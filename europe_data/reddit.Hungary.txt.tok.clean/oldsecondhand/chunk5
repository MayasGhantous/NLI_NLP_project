  the mom-and-pop shop owner will call the multinationals jews and the beggars gypsies ; he hates both group . 
  you need much less for low-tech subsistence farming , but it ai n't be pretty . 
   you officially count as `` employed '' in greece if you work one hour per week . 
  not really surprising , it 's true even for our homegrown tv series . 
  i thought pogroms mean beating up / killing minorities / destruction of their property . 
  no such thing happened in of these hungarian guard marches as far as i know . 
  `` in 2008-2009 a number of hungarian roma were injured and six killed , including an infant , in a series of murderous pogroms . '', 
  and the murderers were caught and put on trial . 
  they confessed that they had previously members of the hungarian guard , but they were disillusioned with their impotence . 
  my main gripe with this article is that it makes it seem , that such violent acts are still an ongoing phenomenon . 
  you can blame jobbik and the hungarian guard for using hateful speech against gypsies , but they do n't organize pogroms . 
  greece has a blasphemy law too which was n't used until recently . 
  well , technically it 's the restoration of a public domain artwork , so no copyright , sorry . 
  well , those eastern european countries have free higher education ; on economic policies they 're rather left-wing . 
  hungarian news : http://www.budapesttimes.hu/ http://www.politics.hu/, 
  maybe they 're poor because they have authoritarian leaders ? 
  theocracies usually are authoritarian . 
  i always suspected the antinuke movement is financed by the coal lobby . 
  there are no that many ways to generate baseload power : coal , hydro or nuclear . 
  and they only protest against hydro and nuclear . 
  it can . 
  the big selling point for the euro was lowered cost of doing international commerce , and saving money for tourists . 
  at the moment i 'm not sure it 's worth all the baggage that it 's coming with ; most euro zone countries were violating the maastricht criteria even before the crisis . 
  switzerland is n't in the eu , thus not in the common border known as schengen area . 
  well , i do n't really get it . 
  the statistics i quoted contradicted my previous expectation about jobbik . 
  expected less support from youth . 
  i looked up for stats for you , it says jobbik has support of 30 % among people below 37 , and has the most atheist supporters after the green-leftist lmp . 
  http://nol.hu/belfold/a_fiatalok_harmada_a_jobbikra_szavazna http://www.hir24.hu/belfold/2012/02/08/az-ateista-fiatalok-kedvence-volt-a-jobbik-2011-ben/ my personal observation is that the voters of fidesz and jobbik has a significiant ideological overlap , of course the official party lines differ . 
  i knew plenty of former [ mi\u00c9p ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_justice_and_life_party ) voters who turned to fidesz . 
  fidesz got quite cozy with the leader mi\u00c9p after 2010 . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istv%c3%a1n_csurka, 
  they 're the same people . 
  they grew up in a totalitarian system , and that 's what they think is normal . 
  with respect to hungary : only after the generation raised during socialism dies out can we expect to start to fix the economy . 
  actually i 'm not surprised at all . 
  a lot of former socialist voters turned to the far-right jobbik at the last hungarian elections . 
  yep , it was all over the news . 
  i collected a few links for the others to see it was talked about in hungarian media : http://nol.hu/belfold/a_jobbik_felvonult_devecser_romak_lakta_utcaiban http://index.hu/belfold/hirek/2012/08/09/a_jogvedok_szerint_a_rendorseg_hibazott_devecseren/ http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20120805-ezren-a-jobbikos-megmozdulason-devecserben.html the `` die gypsies , die '' part was probably from a no name demonstrator , as it was not reported in the news . 
  edit : took a bit time to read the blogpost more thoroughly , and checked the part about bety\u00e1rsereg , and is missing from most maintream reports . 
  although in the atv video they do n't mention ethnic cleansing only ethnic conflict , which is a pretty big difference . 
   `` the genetically coded trash must be exterminated from public life . '', 
  this part is n't in the video either , but they speak about that criminality is genetically coded in gypsies . 
   `` i consider myself a racist , '' tyirity\u00e1n said , `` and i am going to stand up for the cause of not letting our life-space over to an ulterior race . '' this was n't in the video either . 
  of course it 's possible that the parts the blog author is referencing are not recorded in video , still i stay suspicious . 
  i guess it 's an euphemism for crime rate . 
  the reason people were pissed because gyurcsany promised to not introduce tuition fee and not privatise the healthcare system . 
  then they got elected and admitted he lied and they 'll intend to do both . 
  these changes were torpedoed by fidesz by calling a referendum , and it seems fidesz is introducing tuition fees in disguise , and the future of the healthcare system is still in question ( too many doctors emigrating ) . 
  things were never okay , just mainstream news channels are only intrested in sensationalist headlines . 
  slow decline is unintresting . 
  these graphs are more relevant : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/hungary/gdp-growth http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/gdp-growth, 
  what does this have to do with the monetary union ? 
  you 're correct , that 's the gross minimal wage . 
  ( it 's 66 000 huf net ) the 47 000 is for public worker ( those who are unemployed and given a job by government ) , and is net value . 
  i have to add that situation in hungary is similar too . 
  they often got subsidized housing based on the number of children , free healthcare , free schooling up to university , gipsy only scholarschips , but we got only bad press from the west . 
  i 've never seen a demonstration change anything . 
  it was more about the maintaining the territorial integrity of serbia/yugoslavia . 
  ( omg they 're stealing our land . ), 
  stalin himself put uneducated people in charge of banks and factories . 
  yo dawg , i herd you like countries ... 
  yeah , once you 'll die . 
  i agree . 
  my point is that a dictator has executive power , horthy did n't have it . 
  there were democratic elections , and parliamentary representation . 
  was the queen of britain elected ? 
  `` dictatorial version of mannerheim . . '' actually he was n't a dictator either de jure or de facto . 
  hungary was a constitutional monarchy without a king , and horthy played the role of the king , basically having no formal powers . 
  although the control of the military was in his hand . 
  there were such approaches but they do n't have a really big media following . 
  on the other hand there was a reality tv series with a rich gipsy pop musician ala osbourne family style , which only reinforced the stereotypes . 
  ( gy\u0151zike show ) also gipsy kids do n't have many role models , the only succesful gipsy people are musicians ( either pop/rap or classical/folk music ) . 
  hungary has a population of 10 million and there are 800 thousand gipsies . 
  so there are around 400 thousand children , let 's say you only take 70 % of them to foster care , it 's already 280 thousand children . 
  you ca n't just take that many children into foster care , the system was n't designed for that , it would cost a lot of money etc. 
  also , human rights groups would be up in arms and would draw parallels with australian aboriginals ' stolen generation . 
  in hungary there 's a law that says only those can collect child allowance who send their children to school ( there 's a limit on the maximum number of absences ) . 
  but it 's not rare that the parents threaten the teachers if they do n't get their way . 
  the problem is so widespread that these posters are in schools and hospitals : http://m.cdn.blog.hu/va/vastagbor/image/2010/10/matrica.jpg it says : assault of public service workers is punished by 3-5 year of prison . 
  [ this ] ( http://hvg.hu/itthon/20101025_orvosok_bantalmazasa_plakat ) article says that in the past ten years the number of assaults against healthcare workers doubled . 
  the director of the county hospital says , they had 45 incidents that year ( by oct 25 ) . 
  lajos sz\u00f6gi was lynched in olaszliszka , hungary in 2006 when he hit roma girl with a car and got out to check whether she was hurt . 
   but rather , a gift from the indo-european gods of cheap labor the problem in eastern europe is high unemployment . 
  there 's no lack of people willing to work for minimum wage . 
  in hungary there 're even public work programmes that pay below minimum wage . 
  ( minimum wage around net $ 281 ( 66 000 huf ) , public work programme pay $ 200 ( 47 000 huf ) ) . 
  public opinion is hard to change , there 's white flight even in western countries . 
  are n't blaming germany and blaming the banks the same ? 
  it was german banks that were indirectly bailed out . 
  edit : spelling, 
  does anyone care about eurovision ? 
  the clip says it 's the most viewed non-sport event , but i do n't know anyone who cares the slightest bit . 
  post soviet states are all a bit like that . 
  high unemployment , shitty wages . 
  many young people plan to go abroad , and it 's harder to do with a family . 
   if greece would n't be part of the eurozone they would still face austerity in the form of external devaluation . 
  external devaluation devalues rent and food prices too . 
  only import products would cost more . 
   i do n't know how communism made us loose the animation in rodins work , the details in roman-greek statues , or the liquidity of brancusi , but it has , and now we must suffer the half-assed bronze work of pre-commie carrier artists . 
  there are a quite a few technically well made commie statues .
