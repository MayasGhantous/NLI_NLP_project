  they lied to all those people who are now starting their journeys that they are all welcome in germany . 
  they are not . 
  it 's impossible . 
  and then germany will have to blame someone for what happened . 
  somehow they will twist the story so that the v4 , eastern states and hungary will be the scapegoat . 
  well , bavaria ca n't really act independently of the federal german government . 
  bavarian pm seehofer is already heavily criticized for inviting orb\u00e1n , because the german public watches german news and has no idea about anything . 
  you ca n't really . 
  they are making sure that it would be illegal . 
  germany could easily make the legal situation clear by handing out temporary visas to migrants . 
  of course that would encourage even more to come and germany would be flooded by 10 million by the end of the year , but still , that would be a legal option . 
  the current situation is disgusting because the law and refugeeswelcome are clashing . 
  the bavarian prime minister supports hungary in the defence of the border . 
  obviously the real pictures are crying women and children gassed by the brutal police !, 
  because croatia transports them right to the border crossings with hungary . 
  croatian pm even admitted on tv that they are `` forcing '' ( with this word ) hungary to take them in by transporting them there with buses and trains . 
  these things somehow do n't reach the general german and austrian public , just accusations as if hungary were some evil daemon . 
  you were mocking my remark as if it 's on the level of 9/11 conspiracy . 
  but they are already doing that . 
  180,000 have registered in hungary and they ran away from hungary very quickly to germany . 
  they 've already broken the law . 
  the same law . 
  they moved from the country that is processing their asylum case to a different eu country . 
  same situation . 
  but merkel welcomed these law breaking asylum seekers and will give them german asylum . 
  there 's no problem with germany giving them asylum , but she 's encouraging illegal behavior . 
  she could have created an official legal framework , but somehow it was her interest to create chaos and create tension between humanitarian/moral/emotional aspects and the law . 
  countries are supposed to make people register , but they refuse and emotionally seen we ca n't force them to go and register . 
  but legally we also ca n't let them go , nor can we let them in unless they do it at the designated entry points . 
  but enforcing that needs fences but that clashes with the emotional/media aspect again . 
  instead , she could 've issued temporary visas to them if she decided to welcome them . 
  nobody can seriously think that hungary can host 230,000 migrants , so * de facto * it is expected that they go through hungary , but it 's an illegal process , so hungary is supposed to hold them back , but then media outcry etc. 
  really , just give as many of them visas that germany is willing to host . 
  then it 's legally clarified and they can travel to germany very simply , without any chaos . 
  no , it was you who compared it to 9/11 conspiracy . 
  sure , the two alternatives are either believing that politicians simply tell their true opinions all the time and use no short-term or mid-term communication tactics * or * believing in world-wide conspiracies . 
  you ca n't keep them in romania or estonia . 
  hungary is willing to voluntarily offer to take a few thousand refugees ( around 2000 as you wrote ) . 
  that 's no problem . 
  the problem is if they want to put huge , refugee sorting centers ( `` hot spots '' ) here or if they want to make use of dublin and deport a large number of the 180,000 people that we registered here . 
  quotas are bad , because they are percentages . 
  if we do n't stop the influx , then it 's like signing a blank paper . 
  we can only talk about concrete numbers and only voluntarily . 
  the eu has nothing to do with this and it 's reaching out of its actual powers now . 
  fidesz started talking about immigration after the charlie hebdo attacks , then sent a disgustingly biased `` national consultation '' questionnaire to each citizen , created advertisement posters saying `` you ca n't take the jobs of hungarians away '' to migrants in hungarian language , etc. 
  it 's about artificially accelerated change . 
  not natural changes over the decades , like multiplying faster or slower . 
  i updated my long answer with a subtitled video of a public speech of a jobbik leader talking very harshly about migrants . 
  they talk quite differently in the parliament and on the streets . 
  they do n't call themselves racists . 
  they are against gypsies , like most far-right parties in countries where there is a large number of gypsies . 
  oh , they are extremely harsh on migrants , they call them intruders and so on . 
  [ here is a speech from the 5th of september ] ( http://www.amara.org/en/videos/cpqwosq7ll18/info/magyarorszag-a-magyaroke-z-karpat-daniel-frakciovezeto-helyettes-a-jobbik-alelnoke-beszede/ ) . 
  this was at the time when they marched on the hungarian motorway . 
  i do n't know much about golden dawn , i do n't follow greek politics as much . 
  greek politics is shown a lot more in germany than elsewhere ( like hungary ) due to the involvement in their financial crisis . 
  well , they would say `` radical right '' , not far-right , but it 's a pretty common description . 
  i do n't like debating labels too much , it 's always pretty irrational and emotional . 
   he mentioned bringing back all troops and that hungary should not be contributing to the humanitarian problems with the military , which does not at all sound like a far right position . 
  far right here in eastern-central europe is different from other places . 
  it includes protesting against a so called economic and political `` colonization '' , being forced to play by the book of big countries etc. 
  so bringing back the military and stopping contributions to foreign wars of the big powers is in line with this . 
  some context : he proposed bringing back the border guards or border patrol , a separate authority that existed until 2007 , when it was abolished due to being in the eu and preparations for schengen , as we needed less border guarding . 
  police took over this task . 
  now he wants it back . 
  i see no problem with that but also not too much to be gained . 
  their real mood is playing mostly to people who see themselves as oppressed by foreign powers , who are poor , not listened to , have problems with living together with gypsies etc. 
  these people are of course anti-immigration , because they see it as something forced from the outside , something that weakens the social welfare system , something that brings people who wo n't integrate similarly to gypsies . 
  they are also against israel and jewish influence , support palestine , iran and russia . 
  the president of jobbik spoke at a `` day of arab-hungarian friendship '' 5 years ago and said `` islam is the last hope of humanity '' , but he says everyone has to live their culture on their own land . 
  they do n't talk about religion much , but they have a hungarian christian double cross in their logo and erected big wooden crosses in the advent time before christmas in several places . 
  they also like to speak about the glorious past of hungary and the origin of hungarians , they are against the treatment that hungarian minorities get in neighboring countries ( no autonomy , the issue of no free language use in slovakia some years back ) . 
  they probably want to unify the hungarian territories at some point but do n't see it realistic now . 
  they do n't really have a chance in the next election in my opinion . 
  but they are getting more and more popular , they are the most popular party among people under 30 at 27 % , while the governing fidesz has 16 % in this demographic . 
  they are popular among students , and also among villagers in the poor regions . 
  they started as more radical , now they are trying to become more of a `` people 's party '' , with cute advertisements with dogs and kids and a youthful `` colorful '' image . 
  there are also some internal fights between the more extreme parts and the not so extreme parts ( the president being in the latter ) . 
  many hard-liners think they got too mild since they are in the parliament so these supporters have formed various more extreme organizations ( like bety\u00e1rsereg ) .

  it was just after those marching on the motorway were taken by buses to the austrian border by hungarian authorities . 
  so a lot has happened since that was n't known back then . 
  it 's for the political show , to designate a boogeyman . 
  i think this whole thing is a show . 
  merkel probably made an unofficial agreement with orb\u00e1n to be the bad cop . 
  hungary registered about 180,000 of the 220,000 migrants who entered this year . 
  recently , there have been unregistered people from croatia who we de facto `` pass on '' to austria . 
  these people entered the eu first in greece , then in croatia . 
  austria usually also just passes them on without additional checks and registration towards germany . 
  hungary takes them to the registration camps near the austrian border on the hungarian side , but they are n't physically forced to go and register . 
  they are given accommodation there , if they choose , but they rather continue their way to germany . 
  360 eur is pretty decent , though ( above accommodation ) . 
  for example it 's not an unusual salary in romania i think . 
  context : he made a speech , to which faction leaders replied and this is the reply to the replies .

  [ link to official english and hungarian version ] ( http://www.police.hu/hirek-es-informaciok/legfrissebb-hireink/bunugyek/kozlemeny-announcement ), 
  orb\u00e1n never said that they are organized with the purpose of destabilizing europe . 
  what is stupid ? 
  more manpower is needed for the protection of the border , so the army can now join the police and do the same stuff that the police can already do and has been doing . 
  up till now the army was n't allowed to do these things , but the police was .
