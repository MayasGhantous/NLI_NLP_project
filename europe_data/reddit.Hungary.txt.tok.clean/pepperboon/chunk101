  it does n't mean that it 's illegal for a 15-year-old to * drink * a p\u00e1linka , or for the parents to give it to him . 
  i 'd say a fr\u00f6ccs is already acceptable from around 14 . 
  texas most definitely belongs to `` the south '' . 
  in practical use in hungary , it 's often v4 + slovenia ( + croatia ) . 
  in everyday language , germany and austria are western europe for us . 
  if you explicitly ask what countries are part of central europe , then people may include germany and austria , but in practical everyday * use * of the term , not so much . 
  it matters most if you 're in one of these countries ( please do n't confuse them in the * cities * themselves , that 's just facepalm ) . 
  it 's not that people will be mad , but you 'll look ignorant and people will reinforce their stereotype about geographically ignorant american . 
  that 's a nice gesture , but i would n't say it 's the * correct * pronunciation , it 's rather the * hungarian * pronunciation . 
  `` paree '' is n't the correct pronunciation of paris , it 's the french one . 
  but some hungarians think otherwise ( and i think they are wrong ) . 
  either way , it does show you read stuff and are interested , so it 's a good sign . 
  well , i guess there is n't much more to discuss in such a pan-european sub . 
  this is a very generic `` tell me about your culture '' question that is very open-ended . 
  also the nature of reddit is that things get asked over and over again . 
  platforms like stackexchange avoid this much better , but then again , they serve a different purpose . 
   currently party politics in sweden is a shitstorm . 
  i guess that 's about immigration . 
  but in other topics i assume people are satisfied with how the country is governed . 
  and as far as i know it 's even better in norway , because immigration is n't such a big problem there . 
  i guess part of it is a cultural difference . 
  around here politicians are rarely praised like this . 
  we 're usually very critical of politicians and there 's no single person you could choose where there would be an all-national agreement of respect . 
  if you praise a politician , you 're from then on part of `` that side '' . 
  i think this is quite different in scandinavia where people are generally pleased with how things are going and there 's a lot less corruption . 
  the weird thing for me is that the main thrust of what he sings is n't ironic or disparaging , he is actually unironically praising him , plus those parts where his body is described as if he was muscly , it just does n't fit for me . 
  some elements look like mocking , some seem belittling ( he simply plays golf and looks at maps with celebrities , or stands in heavy rain when he 's sad ) . 
  i mean , such kind of a song would make sense for me more if they were criticizing the un for just being a bunch of useless old guys who think they are someones . 
  but that 's obviously not the case here , so hence my confusion . 
  catchy tune , but i do n't really get the context . 
  scandinavian humor seems to be different than our more sour kind here in east/central europe . 
  ah , interesting . 
  it 's actually originally from hungary . 
  romania was supposedly the first country outside hungary where they introduced it . 
  the original brand name is `` p\u00f6tty\u00f6s '' meaning `` dotty '' . 
  more info : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%bar%c3%b3_rudi, 
  do a google image search for `` alulj\u00e1r\u00f3 '' , that 's how we call it in hungarian . 
  also , i 'm not sure what kind of underpass you mean , there are [ these creepy ones ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bsl2uw-1kkw/maxresdefault.jpg ) or these [ modern ones ] ( http://iho.hu/img/vasut/1403/140327_010/--img_1566.jpg ) . 
  also , would a metro station qualify ? 
  those are pretty nice on the new m4 line in budapest . 
  the big issue is who would be the king ? 
  we do n't really like the habsburg dynasty . 
  this was even a problem after wwi . 
  then the decision was to keep calling ourselves `` kingdom of hungary '' , but have no king and be ruled by a regent . 
  now , we could theoretically elect a king from a totally new family ( as it happened several times in around 1300-1600 ) , but i do n't really see any point in that . 
  there are a few advocates for it , mostly because they long for a more upright , moral , divine-ruled , heroic , whatever , idealized picture of a monarchy . 
  as if the crown would magically transform everything into the `` good old traditional times '' . 
  sometimes in hungary we have `` 20 km '' or `` 50 km '' written , i do n't know why and how they decide it . 
  [ like this ] ( http://24.p3k.hu/app/uploads/2012/09/kresz2.jpg ) . 
  but it 's rather rare . 
  not always clear , if you are n't used to how they mark it in a different country . 
  in germany for example , it 's often just one sign at the beginning of the street and then just the color of the pavement is reddish in one part ( for bikes ) and grayish on the other part ( pedestrians ) . 
  this `` color-coding '' is not used in hungary for example . 
  in hungary , bike lanes are usually on street level , the rightmost lane before the curb . 
  people may also not be used to the [ shared spaces ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shared_space ) found in western europe and not having the usual curb for orientation may confuse them . 
  or they may come from countries where - although there are rules in place - such things are n't taken very seriously and everyone just goes where they think it 's best . 
  also , not every country has so many people who bike , so they may think `` nothing will happen if i walk on the bike lane for a little bit , maybe one bike comes , but can easily go around me '' , and then gets surprised by the high bike traffic . 
  [ t\u00far\u00f3 rudi ] ( http://www.budapestagent.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/turo-rudi.jpg ) ( [ another pic ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/turo_rudi_-_broken_in_half.jpg ) ) , it 's cottage cheese covered in chocolate . 
  very weird for foreigners due to the combination of sourish and sweet flavours , so it 's not exported much . 
  it 's one of the most frequent things that hungarians crave when far from home for a long time . 
  in hungarian cuisine , cottage cheese fits well with sweets , we have many cookies and cakes with it and there 's also t\u00far\u00f3s t\u00e9szta ( cottage cheese pasta ) with sugar on top . 
  happens very rarely , so i 'd be surprised first and foremost . 
  also , i mostly have no idea what they are trying to say ( pronunciation and intonation are quite different from other languages ) , so i 'll smile and appreciate them trying and then suggest talking in english . 
  it 's quite difficult for foreigners to learn even just a small amount of hungarian , because the words are all very different , the sentence structure is different etc. 
  even if i answered in hungarian , they most likely would n't understand and the point is usually just to show their respect by trying . 
  if they * actually * want to talk in hungarian , then we can of course , but they 'd have to make that very clear . 
  if it 's just some random film on tv or a random series while i 'm bored and channel surfing , then dub . 
  if it 's something that i specifically seek out and sit down to concentrate and watch it , then subs . 
  i do n't like the quality of dubs , they often change a lot of the meaning , the tone of voice gets lost etc. 
  immersion is better with subs . 
  i usually watch things with english subs . 
  yeah , i agree . 
  but you should also take into account that we are n't as chatty with strangers as americans ( i think that also applies to the netherlands but i think less than to us ) , so the bothering thing would n't necessarily be that they want to talk to you , just that they are there so close . 
   idk if this is just me but that always makes me think `` these are almost certainly jobbik supporters '' not really . 
  they are just for foreign tourists and marketing . 
  it 's a fake magyarosch thing . 
  not even jobbik supporters wear this `` csik\u00f3s '' stuff . 
  i do n't think people believe much stuff about hungary . 
  but if they do , then stereotypical stuff is paprika , goulash , puszta ( die pu\u00dfta ) , balaton . 
  they may believe we 're more into horse stuff than we are . 
  or [ this stuff ] ( http://img1.indafoto.hu/5/7/59117_bd2cc5d4e9a0b676777d6519dd3e7c0d/19284695_7053ef5b148199ffe1b05adc23b69426_xl.jpg ) , which is often used as cover pictures for books about hungary . 
  it 's a fake tradition , these clothes were never widespread , and more importantly there are n't any people who live like this today . 
  or they might believe we 're slavic . 
  [ an example in hungary ] ( http://aquatherma.hu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/kemping-zalaegerszeg8-1024x768.jpg ) these people are n't hikers , they often just stay in this place , cook their meals outside , and if they are near a lake then go for a little swim . 
  it 's often really packed and it 's not some very exciting experience . 
  but if people like this way of relaxing , then why not ... 
  are these before or after taxes ? 
  article a ) the name of our country shall be hungary . 
   minus serbia because they themselves do n't seem to want to join [ does n't seem so ] ( http://dailynewshungary.com/hungarian-foreign-minister-meet-serbians-eu-integration-minister/ ), 
  before the unification of buda and pest ( and \u00d3buda ) in 1873 , the area was usually called pest-buda . 
  so if they had kept that name after the unification then there would be no confusion with bucharest . 
  but the consonant cluster '' . . stb . . '' is a bit difficult to pronounce . 
  depends on how often you do it . 
  commuting 100 miles per direction every day is definitely unusual in europe , but not that rare in the us . 
  i think it 's pretty fitting , at least for such a short catchphrase . 
  it is true that in the us a building from the 19th century would be considered ancient by most people . 
  european churches and castles often date from the middle ages and 19th century buildings are very common . 
  and americans also drive a lot larger distances and usually put up with working very far away etc. 
  in europe a few hundred km usually means a different country , a different landscape and climate , while if you take a look at states like texas , there are huge distances between nearby cities and towns that basically all look the same ( same landscape , same climate , same language , same culture ) . 
  okay , so in the first 4 years of primary school ( ages 6/7 -9 / 10 ) we have one teacher who teaches all subjects .
