  christianity used to be like a medieval eu or un . 
  what these christians are saying is totally against the literal teachings of christianity . 
  of course christianity is just as hypocritical as any other ideology . 
  turn your other cheek and love your enemy etc. . . 
  i 'm saying this as an atheist , and i think it 's misguided to see this as a christianity vs islam thing . 
  it 's modern secularism and freedom vs medieval superstitious bigotry among many of the migrants ( not all , sure ) . 
  you ca n't easily undo childhood and adolescence , being brought up in a vastly different value system . 
  unfortunately many news reports do n't talk about the attacks just about tear gassing innocent children . 
  the quotas would set a precedent for distributing migrants based on majority decisions instead of unanimous decisions . 
  we can not accept this . 
  it 's not only syria . 
  there 's iraq , afghanistan , eritrea , libya , somalia , pakistan , bangladesh , niger , etc. 
  and we do n't want a few million foreign nationals forced on us either . 
  when the hungarian people make such a decision then okay . 
  meanwhile anyone who is eligible for asylum by international law , will get it . 
  but no economic migrants . 
  nobody believes it is about 3000 people . 
  millions are coming . 
  also , they did n't just `` continue to enter '' , they tore up the gate and then started throwing rocks and pieces of concrete at the police . 
  then police used tear gas . 
  obviously . 
  it infuriates me when they twist it like this in international media . 
  the migrants even climbed on a duty free shop 's roof and threw rocks from there . 
  but that 's not important , they just `` continued to enter '' . 
  [ video : breaking through the first line of defense ( a gate ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrpwaeme0c ) [ video : then attacking the riot police directly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay_mlcssdzw ) edit : a few interesting things : 0:10 , 0:28 what kind of father brings their child to the front line in a confrontation with riot police in full gear and shields ? 
  1:30 why drag that girl to the police spraying tear gas and to the area where the invaders are throwing rocks ? 
  just to get a bit of tear gas that will look great on camera a second later , when the tv crews conveniently do n't show what happened before . 
  but they really had no chance . 
  there was riot police , counter-terrorism , army , tanks everything in the background . 
  [ video of these ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yzbhkoes_8 ) . 
  edit2 : and now that you watched this , see what the [ al jazeera journalist ( okay he 's a devout muslim , but still ) asks ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/upfront/2015/09/arena-hungary-fences-refugees-150926145628355.html ) the government spokesman : '' ** would jesus have approved of your tear gassing of syrian children last week ? 
  ** '' first sentence of the article : `` refugees trekking hundreds of kilometres in search of safety and a better life ** were greeted with tear gas ** by hungarian police at the serbian border , resulting in widespread condemnation . '', 
  borders are totally open , totally open for anybody . 
  no questions , no papers needed , nothing . 
  just come and be welcome and get benefits . 
  many are n't syrian who are coming now . 
  and more and more people see this on tv , read it in newspapers , hear it from friends and they are setting off . 
  if germany wants them all , perfectly fine . 
  their decision . 
  but forcing others to follow suit is not fine . 
  so just let the 10 millions in . 
  100 millions ? 
  1 billion ? 
  as if anything in this article implies that he wants zero immigrants in hungary ... 
  he even talked about how good it is to have kebab places on the great boulevard of budapest or buying lamb from a syrian butcher for easter . 
  it 's about quick mass immigration that we are talking about now . 
  good luck mass deporting millions of people . 
  how do you stop them from entering europe if you do n't want fences , walls and military action ? 
  `` poor people from refugee camps around syria ( where their head is not being cut off ) , iraq , afghanistan , libya , pakistan , bangladesh and from unstable regions of africa etc. '', 
  40 million is `` totally manageable '' too . 
  i mean the universe wo n't explode . 
  something will happen . 
  the question really is what europe wants . 
  the frog is being boiled slowly , without confronting the actual real question . 
  we will see . 
  millions are on the way , now even the un admits this . 
  you seem to be stuck in last year . 
  just this year more than a million will come . 
  next year more . 
  poor people from refugee camps around syria ( where their head is not being cut off ) , iraq , afghanistan , libya , pakistan , bangladesh and from unstable regions of africa etc. 
  they want to come to europe . 
  it 's bullshit that they do n't . 
  most do n't have the opportunity , they are so poor . 
  do n't tell me someone who 's practically a slave would n't want to go to germany to get housing and benefits and a much better life . 
  it 's a lie . 
  they all want to come , millions , tens of millions . 
  simply not all believe it 's possible yet . 
  soon your rhetoric will be updated and we 'll talk about 50 million being only 10 percent of the eu , which is still very far from the majority and we should n't play fearmongering as it 's clearly still a minority . 
  we 'll see graphics showing 10 european stick figures + 1 migrant , illustrating how little influence this means . 
  i found that germans are n't really direct at all . 
  they like to hint at things and expect things to be implicitly understood , not having to spell it out . 
  also , open talks about topics that are at least a bit sensitive do n't really happen in public , not even in pubs , only at home . 
  this is also true at the workplace or when discussing projects . 
  they like to talk in fancy sentences about rules and project plans while avoiding common sense elephants in the room . 
  maybe germans are direct compared to americans , but i think eastern/central europe is much more direct . 
  i also found finns to be more direct and blunt . 
  of course these are isolated impressions , but what else can we do in such a thread . 
  i think there 's still quite a lot of pressure on you from politicians . 
  do you mean , with papers and visa , or just walking over the border ? 
  can anyone come ? 
  i asked can * all * poor people come ? 
  100 thousand ? 
  1 million ? 
  10 million ? 
  100 million ? 
  1 billion ? 
  i know that some of them can come . 
  but how many can come and how do we decide who can come ? 
  until now , i thought we had laws in place to decide this . 
  but evidently , nope , anyone can come without papers . 
  some people are in fact really poor in hungary ( less than in some other eu countries , but still ) . 
  so , what 's your point ? 
  they are in the free movement area of the eu . 
  i asked : can all the very poor people of the world come to europe or not ? 
  if not , why can people come from turkey or jordan or lebanon , but not from nigeria , congo , bangladesh , rwanda or indeed kosovo ? 
  ( not saying these are the same level of poverty ) . 
  politicians are usually lawyers , bureaucrats , liberal arts people . 
  they are easily swayed by flashy enough science-y sounding proposals . 
  ~ ~ ~ woo , science , brains , simulation , holograms , reading thoughts , woo ~ ~ ~ these parts of the article sum it up well :  he argued that big science was responsible for `` the injection of a ** journalistic flavor ** '' into research , `` which is fundamentally in conflict with the scientific method '' -- a situation in which ** `` the spectacular rather than the perceptive becomes the scientific standard . '' ** he further worried that with huge sums of money available to researchers , `` one sees evidence of scientists ' ** spending money instead of thought ** . ''  funders at the european commission , who seem to have ** looked less closely at the proposal 's scientific feasibility than at its potential economic and political payoff ** . 
   `` is there any politician who would n't love to stand up and say , ** ` we europeans are building a brain ' ?
