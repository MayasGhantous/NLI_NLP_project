  the most important question is what will happen when they reach bicske , where the refugee camp is ? 
  it will happen soon ( a couple of hours maybe ) . 
  more economic and humanitarian yes . 
  but illegal . 
  one nod from empress merkel and the trains are on their way . 
  people are driving some vans full of water beside/behind them , afaik . 
  or something like that . 
  they also stop to take breaks every now and then in the shade under some intersections ... 
  sure , but the train company can not take a train full of people who do n't have the necessary papers to leave hungary . 
  that would be illegal . 
  however , they are free to go anywhere they like inside hungary . 
  of course nobody should be allowed to walk on the motorway , but it seems that police does n't want to escalate any conflict with them . 
  they will get tired and stop at some point . 
  in other parts of the country they are escaping from the refugee camps , or do n't get off the trains near the refugee camps . 
  you ca n't forcefully put them in the camps , because they are open facilities and not prisons . 
  previously hungary also had the legal tools to create closed camps , but the eu ruled against those , so now we only have open camps . 
  let 's see what austria and germany react . 
  5-6 days and they walk through to austria where the austrian authorities can show how welcoming they are . 
  in the sense that i live nearby and this is totally crazy and i feel physically dizzy and nauseous in my stomach . 
  austria is 200 km from here . 
  where the hell are they walking in the sun ?

   this little sideshow should he let them board trains to munich ? 
   to make life difficult for a small number of people they are not willing to go to the refugee camps . 
  they go on a hunger strike in the trains and refuse to cooperate . 
  suggestions , please !, 
  there is a new refugee camp under construction near the southern border . 
  what should hungary do in your opinion ? 
  are you saying orb\u00e1n should let them board trains to munich ? 
   i was speaking with a rather prominent undercover hungarian policeman recently -- said the random redditor, 
  that 's what they are trying now . 
  they are gathering a crowd to walk there ... video : http://index.indavideo.hu/video/ebreszto_6b01?utm_source=flash&amp;utm_medium=watchoninda&amp;utm_campaign=videoplayer let 's see if anyone stops them . 
  except that germany and austria made it clear that hungary is not allowed to let refugees on the trains towards germany . 
  they need to be registered in hungary . 
  are you saying hungary should violate international law and go against what merkel asked ? 
  oh , i did n't know that . 
  any link or info about their reasoning ? 
   a lot of men are very aggressive a small minority . 
  most of them know that if they hurt a police officer their chance for asylum is minuscule . 
  they are in passive resistance now . 
  we already had like 4 posts about this in the last 12 hours . 
  news say that now 500 refugees are going to protest in front of the german embassy in budapest ... 
  i 'm not sure what they expect . 
  germany wo n't accept unregistered people . 
  that 's never the case . 
  the law is not all that matters . 
  germany could at least help out unofficially , stating what they expect to be done . 
  i think they are in communication behind the scenes , but german media is building the narrative of the evil hungarians doing evil stuff without having any suggestion besides vague things like `` be nicer to them '' . 
  there is chaos among police and the usual shitty communication of the shitty railway company . 
  hungarian authorities do n't really know what to do with the people now . 
  they must be registered , but they do n't want it . 
  they are on hunger strike outside bicske , and refuse to go to the refugee camp . 
  they throw away the water bottles that police gives them . 
  at this point , i would really like if austrian and german authorities helped out , and said what they expect to be done . 
  to finish their journey from turkey and get to germany as they planned ? 
  all want to go further . 
  they want asylum in hungary just as much that they wanted it in greece , macedonia or serbia , i.e. 
  not at all . 
  no shopping involved . 
  germany invites , people go . 
  there are around 13 officially recognized nationalities in hungary . 
  because it is specifically germany that invites them . 
  do n't pretend you do n't understand . 
  they leave turkey because they hear how much germany welcomes them . 
  also , there are millions of syrian refugees in turkey and the middle east . 
  the countries on the `` balkan route '' are just the road towards germany . 
  they are simply travelling through . 
  now they feel stranded in the middle of their journey . 
  well , the 3 main stations are called `` eastern '' , `` western '' and `` southern '' . 
  today these names are not very meaningful anymore , it 's neither describes their location accurately , nor the direction of the trains . 
  refugees/migrants have zero idea or interest in the governments of the road-countries : greece , macedonia , serbia , hungary , austria . 
  they want to go to germany from day 1 . 
  that 's what they care about . 
  it 's a lie to say they specifically dislike hungary . 
  they did n't even apply for asylum in austria . 
  they do n't know much about european countries . 
  they know germany welcomes them , so they took a journey from turkey to germany , but now they are stranded midway . 
  you have no idea . 
   which do n't exist in hungary according to their constitution wrong . 
  a part of them are real refugees who want to seek asylum in germany , due to the willkommenskultur . 
   and not every single person coming through wants to go to germany that 's more or less within statistical error bounds . 
  but terms like `` white guilt '' are not really in common discourse . 
  this may be hard to understand for you . 
  europe is a lot less clear cut than the mainly black/white racial situation in the us . 
  here we have many different countries with very different levels of development and economies . 
  an englishman may look down on romanian or polish people , even though they are all white . 
  the main issue is not really race in europe . 
  edit : southern europeans often have darker skin but nobody really cares . 
  gypsies usually also have darker skin , but that 's not the important factor for most people . 
  yes , because unfortunately politicians are not really allowed to change their mind . 
  they must first find some fake reason ... 
  this skin-color obsession is more of an american thing , i 'd say . 
  race is not even a part of educated and official discourse here . 
  we have no `` race '' entry in our ids or birth certificates or any documents , and it seems really weird that the us does this . 
  we do n't really talk about `` white people '' as such in europe ( except some far-right groups ) . 
  part of a statement by the hungarian government , the reason why refugee trains were let to munich on sunday , but not afterwards :  on sunday , the [ hungarian ] government requested assistance from the german ministry of the interior , he [ j\u00e1nos l\u00e1z\u00e1r , hungarian minister overseeing the office of the prime minister ] continued , and said : it is typical of the german position that the [ german ] ** minister told ambassador ** [ of hungary in berlin ] j\u00f3zsef czukor ** to allow 250-300 people to board the trains and not to tell the press ** . 
  the reason migrants have been increasingly impatient and aggressive and have refused to cooperate with the hungarian authorities since sunday is that the german government is not communicating its message clearly and explicitly , he explained .
