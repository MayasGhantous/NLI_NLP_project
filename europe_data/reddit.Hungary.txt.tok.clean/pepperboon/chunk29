  refugee applicants sent on their way are not under official measures that would restrict their personal freedom . 
   -  ** [ specially designed cargo space - with video ( and pictures ) ] ( http://police.hu/hirek-es-informaciok/legfrissebb-hireink/hatarrendeszet/specialisan-kialakitott-rakter-videoval ) **  in addition to 20 illegal immigrants , the smuggler was also captured by the b\u00e1cs-kiskun county police . 
   kecskem\u00e9t police inspected a small truck with italian license plates at 1 september 2015 6:45 , on the m5 highway leading to the capital , at the 62 kilometer , driven by a 22-year-old serbian man . 
  during the action , officers found 10 syrian and 10 iraqi citizens in the specially designed cargo area , who could not prove their legal presence in hungary , so an aliens policing procedure was initiated against them . 
  b\u00e1cs-kiskun county police department for migration affairs opened an investigation due to reasonable suspicion of human trafficking against the serbian driver - in addition to detention . 
  they were captured at the sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r service area of m7 motorway . 
   fej\u00e9r county police is carrying out criminal proceedings due to reasonable suspicion of human trafficking against a 24-year-old romanian citizen . 
   according to the available data , the man transported 29 iraqi citizents without valid travel documents in return for payment , in a renault truck with french license plates , with the goad of providing them illegal help in crossing the border . 
  the car and the passengers were stopped on 1 september 2015 at 23:35 on the m7 motorway service area in sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r by national tax and customs office staff . 
  the romanian man was taken to fej\u00e9r county police headquarters , where he was interrogated as a suspect and was taken into criminal custody . 
  it 's not our choice that we do n't let them get on the trains . 
  germany and austria made it clear that dublin regulations are still in place and merkel said `` germany has no responsibility '' about the refugees that are currently in hungary , her statement about accepting all syrians was just about those who are already there . 
  so that 's it . 
  hungarian authorities have no choice . 
  i do n't know the solution , but i 'm sure it wo n't be hungary that will solve such a huge geopolitical crisis . 
  we are just an intermediate station in this migration route . 
  what do you know about living costs in eastern eu members , like hungary , slovakia or romania ? 
  how would locals in bulgaria feel if refugees were getting more eu welfare than their full-time salary ? 
  but if you give money to augment every bulgarian citizen 's salary to 600 $ , then they 'll probably accept the refugee deal . 
  i agree that they should be given water and sandwiches , etc. 
  temporarily . 
  for a few days . 
  but it 's insane to try to care for thousands of people in the city center for more time than that . 
  but i guess soon they will leave and cross to austria either with smugglers or just by walking across the border . 
  there 's no other solution . 
  we are n't prepared for this amount of people . 
  we ca n't pretend to be sweden , we do n't have the necessary resources . 
  austria and germany should let the trains through . 
  they say they welcome them . 
  you ca n't just prance around inviting people with the promise of welfare and paradise and then block them out in the last moment . 
  zero refugees came to hungary because they intend ( or ever intended ) to stay in hungary . 
  their destination is germany . 
  so unless they can get to germany , or hungary suddenly gets as rich as germany , the problem remains . 
  keleti is not a refugee camp . 
  the mayor wants to create a new temporary place of care ( verseny utca ) , though . 
  but actually if these people are refugees then they should go to bicske , v\u00e1mosszabadi or debrecen . 
  those are refugee camps . 
  the center of budapest is not a refugee camp . 
  but since we ca n't lock them into the camps , so they will crowd up at the railway station . 
  no money . 
  by the way , their immediate needs are covered and we also have volunteers helping them . 
  tomorrow there will be a demonstration in favor of them . 
  so it 's not like we do n't care for them at all . 
  we simply ca n't pay as much welfare as germany , when our old people get 150 $ pension and our average wage is 490 $ / month after taxes . 
  [ video of locals greeting the arriving refugees with cheers and applause ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om_6xk_sfdq ) ( this is in austria ), 
  two videos about the crowd of thousands around the railway station earlier today : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvjkou96fiw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrkskaqsexc, 
  there was actually some confusion in the morning and many of them were sold tickets , but then the government clarified that they still ca n't board without travel documents . 
  now the cashiers check the travel documents when selling the train tickets ... 
  how else do you think they end up in hungary ? 
  really ? 
  the austrian chancellor [ criticised ] ( http://de.reuters.com/article/topnews/iddekcn0r12oz20150901 ) hungary for the train that we let through yesterday evening ( 2-3000 people arrived in munich ) as it 's against international law . 
  now it 's bad that we follow the law too closely ? 
  what do you want ? 
  that 's why the government wants germany to clarify . 
  merkel said all eu law stays as it was , nobody can enter germany illegally , hungary has to block them . 
  germany has no responsibility for the migrants that are in hungary . 
  [ see my comment here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3j97z3/hungarian_police_confirms_it_wont_let_any_of_the/cunerew ), 
  there are no refugee camps in budapest . 
  [ this is the system ] ( http://mno.hu/data/cikk/1/29/95/62/cikk_1299562/new_150810_belo31.jpg ) . 
  they have to go to a refugee camp , of which there are multiple in the country , such as bicske , 30 km from budapest . 
  also [ there is water ] ( http://budapestbeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-21-at-6.42.39-am-e1440132270598.png ) and shower places . 
  voluteers are giving out food . 
  mayor is planning a temporary place with basic humanitarian supplies a few hundred meters away from keleti . 
  i do n't know what you expect . 
  thousands of people are suddenly rushing in . 
  we are n't prepared for this , but we are doing what we can . 
  i know . 
  but the problem is there is too many of them and they are rushing in illegally without any structure or organization or system . 
  countries in the balkans are letting them flow through , up till hungary , where we ca n't do anything with them because we are eu members and have to follow eu and international laws much closer . 
  so they pile up there . 
  currently 3000 people in front of keleti station . 
  now what ? 
  germany only wants to take those who are illegally dripping through the border control . 
  hopefully the next bunch will choose the serbia - ( bosnia ) - croatia-slovenia-austria route , so they can deal with them . 
  yes , but hungary is not allowed to let them go . 
  so they are forced to cross the next border illegally , too , just as they crossed all others illegally to get till hungary . 
  but austria is strengthening its border control now . 
  but if hungary strengthens its border with serbia then it 's inhumane . 
  so where are human rights now , austria + germany ? 
  translation :  police will continue to perform their duties in full conformity with the provisions of the schengen border control code . 
   over the past five days , groups of illegal immigrants , most of whom call themselves syrian citizens , have appeared in increasing numbers at budapest 's keleti railway station and its surroundings . 
  they say they intend to go to germany via austria and slovakia . 
  the illegal immigrants do not possess valid travel documents or visa necessary for continued travel . 
   in the area of keleti railway station and the surrounding areas it is priority police task to maintain public order , public security , passenger traffic , and traffic of passenger trains . 
  the police states that the keleti railway station area has constant police presence , which varies depending on the number of occupants in public places flexibly . 
  the police presence on 1 september 2015 has been further strengthened due to the drastic increase in the number of illegal immigrants ; civil guards help police activities . 
  the police emphasizes and draws attention to the fact that the hungarian , german and austrian police joint patrol - as every time until now , too - will continue to regularly monitor the budapest-vienna-munich passenger trains . 
  the joint hungarian and slovak police patrol inspects the passenger trains traveling between budapest and bratislava . 
  so how much money do they get ? 
  you ca n't force people to stay in war zones to `` fix '' the country . 
  that 's the whole idea of refugees . 
  and starting an enlightenment now would only help several generations down the road . 
  you wo n't find many `` visionaries '' like that , who will sacrifice their and their family 's life for such abstract reasons . 
  the conflicts and problems of the middle east have been going on for centuries and there 's no end in sight at all . 
  colonial powers left too early and too suddenly . 
  it should have been more gradual . 
  it 's not just something that the small guys can solve . 
  it 's global geopolitics and ideology . 
  it 's not like overthrowing a single bad guy can solve the issue . 
  you 'd need to transform the thinking of the whole region , make them go through a sort of reformation and enlightenment as europe did in the 16th-18th centuries .
