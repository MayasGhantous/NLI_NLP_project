  that 's thrilling ** -- that 's like a moon shot . '', 
  the crisis is not just about syria ... 
  there 's no war in turkey . 
  i know that people are very poor in turkish camps and children ca n't go to school and all that . 
  but it 's not unsafe . 
  i mean , why ca n't the very poor people from all over the world come to europe then ? 
  there are many millions of very poor people living in terrible conditions . 
  wrong !, 
  geneva say that ** only ** about refugees coming * directly * from a country where they are persecuted for race , ethnicity etc. 
  i know perfectly well . 
  but often it can be a `` mitigating circumstance '' if a person can semi-reasonably believe that the enforcement of certain rules is suspended . 
  i know it 's still a crime , but it 's not really elegant to enforce it before announcing it very clearly . 
  it 's as if someone would get arrested or brought before court for consuming marijuana in the netherlands , which is technically illegal but not enforced . 
  i know the analogy is not perfect , but at least a bit similar . 
  and although the government is not a private person , they are also obliged to follow the law , they are n't despots ruling over an empire but elected leaders in a legal framework who are entrusted by the citizens to execute what 's in the law , being the executive branch . 
  simply the sheer mass of people makes enforcement of the law impossible without violence and that 's why germany has suspended enforcing them . 
  but it 's still not consistent and consequential . 
  it 's an unfortunate situation . 
  i 'm just saying that a normal citizen picks up a family on the street and takes them through the schengen-internal border from austria to germany , both of which are pro-migrant countries with willkommenskultur , is really in line with the spirit of the governmental communications . 
  should you rather let them walk ? 
  they are accepted anyway and they make selfies with the smiling merkel . 
  so what is the crime in taking them in your car , from this point of view ? 
  i know the law forbids it , but the whole government is violating the law , there is a crisis where laws do n't seem to matter any more . 
  if a country tries to enforce laws , like hungary , then they are seen as anti-human . 
  so what should the average citizen think ? 
  they are compelled to do illegal things by the implicit messages of the government . 
  because currently there is no legal way for the migrants to enter germany . 
  but they are still all welcome without upper limit . 
  how does that make any sense ? 
  i 'm not saying this guy acted right . 
  i think he broke the law and should get some punishment ( not prison though ) . 
  but the discrepancy between law and state narrative should be closed urgently . 
  having thousands of people violate laws every day under the tolerance of governments can easily confuse people . 
  i hope he does n't have to go to prison . 
  this is a very sad consequence of the mixed communications from governments . 
  it 's a very bad situation . 
  on the one hand the political communication and state media call for welcoming and helping the migrants , on the other hand the law punishes trafficking ( even for free ) . 
  it 's just another two-faced thing in germany now . 
  they expect the migrants to just accidentally find their way to germany somehow , but condemn the people and countries that take part in the process . 
  but they wo n't say that the flow should stop either . 
  because you know that means fences and closing borders , i.e. 
  upholding laws , which is un-european . 
  this kind of situation is extremely bad for people 's sense of law and justice . 
  it 's chaos and undermines the trust in the legal framework of the state . 
  lawlessness should n't be allowed to persist in stable parts of the world . 
  we have governments in power , we are n't in central africa . 
  there is absolutely no reason for this kind of crazy legal chaos and conflicting messages towards citizens . 
  i hope the v4 will come together ( with the new polish government in a few weeks ) and help hungary out if shit gets tough . 
  and it will get tough soon . 
  german and austrian media is already beginning to shift its narrative and anything can happen . 
  i 'm not sure what you do n't understand . 
  the current situation is an illegal status quo of a de facto corridor , but austria does n't really like it officially and could end it any moment ( i 'm not sure how , practically ) . 
  wednesday is a un meeting in new york . 
  orb\u00e1n wants to consult all the relevant leaders and the un general secretary and discuss what should be done : fence or corridor . 
  this is a pressing urgent question now . 
  they ca n't say the usual `` we need intense dialogue and we have to come up with a common solution plan for solidarity and blah blah '' . 
  fence or corridor ? 
  that is the question . 
  if they give no answer or just babble around , then the current law counts and that means the fence must be activated and defended . 
  migrants will riot and will push their children to the front lines of the confrontation just like in r\u00f6szke and we will see some terrible pictures . 
  orb\u00e1n tries to avoid this by touring the leaders now , but i 'm not sure they will say anything beyond `` please uphold schengen and dublin and geneva and the human rights agreements , thanks '' . 
  but i hope they will answer the simple question : fence or corridor , as nobody can expect hungary to keep the 10k people coming in daily , when germany is already getting to its limits ( a rich 80 million country ) and when croatia collapsed with them after a single day . 
  so nobody can expect hungary to keep them , but if they are n't legally let out to austria , then we will have to close the border with croatia . 
  that 's why it 's fence or corridor . 
  how is this low quality ? 
  it documents an important tradition that is not only relevant in hungary but in neighboring countries too . 
  it 's transported unchecked from greece and it 's transported unchecked from croatia . 
  and it 's transported unchecked from austria ( towards germany ) . 
  good luck to the eu for `` trying to create plans '' , that 's really nice and appreciated . 
  in the meantime , what about the people that are coming towards hungary from croatia * right now * ( 8-10 ,000 ** per day ** ) ? 
  fence or corridor to germany ? 
  make up your mind !, 
  because currently the eu is against both . 
  which shows their total incompetence . 
  also what about the border of greece ? 
  if the influx is n't stopped then , you know , it is n't stopped . 
  yeah , so the solution is n't to look for a money exchange booth or a bank that will exchange it , but to throw it away . 
  i see . 
  imagine an american saying : 1 km/h = 0.62 mph , haha , europeans have very slow cars !, 
  the value of one serbian dinar does n't have any bearing on whether you should leave serbian money on the road , unless you can read off that those are 1 dinar banknotes . 
  the hungarian forint has the value of 0.003 usd . 
  does * this * prove that hungarians are poor ? 
  i mean , okay we are poorer than the us , but is it because of the value of 1 forint or 1 dinar ? 
  are cars slower in europe because of the value of 1 km/h when converted to mph ? 
  also the money can be exchanged for euros anywhere in europe . 
  you are not really good at economics , are you ? 
  he 's a hungarian boy . 
  horgos is an ethnically hungarian village in serbia ( 84 % hungarians , 7 % serbs , 5 % gypsies ) . 
  does n't make much difference in the significance of the story , just for correctness . 
  and similar things also happened in budapest where homeless people collected the abandoned blankets and mattresses . 
  they use 0.2 l glasses and a guy is constantly walking around with those and gives the new ones to people . 
  how is that practical ? 
  in bavaria they use ma\u00df , in cologne 0.2 l. . . 
   the flood of syrian refugees not all of them are syrian refugees , come on . 
  by doing what ? 
  yeah , this is the hypocrisy of germany . 
  they keep such unofficial `` elements of uncertainty '' in place at the expense of hungary , croatia and serbia instead of sending the certain military to the greek border to keep them out . 
  but then they could n't claim to be the saviors of the world who are the moral pinnacle of the universe . 
  in what ? 
  so what should hungary do exactly ?
