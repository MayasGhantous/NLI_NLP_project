  if we protect our own border we are shit , but if austria does it , that 's okay . 
  you ca n't just invite people to your country and then say they have to stay at your neighbor 's place . 
  [ video - chaos and protest in front of keleti station ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ac-zezdirm ) he says they have to sleep on the ground ... no , you choose to camp in the area in front of the train station and refuse to go to the refugee camp in bicske , 30 km from budapest . 
  obviously , since all these people came with the plan of going to germany . 
  if they were told they must stay in hungary , they would n't have set their feet on hungarian soil . 
  and now refugees blame hungarian authorities for enforcing the law and blocking their way to germany . 
  if austria closes the border and does n't let trains through and now checks every truck on the m1/a1 motorway , causing hours of waiting time and kilometers upon kilometers of traffic jams , then why are n't we allowed to control our border to serbia ? 
  why is our fence inhumane , but austria wo n't let the trains in ? 
  people ca n't seem to realize this is not about petty internal politics any more . 
  this huge flood of people is a real issue that needs to be solved . 
  pointing fingers at the other political side may be useful when discussing party-politics , but this is not that kind of issue . 
  germans and swedes seem to be okay with lowering their standard of living a bit . 
  maybe two weeks skiing instead of three . 
   must have heard something about germany germans protest with signs saying `` refugees welcome '' , merkel says they take all syrians ` without upper limit ' , 400 euro welfare + rent + food . 
  according to reports , when they arrived to munich they were ecstatic and euphoric ; i think they may expect more than the reality of germany , but it 's hard for them to know as germany really looks like paradise compared to the current situation in syria . 
  they heard all these fairy tale stories so when they arrive to the balkans or hungary they are disappointed . 
  western european media signals to them that the whole europe will receive them with open arms , with lots of free money , house and a great life . 
  and if we do , we get criticized by the media , like in this [ cnn video ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2015/09/01/budapest-train-station-closed-migrants-chant-damon-bpr.cnn ) . 
  if we do n't let them on the train it 's inhumane , if we do , we violate international law . 
  no wonder everyone is confused , even authorities , especially when austria , germany and sweden are all enthusiastic and do this `` refugees welcome '' demonstrations , merkel says there 's ` no limit ' for accepting syrians , etc. 
  in this atmosphere , how are hungarian authorities expected to keep them away from germany ?? 
  if we build a fence we are inhumane , if we give them place in the shitty overcrowded poor camps that we have , it 's inhumane , if we let them board trains , it 's against eu law , if we do n't let them , we are inhumane . 
  fuck this , really . 
  yeah and if we do n't let them on the trains we get criticized in cnn videos with disgusting voiceovers [ like this ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2015/09/01/budapest-train-station-closed-migrants-chant-damon-bpr.cnn ) , saying we are cruel to them for making them stay in the streets around the train station , when in fact they have no intention of going to the refugee camps outside budapest throughout the country , they want to go to welfare germany . 
  we will never be able to provide the same standard of living . 
  there 's no money for it . 
  we have our own poor people . 
  they do n't want to live in eastern europe . 
  you ca n't force them , unless you imprison them or build walls on the borders . 
  they will just go back to germany . 
  we do n't have enough money even for our poor people . 
  there 's no way eastern european societies would accept taking up more problematic people . 
  hungary registers over 90 % of them . 
  even merkel commended this . 
  but some try to escape the registration camps ( where they are not allowed to leave for 24 hours ) , then police have to chase them ( also they are entering all over the border , but if we build a fence to keep track of where they are , we are again bad guys ) , then they do n't go to the voluntary refugee camps ( where they are free to leave ) , instead they camp at the railway station , and demand to be cared for there , instead of the designated camps , thousands want to board trains , police stops them , we get [ warnings from geneva from the international organization of migration ] ( https://news.yahoo.com/ap-interview-migration-group-ready-help-influx-134711443.html ) that blocking their way to the trains just sends them to the arms of smugglers who will put them in inhumane trucks like the one where 71 died in austria , then yesterday we let them board the trains , more than 3000 reached munich , now merkel says germany has no responsibility to accept refugees from hungary , now today we closed the largest railway station , thousands chanting `` un , un '' `` germany , germany '' `` why ? , why ? '', 
  in front of the station . 
  what do you expect us to do ? 
  pull money straight out of our rectum and give them germany-level welfare ? 
  how ? 
  western europe has surplus wealth to host these people , we do n't . 
  merkel is playing a double game . 
  she says [ germany has no responsibility ] ( https://youtu.be/yaqwn0h1cps?t=36m26s ) ( video in german ) about the migrants who entered hungary and are now demanding to be let on the trains . 
  on the other hand she plays the tolerant , welcoming rhetoric , encouraging more and more people to embark on the journey or if they are already on the way then to get more excited . 
  i mean , is it our responsibility then ? 
  we can point to serbia . 
  why are * they * letting the migrants into hungary ? 
  we are just geographically on the way , otherwise we have nothing to do with this whole thing at all . 
  [ video - hungary closes main railway station amid influx of migrants ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/sep/01/hungary-closes-main-train-station-amid-influx-of-migrants-video ), 
  excluding ww1/2 : * fall of communism * revolution of 1956 with ww1/2 : * treaty of trianon * holocaust * german occupation * soviet occupation, 
  clearly you are a greater expert than those who made the official estimate of 800.000 . 
  okay , if we accept your 55 % rejection figure , that means 360 000 people will be let in this year . 
  what about 2016 , 2017 , etc ? 
  you think the problems in the middle east will be suddenly solved ? 
  yeah and if we force the people off the trains [ we get criticized ] ( https://news.yahoo.com/ap-interview-migration-group-ready-help-influx-134711443.html ) , too . 
   geneva ( ap ) -- countries like hungary that have blocked desperate migrants from traveling by train in europe `` push them right into the hands of smugglers , '' with potentially deadly consequences , the head of the international organization for migration said monday . 
   `` if you -- as they have just done in hungary -- if you deny them , although they have a paid ticket and you do n't let them to get on board , you push them right into the hands of smugglers , '' swing said , alluding to the migrants found dead in austria . 
  `` so they get into vans and into trucks and they die . '', 
  hungary closely respects eu law , catching almost all migrants on the southern border ( the fence makes it easier ) , our registration rate is 90 % + , which was also commended by merkel . 
  but then what ? 
  they do n't want to stay !, 
  should we put them in prison ? 
  in order to apply , you have to * get * into germany . 
  then a long long legal process starts while all people must be given accommodation . 
  even if germany denies asylum , the people are there . 
  how do you deport them ? 
  they will go back again , unless you physically close the border . 
  it 's chaos again . 
  keleti railway station was closed by the police and no trains have left for hours at this point . 
  [ thousands of migrants ] ( https://imgur.com/a/qo9sd ) outside the station , chanting `` germany , germany '' . 
  what can we do , really ? 
  [ some screenshots from live tv ] ( https://imgur.com/a/qo9sd ) police closed the station and no trains have left for hours at this point . 
  thousands of people outside , chanting `` germany , germany '' . 
  nobody knows what 's up . 
  they are not `` moved there '' , they camped there unofficially all over the place , filling the underpasses and the whole station . 
  the city administration put up these temporary things where they can stay instead of thousands of people blocking the pedestrian underpasses of the train station . 
  officially , they should leave budapest and go to a refugee camp such as in bicske , 30 km from budapest . 
  but they do n't want to do it as we can see . 
  the mayor said he set these up because he thought they would quickly move on by train instead of camping in these `` transit zones '' . 
  he probably did n't know that they do n't have their registration done yet and the government will not let them board the trains . 
  it 's a lot of legal chaos and nobody really knows what should be done . 
  police did let them through yesterday evening , probably violating international law , but austria accepted the trains , although they stopped some due to overcrowdedness ( you can imagine ) , but i do n't know how that was resolved . 
  the train was also let forward into germany to munich . 
  in hungary the average is around 490 $ . 
  germans know nothing about the situation in the east and assume that we only lack the `` good will '' . 
  no , there 's no money to solve our own problems either . 
  there 's no way people would accept importing more people who need welfare , while the north-east of hungary looks like it does today . 
  they also get it in hungary . 
  there are so called temporary `` transit zones '' in the train station , where there are things [ like this ] ( http://budapestbeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/screen-shot-2015-08-21-at-6.42.39-am-e1440132270598.png ) and of course they get it in the refugee camps as well . 
  this is why the government wants germany to make it clear that they legally allow us to let people through . 
  if we go according to international law and fingerprint them and keep them in hungary , we get things like  countries like hungary that have blocked desperate migrants from traveling by train in europe `` push them right into the hands of smugglers , '' with potentially deadly consequences , the head of the international organization for migration said monday . 
  https://news.yahoo.com/ap-interview-migration-group-ready-help-influx-134711443.html then if we let them through , we are violating the law and are bad guys for pushing the problem further into the eu . 
  there 's no solution here , but to organize ** direct airplane transport from around syria to germany ** . 
  skip all this bullshit in the intermediate countries and the smugglers . 
  i ca n't comment on the austria-czech republic comparison as i do n't know the prices there . 
  but the 10 % difference seems believable . 
  you still have to consider that while groceries may be 10 % more , you make 3 times as much money ( or up to 10x in certain professions ) . 
  and of course prices also vary on a store-by-store basis ( smaller , central ones are more expensive ) and on a city-by-city basis . 
  i have much experience in the prices in western germany ( both around cologne and stuttgart ) and in budapest . 
  germany is really cheap . 
  if you buy store-brand ( e.g.
