  these things are really complicated across times and places . 
  the original , 19th century nationalism was often anti-heredity and made revolutions against monarchies , which is not exactly a pro-order conservative thing . 
  those nationalists wanted to create nation states / assimilate minorities , and included the lower classes in their idea of the nation ( as opposed to the earlier noble-only concept ) . 
  they probably still travel much more than eastern europeans . 
  it 's just the direction of change people are talking about . 
  thanks . 
  all ground meat that not made in front of your eyes is best assumed to be an unknown mix of low quality pieces . 
  this also stands for sausages and wieners/hot dogs . 
  i 'd never expect to get something high-quality when it 's ground meat . 
  in eastern europe it was seen as some sort of magical modern western thing , like a piece of american dream in your life . 
  at the beginning it was definitely not considered cheap ( it still really is n't ) , the cleanliness was much better than we were used to ( i had never ever seen such clean and maintained public toilets , it felt like you 're at a five star hotel ) , the customer experience was like you 're a king . 
  the workers were not confrontative/dismissive/smug , but professional and helpful . 
  the whole thing was just so different , the tastes were new , the foods were new and exotic . 
  the packaging of the burgers , the posters on the wall , the quality and design of the furniture , the fact that workers wore that uniform , everything ... as weird as it must sound now , it was like your country has finally reached some cultural height ... 
  in my childhood ( 90s ) it was a sort of celebration or gift to the kids when we ate at mcdonald 's ( or burger king ) , usually a happy meal with the toy . 
  here it 's really not that cheap for the average earner , so we did n't think of it as the cheap junk it is in the us for example . 
  cooking your own meals is/was cheaper ( and the norm for the middle class at least ) . 
  nowadays we 're totally used to it , so it 's considered the quick crap you get before/after you go drinking and for some reason you ca n't find a kebab place . 
  or a last resort when you have no time and energy to think even a fraction of a second about what to eat . 
  also , our admiration of america did not last too long in that magical form . 
  source please . 
  that was supposed to be [ berlin 's new name ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welthauptstadt_germania ), 
  also in many languages there 's no equivalent of `` the netherlands '' . 
  in hungarian we just have `` hollandia '' and that 's how we call the country in every context , formal or informal . 
  the full official name of the netherlands in hungarian is `` holland kir\u00e1lys\u00e1g '' ( `` dutch kingdom '' ) . 
  `` nagy-britannia '' is a good compromise . 
  * strictly technically * speaking it leaves out northern ireland ( which has about 3 % of the population of the uk ) , but most people do n't know this and they equate `` nagy-britannia '' with the whole thing . 
  ( i think a random poll on the street would show that a large majority of people think northern ireland is part of `` nagy-britannia '' - out of those who know that northern ireland is a thing ) . 
  and if something is in/from/about the england part of the uk , then prefer `` anglia '' . 
  for example if you know someone who went to wash dishes in england , then say that and not uk . 
  same with scotland . 
  for example `` a n\u0151v\u00e9rem sk\u00f3ci\u00e1ban tanul '' ( my sister studies in scotland ) . 
  no need to talk about `` the uk '' here . 
  also , if you 're just speaking colloquially , `` anglia '' or `` angolok '' is good enough . 
  like , `` az angolok lehet , hogy kil\u00e9pnek az uni\u00f3b\u00f3l '' ( the english may quit the [ european ] union ) . 
  but if you 're writing some serious political essay , use `` egyes\u00fclt kir\u00e1lys\u00e1g '' when appropriate . 
  nope , we never use such abbreviations ( not even rarely ) . 
  if we want to use an abbreviation then we leave it at uk or gb ( just as we leave usa as such and do n't translate it to ae\u00c1 ) . 
  but in speech , we 'd have to say `` uk '' with english pronunciation ( i never heard it as `` oo-kah '' , just `` you-kay '' , even in hungarian ) , so it would sound a bit `` snobbish '' . 
  in everyday speech we just say england for the whole thing , or if it 's relevant then scotland/wales/northern ireland as appropriate . 
  the equivalent of `` united kingdom '' ( egyes\u00fclt kir\u00e1lys\u00e1g ) is rarely used in normal speech in hungarian . 
  i 'd wager that many people who do n't speak english would n't even know what country that is . 
  the equivalents of `` great britain '' ( nagy-britannia ) and `` england '' ( anglia ) are much better known and used . 
  people do n't like change , any change . 
  and when they do , they mostly just remain silent and go on with their day . 
  only those are loud who are against it . 
  okay , everyone 's feelings work differently . 
  you might want to toughen up a bit though , this world can be nasty sometimes . 
  yep . 
  these comparisons are really disgusting propaganda spread by copyright holders . 
  `` piracy '' is a bad word too , but it 's less of a problem because people associate to kids ' cartoon pirates and not to the real criminals . 
  it 's not too smart to base your opinion of a whole city/country on a bunch of random guys ... 
  i 'm pretty sure nothing happens to a parked car with romanian plates in budapest . 
  uk libel law is pretty crap , though . 
  take for example the simon singh vs. chiropractics case ( [ just one discussion i found quickly on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goufrdk9ys0 ) ), 
   it does say `` magyar orzag '' ( note the fact that it 's two words - maybe at this point it was a normal adjectival construction ? ), 
  i think it 's just a different way to spell it . 
  not all languages like compound words even today , and hungarian could have been standardized the same way . 
  see for example `` czech republic '' which is also two words , but it 's a well-defined country . 
  it 's just convention . 
  and n\u00e9metorsz\u00e1g refers to the holy roman empire , also a well defined entity ( matthias tried to become holy roman emperor , colloquially referred to as `` n\u00e9met cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r '' , short for `` n\u00e9met-r\u00f3mai cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r '' ), 
  you 're talking about several different things here . 
  the latin word is hungaria , the hungarian word is magyarorsz\u00e1g , since a very long time . 
  look at this poem from around 1490 , `` a m\u00e1ty\u00e1s kir\u00e1ly hal\u00e1l\u00e1ra val\u00f3 eml\u00e9kdal '' from [ page 267 of this pdf ] ( http://mek.oszk.hu/07000/07021/07021.pdf ) ( the word itself is on the next page ) . 
  or take a look at the \u00c9rdy-codex in the same pdf . 
  `` magyarorsz\u00e1g '' ( sometimes with not-yet-standardized spelling ) was the default name of hungary in the hungarian language . 
  obviously it could n't have been the official name , since latin was the official language of the country , so the latin name was the official name . 
  but this seems pretty obvious . 
   and after that they claimed that since 1000 this ` magyarorsz\u00e1g ' was a nationstate ( fyi , i 'm not saying that it wasnt hungarians who lived there or anything , just that it wasnt a nationstate , it was just a feudal state like any other ) yeah , this is another issue . 
  nations as we know them today were invented in the `` national awakening '' period . 
  but this is not in contradiction with the fact that `` magyarorsz\u00e1g '' has been the equivalent of latin hungaria as far back in time as we have hungarian-language texts . 
  hungarian became co-official in 1836 and the only official language in 1844 . 
  do you think they did n't use `` magyarorsz\u00e1g '' in those times ? 
   to me it seems that it only became popular during the nationalism period this is not true . 
  there are not many hungarian language texts from the early times , but there are some and i spent some time to find digitized versions of them . 
  for one , zr\u00ednyi 's `` az t\u00f6r\u00f6k \u00e1fium ellen val\u00f3 orvoss\u00e1g '' ( 1661 ) routinely says `` magyarorsz\u00e1g '' , while the `` szent margit legenda '' ( 1510 ) contains `` magerorzag '' several times [ pdf ] ( http://nyelvemlekek.oszk.hu/sites/nyelvemlekek.oszk.hu/files/margit.pdf ) ( i have n't read the whole thing obviously and it is n't ocr-ed but a website had a digitized quotation with page number , anyway , on ( pencil-marked ) page 186 in the 7th line you can find it , and also on page 179 and probably many other places that i did n't bother reading through ) . 
  i could go dig up some more codex pdfs but i think this shows that the `` magyarorsz\u00e1g '' is pretty old . 
  i do n't know why you thought otherwise . 
  but it 's true that hungarian only became official in the national awakening period . 
  edit : [ here is a concordance ( word-indexed ) version of the margit legend ] ( http://deba.unideb.hu/deba/margit-legenda_szent_margit_elete_1510/concord.html ) , it contains `` magerorzagban '' twice , `` magerorzagnak '' twice and `` magyarorzagbel\u00ff '' once , and no word beginning with `` hun ... '' at all . 
   hungary as ` magyarorsz\u00e1g ' is also like that what do you mean ? 
  i 'm pretty sure it was called `` magyarorsz\u00e1g '' in those times too - up to spelling differences ( like magyar-orsz\u00e1g , magyar orzagh , etc ) . 
  shocking as it may seem , you * can * decide not to go shopping and relax instead , even if they are open . 
  the supermarket chains say their revenue did not decrease , there was even some increase . 
  people got used to it and shopped on other days . 
  it also did n't make too many people shop at small family-owned stores , which was a declared goal . 
  rather , people just bought more stuff at once in the multinational hyper/supermarket chains . 
  [ info in hungarian about the effects ] ( http://index.hu/gazdasag/2016/04/07/vasarnapi_boltzar_egy_eve_nepszavazas/ ), 
  context : last year the parliament introduced this , on the proposal of co-governing kdnp ( christian democratic people 's party ) , a microscopic party saying that people should be able to spend the sunday with their families , so shop workers should n't need to work ( with certain exceptions ) . 
  people did n't like this . 
  you can do many things in hungary , you can be corrupt , you can do almost anything that does n't interfere with people 's everyday lives . 
  but if you interfere with their everyday lives , they get irritated . 
  each sunday made people remember that they ca n't go shopping because of the government . 
  of course the opposition jumped on the opportunity . 
  they 've been trying to initiate a referendum for more than a year now , but the government always used loopholes in the law to delay it . 
  now the supreme court decided that the referendum question submitted by the socialists has to be approved . 
  a few days later , governing fidesz party backed down , and they say they accept that they could n't convince the people about the advantages and to avoid having to spend a lot of money to organize a referendum , they rather revert the law . 
  the referendum would have been a symbolic anti-government protest voting , so they were afraid with a reason . 
  bullshit , there are protests quite often . 
  not in this particular topic , but in general , internet tax , teachers , nurses sometimes , tons of protests against the prev government etc.
