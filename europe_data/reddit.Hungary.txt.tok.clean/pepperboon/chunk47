  8 hour workday ) and i was usually among the last few kids left . 
  when i was in kindergarten i was among the first to arrive ( around 7:30 ) , when only the janitors were there . 
  so somehow the other kids ' parents worked even less than that . 
  it 's not about the people and i think not even about the country . 
  rather about the panama channel construction . 
  if the channel had another name , perhaps we 'd use that . 
  in hungarian it 's also a verb : panam\u00e1zik = to do illegal business , to steal money by corruption etc. 
  i thought this is a common expression in all major languages . 
  hungary is cool with it . 
  if you 're above 18 , the other needs to be at least 14 . 
  and two 12-18 year olds are also allowed ( so 12 and 17 are legal ) . 
  ( of course only if consensual and no power or authority relation etc. ), 
  ( also , children below 14 are not punishable for sexual crimes ), 
  in the non-sung part our anthem mentions not only a sea of blood , but also heaps of bones , seas of flames , torturous slavery , death groans and all this sort of stuff . 
  like  castle stood , now a heap of stones happiness and joy fluttered , groans of death , weeping now sound in their place . 
  and ah !, 
  freedom does not bloom from the blood of the dead , torturous slavery 's tears fall from the burning eyes of the orphans !, 
   pity , o lord , the hungarians who are tossed by waves of danger extend over it your guarding arm on the sea of its misery long torn by ill fate bring upon it a time of relief they who have suffered for all sins of the past and of the future !, 
  yeah , we have n't had a successful history in the last few hundred years . 
  but you claimed that slovakia is now friendly to hungarians in general . 
  and that it was all 5 years ago and just by a few politicians . 
  i gave you examples of not just a few politicians , but normal people stealing signs , the railway company not putting up signs , stores not putting up signs , the government denying the will of the people in a village to retake the original name of it . 
  so it 's not just one or two politicians . 
  i 'm not saying that these things are n't legal according to slovak law . 
  the practice is that the signs are not there . 
  do n't tell me that it 's always stolen by some slovaks . 
  then they should be replaced . 
  also , the train station signs are missing . 
  afaik because of the slovak national railway company . 
  there was a [ petition ] ( https://www.fuen.org/de/news/einzelansicht/article/lorant-vincze-minority-protection-has-reached-stagnation-on-both-levels-domestic-and-european/ ) to the european parliament recently , to help hungarians with this . 
  also , many chain stores and other `` consumer places '' are slovak only . 
  there are no hungarian signs . 
  this is a responsibility of the companies , of course . 
  so it 's individuals , it 's companies , it 's the railway , it 's the state etc. 
  also , in 2012 pered ( renamed te\u0161ed\u00edkovo in 1948 ) voted at a referendum to officially get back their old name . 
  this referendum is ignored by the government . 
  there were tons of such renamings against the will of the local population in 1948 , taking the old name of villages and towns and renaming them to artificial new names based on slovak writers and public figures who had nothing to do with the particular village . 
  and do n't get me started on how the benes decrees are still actively part of slovak law , declaring hungarians collectively guilty , reaffirmed in 2007 by the slovak parliament . 
  during and after the ottoman wars , the habsburgs simply took control over the weakened hungary . 
  then much later , after multiple revolutions and attempts of getting independent as hungary , we made a `` compromise '' and formed austria-hungary . 
  but hungarians were n't really enthusiastic about it . 
  those decades did turn out quite nicely though , in terms of development , but it was n't really about `` spooning '' . 
  but we still jokingly refer to austrians as the `` brothers-in-law '' . 
  there is still a big lack of hungarian signs , even in towns populated largely by hungarians . 
  for example at railway stations . 
  last year , activists had to put up the hungarian `` dunaszerdahely '' sign ( [ source ] ( http://www.ketnyelvu.info/2015/04/16/zsr-versus-kdsz-20151 ) ) , even though 75 % of the population of the town is hungarian . 
  needless to say , the sign was promptly removed again . 
  another [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zw6wt8gchi ) by this movement . 
  why did you put lost lands in quotes ? 
  they were lost . 
  it 's also not a fairy tale that there were areas with over 80-90 % that were lost . 
  i 'm not saying that we should try to get them back because it 's totally unrealistic . 
  yeah , some languages have that but many do n't . 
  and actually spanish \u00f1 is more like the long nny in hungarian . 
  the short ny is as short as any other short consonant . 
  edit : i just realized you probably meant catalan and `` catalunya '' . 
  i do n't know much about the catalan ny , but i assume it 's similar to the spanish \u00f1 . 
  most people just watch the news , maybe discuss it with colleagues at lunchbreak and that 's it . 
  it 's a minority who expresses any opinion about it online . 
  but if you go on twitter and facebook of course that 's what you 'll see . 
  twitter is absolute shit in every topic . 
  how could you discuss complex political and social issues in such short texts and a few hashtags ? 
  it completely dumbs down and polarizes everything and makes it into a sort of disney story . 
  but again , most people do n't give a shit about twitter . 
  in fact , even twitter-bashing is old now . 
  it 's just lazy journalists who think it 's relevant what hashtag or meme is `` trending '' on twitter . 
  do you also require this from the riches who go to ski in the swiss alps ? 
  many people travel for the status effect . 
  i 'm not convinced that this is more frequent in the suzuki + fried chicken people . 
   the cross is attached to the crown in a rough manner , rising from the midriff of christ in the central enamel plaque at the top of the crown . 
  this addition might have taken place during the 16th century . 
  the cross was knocked crooked in the 17th century when the crown was damaged , possibly by the top of the iron chest housing the insignia being hastily closed without the crown having been placed in it properly . 
  the cross has since been left in this slanted position , and is now always depicted as such . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holy_crown_of_hungary#cross ) some say that this whole ( quite absurd ) ordeal sums up the essence of being hungarian quite well ... 
   there is even a certain stereotype of the hungarian lower-middle class family vacationing on the adria , driving a suzuki ignis , packing canned food and homemade fried chicken because restaurant food is expensive , their only expense being the apartment rent . 
  ( this is actually rare to do it this way but the idea is to ridicule people who want to look like a high status by telling people they vacationed abroad and yet they can not actually really afford it . ), 
  been there , done that with my family as a kid . 
  with a suzuki swift . 
  it was the first time we vacationed abroad . 
  before that , we could only afford the cheap , company-sponsored apartments at the balaton and cooking our own meals . 
  you can call these people names , but for many it 's a big thing . 
  and not all just want to look like high-status people . 
  perhaps they just want to see ( and let their kids see ) something other than hungary , see something `` exotic '' , like the sea , palm trees , hear people speak a different language in the streets , etc. 
  people who ca n't afford foreign vacations or restaurants are n't automatically ` dumb peasants ' who ca n't appreciate stuff . 
  for example , we really prepared for the journey , read guidebooks and maps of where to go , what to see etc. 
  i looked up croatian words and stuff on the internet weeks before and so on . 
  but yeah , we made sandwiches for the day trips because we could n't afford to jump in a restaurant on a whim . 
  i really do n't like this attitude that you can either afford to pay for a hotel and eat out every day or otherwise you should just stay at home in your commieblock and watch some soap opera ... 
  the hungarian name is `` l\u00f3r\u00e1nt '' . 
  surprisingly , it has nothing to do with laurent , rather it 's one of the hungarian variants of `` roland '' ( throught switching the r and l ) . 
  no , we have no partitive case . 
  there are various ways to express the same thing . 
  for example some variations on `` he eats bread '' can be the following . 
  ( note that `` eszik '' means `` eat '' and `` keny\u00e9r '' means `` bread '' ) * megeszi a kenyeret . 
  - * he eats the ( whole ) bread . 
  * - here we use the prefixed version `` megeszik '' . 
  prefixes on verbs express certain directions or aspects . 
  the `` meg '' prefix can mean various things , like suddenness or the final aspect or other slight flavors that are hard to describe . 
  - * he eats/is eating ( some ) bread . 
  * - just in general he eats/is eating this stuff now .
