  we do n't know/aren ' t interested how much of it . 
  no article in this sentence and the verb is in indefinite conjugation . 
  - * he eats/is eating the bread . 
  * '' - he eats a specific loaf/slice/piece of bread but we do n't know if he eats the whole thing . 
  `` a '' is `` the '' and the verb is in definite conjugation . 
  - * he eats/is eating from the bread . 
  * - literally `` from the bread '' , so it means that only a part gets eaten . 
  in school we learned that this `` from x '' in this sense is called a `` partit\u00edvuszi hat\u00e1roz\u00f3 '' = `` partitive determiner/describer in adverbial role '' . 
  it was in small print in grammar books and i think nowadays they do n't even teach this anymore . 
  we use the verb prefixes , articles , definitie/indefinite conjugation , word order and the suffix meaning `` from '' etc to express these sorts of things and whether something is continuous or perfect , since we have no explicit continuous or perfect tenses , only generic past , present and future . 
  the grammar is quite similar to english to be honest . 
  both are germanic languages , it 's just that english also has a lot of french/latin vocabulary . 
  yeah conjugation and adjective declination need some memorizations , but it 's not really too hard . 
  there are also some irregularities , like the irregular past forms , but there is some system to that too . 
  pronunciation is also not too extreme , i only have issues with the throat-r . 
  yes , definitely . 
  for example when i 'm abroad , people sometimes try to `` impress '' me by saying something ( word or expression ) in hungarian and i just have no idea what they are trying to say . 
  one thing that 's very important in hungarian pronunciation is vowel and consonant length . 
  and that length is totally independent from stressed syllables ( stress is always on the first syllable ) . 
  this is very unusual for english speakers who put the rhythm and tune of english over hungarian and it makes it basically impossible for us to understand because it 's just such an important part of the language . 
  edit : another factor is that while broken english grammar may seem funny or weird , really broken hungarian grammar destroys the whole grammatical structure of the sentence and it loses the meaning . 
  english is pretty good because beginners can already start forming useful sentences and even if they make some grammatical mistake it will be understood . 
  by contrast the beginner phase in hungarian is much longer , you need to learn a lot of grammar rules , suffixes , vowel harmony etc. 
  english , by comparison , seems just like `` throwing words one after the other '' . 
  the cat eats the mouse . 
  for this you need to understand the accusative case ( - t ) , vowel harmony ( why it 's - et for eg\u00e9r and why it loses it 's accent mark ) , the conjugation of `` eszik '' , why it 's definite conjugation , the meg - prefix ( showing the ` final ' aspect of eating the whole thing ) etc. 
  it 's very hard to construct useful sentences without getting deep into grammar rules . 
  in english it 's more like lego . 
  for this particular sentence one only needs to understand the - s in eats . 
  just a few difficult things : 1 ) pronunciation we have a few vowels ( a , \u00f6 , \u00fc ) and consonants ( gy , ny , ty , zs ) that are somewhat difficult , depending on your native language . 
  stress is always on the first syllable of every word , which sounds simple , but many foreigners still `` sing '' like in their own language and put the stress at other places that feel more natural to them . 
  2 ) vowel harmony and linking vowels you need to choose the right version of suffixes depending on the vowels in a word and what consonants the word ends in ( if any ) . 
  3 ) definite/indefinite conjugation basically , if there 's a definite object in the sentence ( even if just implied but omitted ) , then you use definite conjugation , otherwise indefinite . 
  one example of definite objects is ones markd with a definite article ( like ` the ' ) . 
  = i see . 
  = i see it . 
  seems simple but there are exceptions and complications . 
  certain personal pronouns are considered indefinite , `` everything '' ( `` minden '' ) is indefinite , but `` all '' ( `` mind '' ) is definite etc. 
  4 ) choosing a natural-sounding word order hungarian is often said to have free word order , but that 's not really true . 
  it 's a myth that sometimes even believed by hungarians , although it 's obvious when foreigners use a wrong word order . 
  hungarian word order expresses intention , emphasis and context in ways that are perhaps strange for english-speakers . 
  or [ english ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_ ( surname \\ ) ) or [ deutsch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsch_ ( surname \\ ) ) . 
  but it 's true that magyar is a lot more frequent than those . 
  `` curse '' means both `` k\u00e1romkod\u00e1s '' and '' \u00e1tok '' . 
  it rather means the first here , i.e. 
  swearing , and not bringing supernatural bad stuff on someone . 
   i believe that our upper middle class lives around the same as `` the western '' middle class . 
  this is important . 
  what western europe would call upper-middle , we 'd call rich and upper . 
  what they 'd call upper is basically beyond the imagination of the average hungarian ( who daydreams of 675 $ / month and imagines it to be `` very good life '' ) . 
   ah , what a great defence . 
  it 's always happened . 
  it 's always been going on . 
  so why stop ? 
  by that logic why do n't we condone slavery in third world countries ? 
  that 's existed since time immemorial . 
  it was once what drove the great economies of the world . 
  i 'm not defending anything . 
  it 's not my invention , i 'm just stating observations about it . 
  on a smaller scale , we in hungary and other eastern european countries get paid a lot less for the same job ( like a lidl cashier job ) compared to western europe . 
  ( much less , even if price differences are factored in . ), 
  am i happy about this that hungarians can barely make ends meet on the money they get from tesco or lidl ? 
  it 's bad but still better than having no jobs around . 
  and yes it still makes me angry and feel that it 's an injustice . 
  `` it 's always been going on '' means that it 's not capitalism that causes it . 
  it 's the normal way of human life . 
  the miracle is what we have in the west ( for at least middle-class people ) . 
   child labour probably is the least worst option for poor children in bangladesh . 
  but what does that say about capitalism ? 
  i do n't know . 
  again , i do n't * like * that this is the case . 
  but i can not foresee western people giving up their clothes and their electronics and all their plastic mass produced stuff . 
  people could n't buy as many clothes , so many workers would get fired . 
  they 'd perhaps work illegally . 
  capitalism gives them some jobs that are better than the alternative ( like farming ) . 
  if capitalism moves out of bangladesh , will it be better ? 
  the only way i can interpret your words is that you 'd like massive and consistent wealth transfer from the west to the third world . 
  but who will vote for such policy ? 
  things do n't happen just because `` it would be so nice and heart warming '' . 
  on this half of europe we 've witnessed decades of a thing that called itself socialism , allegedly on the way to communism where everyone is equal and the working class rules . 
  we 've seen what it looks like in reality . 
  yeah , i know , `` we just have to get it right this time '' ... 
  it 's not a great advertisement for reality . 
  children used to work since time immemorial . 
  today 's western way of life is such an unprecedented luxury compared to other times and places that it 's hard to even make sense of . 
  since you emphasized `` capitalism '' , do you think communism would help ? 
  or do you propose that we magically switch to a utopia and magically change human nature from one day to the other and `` why are there wars , why ca n't we just get along '' and sing and dance together as a 13-year-old imagines ? 
  even all if western consumers suddenly all turned into hippies who 'd rather walk around in rags than wear stuff produced in sweatshops , the extra money would first have to fill up the pockets of the medium-poor people there . 
  you ca n't just magically make the sweatshops become like uk factories . 
  their whole economy has to improve . 
  [ more on child labour and how it 's better than the alternative ] ( http://www.cato.org/publications/economic-development-bulletin/case-against-child-labor-prohibitions ), 
  the fertility rate in bangladesh is 2.2 births/woman . 
  they are n't `` breeding like rabbits '' anymore . 
  and they did n't `` breed '' earlier because of malice or something . 
  there are many factors . 
  for example having children means having someone care for you when you 're old ( no state pension existed ) . 
  also , contraceptives were not available ( it 's not cheap and people were n't educated to use it ) . 
  their traditional birth rate was `` calibrated '' to much worse health conditions where kids died all the time . 
  as the conditions got better , they did n't die all the time and survived to adulthood . 
  but in any case , bangladesh is a bad example because there is no population explosion there any more .
