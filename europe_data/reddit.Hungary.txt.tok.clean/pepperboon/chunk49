  now it 's `` german voters ' crushing verdict '' . 
  if you look at [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/europe_polar_stereographic_caucasus_urals_boundary.svg/2000px-europe_polar_stereographic_caucasus_urals_boundary.svg.png ) , european russia is definitely smaller than the rest of europe . 
  it seems sensible enough to add ukraine and belarus to `` eastern europe '' . 
  but of course you could argue that those should be central as well ... 
  but orthodox christianity is one reason that 's often used to qualify them as eastern . 
  yeah , the baltic countries are an anomaly in this map . 
  i consider them their own category . 
   `` eastern europe '' is n't a zing , but rather a geographical location . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's a `` zing '' . 
  just look at [ that scene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1myqy5yeld0 ) from eurotrip . 
  yeah , * obviously * it 's a joke and a play on the stereotypes , but it 's a play on real stereotypes . 
  americans usually think of `` eastern europe '' as this dirty , crumbling , underdeveloped , shady and gray place , where they need to be careful not to get robbed at every corner etc. 
  it 's still an exotic region , mostly outside the view of american tourists who much more often go to uk , france , italy , than to what they call `` eastern europe '' . 
   europeans cross national borders a lot depends on where and who . 
  many europeans do n't cross borders more than once a year for a vacation or not even that . 
  on the other hand you have people who work across the border and cross every day . 
  but that 's a minority , mostly around the benelux states . 
   i guess that the best-off countries in europe tended to get visa-free travel easily , so not having visa-free status is , in europe , i guess kind of like saying that someone is better than someone else . 
  that 's not surprising . 
  giving visa-free travel is a way of saying `` you 're okay by default '' . 
  requiring visa is saying `` you 're suspicious by default '' . 
  it 's kinda offensive to assume that people from some country are suspicious . 
  the ( not really new ) term is '' [ central europe ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/grossgliederung_europas-en.svg ) '' as i said . 
  also i meant that one looks like a typical american when calling us that . 
  i targeted this at fellow europeans , like `` be more aware than those folks across the pond '' . 
  i * do * understand that for faraway americans who do n't know much about the region , the poor east vs. rich west is a reasonable grouping . 
   i also have the impression that the corruption is much higher , at least when compared to northern european countries . 
  it 's true , but perhaps not the way that people imagine from far away . 
  it 's not on an everyday open level , where you have to bribe policemen or bureaucrats at offices for normal things . 
  it 's mostly on a higher , political level . 
  but yeah , the division is still there . 
  generations of communist rule changes the way people think . 
  you can still see the internal division inside germany between east and west . 
  even as western germany has been sending large amounts of money to develop eastern germany for the last 26 years . 
  most people who watch the news once in a while have heard or read about trump . 
  but it stays at the `` recognizes the name '' - level . 
  yeah , we like `` central europe '' . 
  that 's what we use ourselves ( in hungarian , in school , on tv etc ) and it seems like `` arrogant ignorant american '' - speak when someone says eastern europe for hungary . 
  but after reading it so many times on the internet now , i do n't care too much . 
  we mostly like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/grossgliederung_europas-en.svg ) grouping . 
  it 's mostly because we want to get rid of the pre-1990 ideas of the underdeveloped eastern bloc ( and yugoslavia ) vs. rich west . 
  but actually the wealth difference is still very big . 
  but still `` eastern europe '' paints a mental picture of extreme poverty ( starving donkeys pulling carriages in the mud ) and dangerous mafia and whatever . 
  when actually our cities look pretty nice , people manage to make a living ( even if not at a canadian quality of life ) etc. 
  standard practice all over reddit . 
  quite a bitter and angry place it is . 
  when farmers tried to protest with tractors in budapest 10 years ago , the mayor put [ these ] ( http://index.hu/cikkepek/0610/belfold/traktor2.jpg ) signs all over budapest ... no , i 'm not even joking . 
  27 % in hungary . 
   poland for the first two , but i would mind joining them . 
  [ torgy\u00e1n disagrees ] ( https://youtu.be/m_rc1qkcami?t=7m2s ) ( he wants a joint federalised hungarian-polish united state , with a corridor connecting us by buying transcarpathia ), 
  which is funny , because in hungary it 's the exact reverse . 
  towns are competing and lobbying to get the prison built there and rejoice when they win it , because it brings lots of jobs to local people ( all sorts of administrative jobs , cleaning , repairs , transport , canteen etc. ) . 
  and prisons just raise the safety of the people because it means more authorities in the neighborhood and prisons are extremely well guarded , it 's irrational to fear that a prisoner will escape and then attack you . 
  even if they escape they 'd be crazy to stay in the neighborhood instead of getting away as fast as possible . 
  tldr ; hungarians want prisons near them, 
  their mental model of the situation is that there is a cycle of racism -  difficulty in integration -  migrants forced to turn to criminality/isolation -  racism -  ... and they want to break this cycle with slowing down the `` migrants forced to turn to criminality/isolation -  racism '' link , so migrants do n't face as much prejudice and can integrate easier . 
  there is sense in this , but the problems probably go a lot deeper than this . 
  this narrative does n't ascribe agency to the migrants , as if they had no say in whether they want to integrate . 
  in many cases they have no such wish . 
  the western , swedish , left-liberal way of life is not desirable for everyone on the planet . 
  they are not some default morals that everyone secretly wishes to follow and think of as a `` breath of fresh air '' after living in the middle east as westerners often believe ( the general quality of life * is * , but you can have that while keeping your old way of thinking ) . 
  another thing they might fear is that people often ca n't distinguish between `` probability that a person is a migrant if they are a criminal '' vs. `` probability that a person is a criminal if they are a migrant '' . 
  just because many are migrants among the criminals , does n't mean that a random migrant is likely to be criminal ( more likely than a native , yes , but still not ` likely ' ) . 
  the police and others thinking in this `` enlightened absolutism '' way believe that people ca n't interpret statistics correctly so just like you do n't give knives into children 's hands , they see this data as too prone to misinterpretation by ordinary folks . 
  i do n't agree with this . 
  when you start withholding facts because you fear that the population is not mature enough to deal with reality , you start going down the authoritarian path where you feel the need to filter and censor and pre-chew all information before throwing it to the peasants . 
  actually , this is an english grammatical structure , where `` in case '' means the same as `` lest '' , or `` as a means to avoid that '' . 
  it does n't mean `` if '' in this sentence . 
  i 'm not sarcastic , this is a thing in english . 
   the eu treaties do , however , say that council decisions are binding , and as of 2017 will be passed exclusively by a qualified majority vote . 
  are you telling me hungary is going to accept the decisions made that way ? 
  hungary ( along with slovakia ) has filed a lawsuit against that decision at the ecj ( about the redistribution of 120,000 people ) . 
  i 'm not a lawyer so i ca n't predict the result . 
   the point is that eu depends on contributions , and if you outright refuse to contribute on equal terms with the other states under whatever circumstances , then you should either evaluate your own membership in the union or it will eventually be evaluated for you . 
  as i heard , the hungarian government is ready to pay a certain amount of money for being able to opt out of migrant quotas . 
  how much , i do n't know . 
  it has to be negotiated . 
  i know this reasoning . 
  western eu likes to make it seem like they are tossing some money at us because they are good and so they can demand stuff when they see fit . 
  actually , the eu is about treaties and agreements in common interest . 
  we opened up our markets and multinational companies are shoveling out their profits from hungary , while paying a fraction of the wage they pay for the equivalent employees in western europe . 
  the eu has also forced many industries out of business with artificial motivations ( paying farmers to stop producing ) . 
  it 's incredibly naive to see the eu monies as some sort of charity . 
  it is n't . 
  i 'm not saying that it 's all bad for us , i 'm only saying that it 's not bad for western eu and they took us in because it was their interest as well . 
  treaties are made when interests align . 
  so let 's just stick to the treaties that we 've signed . 
  the eu treaties do n't say anything about forcing members to take in migrants from all over the world . 
  if the treaties had contained that condition , then maybe hungarian people would n't have voted for the eu membership at the referendum in 2003 . 
   they 're not really dealing with the bulk of the problem , western europe is mostly . 
  except if there will be mandatory quotas . 
  and this is the precise reason for vetoing/blocking such agreements that include mandatory quotas for each eu member . 
  hungary does n't care if western europe wants to take in migrants and has no intention to block any agreement which says that western europe shares the migrants among themselves , voluntarily . 
  low-cost airlines ( ryanair and wizzair ) check it . 
  low-cost airlines check it . 
  when i fly from budapest to charleroi or other places nearby with ryanair or wizzair , they always check it . 
  i can of course use my id card instead of a passport , but there is a check every time ( out of the 10 or so times i 've done it ) . 
  portuguese , but more the brazilian variety .

  which are anti-hungarian nowadays out of those who got in ?
