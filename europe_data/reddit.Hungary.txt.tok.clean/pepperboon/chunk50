  i guess mainly the sns ( perhaps kotleba too , somewhat ? 
  this is the `` things are not black or white , everything is gray therefore everything is the same 50 % gray '' logic . 
  we * should * and have to differentiate between the crimes and injustice that different people/nations/leaders caused or suffered . 
  otherwise , why care about what people do now ? 
  tomorrow they can just say , `` oh nobody 's perfect '' and that we should just forget about it since everyone commits crimes . 
  also , medieval and early modern hospitals were bullshit ( also did n't exist much ) . 
  useful medicine did n't start until the 19th century . 
  okay , thanks . 
  i guess i 'm mostly influenced by american english then . 
  to me it sounds like `` i eat not meat '' in the sense of `` i do n't eat meat '' or `` i like not it '' instead of `` i do n't like it '' . 
  good quality free internet resources are a quite recent thing . 
  and even finding them requires a knowledge of english . 
  i think your basic understanding of `` what the internet is like '' and `` what 's out there '' in general , comes from reading english-language news , like tech news , etc. 
  and it 's not so fast for someone who does n't know english . 
  i also think that autodidactic learning is n't for everyone . 
  i mean , if you really wanted , nowadays you could learn everything . 
  even advanced quantum mechanics for free , by learning from online courses , pirating textbooks , downloading research papers , asking questions at stackexchange or discussion forums etc. 
  but still , not many people do this . 
  structured learning helps , and it 's not a deficiency or a sign of moral corruption if you are n't good at learning without external pushes . 
  i guess you mean learning through english , right ? 
  i do n't think you could learn japanese this way if you only knew norwegian . 
  so how is this helpful for someone who only speaks hungarian ? 
   especially on reddit and social media this made me think a bit . 
  i wanted to say that people do the same offline , but then i realized there 's a difference . 
  basically , online you can always find a bunch of people who will agree with you on a particular point . 
  to discuss your beliefs on topic x , you can go to the subreddit/discussion forum/blog/facebook page etc. 
  and feel good about your opinion . 
  for topic y , you can again go to the respective place online , but there is n't necessarily an overlap between the people with whom you discuss topics x and y. 
  and you can have many such topics where you slowly gravitate towards groups that agree with you and you can simply ignore those who disagree and never return to their turf . 
  in real life , you do n't have as many connections , so necessarily you 'll discuss your opinions on different issues with highly overlapping groups of people . 
  obviously you do n't discuss work or the newest advances in your professional with anyone outside it , and you discuss your favorite football team with other football fans , but there is still a lot of overlap . 
  at least a bit of tangential topics come up when you have a regular human connection to someone ( unless it 's a really formal connection ) . 
  so necessarily , sometimes you will meet disagreement from people that you ca n't just write off as dumbasses as you would do on the internet , because you have a meaningful connection to them already . 
  so you will try to investigate why that person thinks differently from you , you will be a bit more receptive to new ideas . 
  but with online people who are just a random username on reddit , we have no previous `` cred '' , we can easily brush them off as people of `` the other side '' , malicious people with an agenda or simply as stupid people . 
  this is quite worrying to be honest . 
  there 's value in having a local , physical community where people know and trust each other and which isn explicitly based around some particular opinion or idea . 
  not sure what you mean . 
  internet resources are n't always very good . 
  do you mean learning exclusively from youtube/duolingo and movies etc ? 
  i think it 's still useful to buy course books , dictionaries , grammar summaries , novels ... online hungarian-german ( / italian etc. ), 
  dictionaries are n't really that good . 
  you may also want to buy a simple novel or something . 
  like penguin books . 
  sure you can go the frugal way , but being able to afford tools helps a lot . 
  people also often prefer to go to a physical class in person and learn with others ( for increased commitment , habit formation , sustained motivation ) , or take classes from a private tutor ( they cost about 10-15 $ / hour ) . 
  maybe for norwegians these things cost pocket change , but for many people it is a significant cost . 
  as a non-native i know it as either `` i have n't got time '' , `` i do n't have time '' , `` i have ( got ) no time '' . 
  `` i have n't time '' seems unusual , `` have n't '' is usually part of a present perfect construct , not possession . 
  but apparently in some dialects it 's fine . 
  a `` logical '' explanation ( although language does n't have to be logical , whatever it means ) would be that if you expand it , you get `` i have not time '' , which is definitely not grammatical . 
  yeah it seems like we ca n't accept that they are just simply poor as fuck and there is no god who would compensate them for it with some spiritual rewards . 
   how much they would love to move to the country and own chickens because i come from a rural area interesting that this basically does n't exist in hungary . 
  i mean due to the shared culture , some people long for the simple life , but urban middle class people never long for living in the hungarian countryside . 
  i think they have a more realistic image of it . 
  but you ca n't really compare a german and a hungarian village . 
  interestingly , we have dutch and other western european pensioners who move to certain hungarian villages to live their idyllic years . 
  there were tv reports about such villages . 
  they usually have a hard time communicating or understanding each other with the neighbors . 
  the hungarian rural people think they are naive spoiled people who `` have so much money , they do n't know what to do with it '' - as one of the neighbors said when asked about how nice the dutch garden is . 
  ( i 'm not criticizing nice gardens , just pointing out some vast differences in perception ) . 
  i think the analogous thing for hungarian right-wingers is rather the fetishization of hungarians living outside hungary , for example the sz\u00e9kely , like * they * are still uncorrupted and proper hungarians who keep the real dialects , the real culture etc. 
  again , this need for imagined compensation . 
  they 've been facing certain challenges as a minority , so they `` must '' have some spiritual compensation . 
  similarly , whether it 's scientifically true or not ( perhaps it somewhat is ) , we like the idea that blind people get better hearing . 
  or anytime someone from eastern europe mentions their salary here , western european jump on it to point out the price difference ( which is true , but not nearly to the extent of the salary difference - but it puts their minds at ease ) . 
  this is also the origin of many religious ideas . 
  the respect for suffering , the rewards in heaven for those who are poor in this life , how sacrifice leads to rewards , like the whole idea of christianity , that * through * and * as a result of * the ( otherwise pointless ) suffering and death of jesus , humanity got something out of it . 
  interesting how such patterns seem to emerge even outside religion . 
  a now depopulated military training area in the mountains , [ vala\u0161kovce ] ( http://www.iabsi.com/gen/public/settlements/sl_valaskovce.htm ) . 
   was n't this a concern to those making trianon ? 
  it was a real clusterfuck , there was a lot of chaos involved and it could have happened in many different ways , in both directions from reality . 
  there are interesting books about the negotiations . 
  you also have to take into account that people did n't have very good data about stuff , and each side had their biases . 
  the entente also did n't care too much about the hungarians to pay too much attention to the exact borders and how fair they are . 
  they already promised areas to the nationalities in exchange for help . 
  so in the end other arguments won , not the wilsonian principles of self determination . 
  for example economy : access to the danube , good , arable lands ( [ compare satellite photo ] ( http://www.eurfedling.org/maps/satellite_slovakia.jpg ) ) , resources , things like that . 
  the border was then adjusted in 1938 with the first vienna award , but it was backed by germany and italy , so it was reversed after world war 2 .

  okay . 
  i think there 's no difference between a yes and a no answer in this regard . 
  both have the same power i think . 
  for example if the referendum were `` do you want hungary to stay in the eu ? '', 
  and people voted `` no '' that would still be binding on the parliament . 
  whether you ask the `` stay '' or the `` leave '' question does n't have such legal impact if i 'm correct . 
  it is a psychological influence , but not legal . 
   if it does and a referendum is held , the yes option cements the current conditions , while the no option creates no obligations for the parliament to change anything . 
  can you clarify this ? 
  is really only the yes result binding ? 
  i know , but it 's not specific to this photographer , it 's a style that 's emerging ( or maybe i just recently picked up on the pattern ) . 
  it 's also in movies sometimes . 
  it 's too artsy , `` sipping coffee in a rich capital 's caf\u00e9 and wondering about the poor people and how ` beautiful ' or how ` human ' their struggle is '' or something like this . 
  i think it rather distances them . 
  and it 's true that the cultures and atmospheres and life-outlooks and hopes and daily concerns are different . 
  but not in this cheap clich\u00e9 way that you can `` get '' by looking at a few drab images . 
  right , but in a caricaturized , comic-book-like way . 
  the same way we have the image of the `` starving african children '' , we have this image of the mature , deep and philosophical , longing , pure-soul-but-dirty-environment / clothes image of the poor people in eastern europe ( including but not limited to gypsies ) . 
  of course such prototypical representations get created for many out-groups of ours . 
  we used to have the image of the mysterious oriental people , the aladdin-like image of poverty in the middle east etc.
