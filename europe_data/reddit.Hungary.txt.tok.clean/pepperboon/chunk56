  because it 's a great way to get votes in romania . 
  bash the hungarians , `` look they are waving their scary flags !, 
  '' , `` those mountain villagers want to destroy us all ! '', 
  etc. . . 
   sell a lot of nice dreams to the hungarians and szekelys from romania in order to get some popularity and votes if you put the autonomy in this category , that just shows how romanians are still afraid that `` they want to take transylvania back '' , when that 's clearly impossible between eu , nato etc. 
  allies . 
  by the way autonomy is not independence ( this is another point that fearmongering romanian nationalists try to make confusion about ) . 
  but the romanian constitution says that romania is ethnically homogeneous , so the whole idea of autonomy becomes unconstitutional . 
  it does n't matter that there is a region with over 80 % and 90 % hungarians , the country is homogeneous because that 's what the constitution says , so there can be no autonomy . 
  i guess we 'll still have to wait some decades until we can talk about these things in a clear headed way . 
   cooking , cleaning , and laundry are necessary skills for everyone . 
  erm , you can do it without much skill . 
  of course it will show on the results , but young guys are also not known to live in the most impeccable and flawless ways . 
  cooking is not that difficult : eggs in a pan , meat in a pan with some seasoning , potatoes/pasta/rice in boiling water , cut vegetables , done . 
  it 's pretty hard to cook something you ca n't eat if you start with good ingredients . 
  laundry : dirty clothes in machine , 40 \u00b0 c , done . 
  cleaning : throw out garbage , sweep the floor , done . 
  because it 's not said by the actual police . 
  which is of course understandable as the police is part of the executive branch , i.e. 
  a government institution , so they have direct lines of communication to the government , they do n't have to talk through the press . 
  yeah , but when i read romanian comments it seems they believe we 're huge nationalists who would go and get transylvania back any day . 
  and the slovaks believe we care so much about them and that we still think we 're superior etc. , when in fact people usually just do n't give any thought to slovakia ( not too much to romania either ) . 
  we 're a pretty closed off nation mentally , we do n't care too much about what happens outside of the borders . 
  also there is a widespread dislike among hungarians in hungary against hungarians living in romania/slovakia/ukraine / serbia , and ignorant people often call them romanian/slovak etc , laugh at how they ca n't speak `` proper '' hungarian ( i.e. 
  dialect ) , they treat them as immigrants who take our jobs ( see the leftist `` 23 million romanians will come and take your jobs if we give citizenship to hungarians in transylvania '' , etc ) . 
  many hungarian kids also do n't know anything about our history , they have no idea when trianon was , and so on . 
  not much . 
  also , just because the two languages come from the same ancestor about 4000 years ago , it does n't mean we must be best bros ever . 
  i mean , 4000 years with basically no cultural contact ( with finns ) . 
  but we 're fine with the finns , we often give good points to each other at eurovision . 
  still , if you asked people which nation is closest to us ( as in friendship ) it would be poland for sure . 
  some far-right people dislike the finno-ugric relationship because the legends do n't contain it . 
  but this sentiment lost its significance since finland became rich and even right wingers are fine with it now . 
  it was a bigger issue in the 19th century . 
  people thought it 's just a way for austrians to break our national pride by associating us with `` primitive and boring fishermen '' instead of the glorious turkic civilizations . 
  romanians and slovaks imagine us as if the average hungarian were exploding from national pride . 
  actually we see ourselves as having inferiority complex , pessimism , powerlessness , `` let 's just learn to be small '' , `` we 're insignificant '' etc. 
  i guess those drawings are more cartoon-like , to align better with the wiggle-through analogy . 
  a bit like illustrating stuff with keys and locks in computer security perhaps . 
  also : i was n't just specifically answering you , but anyone who might write that question . 
  and that includes people who did n't realize it 's just a visualization tool . 
  these are precisely the things that users will never understand to care about . 
  users just wan na use . 
  if they see that dropbox is banned , they will get angry at the eu . 
  `` i 'm not paranoid , i have nothing to hide , stop this bullshit , i wan na use the cloud , it was so convenient until these pesky lawyers had to ban it , we 'll never catch up to the us tech scene , we are so backward , we ban the newest inventions '' , etc , etc. 
  what does it even mean that `` some of them need help '' ? 
  i think it 's rather a continuum , there is no sharp divide between those in need and those that are n't . 
  that 's why it 's a huge mistake to think that you can clearly separate economic migrants from refugees at the schengen borders . 
  ( here i do n't mean the `` not first safe country , turn back everyone '' idea . 
  often people think that a clear and significant number of them * are * in need but many are n't . ), 
  many of them do n't have jobs , they live in big poverty , have no hopes for their lives . 
  what is this sharp divide ? 
  what if you live in a poor town in africa with a lot of crime ? 
  does it only count if you house was bombed in war ? 
  what if you could never afford to have a house in the first place ? 
  it 's not so clear at all . 
  who ? 
  the czechs ? 
  this could only be true for hungarians and the balkans , but it depends on how much history they learned . 
  believe it or not , most kids do n't like learning ( at least in the way schools teach ) , so they rarely connect things like this . 
  in history you learn dates , events etc , but to connect it to today 's politics is not trivial . 
  also , we mostly learn it as we against the turks , it 's rarely phrased as we against the muslims . 
  also , the earlier the word was `` muzulm\u00e1n '' or `` mohamed\u00e1n '' , in today 's political news it 's `` muszlim '' . 
  i can imagine that a significant number of people do n't even know that those are the same . 
  also , the whole muslim topic has not really been relevant here for a long time , so people do n't have ( at least not until last year ) any political feelings about them . 
  the far-right was even pro-muslim in order to be anti-jew and anti-us , for example in the israel vs palestine or the us vs iran conflicts . 
  adding to thehm 's explanation , the red wave is just an illustration tool , there is no such wave there spacially . 
  i mean , the light comes in a single ray , over the black line . 
  the red wave just shows the properties of the em field in the corresponding part of the black line . 
  to explain further , the confusion is similar to believing that the velocity vector in [ this figure ] ( https://isaacphysics.org/api/images/content/questions/physics/mechanics/kinematics/level2/figures/kinematics_stopping_distances_total_3.svg ) required physical space , for example thinking that you ca n't park in a garage because the arrow needs to fit in at the front . 
  obviously , the arrow is just a visualization tool about the properties of the car 's movement . 
  similarly , the rad wave is just the visualization of the electric field on the black line . 
  so light is not physically present where the red wave is drawn and the `` wave can wiggle through or not '' - explanation can not be true . 
  it 's like that in villages or the suburbs in hungary too ( and between good neighbors in cities as well ) . 
  but in general people are n't that happy in general . 
  there are often conflicts among people who live in the same building ( about renovations , bills etc. ) . 
  it certainly helps that dutch people do n't have real financial problems . 
  while money and happiness connected in a relative way ( wealth relative to expectation is correlated to happiness ) , hungarians often expect to belong to the western block and make as much , so there is this constant disappointment , which makes people pessimistic ( and a whole lot of other reasons too ) . 
   why do n't they have their own nation ? 
  because they are not organized , not united , they do n't have money , let alone military etc. 
  orsz\u00e1g means country . 
  [ see this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/417rzu/country_names_in_hungarian/ ) ( the image and comments ) for more info . 
  i could n't find better ones . 
  ( edit : [ here 's a less cluttered version ] ( http://eucilaff.tovarnaidej.com/static/madzarski-jezik/5/nyelvjarasok.jpg ) ) the standard hungarian language ( the one used most in literature and media ) was based on the north eastern dialect ( reddish-purple ) , the place where ferenc kazinczy ( 1759-1831 ) was born who led the language reform movement . 
  nowadays dialects are becoming less and less prominent , with the centralization effects of the media . 
  some dialectal forms are often stigmatized as `` peasant-ish '' , uneducated etc. , so young people often try to use the standard variant and can become `` bi-dialectal '' . 
  most of the time it 's not easy to tell where someone is from based on their speech . 
  the easiest to recognize are the transylvanian ( east , light blue and green ) and pal\u00f3c ( north , purple ) dialects . 
  the southern great plain dialect is also recognizable for its frequent use of * \u00f6 * instead of standard * e * 's , but young people often do n't do it , to avoid sounding uneducated . 
  ( for older locals this seems posh and pretentious and snobbish . ), 
  by the way , here 's the [ map of regions with hungarian speakers outside the current borders of hungary ] ( https://imgur.com/vyr3yoe ), 
  because fence and stricter laws . 
  political stuff . 
  [ my other comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/41j03a/names_of_european_countries_in_turkish/cz3a94f ), 
  it 's political . 
  the slovak interpretation of history does n't recognize the continuity between pre - and post-wwi hungary in an attempt to make trianon seem fair . 
  instead , it sees the dissolution of austria-hungary as if totally new countries had been created over that land , not that hungary lost territories , but that the land was split anew , each ethnicity getting their own country . 
  but legally speaking , hungary is still the same state , we retained the same government , the institutional framework , flag , anthem , coat-of-arms , everything . 
  it was a two-step event , in 1918 austria-hungary dissolved to austria and hungary ( still big ) , and then in 1920 territories were taken away from hungary , but it remained the same country . 
  romanians do n't have this linguistic issue .
