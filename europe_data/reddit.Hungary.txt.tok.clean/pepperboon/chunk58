  sure , if you 're a naive anarchist , you do n't think that far , but these things have consequences down the road . 
  and i know it 's not the uber drivers protesting . 
  because they also do n't look too far ahead . 
  well , `` orsz\u00e1g '' alone simply means `` country '' ( independent sovereign state , like `` ausztria egy orsz\u00e1g . '', 
  = `` austria is a country . '' ) . 
  but it 's not `` country '' as in `` countryside '' , that would be `` vid\u00e9k '' . 
  for example the translation of the movie title `` no country for old men '' uses `` vid\u00e9k '' , not `` orsz\u00e1g '' because it does n't refer to a sovereign country , but simply a rural region . 
   so native speakers do n't know how the declension works if native speakers do n't know it , it 's not part of the language . 
   it 's just that there are n't other nouns with the same pattern as koko yes , many times in languages there are such outliers with no good analogous frequent words and in these cases native speakers feel uncertain themselves as to how they should say a certain form . 
  this is an interesting phenomenon to study , and it 's somewhat related to `` defective words '' where certain forms ( which would have a sensible meaning ) simply do n't exist ( for example there is no subjunctive-imperative form of `` hiccup '' in hungarian ) . 
  but the fact that dictionary authors chose one variant as the `` right one '' does n't mean anything further . 
  this is a philosophical difference between prescriptivism and descriptivism . 
  this simply means there is no solidified form for this type of declension ( btw . 
  conjugation is used for verbs ) , or that there is variation or that a change is happening . 
  there are such examples in every language . 
  from a descriptive , scientific point of view it really does n't matter what the dictionary editors and grammar book writers think ( often based on their own intuition , not based on actual data gathered from native speakers ) , what matters is how the native speakers use the language . 
  anyway , that 's the age of prescriptivist vs. descriptivist debate ( `` do rule books or native speakers define languages ? '' ), 
  that has been basically settled in science with descriptivism being the sensible approach . 
  not sure if you 're joking , but that does n't really happen . 
  maybe you 're comparing the formal written finnish language with the casual spoken version . 
  well , if montenegin , serbian , bosnian and croatian are all different languages , then sure , sz\u00e9kely could also be standardized to be a language of its own ( with things like `` es '' instead of `` is '' and other stuff ) . 
  or the szeged dialect could be also considered a separate language with all those \u00f6 's . 
  language vs. dialect is always politics . 
  but i never had any difficulty understanding it . 
  yeah , another nice point of connection . 
  we do n't use it in isolation , though . 
  it 's mostly part of `` kurva any\u00e1d '' , meaning `` your whore mother '' , a shortening of `` baszd meg a kurva any\u00e1d '' = `` fuck your whore mother '' , the other half of which `` baszd meg '' ( sometimes written `` bazmeg '' ) is also widespread in itself . 
  or `` kurva \u00e9letbe '' ( `` to the whore life '' ) . 
  or as an adjective in some more elaborate swearing sentence . 
  only if you 're a linguist . 
  there are a handful of similar words , but even cognates are severely distorted . 
  the two languages diverged around 4000 years ago ( hard to tell exactly ) . 
  for example `` mouse '' is `` hiiri '' in finnish and `` eg\u00e9r '' in hungarian , both are derived from the proto-finno-ugric '' * \u0161i\u014bere '' . 
  or tree is `` puu '' in finnish and `` fa '' in hungarian . 
  or hungarian '' \u00e9g '' ( sky ) is etymologically related to finnish `` s\u00e4\u00e4 '' ( weather ) . 
  we understand zero from finnish , nothing at all , not even the gist or even the topic . 
  some hungarians say it sounds vaguely similar to hungarian from far away , with enough background noise . 
  but that 's all . 
  so some laypeople say this is all bullshit , `` hiiri '' ca n't be related to `` eg\u00e9r '' and they come up with fringe theories of sumerian and etruscan or even japanese etc. 
  superficial correspondences . 
  also , in some circles the conspiracy theory still exists that hungarian is not uralic , that 's just a 19th century fabrication by austrians to destroy the national pride of hungarians with these fishy-smelling relatives , instead of glorious turkic or sumerian relatives . 
  needless to say , since finland became rich , most people are now perfectly fine with the association . 
  i like [ finlandia ] ( http://www.finlandia.com/assets/img/facebook/finlandia.jpg ) . 
  `` g\u00f6rd\u00fcl '' ( and `` g\u00f6rd\u00fcl\u00e9keny '' ) is more frequent . 
  also `` g\u00f6rg\u0151 '' for those wheel-like things . 
  and `` g\u00f6r\u00f6ngy '' . 
  and that 's what every language feels like to a hungarian who ca n't speak foreign languages . 
  for us the weird thing is to imagine someone speaking a language that 's similar but not identical to your own . 
  which is pretty normal for speakers of slavic , germanic and romance speakers , but we never get to experience that . 
  the closest languages to hungarian are hanti and mansi in siberia , but you still ca n't understand anything at all from them as a hungarian . 
  but that 's the state in the us . 
  referring to the country in the caucasus region , it 's pronounced `` georgia '' . 
  it has nothing to do with * grammar * . 
  grammar is stuff like conjugation ( e.g. 
  past tense ) , declension ( e.g. 
  accusative case ) , word order , use of prepositions , articles etc. 
  yeah , it 's pronounced the same , just written phonetically in the hungarian way . 
   how does you say https://youtu.be/p1efyyoxa4k?t=1m1s, 
  yeah , the budapest `` standard '' dialect does n't differentiate them , but most dialects do . 
  you mean sadistic . 
  it 's a good poem though . 
  [ here 's the folk metal cover of it by dalriada ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi48-1qj0se ), 
  `` orsz\u00e1g '' is country , originally from '' \u00far '' ( `` lord '' ) + '' - s\u00e1g '' ( '' - ship '' , '' - ness '' ) , basically `` lordship '' . 
  `` land '' would be `` f\u00f6ld '' , for example `` thaif\u00f6ld '' is hungarian for `` thailand '' , also `` szv\u00e1zif\u00f6ld '' ( `` swasiland '' ) , `` lappf\u00f6ld '' ( `` lapland '' ) . 
  we also have the archaic word `` ol\u00e1h '' for `` romanian '' , from the same origin . 
  yeah it probably originally meant an `` unspecified romance language-speaker from around the region '' . 
  but vlach and olasz are cognates . 
  yeah , there are different levels of precision . 
  when meaning the uk , we often casually just say `` anglia '' . 
  a bit more correctly we say `` nagy-britannia '' . 
  the actual `` egyes\u00fclt kir\u00e1lys\u00e1g '' ( `` united kingdom '' ) is not so widespread and sounds like a too direct translation and a bit pretentious . 
  also , it may seem natural in english , but simply `` united kingdom '' skips the most important part , united kingdom of * what * ? 
  it 's like saying the `` people 's republic '' to mean china . 
  so saying uk in non-english languages seems to elevate the importance of the uk as a country , since it 's `` obvious '' that you mean it even when not naming it actually . 
  i feel the same with the us . 
  earlier it was always said like `` amerikai egyes\u00fclt \u00c1llamok '' ( `` american united states '' ) , but nowadays more and more just `` egyes\u00fclt \u00c1llamok '' . 
  it just just too intimate and close . 
  it 's unterstandable for americans to shorten it , but for european countries it seems too familiar . 
  yes , and it 's sometimes ( not really anymore today ) written phonetically in hungarian as `` velsz '' . 
  you could be `` belgaorsz\u00e1g '' ( belgian-country ) . 
  `` n\u00e9met '' ( `` german '' ) comes from a slavic language , compare slovak `` nemec '' , or polish `` niemiec '' ( also meaning `` german '' ) . 
  it originally means `` dumb '' / `` mute '' . 
  according to wiktionary , it may be etymologically related to english `` mute '' and german `` mummeln '' ( `` mumble '' ) , too . 
  `` olasz '' ( `` italian ) '' comes from slavic `` vlah '' , meaning `` romanian '' ( `` vlach '' ) . 
  i 'm not sure why it came to mean italian . 
  it 's old news , it 's like this since november i think . 
  yeah , but most native speakers do n't instinctively grammatically analyze what they say , they have a stream of speech in their heads and they transcribe that to text . 
  but it usually shows a lack of caring and that the person does n't read too many books ( unless the person has some mental condition , like dyslexia or similar ) . 
  but spelling is a totally different thing than the language itself . 
  even historically , writing itself is much much more recent than spoken language . 
  also , small children first learn to speak , they only learn to write in school . 
  written language is not their native language . 
  so everything that i said was about spoken language . 
  linguistics basically only studies and cares about spoken language . 
  spelling and orthography are much more arbitrary conventions with lots of historical baggage , there 's not much interesting to be studied and said about spelling . 
  there are basically no more migrants in hungary . 
  linguistically speaking , native speakers can not make consistent mistakes . 
  if they use a pattern consistently ( for example `` i 'm good '' instead of `` well '' ) , it means that the language contains this pattern . 
  there are no other criteria for correctness in any language other than how the native speakers speak . 
  languages change .
