  you do n't speak old english nor middle english . 
  does it mean you speak incorrectly ? 
  it 's nonsense . 
  is spanish incorrect and only latin correct ? 
  or is latin incorrect too and only proto-italic was correct ? 
  or maybe only proto-indo-european was perfection and it 's been going downhill ever since ? 
  or the first vocalizations of the `` cavemen '' were perfection ? 
  my hypothesis is that it 's different for them because they learned the language speech-first , while we learned to read and write english at the same time as we learned to speak it . 
  so when they are writing they are basically converting speech to text in their minds , while we are more directly composing the text itself . 
  i mean , we probably think the word `` their '' as written , we do n't convert the way it sounds to letters . 
  it also helps with writing if you have a bad accent and you pronounce they 're and their or your and you 're differently . 
  i think i pronounce them slightly differently , or at least in my mind i do . 
  maybe it comes out almost the same , but still i feel like i 'm reading the way it 's written , so even if it comes out the same , it feels like a different road to the same destination . 
  in short , it makes little sense to compare spelling mistakes made by native speakers and second-language speakers . 
  well , hopefully not as bad . 
  here it 's usually used in a derisive manner as in `` it 's like in latin america ! '' . 
  anyway , it 's hard to give a nuanced picture of these things in a comment . 
  the socialists fucked up majorly in their 8 years and most people had enough of them for a life . 
  now even the far-right jobbik is more popular than them . 
  the left in hungary is fragmented , the socialist party broke into two , and they have no charismatic leaders ( except the former pm gyurcs\u00e1ny , whom most people viscerally hate ) . 
  they all came together in the last elections and participated as one block and got 26 % vs. the 46 % of fidesz and 20 % of jobbik . 
  the soviet influence was a lot longer and heavily influenced the mentality of the people . 
  for example that people prefer strong centralized leadership , want the state to take care of them and do stuff instead of them , see state-owned things as nobody 's things , public money as stealable without there being a victim , corruption , etc. 
  not that it 's infallible , but it may help to read the lead section of the [ austrians wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrians ) . 
   austrians are a germanic ethnic group ( ... ) however , austrians are better described as a nationality , rather than an ethnic group . 
  historically , austrians are considered to be germans and viewed themselves as such . 
  ( ... ) since the events of world war ii , austrians have developed their own distinct national identity and mostly do not consider themselves to be germans . 
  so hitler was n't `` an austrian '' in today 's sense , because today 's concept of being austrian is not the same as that in 1889 . 
  also , he was born just a few hundred meters away from germany 's border . 
  hitler was as german as it gets . 
  it 's an anachronism to deny this . 
  he was brought up to think of himself as german and everyone living around him thought of themselves as germans as well . 
  the country and the nationality were n't as tightly coupled back then as today . 
  at the time , people had a general ethnic identity , often based on the language they spoke ( and/or their religion ) , and a strong local identity ( on the scale of a few towns in the neighborhood ) . 
  it was usual for countries/empires to be multiethnic and the idea that there have to be nation states for each nationality was pretty new . 
  do n't confuse country names with ethnicity names . 
  there were germans before the creation of germany ( like there were romanians before romania was created and slovaks before slovakia was created etc. ) . 
  at the time , people usually called the german-speaking people of austria-hungary `` germans '' . 
  `` austrian '' was n't considered an ethnicity distinct from `` german '' . 
  today 's austria was created after wwi , under the name of `` republic of german-austria '' . 
  because it was the part of the previous austria where ( most ) `` germans '' lived ( as opposed to the parts of former-austria inhabited by czechs for example ) . 
  after wwii , austria tried to distance itself from germany in identity , not to be seen as a successor state to nazi germany . 
  they obviously tried to downplay their role in nazism and made themselves look more of a victim than they actually were ( austrians were n't as clearly against the anschluss as people would imagine today ) . 
   ( which was n't even entirely indoeuropean let alone ` germanic ' in character ) you 're confusing the classification of languages with national-ethnical relatedness . 
  indo-european is really a misplaced term here . 
  because these countries are relatively new . 
  i do n't think people here feel much like a `` community '' . 
  at least the `` community '' concept is still somewhat foreign to me . 
  people are trying to translate it and use it ( `` k\u00f6z\u00f6ss\u00e9g '' ) , but it often feels artificial ( feels a bit like when employees are `` forced '' to become a `` team '' and sing and clap together ) . 
  an example of such modern change is that the official word for `` public transport '' is now `` k\u00f6z\u00f6ss\u00e9gi k\u00f6zleked\u00e9s '' ( `` community transport '' ) instead of the former `` t\u00f6megk\u00f6zleked\u00e9s '' ( `` crowd/mass transport '' ) . 
  it 's a bit hard to put this in words . 
  for example the expression `` your local community '' is just totally american ( in concept ) to my ears . 
  the `` your '' part is already weird , we usually do n't say `` your '' or `` my '' in these cases . 
  and then `` local '' ( you did n't use it ) is also something we do n't say explicitly as often as americans . 
  it 's just kind of implied that it 's the local thing , since that 's closest . 
  like instead of `` your local supermarket '' we 'd just say `` the supermarket '' . 
  the american way feels too personal , overly sweet , sugarcoated , like the company trying to lick my ass so that i buy their stuff . 
  i 'm just trying to give a peek into how different the mentality can be . 
  we do n't really think of the people living in a street as a community ( at least in cities and towns ) . 
  it has disadvantages for sure , but i feel it 's more realistic . 
  why do you have to be friends just because you live nearby ? 
  you can be friends with people who share your interests or who you 've known from school or coworkers etc. 
  but it seems artificial to see a street as a community . 
  the downside is that nobody feels responsible , developments are slower , it 's hard to agree on things , improve stuff . 
  often the apartements in large buildings look really nice in the inside but the outside parts ( corridors , stairs , mailboxes etc ) look terrible , simply because there is no feeling of community , even in the same building , and people do n't feel like they are responsible or are part of that . 
  the name was first , then the penis meaning . 
  we in eastern europe mostly connect over complaining . 
  for example if the bus is late , we could talk about how fucked up the public transport company is and like `` have you heard the a metro burned out last week again '' `` yeah , so crappy '' . 
  otherwise people are n't so enthusiastic and energetic towards strangers as americans . 
  it seems like too much bragging , like `` why are you so happy , damn '' . 
  people sometimes talk late at night , when coming back from bars , drunk . 
  but otherwise not really . 
  many people also listen to music , read something on their phones or a book etc. 
  i also prefer to just think and daydream . 
  i 'd be very annoyed if someone talked to me about sports . 
  sport is apparently not as universal as a topic here as in the us . 
  well , if you 're going to work or school you do n't always have a choice . 
  also , the next bus can be crowded too . 
  you could get up early , before the rush-hours , but i 'm a night owl , i prefer sleeping longer . 
  for example , when i went to school we were lucky to live near a bus stop where there still were some empty seats on the bus , but then it got really crowded in a few minutes . 
  the ride took like half an hour and i preferred to sit and sleep in the early morning , instead of standing and being pushed around , barely finding something to hold onto . 
  people only waited for the next bus when it was physically impossible to step into the bus . 
  it was more often that the driver said that people must get off because it 's unsafe , rather than voluntarily . 
  but of course everyone hated this , but if you need to get to work then you need to . 
  interesting . 
  we hungarians seem to be a mixture of these . 
  with strangers we are similar to nordic countries , barely acknowledging the existence of the other , not much smalltalk ( except for the elderly ) , but with non-strangers we kiss on the cheek ( 2 or 3 times ) if one of the people is a girl/woman , and often put hands around shoulders etc with friends . 
  it 's like there are two modes of operation . 
  well , sometimes you know that the bus is going to be very crowded , then it 's absolutely important to find a seat , because standing in the crowd is even worse . 
  but i guess dutch buses are frequent enough that there is no real crowding ( i mean , where the door can barely be closed and people are sqeezing-pushing each other inside and you can barely breathe ) . 
  yeah , it 's always weird when i read that on reddit . 
  i understand `` harrassed '' , `` assaulted '' , `` attacked '' , `` intimidated '' , `` threatened '' , `` humiliated '' , `` hurt '' etc. 
  but i do n't really get the concept behind `` violated '' . 
  you can violate a rule or law but i do n't get how you violate a person . 
  it 's really the same in hungary ( at least in budapest ) . 
  strangers rarely talk to each other . 
  maybe to ask whether the bus has already left , or something about how to get somewhere ( less necessary now that we have displays at bus stops showing when the next buses come , and real-time route planning apps ) . 
  no chit-chat , fortunately . 
  the normal german word for suicide is `` selbstmord '' , literally self-murder . 
  so the story does n't make sense since it was always called `` self-murder '' .
