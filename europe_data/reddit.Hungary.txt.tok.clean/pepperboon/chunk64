  `` dolguk '' means `` their job/task/duty '' . 
  in this context , something like their natural role , their godgiven mission , their responsibility , the thing we should require/expect from them , etc. 
  it 's not about forbidding , he basically says that emancipation and equal rights movements lead to pointless stuff like female weightlifters and he goes on to explain that women 's hips and men 's shoulders are wider for a reason . 
  he also says that men and women are equally important but have different roles , as described in genesis . 
  he does n't mean it in a way that we should force them to give birth to children , on the contrary : he thinks the modern emancipated women are forced to do something that does n't fit them naturally . 
  it 's fine to disagree with him , but he 's not speaking out against women taking up such duties , but against this system that equates all value with money and therefore says that women have to go out and earn as much as men . 
  i also disagree with him in many ways ( also for example about using religion as an argument ) , but he 's not saying that we must forbid this to women , but rather that we should enable them to be in their natural role . 
  for more context , see [ this partially subtitled video of the interview ] ( http://amara.org/en/videos/9ljd3v3c7haz/info/kovacs-akos-arckep/ ) from 9:10 . 
  here is the video of the interview of \u00c1kos , i subtitled the relevant part , from 9:10 , so that non-hungarians can understand what the whole fuss is about . 
  well , he was in prison for 3 and a half years . 
  i guess you ca n't put someone in prison for much longer if they have n't committed actual criminal actions besides talking and preaching and fund-raising . 
  maybe you misunderstood it . 
  they are still in hungary in detention ( or whatever is the precise term , under arrest etc ) . 
  no occupation is legal , no military conquest is seen as legitimate , especially not by the victims . 
  hungary could also say - and indeed many people do - that the ottoman occupation did not `` really happen '' in the legal sense , because our historic constitution and the rule of the holy crown can not be overruled by such things , and hungary was united all along , when in fact a certain part effectively became part of the ottoman empire , another part became a half-autonomous but basically ottoman oriented satellite state , and yet another was ruled by the habsburg austrians . 
  so yeah we can say the spirit of the holy crown still floated above these lands , but again , unless you are involved in it emotionally , there 's no sense in talking about it like that . 
  latvia was not independent in practice . 
  yes , in abstract imaginary legal theory it might have been . 
  [ according to reuters sources ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/18/us-hungary-britain-arrest-iduskcn0t719r20151118 ) , they are well-known islamists : * [ abu izzadeen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abu_izzadeen ) ( born trevor brooks ) . 
  [ here 's one speech by him ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2d0tp3efqk ) . 
  * [ sulayman keeler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sulayman_keeler ) ( born simon keeler ) , whose incarceration was described by hstoday as the `` first time a white convert has been incarcerated for islamist terror charges in the uk . '', 
  [ video of him talking ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkz1pjdgh_a ) edit : updated with reuters source . 
  they retroactively reinterpreted their history as if they had been independent all along . 
  yeah , it makes no sense but it 's probably a sensitive issue . 
  every system regards the system before it as illegitimate , illegal , non-existent de jure , `` the true system was there in the background all along '' etc. 
  there 's really no point in arguing this . 
  it 's like arguing whether taiwan has power over mainland china or not . 
  some people will say yes , they are still the legitimate power in mainland china and then comes an elaborate legal explanation of how the communists did illegal stuff and the real government is just in exile in taiwan etc. 
  i prefer to just look at the de facto situation because everything else is just mental gymnastics and theoretical musings . 
  i was once at a german hausarzt ( gp ) , an i was astonished by the amount of pseudoscientific medical stuff there . 
  homeopathy , acupunture , a poster of an ear and a foot , marking areas responsible for different diseases etc. 
  just astonishing how this can happen . 
  probably because being a gp is a private business model in germany , so they have to compete for the patients and apparently patients want nonsense . 
  makes you wonder how much of a good idea it is to let market forces decide in things like medicine . 
  apparently unknown outside hungary but considered a masterpiece in hungary , [ the tragedy of man ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_tragedy_of_man ) ( [ text online ] ( http://mek.oszk.hu/00900/00918/html/ ) ) by mad\u00e1ch was the only classic book i could read to the end from my own will of all the compulsory reads in school . 
  it 's a reflective look at human history , the struggle of humanity in progress higher and higher but getting disappointed . 
  it 's a very symbolic book . 
  each scene is set in a historic era from the beginning of time through eras like ancient egypt , kepler and the scientific revolution , and even a dystopian future of a rational but uniform and dull society and even some scenes in outer space . 
  in each scene adam , eve and lucifer ( satan ) `` reincarnate '' in a contemporary historic figure . 
  it 's a surprisingly modern philosophical book ( although it was published in 1861 ) , touching on ethics , purpose etc. 
  the most genial parts are lucifers comments , as he intelligently but not maliciously smashes adams dreams , aspirations and struggles as meaningless and pointless and adam tries to argue and defend himself . 
  the scenes are : * scene 1 -- in heaven , immediately following the creation . 
  * scene 2 -- in the garden of eden at the beginning of time . 
  * scene 3 -- outside the garden of eden at the beginning of time . 
  adam is a pharaoh , most likely djoser ; lucifer his vizier ; eve is the wife of a slave . 
  adam is miltiades the younger ; lucifer is a guard ; eve is miltiades ' wife . 
  adam is a wealthy roman ; lucifer is his friend , eve is a prostitute . 
  * scene 7 -- constantinople , ad 1096 . 
  adam is prince tancred of hauteville ; lucifer is his squire ; eve is a noble maiden forced to become a nun . 
  * scene 8 -- prague , c. ad 1615 . 
  adam is johannes kepler ; lucifer is his pupil ; eve is his wife , barbara . 
  * scene 9 -- paris , ad 1793 ( in a dream of kepler ) . 
  adam is georges danton ; lucifer is an executioner ; eve appears in two forms , first as an aristocrat about to be executed , then immediately following as a bloodthirsty poor woman . 
  * scene 10 -- prague , c. ad 1615 . 
  adam is johannes kepler ; lucifer is his pupil ; eve is his wife , barbara . 
  * scene 11 -- london , 19th century . 
  adam and lucifer are nameless englishmen ; eve is a young woman of the middle class . 
  * scene 12 -- a communist/technocratic phalanstery , in the future . 
  adam and lucifer masquerade as traveling chemists ; eve is a worker who protests when she is separated from her child . 
  * scene 13 -- space . 
  adam and lucifer are themselves , eve does not appear in this scene . 
  * scene 14 -- an ice age in the distant future , at least ad 6000 . 
  adam is a broken old man ; lucifer is himself ; eve is an eskimo 's wife . 
  * scene 15 -- outside eden at the beginning of time . 
  my ideas on americans are formed largely through movies and reddit . 
  as the other commenter said , people on reddit suggest going to a therapist for things that could perhaps be solved having a good talk with a friend , too . 
  but the individualist society alienates people and many people do n't have anyone to talk to , so they pay a therapist . 
  of course it 's a caricature . 
  but everything is like that when we are communicating in so few lines of comments . 
  blaming substances is naive . 
  if you ca n't get access to alcohol you do n't just magically sort out your wrecked life . 
  i recommend you [ this short video about addiction ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao8l-0nsyzg ) . 
  oh fat and sugar alter the brain well , too and can lead to escapism and unhealthy coping mechanisms . 
  is it healthy if you counter your stress and depressed feelings with eating huge bowls of chips , pizza and coke and become 130 kg ? 
  drinking a few glasses of wine or beer at social events wo n't make you an alcoholic asshole who shouts and beats his family with a belt when he gets home from the bar at night . 
  maybe i 'm not using words right , or maybe you ca n't comprehend , but i 'm not talking about binge drinking now , but the levels that are currently seen as healthy and i 'm debating whether it makes sense to restrict it to absolute zero due to negative health effects on your physical organs . 
  i 'm not talking about alcoholism ruining your life , but giving up the social culture of a glass of wine in exchange for reduced risk of some diseases . 
  organising big feasts with fatty foods can also be socially useful , while bad physically . 
  i do n't talk about getting black out drunk . 
  and it seems that many-many people drink alcohol for this chill feeling of less inhibitions . 
  i admit that wine can taste good in itself , but you can feel a slight sensation of the alcohol even after a glass of it . 
  and it can make romantic dinners better too . 
  of course you can insist on using no external substances , also never eating fatty or sweet foods for enjoyment because enjoyment must be deserved by discipline , hard work and struggle and it 's cheating to get it through such cheap methods , okay i can accept this as a philosophy , but not everyone has to act like that . 
  obviously i 'm talking about a balance . 
  not alcoholism taking over your life and being unable to function before drinking a shot in the morning . 
  my stereotypical idea is that americans can not show weakness in everyday relationships , the mile-wide american smile must be kept , everything must be awesome and you 're supposed to feel great , and complaining is n't socially accepted . 
  so there is little support from your social environment , friends , family etc. , you need to pay someone to listen . 
  based on reddit , yes . 
  feminism and transgender debates , atheism/creationism debates , college campus political correctness , circumcision , gun control , etc. 
  maybe this is just a language issue , but americans seem to wonder a lot about whether something is `` a thing '' or when it became `` a thing '' . 
  maybe it 's just a turn of phrase , but it seems to be a unique concept to me . 
  it 's also hard to translate meaningfully . 
  exactly . 
  i never understood this idea that `` the internet is fascinated by cats '' . 
  i just do n't get it . 
  not * why * people are fascinated by cats , but why people * think * that so many people are fascinated by cats . 
  it 's just not `` a thing '' here . 
  if one or two glasses of wine make you feel better at dinner and helps your social life , then does it really matter if it carries a minuscule risk of physical health ? 
  maybe it enables you to bond better with people , leading to better motivation levels , less stress etc. 
  of course i 'm not talking about alcoholism , i 'm specifically referring to the levels that we accept as normal today .
