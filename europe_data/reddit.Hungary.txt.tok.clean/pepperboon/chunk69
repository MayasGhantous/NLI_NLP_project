  you can eat a `` gyros t\u00e1l '' ( gyros/kebab with fries and salad ) plus a coke for this price around nyugati railway station . 
  by city center i do n't mean tourist center or v\u00e1ci utca . 
  i simply mean the busy part of the city with lots of public transport etc. 
  places like nyugati . 
  if you go to a chinese place , you can get a soup + meat with rice ( 800 huf ) and a coke ( 350 huf ) , totalling 1150 huf ( 3.7 $ ) . 
  yes it 's not gourmet food . 
  you must pay for quality , that 's what i meant . 
  but many people just eat some simple dish , like an egg soup ( toj\u00e1sleves ) plus lentil stew with sausage ( lencsef\u0151zel\u00e9k virslivel ) which again costs around 800 huf . 
  above 6 $ counts as quite expensive for a simple everyday lunch . 
  most people are n't willing or able to pay that much every day . 
  well , i can compare hungarian and german student cafeterias and the quality is really different . 
  germans like to complain how the mensa is shit , they 'd probably throw up if they saw what hungarian students get at their menza . 
  also , take chinese fast food . 
  you can get it for 2 $ in budapest and it 's quite okay , i ate a lot of it myself , but it ca n't be compared to an actual chinese restaurant . 
  in western europe people do n't fuck around with such cheap restaurants . 
  if they go to eat something , then quality is expected , it 's not even something to think about , it 's just natural that food is good quality . 
  and they have waiters even in everyday , normal restaurants where students eat regularly ( even in bars actually , but that 's a different topic ) . 
  so the service is also different . 
  one thing to note about the price differences is that people in poorer countries also eat lower quality lunch in general . 
  so when you see that `` lunch is cheap '' somewhere , you should also look at its quality , the ingredients , the environment , the staff , the service etc. 
  so , anyway budapest : about 2.5 $ ( 750 huf ) if you eat something cheap ( chinese fast food , gyros/kebab , or some simple hungarian dishes ) . 
  if you want to eat soup , or something bigger , better ( like a gyros plate ) and also drink something , then you still wo n't have to pay more than 6 $ ( 1800 huf ) even in the city center . 
  ( these are all places without waiters , you just go to the front with a tray , say what you want , get it and pay for it at the cashiers before eating . 
  restaurants with waiters are more expensive , but people do n't usually eat at such places for everyday lunch ) . 
  all are after taxes . 
  [ data ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage#eurostat ) edit : you are right i messed up lithuania . 
  the image is now corrected . 
  let 's compare it to the wages !, 
  [ here is the chart with 20 years of net wages marked ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ykgwbvp.jpg ), 
  we should compare it to the wealth of the people too . 
  [ here 's the chart with 20 years of average net salary marked ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ykgwbvp.jpg ) . 
  the net monthly salary in norway is 3850 $ , while in say latvia it 's 379 $ . 
  you make more than 10 times as much money and the houses cost a bit less than 10 times as much . 
   our problem is not money , we 're running out of space you can convert money to living space by building things . 
  `` the life sentence in sweden actually does mean prison for life '' and then you go on to explain how they can get out after 18 , 25 , 30 , 34 etc years . 
  if you can get out it 's not true that it `` actually does mean prison for life '' . 
  hungary used to have * actual * prison for life , which means you 're locked up and will definitely only come out in a body bag , no way to become free ever again . 
  but the european court of human rights ruled that it 's inhumane to take away the hope from prisoners and now hungary changed the law and now the case can be reassessed after 40 years . 
  it 's lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , romania , croatia , serbia , bulgaria , slovenia ( did n't get any place but was considered ) ... 
  i would definitely not count lithuania , serbia and bulgaria as central europe . 
  romania , okay on a good day . 
  it 's basically an eastern eu group ( minus latvia and estonia , plus serbia ) . 
  the czech republic is n't even on the migration route . 
  is it just about a rejection of the quota system ? 
  sure , i mention that later on . 
  most people do n't rent in hungary , except for students or young people . 
  most people buy a place by taking loans which they need to pay back for about the next 20 years . 
  but the amount is quite individual , so it 's hard to put a figure on it . 
  if we say it 's 280 $ per month , then the daily money left for food , clothes , toys , culture , house maintenance and unexpected expenses and so on is only ** 3.3 $ / person/day ** . 
  if you drink a coffee in the morning and a beer in the evening it 's already 1.3 $ and you have 2 $ left . 
  even at a cheap chinese buffet you have to pay 2.5 $ for a meal without a drink . 
  a kebab ( gyros ) is around 2-2 .5 $ as well . 
  a big mac sandwich is around 3 $ . 
  so from 2 euro , you have to eat breakfast , lunch and dinner . 
  if you manage it , then you have exactly 0 $ left to spend on clothes , cleaning products or anything around the house . 
  now * this * is budgeting , not whether i can go to paris or london . 
  travelling is not an option for lots of families in central europe , too . 
  if you make an average countryside hungarian salary of 400 $ ( after taxes ) , plus your spouse too , and you have 2 kids then you get 85 $ family benefits , meaning you have 885 euros . 
  say , just approximately , water 20 $ , electricity 25 $ , heating 60 $ ( averaged over the year ) , public transport for both adults 45 $ , for both kids 20 $ . 
  internet , tv 25 $ , garbage 8 $ . 
  ( and i 'm sure there are other costs i 'm forgetting now ) ( what if you need to have a car for your job ? 
  gas costs about 1 $ / liter , then maintenance costs etc. 
  let 's forget about it for now and just use public transport . ), 
  so we have 682 $ or ** 5.6 $ per person per day left for food , clothing , home maintenance , culture , school equipment , toys etc , and to cover emergency costs ** ( accidents , getting sick , replacing/repairing the fridge , washing machine , water heater etc. ), 
  or just sparing some money for some bigger purchase . 
  how could such a family afford to go out or `` travel '' ? 
  they wo n't starve , sure , but moving forward in such a financial situation is very hard and after years and years living like this you can get quite hopeless and pessimistic . 
  many people have no savings whatsoever , by which i mean a literal big fat zero ( 0 ) of savings . 
  moreover , many people have debts . 
  mortgage or other . 
  they are living literally from one month to the next , sometimes dropping into negative balance on the bank account . 
  and this was the * average * on the hungarian countryside , not the poor ones . 
  ( budapest is better , though ) . 
  poor people have absolutely no way to make any steps forward . 
  their house rots down on them , they get into more and more debt , need benefits , etc. 
  ukrainian pay is a lot a shittier still !, 
  i 'm just writing this down is such detail because `` poor '' is a relative term . 
  for example in germany , you get more unemployment benefits than the full time salary of people in rural hungary ( and no , the costs and prices are not that much higher in germany ) . 
  they should give up the idea of `` ah we will sort them out later and they will get deported '' . 
  accept the idea that anyone who comes , stays . 
  so if you do n't want so many people to stay , do n't let them in in the first place . 
  `` blaming '' is a universal thing we all do to ease our minds . 
  we ( general we ) blame the rich , the famous , the minorities , etc. 
  i talked with some of such guys over reddit ( not gamers specifically , just bitter ones ) , and i think they are at a bad place mentally . 
  i do n't think anyone wants to become or likes to be bitter . 
  you also need to consider that one of the worst things for the masculine image is to be undesired by women . 
  so nobody wants to take that identity up , so they must construct a different explanation involving luck or hostility from the side of girls . 
  like `` oh girls are just stupid and go for the jerks because they are sluts and can not appreciate my actual greatness '' , `` i 'm too great for them to even understand '' or something . 
  people have to construct their mental defenses , otherwise they collapse . 
  of course this does n't make it better when you have to deal with such people , but behind many of such nasty or clumsily seductive comment and message you find pretty crappy lives , too ( but then again , many are simply immature trolls for the lulz ) . 
  that depends on whether you talk about transylvania in the `` original '' sense , or in the broad sense , meaning all lands that belonged to hungary before wwi . 
  the core part is only about 57,000 km ^ 2 [ map ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:transylvaniaproper.png ), 
   more deportations nope . 
  crimes have no effect on refugee status . 
  they may be locked up in german prisons , but do n't get deported . 
  where to , anyway ? 
  to a war zone in syria ? 
  to unsafe countries ? 
  calais . 
  i see .
