  you know , closed trains . 
  a so called `` corridor '' . 
  just passing by , not even officially entering hungary , basically . 
  the main r\u00f6szke m5 motorway border crossing was closed for a few days because migrants were camping there . 
  serbia transported them away and then it was opened as well . 
  it 's open for refugees . 
  there are legal designated points of entry for asylum seekers to apply for hungarian asylum . 
  maybe if your pm had n't thrown shit at hungary and serbia , boasting that croatia would handle everything much better , then we could cooperate in building a fence around croatia , too . 
  [ how about going around the mountains ? 
  great question . 
  the proper way is to go the [ doors designated for this ] ( http://vs.hu/i/dsoki20150915220-2000-jpg.exact679x452.jpg ) . 
  there they can apply for asylum . 
  `` finding a solution in the middle east '' , oh my . 
  that place is a huge mess of a million conflicts , it 's not like `` please make peace guys '' . 
  europe could join the war there and then try to force things to be more stable , but we do n't have either the armies or the national interests to go to war there . 
  why does europe have to solve the middle east 's conflict ? 
  okay , maybe france and the uk , but what does hungary have to do with the conflict in the middle east ? 
  i 'm happy that hungary is not waiting for some nebulous `` other way '' from the eu . 
  we need to act now , there are 10,000 people entering per day !, 
  only a physical barrier can stop it on the short term . 
  better start it then . 
  look , in the broad context of history , a country that can not keep order at its borders will lose control of those territories . 
  seriously . 
  if they ca n't fence up dalmatia , then fence up slavonia . 
  or find * some * way to still fence up dalmatia . 
  doing * nothing * will definitely not solve it . 
  oh , the question is not whether they will get to germany or not !, 
  they will find a route for sure . 
  but at least hungary ca n't be blamed for it . 
  even if the whole south eastern europe is fenced up , they will maybe sail to germany from the north sea !, 
  this is what we are saying . 
  fence that shit up and protect the borders as it has to be done by a continent where laws mean something . 
  the proper term for these stats would be `` illegal immigrants caught by police '' . 
  oh , austria is constantly emphasizing the importance of schengen , border control and dublin . 
  ( [ like this today ] ( http://www.bundeskanzleramt.at/site/cob__60564/6597/default.aspx ) ) but they do n't like the fence . 
  you know , just protect the border `` somehow '' , but not with a fence . 
  orb\u00e1n asked with nice words weeks ago `` please do n't come . '', 
  that 's too evil . 
  orb\u00e1n makes a fence , oh my !, 
  but still austria expects the laws to be abided by . 
  it just shows that there was no fence on the croatian border yet . 
  now it 's almost complete and can get activated any moment . 
  then if they go through romania and back to hungary , we will also fence that part . 
  you seem to be right . 
  [ austria says ] ( http://www.bundeskanzleramt.at/site/cob__60564/6597/default.aspx ) they expect schengen and dublin to be abided by and the fence is legally okay . 
  but erroneously they think the fence does n't work . 
  obviously it does on the serbian border and it will definitely also work on the croatian border . 
  once the fence on the croatian border is ready ( a few days ) , austria will have to make up its mind : either holding up the laws and then no more illegal migrants - or letting them to austria officially , legally . 
  only fanatic orb\u00e1n haters can not understand that this is a much larger scale issue than petty internal bickering . 
  well , [ even mszp voters ] ( http://index.hu/belfold/2015/09/24/az_mszp_uj_jelszava_menekultugyben_pozitiv_semlegesseg/ ) are now supporting his actions , so that the socialists have to change their stance . 
  but yeah , orb\u00e1n is the devil himself , so he can never be right . 
  greece does n't want to ask for help . 
  it ca n't be forced to ask for help , it 's a sovereign nation . 
  but it can be expelled from schengen or the eu for not controlling its borders . 
  then , without greece , a croatian-hungarian-romanian-bulgarian southern fence can be built . 
  yes the croatian fence will be long , but what else is there to do ? 
  if croatia does n't want a fence , then it will be on the slovenian border and croatia will be flooded with stuck migrants , etc. 
  because it 's a massive violation of the schengen treaty to let unknown people without any documents enter in * massive crowds * . 
  many countries signed the schengen treaty and we are obliged to abide by it . 
  not just germany or sweden , many countries made an agreement . 
  also , there is no legal way for people who are not welcome by austria to just pass through . 
  the current status quo is illegal , therefore the construction of the fence . 
  and no , austria/germany saying it unofficially that they `` welcome '' migrants is not an official legal statement . 
  the official legal way of welcoming someone is known as ** visa ** . 
  give them visa , and they can go there unhindered . 
  of course i do . 
  how does it contradict what i wrote ? 
  migrants . 
  read the article . 
  austria said : if hungary can only stop them with a fence , then they should rather be let through to austria . 
  this is illegal . 
  as cocojumbo123 says , plus i took the numbers by loading the monthly datasets and putting them in a spreadsheet manually . 
  the solution may come : [ austria is asking hungary to just let the migrants through the fenced borders and let them to austria ] ( http://www.kormany.hu/en/the-prime-minister/news/we-should-consider-letting-migrants-through-to-austria-and-germany ) i presume that as soon as austria gives official legal permission for migrants in serbia and croatia to travel to austria , hungary will let such transit buses and trains through . 
  then tell your government to keep them in croatia and care for them . 
  is croatia on fire ? 
  can it host a million refugees without starving everyone ? 
  yes . 
  so why do n't you keep them ? 
  why bus them immediately away ? 
  do n't ask me about what hungary does , i 'm asking you about croatia . 
  why does croatia do what it does ? 
  it 's not an answer to question me back about hungary . 
  actually this is what the austrian chancellor asked from hungary : if the only way to keep them out is with a fence , then rather bus them to austria . 
  read laws . 
  croatia does n't want to deal with migrants , despite the fact that they were very harsh in condemning hungary for how they deal with them . 
  now they collapsed and can not do anything else than to bus migrants from serbia to hungary through croatia . 
  croatia would like serbia to bus them directly to hungary . 
  but there 's a fence there and only legal entry or asylum seeking entry is allowed there , no uncontrolled illegal migration . 
  why is a fence a `` drastic measure '' ? 
  is it a drastic measure to lock your house door for the night ? 
  legal entry is still allowed , only illegal entry is n't . 
  at least nobody can now tell hungarians they are doing it wrong whatever they do . 
  now it will be clear that austria wants to let them in . 
  great . 
  meanwhile migrant numbers skyrocket and a new record of 10,000 entered yesterday to hungary . 
  this will end well . 
  yeah , still no border enforcement . 
  no eu-wide help for securing the greek border , no support for hungary 's fence . 
  but of course the migrants will peacefully go into a hot spot , at the other end of which they may be directed to romania or lithuania . 
  sure they will choose that , instead of crossing the unprotected borders directly to germany or sweden .
