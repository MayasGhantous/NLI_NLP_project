  that is my point . 
  being a distinct nation does n't mean they are unknown foreigners from faraway exotic lands . 
  it 's very hard to deport someone from germany if they are there and have a right for asylum . 
  you know , german constitution , eternity clause etc. 
  it 's even hard if they do n't have a right for asylum . 
  the only place to stop them is at the greek border . 
  i 'm pretty sure he does it as a kind of realpolitik . 
  just see what he said around 2007-2008 . 
  i think that was what he really thought and may still be thinking in the back of his mind . 
  his first government was totally pro-atlantic , pro-west , pro-nato , pro-eu etc. 
  i guess some facts and reports have changed his mind on what 's possible in the position of hungary . 
  as he recently said , we are historically in the germany-russia-turkey triangle and we have to navigate this system and avoid getting occupied or `` colonized '' . 
  it 's not really easy . 
  wtf ? 
  hungary has no claims whatsoever on any neighbors since the 1940s . 
  of course the 1848 revolutions and austria crushing it with russia in 1849 . 
  that was more than a 100 years back . 
  during the austria-hungary times , franz joseph i 's role was totally reinterpreted as a kind old figure and it was basically forgotten that he took part in crushing the 1848 revolution . 
  his wife , the queen consort elisabeth was a kind of celebrity and an admired woman . 
  there were a lot of germans living in hungary , buda-pest was a majority german city in the middle of the 19th century but it was still 15 % german in 1900 ( austrian was n't considered an ethnicity then ) . 
  the culture is inter-tangled with german-speaking culture . 
  see figures such as franz liszt . 
  see the huge amount of germanisms and calques in the hungarian language . 
  then hungary went through two world wars on the side of germany . 
  and you say hungarians were some far , unknown foreign aliens to germans/austrians ? 
  true , but i doubt most of the refugees were . 
  the kuk times after the 1867 compromise were among the most prosperous and peaceful parts of the austrian-hungarian coexistence and it 's basically seen as a golden age of modernization and development in hungarian history . 
  the coexistence of romanians , slovaks vs. hungarians is a very different issue and has nothing to do with this topic now . 
  no , because official application has limits and delays . 
  it means you have to stay in turkey and can not be sure when the limit is reached . 
  on the other hand , if you go to germany by yourself , you can be sure to get there . 
  we should create a big safe application camp in turkey and send any illegal migrants back there . 
  of course this needs turkey 's cooperation , which the eu would need to buy . 
  it 's not easy but europe must use its power in some way , the eu should n't be just the bitch of the world who just has to take it up all the way . 
  the eu is economically strong and should use its influence . 
  erm , what ? 
  just 38 years after the dissolution of austria-hungary , austria got culturally so far from hungary as germany from arab countries today ? 
  the `` large numbers '' is crucial too , along with the cultural difference . 
  14,000 christian central europeans in germany is very different than 1.5 million ( a * hundred * times more ! ), 
  middle eastern muslims . 
  if russia really seriously attacked ukrainian civilians , for example , then i 'd be all for letting a few thousand to hungary . 
  people still would n't like to have too many of them , but it would be much better accepted than people who attack and disregard police and riot their way through borders as far as they want . 
  edit : math, 
  that ca n't work . 
  there is automatically a preference , because if you `` just come '' then you are here . 
  if you wait there , you may or may not be allowed to come . 
  what we need is n't simply `` no preference to applications already in the eu '' , but the absolute impossibility to get asylum if they come illegally on their own , instead of going to the official application point in the turkish camp . 
  how did the revolutionaries turn communist in the mere 9 years of soviet occupation till 1956 ? 
  you mean they just hated r\u00e1kosi and stalin but they really liked the other parts of communism ? 
  not just western europe , though . 
  here are the highest numbers ( [ source ] ( http://www.natarch.hu/szemle/20023/soos.htm ) ) , as of june 30 , 1958 . 
  * usa 35,240 * canada 24,588 * austria 17,499 * germany 14,289 * switzerland 11,975 * france 10,237 * australia 9,663 * sweden 5,823 a big difference is that these hungarians waited for official permission in austria , did n't just force their way into their country of choice . 
  if they only got a place in argentina ( 915 ) or venezuela ( 677 ) or south africa ( 1315 ) then they started their new life there . 
  if someone was n't communist , then the '56 refugees from hungary . 
  it wo n't . 
  they all want to come now and not when europe potentially changes its mind about letting them in around spring . 
  they do n't swim in the sea , they use boats . 
  if you dress up warm enough , i do n't think your life is at risk . 
  they use ferry , trains , buses etc. 
  on most of their journey anyway . 
  it takes around a week to get to germany . 
  one week cold trip for a life in germany is a good deal for many . 
   we finally want a european solution for a european problem - and this fully according to the treaty on the functioning of the european union . 
  hungary would probably profit more than germany from such a solution what do you mean ? 
  what can hungary really do with its 0.7 % of the total eu gdp and about 1.4 % of eu population ? 
  do you think we can really contribute a lot ? 
  will it really make a difference whether we take 5,000 refugees ? 
  you are knocking on the wrong door . 
  try the uk . 
  they only want to take 20,000 over 5 years . 
  all this orban and jobbik thing is a ridiculously petty diversion of the real conversation about what the big countries should do and whether the borders should be protected or migrants indeed have the right to enter as they wish . 
  those are the real questions . 
  orban is a nobody on international level , he 's great for the role of the boogeyman for the media . 
  it 's ridiculous to think that a relatively poor country of less than 10 million is the important party in this crisis . 
  see , croatia is all pro-europe and pro-germany and pro-humanity in their rhetoric , and what does that do for them or for the eu ? 
  the migrants are still out in the cold and do n't have good supplies in croatia . 
  they still go to germany through croatia , and croatia wo n't be able to accommodate a significant portion of them anyway . 
  giving eastern europe a disproportionately high number of refugees ( the least skilled and most problematic ones ) plus some financial aid is surely the dream of western europe , but we will not allow that . 
  these are countries with a long history of oppressors and revolutions and we wo n't allow such a thing . 
  even if the west may crush us down like the soviets did , we will try to resist this . 
  the whole deal is about this . 
  we must act preemptively and stop any such effort in the beginnings or before . 
  that 's why it is absolutely important to channel the discussion to the important matter : border control . 
  see my other comment on article 31 . 
  that 's a decisive thing . 
  in hungary 's interpretation good cause and all this can be checked in a few hours in most cases by questioning things like whether they have applied for asylum in serbia , whether they are persecuted there for their race , ethnicity etc ( see art . 
  if they are n't persecuted by serbia , hungary does n't consider them refugees . 
  this is a central point in the legal argument , everything diverges from here depending on whether you agree with this or not . 
   directly is meant as without ending the flight = settling elsewhere before , and there is in addition the good cause . 
  i posted a quote from a comment here on the thread , other comments i read say about the same about this point . 
  this is an * extremely * important point . 
  if directly means not settling in a country in between , then you are right and germany really must accept every refugee from all around the world if they wish to live in germany . 
  `` the austrian high court has ruled art . 
  31 inapplicable to any refugee who has even transited through another country en route to austria . '',

  `` at the time it was drafted , this reference to article 1 meant that it applied only to events occurring before 1 january 1951 . 
  the ` coming directly ' phrase was inserted at the request of the french at a late stage because france was concerned that article 31 would apply to others who had no connection with the events occurring before january 1951 . 
  it is debatable how relevant the phrase is after the coming into force of the 1967 protocol which has removed this temporal limitation . '', 
  ( [ source ] ( http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.de/2014/07/penalising-refugees-when-should-cjeu.html ) ) this unclear phrasing seems to be a point of controversy . 
  in my interpretation , the clause is there to allow the fleeing refugee not to pay attention to the exact location of official border crossing points ( which may also be far away ) , when they are literally running for their lives and need to exit the country at the geometrically closest location to avoid having to spend any second longer than absolutely necessary in a country where their persecutors may find and kill them .
