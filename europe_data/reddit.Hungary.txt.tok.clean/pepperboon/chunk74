  so the young man goes first and then hopes to get the others over through family reunification . 
  yes , because there is better and preferential treatment for minors , and people want to get that as long as they are not blatantly obviously older than 18 . 
  but you 're now fucking over slovenia , who 's basically innocent in this whole deal . 
  germany is the one blocking the way for a sane solution , so they should deal with it until they admit that securing borders is not equal to fascism . 
  what do you `` register '' them for ? 
  by the dublin regulations , the first country has to do the actual asylum procedure . 
  there is no other `` registration '' . 
  maybe you call counting and questioning them as `` registering '' . 
   so basically i would say 99,99 % of asylum applicants in hungary will not stay in hungary ? 
  you can write that in the past tense . 
  so 99.7 % have already left , to be precise . 
  build open camps on the german border and take them there . 
  migrants will just walk over the non-fenced border . 
  or force/riot their way in . 
   also they are constantly threatening to close the border entirely which would then mean that we instantly have the chaos on our hands . 
  if germany indeed closes the border ( i.e. 
  builds a fence ) it 's good because it will indicate a total turn of rhetoric and hopefully they will support the idea of closing greece 's border with a joint force as well . 
  anyway , they should rather get stuck in austria than in slovenia . 
  austria is a much richer , larger and extremely pro-germany country . 
  germany-austria conflicts will be lot easier to solve , these countries basically act in total unison in this crisis . 
  i think until merkel officially says that the greek border must be defended by force and that illegal entry to europe can not be tolerated any more , until that moment germany is not in the position of setting limits . 
  austria should just take them to germany as fast as possible , just like all the other countries on the route . 
  if germany wants them , it 's fine . 
  if they do n't want them , they should say so loud and clear and firm . 
  but this is unacceptable that they encourage migration but then complain and create bottlenecks . 
  hungary expected this to happen at some point ( migrants getting stuck ) , so i 'm really happy we built that fence . 
  it is selfish , sure , but if the eu is paralyzed and mad , you have no other option than to be selfish and act in your own interest . 
  you seem not to understand that migrants are being transported by ( or with the support of ) governments , all over the balkan route . 
  the cause of the abrupt decline is that the croatian government now buses them to slovenia instead of hungary . 
  `` actual age '' is hard to find out if they do n't have any documents . 
  even a doctor ca n't quickly tell if you are 16 vs. 18.1 or 17.9 vs. 20 . 
  i 'm sure more complex medical procedures can find out your age more accurately ( hormones , bones etc. ), 
  but that would be more expensive . 
  so i 'm pretty sure it 's `` claimed age '' . 
  i try to stay away from online feminism debates , they are usually extremely low quality discussions . 
  for me the data indicates several things : * media coverage is skewed ( they show a lot more women and kids ) * family reunification will bring a lot more people * the route is risky so only the strong and fit ones try to make it , so it 's not very humanitarian of germany to make people do this , as this closes off the vulnerable groups . 
  they can cheer and welcome them , but it 's ironic that they first force them to undertake something that women ca n't seem to complete in higher numbers . 
  others would also say : * these fighting age men should stay and fight for their country ( i think the situation is more complicated there , there is no single side of `` their country '' and a side of the `` attacking enemy '' , this is a civil war with several internal and external parties , i can understand if someone wants to stay out of that shit and just live ) * the danger ca n't be that great if they are leaving their families at home ( if the trip is risky and too expensive , i 'd also just rather send one male instead of nobody and hope for family reunification ), 
  it says `` regisztr\u00e1ltunk mened\u00e9kk\u00e9r\u0151k\u00e9nt '' = '' ... we have registered as asylum applicants '' . 
  there is no separate registration and asylum application . 
  both refer to the same procedure . 
  and most people coming to hungary from serbia have been registered ( = have applied for asylum ) , but still almost all have left and so their legal procedures were cancelled/stopped , since they are not in hungary any more . 
  registration/asylum application is the full fingerprint etc. 
  thing . 
  before the fence was up , they could apply for asylum and disappear . 
  now that we have a fence , we have so called `` transit zones '' , which means that the asylum application is often decided in a matter of hours right at the border and you ca n't enter hungary before that . 
  in the vast majority of the cases the claim is rejected due to arriving through the border with a safe neighbor country of hungary . 
  they are then expelled . 
  so since the fence is up , most of them do n't apply for asylum any more . 
  there was a separate thing where police just counted them by gender , age and source country when they stepped off the bus at the border . 
  that was done with everyone , one can find such statistics under the description `` illegal immigrants caught '' and not `` asylum applicants registered '' . 
  and yes croatia does not register them , i know . 
  which was a point of major criticism and ridicule from hungary as the registration system collapsed in croatia after a day or two and after that it 's only transportation now . 
  it says `` the immigration office has registered x number of y as asylum applicants . '', 
  there is no separate `` registration '' and `` asylum application '' , it 's one and the same thing . 
  and yes , they are already out of hungary and most cases have been closed as the person can not be found any more . 
  no idea , i did n't add the flair , i guess a moderator did . 
  source of numbers : reply by interior minister to a question by an mp ( [ in hungarian ] ( http://www.parlament.hu/irom40/06505/06505-0001.pdf ) ) . 
  here 's the [ hungarian article ] ( http://index.hu/chart/2015/10/21/menedekkerok/ ) where i found it . 
  and what should serbia do , they are coming from macedonia . 
  but what should macedonia do , they are coming from greece . 
  but what should greece do , they are arriving at the islands ... 
   greece is n't the focal point any more . 
  migrants stay there a few days , the time it takes to get to the mainland and leave . 
  most of them are in the balkans now . 
  there is continuous influx from greece , every day new people . 
  there is no such thing as where `` the migrants '' are . 
  it 's a continuous stream of people . 
  it takes around a week to get from greece to germany . 
  they do n't walk , there are buses and trains transporting them , helped by the governments that naturally want to avoid a congestion inside their own countries . 
  words without a fence are just words . 
  maybe the word of germany is strong enough if * they * want to set a limit , but i doubt that slovenia can `` set a limit '' by simply saying so and having no physical barrier . 
  in hungary the liberals have governed together with the socialists in 1994-1998 and 2002-2009 and even at the 2014 election the liberals , socialists and many others participated as a single block . 
  we consider them all `` leftist '' . 
  the classic hungarian divide is between the `` left '' and the `` right '' , the latter having consisted the conservative/patriotic/nationalist parties of mdf ( governed 1990-1994 ) , fidesz-fkgp-kdnp ( 1998-2002 , 2010-present ) and recently jobbik . 
  this distinction is somewhat shifting , as the socialists are getting weaker and many new `` leftist '' parties have appeared , among them lmp who also oppose the socialists and they are kind of green-liberal . 
  the left-right divide in hungary has long historic roots in the intelligentsia , referred to as the `` n\u00e9pi-urb\u00e1nus ellent\u00e9t '' or `` popular vs. urban conflict '' among writers , reaching back to the 19th century , originally referring to whether the writer emphasized the issues of the common , poor villagers and peasants vs. the cosmopolitan and urban point of view . 
  in the early 20th century this distinction had a jewish vs antisemitic taint , some [ saying ] ( http://yivoencyclopedia.com/article.aspx/hungarian_literature ) that `` urb\u00e1nus '' became a code-word for `` jew '' among writers . 
  the point is , political terms are not universal between countries and ages . 
  every country has its own unique mix . 
  it depends on history , perceived position in the pecking order of countries etc. 
  for example smaller eastern european countries have an underdog type of `` do n't colonize us !, 
  stop international exploitation !, 
  '' - nationalism , while rich countries have a `` let 's colonize and exploit those barbarians , we are superior ! '' - nationalism . 
  leftists in rich countries are seen as the compassionate ones who care about the oppressed people far away , like in africa etc. , while in poorer countries - it 's all about self-perception - they are seen as conspirators against the own people who care more for international issues than domestic ones . 
  so for example seen from germany , fidesz uses many `` leftist '' elements in their politics , like taxing banks and being against the rule of international finance systems ( at least in rhetoric ) , playing the benign parenting state reducing utility bills by laws etc. 
  of course this is a very-very over-simplified cartoonish description , but at least the general thrust is somewhat like this . 
  in many languages the equivalent of `` survive '' means something more like `` survive some hardship after desperate struggle and lucky to be still alive '' . 
  i think the english `` survive '' is indeed more neutral and does n't have the same connotations . 
  still does n't mean a thing if muslims choose from a more restricted pool of names . 
  look for stats about religion , ethicity , whatever . 
  i 'm just saying this statistic is not useful because it is easily skewed severely by muslims choosing from fewer names . 
  i said all i can about this issue , read what i wrote , i have nothing more to say . 
  still not a reliable statistic . 
  it could well be that muslims are more conservative and choose from a small set of names , say 20 names , while others choose from a set of 200 names , leading to 10 times less `` clustering '' . 
  just saying that this is a bad stat to look at . 
  there certainly seems to be a `` new atheist '' `` movement '' in the us , basically dawkins , dennett , sam harris , hitchens , lawrence krauss etc. 
  but in europe , where atheism is pretty normal , it 's not such a big deal as in the us . 
  well , the problem is that international media does n't let these messages through . 
  the government is saying this every time .
