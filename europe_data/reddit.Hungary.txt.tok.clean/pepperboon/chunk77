  the people alive in slovakia in the 21st century , in the eu , in a world of modern european values . 
  do n't they all have a right for self-determination and unrestricted use of their native language ? 
  they are n't immigrants , they are the victims of newly drawn borders cutting through 80-90 % hungarian majority regions . 
  and their collective guilt is still a part of slovak law , confirmed just 8 years ago by parliament . 
  autonomy is a well-respected european legal instrument . 
  there are lots of fearmongerers among slovaks who make it seem as if it was equal to independence or secession , which is utterly ridiculous . 
  show me an area where hundreds of thousands of people of a different ethnicity than the state ethnicity live and do n't have autonomy , despite the fact that there are large areas with over 80 % of them . 
  yes , there were actions by hungarians in the 19th century that are n't up to modern standards , like trying to teach everyone hungarian and the pressure to assimilate . 
  the important thing is today . 
  history is taught in a very twisted way in slovakia . 
  let 's not start this discussion here , it would take very long time and comments are not really suited for this . 
  do n't you see how insane , how raging mad it is to let everyone in and * then * filter them and try to send back a part of them ? 
  it 's not going to work . 
  unless you force them out of the country with weapons , it 's not going to work . 
  they will protest , children will cry , women will cry and police will have to beat them out of the country . 
  germany will never do this . 
  you 'll simply get used to it and learn to see the good side , like no more population decline and the enriching cultural diversity . 
  you 'll learn to accommodate to the new situation . 
  10 % of slovakia are hungarians and unfortunately they are n't really respected by slovak politicians . 
  it 's a long story going back to the pre-wwi times . 
  a great chunk of hungarian majority territory was given to czechoslovakia after wwi by economic reasonings ( mainly the access to the danube ) . 
  hungarians were treated quite bad . 
  the benes decrees on the collective war guilt of the hungarians ( and germans ) are still valid and were confirmed in 2007 by the slovak parliament . 
  they also oppose wide use of the hungarian language in the southern , hungarian-majority areas , by the reasoning `` this is slovakia , you have to speak slovak '' . 
  of course the common slovak people living there are a lot better than the politicians , but still there is a collective national feeling in slovakia that pretty much defines itself in its anti-hungarianism . 
  we have so many neighbors , it 's hard to choose . 
  she never talked about protecting the borders . 
  her government only spoke about how it 's a great opportunity to balance out the demographic decline and they will be a good workforce for taxes etc. 
  she never said `` this process is harmful and must stop asap . 
  germany will do everything to stop this influx because it is harmful to europe . '', 
  no , germany did n't come out and say `` this is harmful and bad '' . 
  they just went on how there 's no limit , how migrants will be good workers and the diversity will be an enrichment , media showed clapping and cheering germans with balloons welcoming the migrants at train stations . 
  they used the word refugee for all migrants throughout politics and media . 
  the media condemned hungary for trying to protect its own borders and for trying to keep them from going to germany , making them register in hungary etc. 
  implying that hungary should just open its borders and let everyone to germany , * and * they announced that any syrian who reaches germany will not be sent back to hungary . 
  now you have 3 or 5 times as many `` syrians '' as in reality ... 
  a lot of people simply get a * sentiment * from the media about certain topics . 
  it 's pretty orwellian , but it 's possible for the media to smear up a vague picture about a country without any substantial claims . 
  if you then ask the viewers ( after sufficiently long time ) they wo n't be able to say exactly why they feel the way they feel , it 's just a gut feeling , like `` everyone knows that , it 's simply the way it is , it goes without saying '' . 
  link the videos . 
  really simple . 
  are you talking about the video where they threw the sandwiches to the back rows ? 
  because i 've seen such things in videos from nickelsdorf as well . 
  or are you talking about tear gassing the aggressive attackers who were throwing stones and bottles on the police ? 
  how do you imagine protecting a border then ? 
  if the intruder say `` i wan na go through '' then police has to step aside ? 
  or what does protection mean in your vocabulary ? 
  ask them with nice words and enjoy the rocks thrown on the police ? 
  yes , and instead of that they talked about the advantages like migrants will work and pay taxes for pensions and make up for the demographic decline . 
  they enter through greece . 
  and now we also have croatia on the route as an `` entrance '' to dublin-iii , can germany deport there ? 
  which are the countries where germany can deport people ? 
  how come that poor kosovars are sent back to kosovo ? 
  is the humanitarian care for poor people in kosovo so much better ? 
  how could you deport them to hungary if they are n't eligible for asylum in hungary in the first place ? 
  twist it however you will , germany invites and encourages them , then gives them asylum . 
  that 's their own decision to feel humanitarian . 
  they should rather help greece protect the eu schengen border with military etc. 
  and then , in a regulated way , take as many refugees from turkey etc as they wish , legally , by plane and train . 
  nope . 
  just applying the law . 
  if germany makes exceptions , that 's their thing . 
  there 's nothing to be pushed . 
  they are n't eligible for asylum , having come through safe countries . 
  if germany continues to invite them by lax rules , it 's their thing to take care of . 
  in fact , * they * are trying to push their problem on other countries by quota systems . 
  about the title : is n't the cdu itself `` on the right '' , as conservatives ? 
  your system is weird . 
  no written constitution , court decisions based on previous cases instead of written laws . 
  very weird , seen from the continent . 
  you ca n't force romania to take x refugees if they do n't want to . 
  the refugee conventions only talk about people who flee to your country directly from persecution . 
  not through safe countries . 
  the procedure should be : every country ( globally ) proposes a number and then refugees in countries around syria can apply for those places , the country then assesses the cases , and if approved they can go to that country . 
  but in practice , once they are in the schengen zone , they 'd all go to germany and other rich countries anyway . 
  the journey is so arduous and hard ( for the old , children , disabled etc ) because germany does n't want to receive them legally . 
  once they work themselves through half the world illegally , then they are welcome and applauded . 
  but otherwise they do n't get any help ( legal or transport ) to get to germany . 
  they encourage and motivate their journey , do n't give any help for their travel and then complain about how hard the journey is . 
  you know , they should just let them use direct trains and flights with visa . 
  but no they do n't do that . 
   is it hard to remember all country names in english , if english is n't your first language ? 
  it 's exactly like remembering any other words in english . 
  reuters clickbait ? 
  5 reasons why migrants avoid this one weird eu country !, 
  you would never guess which eu country these migrants avoid !, 
  yeah , i ca n't find any particular anti-hungarian statements from him at the moment ( like slota ) . 
  seems strange for a far-right slovak . 
   those thrive on human fears and insecurities and poverty , gypsies , hopelessness , feeling dismissed , etc. 
   right wing parties who now are harping about hungarians the slovak anti-hungarianist far-right kotleba already made an [ anti-immigrant speech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb4wghx_8_u ) * with a hungarian translator standing beside him * , in the hungarian-majority village of b\u0151s ( gabcikovo ) ... 
  we 'll make an eastern eu . 
  relevant part  ** stefan grobe ** : `` i have another quote . 
  you said in recent speech : ` europe 's goal has to be to make sure that the laws are never divorced from its sense of humanity ' . 
  how does that go with statements we have heard from some eastern european governments that basically said flatly -- no muslims ? ''  ** frans timmermans ** : `` if people flee because they are persecuted you are not going to ask them what their religion is or what the color of their skin is . 
  people who flee have a place in europe . 
  at the same time , i think sometimes a caricature is made of the situation in central and eastern europe . 
  these are not xenophobic racists societies , they are not . they are societies with a different history then ours . 
  they are not used yet to diversity in their society . 
  but , sooner or later , every society , and this is not linked to the eu , this is not linked to the refugee crisis , this is linked to globalization . 
  every society is becoming , in some way or form , a diverse society , and we better get used to that and we prepare our population for that .
