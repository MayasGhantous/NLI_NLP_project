  again he 's conflating so many things . 
  yes , refugees are not asked . 
  but you ca n't come from a safe country and automatically get asylum . 
  and as for diversity due to simply `` globalization '' , that has nothing to do with persecution . 
  each country will accept as many economic migrants as they wish . 
  people will vote for the parties that make the promises that people want . 
  if people do n't want immigrants , this guy ca n't force them . 
  it only depends on how many europe will accept and how long we keep the borders uncontrolled . 
  the supplies are basically limitless . 
   people sold their homes i hope it 's clear to everyone that it 's impossible to sell a house in a war zone . 
  so your remark may apply to the economic migrants , but it 's unrealistic for war refugees . 
  who would buy a house that could be bombed any day and where your family could be shot any night ? 
  his show about migrants . 
  what 's the difference between your own town and timisoara ( with regards to crossing streets ) ? 
  practice in hungary : you have to step on the curb , look at the cars . 
  if it 's not very dangerous , you make one step down . 
  car will probably not stop if there 's a `` gap '' behind it , better chance if there 's a continuous flow of cars . 
  still , the first one will probably not stop . 
  then you make more steps and check if the car is slowing down . 
  if yes , you cross in fast step because you 're afraid of being hit and embarrassed that you had to slow that poor car down . 
  also , pedestrians walk/run through crossings despite the red light , if there are no cars coming . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcw__zp5j5g&amp;t=15s practice in germany : you 're meters away from the crossing and the car in the opposite lane has already stopped . 
  also , pedestrians stop and wait at the red lights , even if there are no cars coming anywhere . 
  in hungarian we have one word for this , [ er\u0151szak ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/er%c5%91szak ) . 
  anyway , the austrian interior minister meant tear gassing people and said that we 'd see [ pictures like in macedonia earlier ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/11815852/macedonian-police-fire-tear-gas-to-drive-back-migrants-and-refugees-on-border.html ) . 
  state-approved things are called violence too , like in the phrase `` state [ monopoly on violence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monopoly_on_violence ) '' . 
  but really , it does n't matter , we can call it force or whatever . 
  neither english nor german is my native language , but they mean stuff like tear gassing people . 
  whether that 's force or violence is just a labeling question . 
  also germany says they will be good to balance the population decline and to fill open jobs , to pay taxes for pensions , and to enrich the local culture . 
  who said anything like that ? 
  we welcome austria building a fence , it 's just a bit strange after all the preaching . 
  if they start fighting the migrants back , we just close the border to croatia . 
  something we * wo n't * end up with is tens or hundreds of thousand migrants stuck in hungary because they ca n't go to austria . 
  that wo n't happen . 
  a fence towards romania is also being prepared . 
  slovakia is also preparing with a mobile fence towards hungary . 
  we need to prepare , because germany and austria may * suddenly * stop receiving them . 
  we ca n't trust them to keep their word and receive them limitless . 
  so we need to be prepared . 
  also , we do n't stop refugees , we stop illegal border crossers who try to cross irregularly over forests and fields , without papers . 
  there are places for official application for hungarian asylum . 
  yes , because they kept on preaching how it 's inhumane to have a fence and it 's like the iron curtain and it 's not according to european values and humanity and so on . 
  and if they do n't build a fence then it 's empty talk , there is no way to stop 5 to 10 thousand people daily if you have no fence . 
  mainly germany and sweden seem to want them . 
  at least on the level of politicians and their media , but some suggest that opinion polls also show that most people might want them , too . 
  i do n't have any specific opinion about that south park episode , i think it was pretty bland , without any particular insight or satire . 
  i ca n't even say anything positive or negative about it . 
  it was a silly episode . 
  i mean it showed that there are pc people , that there are `` fuck them all '' people , but there was no real conclusion . 
  also canadians basically have the same culture , and the creators , of course intentionally , did n't choose muslims or even mexicans . 
   threatening violence and warning that violence may happen are two different things . 
  no , they are the same . 
  to say , `` if x does y , then violence may happen ( from my side ) '' is precisely the formula of a `` threat '' . 
  threats are almost always conditional . 
  `` i 'm coming after you right now to attack you '' is not really a typical `` threat '' . 
  well , in one case hungary was ruled unsafe for a particular refugee . 
  but yeah , it 's decided individually . 
  on the other things we are in agreement . 
   people leaving hungary are not really refugees but that is semantics i guess . 
  nor are people leaving croatia . 
  you mean after leaving the eu , right ? 
  you are imagining things . 
  nobody said anything about anybody saying `` lets go fuck some people up outright '' . 
  she clearly threatened to use violence against refugees in keeping them out of the country . 
  of course not `` outright '' . 
  the interesting fact is that austria is prepared to fight back against * refugees * fleeing a country ( hungary ) that was ruled unsafe for refugees by an austrian court . 
  how humane is that ? 
  also , building a fence after preaching so long to hungary will be ridiculous . 
  but surely they will sell it somehow . 
  like , it 's a humane fence and humane tear gas and humane water cannons , as opposed to `` darkest times '' fence and `` darkest times '' tear gas in hungary . 
  hungary just does it for fun , but austria is sadly forced to do it , while their heart is still bleeding for the poor migrants . 
  they even spell it out explicitly . 
  my translation :  then there would be `` pictures like in macedonia '' , where tear gas was also used against refugees , everyone must be aware of that . 
   building a wall that 's a very important safety measure . 
  if austria stops receiving them , or starts to build a fence , we will be ahead of the situation . 
  this point may come , whatever they are saying now . 
  a responsible government can not believe them . 
  a fence is a solid object . 
  a word is a word . 
  there is a crisis and hungary * must * have the infrastructure to protect its own borders if the international context requires it at some point . 
  it 's absolutely utterly irrelevant what the media and the hypocritical politicians are saying now . 
  totally irrelevant . 
  meanwhile , if germany does n't take them from austria , austria threatens to keep migrants out of austria ( in hungary ) , even ~ ~ with violence ~ ~ by force ( tear gas etc. 
   `` it is not a crime to cross a border to seek asylum , '' the un high commissioner for refugees , antonio guterres , said in a statement . 
  he lies . 
   ### article 31 . 
  refugees unlawfully in the country of refuge  1 . 
  the contracting states shall not impose penalties , on account of their illegal entry or presence , on refugees who , ** coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1 ** , enter or are present in their territory without authorization , ** provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence ** . 
  is serbia a `` territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1 '' ? 
   ### article 1  a person who owing to a well-founded fear of ** being persecuted for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion ** , is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country ; or who , not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events , is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to return to it are they '' * persecuted * for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion '' in * serbia * ? 
  in a candidate for membership of the eu ? 
  is the eu considering to get serbia as a member , where their is racial etc. 
  persecution on a state level ? 
  second , did these people * present themselves without delay to the authorities * ? 
  third , did they show good cause for illegal entry ? 
  impossible , since there are official entry points and nobody was chasing them with guns to cross the border . 
  so , this guterres guy is simply lying . 
   also , it is named after gabcik yep , 710 villages and towns were renamed after slovak figures , by the slovaks after world war ii and getting these territories again ( in the summer of 1948 ) , in an attempt to erase their hungarian identity . 
  the villages have zero , zilch to do with the guys they were named after , but it was a big middle finger to the hungarians .
