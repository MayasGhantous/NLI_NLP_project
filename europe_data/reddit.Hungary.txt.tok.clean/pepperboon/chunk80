  not the human traffickers , not the migrants and nobody else . 
  she 's a politician , her words mean what the masses understand under her words . 
  of course there is a system to this kind of mentality , it 's not simple insanity . 
  the father is an authority figure as you say , and in this culture they are like almighty arbiters of who should do what in the family . 
  no questions , no debate or rational argumentation . 
  father says how it is right and virtuous and the daughter obeys . 
  if she does n't then it 's an extreme rebellion , it 's not like in western families . 
  yes , fgm and all the repressions of sexual pleasure are in place to control the family lines . 
  in many places of the world , parents decide who their children marry , from which family , class etc. 
  if they can just go around enjoying sex and - especially before contraception and due to forbidding contraception - risking getting pregnant , then they can ruin the father 's plan and can bring shame on them in the community . 
  this can have real economic consequences for their whole lives from then on in such cultures - being an outcast , if not more severely punished . 
  the fear of getting pregnant and ruining the family and marriage business management has basically become so extensive that it 's like paranoia . 
  it includes mutilating genitals , covering up skin , hair , face ; not letting women touch non-relative men , men having to move their gaze to the ground lest they be excited by the sight of a veiled woman , segregated lives etc. . . 
  it creates extreme tension in young men , and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that men ca n't control themselves . 
  for them an ankle , a shoulder or , god forbid , a knee causes sexuality overload . 
  but they have to repress this , no wonder they become explosive . 
  this father is just the product of a culture . 
  he 's simply doing what he was brought up for . 
  not all cultures are equivalent . 
  some cultures lead to this . 
  and of course not all muslims would do this , by far . 
  that 's why this is news and not an everyday thing . 
  but also , many daughters just quietly accept this . 
  the problem only comes if they are sufficiently westernized due to growing up in the west and having ties to peers from the free society . 
  this is also why this kind of parents would like if they do n't mingle too much with western people . 
  just to expand upon this , in hungary , people easily moved from voting for the socialists ( former communist state party ) to the far-right jobbik , especially in the north east of hungary ( poverty , unemployment , issues with gypsies ) . 
  previously they were nostalgic for the communist simplicity and order , now they protest by voting jobbik . 
  also fidesz , the governing party used the most populistic and demagogue campaign targeting the `` working man '' and the `` small man '' ( `` kisember '' ) , playing the role of the nurturing , parenting state , reducing the utility bills , holding the banks accountable etc. 
  i mean , they really did some of this , but this kind of propaganda looks also very left-wing from the outside . 
  or the fact that jobbik , the far-right party was pro-muslim till now due to their anti-israel stance in the middle east and basically zero muslim immigration until very recently . 
  they held up iran as a good example and they wanted to invite iranian observers to oversee the hungarian elections so there will be no cheating . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr-ez_22pi8 ) ( he 's saying `` this year i will write a letter to mahmoud ahmadinejad and they will come here from iran !, 
  and not the \u00c1vh ( former communist secret police - nickname of the police by the far-right under the socialist government back then ) will march on the streets but the iranian revolutionary guards ! '' ), 
  or here 's him [ supporting the palestinian arabs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlimfnujuou ) . 
  they are firmly anti-communist and anti-soviet but like russia and putin . 
  it 's like , every country has a unique mixture and it 's very intellectually lazy to just read off the label `` left '' , `` right '' , `` far right '' , `` conservative '' , `` liberal '' etc. 
  and support a party of a foreign country without knowing the context , the history and what parties actually represent and mean to the native population . 
  i do n't think it makes sense to talk about a universal `` left '' or `` right '' . 
  political sides are a lot more complicated than that . 
  the dividing lines are at different places in each country , based on history , culture , locally important and relevant issues and context . 
  what we call right-wing in e.g. 
  hungary is not the same as in other countries . 
  you ca n't really measure politics on a single axis . 
  hungary 's governing party likes a `` big government '' , lot of governmental redistribution ( they are basically socialists in this ) , but at the same time does n't want cheap economic migrants . 
  if it 's a richness , why does germany want to spread them out , why do n't they want as much richness to themselves as possible ? 
  i know germany is not equal to the un , but still , what 's the reason ? 
  oh we are !, 
  people also like fried blood . 
  it 's one of the main dishes at a pig slaughter . 
  blood sausage is also a huge thing in hungary . 
  maybe they were just clumsy . 
  many of the most popular hungarian surnames are names of nationalities : magyar ( hungarian ) , t\u00f3th ( slovak ) , n\u00e9meth ( german ) , horv\u00e1th ( croat ) , r\u00e1cz ( serb ) , ol\u00e1h ( romanian ) , lengyel ( pole ) , orosz ( russian ) , t\u00f6r\u00f6k ( turk ) . 
  not paying attention then . 
  also there are many more . 
  yes , `` ol\u00e1h '' is an archaic word for romanian . 
  it 's also a popular hungarian surname . 
  same origin as `` olasz '' or for that matter `` vlach '' . 
  in hungarian ` italian ' is ` olasz ' and ` italy ' is ` olaszorsz\u00e1g ' . 
  same origin as w\u0142ochy . 
  an archaic alternative is `` talj\u00e1n '' for italian . 
  how ? 
  how do you physically stop them ? 
  with violence ? 
  okay , if germans want to try this , let them . 
  i mean , there is nothing objectively wrong with having parallel societies and isolated communities . 
  nobody can be forced to have german friends or to go outside of one 's community . 
  it depends on one 's point of view . 
  you could even say that germans entering such communities are provocative and should let them live by their own customs and rules without shocking them with things like gays , female skin etc. 
  because you know there are already homophobes in europe , and we do n't deport them , so why should it be different with migrants . 
  everything can be twisted like this . 
  acceptance ( i.e. 
  not attacking violently ) is a strange definition of `` integration '' . 
  i 'm reflecting a lot . 
  but you have to see . 
  a fence would be `` darkest times '' . 
  if migrants riot and attack the police then it 's `` children were tear gassed '' . 
  how can germany retreat from this and say `` no , you , dear mister , ca n't come '' ? 
  how ? 
  by asking nicely ? 
  by `` fixing '' the middle east ? 
  without any sarcasm , i think germany * will * find a way to manage it . 
  the `` finite capacity '' of germany is up to 10 million i think . 
  could be even more if they get more organized . 
  a few million migrants is still not very much in a rich country of 82 million . 
  there will be problems but it wo n't be like the armageddon . 
  how ? 
  do you ask them `` are you an extremist and will you be violent towards christians ? '', 
  heresy !, 
  everyone knows there are no limits to asylum in germany and that germany will manage this !, 
  also keeping them out would be like the darkest times . 
  sure , but a fraction of a few million is still a big number . 
  it wo n't be easy . 
  most of them quickly leave the country towards austria . 
  they do n't wait till the end of the asylum process and the case is dropped as the guy ca n't be found in his assigned refugee camp any more . 
  if you mean approvals at the new `` transit zones '' right at the border , i do n't know about any approvals there . 
  but there are cases still in progress . 
  if they are really persecuted due to their race etc. 
  in serbia/croatia , they will get asylum by law . 
  he was referring to the internet meme `` hitler did nothing wrong '' . 
  we have a saying in hungary : if my grandma had a current collector , she 'd be a tram .
