  it 's a human rights thing . 
  sending people to war zones will not happen . 
  no point in discussing this . 
  the current laws do n't allow such a thing and there is no will to change it . 
  that 's the situation . 
  of course germany `` can '' do anything , they can even introduce a dictatorship if you mean they `` can '' make totally new laws and change everything . 
  yes , in that sense they `` can '' deport people to war zones . 
  germany will never forcefully deport people to war zones . 
  forget it . 
  because it 's against the law . 
  you can lock them up in prison if they do something to warrant that , but you ca n't send them back to unsafe countries . 
  good luck trying to `` integrate '' violent bigoted religious extremists . 
  above the age of around 15-16 , the personality development is basically finished . 
  if they were indoctrinated to this , you wo n't be able to override it by sending them to a weekly ( or even daily ) integration course where someone preaches about acceptance of infidels , gays and miniskirts and premarital sex . 
  maybe they will understand the dry facts about what is accepted in europe but how many will deeply understand it and agree with it ? 
  but keeping them out reminds us of the darkest times ( fences etc ) , so they will go unhindered . 
  current main cover article of die welt : [ police wants to separate refugees by religion ] ( http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article146926095/polizei-will-fluechtlinge-nach-religion-trennen.html ) good luck germany . 
  this is just scratching the surface . 
  it 's only been a few hundred thousand migrants and it will be millions . 
  you need to segregate muslims ? 
  how does that fit with the german ideology ? 
  do you assume that a muslim , just by being muslim , is a threat to the christians ? 
  i do n't think germans would accept this kind of segregation as it generalizes . 
  and of course , what will happen in real life outside ? 
  will they build muslim-only settlements so that the christians are safe from them ? 
  if not , then why do we need to segregate refugee camps ? 
  because of the density of people ? 
  what is the person per sqare meter density where muslim segregation is a necessary safety measure ? 
  it does n't mean they `` do n't use it '' at all . 
  by the way the hungarian government uses it sparingly too . 
  it 's defined in some laws where it 's mandatory , but outside that it 's usually not used . 
  there are many such coats of arms in hungary .

  we do n't have halloween here , just halloween themed parties in the bigger cities . 
  kids do n't ask for candies , it 's not a thing . 
  and i 'm happy that this is the case . 
  we have our carnival in the spring . 
  there is a certain push towards it , like with valentine 's day or santa claus at christmas , because it 's in the movies and it 's so cool because it 's american . 
  perhaps thanksgiving will also be marketed to us in some years ... why should all countries celebrate the same american stuff ? 
  there are so many different european traditions , why is uniformization so good ? 
  there are some middle aged ( 30-55 ) people too , but tourists do n't randomly meet them . 
  shop assistants , bus drivers and others that tourists do meet ( except for the tourism industry itself ) are usually the low-paid people who do n't speak english ( if they had better education , they could have better jobs ) . 
  not really . 
  in primary school the great majority of children only learn one foreign language and that 's english , but some learn german or french instead ( or very rarely something else ) . 
  then in secondary school they learn two foreign languages , one of which is english , the other typically german/french/spanish / italian/russian/latin . 
  so quite many learn german , but i 'd say english is still more popular . 
  how did they determine that hungary has `` high proficiency '' in english ? 
  last time we had a map ( [ thread with 1000 + comments ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27oxbk/percentage_of_people_in_the_eu_being_able_to_hold/ ) - from 2 years ago , but it keeps popping up repeatedly ) where we were the very last country in the percentage of english-speakers at 20 % ( below spain with 22 % ) . 
  facebook bought whatsapp for $ 19 billion for a reason . 
  its sole purpose is gathering data . 
  that 's the entire purpose of the existence of this app . 
  it 's not some small extra thing you can just cut off . 
  it 's also very difficult to prove how they handle the data . 
  especially in the us , there is a flavor of atheism which is more like anti-theism ( as a response to a high influence of religion in public discourse ) . 
  these are people who spend a great amount of time debating and discussing religion and how they do n't believe in it and how religions are wrong . 
  this is quite different from the atheism of those who simply do n't have a religion and do n't care about the whole topic . 
  if there were people who learn and read a great deal about stamps , and who come together and discuss how much they do n't collect stamps , then i 'd consider them a distinct group from people who simply do n't happen to collect stamps . 
  nobody mentioned specifically austria . 
  hungary has similar prices to germany . 
  the dutch and belgian supermarkets i 've been to were n't much more expensive either . 
  i do n't remember exactly , but for the purposes of this discussion i do n't consider 20 % -25 % to be `` much '' . 
  and clothes are usually sold for almost the exact same price from chain stores ( the price tag often shows the price in all countries , so you can compare ) . 
  the point i was making is that hungarians/polish etc. 
  can only afford to buy much less stuff with their salaries . 
  the cost of living is only a bit lower , while the salaries are vastly lower ( the difference is 4-10 * times * depending on the job , not some percentages ) . 
  but in fact those things are n't much cheaper either . 
   unprocessed food is much cheaper . 
  except for germany . 
  german discounters like aldi and lidl are really cheap . 
  even cheaper than hungary in many cases . 
  cost of living is not much lower in hungary , if we talk about stuff that people earning $ 500 can afford . 
  food , clothes , petrol , electronics cost pretty much the same or even higher in hungary due to our record high vat . 
  rent and restaurants are cheaper , but not much else . 
  in many countries , like my own hungary , politics is quite a dirty business of power , almost military-style obedience/dominance , money-chasing etc. 
  which are more associated with masculinity . 
  people who seek this kind of job are more often men than women . 
  women usually have less craving for such power . 
  my guess is that icelandic politics is probably less cut-throat agressive and is more about a sane discussion of actual issues and policy . 
  if you look at the [ actual scores ] ( http://www.savethechildren.org/atf/cf/%7b9def2ebe-10ae-432c-9bd0-df91d2eba74a%7d/every%20last%20girl%20report%20final.pdf ) ( on page 24 as marked in the corner ) , for the top countries it 's mostly a comparison of the number of female members of parliament in each country . 
  which i think is not really a measure of girls ' quality of life . 
  of course , i should have made it more clear . 
  it 's a real medieval legend on the origin of hungarians . 
  but it was debunked already in the 19th century i think . 
  yeah , they say we should be proud that we are `` attila 's grandchildren '' ( attila unok\u00e1i ) . 
  they also named their nationalist '' `` university '' '' king attila folk college ( not an actual uni of course ) . 
  she already [ said this in 2012 ] ( http://www.jpost.com/jewish-world/jewish-news/marine-le-pen-wearing-kippot-should-be-banned ) . 
  why ? 
  the very fact of not closing the borders and not trying to stop people from illegally entering germany and the schengen zone is/was itself an invitation . 
  germany willingly took in the migrants and accepted them as refugees despite not being the first safe country . 
  this happened by germany 's will and can be considered an invitation . 
  this kind of `` invitation '' is much broader than those 3 things . 
  it 's the whole pull effect . 
  when people say germany/merkel invited the migrants they mean all these things . 
  the fact that they are taken in , not deported , that germany was against erecting fences , that they give welfare to the migrants , that they talk about how migrants will help with an aging society and how they will raise the gdp , enrich the culture etc. 
  these all create an atmosphere that says that germany wants these people to come . 
  this kind of atmosphere was already there before august/september 2015 , that 's why so many migrants had germany as their destination . 
  because they heard from other people that the conditions are so good and that they are wanted there . 
  this was taken as an invitation . 
  at least when i use the word `` invitation '' in this context , i do n't mean one specific tv speech of merkel or something like that .
