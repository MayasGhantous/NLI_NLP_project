  and titling articles like `` here 's [ thing ] '' instead of [ thing ] . 
  like `` here 's why obama is [ verb ] ing [ noun ] '' . 
  or excessive use of `` this '' . 
  it 's like begging for a click , like `` come on , there is this stuff here beyond this click , you know you want it , it 's just a click away , it 's already waiting for you '' . 
  exactly . 
  but people treat it as if it was some public service and then get surprised . 
  we should trust and rely on fb a lot less . 
  but if you say this , it 's shot down like you 're some conspiracy nutjob . 
  letting a single private company control so much of our communication and information sharing is a big mistake . 
  ah , of course , that 's right . 
  the eu federalists probably see it just as a first step to a more global unification . 
  that 's why a true european identity ( or `` euro-nationalism '' ) is not really pursued very strongly by anyone . 
  it 's either a `` world citizen '' or a `` national '' identity i think . 
  now of course there are some who feel european first and foremost , but i think it 's rare . 
  we were already sour and melancholic before trianon . 
  it 's a historical thing , but it 's improving . 
  well , erasmus and eurovision . 
  and i guess a start is that i see `` european '' being used more and more as a positive adjective , mainly by politicians . 
  this is european , that 's un-european , we need more europe ( ** claps , claps ** ) , european values . 
  i see this a lot in germany . 
  `` europa '' is used similarly to `` democracy '' etc. 
  but i guess building a european identity is difficult because the people who oppose the nationalism of their own countries will rather think of themselves as world citizens , because you know why arbitrarily exclude other regions . 
   electronic voting without open software [ e-voting is a terrible idea with or without free software . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oadmi ) . 
  you as a citizen can not verify what runs on the actual hardware , it has lots of potential for manipulation . 
  there 's no way to verify the results the same way you can re-count the physical ballots . 
  everyday people can see and confirm the number of ballots , but it needs extremely high skills to verify the e-voting infrastructure , you could practically call it impossible . 
  this is n't a good argument to an internationalist . 
  they 'd say it 's not a big deal if that country did n't exist , we should strive for more and more unification , culminating perhaps in some utopic world government . 
   rather than affection for the eu as a whole . 
  because there is no eu identity . 
  but there are efforts to create it now artificially . 
  the closest europe used to have that somewhat united the continent was the christian identity . 
  ( and yeah , many national identities were also created somewhat ` artificially ' to a certain degree in the 18th-19th centuries ), 
  it 's * improving drastically * !, 
  it was about twice as high in 1990 compared to today . 
  but it 's a combination of stress , alcoholism , hopelessness , bad mental care , fatalist thinking etc. 
  oh or watch this [ bbc hardtalk interview with the hungarian foreign minister ] ( http://indavideo.hu/video/hardtalk_-_peter_szijjarto&amp;token=e5jrg34lnnb9n4hsois3b9edi2 ) . 
  i wonder if they will say the uk is now betraying european values . 
  or will the bbc have news stories told in an [ ominous voice like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbfvtt6rgz0 ) from the factories where they produce the wall/fence elements ? 
  or that the wall 's message is `` stay away , you 're not welcome here '' . 
  i also wonder how the hungarian opposition will put a spin on this story , because for them the uk is this paradise where everything is done right and where their supporters dream of escaping from this `` fascist regime '' . 
  same thing that i thought . 
  i wonder if there will be a huge media outrage , whether tv moderators all around the world will be horrified about the darkest times coming back , about building new iron curtains in the middle of europe etc. 
   they certainly did n't take words from any turkic language . 
  according to historical linguists they did . 
  but perhaps you 're a bigger expert . 
  it is turkic according to the etymological dictionary ( zaicz , 2006 ) . 
  according to my dictionary of etymology , it 's probably an earlier loanword , so it comes from the semi-nomadic times , before the hungarian conquest of the carpathian basin in 895 . 
  actually , we did n't borrow too many words from turkish in the ottoman era , except for words like `` minaret '' , `` dzs\u00e1mi '' ( central mosque ) , `` mecset '' ( mosque ) , `` janics\u00e1r '' ( janissary ) etc. 
  there was n't much language exchange between hungarian common people and the occupying turks . 
  all the basic words of turkic origin ( like `` alma '' for apple , compare turkish `` elma '' ) come from much earlier . 
  none of the listed countries were in the soviet union . 
  they also were n't communists in either 1938 , 1990 or 2016 ( 1990 can be considered transitionary , but even then you can estimate the gdp , as people have actually done ) . 
  also , how exactly would ppp help here ? 
  i replied to a comment that suggested using ppp . 
  if gdp is guesswork , then gdp ppp is at least as much guesswork . 
  read that comment again to understand how he got the final number . 
  hint : also read the first part . 
  gdp is a valid measure . 
  it does n't show exactly how `` well-off '' people are , but it shows the economic size/strength of the country . 
  it 's 1990 $ in op 's picture . 
  so the value of the usd in 1990 is considered , so inflation does n't distort the comparison . 
  horthy was n't fascist , come on ... 
  the bosnian war only took a few years . 
  they have n't properly settled into germany over that time . 
  also , most migrants/refugees are not from syria , just 25-50 % depending on how you calculate it . 
  also , there are several times more refugees arriving ( more than a million just in 2015 ) than the bosnians ( about 300,000 ) . 
  it will be a lot harder to deport them . . 
  will they shove crying families in trains ? 
  families where kids have been born in germany , speak german and go to german schools ? 
  hundreds of thousands of them ? 
  the bigger problem is that i do n't know of any nation wants to take on this role . 
   taking care of migrants can also be done here , but it would be more ** expensive and grow our gdp ** in the north and increase the imbalance . 
  so is it a net expense or profit ? 
   in southern europe  but that would be too cheap and solve our problems yeah , * your * problems . 
  what about creating problems for southern europeans ? 
   yeah , but you got ta send them back at some point . 
  i think that 's a pipe dream . 
  once you have a new generation born in germany , there 's no way you can expel/deport/kick out hundreds of thousands or even * millions * of people from germany . 
  picture it : the kid speaks german , goes to a german school , he cries and holds onto his mother 's skirt , who is also crying and the german police is shoving them and * hundreds of thousands of others like them * in trains headed to a devastated and destroyed land . 
  pictures all over the international media . 
  this will * never ever * happen . 
  the migrants will stay . 
  the only question is how much they will integrate . 
  this is the part germany should concentrate on , not dreaming about how they might leave one they because they wo n't . 
   but i presume that takes at least 5 years ? 
  are you implying that you expect peace in syria and safe-for-deporting conditions in less than 5 years ? 
  the balkan war was over in a few years . 
  that 's a very different situation . 
  the middle east has been at war for decades . 
  there 's basically no hope for stability there . 
  a new generation will grow up in germany and they will not want to move to a destroyed country . 
  also , why would germans want to send them away ? 
  i thought germany was aging and they need the migrants as workers and they will bring new economic and cultural vitality to europe . 
  interesting . 
  in hungary , we only have them if there 's no railing on the side of the road ( [ example ] ( https://www.google.hu/maps/@47.4018751,18.8707866,3a,75y,252.98h,60.03t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s6radtvugzq5jlvwunxrcjw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) ) . 
  what markers are we talking about ? 
  if you mean those small white poles in the ground , those are n't there in all places . 
   okay , so `` paprika '' hungarian word , from uralic root ... 
  it 's true that it spread from hungarian , but even in hungarian it 's a loan word from south slavic languages .
