  the word is cognate to the word `` pepper '' ( note the p-p-r ) . 
  in any case it 's a minority who 's from syria . 
  so even if the syrian conflict is solved in a few years ( will it really be ? ), 
  and all are kicked out of germany ( you do n't seriously believe that they will * want * to return to that devastated country after having settled and got used to living in germany ... ) , so even if they magically all go back to syria , you still have a lot more people from elsewhere . 
  do you think the whole middle eastern mess will be solved in a few years ( syria , iraq , afghanistan ) ? 
  afghanistan has been at war since the seventies . 
  [ here 's a german news from last year ] ( http://www.n-tv.de/politik/anfrage-bringt-de-maiziere-in-verlegenheit-article16471496.html ) it says 243,721 out of 758,473 were from syria ( 32 % ) , but according to the minister of interior possibly a third of those were fake syrians ( so according to him just 21 % were actual syrians ) . 
  he later could n't prove this , but it 's very hard to determine who is from where , since they have no documents , the statistic is most probably whatever they claim ( which is of course syria , as that gives them the highest chance for staying ) . 
  maybe more were syrians this year , i do n't know . 
  still , the point is they will never return . 
  the problems : * most migrants are n't from syria or a war zone . 
  they are from bad places , but not from a particular war where you can say that `` it has now ended '' at any point . 
  * if we just talk about the war like the syrian civil war , it can easily take another 10-20 years . 
  then you have a destroyed country where nobody will want to return . 
  the migrants will already have had children who were born in germany , they will be going to german schools , speak the language etc. 
  do you think germany will then deport these families to a country that 's destroyed to the ground ? 
  can you really imagine ? 
  they will * never * return and everyone knows this . 
  it would be pretty stupid to build a massive fence that just stops a few kilometers from the main arriving area of migrants . 
  they can just go around it ... 
  i hope the fence will be continued for some part of the romanian border . 
  obviously no need to build it until the ukrainian border , but some reasonable distance . 
  technically , she never said that they should come . 
  she just said that all are welcome who reach germany . 
  so she technically never actually encouraged them to come , she just said that * given * that they are already there , they should be welcomed . 
  which is basically the same , but germans always like to point out this difference to argue that she did n't actually * invite * them . 
  we take back all people who entered the eu through hungary . 
  these are mostly the people from kosovo and albania . 
  and we do take them back from austria . 
  if you have problems with people from the middle east , then talk about that with greece , because that 's where they entered the eu . 
  just because the greeks did n't register them it does n't mean it 's hungary 's responsibility . 
  strange how people ca n't remember things at one year 's distance . 
  so let me remind you : we kept them from going to germany , the police even closed the main railway station of budapest and the govt stopped all international train traffic so they nobody could travel west without authorization ( i.e. 
  pass/visa etc. ), 
  the media was full of pictures with people ` stranded ' in front of this train station and we were called all the bad words for not letting them go . 
  there were even average people from austria and germany who , upon seeing these news , jumped in their cars and came to budapest to illegally transport migrants to austria/germany . 
  then eventually merkel said that germany will let them in ( after thousands of migrants started * walking * towards austria on the motorway ) , so then they were allowed to get on the trains . 
  yes . 
  but some people claim it 's not in ` the spirit ' of human rights conventions , because anyone who has a poor life at home should have the right to live in the european country of their choice . 
  they believe that if someone illegally crosses 5-10 borders between safe countries to go to their desired country , they should still count as refugees and be accepted . 
  the hungarian govt says that 's not so and people only have the human right to flee out of a conflict area , not to a particular european country of their choice ( which is never hungary , anyway ) . 
  well it did start with this , i.e. 
  it was the event from which historians count wwi , but it does n't mean it was the real reason . 
  it 's basically a legendary , fake reason . 
  is that what they really taught in your history class ? 
  that assassination was just the ` casus belli ' . 
  it was definitely not the real underlying cause . 
  wars are not fought for such things , this is not a movie or a greek legend . 
  there are always real interests behind . 
  should hungary solve the conflict in the middle east and the poverty of the third world ? 
  you blame hungary for wwi ? 
  wtf ... 
   has there even been any data on what those fences have cost so far and will cost in the future ? 
  converted , about 40 million eur so far ( [ source in hungarian ] ( http://index.hu/belfold/2016/08/26/harmas_kerites_lesz_a_magyar_hatarnal_mint_a_spanyoloknak/ ) ) . 
  the current fence was built very quickly last year ( at a pace of about 10 km/day ) . 
  it 's not really strong , just poles and some fence net on it ( [ picture ] ( http://24.p3k.hu/app/uploads/2015/07/hatarzar-keritese0d244d3-757d-4185-a2f1-120e788b12b3.jpg ) ) . 
  it 's quite easy to cut through ( although the stricter laws make it less attractive to break through ) . 
  but if turkey stops keeping the migrants out of europe , there might be a need for a stronger fence that can stop a larger mass of people . 
  at least that 's orb\u00e1n 's reasoning . 
  this is ridiculous . 
  police should clear the area , cut down and transport away all the bushes and trees , install bright reflectors and watchtowers along the road and protect people who try to pass through this road . 
  yeah , but slovakia is somewhat different . 
  10 % of the country 's population are hungarians and the southern areas are above 80 % + hungarian , so it 's more significant than danes in germany . 
  i 've never heard of this . 
  i do n't even know what it 's called in hungarian . 
  it also would n't have much sense to have it as a holiday in hungary since we have august 20 off already as a national holiday . 
  why ca n't they correct the speed ? 
  it 's so annoying with old films . 
  it 's so simple to do it in video editing software . 
  your comment remains true if we replace `` poland '' with `` hungary '' . 
  same situation , really . 
  ah so you mean actual swimming at the beach . 
  i imagined just taking a walk there . 
  i 'm not sure if mediterranean old people really swim that much . 
  lot of old people go to the market every morning . 
   the double german-hungarian citizen he only had hungarian citizenship ( early news were corrected later ) . 
  and he was gypsy by ethnicity ( whom the far-right also does n't like ) . 
  the hungarian exam is similar . 
  [ here 's the english version from this year ] ( http://dload.oktatas.educatio.hu/erettsegi/feladatok_2016tavasz_emelt/e_tortang_16maj_fl.pdf ), 
   hungary has as many gipsy as we do , in half the size land area and population romania has approx . 
  double the absolute number . 
  if we go by the censuses then there are 621,573 roma people in romania and 315,583 in hungary . 
  the real figures are probably higher , but probably that 's a similar factor in both countries . 
  so it 's only similar between romania and hungary if you take the percentage . 
  first one is centered on menton , france and shows monaco on the left side . 
   africa population is expected to reach a billion in the next 25-30 years not * reach * ( it 's already over 1.2 billion ) , but it will * increase by * a billion in about that time . 
  german media shoves this interpretation down people 's throat . 
  i 've watched german tv ( mostly zdf and das erste ) and read magazines ( spiegel ) and newspapers ( zeit , frankfurter allgemeine ) for some years now and the `` eu = europe = family = good '' idea is pushed very strongly on an emotional level . 
  many people eat it up without any critical thought that maybe if someone criticizes the way eu institutions work , they might still not want to start world war 3 . 
  here 's an example from hungary : https://youtu.be/qkp7zaxjrfy?t=3m it burns but not easily . 
  yeah , a `` united front '' consisting of the former socialist prime ministers ... 
  the same guys that were crushed by voters in 2010 . 
  the same gyurcs\u00e1ny who ordered the beating of protesters in 2006 . 
  most people will never vote for him again . 
  only the most loyal pensioners . 
  it 's very subjective and hard to compare across countries with very different history , wealth etc. 
  i 'd say 1998 fidesz also does n't fit the description.perhaps not even up to sometime in the 2010s . 
  hungary is misrepresented here , several right-wing parties are not colored red . 
  mi\u00c9p for example is ( was , when they existed ) definitely right-wing , so is/was fkgp and kdnp . 
  [ here 's my corrected version with the 1990 and 1994 elections also shown ] ( http://imgur.com/kefbev7 ) this `` sudden increasing trend '' is not as strong when you look at the real data .
