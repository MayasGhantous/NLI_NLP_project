  because they are poor asylum seekers and are too traumatized to find the official entry points . 
   i criticize other things - in particular the anti-liberal and anti-european behavior/statements of orban that 's not relevant here . 
  we are talking about the migration crisis now . 
  just because you hate someone for some political opinions , you do n't get to denounce every action of the country . 
   and sure the outer borders of the eu must be secured . 
  what many people here complain about , including me , is how this is done , not that it is done - this is necessary . 
  and what 's the problem with the way it 's done ? 
  that it looks bad when seen on german tv ? 
   what should n't be forgotten is that hungary is also not the first country they enter schengen for the first time , but in most cases greece . 
  and for the situation that refugees get stranded in greece or in eastern europe inside or outside schengen is something you could blame germany and the other `` inner-schengen '' countries for ( and to a smaller part also hungary ) , for insisting on dublin-iii for much too long , without helping to find a workable and humane solution . 
  this problem did n't start yesterday , but years ago , and it gained much momentum in spring - so we knew at least since february that it 'll get much worse for many different reasons , the unhcr even warned about exactly the situation we have now for 2015 already in 2013 . 
  that 's right . 
  the inner eu powers did n't care about it until the problem reached their own territories . 
  even germany was a lot more critical before a significant number of the migrants reached them . 
  clearly it 's not worth nothing , because it stopped illegal immigrants for a few days , until they found the route to croatia and the croatian government bussed them to their border with hungary . 
  yes , it 's a criminal offence to damage or trespass the fence . 
  none of them have been imprisoned yet , they were all expelled and banned from entering the eu for 1-2 years and they now have an eu criminal record , with their fingerprints and photos taken . 
  do you think hungary should just shit on schengen and just sit down and watch as hundreds of thousands of people are breaking its and the eu 's laws and endanger national security ? 
  should we just say `` ok , whatever , come if you want it so much boys '' no . 
  there are laws and europe is one of the few places on earth where laws mean something . 
  we have passports and visas for a reason . 
  are we really spitting in the face of all those who abide by laws and are we setting a precedent where those who overtly , publicly break laws get the best treatment in the end ? 
  i hope not !, 
  the csu in bavaria is pretty angry at her . 
  you say hungary let them in , so it has to deal with them . 
  but when we do n't let them in illegally through the outside schengen border , then it 's the `` wrong way '' to deal with this . 
  you know , tell your own country what to do . 
  yes , i think he wants countries to propose absolute numbers voluntarily , perhaps specifying it per source country too . 
  and then assessing the cases individually . 
  no permanent distribution system based on percentages or any systematic rules . 
  border protection is not optional . 
  it 's the law . 
  when laws are violated on a massive scale like this , it has all sorts of consequences socially . 
  he 's using the term `` contingent '' as opposed to `` quota '' . 
  he said he 'll clarify what he means with the difference . 
  orb\u00e1n said he would offer to take refugees on a voluntary basis . 
  think a few thousands , not tens of thousands . 
  but the quota is seen by him as a pseudo-action . 
  it wastes time , when thousands are flooding in uncontrollably every single day . 
  then `` go to germany '' . 
  they will hop on a train and go there . 
  but the quota system wants to relocate ( tens of ) thousands upon thousands . 
  they will all go back to germany , basically . 
  will germany lock them in hundreds of trains ? 
  will thousands upon thousands sit there in handcuffs ? 
  all the more surprising that this reuters article is quoting him so extensively as if he were some very important , highly regarded european politician ... 
  because it 's a bad legal situation . 
  we 'd have to violate the schengen treaty and risk being thrown out . 
  you know , germany ca n't unilaterally ensure unofficially that `` it will be all right '' . 
  schengen is a treaty among lots of countries that gave hungary a duty . 
  if letting ** anybody at all ** without * any * identification or * any * papers into the schengen zone is not a violation of the treaty then ** what ** is ?!, 
  really . 
  how can a politician be so irresponsible ? 
  again , they could hand out visas but they do n't . 
  this way they can criticize * any * action of these eastern states . 
  any actions . 
  nothing is good for germany now . 
  okay i was wrong it 's 157,746 until the 8th of september . 
  google the number to find sources . 
  thanks , but not the romanian government . 
  see the ponta quotes in the op article . 
   90 % were unwilling to register actually over 170,000 have registered ( and left asap ) . 
  do you remember the scenes in the budapest-keleti train station ? 
  they were `` stranded '' there for days because hungary did n't let them board trains . 
  the main station was even closed off totally for some time . 
  then international trains were cancelled . 
  they camped there in front of the station for days . 
  why ? 
  because hungary did n't let them to austria or germany . 
  and at that time that was considered cruel by the media . 
  then merkel said , okay , they can come . 
  and from that day ( september 4 ) the masses are flowing . 
   other sources mentioned candidate countries too as safe by default that 's right . 
  see here at 7:38 https://youtu.be/ofg0_1lhl_e?t=7m38s it 's necessary so that serbia can be considered safe . 
   other sources mentioned it should repeated as many times as necessary also confirmed by the above video . 
  germany wo n't let tens or hundreds of thousands of people live on the streets . 
  maybe they will make camps like in calais . 
  they are determined to go to germany . 
  and then when you have so many homeless people there , with children , how will you refuse to feed them ? 
  ah , can you really do that on a regular scale of hundreds of thousands of people ? 
   some kind of measures anything short of imprisonment will have no effect . 
  how do you keep them from getting on a train ? 
  they do n't care if they do n't get benefits . 
  they do n't think like that . 
  they think `` let 's be in germany , and we 'll see what happens , if we are in germany , things will work out somehow '' . 
  the fence is a `` treatment '' in his terminology not a `` solution '' . 
  it 's an immediate treatment of a symptom . 
  even those were isolated cases , as far as i know . 
  hungary is building a fence that will be activated any hour now and gets shit for it . 
  what do people actually want then ? 
  we made sure to protect the serbian border . 
  now the route deviated towards croatia and then back to hungary . 
  we are working on closing that border too . 
  and for that hungary is compared to fascism . 
  because we are trying to channel people to designated entry points . 
  that 's the difference . 
  also , would it be better if we registered them somewhere else ? 
  do you want to see them again in live breaking news at the main train station and marching on motorways ? 
  just think for a second , please , just a second . 
  germany is now starting to feel the existence of upper limits ...
