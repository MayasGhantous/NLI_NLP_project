  another is about the dream of emese . 
  the legend says that a pregnant hungarian woman called emese saw a dream , in which a mythical bird called the turul impregnated her and she realized that a lineage of great kings would come from her womb . 
  she named her son \u00c1lmos , which means `` dream-y '' ( it also means `` sleepy '' ) . 
  and indeed the son of \u00c1lmos , called \u00c1rp\u00e1d , led the hungarians into the carpathian basin in 895 and established the house of \u00c1rp\u00e1d that ruled hungary until 1301 . 
  emese is a popular name for girls to this day . 
  in terms of tv viewer counts the list goes : * car racing * football * boxing, 
  i do n't think this is a `` model '' at all . 
  it 's just to remind people that beliefs , assumptions about how society should work , what constitutes good behavior etc etc. 
  are * part of what we call culture * and people with different cultural backgrounds often have different views on this attitude level . 
  this is probably trivial and goes without saying for you , but many people never question their own basic assumptions about society ( or even see them as such , as opposed to just `` the right way for things to be '' ) , and they assume that cultural differences are mostly about food , clothes , dances etc. 
  people who are critical or weary of multiculturalism are usually * not * against different styles of music or differently spiced food , but the different values . 
   it is for instance perfectly possible to have different believes about sex , religion or politeness take part in the same cultural practices just as it is possible to have the same beliefs and engage in different practices . 
  this is precisely why we need to differentiate between the two , because they can vary independently . 
  i could also liken the situation to language , where one can differentiate between vocabulary and grammar . 
  we can easily give and take words among languages without reaching into the deeper structure of the language . 
  similarly , it 's very easy and unproblematic to absorb different foods , music and festivities into a culture . 
  the problem is when the `` deep cultures '' clash ( deep values , like what is the point of life , what should society strive to achieve , do our man-made laws stand above `` god 's laws '' , etc. 
   a fundamental concept of values that every member of society has to share to be a good member of the society and these differ from culture to culture . 
  what 's the modern take on the topic ? 
  i think the image is pretty useful when talking among laypeople . 
  most people think of special food , songs and dances when they hear `` culture '' and not the values or other unsaid , deeper things . 
  when you say this is pretty bad without pointing out specifics , corrections , alternatives , references , further reading links etc. , it seems like you just want to feel and seem more knowledgeable and superior but you 're not helpful . 
  [ there 's surface culture and then there 's deep culture . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/4egsm00.png ) having diverse * deep * cultures in a country leads to conflict and resentment . 
  i think what most pro-multiculturalism people advertise or advocate for is a * uniform * global humanist secular liberal individualist deep culture with nice diverse and colorful surface culture elements collected from all over the world . 
  but what it actually ends up like is parallel deep cultures living side by side or in the more educated and affluent circles ( good universities etc. ), 
  it results in a uniformization of the deeper elements of culture . 
  so multiculturalism in the deep sense moves always towards either separation or uniformization . 
  in hungary it has no such connotations at all . 
  it 's a very `` average joe '' name . 
  there are great differences between european countries in this regard . 
  for example hungarian people 's foreign language skills are on a similar level as americans ' : ~ 25 % speak at least one foreign language . 
  [ source us ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/1825/about-one-four-americans-can-hold-conversation-second-language.aspx ) , [ source hungary ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/foreign_language_skills_statistics ) . 
  ( we are by far the worst in the eu in this ) . 
  but the younger generations are better . 
  we start with one foreign language at around age 6 and then at the better schools we add another one sometime around 13-15 years old . 
  the most popular ones are english , german , french , spanish , italian . 
  why answer if you ca n't answer ? 
  i guess the question is from which voting district he got into the parliament ( egy\u00e9ni v\u00e1laszt\u00f3ker\u00fclet ) . 
  the answer is none , because he got in from the national party list part of our voting . 
  in hungary we have two ballots to cast our vote on . 
  one is for choosing a representative of our local district and one is for choosing a party list ( on a national level ) . 
  yeah we have some , in parks mainly . 
  and there 's a new project where they install [ fountain-like taps on fire hydrants ] ( http://img.444.hu/dbogi20150912019.jpg ) , which is pretty nice . 
  ( if there 's a fire , then the tap can be taken off very easily ), 
  we had one in primary school ( age ~ 6-14 ) . 
  it was a photocopied amateurish thing . 
  the news were about study cometitions ( like math or poetry reciting competitions at school or in the district ) , we had a jokes section , a formula 1 section ( because one guy really liked formula 1 ) , we had an english section , a video games section etc. 
  we also had some of the best school essays ( actual graded essays ) published there . 
  there were absolutely no ads in there , we have a very different mentality about mixing commercial stuff and school ( it 's a no-no ) . 
  we did n't ever have any branded anything from school ( like no buffet or any place you could spend money at school at all ) . 
  in secondary school , we had no such thing . 
  at one point some students decided to make a blog , but it 's been dead for four years now . 
  being very engaged and active about non-obligatory school stuff is not as normal or expected here as in the us . 
  \u00dar for men and \u00farh\u00f6lgy / asszony ( married ) / kisasszony ( unmarried , old-fashioned ) for women . 
  and we put it after the surname , for example `` kov\u00e1cs \u00far '' ( mr. kov\u00e1cs ) . 
  '' \u00dar '' means `` lord '' originally ( \u00dar is also used when referring to god , like the english `` lord '' ) . 
  but we do n't use this scheme as often as in english i think . 
  we rather say the title , like `` eln\u00f6k \u00far '' ( mr. chairman ) , doktor \u00far ( mr. 
  director ) . 
  and when starting a letter it 's also proper to just state the name , like `` tisztelt kov\u00e1cs j\u00e1nos ! '', 
  ( literally `` respected john smith '' ) . 
  hungary does n't have very strong cultural differences between regions . 
  the biggest divide i think is between the capital budapest ( ~ 2 million people ) and the rest ( ~ 8 million ) . 
  if we consider the whole hungarian nation , then a ( probably obvious ) big difference is between the transylvanian hungarians ( especially the sz\u00e9kelys ) and those in hungary proper . 
  the point is that people never get the name of either of their grandmothers . 
  the two surnames of each person come from the two grandfathers . 
  so a woman 's name `` dies out '' after a generation . 
   very few people are hateful or prejudiced towards gypsies who have abandoned the travelling life around here in eastern central europe they do n't travel any more ( i think they were all settled around the beginning of the communist years ) . 
  they are settled but usually live in the outskirts of cities and villages . 
  sometimes they get some state funds to move to apartements in the city center but those programs usually end in disaster as they make the neighborhood unbearable for the people there ( noise , shouting , garbage , dirt , threatening behavior etc. 
  a fair european autonomy system with extensive rights to ethnic groups that are minorities in the country as a whole . 
  it serves as a good example when discussing a potential autonomous region for the sz\u00e9kely hungarians in romania . 
  for christians , christmas is about the birth of jesus christ , the savior of mankind . 
  the weeks before it are called the advent , and it 's about waiting for the messiah . 
  giving gifts is based on the story that kings and shepherds gave gifts to the little jesus . 
   it has nothing to do with religion if you do n't go to church . 
  you can also sing or listen to [ religious ( ly inspired ) songs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fuw78nbs60 ) outside of church . 
  which i often do as an atheist because i like the atmosphere and the tradition . 
   if you want to be an atheist you have to not celebrate any obviously religious holidays that 's a weird way to see it . 
  i 'm an atheist because i do n't believe that any gods exist . 
  i do n't `` want to be an atheist '' , i just do n't believe that there are any gods . 
   what do you think about this term ? 
  it 's useful in a multicultural society where there are ( cultural ) christians , jews , muslims , hindus , buddhists etc. 
  live together . 
   is it a term that is also used in your country ? 
  i 've only heard this term in english ( `` cultural christian '' ) , we do n't really use such a phrase in hungary , because most people ( except the jews ) are ( cultural ) christians , so we usually just talk about whether someone is religious or not ( and `` cultural christians '' count as ` not ' ) . 
   christmas is n't about jesus for quite a lot of christians . 
  what ? 
  what are they preparing for during the advent weeks then ? 
   french salad we also call it like that ( [ franciasal\u00e1ta ] ( http://static.femina.hu/karacsony/franciasalata/franciasalata.jpg ) ) . 
  [ bread with fat , salt , paprika and red onions ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qnpms6fyelg/u3opdtwgbxi/aaaaaaaahim/ahg9az0rgnm/s1600/dscf7031.jpg ) is also very well known in hungary as a poor man 's food and is somewhat popular ( mainly in rural places and with older people ) . 
  you can also usually find it in cheap bars ( often as the only food available ) . 
  students stand up when the teacher comes in , then a student * goes to the front and reports to the teacher how many students there are in the class and who are absent . 
  `` to mister/miss teacher i report with respect , the class has 32 students , absent are x y and w z. '', 
  then the teacher thanks him/her and everyone sits down . 
  * a student does this for one week then comes the next one in alphabetical order . 
  their other tasks include cleaning the blackboard and similar stuff . 
  obviously has a good amount of fans , just like anywhere . 
  he gave 3 concerts in budapest and each time he stayed at hotel kempinski , where the fans made [ a memorial tree ] ( http://welovebudapest.com/image/img.5317.2.exact726w.jpg?v=3 ) where they gather two times a year ( his birthday and his day of death ) .
