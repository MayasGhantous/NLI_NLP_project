  also i think his songs are quite popular in the general population , especially the earlier , less `` whiny '' ones as far as i can tell ( think `` beat it '' and `` smooth criminal '' , not `` you are not alone '' or `` earth song '' ) . 
  and hungarian musicians often say he was an inspiration for them . 
  when i was a schoolkid ( late 90s ) we often joked about the legend that allegedly his nose fell off at a concert . 
  and his turning `` from black to white '' was also the source of jokes . 
  i remember i was reluctant to admit i like mj songs when i was a teen as it was n't `` cool '' . 
  now that he 's dead , it 's cool to respect him ( at least for his music ) . 
  because also many people are convinced that he was a filthy pedophile . 
  i guess we are n't much different than other places , he 's controversial , he 's respected , he 's liked and disliked . 
  usually 60-70 % for parliamentary elections . 
  `` hollandia '' is the only term for the netherlands in hungarian , so it 's not sloppy usage here , it 's the only one . 
  in informal speech we usually say `` england '' or `` the english '' for the whole of the uk in general , but of course not if specifically another part of the uk is meant . 
  `` jenki '' for `` yankee '' exists , but it 's quite rare . 
  another short term is `` amcsi '' ( am-chee ) for `` american '' . 
  in terms of mentality , cuisine , customs , history and such things . 
  with some better political management perhaps we could have jumped out of the axis like romania did . 
  but definitely not too easily , since we got occupied by the germans anyway . 
  i do n't really have enough history knowledge to assess the issue better , but anyway it was another item on out list of historic moments of getting fucked . 
  not to mention the destruction of budapest for example . 
  or going back to the 1921 borders . 
  yeah , it 's good that germany did n't get to rule everything , but what came instead was not good either . 
  all of the 20th century basically . 
  trianon , holocaust , defeat in wwii , soviet occupation , the crushing of 1956 , the communist years ... 
  there 's * a lot * to generate heated discussions here . 
  most people have never even seen an automatic transmission , it 's not a topic usually . 
  it 's like `` how are steering wheels viewed in the country '' . 
  the gear shift is just part of a car . 
  it was remote from the population . 
  so it 's more seen like a `` chess move '' , simply soldiers attacking a military base . 
  like the siege of a fortress in the middle ages . 
  it 's simply not emotionally striking around here . 
  meanwhile in europe there were things like stalingrad and many other cities destroyed . 
  like our capital budapest was also ruined , all bridges destroyed , royal palace destroyed , 6 % of our population died , in poland it was 17 % . 
  when such things are happening , an event like ph does n't seem so interesting or iconic to us . 
  yes , most people know about it , but it 's not a `` shocking '' event . 
  i do n't think they are `` weirdly sensitive '' . 
  in many places it 's expected that the guy is taller than the girl in relationships . 
  and girls tend to look for someone taller than them . 
  perhaps less so in case of `` modern-thinking '' , educated city girls ( i do n't know about any studies , i 'm just guessing ) , but it 's generally so . 
  and therefore short guys have a smaller pool of girls available to them . 
  they are also probably taken less seriously by big and strong agressive guys , many get bullied etc. 
  rereading that sentence , i do n't see anything like that implied there . 
  it 's just that there were much more important events here in europe where tens of millions of civilians and soldiers died in a span of like 5 years . 
  when something like that is going on , city centers bombed to the ground , millions taken to concentration camps , unreliable access to food etc. 
  then an attack on a remote military base does n't seem too important . 
  of course it is for americans because the us has n't had a major conflict happening on the mainland since the civil war ( and even that was much less tragic than wwii for most european countries ) . 
  so being attacked on a remote military base is a bigger deal there . 
  also , we do n't see europe as a block that does things to `` itself '' . 
  it 's just a geographical location where some nations were at war with other nations . 
   not many people have nicknames in norway it 's so strange . 
  these are n't personalized , special nicknames , so it 's easy to have them . 
  at ages up to ~ 11 it 's given name/nickname + `` n\u00e9ni '' ( for female teachers ) or `` b\u00e1csi '' ( for male teachers ) . 
  `` n\u00e9ni '' and `` b\u00e1csi '' are simply respectful `` titles '' for an older adult , they do n't have english equivalents and are usually translated as `` aunt '' and `` uncle '' but they are n't about family relations here ( `` nagyn\u00e9ni '' and `` nagyb\u00e1csi '' would indeed mean aunt and uncle in the family sense ) . 
  take a male teacher named `` nagy ferenc '' . 
  hungarian name order is family name + given name , so his given name is ferenc , and the common nickname version of ferenc is feri . 
  so kids would call him `` feri b\u00e1csi '' . 
  a female teacher with the name `` kiss j\u00falia '' would be called `` juli n\u00e9ni '' . 
  from approx . 
  age ~ 11 or ~ 15 ( depending on local customs ) it 's simply tan\u00e1r \u00dar ( mr. 
  teacher ) or tan\u00e1rn\u0151 ( ms. 
  teacher ) , without the actual name . 
  this goes on up to and beyond university . 
  if there are multiple teachers around , you could put the surname before it , like `` nagy tan\u00e1r \u00dar '' or `` kiss tan\u00e1rn\u0151 '' ( mr. 
  teacher nagy , ms. 
  teacher kiss ) . 
  `` tan\u00e1r \u00dar '' / `` tan\u00e1rn\u0151 '' are respectful even for university professors , but one can also say `` professzor \u00dar '' / `` professzor asszony '' to them . 
   it would seem very odd and formal to call one of your professors professor smith instead of just dave . 
  around here the professor - student relationship is indeed formal , so it does n't feel odd . 
  of course it 's different for the exercise class `` teachers '' who are often students themselves just a few years above you . 
  an american military base got attacked so they entered the war . 
  meanwhile here in europe , millions were being killed in the war , so we do n't spend much time on ph in history classes . 
  it 's probably more known through the movie . 
  usually nothing fancy for non-rich people . 
  something [ like this ] ( http://img.jofogas.hu/hdimages/kertvarosi_csaladi_haz_85009600376778.jpg ) . 
  especially in rural places people grow some tomatoes , cucumbers , grapes etc. 
  and have fruit trees . 
  apple and cherry trees are quite popular , also walnut trees for nice shades in the hot summer . 
  and there 's often some stuff from earlier lying around that `` may be useful sometime '' , like bricks , wooden boards or fence parts etc. 
  a barrel for collecting rainwater for watering , or a well are also not too rare . 
  in villages some people have chickens but it 's making less and less economic sense . 
  earlier , people used to have pigs and cows as well , but they are now too expensive for most , i think . 
  the old socialist mentality is still with us at many places . 
  basically they think `` ah damn , another customer is here , why do they have to bother me all the time '' . 
  this is especially true for older or lower paid workers . 
  in the old era customers had to keep quiet , follow the rules of the place , and do whatever the people having local power ( those working there ) told them ; and then be very thankful if they actually did what their job was . 
  since job security was big , and there was a state monopoly in basically everything , there was no culture of `` customer satisfaction '' or anything like that . 
  it just was n't even a considered aspect , it was irrelevant . 
  and today , people in customer service are paid really low here , and it plagues the mentality . 
  they often do n't feel `` loyal '' to the company , they do n't care if someone never comes back and the company ( who pays so little salary ) gets less profit . 
  more expensive hotels and restaurants are of course on par with western european professionalism , but elsewhere it 's easy to feel that you as a customer are not really wanted . 
  for example in my experience hungarian workers at kebab or chinese takeaways will consistently give you less food in your box than immigrants ( turks , chinese etc. ) . 
  there 's just a general feel of hostility instead of hospitality . 
  when i was in germany , i was very pleasantly suprised how kind and happy the supermarket cashiers are . 
  in hungary they are very low paid and have very stressful working conditions and it 's visible that they are grumpy/depressed/lifeless etc. 
  another surprise was that a kind person greeted me in not-too-expensive clothing shops as well , asking what i was looking for and looking genuinely helpful . 
  in hungary even if they ask how they can help , it 's often visible that they want you to go to hell . 
  some tourists in hungary think that this hostility is directed to them being foreigners , but it 's simply the general way here and it 's one of those things that negatively impacts daily life . 
  however i have to say that it 's getting better in recent years , with more and more tourists arriving in budapest who can afford to pay more , so there can be better paid service jobs , with better mentality . 
  it also helps that young people nowadays travel more and can compare and bring home some of the professional helpfulness that 's standard in western europe . 
  not many . 
  the viewership and callers usually self-select to align with the channel 's political side .
