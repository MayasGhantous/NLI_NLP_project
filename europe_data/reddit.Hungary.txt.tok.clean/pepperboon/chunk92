  perhaps there is some filter or pre-talk with the caller to see what they want to say , but i 'm not sure about that , i can imagine that there 's no such thing . 
  there are also some regulars who call very often and say almost the same boring stuff each time . 
  and some read out loud some long text that they wrote in advance in a monotonous tone , that 's very boring too . 
  ah and by the way in the title you said `` usually politics '' , we used to have [ a non-political phone-in show ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmg_jnzagoi ) late at night with a woman in not much clothing and you could discuss any sort of topics , like relationships , sex or whatever . 
  there were lots of prank calls , like those in this video . 
  it 's one of the trashiest shows in hungarian tv history and this whole channel ( `` budapest tv '' ) was very trashy . 
  i can think of multiple : - scientology sees psychology and psychiatric treatment as bogus , harmful and a serious enemy . 
  they want to replace it with their practices . 
  they prey on people who are mentally unstable , have a ruined emotional life etc. 
  so they are in direct competition with psychiatry . 
  by doing things that otherwise usually done by psychologists ( talking about drug stuff and `` how to say no '' or how to get off it etc. ), 
  they present themselves as another legitimate entity that acts in the same sphere as psychology/psychiatry - getting into the drug prevention scene may give them access to unstable people who are drug addicts or know drug addicts etc. 
  - they get more embedded in the `` fabric of society '' in general by mingling , such that members can drop a few words here and there about how scientology helped them - they associate good things with scientology in real life . 
  people ( * especially uninformed school directors , teachers , politicans * ) then say , ah the media is often distorted for sensationalism , but in my real world experience these are just normal people who want the same as `` good parents '' : health , sports , mental/soul development and no drugs, 
  yes , although there have been a few cases in the press that they organize `` drug prevention events '' even in/with schools through their daughter organizations without making it clear that it 's scientology . 
  they say it has nothing to do with the `` religion '' , they just want to do some good ... 
  so few foreigners ever try to speak hungarian that we do n't even know what the accents would sound like . 
  there 's no `` common knowledge '' about this here . 
  yes , we have [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs7vzidty8q ) every day . 
  mostly old pensioners rambling incoherently about how little pension they get , how stuff is expensive , how they hate the other political side , how bad the health care system and their health is , etc. 
  but there are usually some recommended topics every day from the recent news . 
  this is the left-wing one . 
  there used to be [ a right-wing call-in show ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe4fqr6ncsq ) as well ( both videos are just examples after a quick googling ) . 
  the demographic was fairly similar , perhaps a bit more middle-aged people compared to the other program . 
  in hungary : * there 's a '' [ personal id ] ( http://online-kalkulator.hu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/%c3%9aj-ek%c3%a1rtya-%c3%adgy-n%c3%a9z-ki.jpg ) '' for everyone above 14 . 
  * there 's [ a separate card ] ( http://erdely.ma/ujkepek/2012/04/nagy/1020951.jpg ) that everyone has , in order to prove the address where you live ( or if you 're homeless , it says so , like in this particular picture ) . 
  * those who drive need to have an eu standard compliant [ driving licence ] ( http://rewrite.origos.hu/s/img/i/1302/20130207-valtozik-a-jogositvany-vezetoi-engedely.jpg ) * those who want to travel to a country outside both the eu and the schengen zone , need to have a [ passport ] ( http://www.maszol.ro/uploads/files/userfiles/images/szines/2015/%c3%81prilis/21/utlevel.jpg ) . 
  there are eu directives that standardize these things . 
  for example the personal id is accepted as a travel document within the eu . 
  the personal id and the address id are free . 
  driving license and passport cost money . 
  you do n't need to have a personal id if you have a driving license or a passport . 
   i do n't know about eu law , but danish law does n't . 
  but we protect other nations and states flags . 
  looks like hungary is the exact reverse . 
  our law protects our own flag but not others . 
  it is forbidden to desecrate certain hungarian national symbols before the general public , by offensive or degrading language or in other ways . 
  these symbols are : the anthem , flag , coat-of-arms and the holy crown of hungary . 
  the maximum sentence is one year in prison . 
  the constitutionality of ( an earlier version of ) this law was confirmed by the constitutional court in 2000 . 
  however , i do n't think anyone was ever convicted of this crime ( at least in the last 26 years ) . 
  however , the flags of other countries are not protected in a similar way . 
  also our homeless look poorer than the woman in the video who says she 's homeless . 
  and they do n't shout , are n't obnoxious , they just look poor and melancholic/depressed and often smell quite bad from far away . 
  [ here 's a pic ] ( http://m.cdn.blog.hu/ju/judynero/image/n%c5%91.jpg ) and [ another one ] ( http://static.femina.hu/terasz/hajlektalan_nok/szallo_no.jpg ) for the general idea of a homeless woman here . 
  even when they beg , they usually come close , keep their gaze low and just mumble something quietly , asking for spare change ( instead of shouting like in the video ) . 
  sometimes there are homeless-looking people on public transport who shout but generally nothing comprehensible and they are probably mentally unstable ( unlike the woman in the video who even if in a particular speaking style , still talks in understandable complete sentences ) . 
  definitely not like this . 
  definitely no well-dressed , middle-class-looking people like in the video , and never talking so eloquently . 
  it 's also forbidden to beg on the subway . 
  but if it happens , it 's usually just either a silent homeless person in rags or gypsies . 
  but they rather do it in bus stops or tram stops , it 's quite rare to see them on the subway . 
  i do n't travel very frequently with the subway , but i have not seen begging there since many many years . 
  yes , with some limitations . 
  included are : * emergency treatment * yearly checkups * fillings ( with some limitations ) * surgeries * tartar removal * treatment of gum diseases * etc. 
  braces and dentures for people under 18 are partially covered ( the medical treatment is fully covered , the brace/denture itself partially ) . 
  above 18 , braces and dentures themselves are still partially covered but you have to pay full for the treatment . 
  also some more rules depending on whether you go to school/college , are above 62 or pregnant etc. 
  ----- however !, 
  anyone who can ( even with some difficulty ) afford private dental care usually chooses private . 
  it 's just more reliable , more pleasant , much less waiting time etc. 
  for example when i needed braces in my teenage years , we first tried the public system , but we were always told to wait more and more and more , we spent more than 6 months waiting . 
  we went back multiple times when they told us , each time we had to wait a lot in the hospital as well , only to be told `` nope , not yet , come back around [ some date ] '' . 
  and during the whole time they were quite rude and unhelpful . 
  almost all dentists who work in public dentistries/hospitals have their own private place as well , in parallel . 
  and they try to pressure people into going to their private dentristry . 
  ( understandably , because their salary is * abysmal * , something like 500 $ / month i think , while in private praxis they can make much much more , almost comparably to a low-earning western european private dentist ) so in the end we went to a private dentist for the braces , but we still got some coverage on it . 
  and in general too , me and my family usually go private for checkups , cleanings , fillings and tooth replacements as it 's often better quality and you are n't treated like shit , unlike the public dentistries . 
  to be considered hungarian by the hardline nationalists in such cases , be white , do n't be jewish or muslim , speak hungarian natively , know hungarian history and culture and identify with hungary 's side and interests . 
  1 ) if they speak hungarian natively and know and identify with the culture and history , then yes . 
  otherwise they will be `` of hungarian origins '' , not `` hungarian '' . 
  3-4-5 ) if they speak hungarian natively and identify with hungarian culture and history , then yes they will be considered as assimilated to be hungarian . 
  however , if they look very visibly different , like east asian or black , then it 's tougher to be accepted by the nationalists . 
  6 ) we do n't have them . 
  i think neutrally/slightly positively for most people . 
  a great military leader and conqueror , like a newer version of an alexander the great figure or similar . 
  and on the negative side he 's generally seen as somewhat overly egoistic as he insisted in crowning himself emperor ( not only the title , but that he crowned * himself * ) . 
  other than this , we do n't really care or talk much about him , since he only waged war with hungary for a short time . 
  ah yeah and that he was so short and held his hand in that particular way in his shirt . 
  and had that funny hat . 
  that 's all . 
  many countries think about this differently . 
  for example in hungary we say this is our 3rd republic , but it does n't mean we are n't the same state . 
  actually , today 's hungary is the same state as the medieval kingdom , there is legal continuity , it 's simply that the form of state and the territory have changed . 
  and every time the form of state changed to republic , we incremented the number , so hungary was * principality 895-1000 * kingdom 1000-1918 * ( first ) republic 1918-20 * kingdom again 1920-1946 * ( second ) republic 1946-1949 * people 's republic 1949-1989 ( considered an illegitimate foreign imposition ) * ( third ) republic 1989 - so you can still be the same state and mark the different eras with different numbers . 
  as for home repairs and renovations , it 's difficult to find good ones . 
  it 's mostly by word of mouth and recommendation . 
  unfortunately most of the good ones have left for austria , germany , uk etc. 
  to earn several times more money . 
  and if you want it done really well , it costs a lot . 
  or you do it yourself . 
  in my family we usually do everything we can . 
  we 've laid wall and floor tiles and laminate floor , replaced electric wires , sockets , water taps , built our own furniture , we painted walls , put on wallpapers , built our own custom furniture , all sorts of stuff . 
  in my experience you mostly get lousy work from the average `` handyman '' , they pay much less attention than we do since it 's our own thing . 
  of course you can find better ones , but they are very expensive . 
  most `` average '' people here do n't have the time and money to do that and also go for a vacation somewhere else . 
  people 's first goal is to have a family vacation once a year , and that 's already quite difficult for many people . 
  also , most people here have 20-30 days free from work in a year so staying there two months would not be possible . 
  not very usual . 
  you need to be rather well-off financially to afford one in a good neighborhood ( mostly around lake balaton ) .
