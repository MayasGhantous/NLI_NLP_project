  and not too many people want to go to some run-down village far from everything where property is dirt cheap . 
  i think it 's better to stay at a cheap apartment or rent a house for a few days , instead of all that hassle and costs with maintaining your own house there . 
  not to mention that if you rent a place every summer , then you do n't have to be at the same place every year . 
  i do n't really see the appeal . 
  we have many new houses as well ( like even houses that were built this year ) . 
  i think this stereotype of the centuries old european houses only really fits the town centers and especially in the benelux countries and their neighbors . 
  for example in the core of budapest almost everything is from the late 19th century , so not even 150 years old . 
  only few buildings are medieval ( they are mostly in the castle district ) . 
  but historic churches and castles are old , of course , mostly medieval . 
  i live in the suburbs and these entire neighborhoods were just created like 50 years ago . 
  mine is approx . 
  40 years old , give or take . 
   some of these neologisms are really basic though . 
  how did n't hungarian have a word for beak ? 
  what did they call it before that ? 
  the beak was simply called the nose of the bird , `` orr '' . 
  and `` cs\u0151r '' is an artificial creation from `` cs\u0151 '' ( tube ) + `` orr '' ( nose ) . 
  coined by j\u00f3zsef bachich in 1821 . 
  many people see the muslim world as a monolithic block with not much distinction between arabs , turks , iranians , afghans . 
  more educated people would know they are different , but we have no first-hand experience about the `` practical '' differences here in hungary . 
  i think there should be an eu army , because right now we 're totally relying to the us in military issues . 
   leaders of the free world neatly splitting the world into free and not free countries is a remnant of cold war propaganda , when the us called itself and its allies `` the free world '' . 
  it 's a silly concept . 
  if there is some guilt , it could be `` french guilt '' for that which has been done by the french . 
  and `` british guilt '' for their crimes . 
  and `` german guilt '' for the holocaust . 
  it makes no sense to talk about `` white guilt '' , because european ethnicities do n't identify with each other 's histories just because our skin color is similar . 
  that 's more a us thing . 
  i as a hungarian have absolutely no connection to how the spanish killed the native americans or how the british treated people in india . 
  i look at it from the outside , just like a japanese person would . 
  i 'd say it 's mainly a thing in germany . 
  they say it is n't so , but compared with britain ( who are often even proud of their empire ) germans want to put all patriotic/nationalistic things in the past ( like flags even ) . 
  they 'll say it 's about learning from history and changing their attitude to a more enlightened one , but from the outside it looks like guilt to me . 
  i 'm not federalist , but there 's a need for a better distribution of power among different levels . 
  there needs to be more power for regional ( sub-national ) territories for the really local issues , then comes the national level , the eu/continental level and of course we need global coordination for global issues . 
  but calling this a worldwide federation of single global country is foolish . 
  i do n't want so much centralized power . 
  only the really global things ( e.g. 
  climate , environment , nuclear weapons , space , perhaps ai in the future ) should be regulated on a global scale . 
  but if you want a worldwide federation , the best way to achieve it would be an external enemy . 
  nothing unites people better than a common enemy . 
  aliens are the only way . 
  mutual intelligibility is very high . 
  the differences are mostly pronunciation . 
  for example many or even most dialects have two sounds for what is just `` e '' in the standard variety , an open and a closed version . 
  and these two sounds are shifted in different dialects . 
  there are dialects with diphthongs ( the standard does n't have them ) or some lengthen vowels where the standard has an `` l '' ( like standard `` volt '' , dialectal `` v\u00f3t '' ) . 
  the most different dialect from the standard , budapest variety ( that 's most used in the media ) is the cs\u00e1ng\u00f3 dialect spoken in romania ( with some different words too ) . 
  to illustrate the difference , here 's a movie dubbed both [ in standard hungarian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyyuphshub4&amp;t=1m8s ) and in [ cs\u00e1ng\u00f3 hungarian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyhcxjvgicm&amp;t=8m18s ) . 
  do tell me how it sounds to you and if you can hear the difference . 
  ( the standard one is more professionally produced though ), 
  yes , the only thing about skin color here is people wondering if you 're maybe gypsy . 
  but being a typical gypsy also has other stereotypical signs ( clothes , way of walking , stance , talking style ) . 
  so you also have to fit some of these to really look gypsy , skin tone is not all . 
  and also note that we 're not talking about any sort of rule here ( like op 's question about one-drop ) . 
  we 're only talking about how someone looks , not who their parents are . 
  there 's no hard rule for mixed-ethnicity people . 
  if a half gypsy person looks more like their gypsy parent , then he 'll be more considered a gypsy , if he 's more like the non-gypsy parent , then he wo n't . 
  except if the brown skin makes you look gypsy . 
  in hungary this question does n't really arise , there are so few blacks here ( mostly tourists and exchange students ) . 
  we do n't really have much experience with how a half or quarter black person looks like , so saying `` did you see that black guy wearing flipflops in front of me at the cashiers ? '', 
  can refer to someone who 's `` black enough '' to look foreign and blacker than , say , indians . 
  but since there are so few blacks , it 's rather a curiosity , we do n't really have negative stereotypes attached to it ( although it does get to us through us media , but we do n't really `` feel '' it ) . 
  we do n't have `` race '' or `` ethnicity '' written in any official documentation or ids . 
  and honestly , discussing `` rules '' like this reminds me of [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/nuremberg_laws.jpg ) . 
  discussing blood and genetics like this is super racist over here . 
  xenophobia is real , but for example in case of arabs or muslims recently , it 's not really because they `` are n't white '' . 
  i think most people would consider arabs white . 
  same with `` latinos '' . 
  but whiteness is just not really the topic . 
  if an italian or greek person has rather brown skin , he does n't suddenly get into a different category . 
  he 'd just be a european foreigner , as much a stranger as a norwegian or scottish person . 
  the question whether such a person is white does n't even arise . 
  and if you 're half hungarian and half east asian/arab/gypsy it 's often not even visibly out of the usual hungarian variability . 
  long distance buses are n't touristy , they are used by locals , like students or others to visit relatives , they are an alternative to trains . 
  in hungary , our main long distance bus company is state-owned ( called vol\u00e1nbusz ) , but there are also private ones . 
  perhaps there are such companies in other countries as well . 
  it does n't really matter in terms of authenticity , none of these are specifically touristy buses , unless they advertise them as such , like with a guide who explains stuff . 
  but companies like flixbus are simply about taking you from a to b and most who need that are locals . 
  [ ours ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhg0s75prd0 ) is a hymn type , and a very sad one at that ( the tempo was slowed down to mourn the dismembering of the country at trianon ) . 
  it does n't really fit sports events , like football or the olympics . 
  there we use [ the original tempo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amg19zu-if4 ) ( without the slowdown ) . 
  i think the march type is better and leads to more cheerfulness and enthusiasm and less nation-wide depression and turning inwards . 
  ah , so we 're still talking about greece . 
  then it seems insane to pay that kind of money . 
  i 'd never expect my descendants to waste so much money on a place for my remains and my ancestors would probably also feel offended by the idea of burning so much money instead of spending it on the new generations . 
  that 's a lot , even with dutch salaries . 
  perhaps you mean 250 $ ? 
  2500 $ is like a month 's salary there , is n't it ? 
  if it were as expensive here ( adjusted by the salary differences ) then cemeteries would go empty . 
  but i guess it 's supply and demand , but i have no idea why anyone would pay a month 's salary for 3 years of grave rent . 
  it 's about 70 $ per month !, 
  in the village of my grandparents it costs about 80 $ for 25 years ( in budapest it 's more , like 250 $ for 25 years ) . 
  still some people do n't renew it as they ca n't afford it ( in the sense that this 80 or 250 $ have much more important uses in the family , some pensioners live off 200-300 $ a month ) . 
  there was a [ hungarian article ] ( http://index.hu/gazdasag/2016/11/01/temetkezesi_piac/ ) on this topic two weeks ago . 
  the main points : * 60 % cremated over the whole country and 70-90 % cremated in budapest * main reason for cremation over traditional burial is that it 's much cheaper . 
  * there used to be some popular myths about cremation , like that the body `` sits up '' during the process as the burning skin shrinks and stuff , and it seemed too morbid for many people . 
  now that such myths are dispelled , people are more willing to chose cremation . 
  * it 's becoming somewhat popular to take the ashes home , instead of leaving them at a cemetery . 
  * it 's also becoming `` fashionable '' to ceremonially throw the ashes out somewhere , like in a forest .
