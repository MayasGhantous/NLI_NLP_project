  many municipal governments already made legislation to ban this in their parks . 
  * also an increasing number of people throw the ashes out from a plane or helicopter . 
  while this sounds expensive , it 's cheaper than a traditional funeral . 
  like ~ 400 $ to cremate the body and throw the ashes into the danube ( including all the organization ) . 
  * less and less people renew the `` rent '' of the graves of their ancestors or relatives . 
  it has to be paid every 25 years and costs something like 80 $ ( rural , lot of space available ) up to and beyond 300 $ ( budapest , less space available ) per 25 year period . 
  this is too much for many people and they rather have the remains exhumated and cremated or in case of more distant relatives they just do n't renew it and leave the cemetery to do what they want . 
  --  what are graveyards like ? 
  [ this image ] ( http://24.p3k.hu/app/uploads/2013/05/temeto-gyor1.jpg ) or [ this one ] ( http://20.kerulet.ittlakunk.hu/files/ittlakunk/styles/large/public/upload/article/7/temeto1_0.jpg ) shows what a typical cemetery looks like in hungary . 
  some graves are in a bad , old condition , again due to a lack of money . 
  i was once in a cemetery in germany and it was so well-kept , with lots of flowers , nice grass , like a beautiful park . 
  i suppose they pay people ( like gardeners and cleaners ) to keep everything nice and tidy . 
   are any foods or drinks specifically associated with funerals ? 
  not specifically . 
  it 's usual to eat something together afterwards . 
  some people go to a restaurant if they do n't have enough place for the guests . 
  usually a funeral brings together rather distant relatives who only see each other at funerals and weddings . 
  so it 's polite to talk a bit afterwards and not just leave after the ceremony and the trip can also take some hours , so food makes sense . 
  but it can be anything , really . 
  like goulash . 
  or sausages or filled cabbage or whatever . 
   how often do you visit graves of relatives ? 
  all saints day ( nov 1 ) here is an official holiday and most people visit the graves on that day every year ( or some days before ) . 
  we bring some flowers ( [ white chrysanthemum ] ( http://cdn1.boon.hu/2012/10/viragpiac-01-aj-650x435.jpg ) traditionally ) and light a small lampion . 
  some people say that an even number of flowers should be used for graves ( 1 is okay too ) and an odd number for all other purposes ( like as a gift to a woman ) . 
  some people also visit the grave on the birthday of the person , or just when they are visiting the relatives living nearby . 
   if in the past your country was a communist country , then it makes a certain amount of sense for communists to be thought of as `` conservatives '' and hence `` right-wing '' . 
  but that 's not the case . 
  communism is obviously a left ideology . 
  the left here ( including the party that used to be the socialist state party in the single-party system ) mostly kept rather the internationalist aspect ( leading to the pro-globalist , pro-cosmopolitan leaning ) of socialism/communism and the need for a strong foreign power to look up to ( which instead of moscow is now western europe and the us ) . 
  the conservatives do n't like the communists , although living through those decades have obviously left its mark on everyone , including conservatives , in terms of frame of mind and everyday though-patterns ( like expecting the state to care for you , little risk-taking ) . 
  the conservatives rather look back to the times before wwii here as the `` good old times '' , but those times were also about a strong state , a monarchy , etc. 
  we never had a wild west , everyone-fend-for-themselves time around here . 
  so the ones who advocate for a small government are those who want to decrease the importance of the national government and increase the influence of globalism and the free roam of multinational companies . 
  and those happen to be our left . 
  ( at least in broad lines and rhetorics ; the reality is more subtle and of course all governments have to balance the different interests ; and they are actually all corrupt etc. ), 
  and one thing i can not understand is how in the us , christian values are associated with individualism , when actually christianity is all about loving thy neighbor and helping . 
  how is that compatible with the wild west mentality ? 
  for example universal healthcare seems like something that christians would definitely want . 
  i see . 
  i thought this right-wing = small government was a us thing . 
  here ( at least in rhetoric ) the right-wing is all about the nation , community-first , families-first , conservativism , against multinational globalist companies etc. 
  the left is very pro-western eu , liberal values , cosmopolitanism , individualism , pro-nontraditional roles and lifestyles etc. 
  evidently , right and left can mean quite different things , when different countries face very different issues and challenges . 
  since western europe 's national interest is often in the globalist multinational business ( since many are based there ) , in the eastern parts they are seen as a threat to the national interest , so the right-wing is against it ( and individualism is great for big businesses as they are good units of consumption for selling entertainment and advertisement ) . 
  since we never had colonies , our nationalists like to criticize the ruthless colonies of western powers ( or the killing of native americans across the pond ) , and even compare current business power situations to a colonization of eastern europe ; while in said western countries this is a contrarian , radical leftist opinion ( criticism of the colonial past ) and the conservatives might even feel proud to have had such great empires and are disturbed by such protests . 
  that 's why it 's pretty foolish to meddle into other countries ' politics and picking a country you support based on `` right '' or `` left '' labels without understanding their history and current situation . 
  where are you from ? 
  here , the socialists are traditionally allied with the liberals and governed in coalition between 1994-1998 and 2002-2010 . 
  by paid , i mean individually paid , i.e. 
  you need to pay when you need it . 
  in hungary it was the left-wing government who wanted to introduce privatised health care , privatise hospitals , introduce fees in education etc. 
  and the right-wing opposed it and organized a referendum against it . 
  it also nationalised some of the private pension funds . 
  here , the left is for individual liberalism and individual responsibility for one 's own life and free markets etc. , while the right is for `` imposed solidarity '' , state-supporting families , and emphasizes duties above liberties . 
  i can see two basic arguments against abortion : first , the ** moral problem with killing ** the offpring : for me this is not an issue if it 's in a short time after conception . 
  how much time ? 
  i 'm not a doctor , i do n't really know . 
  probably a few weeks . 
  second , the ** demographical implications ** ( less children born ) . 
  for this to make sense , one would also have to be against contraception and therefore against premarital sex and late marriages and this whole modern lifestyle . 
  i do worry about our new way of life that the educated and well-situated people leave starting a family to their mid-to-late 30s . 
  but it 's probably just human nature . 
  we are n't necessarily wired to want to start a family . 
  up until contraception was invented sexual desire played the role of pushing us towards starting a family ( and then the parental instincts kick in ) . 
  if regular sex does n't reliably result in pregnancy , then many people who are educated enough to know their options will not want the hassle with kids and a big lifestyle change that greatly limits their later options and costs a lot of money and would rather enjoy life a bit more . 
  but banning abortion does n't really solve such a large scale incentive problem . 
  how is it surprising that nationalism opposes federalism ? 
  nationalism is about the nations and their sovereignty . 
  the eu is then seen as a threat to this , since it reduces the importance and power of the nations ( = other , usually bigger , nations can now decide what happens in your country ) . 
   because right wing parties tend to value individualism in hungary , individualism is rather a left-liberal thing . 
  the right-wing is all about family , community , and emphasizes people 's duties towards others . 
  while the left-liberals are about individual liberties , taking responsibility for one 's own life ( like paid healthcare and education ) , etc. 
  because the english-language internet is much larger , i do n't need to rely on translators it 's faster and more direct . 
  for example in tech and science news , a lot of time the journalist who translates it does n't really understand it , and newer trends/topics take time to `` arrive '' to the hungarian part of the internet . 
  also the english wikipedia is just much much better ( not really comparable ) than the hungarian version . 
  and somehow comment sections under hungarian news are usually just direct insults , mockery and trolling and knee-jerk reactions . 
  yeah sometimes reddit is like that too , but it 's even more so on most hungarian news sites that can be commented . 
  it 's also good for practising english . 
  in modern times we basically only ever talk about `` middle class '' , `` lower-middle class '' and `` upper-middle class '' . 
  we do n't really talk about `` class '' in any other way . 
  perhaps because complaining about class has ( would have , if we did it ) a communist feel to it . 
  but also because nobility is not big here . 
  we are n't impressed by it . 
  and it 's not just a result of communism , but the way we interpret our history . 
  our revolutions against the ruling elite etc. 
  we see the historical nobility ( historical , because we never really talk about today 's nobility , because it 's just not a thing , it 's an anachronism ) as dumb , out-of-touch people who had never worked and had just inherited a heap of wealth without earning it . 
  the middle class is quite hard to define . 
  it 's basically the ordinary person who has a normal and satisfying life without struggling to pay bills and can buy `` normal '' things like not just the cheapest foods , a laptop , a car and can afford to travel for vacation , but can not really eat out in proper restaurants multiple times a week , ca n't afford taxiing around regularly , needs to pay attention to their budget and could n't go years without a salary and does n't live in a villa . 
  but money does n't correspond to high-class because for example jews were never hungarian nobles , but they are highly represented among the wealthier parts of society and for obvious reasons dislike this nobility game . 
  and money is n't everything in social stance . 
  people from traditionally wealthy , civic , intelligentsia families often speak in a derogatory way about the `` new rich '' , who became wealthy in the last one or two generations . 
  they often live differently and have different values . 
  i see . 
  in hungarian we use the same word ( f\u00e1nk ) for donuts and [ these things ] ( http://www.femina.hu/recept/fank-sutoben-sutve/farsangi-fank.jpg ) . 
  i think there 's a major difference is how we interpret diversity . 
  us diversity is a `` constant mix '' , there are people of all sorts of ethnic origins all over the country ( in europe we consider polish , german , italian , russian as different ethnicities , the word does n't imply racial differences , like black/latino etc. ) . 
  so it 's more thoroughly mixed in the whole country . 
  it 's a melting pot with many traditions mixed in . 
  in europe , we usually have cultures that have natually grown in their place over time , so they are all in their respective territories , so the differences in language/accent/culture can be quite different from place to place .
