  reddit is more about the interactivity . 
  yeah , i might find a topic from 2 years ago addressing the question i have in mind , but i ca n't interact with the people who answered there any more . 
  reddit is repetitive by design . 
  if you dislike it , then i recommend finding the relevant stack exchange site for your interest ; there are lots and i 'm a frequent user on many . 
  they are just different kinds of sites than reddit . 
  it does n't really matter . 
  i could consider them either way , but it wo n't change the fact that i do n't feel much cultural/historical connection to either . 
  if they are european , then they are n't really `` typical '' european countries . 
  the border of europe is not a significant thing . 
  the cultural/historical ties decrease with distance , but the two sides of the european border are very similar , it 's a continuous , gradual change . 
  they are the `` countries of the caucasus '' . 
  they are what they are . 
  things do n't have to fit into clearly separated neat little boxes all the time . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/budapest/comments/4y8ycu/4_days_in_budapest_what_to_do/d6mybyl ( especially [ this link ] ( http://welovebudapest.com/budapest.and.hungary/what.to.do.with.2.3.or.5.days.in.budapest ) from there ) https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17195805/whattovisitinbudapest.pdf / r/budapest / r/hungary, 
  in our parliamentary elections we have two sheets : [ one for choosing a party list ] ( http://nepszava.hu/picture/13276/normal/53/00053090.jpeg ) and [ another for choosing a representative ] ( http://www.xxii.hu/hirek/wp-content/uploads/budapesti-18-valasztokorzet-szavazolap-2014.jpg ) for one 's district . 
  and sometimes they are [ huge sheets of paper ] ( http://kozig.net/kozig/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/szavazolapok.jpg ) . 
  very often !, 
  we just sometimes have to pay attention to use native hungarian synonyms for loanwords that could be understood by speakers of other languages . 
  in that case it 's basically impossible for foreigners to understand a single word of our speech . 
  the only risk is running into other hungarians . 
  but it 's a low risk outside of popular tourist destinations or places where significant numbers of hungarians work ( german cities , england etc ), 
  that 's not really true . 
  adjectives work usually just like in english . 
  they are only written in one word if the resulting meaning is different enough such that it 's regarded as a compound word . 
  for example `` red wine '' is considered a concept on its own and not just wine that is red colored , so it 's written in one word : `` v\u00f6r\u00f6sbor '' = v\u00f6r\u00f6s ( red ) + bor ( wine ) . 
  admittedly , the line is a bit blurry , but most of the time we separate things if possible . 
  but it 's quite similar to german : `` red wine '' is `` rotwein '' and not `` roter wein '' . 
  we went by chronology , switching between world history and hungarian history every few weeks . 
  world history was mostly focused on europe , but we also learned about the other continents . 
  for many of us it seems strange that it could be taught in any other way . 
  for me recreational shooting vs. owning/carrying guns is the same as car racing vs driving like a maniac in the streets or doing mma vs. being agressive in the streets or being into bdsm vs abuse etc. 
  it 's a controlled environment . 
  i do n't know anyone who shoots regularly as a sport , so i do n't have a clear opinion on those people . 
  perhaps some shooters think of it just like a `` hit the target '' game , like darts , but i think the majority gets some kicks out of the manly aspect of controlling a murderous power . 
  to me it 's similar to a person who loves bombs and big explosions and goes in the desert to blow shit up or someone who obsesses over the chemistry of creating different poisons or stuff like that . 
  in the us this makes sense because armed burglars are n't a rare thing . 
  but here in europe a burglar wo n't risk the much more severe punishment for armed burglary since they also know that others do n't have guns . 
  it 's just a different ( and nicer ) point of equilibrium that we have in europe than in the us . 
   in rural europe you always need a car `` need '' is relative . 
  it is definitely much more convenient , but poorer people manage without one . 
  there 's usually a store in a short biking distance . 
  if you live in a small village then you need to go to the nearest mid-sized town for bigger stores , banks etc. 
  because many hungarian villages have almost nothing ( often not even a post office ) . 
  you can take a bus for that purpose ( that may come every two hours perhaps ) . 
  therefore village people without cars usually do n't do such things too often . 
  that 's one of the reasons why villages are getting depopulated and that young people move to bigger towns/cities . 
  and old village people without cars often just stay at home almost all the time and just bike around the village to visit their friends and buy food . 
  in budapest it 's quite good . 
  living in the outskirts of the city , one usually has a bus towards the center every 10-25 minutes . 
  the bus network covers the whole city and even nearby towns . 
  we have lots of tram lines , including the one on the grand boulvard ( used by 400,000 people every day ) , four metro lines , suburban railway , a good night bus network . 
  train stations are very accessible in central locations . 
  there are several long distance bus stations as well . 
  it works quite well and has improved a lot in the last decade or so ( having replaced the shittiest oldest buses and trams - only the ruined metro line 3 sticks out still like a sore thumb ) . 
  locals love to complain about it but little do they know that such an extensive network can not be taken for granted in similar sized cities around the world . 
  many trains are run-down , slow and expensive , though . 
  train stations around the country are also often quite run down . 
  normally , one third of the normal inheritance is protected such that you ca n't deny that from your kids ( compulsory share - k\u00f6telesr\u00e9sz ) . 
  however , under special conditions you are allowed to totally disown your kids , like if they : * tried to kill you or did some severe crime against you * tried to stop you from declaring your will * tried to kill another inheritor or committed a severe crime against them * live an `` immoral '' life ( ruffiant , debauched , criminal ) * were sentenced to at least 5 years in prison for something violent, 
   is the grocery store/bank/drug store and such all within a mile of so of all the houses ? 
  if many people live somewhere ( like big blocks of apartments ) then you 'll have such things right there witin 10 minutes walking . 
  similarly in the city center . 
  if you live in a village , you can bike to the local supermarket in like 5-10 minutes . 
  from the outskirts of a city you can take a bus to the center . 
  but cars are still very useful . 
  they are much faster than buses especially if you have to change lines several times to get to the other side of the city . 
  but cars , gas and maintenance are also expensive . 
  so having multiple cars per family is rather rare and a 17-20 year old getting their own car from the parents is only a thing for the rich ( i hear this is usual in the us ) . 
  commuting by bus is n't really comfortable , but it 's possible . 
  there are buses connecting the villages to nearby towns . 
  sometimes they are crowded , run down , unpunctual , perhaps going only every hour ( or in some cases even rarer ) , but if you ca n't afford a car then what can you do ? 
  you must accept it . 
  if you look below 20 , you may get carded in hungary . 
  rarer in smaller shops . 
  ( with res - reddit enhancement suite addon - there 's an option to check the source code of a comment . ), 
  we would n't change much , so it 's not my business . 
  our traditional costume parties are in february ( farsang , carnival or in german fasching ) . 
  but since movies show it and american stuff is cool for some people , there is a certain number of halloween parties in bigger cities . 
  but nobody goes to trick or treat and very few make pumkin lanterns etc. 
  i personally do n't like the commercialization , globalization and uniformization of the regional traditions . 
  i think people usually get the citizenship of the ancestors for practical reasons ( like moving to hungary or the eu or having a `` lower-value '' citizenship before ) . 
  not liking the current government is just not on the same time scale as citizenship . 
  citizenship is usually for the rest of your life , a government is more temporary . 
  there are plenty of hungarians who dislike the government . 
  since you did n't grow up with hungarian culture and language , you would indeed be ' a phony ' if you want to use this word . 
  but some people get really enthusiastic about their ancestry as an adult and then learn all this stuff etc. 
  but i think jews might integrate better into the jewish community of the new country and get rid of their connections to hungary more easily ( for historical and political reasons ) . 
  anyways , if you do n't have practical reasons and also do n't feel connected to hungary and the hungarians then i do n't see any reason to obtain hungarian citizenship . 
  well , it makes obtaining citizenship much easier . 
  but if you obtain your citizenship otherwise , then you 're still a full citizen . 
  being hungarian and being a citizen of hungary are two different concepts . 
  you wo n't become hungarian by being a citizen of hungary because `` hungarian '' is an ethnicity . 
  and vice versa , millions of hungarians are not citizens of hungary ( most live in neighboring countries ) . 
  summers are hot ( think 35 \u00b0 c ) , winters are cold ( think -10 \u00b0 c ) . 
  little rain compared to western europe . 
  usually not too windy either . 
  i like it quite much . 
  not really . 
  but one of hungary 's first internet memes ( not yet called so at the time ) was about the neighbor of a guy who was preparing for nuclear attack by building [ a nuclear bunker ] ( http://autoteszt.mandiner.hu/gallery/image/orszagjaro/hk3/18.jpg ) with 2 meters thick concrete walls behind his house in a small village , all by himself . 
  he built it around 1989 .
