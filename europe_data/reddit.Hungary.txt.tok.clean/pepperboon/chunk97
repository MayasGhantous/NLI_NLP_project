  there 's no distinct inner-city accent in budapest i think . 
  there 's slang and so on , but not really an * accent * . 
  i think we are more known than hungarians usually assume . 
  i know we are n't really famous and most americans have little idea about hungary , but we are n't totally unknown either . 
  i 'd say 7-8 even though the general idea here is probably 9-10 . 
   it used to be a joke that in texas , if you do n't have a truck , you might be gay . 
  having a truck feels more `` manly '' . 
  here it would be seen as a stupid waste of money . 
  the difference in wealth and costs means that it ca n't be an issue of `` manliness '' because most people just do n't have enough cash for it , so there 's no such pressure . 
   poor people are more likely to rent and poor people ca n't usually pay for no fancy `` moving companies '' so you and your friends have to do the grunt work . 
  that 's also a difference . 
  almost everyone owns their home in rural hungary . 
  and moving is not as common as in the us . 
  or in modern terms , the workforce is not really `` mobile '' . 
  and even as we do n't have pickup trucks , if you know many people then someone may have [ something like this ] ( http://images01.maxapro.hu/classified-images/001/001/590/273509/photo_peugeot-boxer-maxi-25-td-elado_1849031.jpg ) for his ( perhaps self-employed ) job or something . 
   when there 's lots of people around there 's this kind of pressure to be a law abiding citizen , you know ? 
  yes , i think that 's a difference too . 
  in hungary , we do n't really care much for oder pedestrians ' opinion . 
  but even if we did , it 's a socially accepted thing , so no problem with that . 
  but as i said , the mentality has disadvantages too . 
  this kind of overruling laws by common sense also means it 's somewhat accepted to risk not buying bus/train tickets if we can get away with it , not paying taxes is seen as clever and skillful etc. 
  i guess we do n't have such a big problem with the very fact of breaking the law if we think that there 's not much harm or risk involved . 
  i guess it 's partly due to the society 's experiences during communism where the rule of law in and of itself was not really something worthy of respect . 
  it 's just a strange/funny/stereotypical thing that basically all foreigners in germany notice . 
  even when there 's absolutely no cars anywhere around , a large group of germans will just stand there until the lights turn green . 
  even if there are absolutely no cars along the whole road . 
  ( i 'm not talking about risky situations , like `` i have enough time to cross before that car reaches here '' ) . 
  i can understand it and i can understand that the same mentality helps organize life in other aspects as well , but it is a cultural difference and people like to talk about such stuff . 
  because it 's low-tech traffic lights with just a timer and no traffic sensors . 
  you ca n't cross when it 's red lights for the pedestrians , you ca n't cross if there 's a nearby designated crossing place , and in hungary you can only cross major roads within cities at the intersections . 
  how is this not about jaywalking ? 
  you ca n't step on the road at all places , just where it 's allowed . 
  - extremely conservative , deep republican party stronghold : our uneducated village folk sometimes vote socialist , sometimes conservative ( depending on promises ) , sometimes far-right ( because of the gypsies ) - deeply religious ( bible-bashers ) : there 's no social group who 's stereotyped as `` bible-bashers '' in hungary . 
  religion is a much smaller issue here ( generally , in europe ) than in the us . 
  - lack of education : poor people without education exist of course ( among them many gypsies ) - extremely gun-loving : very few people have guns here - pickup trucks : cars are expensive to maintain and gas costs a lot more than in the us , especially compared to our low salaries , so no pickup trucks and especially not for poor people . 
  it 's a somewhat fake story . 
  the cattle-watching guly\u00e1s were poor village folk , they could n't afford beef so they never cooked `` goulash '' . 
  they ate cheap stuff , like cabbage , f\u0151zel\u00e9k-like food etc. 
  goulash was a tool of hungarian noblemen to show how national and patriotic they are in their opposition to austria and this fancy hungarian peasant food ( although just a romantic legend ) was good for the purpose . 
  it 's [ tejf\u00f6l ] ( http://img.www.nosalty.hu/files/nosalty_kepek/k421_dsc_0465.jpg ) . 
  usually translated as `` sour cream '' but it 's something distinct . 
  in germany you can create something tejf\u00f6l-like by mixing various amounts of sauerrahm , saure sahne , schmand and creme fraiche ( not all at the same time of course ) . 
  it 's a very basic ingredient in hungarian cooking , taken for granted like salt and bread . 
  it 's more `` basic '' than yogurt . 
  always causes a bit of headache when cooking hungarian style abroad . 
  the most popular names for newborns in hungary ( 2015 ) are the following . 
  in the nineties and 00s we used to have some political satire ( szesz\u00e9lyes \u00e9vszakok , f\u00e1bry show , heti hetes ) but i guess nowadays i think only heti hetes is left . 
  it 's 7 people sitting at a small table each and discussing the week 's ( mostly political ) news in a supposedly humorous way . 
  there is also sas kabar\u00e9 for the 65 + age group who have a nostalgia for socialism ( it 's very primitive and unwatchable for young people ) . 
  i do n't know anyone who knows it . 
  i tried showing it to english-speaking hungarians but reddit a bit hard to `` get '' at first so they did n't like it . 
  i also did n't start actually using reddit the first time i saw it . 
  discovering subs that you like takes ( too much ) time . 
  also there are just not so many people who enjoy reading/writing in english . 
  young people mostly do manage to use basic english if pressed but it 's a chore , not an enjoyment . 
  and you need a bit more than basic for reddit . 
  the first is poland , the rest is less clear . 
  perhaps croatia ? 
  i have no idea for a third friend . 
  not sure how it was in case of austria , but people outside the new borders of hungary ( 1920 ) lost their hungarian citizenship and got the citizenship of the country that took that particular territory . 
  if it was similar in austria , your father may have lost his austrian citizenship and got italian citizenship around 1919 . 
  if so , then you should have `` inherited '' his italian citizenship regardless of you place of birth . 
  so you may have been an italian citizen all along and maybe you just need to prove that this is the case and then you can get all your documents . 
  i 'm no lawyer , though . 
  sports are important but not school teams . 
  there 's no school-identity here . 
  there are n't really any significant school rivalries either . 
  the communities are rather on the class level . 
  a class is a group of 20-40 kids who go to almost all of their classes together and go to excursions together and so on ( i think the us has a more flexible/modular system ) . 
  people with similar interests ( or doing the same sport etc. ), 
  will also form groups across different classes and grades . 
  but this part develops organically , there 's no need for teachers or authorities to organize or orchestrate it artificially . 
  when the whole school gathers together ( usually in the school gym hall or the courtyard ) then it 's either the opening/closing of the school year or a national celebration/commemoration ( of revolutions and similar ) . 
  sometimes there might be a more `` fun '' reason as well , like we had a german-themed evening where we sang some german language songs ( we picked one by rammstein ) , but those are rare and not recurring . 
  the only big `` celebration '' we have is at the end of high school , when we do a ballroom dance and stuff ( or perhaps a carneval day in some schools called * farsang * but it 's not universal ) . 
  and most of the fun ( or parties etc. ), 
  that happens during this time of one 's life is not really at school but at someone 's home / some place in town or just gathering in a park with friends with some wine or similar . 
  there 's no need for any formal framework for these things to happen . 
  schools usually have a school newspaper edited by students but it also depends on whether there 's enough initiative for it by the students ( in my time we even created a blog-like website - today facebook might be enough ) . 
  school band is not really a thing ( except for music-oriented schools ) . 
  in hungary there are quite many i think . 
  but in the time of cheap flights , more and more people can afford to travel . 
  i personally have been to the sea , but `` longing for the sea '' or wanting to `` one day see the ocean '' is not really part of hungarian culture . 
  i personally like fresh water more than sea water , the salt irritates my skin , my mouth , salt particles stay on the skin after coming out of the water etc. 
  the sandy beaches make your clothes dirty , your shoe / sandals full of sand , it 's hard to walk on it as your feet sink into the sand . 
  i 'm quite fine with just swimming in lake balaton 's fresh water and chilling on its grassy sides . 
  if we count passing through on the motorway as `` visiting '' then yes . 
  if we only count the actual destinations then i 've visited 17 of the 19 counties ( and budapest ) and have n't yet visited tolna and b\u00e1cs-kiskun counties . 
  i think something like this is fairly typical . 
  we usually take many school trips so over the course of those 12 years kids tend to visit quite a few counties . 
  add to that some vacations at lake balaton/lake velence/lake tisza , and a few relatives here and there and it 's not hard to cover all counties . 
  it does n't mean much though . 
  the hungarian wikipedia is written by a bunch of people who think they know everything better than other sources , so they want to write things `` correctly '' even if the vast majority of people and books use another name . 
  like instead of `` xerx\u00e9sz '' they title the page `` khsaj\u00e1rs\u00e1 '' . 
  and many other stuff . 
  the discussion pages contain endless debates about how to deal with this , but the regular contributors/admins think wikipedia is their turf ... 
  wikipedia says [ eur\u00f3p\u00e9 ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/eur%c3%b3p%c3%a9_ ( hold % 29 ) for the moon . 
  that 's not really true . 
  before approx . 
  the industrial revolution people more or less lived in the same system , with the same values , same jobs as their grandparents .
