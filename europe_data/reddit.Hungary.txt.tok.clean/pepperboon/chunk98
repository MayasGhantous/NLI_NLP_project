  the acceleration since then has been vast . 
  it 's not the same . 
  perhaps * complaining * about how kids do n't obey as well as the early generations and the belief in gradual moral decay has been there for a long time , but actual generational gaps were much smaller . 
  today there 's a gap in understanding of cultural references , the general activities , the jobs that people do etc. . . 
  the 20th century also saw huge social change . 
  the form of state of european countries changed rapidly , kingdoms that stood for centuries or a millenium were abolished . 
  new ideologies like communism and national socialism took ground , people started going to school in masses , then pop music was born , movies , technology , revolutions in science and our picture of humanity . 
  today ( the last ~ 100 years ) is far from `` the same old thing as always '' . 
  basically people from any country in europe will say it 's their national characteristic that they like to drink and to complain . 
  referendum on migration quota 2 . 
  bomb explosion in budapest that injured two police officers ( not related to migration ) . 
  in hungary we do n't have such complex rules . 
  the only thing is that if you take the first exit , you * must * enter in the right lane . 
  if you take the 2nd or 3rd exit , you can use whichever lane you want . 
  there are of course places where you can see `` people that are very poor , people with bad hygiene , homeless people '' , it 's parks , underpasses , perhaps public transport at certain times in certain places . 
  i do n't usually see mentally ill people anywhere . 
  we have many overweight people and it 's a serious health issue . 
  heart disease is the leading cause of death , many people have high blood pressure , cholesterol , etc. 
  our cuisine includes lots of fat , starch , meat , cakes and not much veggies . 
  still we do n't really see the kind of extreme morbid obesity that seems to be commonplace in the us . 
  [ this kind of ( quite dangerous ) pot belly ] ( http://www.szon.hu/sorhas-verseny-szavazzon-on-is/1719158 ) ( scroll down to see several pics ) is not unusual , but you rarely see fatter people than this type . 
  [ this kind of fatness ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kukr1lsje2c/hqdefault.jpg ) is very very unusual here . 
  also our homeless are different than yours . 
  hungarian homeless people are rarely aggressive , they obviously have no guns , they are usually calm and rather lethargic people , they spend money on cheap wine and cigarettes and are usually thin . 
  you mostly see them sleeping somewhere or collecting bottles for recycling , looking for stuff in garbage etc. 
  they do n't spend much time in supermarkets since they are poor and do n't have money to buy stuff . 
   what changed between you and your child with regards to ethnicity ? 
  it 's called assimilation . 
  after a family ( lineage ) lives long enough in the country and marries estonians , adopts estonian culture and identity , the descendants will be estonians . 
  tribalism is in our human nature . 
  anyway , in many european countries this is just not even a question . 
  people know what it means and it means that . 
  it 's very rare that someone ca n't decide whether they `` qualify '' as an estonian or not . 
  and just because you 're not estonian by ethnicity , you can have full estonian citizenship and everything . 
  and if you think this is nonsense , how about ethnic minorities ? 
  would you deny the right of the ethnic hungarian minority in romania to call themselves hungarian by ethnicity ? 
  would you force them to consider themselves romanian , even though their mother tongue is hungarian , their parents are hungarian , their grandparents were hungarian , they identify with hungarian history and culture etc. ? 
  would you say that the slovak minority in hungary should not call themselves slovaks because it 's nonsense ? 
  in many parts of the world , countries and nations are n't the same . 
  a country is a state , a political entity . 
  the nation/ethnicity is a social entity . 
   there is no estonian ethnicity of course there is . 
  other countries have a different concept of ethnicity than britain ( like `` white , black , asian , mixed , chinese and other '' ) . 
  for us white is not an ethnicity . 
  it 's a race ( which is pretty ill-defined already ) . 
  `` hungarian '' is an ethnicity , `` polish '' is an ethnicity , `` estonian '' is an ethnicity , `` russian '' is an ethnicity . 
  wikipedia : `` an ethnic group or ethnicity is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities , such as common language , ancestral , social , cultural , or national experiences . '', 
   i only say hate because of the aggression it tends to bring to the discussion . 
  those who just roll their eyes do n't comment , just roll their eyes and move on . 
  this is like that in many topics . 
  everything seems like a bigger deal online than it is in real life . 
  because only those people write for whom it 's important . 
  in hungary , length up to human height is measured in cm . 
  we usually only say the prefix : deci means deciliter , centi means centimeter , deka means decagram , kil\u00f3 means kilogram . 
  they are a thing in si . 
  deci - and deca - are standard prefixes . 
  for scientific and engineering use they prefer to use only prefixes whose exponent is divisible by 3 , like kilo = 10 ^ 3 , mega = 10 ^ 6 milli = 10 ^ ( -3 ) . 
  correction : it 's written dl , not dcl . 
  why ? 
  because it 's simpler when precision is not that important . 
  when buying ham or cheese it 's simpler to say `` 15 deka '' than `` 150 gramm '' . 
  smaller numbers are easier on the mind . 
  with drinks we also say `` 2 deci '' instead of `` 200 milli ( liter ) '' or `` 0.2 liter '' . 
  much easier , sounds less overly-precise and pharmacy-like . 
  with shot drinks we also use cl and pronounce it `` cent '' , so a normal shot would be 4 or 5 cent , instead of saying `` 50 milliliter '' or `` 0.05 liter '' . 
  i was surprised to learn that germans do n't use these . 
  i still do n't fully understand how you should talk about such quantities in german in an everyday , relaxed context , and not sound like explaining a science experiment . 
  i know that 's the si standard , but in hungary we use dkg traditionally . 
  [ by population density ] ( http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/downloads/maps/nagdc/nagdc-population-landscape-climate-estimates-v3/place3-popdens-1990-europe.jpg ) , i do n't know . 
  and `` sociocultural center '' is very subjective . 
  it 's the center in the sense that the economic and political power is clustered there , but then you could also say that sydney is central australia , which sounds weird . 
  you do n't seem to know much about zizek . 
  there 's a lot of irony in what he was saying there . 
  that does n't really make it the center of europe . 
  but it 's very subjective , i just wanted to point out that it depends on who you ask . 
  for people around here , benelux is definitely western europe and not the center . 
  the center is rather around poland , czechia and slovakia for me . 
  the place where students protested does n't make it the center . 
  people can protest in the western parts too . 
   put the central countries in the center : germany , swiss , benelux danmark , austria and maybe czechs . 
  these seem to be the center for you because you just listed * yourself and your neighbors * ( w/o france ) . 
  if i look [ at this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/regions_of_europe_based_on_cia_world_factbook.png ) ( note that the dark pink is still europe ) , i 'd rather put the center around ( southern ) poland . 
  christianity yes , european colonial history yes , many people of european ancestry yes , speaks european languages yes . 
  conclusion : western . 
  christianity , greco-roman foundations , the enlightenment , influenced by the french revolution , 19th century nationalism and national revivals . 
  or basically europe + colonies that are largely populated by people of european ancestry ( so australia yes , india no ) . 
  [ here 's a askeurope discussion with over 120 comments from 14 days ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/51tz8b/where_is_eastern_europe/ ) . 
  my comment from there : it 's controversial , because here in the central european post-communist countries , we see it as a small part of our history that we were under soviet occupation for 45 years . 
  it 's not the defining characteristic of the countries and we 're trying to get rid of the effects it left on us ( most notably that these countries became a lot poorer and there 's still a stigma on them ) . 
  historically , we are a lot closer culturally to the other countries formerly under habsburg rule + poland and germany , than to russia , ukraine and belarus . 
  this goes for historical religious affiliation ( catholicism and protestantism vs. orthodoxy ) , cuisine , traditions for christmas and easter , all sorts of everyday things . 
  as to your second question , it 's not related to the question of eastern europe . 
  `` the west '' or `` western civilization '' inlcudes eastern europe . 
  it 's on the list . 
  you managed to start the shitshow for what ? 
  for pointing out that in some countries gender roles are more pronounced than in other countries ? 
  anyway . 
  by `` traditional gender roles '' i meant general things , like being protective of women and expecting men to fend for themselves , be tough and solve their lives . 
  i know that women worked , of course . 
  my ancestors up to and including my grandparents were peasants and my grandma did hard labor in the fields because it was necessary .
