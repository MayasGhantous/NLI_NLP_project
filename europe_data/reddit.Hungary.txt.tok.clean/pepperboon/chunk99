  but there were still big differences in roles and expectations . 
  for example women did n't go to the village pub to get drunk . 
  and of course they did n't do stuff that needed bigger muscles . 
  girls and boys were raised very differently . 
  girls were expected to be tidy , nice , mature ; boys were expected to be more mischievous and accordingly they were also beaten more by parents . 
  and many more things . 
  edit : now i can see your other answers in this thread . 
  do n't bother answering , i wo n't write back . 
  i do n't think this is a useful `` axis '' to measure countries on . 
  it 's more useful to think in the `` traditional gender roles '' to `` less gender-dependent roles '' spectrum in societies . 
  both kinds may benefit either gender in different situations . 
  this is a pretty nice nature documentary about hungary called [ wild hungary ( youtube link ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhhjoswmcx4 ) , but only the hungarian version is online . 
  there 's a dvd version in english . 
  ( it was sponsored by german tv stations , so it 's a bit cheesy in the beginning with all the fake-goulash-guys , but that 's what foreigners wan na see . ), 
  hungarian education is very different . 
  students do n't get to pick and choose this much . 
  we also do n't have semesters , the unit is a school year ( so subjects do n't change at half-year ) . 
  [ i wrote a comment about this system here ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/506nvf/in_the_us_and_canada_high_school_students/d74hg6a ) . 
  i guess we do n't think students are responsible and sensible enough to be given the choice of what they want to learn . 
  we 'd rather give them a comprehensive curriculum covering everything , and the option to specialize in a few subjects . 
  as far as i remember , the last year in my secondary school consisted of : * math * literature * hungarian language * history * english * one of german/french/italian / spanish * biology * art history and visual culture * society and civic studies ( not sure how to translate ; the basics of how states function , what is voting and so on ) * pe ( physical education - strength stuff , running , jumping etc. ), 
  optional , depending on where you want to go afterwards : * extra math * extra history * extra biology * physics * chemistry * it this is n't representative of all secondary school years , we had more science subjects ( geography , physics , chemistry ) in the years before , just not in the last year . 
  perhaps it 's somewhat different in belgrade ? 
  i can better imagine what you said if it 's about smaller towns ( = not belgrade ) . 
  when i read such posts , i wonder how our education actually compares to other countries . 
  it would be unthinkable to not cover things of such importance in hungary . 
  i think the hungarian approach is to cover * everything * , have kids read many pages , memorize years and dates and names , etc. 
  same approach with physics , where kids often just memorize lots of formulas and pattern-match on the question and mechanically use a formula . 
  there 's little regard for how much actually `` sticks '' after a few weeks from the test . 
  this is classic frontal education in the prussian tradition . 
  perhaps the more modern , western european + north american approach is to simplify things , skip huge chapters , but at least what gets taught is better remembered even by the less talented students . 
  maybe that 's better . 
  but i wonder when i see that a british person barely learns about the british empire , i wonder ... ( though i think it 's more likely in this case that op was n't paying attention at school ) . 
  this sounds very suspect . 
  you did n't say how old you are but you might be inexperienced . 
  why do you think the club posts those girls on the facebook page ? 
  as advertisement for guys to come and pay the entrance fees and pay for overpriced drinks in the hope of something happening with one of those girls . 
  and also to advertise for girls that it 's safe to go . 
  why do the girls go ? 
  it 's often cheaper or free to enter for them , some of them ( not all ) like to get free drinks from guys , some actually like the act of dancing in itself ( this is much rarer among guys ) , and yeah to show themselves off for instagram/facebook . 
  and perhaps the music , but i doubt it . 
  i do n't think guys * enjoy * the clubs as such . 
  in your theoretical idea , guys would also go to clubs if there were no girls around or just very few . 
  i 'd be surprised if that 's the case in serbia . 
  if you just want to go and get drunk with your friends why not go to a pub or bar where you can also * talk * to each other ? 
  it does n't have to mean that everyone has a good chance of hooking up with a stranger . 
  it might just be that you 'll dance and kiss , or you may go in a larger mixed group of acquaintances and the alcohol can bring some people closer . 
  hehe , yeah that 's real hungarian . 
  we went to croatia when i was about 12 . 
  it was interesting to see what the sea is like ( salty , mainly ) . 
   but neptun is n't ( or was n't ; have n't used it since 2012 ) compatible with chrome , and barely compatible with firefox . 
  i never experienced this and i always used firefox and chrome . 
  just like everyone i knew and i was also there around your time . 
  strange ... 
  yeah they dropped it around 2010 or 2011 . 
  ( and already in 2008 they held it in the central office and was n't given to the students ) . 
  and believe me the neptun is very very good in comparison to things i 've seen in germany ( custom made shitty websites for each uni , where you ca n't get half the stuff done and need to go get papers about your grades from profs and take them physically to the central offices , you have to ask the prof to correct things because your registration was not correct or you get some random error message , registering for exams in email or physically etc. ), 
  the neptun is sometimes overloaded when thousands and thousands want to log in in the same second when registering for exams , but all in all it 's a really useful thing . 
  you can basically do everything there without ever going to the central office . 
  maybe some features are hidden at an unintuitive place , but i never understood all the hate that this system gets . 
  actually that old booklet ( `` index '' ) is going out of use , too . 
  for example budapest technical uni students only have the online administrative system called `` neptun '' , there 's no physical book any more . 
  but actually you 're never forced to write in cursive , handwriting is always allowed to look like print letters , so those people next to you were probably just lazy ( or had some hand coordination problem ) . 
  well , we have some american chains , like mcdonald 's , burger king , subway , pizza hut , kfc . 
  in fact almost all chains are american ( for non-fast food we do n't go to chains ) . 
  there are also several non-chain us-themed restaurants in budapest [ like this one ( video ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwq8r9m9vq4 ) or [ this one ( photos ) ] ( http://www.sunnydiner.hu/foto2.html ) , and [ this is a hungarian mini-chain in this theme ] ( http://www.jacksburger.hu/galeria/hercegprimas-utca/ ) . 
  there 's a loophole if i heard it correctly ( i 'm not a lawyer , this is n't legal advice ) , that you 're allowed to carry it with the purpose of using it against animals , like stray dogs , but if the situation arises that you 're attacked by a person , you 're allowed to use things for self defense that happen to be around ( within reasonable limits ) , even if you are n't allowed to carry them for this explicit reason . 
  again , confirm this before relying on it . 
  funny how so many say `` complain '' . 
  i think hungarians complain way more and in a much more pessimistic/bitter/angry way than those other nations . 
  about everything . 
  about politics , about the boss , about the traffic , about the bus driver , about the prices , about the lack of money , about their health , about the doctors , about everything . 
  it 's actually very unusual and somewhat rude-ish to say too many good things about your life because it seems like boasting . 
  you always have to throw in a few things that are bad in your life . 
  this is quite a contrast to places like the us , where one always has to make it look like life is awesome and great . 
  i think many people move to writing the p and the b closed up instead of the open , official way . 
  or the s also often gets more like print , instead of that weird shape . 
  [ this is the cursive that children learn in first grade ] ( https://www.mozaik.info.hu/homepage/review/ms-1613u_02.jpg ) after a few years they do n't care how you write any more , as long as it 's legible , so most people drift to something closer to print letters . 
  ( in the first few years the `` looks '' gets graded as well , so content , spelling and looks are all graded . ), 
  i do n't think kids explicitly learn or practice writing print letters in school , they just learn to read them . 
  edit : btw , i do n't know why we teach this upright writing instead of the slanted one , but if you write slanted you get worse grades . 
  it 's quite uncomfortable and feels unnatural to write in this upright way , actually . 
  we hold the door , but do n't chitchat . 
  i did n't even have the concept of `` small talk '' until i learned this word in my english language studies . 
  we do n't have such a word in hungarian . 
  it 's just a different kind of culture . 
  yeah , but it would be even more complex if you flipped it around : `` do you agree that the european union should not be able to mandate the resettlement of non-hungarian citizens to hungary without the approval of the national assembly ? '', 
  it 's best to ask a question that is stated in the positive and not negated . 
  just a general point : according to modern descriptive linguistics , the language is what native speakers speak . 
  other things may have been part of the language earlier , or may be part of certain dialects/sociolects or the so called `` standard language '' ( the prescriptive , grammar-book-language ) , but all native speakers speak their native languages correctly . 
  except for extreme cases like mental illness / brain damage . 
  can you read hungarian ? 
  do you know what 9/11 is ? 
  should i translate the posters for you ? 
  they do n't mention 9/11 . 
  edit : i 'll do it for the benefit of all readers : did you know that ... * the paris attacks were carried out by immigrants . 
  * the number of illegal immigrants that brussels wants to settle into hungary is around the population of a town/city ( same word in hungarian ) . 
  * since the start of the immigration crisis , there has been a sharp rise in harrassment against women in europe . 
  * last year 1.5 million illegal immigrants came to europe . 
  * just from libya almost 1 million immigrants want to come to europe .
