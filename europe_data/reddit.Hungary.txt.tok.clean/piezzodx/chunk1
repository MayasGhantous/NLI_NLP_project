whatever you say mate . 
  except those who sell will also be hurt by this . 
  do you seriously not see this ? 
  also you are pushing the responsibility . 
  you leave , you will be outside the eu , imposing all tariffs , the default stance for any country outside the eu . 
  you act like damn brussels is fucking us over , like they decided so . 
  you decided , and you will bear the consequences ( sellers having smaller market ) . 
  acting like its even a possibility to lessen tariffs for uk imports , just because its the uk , not china or whatever . 
  just to make sure , but that goes without saying : no trade agreement without free movement . 
  baseline value , non-negotiable . 
  my god , you want special treatment even after you leave . 
  sour bitches . 
  which one ? 
  too many to count . 
  there are some new parties that are gaining traction but have very low support still ( 5 % ) , idk how but socialists still have significant support , only way out of this if the entire left and the far-right jobbik gets together - basically all parties apart from fidesz - , rewrites the election laws , then disbands the parliament , then new election . 
  did n't they remove the character limit ? 
  i read many articles in the past 3 years about that ... 
  too good , sadly . 
  they are far from neonazis . 
  the leader thrown out everyone that was remotely fascist in the recent years . 
  they are not going to win an election alone though . 
  lol i browse that sub quite often and the only posts that remotely has any connection to great hungary is lighthearted jokes , or memes specifically about mocking ourselves and our nationalist countrymen . 
  you make it sound like its some kind of far-right nationalist sub or something , while you saw two posts in a 6 month period that was some meme in hungarian . 
  red faction anyone ? 
  oddly familiar . 
  rend\u0151rs\u00e9g * but yeah , close enough to show it has nothing to do with poli lol, 
  finally a useful bot instead of those shitty cat and dog bots . 
  gypsies . 
  its literally official ... 
  well , if you like to get downvoted thrice the amount you would get , go for it . 
  funding leftist ngo 's , funds open society which goal is to have multicultural countries without any racial segregation . 
  this alone triggers an alt-right . 
  if we ca n't please anschluss us too, 
  so it begins ... 
  either you do it for free , or you do it for payment !, 
  come on out , soldier of soros !, 
  also it can be used as an adjective for something in series , so a resistor thats in series is called soros ellen\u00e1ll\u00e1s ( there are already memes about this ) , which funnily enough can apply to the government because of the meaning soros resistance . 
  everyone else outside germany i guess . 
  at least in hungary , private trackers are a big thing , thankfully . 
  yeah , very unflattering picture ... 
  these kind of sites are so cancerous . 
  insta ctrl + w for me . 
  me too please . 
  its not a thing here though , because both are equally illegal in the eye of the law , and the left does n't really say anything remotely denying thing . 
  we do n't really have marxists that are trying to make excuses for the crimes of communist regimes . 
  yes plz link, 
  your flair is `` united kingdom ( sorry ) '' why sorry tho ? 
  are you secretly canadian ? 
  one more reason to have him out of office instead . 
  arguably , but democratic . 
  ~ 40 % of the votes = supermajority in parliament and they were the ones that modified the voting districts to their taste . 
  disgraceful . 
   unwanted  unneeded lol , does n't seem like that in many cases . 
  lets see how the brits are going to do the jobs that they lost the guts to do it themselves , and they ca n't even acknowledge it from their wealth high-horse . 
  our incompetent left-wing does n't help much . 
  bigger parties also pull populist rhetoric , smaller parties ... well , they are small ... 
  so in these times , disallowing a university to operate under the same qualifications ( which would drive away all foreign teachers btw ) is a valid way of controlling influence ? 
  i think not really , and i am not okay with that . 
  in the mighty case of a very western-aligned government that would ban a very much respectable russian university that attracts people from all over the world is targeted by engineered laws , and its short deadline , and the surrounding propaganda created around it would hit off my bullshit detector really fast . 
  well , its still boosting the look of the country if people from all over the world would come here to socialize with others , and boosts the economy a bit becauss they buy stuff here but thats just miniscule . 
  just because the course list contains red flag words like feminism does n't mean all of it is cancer and to be frank , they could be teaching holocaust-denial for all i care ( its a uni , they can teach whatever the fuck they want ) , my country 's leaders have overstepped a bit , and they deserve every shit they get . 
  no financing , but the law indirectly targets the ceu . 
  basically the law requires the us goverment to form a bilateral agreement , which the us government is not allowed , only states can form these in the decisions concerning education . 
  the us government quickly pushed back the issue to hungary , they are not gon na make changes to their constitution just because of that . 
  not really . 
  * also cringes in hungarian *, 
  what the hell . 
  yeah , watched it on hungarian tv . 
  it was dubbed . 
  loved it as a kid . 
  interesting . 
  yeah , that is of course basic thing that you pay your employees more to work on sundays . 
  i think that way is more ideal , to pay everyone that works on sunday at least 100 % more , otherwise gtfo dear employer . 
  why have this day even in the first place ? 
  and only for stores ? 
  what warrants this law so it apply to stores only ? 
  what kind of logic is this ? 
  that 's what i am questioning . 
  construction workers does n't deserve to have a guaranteed day on their sundays , and if they want to buy something because of an emergency that not occures until that day , no store is open in 10 km range ? 
  i envy you very much germans , but thats just state unnecessarily meddling with people 's freetime , let the market and stores choose if they want to be open on sundays or not . 
  i do n't know what kind of `` arguments '' did the goverment used when it was introduced in germany , but in hungary , they used to say here that its for church , family and stuff like that . 
  there were a lot families that both worked on until saturday , and bought everything on the sunday , this law basically gave a reason to store owners to fire people , while on the other side favoring one small layer of society , while annoyed most of the population . 
  one of my friends who lived in a dorm bought her stuff on sundays , so it stayed fresh on monday , then the state came and said nope . 
  yeah , fuck that , introducing a bs law again , that 's what we really needed , no bigger issues if there are even an issue . 
  people gathered signatures for a referendum and the government did n't want ( again ) losing face so they decided to repeal it , but they said only because they wanted it . 
  two-faced bastards . 
  yeah , and what about other industries ? 
  restaurants ? 
  waiters and waitresses does n't deserve to be with their family ? 
  i am so fucking glad they repealed that law in hungary . 
  i was about to say that this library got a harry potter movie vibe to it ... 
  the following things are not one significant thing that you can just call `` yep , that totally transformed hungary into dictatorship '' , because change does n't happen overnight , be it good or bad . 
  first thing that indicates that some democratic principles were harmed is the modification of the laws concerning our voting system . 
  after 2010 elections fidesz made sure to stay in power and decided to modify these laws , by almost halving the number of meps , and because of that , they decided to also redraw the map of voting districts . 
  they also mangled some of the law concerning representation , and in 2014 , fidesz gathered ** 45 % ** of the votes ( with 62 % turnout ) , but they got ** 67 % ** of the seats ( 133 ) . 
  the leftist parties combined got ** 26 % ** of the votes , but got ** 19 % ** of the seats ( 38 ) , and jobbik got ** 20 % ** of the votes , but only ** 12 % ** of the seats ( 23 ) . 
  if it was distributed with respect to the representation , it would 've been around 89 , 50 , 40 seats respectively . 
  5 seat was taken by one of the smaller parties . 
  fears have been confirmed , the way fidesz changed the election laws actually benefited them more , and they again got 2/3 of the parliament . 
  gaining 2/3 of the seats means that the government can have more say in legislation , and they did n't wait to change some laws .
