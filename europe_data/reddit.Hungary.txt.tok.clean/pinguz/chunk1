i did n't know i was emotionally attached to the shape of the uk , but seeing the new one without scotland makes me kind of sad, 
  it used to be free for hungarians , but then there was a court ruling that it 's illegal to discriminate between eu citizens based on their nationality , so now everyone has to pay . 
  do n't ask me why it 's legal to discriminate between eu and non-eu citizens ... ( they have to pay twice as much . ), 
  wait for the `` beers of the eu '' thread, 
   hungary : looks like something you 'd have pay tickets to see ; almost too pretty you do have to buy a ticket ... 
  it 's around 5 euros for eu citizens , and around 10 euros for non-eu citizens . 
   what happened to hungarians ? 
  populism + millions of dumb fucks voting, 
  i did n't mind the crappy song , but the way she overacted the entire `` oh my god i got 12 points '' thing and desperately tried to look like she was crying was very annoying, 
  what happens when i am a match for someone ? 
  what exactly do they remove from my body , and how ? 
  is it painful ? 
  do i suffer any permanent consequences ? 
  do they hand out free candy in the waiting room ? 
  i do n't have time for all that . 
  we could start bashing gypsy bankers to save some time . 
  [ for those interested ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=87d_1388332237 ) ( nsfw obviously ), 
   since it 's something required for survival . 
  by that logic , should n't they also give you the food for free ? 
   social burial became free ... if the family prepares the body , digs the grave , lowers the coffin and reburies the grave . 
  ok , so is this really the stupidest fucking thing i 've read all year , or am i missing something here ? 
  why is this a good idea ? 
  what 's even more disappointing is that no one corrected him on the spot ... 
  i thought that anderson cooper was better than that, 
   retardest ** country ** in europe [ you 're not a country ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=vipm0guxw-m#t=89s ), 
  it 's only useless for what you are trying to read out of it ( purchasing power , from the employees ' perspective ) . 
  however , it could be useful from an employer 's perspective , who wants to get manual labour done in an offshore location , for example . 
  this map tells them where they can get the job done for the lowest salary cost ( see also : national competitiveness ) . 
  they do n't give a shit how many big mac menus their employees would be able to buy in the given country . 
  that name tag in his neck is so surreal somehow . 
  `` hrh prince henry of wales '' . 
  imagine being the owner of that name , and being able to write that into an amazon order form or something , because * you are actually called his royal highness prince henry of wales * ... 
  i guess i ca n't really put it into words , but i find it fascinating for some reason . 
  they sound like names from lord of the rings . 
  did tolkien use irish as an inspiration ? 
  our food is twice as good, 
  and the irish are the greyjoys, 
  maybe he meant a cap like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ae0hpxm.jpg ), 
  instead they are checking the other men 's asses, 
  oh ... you included hungary in true yurop ? 
  i like you . 
  \\* wipes away tear drop \\*, 
  6m x 0.5 m would be even better, 
   which i personally think is great why ? 
  well that de-escalated quickly, 
  awesome , we have our own colour !, 
  edit : fuck , cyprus ruined it . 
  also , you should make this a separate post , it 's too buried down here . 
  yep , i was one of those unfortunate students . 
  i still do n't understand what was the point of doing that . 
  thanks for nothing , laci b\u00e1 . 
  wow . 
  thanks . 
  yes , i 've been using the app , and i 've just had a look at the web version of the course , and it indeed has a lot more content , including grammar ... how stupid is this ? 
  i started learning irish through duolingo a week or two ago , but it seemed pretty useless . 
  it only teaches words , no grammar at all . 
  what 's wrong with you, 
  i 'm not a historian , but i do n't think it 's kadar 's death that started things ... 
  there had been plenty of build-up both inside and outside hungary in the 80 's . 
  1989 did n't happen overnight , and could n't have happened without a decade of things gradually softening up in the communist bloc . 
  read up on glasnost and perestroika for example . 
  ( also , you could argue that the transition is still not over , which would then make it 30 + years ... ), 
  til muslim is a race, 
  we are not arguing about that one , because he is obviously right , and i had a brain fart . 
  i could argue about the rest of his comment though , but it would n't make a difference . 
  everyone ( including flyingorange ) knows what the majority of these attacks are about . 
   i also ca n't remember the last time people burned down roma camps in eastern europe ok then [ here ] ( http://hvg.hu/vilag/20120907_molotovkoktellal_tamadtak_ungvar_egyik_ro ) is one for you from ~ ~ hungary ~ ~ ukraine earlier this month . 
  also , how about the [ widely publicized cases ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8215552.stm ) a couple years ago when strangers set roma houses on fire at night , and shot everyone who tried to escape ? 
  you have a very selective memory . 
   in 300 years ... we might all speak tarzan english or tarzan chinese, 
   gdp ppp ( 2011 imf ) edit : although op said it was ppp , you are right , these are nominal figures . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ) the ppp version . 
  why exactly did the swedish people reject the euro in 2003 ? 
  did they actually know and weigh the financial pros and cons ? 
  ( that would be impressive , considering they turned out to be right . ), 
  or were the voters divided along party lines , with an anti-euro party being more popular at that time ? 
  hungarian minimum wage : ~ 335 eur 1 ticket in budapest : ~ 1.15 eur ( btw i think that average wages would be more informative than minimum wages . ), 
  well i would n't say it 's politically incorrect , but i have seen people being butthurt over being called `` programmer '' instead of `` developer '' . 
  same as secretary vs. assistant , housewife vs. homemaker , etc. . . 
  do n't worry , whatever we will be called next will have the same stereotypes associated with it after a while . 
  this is how politically correct terms are born . 
  `` gypsy '' became `` roma '' , `` negro '' became `` black '' , `` black '' became `` african american '' , `` computer programmer '' became `` software developer '' , and so on . 
  and they never changed anything . 
  maybe their voting system is like reddit , and everyone starts with 1 vote, 
  too bad the song was n't in elvish, 
  til there 's a [ visegrad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visegr%c3%a1d ) in bosnia too . 
  i was confused for a minute . 
   in molecular evolution , a haplogroup ( from the greek : \u03b1\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 , haplo\u00fbs , `` onefold , single , simple '' ) is a group of similar haplotypes that share a common ancestor having the same single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) mutation in both haplotypes . 
  yeah that cleared it up, 
  retards . 
  [ 2002 results ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_parliamentary_election,_2002 ) [ 2006 results ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_parliamentary_election,_2006#results ) they were neck and neck at around 40 % each . 
   bucharest & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
   comparing how much data sms is and internet normally costs the sms should be about 1700 times cheaper making it the most overrated thing in the world that 's because it * is * the most overrated thing in the world . 
  sms messages piggyback on top of the communication that is constantly going on between your phone and the network even when your phone is not doing anything . 
  it should practically be free of charge , because it uses zero extra bandwidth . 
  ffs , do n't you have enough money in your national oil fund already ? 
  this is just unfair . 
  well we could inject them with tiny explosives at the start of their 4-year term , like snake plissken in [ escape from new york ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082340/ ) . 
  then when their term ends , we review their performance , and if they did a good job , we defuse the explosives . 
  if they screwed up , we let them explode .
