  tl ; dr i do n't know . 
  why ca n't we have a technocrat government ( `` szak\u00e9rt\u0151i korm\u00e1ny '' ) permanently ? 
  we have already seen in the past 20 years that there are no parties or politicians currently in hungary who would be able to run the country without fucking up everything . 
  i 'd really love to see what civilian professionals would be able to achieve when given the opportunity . 
   examining all the happening in hungary trough a very narrow viewpoint the irony in your comment is off the charts, 
  as you can see on the chart , one day does not really mean anything . 
  the exchange rate goes up and down all the time , but the long term trend is clearly visible , and has not changed yet . 
  but it has to change very soon , and the only thing that can reverse it is the imf loan , not the trade surplus . 
  hopefully the negotiations will be quick and we 'll wake up from this nightmare in a month or two . 
   the huf is currently on the rise ... what ? 
  [ eur/huf ] ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=1y&amp;l=on&amp;z=l&amp;q=l&amp;p=&amp;a=&amp;c=&amp;s=eurhuf%3dx ) [ chf/huf ] ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=chfhuf=x ) [ usd/huf ] ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=1y&amp;l=on&amp;z=l&amp;q=l&amp;p=&amp;a=&amp;c=&amp;s=usdhuf%3dx )  hungary had a $ 740.6 m trade surplus in september the main reason our trade surplus is rising is that households have less money to spend , so we need less imported goods . 
  the weak huf also hurts businesses that are dependent on imported materials , which further reduces imports . 
   as you say , he will be judged on the results . 
  the results are already in . 
  look at the forint , the high bond yields , the high cds , the lack of investor confidence , the growing unemployment , the lack of growth , the budget , and i could go on . 
  it 's time to change direction . 
  ( btw i 'm not the one who downvoted you . ), 
  thanks , me too, 
  yeah i was just about to point out that almost all of the comments have zero downvotes . 
  heartwarming . 
  i 'd happily trade our current government for a group of summer interns from gs, 
    fiscal council can veto a budget - i do n't see why this would be good or bad ...  not very democratic ... just to expand on why this is so bad : * the members of the budget council have mandates of 6 to 9 years * the council is currently filled with orban 's puppets * the council has the right to veto the budget that the parliament accepted * if the country does not have a finalized budget on the 31st of march in each year , the president of hungary ( who is also a puppet currently and has a mandate of 5 years ) may dissolve the parliament and order new elections so this means that ** in theory ** , even if ( by some miracle ) orban resigns and fidesz loses the next elections , they can just keep rejecting the budget and order new elections each year until they finally win again . 
  orban has been an iconic figure of the hungarian right wing in the last 20 years , so he had a large voter base ( or more like fan base ) to start with . 
  on top of that , the socialist party fucked up pretty bad in 2008 and 2009 ( and in the 6 years before that too ) , so many people who turned away from them voted for orban too . 
  and like i said there 's also the gullible masses who he has been feeding with populist bullshit . 
  bam , you have 2/3 . 
  btw the [ current polls ] ( http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/more-hungary/ ) are also worth looking at . 
  you can see that he has lost the majority of his supporters , but the other parties have n't gained anything . 
  people are just getting fed up with every available political party and do n't see anyone who 's worth voting for . 
   one has to assume that this is what the voters in hungary wanted . 
  you can certainly assume that , and you 'd be wrong . 
  replacing democracy with autocracy was not really a part of their election campaign in 2010 . 
  the majority of their voters did not want this , they were just gullible ( as usual ) . 
  the problem is that there 's no one left to support and vote for . 
  mszp and fidesz lost their credibility a long time ago , lmp are just a bunch of well-intentioned civilian laymen , and jobbik are far-right radicals . 
  maybe we should just outsource our whole political system to an indian consultancy firm . 
  they would probably do a better job . 
   `` hungary has past ** certain ** limits that serbia and other anti-democratic states did not '' meaning : some , not all  '' ... a `` ground law '' that eliminates ** or jeopardizes ** all its democratic institutions . '', 
  thats just exxageration . 
  though you can argue that there are anti-democratic tendencies , if you say that the new ground law eliminates all its democratioc institutions , you simply lie . 
  you are arguing with your own exaggeration here . 
  he did not say anything like what you are saying . 
   paul krugman is a fairly good economist and im sure , he is a good person , but again , he is not living in hungary . 
  neither are you, 
  yes , the part where he 's saying that i do n't want them hiding in canals is inaccurate, 
  [ m\u00e1kos bejgli ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bejgli ) ( or `` poppy seed roll '' , according to wikipedia ) is my favourite . 
  i could eat tons of it in one sitting . 
   in the past five years things have got better , with the 2006 world cup , which germany hosted , changing people 's image of the country everyone who needed to wait until 2006 to `` change their image '' of germany should have a talk with themselves, 
  where to start ... fidesz is trying to finance their failed economic model and badly timed tax cuts with one-off `` unorthodox '' measures like - `` crisis taxes '' on banks and telecom companies ( most of these taxes are against the law and eu regulations and will have to be paid back someday ) - forcing banks to allow people to repay their chf-based loans massively below the current exchange rate ( 180 instead of 250 ) . 
  the effects of this law alone could cause the austrian credit rating to be downgraded . 
  - seizing the assets of all ** private ** pension funds ( basically sacrificing the country 's life savings to finance one year of their unrealistic economic dreamworld ) - and now they are also trying to get access to the reserves of the national bank to finance one more year . 
  this is the last reserve of the country . 
  after this , there will be absolutely fuckall nothing . 
  so the net result is complete unpredictability and a lack of direction . 
  this scares investors away , which means - higher bond yields , making it more costly to finance the country from the market - no one in their right mind will want to make business here , because they do n't know when and how their profits are going to be seized - the country is starting to run out of its last reserves so paradoxically this means that the more independent they are trying to be from the imf , the more dependent they are becoming from the imf - because without the support of the imf behind us , no one is going to lend us money and buy our government bonds . 
  if we ca n't get this imf deal within the next 2 or 3 months , we are utterly fucked . 
  oh and to answer your question ... 
  many people still support them , because we are fucking uneducated gullible idiots who can not see through populist propaganda . 
  i think i need to start thinking about where to emigrate ( which i should already have done a long time ago ), 
  nationalism is on the rise in hungary too . 
  jobbik , a new far-right party , received 17 % of the votes in the 2010 elections , and according to current polls , they now have more support than the socialist party ( who were the ruling party from 2002 to 2010 , and received 19 % in the 2010 elections ) . 
  and in general , the current crisis gives nationalists throughout europe plenty to feed on . 
  one side will be saying `` why should we bail out other countries and pay for their mistakes '' , and the other side will be saying `` why should we let other countries tell us what to do , and force us to adopt austerity measures '' . 
  so if things get serious , i think it will be every country for themselves in no time , with populism and nationalism everywhere . 
  ( and i want to be wrong on this . ), 
  i knew about euler 's mathematical problem , [ the bridges of konigsberg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seven_bridges_of_k%c3%b6nigsberg ) , but i did n't know that it was today 's kaliningrad, 
  til about kaliningrad ( for shame , i know ), 
  i do n't think i can explain it any better . 
  read my comment again . 
  ** paying taxes is not voluntary ** , it 's not up for individual debate , not up for you to decide , ** it 's the law ** , it 's unconditional , and it 's the foundation of a working economy . 
  if your politicians embezzle the tax money , then they should be prosecuted , along with everyone who does n't pay taxes in the first place . 
  but you can not say `` you first '' and wait for the world around you to become perfect before you start paying your taxes . 
  people like you will always find an excuse , because politicians will never be perfect . 
  your mentality makes me want to throw up . 
  have a nice day . 
   greeks refuse to pay taxes , because they know tax money will not end up in productive use , but will get into politicians pocket there are so many things wrong with this . 
  i agree that corruption does n't exactly boost tax morale , but this is just an excuse to not pay taxes . 
  people cheat with their taxes because they can get away with it , not because of moral reasons . 
  simple as that . 
  and anyway , if you say `` if our politicians are cheating , then i am going to cheat too '' , then what makes you better than them ? 
  nothing . 
  they are corrupt . 
  you evade taxes . 
  you are the same as them , just on a different level and in a different role . 
  you are all doing something that harms your country as a whole . 
  if you want to live in a country that works , then as a citizen , one of the most important things you can help with ( if doing your duty can be called `` helping '' ) is by paying your fucking taxes . 
  if you do n't pay your taxes , then do n't riot when the government is cutting benefits that you did n't pay for in the first place . 
  if you did pay your taxes , and your government spent it all on coke and hookers , * then * we can talk . 
  i think you 're wrong , but you 're entitled to your own opinion . 
  i still want to reply to this , though :  politicians kept lying so did ( and do ) the greek people . 
  this crisis was not caused by the greek politicians alone . 
  read the following quote from [ this ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,790333-2,00.html ) article ( emphasis mine ) :  almost all of the many factories and warehouses in the industrial zone of komotini are now shut down , and yet they look as if they were brand-new . 
  komotini is a prime example of why the greek economy does n't grow , why it is uncompetitive and why there is no progress in the country . 
   most of the companies there never even opened their doors for business . 
  in fact , the ** abandoned buildings are the ruins of subsidy fraud . 
  their developers obtained funds and low-interest loans from the government in athens and from the eu to build the factories and warehouses , but they never intended to do any business there . 
  **  ** transparency international considers greece to be the most corrupt country in the eu ** . 
  permits and certificates can only be had in return for cash . 
  ** not everyone in greece sees this as a problem . 
  some see corruption as part of greek culture , and they also believe that taxes are unnecessary ** .
