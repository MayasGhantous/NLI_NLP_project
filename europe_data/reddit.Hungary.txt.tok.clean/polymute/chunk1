/ r/worldnews is forcibly being made to swallow the / pol / redpill these days . 
  not that these days this sub is better by much . 
  this is an ahmadiyya muslim mosque , that communitity is quite different from sunnis and shiites ( who in fact do n't want to call them muslims at all ) . 
   [ ahmadi muslims point out that as per islamic prophecy , mirza ghulam ahmad rendered jihad in its military form as inapplicable in the present age as islam , as a religion , is not being attacked militarily but through literature and other media , and therefore the response should be likewise . 
  are you quite alright ? 
  too much / pol / can have devastating effects on one 's sanity . 
  i hear the victims call it ` being redpilled ' . 
  right . 
  anything 's a nail as long as you only have a hammer . 
  by looking for ` homosexual propaganda ' in emojis ? 
  it 's easier than i thought . 
  not * everything * is about migrants , you know . 
   usa is funding isis wtf, 
  it 's ages old copypasta . 
  care to show some evidence ? 
   tablighis also are heavily criticized by militant deobandi islamists , such as the taliban , kashmiri militant groups , anti-shiite sectarian militant groups and jamiat ulema-i-islam ( jui ) for their apolitical stance regarding the war on terrorism , which many muslims perceive as a war against islam . 
  tablighi theology stresses that muslims must first devote themselves to becoming good , practicing muslims in their own personal lives , rather than struggling for political power or even protesting oppression by non-muslims . 
  this focus on the inner person first is the opposite approach to that taken by radical islamists , who seek to seize political power through force and then form an islamic state or caliphate that can impose shariah law on the individual . 
  because of this , some islamist militants accuse the tablighis of being a tool of the jews and hindus because they deny the need for a physical jihad and focus on the `` greater jihad , '' which is the inner struggle for faith and piety . 
  from the same stratfor article . 
  let 's not pretend we are experts on this group of people , let alone even heard of them before today . 
  that article , plus the [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tablighi_jamaat ) one are good points of reference for someone who wants to form an informed opinion . 
   the big money cronies behind this migrant influx that 's certainly new if nothing else . 
  not * everything * is about migrants , you know . 
  perfect dudebros . 
  * anyone 's got some beer to throw at them ? 
  * * dude , that 's a lawsuit waiting to happen with that company !, 
  that 's a nice amount of rationalization . 
  especially that big modern ship that just crosses the trafic . 
  just like that . 
  and then back again . 
   he only has mail permissions lol . 
  that 's new , maybe because of current events . 
  iirc he was pretty much beaten back the first time though . 
  edit : yes , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_p%c3%a1kozd, 
  it 's the biggest parliament building in europe iirc . 
  how on earth can you find it in yourself to be happy about people getting maimed or dying ? 
  are you ? 
  come on we have a full-on / r/whiterights outbreak . 
  croatia is not in schengen . 
  never all of it , jut a third . 
  this was the place where the ottoman empire 's expansion was stopped for 0 150 years and then reversed . 
  i thinks it 's a polandball thing . 
  the translation is indeed bad , it should be ` number of migrants apprehended in the last 30 days ' . 
  you are still on about this ? 
  that 's sad . 
  i 'm ignoring you in res . 
  your comment is poe-worthy too though . 
  oh no , our government hates the homeless . 
  and the poor too . 
  we just believe in something more than the basest drives of our lizard brains to drive our society . 
  someone tries to legitimize a neonazi party a week before the election , you can hover over thei username . 
  it shows how long they have been here for . 
  if it 's something ridiculous , like less than a month , it 's interesting to see whether it 's an actual account or just another sockpuppet . 
  using alts and sockpuppets * is * what derails the conversation . 
  edit : words .

  these two [ accounts ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3l0rnp/explosion_at_kurdish_community_premises_in_suburb/cv26s9l?contwxt=5 ) are a bit too obvious this close together . 
   redditor since : 2015-09-04 ( 11 days ) ` waking up ' these two [ accounts ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3l0rnp/explosion_at_kurdish_community_premises_in_suburb/cv273af?context=5 ) are a bit too obvious this close together . 
  it 's an 11-day account trying to legitimize a neonazi party . 
  you can guess why/how/what . 
  edit : and all his comments are about migrants . 
  this is pathetic . 
  word of advice : do n't try to get into scientific debates when you completely lack a scientific education in the field . 
  you misuse terms on a level ... let me find a metaphor . 
  your level of incompetence is like saying that americans reached the moon because they are taller than the russians ( while not knowing whether the americans or the russians are taller on the average , not understanding that it does n't matter and to top it off thinking tall means fat and average means median ) . 
  i bet you have n't even known that this exists , much less that you are demonstrating it :  [ the dunning -- kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein relatively unskilled individuals suffer from illusory superiority , mistakenly assessing their ability to be much higher than is accurate . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dunning%e2%80%93kruger_effect ), 
  it 's fuckebythenavel , thank you very much . 
  pronounced fukeeb aithenavel . 
  will be ? 
  yeah , a lot of scientific fields have the reproductability problem . 
  actually the whole of scientific discourse counts it as a topic de jour , some examples : [ biology and related fields ] ( http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002165 ) , [ pharmacology ] ( http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7391/full/483531a.html ) , whole [ nature special issue ] ( http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/reproducibility/index.html ) about the subject , [ physics ] ( http://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-don-t-cry-wolf-1.17859 ) . 
  scientific study is becoming more and more rigorous , these ( very basic ) concepts in psychology have been reproduced more times than you 'd care to count and to higher standards each time . 
  what you are linking to is an analysis of reproduction of articles published in 2008 alone and for the first time and they have been trials about sub-questions in established fields - quite unlike the concepts you seem not to be wishing to understand ( i guess because of some personal reason ) . 
  it 's a flashy article , but not the most substantive i 've seen . 
  good advice for anyone : read the article , not just the abstract . 
   cry more , butty boy . 
  i knew you were an [ agressive and interpersonally hostile person ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychoticism ) from the beginning ( i mean the account age alone ... ) , but you gave me an opportunity to show people some very interesting concepts . 
  i just could n't resist . 
  have a good one though . 
  there is a link to the full study in the article for you guys who are missing it ( and pretend to have read the livescience article , so that you can claim it misrepresents the article ) . 
  ( and also do n't believe in either ` so-called intellectuals ' , ` psychology ' or ` homophobia ' ) ( and also have very , very shiny new accounts . ), 
  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12975/full  #results  after a regression analysis , we found a significant predictive value of psychoticism ( \u03b2 = 0.142 ; p = 0.04 ) and of immature defense mechanisms ( \u03b2 = 0.257 ; p < 0.0001 ) for homophobia , while neurotic defense mechanisms ( \u03b2 = \u2212 0.123 ; p = 0.02 ) and depressive symptoms ( \u03b2 = \u2212 0.152 ; p = 0.04 ) have an opposite role . 
  moreover , categorical constructs of the rq revealed a significant difference between secure and fearful attachments styles in levels of homophobia ( secure = 22.09 \u00b1 17.22 vs. fearful = 31.07 \u00b1 25.09 ; p < 0.05 ) . 
  finally , a gender difference to hs scores and a significant influence of male sex was found ( \u03b2 = 0.213 ; p < 0.0001 ) . 
   #conclusions  we demonstrated the involvement of psychoticism and immature defense mechanisms in homophobic attitudes , while a contrasting role is played by neurotic defense mechanisms and depressive symptoms . 
  moreover , secure attachment is an indicator of low levels of homophobia compared with the subjects demonstrating a fearful style of attachment . 
  *** now that is hard to decode if you have n't studied psychology , psychiatry or any related field so let me help you out . 
   #psychoticism  [ psychoticism is one of the three traits used by the psychologist hans eysenck in his p-e-n model \\ ( psychoticism , extraversion and neuroticism \\ ) model of personality . 
  psychoticism refers to a personality pattern typified by aggressiveness and interpersonal hostility . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychoticism )  #defense mechanisms ( level 2 , immature )  [ these mechanisms are often present in adults . 
  these mechanisms lessen distress and anxiety produced by threatening people or by an uncomfortable reality . 
  excessive use of such defences is seen as socially undesirable , in that they are immature , difficult to deal with and seriously out of touch with reality . 
  these are the so-called `` immature '' defences and overuse almost always leads to serious problems in a person 's ability to cope effectively . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defence_mechanisms#level_2:_immature )  #attachment in adults , insecure style , fearful-avoidant subtype  [ people with this attachment style have mixed feelings about close relationships . 
  on the one hand , they desire to have emotionally close relationships . 
  on the other hand , they tend to feel uncomfortable with emotional closeness . 
  these mixed feelings are combined with sometimes unconscious , negative views about themselves and their partners . 
  they commonly view themselves as unworthy of responsiveness from their partners , and they do n't trust the intentions of their partners .
