  well it depends on how long a memory water has , anyway . 
  not exactly that but i ca n't believe that no one 's linked this video yet . 
  sorry i hurt your feelings . 
  anyhow i do n't care either way about royalty . 
  soo ... do you want to lay down on an imaginary couch and ramble on while i pretend to care ? 
  if not , i 'm giving up on you . 
  may her majesty have mercy on your soul . 
  meh , you just came across as a wanker with you ` i 'm feeling equal ' bs . 
  it reminded me of the euphoria permeating reddit so i said something to the effect . 
  now do you want to psychoanalyze this ? 
  talk about our mothers or something ? 
  cause otherwise i 'm done here . 
  ` in this moment , i am feeling equal . 
  not because of any phony monarch 's blessing . 
  but because , i am enlightened by the side of europe i live on . ', 
   the equality i feel do you feel euphoria as well ? 
   differences in cultures , i guess / s maybe we are more similar than we thought ? 
  the same buses we used to transport the migrants to vienna ( they used budapest public transportation buses ) after a night of service in budapest : http://m.cdn.blog.hu/bk/bkvfigyelo/image/bpi-19282.jpg http://m.cdn.blog.hu/bk/bkvfigyelo/image/ejszakai1.jpg hungarian youths having fun at budapest 's premier ` party park ' , erzs\u00e9bet t\u00e9r : http://jarokelo.hu/_data/_media_images/8365ef831b2d86459846ca1e6dd0a53f34c5664b.jpg https://img818.imageshack.us/img818/9739/8itv.jpg http://jarokelo.hu/_data/_media_updates/1366655523415_small.jpg, 
  your point ? 
  this one actually works in google translate , if someone else wants to see . 
  kuruc.info is an unabashedly antisemitic , racist , bigoted , all around disgusting site who routinely incite the same ( and much much worse ) kind of violence they show here - and have links to the infamous magyar g\u00e1rda - defy defamation laws by hiding on servers outside of hungary and regularily doxx normal human beings ( for example editors of the hungarian wikipedia ) . 
  it 's basically the hungarian version of stormfront , except it 's even more disgusting . 
  be careful of the friends you find in your fight . 
  that is a surefire way to make any default subreddit ( which this is ) gravitate towards memes , low effort content and other lowest common denominator stuff . 
  do n't take my word for it , look at / r/funny , / r/gaming , / r/worldnews , etc. 
  this is what i was referencing from / u/raerth :  ** please refrain from topic flooding : ** if the front page contains numerous articles on one topic , please do not post any more unless it significantly adds to the conversation . 
  yes , because half the frontpage is made up of ` stories which seem to imply a negative relation to the refugees ' . 
  this sub is / r/europe , not / r/euromigration , some other topics should have at least 40 % space for discussion . 
  as important as migration can be , other things are still happening . 
  when / u/raerth came back and created a sticky about the new direction of the sub , he said that the mods would n't allow one topic to drown out all the rest . 
  that 's what would be happening without active moderation and the sub would become much less useable . 
  leaving half the frontpage to immigration discussion and removing duplicates ( i have seen the kr bicske video posted three times * after * it reached the frontpage once and had is day in the sun ) and bullshit like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k2qzz/united_in_diversity/ ) does not an agenda make . 
  it 's janitorial mod stuff . 
  stop seeing conspiracies everywhere .

  it 's janitorial mod stuff . 
  stop seeing conspiracies everywhere . 
  there are no sides , do n't be paranoid . 
  be careful , someon over at reuropean will post this as a serious fear . 
  imagine how much worse this place would be with even less moderation . 
  we need more active mods , not less . 
  oh , i had at least 4 submissions removed by him for being duplicates ( they were , i 'm fairly active as a poster so sometimes it happens that someone posts the same news as me just before ) . 
  nothing insidious there . 
  filed under ` unpunctuated whataboutism ' . 
  it 's already past that point if not teetering on the edge . 
  once you go full retard/racist it is very hard to come back . 
   ( long-winded explanation of why it 's * quite possible * that * muslim women * have the capacity for self-determination of a child )  but ok , clearly i just hate women . 
  must be quite soothing to have such a simple view of the world . 
  that cognitive dissonance of yours ... it hurts , even from a distance . 
  we / r/worldnews now, 
  so is dubai . 
  wow . 
  you are showing a profound lack of empathy for the value of human life and when called out on it you do n't get why that 's a big deal ? 
  that does n't help your case at all . 
   although germanium is present in soil all over the world , it is difficult to extract , and most supplies currently come from china . 
  now scientists at freiburg university of mining and technology think they have found a revolutionary way to obtain it from their own soil - with a little help from the natural world . 
  china has used the price of germanium as a political tool in the past . 
  i never said it worked . 
  i do n't even actually remember whether it did ( maybe he used the police to enforce it ) , it was back in 2006 . 
  it was funny as hell though . 
  it 's no wonder i have set your tag in res to ` psychopath ? ', 
  i see . 
  the consitions are bad in the camps ( hungarian journalists went there - openly and disguised as refugees - and saw the same ) : it is not inhumane though , just overcrowded . 
  food and water a provided , sanitation is acceptable ( barely ) , shelter is overcrowded - military tents are being pressed into service , etc. 
  new facilities are under construction at the same time . 
  so a woman has the same capacity for self-determination in your eyes as a child ? 
  this is incredibly paternalistic . 
  a cogent argument . 
  when they tried it in budapest the mayor put up more than a hundred [ traffic signs ] ( http://img.index.hu/cikkepek/0610/belfold/traktor1.jpg ) prohibiting the entry of agricultral vehicles on the roads leading to the city center . 
  you should n't call someone butthurt and then proceed with a slew of persnal attacks . 
  it paints you in bad light . 
  i mean if you disavow your ancestors in the ottoman empire and shrug off the atrocities of turkey then there is not much to talk about . 
  you only focus on the pkk 's sins , which are magnitudes smaller than the modern turkish state 's ones and provoked by that very same hegemonizing state at that . 
  at least we can share the hope that the kurds break free . 
  other than that i 'll leave you to consider your country 's historical and current decisions that lead to it to this place alone . 
  turkey is a hegemonizing nationalistic state . 
  i have a strong distaste for such . 
  as for your ottoman legacy , you do n't get to use that as a shield - it is a mark of shame in the eyes of everyone but nationalistic turks , if anything . 
  your homeland has two legacies : that of an imperialistic ottoman state and then reinvented as a nationalistic ethnic cleansing state ( even genocidal , according to much of the world ) . 
  i do n't hold that against you individually , but it gives the kurds huge impetus to try to break free from turkey . 
  despite a hundred years of intimidation , forced assimilation and the like they still are separate from the turkish identity . 
  i find that admirable . 
  i would have understood . 
  parts of hungary were occupied by turkey , parts of kurdistan are . 
  hungary is a free country now though . 
  hence my sympathies with kurds . 
  i am from / r/hungary . 
  never seen / r/kurdistan . 
  maybe you mixed up the flags ? 
  i mean your country occupied both at a time and they look similar , but you were sent packing from hungary a long time ago . 
  the kurds were called ` mountain turks ' officially by the turkish government until not too long ago , as a way of denying their identity . 
  you do n't get to call any kurd mountain anything . 
   the migrants shat all over the buss the same buses ( they used budapest public transportation buses for transporting the migrants to austria ) after a night of service in budapest : http://m.cdn.blog.hu/bk/bkvfigyelo/image/bpi-19282.jpg http://m.cdn.blog.hu/bk/bkvfigyelo/image/ejszakai1.jpg those buses do n't have bathrooms . 
  and in budapest they stop at 5 minute intervals annd carry not infants and sick people but drunks at night . 
  your analysis is just the word of / u/thek9unit on reddit . 
  the reality is different . 
  hungary has had multiple military defeats , revolutions crushed , etc in the last 500 years ( after all , my comment was in rely to a turkish commenter ) , yet here we are . 
  not so easy to destroy . 
   `` we were given no food , no water , they are , in the refugee camps ( which are not closed , they only need to return at night ) , but they would n't go there . 
  so they are given food on the trains where they are striking , etc.
