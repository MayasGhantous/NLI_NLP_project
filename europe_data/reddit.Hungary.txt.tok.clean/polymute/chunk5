  i would n't have believed it myself , but i read an expos\u00e9 about an opposition journalist who pretended to be a migrant and came through the route - he was fed . 
  http://index.hu/belfold/2015/08/17/menekult_tabor_bentrol/  the police did beat us '' believe me if that were the case there would be a media outcry in hungary . 
  the opposition press ( which i read , since i vote opposition ) is eager to expose the government were they to let any such thing happen and they are allowed unrestricted access . 
  or maybe hungarian youths having fun at budapest 's premier ` party park ' , erzs\u00e9bet t\u00e9r : http://jarokelo.hu/_data/_media_images/8365ef831b2d86459846ca1e6dd0a53f34c5664b.jpg https://img818.imageshack.us/img818/9739/8itv.jpg http://jarokelo.hu/_data/_media_updates/1366655523415_small.jpg edit : the same buses ( they used budapest public transportation buses for transporting the migrants to austria ) after a night of service in budapest : http://m.cdn.blog.hu/bk/bkvfigyelo/image/bpi-19282.jpg http://m.cdn.blog.hu/bk/bkvfigyelo/image/ejszakai1.jpg, 
  i think it was the cross that was n't to touch the ground and it did n't . 
  one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter . 
  mountain rats ? 
  i guess the propaganda turkish children are given in school is working . 
  these kurds just want to have their own state instead of living in a turkish one . 
  would you like to live in a greek state as a turkish person ? 
  it is harder to crush a nations spirit and quest for self-determination than you would like to think . 
  sorce : look at my flair . 
  take a chill pill . 
  maybe we could have a ` not migrant-related ' flair . 
  ** then they should `` evaluate '' more before `` mistakenly '' killing 30 + civilians . 
  ** see ? 
  i can shout too . 
  *** as for erdogan - turkish police and counter-intelligence answers to him - he is responsible . 
  she wrote a book about the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roboski_airstrike . 
  erdogan might not be happy with her about that . 
  here you are . 
  having no credibility does make what one says less credible . 
  redditor since : 2015-09-05 ( 1 day ), 
  did n't you get the memo ? 
  everything , and i do mean * everything * , must only be talked about how it relates to the migrants . 
  no other modes of discussion allowed . 
  this subs quality has really taken a nosedive in the last few months . 
  medical science and psychology disagree with your centuries-out-of date assessment . 
  did you know that the church actively supressed autopsies for centuries leading to a very low anatomical knowledge base in europe in the middle ages ? 
  that caused countless deaths . 
  your metaphor , such as it is , is more in line with that policy than anything valid in the 21st century . 
  the world is changing and it 's only going to change faster . 
  50 years ago it would have been impossible to make a person with gender dysphoria whole . 
  now there is a chance . 
  they need to get with the times if they do n't want to lose influence . 
  the vatican does move , it just takes a lot of impetus . 
  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rerum_novarum for example . 
  indeed . 
  even the article 's byline is ` part of much wider trend to demonise encryption , perhaps with a view to banning it . ' . 
  very worrying developments . 
  germany strongly suggested that we honor the passport-protocols ( i. e. do n't let them through ) about a day after they announced they would welcome all syrian refugees . 
  it 's really weird how this keleti situation happened just right now . 
  serbia does though . 
  you do n't vote for policies a party proposes individually , you vote for the whole platform . 
  that was the point of the metaphor . 
   redditor since : 2015-07-29 ( 1 month and 3 days ) comes over from reuropean . 
  but there is no brigading here , anyone who thinks so must be crazy . 
  i guess then i should vote for jobbik then because they promise social benefits to * my kind * ( non-jewish white hungarians ) and ignore their incompetence and antisemitism . 
  not at all . 
  there was this vibe that it was a very taboo thing to do , to drink , which only young students or foreigners would admit to doing . 
  of course that was different for arab christians but even they were n't ` flaunting it ' so to speak . 
  like it was allowed because of the state ideology which was secular and enjoyed/suffered by people because it is well ... alcohol , but it was n't an aboveboard thing . 
  alcohol was n't easy to come by though it was perfectly legal before the civil war . 
  there were these delicatessen like places in damascus where you could buy beer , some okayish lebanonese wine and arak , in addition ( really an afterthought ) to food items , but not in caf\u00e9s or restaurants , that was very strict . 
  as opposed to freshly minted reddit accounts ? 
  i wonder who , what he is . 
  look , you are about the only person here who actually tries to deny that the front page is littered with migrant/muslim threads . 
  all the others are just saying that those threads should occupy as much of the main space of this subreddit as they are , because they merit that much attention . 
   oh my god some people are just so blinded by ideology . 
  indeed . 
  so you should take a good look at yourself before resorting to personal attacks . 
  wow , this sure was downvoted in / new before people could have got a chance to see it . 
  you should make a post about this in this sub . 
  actually looking for a moment of respite from the flood of migration submissions to take your screenshot is the actual cherrypicking . 
  you just gave me some hope . 
  same here . 
  only here and only when it comes to migrants , muslims , non-white people or lgbt issues . 
  whn i was young i would think the the budapest opera building was black . 
  but after the renovation i realized that it 's colour was in fact closer to white . 
  after some years it looks like [ this ] ( http://bebudapest.hu/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/budapest_state_opera_house2.jpg ) . 
  where could he hope to get voters ? 
  that kind of protest vote is already spoken for in the south , and basically no one would vote for varoufakis ' party in the north . 
  does he want to assimilate podemos and the 5 star movement ? 
  i do n't think they would go for his leadership . 
  the differences and ( sometimes ) the euroscepticism is too high . 
  hell yes . 
  well at least we would be able to see whether they actually want a discussion or rather just want to plaster alarmist posters on every available space . 
   i was wondering about a daily immigration megathread , but unlike the last one it would be driven by auto-moderator on a schedule that would be a good improvement . 
   we would not ban submissions outside of it . 
  that would completely defeat the purpose of the idea though . 
  the frontpage would still be cluttered with the individual pieces of news - just with maybe less conversation . 
  other kinds of conten would still not be as visible to most users as it was before this drama . 
  people actively showing their care in this thread ( narrow definition ) on the sub ( broad definition ) by speaking out agaist it . 
  other questions over semantics ? 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3i5mu3/what_are_your_favorite_nonenglish_speaking/ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3i7mc4/what_is_favourite_city_outside_of_your_homebase/ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3i7ug9/football_fans_of_reurope_is_it_common_for_people/ these kinds of discussions were more likely to reach the front page and actually turn into more before it became about ` migrants at the gates ' . 
  i do n't chose , people generally only care about the period of this drama on this sub ( from the early summer on ) . 
  new accounts during that time who mostly only post here about immigartion or related topics are pretty obvious though . 
   i do n't think that the age of an account is evidence of it brigading . 
  if you do n't think there is a ccorrelation than you might be either disingenious , slow or you might have political blinders on . 
  when it 's being brigaded about a political topic the numbers obviously shift , but in its normal state there is a lot more to / r/europe 's content than just news articles . 
  these brigades did start in the last few months . 
  and he is not at all alone in this - as much as the 1-month-old account in this thread and its likes would argue that there is no brigading , they are just ironically give weight to the likelihood that there is . 
  am i ? 
  5 months * was * before the immigration drama of this sub though , unlike your registration wich is smack dab in the middle of it . 
   redditor since : 2015-07-23 ( 1 month and 4 days ) it 's a bit rich that this account is arguing against brigading . 
   disqualify the candidates who get lots of votes from migrants and double voters . 
  because a lot of this frenzied new activity comes from new accounts . 
  funny metaphor , is n't it ? 
  i never knew about that !, 
  i really wish i could take part though - might do it sometime even .
