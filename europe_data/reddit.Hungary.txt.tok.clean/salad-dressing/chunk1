he 's viewed negatively by young people , and favored by the older population . 
  but sadly , the older citizens vote more frequently than the youth . 
  my instinct is to downvote you , but sadly you 're right : - /, 
  50 years of collective suffering . 
  we hate putin . 
  he 's not saying public works projects are sinister in general . 
  the way it 's being executed in hungary in 2014 is not the same as it was executed in the united states in the 1930 's . 
  there are differences . 
  george washington , fdr , lincoln ? 
  there are actually quite a few if you 'd take a moment to think about it , in exchange for reflexive , instantaneous cynicism . 
  he 's referring to b\u00e9la kun 's somewhat obscure hungarian soviet republic which lasted for 5 months in the year 1919 , not the post wwii hungary . 
  kind of but not really . 
  the magyars came from khazaria . 
  the huns originally came from asia , but there 's not a direct connection between the huns and the magyars . 
  the language has it 's roots in asia , but the people speaking that language today are likely not direct genetic descendants of asians . 
  but you 're right in that the original 12 tribes which came over from khazaria ( which is in modern day turkey ) in the 9th century were ethnically heterogeneous . 
  in graves that have been excavated from that time period they 've found bodies with asiatic features as well as whites and middle-easterners . 
  khazaria was a crossing point between europe , asia , and the middle east . 
  the original magyars were a mix to begin with , and they are believed to have been kazars which broke free and formed their own nation to the west . 
  fuck the ayatollah . 
  i currently live in debrecen , and lived in p\u00e9cs prior to that . 
  around here , very few people speak english fluently/well enough to hold a conversation . 
  really . 
  you probably live in budapest . 
  you do n't know anyone ?? 
  hungary in last place . 
  ouch . 
  that 's seems pretty accurate . 
  europe is weird ? 
  okay 12 year old little boy . 
  whatever you say . 
  fuck the jobbik nazi scum . 
  they blame all the economic problems on the gypsies getting welfare . 
  unfortunately it 's far too easy to convince the desperate and uneducated folks here , that that 's the problem . 
  they do n't even have a platform . 
  they do n't have any realistic policy goals . 
  i wonder if the people of ukraine will still want to join the european union after displaying such gutlessness in helping them , or rather , not helping them . 
  censoring comedians who make racial jokes is not the right way to go about things . 
  i know a lot of people hate this guy , but that 's the sacrifice we have to make when we live in a free country . 
  if we want freedom of speech , we have to make the small concession that we may be offended from time to time . 
  are you really willing to give up freedom of speech in order to avoid having your feelings hurt by some idiot ? 
  censorship is not the way forward . 
  it 's these kinds of situations where people should be standing up , and saying `` i do n't agree with what this guy says , but i support his right to say it . '', 
  the government should not be allowed to regulate on who can perform live comedy , and who ca n't . 
  what kind of jokes you can make , and what kind you ca n't . 
  once they have that power , they 'll more than likely abuse it . 
  tl ; dr it does n't matter if this guy is a jerk . 
  he should be allowed to be a jerk . 
  that 's part and parcel of living in a free country . 
  it is called moldavia in many non-english languages . 
  spanish for instance , as well as the nordic languages . 
  and the independent state `` rafa nadal '' :-), 
  stating that it 's their own fault is pretty unnecessary . 
  it 's a great read . 
  in 1910 it was 15 % slovakian . 
  that 's what it said in the last link you posted . 
  i used your own link to derive that number . 
  then i posted links and quotes directly from wikipedia specifically stating , that bratislava was part of hungary from the early 10th century , until the early 20th century . 
  it was the ** capital fucking city ** of hungary . 
  you do n't see any rational justification ? 
  for the former capital city of hungary being part of hungary ? 
  did you not read any of what i wrote in my last comment ? 
  i 'm guessing you did n't . 
  you 've also sneakily shifted the demographics from the city of bratislava , which is what we were discussing , to the entire county . 
  we were n't talking about the county , we were talking about the city of bratislava . 
  what was the capital of slovakia in the 19th century ? 
  that was a rhetorical question . 
  slovakia did n't exist in the 19th century . 
  here 's what happens when you type `` slovakia '' into wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovakia#kingdom_of_hungary_.281000.e2.80.931919.29 tl ; dr it was a hungarian territory for 919 years . 
  the country was under ** partial ** ottoman occupation . 
  bratislava was ** not ** occupied by the turks , ** therefore ** it became the capital of hungary , which is quite clear to understand . 
  that 's why it became the capital city , because it was not occupied . 
  furthermore , hungary remained a continuous kingdom , as i highlighted , as an autonomous region within a joint empire . 
  there was a dual monarchy . 
  hungary remained an autonomous entity , but part of something greater . 
  i specifically highlighted the important number of ** 946 years ** in my previous comment . 
  you can choose to not believe wikipedia . 
  i ca n't really say more than i 've already said . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_habsburg the house of habsburg was one of the most important royal houses of europe . 
  the throne of the holy roman empire was continuously occupied by the habsburgs between 1438 and 1740 . 
  the house also produced kings of bohemia , england , germany , hungary , croatia , ireland , portugal , spain , as well as rulers of several dutch and italian countries . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungary following periods of successive habitation by celts , romans , huns , slavs , gepids , and avars , the foundation of hungary was laid in the late 9th century by the hungarian grand prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d . 
  his great-grandson saint stephen i ascended to the throne in 1000 ad , converting the country to a christian kingdom . 
  ** the kingdom of hungary existed for 946 years ** and at various points was regarded as one of the cultural centers of the western world . 
  after the battle of moh\u00e1cs and about 150 years of partial ottoman occupation ( 1541 -- 1699 ) , hungary became part of the habsburg empire , and later formed part of the austro -- hungarian empire ( 1867 -- 1918 ) . 
  hungary 's modern borders were first established by the treaty of trianon ( 1920 ) after world war i. 
  the country lost more than 71 % of its territory , 58 % of its population , and 32 % of the hungarians . 
  based on your previous comment , where you demonstrated your marginal knowledge on the subject . 
  you `` doubt '' the country even existed . 
  i posted this already . 
  but you should read it . 
  you and some others seem to think that the city was never really hungarian . 
  that 's what i 'm arguing against . 
  i do n't think we have a right to claim it as ours in the present day . 
  but you and some others are mistaken when you say those cities were never hungarian . 
  from wikipedia : bratislava the first written reference to a settlement named `` brezalauspurc '' dates to ** 907 ** and is related to a battle , during which a ** bavarian army was defeated by the hungarians . 
  ** it is connected to the fall of great moravia , already weakened by its own inner decline and under the attacks of the hungarians . 
  in the ** 10th century ** , the territory of pressburg ( what would later become pozsony county ) became part of hungary ( called `` the kingdom of hungary '' from 1000 ) . 
  it developed as a key economic and administrative centre on the kingdom 's frontier . 
  this strategic position destined the city to be the site of frequent attacks and battles , but also brought it economic development and high political status .
