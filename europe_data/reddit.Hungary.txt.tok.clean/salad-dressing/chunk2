  from wikipedia : bratislava the first written reference to a settlement named `` brezalauspurc '' dates to ** 907 ** and is related to a battle , during which a ** bavarian army was defeated by the hungarians . 
  ** it is connected to the fall of great moravia , already weakened by its own inner decline and under the attacks of the hungarians . 
  in the 10th century , the territory of pressburg ( what would later become pozsony county ) became part of hungary ( called `` the kingdom of hungary '' from 1000 ) . 
  it developed as a key economic and administrative centre on the kingdom 's frontier . 
  this strategic position destined the city to be the site of frequent attacks and battles , but also brought it economic development and high political status .

  you wrote a comment in response to mine below , which i was in the process of responding to but you deleted it . 
  it said ... `` based on that logic , slovakia/felvid \u00e9k should not exist '' this would have been my answer . 
  it should exist , but bratislava should not have been a part of it . 
  like it says in the link you posted ... at the onset of wwi , the city was 42 % german ( austrian ) , 41 % hungarian , and 15 % slovakian . 
  handing over a city to the country of slovakia , a country that the city had never belonged to in its history , where 85 % of the population are non-slavic , certainly baffled more than a few people . 
  you could argue over whether it was more germanic , or more hungarian , but slavic ? 
  it is what it is . 
  borders and boundaries have changed . 
  wars have taken place . 
  it 's long in the past , but it really never was a slavic city . 
  and to pretend that it ever was prior to that , is revisionist history . 
  you doubt it ? 
  based on what ? 
  it 's a fact ... use a search engine , and type in hungary . 
  then read a bit about it . 
  `` in the 10th century , the territory of pressburg ( what would later become pozsony county ) became part of hungary ( called `` the kingdom of hungary '' from 1000 ) . '', 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bratislava#history in which country is dallas , texas ? 
  miami , florida ? 
  san diego , california ? 
  would you say those cities are in the united states ? 
  or are those cities in mexico ? 
  within these massive cities , one may hear the spanish language spoken as often as the english language . 
  either now , or in the not too distant future . 
  in many us cities , especially in the south , spanish is native language spoken by a majority of the local population . 
  yet these cities are not in mexico . 
  that applies here as well . 
  bratislava was right on the border with austria to the west , and with more slavic territories to the north . 
  of course you were going to hear those 3 languages spoken by many people . 
  that does not negate the fact that the city was inside the borders of hungary from the 900 's until the 1900 's . 
  at no point in time was the city of bratislava not within the borders of hungary for almost one thousand years . 
  having large groups of minorities in one of your cities does not make it a foreign city . 
  no city is `` purely '' anything , but bratislava was a city inside the country of hungary , or kingdom of hungary from the 10th century until the 20th century . 
  was there a minority of germans and slavs living there ? 
  probably . 
  obviously no city is `` pure '' nor should it be . 
  but the city was inside the border of hungary for 900-1000 years before the country of slovakia was created . 
  bit of a tangent from the topic of transylvania though . 
  i would have guessed that the percentage was higher than just 6 % ( although that number was for the entire country , not transylvania ) , but after 3 generations , the cultures have intermarried , and the 3rd generation now , while perhaps still holding onto hungarian family names , are mixed-ethnicity , and may likely no longer feel such a close tie to their grandparent 's and parents ' native land that they 'd fight for autonomy . 
  i really ca n't see this ever happening . 
  after trianon , the romanian government moved ethnic romanian families into transylvania so as to dilute the region , and that has certainly come to fruition . 
  the empire of austria-hungary certainly overstepped their bounds , and took many lands to which they had no rightful claim . 
  when they were punished after the wars , they lost many lands to which they did have rightful claim . 
  it 's somewhat unfortunate , but it was the cost of going too far . 
  bratislava ( pozsony ) is another example of a city which was purely hungarian for 900 years prior to the world wars , and it was just taken away . 
  large parts of transylvania fall into that same category , including cluj ( kolozsv\u00e1r ) , but far too much time has passed since the two world wars ( during which time there was something of a back and forth ) . 
  the amount of people that believe strongly enough in this to protest for it is nowhere near enough . 
  most hungarians have long ago accepted this as a reality , and i think most transylvanians have too . 
  it 's always `` national security '' is n't it ? 
  releasing information to the public ? 
  national security threat . 
  the common people knowing what 's actually happening , that 's the biggest threat of them all . 
  national security is the new `` protecting the children . '', 
  the reason being ... `` we are determined to further reduce rates of smoking and believe this important step today will help . '', 
  we really are ignorant . 
  they want to reduce rates of smoking . 
  if only we had known , we would n't have mocked the increase in size of the warning labels from 40 % of the pack to 65 % . 
  it all makes sense now . 
  that 's the problem ... people could n't read the warnings !, 
  this is far more disgusting than pornography . 
  it always seems to be in the name of `` protecting the children . '', 
  government overreach , and a step toward the primitive . 
  i think he 's a troll . 
  all of the underwater mediterranean kingdoms in the deep-sea speak hungarian . 
  but with a weird southern accent . 
  is it accurate that they had the civilians move the bodies of the ones that had already been executed before then killing those guys as well ? 
  i fast-forwarded but that 's the impression that i got , which is devastating . 
  no , you do n't get it . 
  numbers do n't lie . 
  the strategy worked . 
  he got the extra votes he wanted by implementing this strategy . 
  why are you so upset ? 
  that 's what happened . 
  obviously not all of them voted for him , in fact , most did n't vote at all . 
  only a child would conclude that that should be the takeaway from what i wrote . 
  in order to win a super-majority he handed out millions of hungarian citizenships ( 4-5 million i believe it was ) to ethnic hungarian people living in former territories such as transylvania , slovakia , serbia . 
  this gave many of them eu status or schengen status . 
  most of these people living outside of modern day hungary and unaware of internal politics here , voted for him and his party because they gave them citizenship .
