[ no need for photoshop really . 
  well the hungarian example you gave is more of a stutter or speech filler than anything . 
  was that the case in the german post ? 
  my german is pretty rusty , i just saw the thes and assumed something was being said that needed different forms next to each other . 
  all ... all those `` the `` s. it 's like a nightmare of my german class . 
  how many representatives ? 
  she said dublin iii treaty is upheld by germany , but not enforced for syrians . 
  / timid, 
  my dad changed our last name simply because he was tired of spelling it out to people . 
  although now we get to say `` doe , as in john doe '' ... 
  hey !, 
  sounds like what i got here in the us for my masters !, 
  no tuition + enough money to be * just * above the poverty line . 
  except i live with my parents and the money i get is going into my previous school debts ... 
  ha , whoops . 
  did n't notice the sticky . 
  it is pretty surprising now that you mention it . 
  lol . 
  maybe i am the idiot people tell me i am . 
  reread your pdf and i see where you got the numbers from . 
  how do you explain my link ? 
  according to that , crime has n't increased in sweden . 
  in fact burglary has been * decreasing * since 1993 . 
  i 'm not sure we 're reading the same pdf ... sweden is on the lower end of things on all crimes except for rape ( as far as i can tell ) . 
  [ plus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_sweden ) , the number of crimes reported per 100,000 population has stayed relatively the [ same ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:number_of_crimes_reported_per_100,000_population_in_sweden,_1993-2013.svg ) , except for rape which has been increasing since around 2001 . 
  no , [ that is not quite true ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:countries_of_origin_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_seekers_in_the_eu-28_member_states,_2013_and_2014_yb15_iii.png ) . 
  the vast , vast majority of asylum seekers are from war-torn countries like syria , afghanistan , and kosovo . 
  so , refugees . 
  [ more statistics ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/category:asylum_and_migration ), 
  are there any statistics on the rate of marriage , and percentage of young , single men in the countries you are talking about ? 
   chances are that the majority of them are single , young and able men i agree this is a possibility , but i can not find data that can confirm or deny it . 
  the rest of the post is more assumptions and stereotypes , although if there is data to back it up i would definitely like to take a look . 
  i appreciate your highly informative post !, 
   this point seems to be constantly raised ; i 'm not sure if it 's opaquely trying to point out that a great many people are actually economic migrants ( which seems totally valid to me ) , but i wish that people would just explicitly make the statement . 
  i brought up those questions as genuine confusions i would like to find answers to . 
  the data shows that the vast , vast majority of asylum seekers come from war-torn countries . 
  it also shows that 75 % of these people are male . 
  i am trying to make sense of this data . 
   men are supposed to be the only provider in their society and are expected to lead . 
  well , right . 
  in my head i was imagining/expecting that a man leads his family out of those countries , trying to protect them as best they can on the journey . 
  if my wife and children ( remember that accompanied children are roughly equal in terms of sex ) were utterly dependent on me for survival , i would like to think i would bring them with me . 
  my idea is a very hollywood notion though , which is why i am looking for sources that can give facts on the issue . 
  even so , i ca n't imagine the journey being easier even if money was being sent to the family left behind . 
  ( and sent how ? 
  these countries do n't exactly have an atm on every corner ) . 
   if they eventually make it in austria or germany they will either send money back home or do anything possible to bring their family there . 
  yeah this was my other question . 
  if this is the case , is europe looking forward to an influx of women and children in the future ? 
  i think this is the most plausible theory . 
  i think i was assuming the vast majority of asylum seekers were family men . 
  do you know of any statistics on how many families v single persons are seeking asylum ? 
  i do n't think that eurostat article divides down that far . 
   and the family members do n't have to apply for asylum individually , so they do n't end up in the statistic . 
  this would definitely explain the numbers . 
  however all genders and ages were mentioned [ in this graph ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:share_of_male_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants_in_the_eu-28,_by_age_group_and_status_of_minors,_2014_%28%25%29_yb15_iii.png ) : * child ( < 14yo ) accompanied applicants : 54 % were male * child ( < 14yo ) unaccompanied applicants : 86 % were male * teen and young adult ( 14-34yo ) applicants : 75 % were male * adult ( 35-64yo ) applicants : guesstimated 68 % were male * elderly (  65yo ) applicants : guesstimated 44 % were male it 's these statistics that i would like to have facts for . 
  are there any gallup or similar polls taken of asylum applicants that may help ? 
  this is a legitimate concern . 
  i am looking at this from link in op :  across the eu-28 , the gender distribution was most balanced for asylum applicants aged less than 14 , where boys accounted for 53 % of the total number of applications in 2014 . 
  the inference i am seeing is that father and son/daughter come seeking asylum , however something happened to the mother as :  there was a greater degree of gender inequality for asylum applicants aged 14 -- 17 or 18 -- 34 , where around three quarters of applicants were male . 
  the image i am seeing is that dad , son , daughter , and grandmother ( of elderly there are more females ) seek asylum . 
  but something happened to mom . 
  have all these mothers been forced into prostitution ? 
  the only problem i see is that [ the vast majority ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:countries_of_origin_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_seekers_in_the_eu-28_member_states,_2013_and_2014_yb15_iii.png ) of refugees come from war-torn countries . 
  20 % of all refugees came from syria , 7 % from afghanistan , 6 % from kosovo , and so on and so on . 
  what i 'd like to know is why out of all those people , 75 % are men . 
  are the women and children left behind in the midst of war ? 
  are the women and children captured ? 
  are the men mostly soldiers fleeing from war ? 
  what is the reason that the entire family did n't move ? 
  i also thought of perhaps the men are sent first in the hopes of them getting money together to bring the rest of the family later . 
  would this mean that europe could expect a tremendous increase in asylum seeking women and children in the coming years ? 
  or are the men planning on moving back to their war-torn countries ? 
  i would love some facts to go along with any theory , otherwise we 're all basically just guessing . 
  whoops , did not see . 
  i 'm as left ( us left . 
  i am liberal . 
  i also [ understand where the immigrants are from ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/35ki3d/eu_refugee_quotas_to_be_proposed/cr5qur8?context=10000 ) ) as they come . 
  was debating my more concerned cousin who brought this up , then i found that statistic . 
  figured i 'd post to / r/asksocialscience , and xpost here . 
  edit : i 'm hoping this thread can be used to actually provide answers on what is going on . 
  statistics do n't lie , no matter what the downvoters say . 
  ... oh i always took it to mean this day was more unique than the past , and it 's how the future will look like . 
  english is my second language though . 
  what is this a picture of ? 
  is this the us equivalent of kkk ? 
  that 's my point . 
  people are not coming to the eu just for the sake of coming to the eu . 
  they are coming from high risk areas , fleeing either war , threat of war , or economic/political crisis . 
  and by far the greatest number of people are coming from war-torn countries . 
  like syria . 
  i posted this to another commenter in a different thread : you would have a point , if the majority of the refugees came from morrocco . 
  [ unfortunately the situation is not that simple ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics ) . 
  625 920 refugees came in 2014 , that is a 45 % increase over the previous year . 
  [ in 2014 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/d5/countries_of_origin_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_seekers_in_the_eu-28_member_states%2c_2013_and_2014_yb15_iii.png ) : * 20 % were from syria ( more than double over the previous year ) * 7 % were from afghanistan * 6 % were from kosovo * 6 % were from eritrea ( more than double over the previous year ) * 5 % were from serbia * 5 % were from pakistan * 3 % were from iraq ( double over the previous year ) * 3 % were from nigeria ( almost double over the previous year ) * 3 % were from russia ( half of previous year ) * 3 % were from albania * 3 % were from somalia * 2.5 % were stateless ( almost double over the previous year ) * 25 % came from ukraine , mali , bangladesh , gambia , iran , bosnia , macedonia , unknown , georgia , congo , algeria , senegal , guinea , sudan , armenia , sri lanka , china , and turkey * 11 % came from ` other ' to sum up : 69 % came from ` controversial ' countries , 20 % from syria , 11 % from ` other ' . 
  but morrocco is n't even the main source of transit though . 
  [ the graph ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/80260000/gif/_80260634_migrant_numbers_20150102_624-01.gif ) is from the [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24583286 ) , it clearly shows that the vast majority of transit came through the central mediterranean . 
  the western mediterranean , [ where morrocco is ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/morocco/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0xd0b88619651c58d:0xd9d39381c42cffc3?sa=x&amp;ei=c_rqvazwe8mfgwt41ybi&amp;ved=0ci0bepibmbe ) , does n't even make up 1/8 of the people traveling . 
  as a [ sidenote ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:final_decisions_on_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applications,_2014_%28number,_rounded_figures%29_yb15_iii.png ) , of the 600 000 asylum decisions that eu countries had to make only 123 000 were actually made . 
  of the 123 000 decisions , 108 000 rejected the application .
