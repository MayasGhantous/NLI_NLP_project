  [ here it is in graphical form ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:first_instance_decisions_in_the_eu-28_by_outcome,_selected_citizenships,_4th_quarter_2014.png ) edit : found 2014-15 graph . 
  you would have a point , if the majority of the refugees came from morrocco . 
  [ unfortunately the situation is not that simple ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/asylum_statistics ) . 
  625 920 refugees came in 2014 , that is a 45 % increase over the previous year . 
  [ in 2014 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/d5/countries_of_origin_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_seekers_in_the_eu-28_member_states%2c_2013_and_2014_yb15_iii.png ) : * 20 % were from syria ( more than double over the previous year ) * 7 % were from afghanistan * 6 % were from kosovo * 6 % were from eritrea ( more than double over the previous year ) * 5 % were from serbia * 5 % were from pakistan * 3 % were from iraq ( double over the previous year ) * 3 % were from nigeria ( almost double over the previous year ) * 3 % were from russia ( half of previous year ) * 3 % were from albania * 3 % were from somalia * 2.5 % were stateless ( almost double over the previous year ) * 25 % came from ukraine , mali , bangladesh , gambia , iran , bosnia , macedonia , unknown , georgia , congo , algeria , senegal , guinea , sudan , armenia , sri lanka , china , and turkey * 11 % came from ` other ' to sum up : 69 % came from ` controversial ' countries , 20 % from syria , 11 % from ` other ' . 
  these are not folk trying to go from middle class to high class . 
  to be fair , the thousands of refugees are not coming from france . 
  there is an ethical and moral responsibility . 
  the way there would be if thousands of refugees fled from europe to russia , middle east , or north africa . 
  some are also drawing parallels to 1930 's , when jews were asking for asylum and were n't given it . 
  look how that turned out . 
   i would rather my country crumble into dust than become `` vibrant '' yeesh . 
  i was nodding along all the way down this thread , then i read this . 
   it can only take one decision to make a complete turn around and be a jihadists is there trigger that you think is more common than others ? 
  i mean can we blame them ? 
  most immigrants go to western country for a better life . 
  my parents and us ( children ) moved to us from hungary for the same reason , people from a wartorn country see things more desperately . 
  if the situation was reversed and europe was being categorically destroyed by terrorism , poverty , corruption , you can bet people will flee to the middle east , russia , and north africa . 
   enforce current border laws . 
   stay in your camps . 
  apply for asylum there i thought current laws require asylum seekers to apply for asylum in the country they are applying for ? 
  1000 euros = 12,000 per year . 
  poverty line in belgium is 9,300 . 
  plenty of motivation to get a job when you 're teetering on poverty 's front door . 
  edit : for future information on belgium :  those living in refugee reception centres receive a weekly spending allowance of 7.40 euros per adult . 
  some can also carry out paid work at the centre , receiving up to 185 euros per month . 
  after six months , people can apply for a work permit . 
   work permit issued once asylum application is approved ; immediate family members can then also come to belgium . 
  being beheaded in that region is not limited to christians ... 
  gypsies ? 
  well , iran and pakistan are at any rate . 
  uae not so much . 
  i see , thanks . 
  i 'm obviously lacking in basic cognitive faculties . 
  why does it follow that because they think it 's racist to build the wall they should move to mexico instead of canada ? 
  yep . 
  just pointing out trump wants mexico to pay for the wall , which is just not going to happen . 
  i do n't think comparing the hungarian wall to a possible us wall ( `` 50ft tall '' ) is fair . 
  first , trump says us wo n't pay for it . 
  second , the us wall is going to be much longer and , allegedly , much taller . 
  finally , the us wall is much more expensive ( at least , last i heard it was estimated to be 30 billion dollars , not including things like building roads to the site , getting permission from land owners , etc. ), 
  i 'm pretty sure people bring it up because of facts . 
  right now more mexicans go back to mexico than come here , so there 's no need for a while . 
  in addition , 50 % of undocumented residents came here legally then overstayed instead of going back . 
  again , no reason for a wall . 
  also , trumps statement . 
  mexico sends over its rapists , murderers , something something and some of them are good people . 
  something not paid for by syrians , but by hungary . 
  this is in direct opposition to trump 's plan . 
   when they should be going to mexico . 
  wait , why ? 
  i do n't follow . 
   how about you start electing people who want change like obama ? 
  not that it changed much . . 
  maybe it started out that way but then he got used to it ? 
  if he is talking like that as a strategy , you would think he would modify is talk based on audiences . 
  talk one way with vets , another way with leaders , another way with scientists , another way at rallies and media events , etc. 
  but he seems to be using the same method at all times . 
  what do you mean it does n't matter ? 
  in a nation of 300 million , 63 million voted trump and 68 million voted clinton , with a 60 percent turnout . 
  you ca n't say trump is a representative of the us when half the country disagrees with him and 40 % did n't vote . 
  just to clarify . 
  people call it a muslim ban become trump [ wanted ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration/index.html ) a muslim ban . 
  actually , [ this article ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/is-president-trumps-immigration-order-a-muslim-ban/514989/ ) summarizes pretty nicely the reasons why people call it a muslim ban . 
  and , of course , the courts [ seem to agree ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-court-iduskbn18l2io ) so far . 
   us appeal court 's chief judge states revised ban ` drips with religious intolerance , animus , and discrimination ' . 
  so , hungary is ... a rock ? 
  i always thought it looked like a ship or something . 
  and there goes my innocence . 
  july 18th is a bit early for our date , we are leaving september and coming home in december . 
  for sim cards we need to get new phones . 
  not a big deal , there are many cheap phones available for use with a sim card . 
  thanks for that link , the castles and especially the transfagarasan road looks intriguing !, 
  these routes look fantastic , exactly what we were looking for . 
  germany is definitely on our `` countries to go to '' list , so i will have to take up on your offer as we narrow down our choices some more . 
  right now we are taking everything that everyone suggested , looking it over , and seeing what we can add in . 
  i am not familiar with london ( any part of it ) , is there any place in particular that would be cool to explore ? 
  ~ ~ i am not familiar with london ( any part of it ) , is there any place in particular that would be cool to explore ? ~ ~ edit : wrong reply button . 
  funny you should mention . 
  my primary destination besides family in hungary is [ taize ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taiz%c3%a9_community ) , france . 
  any specific place in france you would recommend ? 
  we actually looked at both eurail and interrail . 
  one of the requirements for interrail is to have lived in a country in europe for `` for at least the past 6 months '' and have a european passport . 
  so we are left with eurorail , which although is more expensive ( 566usd v. 800usd ) does allow for more than one month of continuous use . 
  do you have a link to one of the rail guides ? 
  just somewhere i can start looking ? 
  based off of the previous comment , i feel like i 'm missing a reference to something . 
  but i am googling your suggestions nevertheless . 
  thanks !, 
  yes , that is basically our intention . 
  besides visiting family , we thought we would take this opportunity to get to know at least some of the countries and cultures that we can . 
  is there a specific significance of that soviet uranium mine ? 
  it does look fun to climb through , but not sure what we should expect . 
  this is fantastic , will definitely looking into it . 
  hi reddit , so this is my first time posting in this subreddit , and i apologize if it is mainly for european politics and news . 
  let me know if there is a better subreddit to post this to . 
  my brother and i are going on a 3 month trip to europe next semester . 
  we are first generation hungarians who moved to the us at ages 7 and 9 , and we are fluent in english and hungarian . 
  we can get by on german after we brush up a little bit . 
  the goal is to see not just the major sights like the eiffel tower , berlin wall , vatican , etc , but also any relatively quiet places as well .
