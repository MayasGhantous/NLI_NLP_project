  what you wanted to ask is the difference between * lager * and * ale * which is the temperature of fermentation ( lager : ~ 10 \u00b0 c , ale : 15-20 \u00b0 c ) and hence the position of the yeast during fermentation bottom / top of the liquid , respectively . 
   i think everyone and their brother had control over belgrade at one point in time . 
  little wonder that everyone wanted , amazing location , good food and paaaarteey . 
  - noisy neighbours . 
  - best hamburger in the world . 
  - we used to own vojvodina and belgrade for some time . 
  the bells ring at noon to commemorate the siege of belgrade in 1456 , where john hunyadi defeated the ottomans . 
  - in the 12th century , we had a serbian queen , * helena of rascia * , who was actually governing the country in place of her husband , the blind king . 
  she was a successful leader . 
  apart from that , she probably was n't faint-hearted : organised the massacre of 68 lords , who suggested a previous king to blind her husband as a child . 
  ( * red weddding style massacre * ) - i still remember the b52 bombers flying over hungary to bomb serbia in 1999 . 
  - black cat , white cat . 
  `` before noon '' ) about 09:30 -12:00 afternoon ( * d\u00e9lut\u00e1n * ) ~ 12:00 -05:00 evening ( * este * ) ~ 05:00 -10:00 night ( * \u00e9jszaka / \u00e9jjel * ) ~ 10:00 -04:00, 
  deflation ? 
  the ksh webpage tells me that in may the inflation was 1.8 % and the national bank 's recent projection for 2013 is 3.8 % . 
  to be honest i have n't noticed the drop in the beer price , but that does n't mean anything . 
  apart from nominally reducing the inflation , how does the 10 % cut of the utility bills affect the economy ? 
  considering the increasing taxes , to me it does n't seem to have an overall positive effect , i.e. 
  people wo n't / ca n't spend more money . 
  but i 'm no economist so please do enlighten me . 
  i have no stocks in the affected companies , but i do have a friend working at a telecom company and according to her the situation is n't too rosy . 
  and no politician seems to care how the employees are treated at a multinational company . 
   would you rather have tax increases or huge cuts to public services ? 
  personally , yes , in certain areas . 
  i believe huge amounts of money are wasted due to structural issues , organization and management problems and corruption of course . 
  lots of that money could be spared and spent where it 's needed . 
  one example : the health care is in pretty bad shape , the hospitals have huge debts . 
  a friend of mine used to live in a dormitory for doctors and nurses , owned and run by the local hospital . 
  i visited her a few times . 
  once i noticed that one of the male toilets was broken , you could n't stop it flushing , the water was constantly flowing down . 
  half a year later , when my friend moved out , it was in the same condition . 
  no one cared , after all the water bill was paid by the state . 
  stupid communist mindset . 
  people seem to forget that it 's taxpayers ' money . 
  i know that bank-bashing is really popular on reddit , but afaik we did n't need to pay them huge bailouts during the crisis . 
  and now our beloved government introduces one special tax on the financial industry after the other . 
  the unpredictable financial environment scares off the investors , capital is fleeing the country . 
  apart from the dismal economic effects , eventually the ordinary citizens will foot the bill , e.g. 
  in the form of increased banking costs . 
  as side effect , we are in the state of constant warfare with the eu as the legal background of these taxation laws is rather dubious . 
  and there were cuts in public services too , in the most stupid ways . 
  ( e.g. 
  higher education . ), 
  meanwhile , the government is buying votes : they 've set a ceiling for the profit of ( mostly german ) companies providing electricity , gas , etc. , reducing the household bills by 10 % . 
  this was the * ` we cut the bills ' * campaign , with the foreign companies designated as the evil . 
  they had this petition to support the measure in case there was an international scandal . 
  like 1.5 million people signed it , even though its effect is effectively cancelled out by the increasing taxes . 
  the left wing opposition 's answer : `` you should 've cut the bills by 30 % '' so i have doubts whether severe cuts alone could boost economic growth , but overtaxation certainly can not . 
   we could sort of compare him and his companions with talibans . 
  i had the jewish terrorists who fought against the british imperial forces in mind . 
  or the ira . 
   `` let 's unite all slavs but make our capital the centre of power . '', 
  i guess we planned something similar with the danubian federation . 
  hungary : - another set of austerity measures including : - - almost doubling the tax of financial transactions - 6 % `` health care '' tax on interest incomes - increasing the telecommunication tax of companies - this year banks have to give the sate some extra money for some made-up reason - increasing mining taxes - festival season starting - usual summer weather ( = heat + storms ) - european committee does n't like us again because of strict restrictions on getting loans in a foreign currency . 
  ( restrictions were introduced after lots of people got loans in swiss franc before the crisis , and they struggled to pay them back . ), 
  - hungarian blokes running a successful dating site in ny - the court rejected to register the hungarian double-tailed dog party as a real party . 
  it 's a joke party that has been trolling around for a few years , e.g. 
  promising * free beer , eternal life , and smaller hungary * at the elections . 
  i 'd certainly vote for them . 
  - the country 's most honest politician , jozsef angyan has quit the ruling party . 
  earlier he promised that he will quit if they accept the new law about farming lands which favours large farms and wealthy farm owners over smallholders . 
  - it seems the legal battle between builder company and city council is over and the [ glass whale ] ( http://m.cdn.blog.hu/ce/cet/image/cet.jpg ) will open in october . 
  - that awkward [ hipster ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roimfhq76xk ) we sent to the eurovision got a state award . 
  - this [ animal ] ( http://kep.index.hu/1/0/445/4450/44503/4450382_ce7d13b092ba4041023df289d77f60fc_wm.jpg ) is the new favourite in budapest,

  i 'm curious , is gavrilo princip considered some sort of a national hero ? 
  do bosnians see the assassination justifiable ? 
  i mean the archduke was n't exactly a tyrant or dictator . 
  i totally get the whole national independence thing - we fought an independence war against the austrians about 65 yrs before the assassination - but to me those guys seem to be terrorists . 
  this is kinda awkward :  after \u010cabrinovi\u0107 's bomb missed the archduke 's car , four other conspirators , including princip , lost an opportunity to attack because of the heavy crowds and the high speed of the archduke 's car . 
  to avoid capture , \u010cabrinovi\u0107 swallowed a cyanide capsule and jumped into the river miljacka to make sure he died . 
  the cyanide pill was expired and made him sick , but failed to kill him and the river miljacka was only 10 centimetres ( 4 in ) deep . 
  a few seconds later he was hauled out and detained by police . 
  in austria and hungary as well .

  [ this one . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi_ngsgg1fa ), 
  i 'm not sure how widespread these are but sometimes i heard people mockingly calling the hungarian forint ** ` true hungarian forint ' ** ( * igaz magyar forint * ) or ** good hungarian forint ** ( * j\u00f3 magyar forint * ) , the first one pokes fun at right wing 's nationalist manner of speaking , the second was originally a real expression when the golden forint of the medieval kingdom of hungary was considered a hard currency , contrary to the present situation . 
  quite often it 's called simply ** huf ** , which is also its abbreviation . 
  three points were criticised by the ec : - there was a point in the new constitution , that allowed the government to introduce special taxes if a court such as the european court of justice charges the country to pay some kind of fine and there 's no enough money in the budget * and * the national debt is higher than half of the gdp . 
  obviously they were preparing for ufavourable decisions form the european court . 
  now they remove this from the constitution and put it into a regular law concerning ` economic stability ' or something . 
  - the constitution also allowed the president of ` national office of courts ' , ( loosely translated ) i.e. 
  the person who oversees the courts , to transfer any case from one court to another one . 
  they claimed this was necessary as some courts were overloaded and some cases took ages to arrive at a sentence . 
  this is an existing problem , nevertheless , they were accused with trying to manipulate the decision as the president of the aforementioned comittee is elected by the parliament and he/she could transfer cases to judges who can be expected to give a favourable sentence . 
  they agreed to remove this from the constitution to ` prevent derogatory accusations of the judicature ' . 
  - the third criticised point , which the government rejected , was the ban of paid political advertisements during election campaigns . 
  parties can only advertise in the public media , without paying for it . 
  which would be nice if the public media was indepentent and unbiased . 
  the ec wanted them to not apply this on the ep elections , but the government insisted . 
  - record high flood on the danube . 
  the river will reach its highest level at budapest tonight , for the greatest joy of tourists . 
  fortunately we had time to prepare and prevent major disaster . 
  all politicians are on the dams filling sandbags , to show who 's the coolest guy in the land .
