  you should totally launch a business under the name * `` national period costume hire '' be the star of the national dancefloor ! * . 
   you 'd need to pay a percentage of the revenues to some politicians though . 
  you know , we do n't have immigrants , so we need to entertain ourselves . 
  i doubt that would happen , actually they 're mushrooming in the old jewish district . 
  the adverse reaction of the residents is quite natural . 
  the solution of course not closing the pubs , but there 're issues that should be addressed and of course our beloved leaders fail to do so . 
  i think gerusz was referring to the pm 's infamous sentence . 
  once he was defending the changes in higher education , saying that the old system flooded the job market with people holding degrees that are wothless and we could ` dam the danube ' with jobless college-educated people brooding all day in half-lit ruin pubs . 
  this sentence then went viral . 
  edit : the widely used expression `` one could dam the danube with something '' means that there 's really a lot of something, 
  actually it * could * be a good idea , but there are two problems : 1 ) the approach is incredibly lame , our government believes it 's still the late 19th - early 20th century ( you can see this view surfacing in many things education included ) and thinks that young adults who grew up on nirvana will find the love of their lives on balls while dancing waltzer . 
  2 ) they chose the wrong target group . 
  as gerusz said , university students can find partners rather easily . 
  there 's a group what actually finds diffcult to socialize and meet new people : young adults in their mid/late 20s and early 30s , who just got off the university , work hard and have limited free time , most of their friends are married / in a long relationship . 
  especially if they live in a smaller city , where the nightlife sucks . 
  that 's a real problem and the moron politicians of course entirely miss the point . 
  also : - two climbers died in the himalaya after climbing the kanchenjunga ( world 's 3rd highest peak ) . 
  they got exhausted and did n't make it back to the camp . 
  one of them was a kind of celebrity climber who climbed 9 peaks over 8000m and lost one leg a few years ago . 
  - public outrage because the commissioner responsible for culture happened to say in a meeting that `` the new national theatre will be just as successful as before , but the central topic wo n't be the ** faggots ** anymore . '', 
  ( loosely translated ) . 
  the current director of the national theatre , whose mandate ends next month , often accused by using unjustifiable amount of sexuality on the stage . 
  ( also i heard often that he 's gay but i do n't know/care . ), 
  apparently the new director will focus on the ` national ' drama , whatever that is . 
  - super cute [ lion cubs ] ( http://galeria.index.hu/belfold/2013/05/24/ujabb_harom_kisoroszlan_szuletett/ ) have been born - the aforemenioned ** national matchmaker dance night ** series ( sponsored by the * taxpayers * ) did n't have a warm welcome : the official facebook page needed to be shut down after 2 days because of trolling . 
  ( * will we have a chance to dance pogo ? / does the government provide free condoms ? / who 's the responsible if i got some nasty std ? / if i can not find a partner after 3-5 nights , will the treasury allocate one for me ? 
  * ) - aftermath of the * ` national tobacco shop ' scandal * ( previously the government changed the laws of selling tobacco products , anyone who wanted to sell them had to apply for concession . 
  after many shop keepers lost their right to sell tobacco , it turned out that allegedly the applications were considered and the decisions were made by the local leaders of the ruling party who were biased quite a bit . ), 
  - [ row with germany ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2013/05/21/germany-and-hungary-at-odds-over-orban-tanks-comment/ ) ( again ) , our pm behaved like the elephant in the china shop ( again ), 
  georgia has a tradition of violent protests ending in street fights between various political groups . 
  the evolution of democracy . 
  as the article says :  although surveys show homophobic attitudes run deep in the georgia , wisg director ekaterine aghdgomelashvili say the counter-protest would have never reached its scale and intensity without the church 's mobilization efforts . 
  its action was more a power play than a protest against policy , she says . 
   * `` this was not a demonstration against lgbt people , '' * she said . 
  * `` this was the georgian orthodox church showing its power to the new government . 
  we were just the pretext . '' *, 
   if this had happened in baku that actually might have been a leap forward compared to the current lgbt rights situation . 
  such a pity that our only close relatives are being wiped out by the russians ... 
  to be exact , fermi 's question is the [ famous fermi paradox . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fermi_paradox ) he assumed that given the vast number of stars , ets must exist , so where are they ? 
  ( `` where is everybody ? '' ), 
  his colleague , le\u00f3 szil\u00e1rd gave the quoted answer .

  [ i did in another comment . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1eydg5/armenia_and_europe/ca53ol2 ), 
  i 'll try but , it 's a bit hard to describe an impression that 's a result of all the little things around you . 
  i believe the bottom line is that in turkey i felt i 'm a stranger whereas in georgia - in any corner of the country - i felt like home , despite of the completely different alphabet which took a while to learn . 
  i guess the devil is the details : beer / wine price - much lower in georgia , where beer and wine are as common drinks as anywhere in europe , on contrary to turkey flags - in turkey , you see lots of huge turkish flags . 
  kinda feels nationalist . 
  you are remembered that this country is big and powerful . 
  in georgia , you see eu flags everywhere . 
  they know that they 're part of europe and want to show it . 
  if you ask the people what they think , vast majority will say the belong to europe . 
  secularity - in turkey obviously you can not escape the feeling that you 're in a country where islam dominates . 
  especially in the east , the dress code for women and the rules of public behaviour are strict . 
  i was shouted at because i kissed my girlfriend on the forehead . 
  georgia is a very religious orthodox country and you see tons of old churches , ( which is also a familiar sight for most europeans ) , the impact of religion on life is nowhere near to turkey . 
  food  people - turkish often treat you as a stranger , as a tourist . 
  caucasians treat you as a fellow european . 
  i might be somewhat biased because even though turkish generally consider hungarians ` brothers ' , they tried to milk me a few times , assuming i 'm a wealthy westerner . 
  of course the list is incomprehensive , there are a large number of differences between the lifestyle of turkey and georgia or armenia , both rural and urban areas . 
  edit : one more very non-european thing about turkey : pictures of ataturk ** everywhere ** . 
  allow me please to disagree . 
  i can not speak for armenia directly but i experienced a striking cultural difference crossing the border between turkey and georgia near posof in the lesser caucasus . 
  ( the difference is less obvious along the black sea coast because everything there is centered around the tourism regardless of being turkish or georgian ... )  culturally armenia is closer to iran and turkey rather than europe . 
  well , turkey is n't that far from europe either . 
  iran is another thing . 
  i 've never met armenians or been to armenia , but i knew someone with armenian grandparents . 
  she was fiercely proud of her heritage . 
  ( also smoking hot . 
   ) also , i 've been to the neighbouring georgian province ( samtskhe-javakheti ) where many armenians live and also to your ancient royal city , kars ( now in turkey ) where i visited the holy apostles church . 
  ( unfortunately i did n't have time to see the ruins of ani . ), 
  so yes , i think both armenia and georgia are part of europe because of the common cultural roots . 
  armenian diaspora frequently compared to jewish communities , in both good and bad way . 
  i guess most people heard about the genocide and that you mutually hate each other with the turks and are in a frozen war with azerbaijan over some rocks . 
  for an average european your affection to russia might seem a bit suspicious  as a hungarian i 'm really sorry about the recent diplomatic row following the extradition of safarov . 
  our government made a stupid decision but politics is always a dirty game , especially when oil/gas is involved . 
  in the 17th century about 600 armenian families , who fled ani , immigrated to transylvania ( that time under hungarian rule ) where they were welcomed and the prince gave them special rights . 
  among other things , they 've brought their national dishes and contributed to the transylvanian cousine quite a bit . 
  come on , everyone knows that hungary is a [ wienerschnitzel ( r\u00e1ntotth\u00fas ) .

  holy shit ... 
  i 've had doubts by the credibility of aljazeera before , but this ... no comment . 
  so we have the courage to lie the biggest . 
  it 's one of the major news portals . 
  far from the guardian or spiegel but not very shitty ... actually kinda funny . 
  also liberal i.e. 
  slightly biased against right wing . 
  what 's the croatian index like ? 
  thanks , your fellow countryman has already pointed it out , but i was just quoting graham norton . 
  absolutely . 
  that 's actually a good song . 
  i guess the blame is on the drawing , the first song never wins . 
  and the forest fairy triumphed ... 
  a few 10 ^ 4 hungarians who 've emigrated to germany in recent years , 
  seeing so many countries giving high points to azerbaijan , i 'm wondering : are we the only ones wanting them to buy our treasury bonds ? 
  the land of ding-dong !, 
  :d thank you . 
  what the hell austria ? 
  i assure you our conservative-christian government is n't jumping with joy either ,
