  did you miss the eurovision last year in baku ? 
  we should 've sent the punk band * hat\u00f3s\u00e1gilag tilos ( ~ forbidden by the authorities ) * with the song [ kapuv\u00e1ri buzib\u00e1r / the gay bar in kapuvar ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ma-bekxc38 ) the non-pc lyrics is roughly : * tonight i 'm going down to kapuv\u00e1r and have a good dance with some faggots * * i 'm gay , i 'm a faggot * * i 'll jump on the gay-train , then the gay-rickshaw * * i 'm gay , i 'm a faggot * * this is the gay bar of kapuv\u00e1r * * sha-la-la-la-lal-la * * i 'm gay * * sha-la-la-la-lal-la * * i 'm a faggot * and so on ... 
  this year i do n't know but from previous years i recall something like that . 
  also i had the impression that they genuinely believe this is art , each year trying to send some artist-like performer , play their song in national radio ten times a day and then get very surprised and sad when we get low points and start analyse why no one votes for us because of historical and cultural reasons ... 
  what is this belorussian cha-cha-cha anyway ? 
  i think they tend to take the whole eurovision waaayy too seriously . 
  the bbc coverage is absolutely hilarious .

  i thought it 's the point to send complete fools to the contest . 
   like lordi . 
  for that reason , i 'd say romania for the win !, 
  i truly hope that our boring hipster wo n't make it to the final . 
  edit : shit . 
  i would n't say it 's annoying , it 's not necessarily a bad thing to being forced to learn languages . 
  although it 's a little bit inconvenient that our [ closest relatives ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khant_peoples ) , whose language would be the easiest to learn , live pretty far away , in siberia . 
  ( well , at least until the russians wipe out their culture completey . ), 
  certainly not hungarian  i 'd say spanish is easy and versatile , although not especially useful within europe . 
  if that matters , french or german . 
  really , it depends on which part of the world you want to live/work . 
  russian is really handy in eastern europe and central asia and not particularly useful anywhere else . 
  i 'd think german , french and russian are equally hard , maybe russian is harder for you as english has more in common with the former two . 
  700k seems quite a lot ... 
  i know it rather depends on how you define it , but according to [ this study ] ( http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0cdyqfjaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ksh.hu%2fdocs%2fhun%2fxftp%2fidoszaki%2fmezo%2fmezo11.pdf&amp;ei=2kwfuajmk4gc0qxflygwcw&amp;usg=afqjcnf_p7h9panfpqpmluijvlq7pgex4w&amp;sig2=stp7slvjsib0xdwu7r6-oq&amp;bvm=bv.45960087,d.d2k ) from the central statistical office , in 2011 , 185k people were employed in agriculture , forestry and fishery , out of 3.8 million employed . 
  obviously the real figure is somewhat higher . 
  also the study says there were 433k ` companies ' in the agricultural sector . 
  [ this presentation ] ( http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0cemqfjad&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.3kconsens.hu%2ffiles%2f2.%2520eloadas%25202.%2520gazdasagi%2520folyamatok%2520%28treninganyag%29.ppt%3fphpsessid%3d17b3ce907f05f03957c125c33e557259&amp;ei=2kwfuajmk4gc0qxflygwcw&amp;usg=afqjcngg2a2m_f11ax4mkkqf3paukqmedq&amp;sig2=qjcgumh6sfot6jdxk22nqa&amp;bvm=bv.45960087,d.d2k ) has interesting data too . 
  anyway , i 'm not sure this regulation would do much good to the country . 
  firstly , even if you force someone to stay 100 days a year in the country , it would not ensure that they pay their taxes here , use hungarian workforce or spend/invest their income here . 
  on the other hand if a foreigner would meet those requirements i really would n't care where they 've come from . 
  but i doubt such requirements would agree with eu law . 
  in my opinion the big problem of the agricultural sector are the stupid structure , the lack of knowledge and that shitload of stupid bureaucracy , not the foreign farmers . 
  we 'd need something like the french or the italians have and produce more high quality handcrafted stuff instead of competing against cheap south american etc. 
  mass products . 
  in terms of employment , most people working in the agricultural sector are uneducated and their tipical wages are low . 
  and i really do n't like that the government seems to think that the country 's future lies in hands of semiskilled workers . 
  as someone who 's grown up in the village and knows ho to handle a hoe , i believe the agriculture is very important and has issues that needs to be dealt with , but i believe `` a nation 's strength lies in the multitude of educated heads '' as count sz\u00e9chenyi said . 
  also , there 's another consequence of this ban : the farmland prices are low because the demand is artificially restricted . 
  if foreigners were allowed to buy , the prices would go up . 
  unfortunately i 'm facing the possibility of inheriting some farmland in the coming years , while my profession ties me to big cities . 
  i do n't intend to sell it , but if i wanted , of course i 'd prefer to sell it for a higher price . 
   hungary is an `` agricultural country '' in the sense , that even the world finance crash could not hurt it , it could , very much . 
  if the long-awaited eurogeddon came , whole industries collapsed and lots of people did ' t have money to pay for food and the energy and fuel prices skyrocketed , hungarians , farmers included would suffer like the rest regardless of the large agricultural sector . 
  but the climate change is a much worrying prospect . 
   a large part of hungarian society depends on it for living . 
  are you sure about this ? 
  i would n't think that many people do it for a living , although i admit i have n't seen the official statistics . 
  last year the agriculture produced only * 3.1 % * of the gdp , in 2011 , it was 4.6 % with record high income . 
  i know lots of people keep a few animals or grow some veg for a little extra income , but i 'm not sure whether there are many professional farmers . 
  the way i see it , for various reasons it 's hard to earn a living with farming and many people would sell their farmland to wealthy foreigners what the government is trying to prevent . 
  as i recall , similar thing happened in the early 90s when the lands previously taken by the commies were given back to the owners ( k\u00e1rp\u00f3tl\u00e1s ) but many of them did n't know what to do with the lands and sold them instantly well below the real value . 
  i ca n't really understand why our government is making this fuzz about the agriculture . 
  i recall mr orban explicitly saying that the agriculture is `` in our genes '' and hungary is `` fundamentally an agricultural country '' . 
  i 'm not sure he was aware of the gdp data ... which is quite disturbing . 
  let 's say we plough up all the national parks and double the output of agriculture ... it would be still nowhere near to the service sector . 
  ( note : my family is farming too . ), 
  you 're right , i got confused a little , my original comment i quoted from was n't related to horthy . 
  so , * nominally * horthy was in power when the mass deportations began in march 1944 but the germans already occupied the country and put the real power in the hands of the arrow cross party ( which was banned before that ) . 
  the kidnapping of horthy 's son and his detention happened in october 44 after he announced the withdrawal from the axis and quiting the war . 
   your summary makes it sound like only a few tens of thousands of jews perished until horthy was deposed and made way to the arrow cross . 
  practically that 's what i meant . 
  not really * nationalistic * . 
  it 's a * protectionist * measure . 
  obviously not very nice doing this in the eu but most countries play such cards sometimes . 
  uk is looking to limit the number immigrants from eastern europe . 
  the basis of this ban is that for some reason the some politicians in the government - and the pm himself - think that the agriculture could be an important source of economic growth . 
  this is quite odd way of thinking in the 21st century though . 
  they say hungarian farmland is really cheap compared to other european countries and they fear that wealthy foreigners buy up large farmlands and channel their income out of the country . 
  of course you can argue whether this is right or not . 
  but it has not much to do with nationalism . 
  for different reasons though . 
  i believe there are/were restrictions of buying agricultural land in france , denmark as well . 
  nevertheless , you can buy anything in hungary , you only need to find the right place/person  there are large farmlands that are nominally owned buy some hungarian company but the real owner is foreigner . 
   there are just limits on buying farm land and such . 
  actually it 's not a limit , it 's a moratorium . 
  and this is not unique to hungary . 
  a little historical background , quoted from an earlier comment of mine :  between 1939-41 about 18 000 jews were deported to the ukranian front line for forced labour . 
  ( the hungarian public was n't really informed about this . ), 
  most of them was killed by the ss , a few thousand fled back to hungary . 
   between 1942-44 , the new prime minister , michael k\u00e1llay , tried to resist the german pressure , rejected their demand to deport jews and even tried to bring home the already deported people , with little success . 
   finally the germans had enough and in march 1944 they occuppied hungary .
