  almost half million people were sent to auschwitz whithin few months . 
  the ruling arrow cross party never had a popular support in hungary and their government was the puppet of the germans . 
  that half million people was deported and butchered ** after ** the nazis removed horthy from power - the gestapo kidnapped his son wrapped in a carpet and blackmailed horthy to step down . 
  his older son ( both of them were very popular and * hated the nazis * ) died in a plane crash in 1942 , some say it was also the nazis ' work . 
  the horthy family was finally freed from captivity by us troops . 
  the horthy statues in hungary are not erected by the state , but some local politicians/groups . 
  they think that horthy was a strong leader , who did some nasty things only to choose the ` smaller evil ' , to protect the majority of people and because he had limited room for maneuvering . 
  in their eyes , if horthy had choosen the open confrontation with the reich , hungary would have shared the fate of poland , with much higher casualties . 
  ( knowing what happened after horthy was forced to step down , it 's probably true . ), 
  surrounded by hostile nations and being on the losing side in ww1 , nobody would 've shed a tear . 
  their opinion is that he was a smart politician who tried to mitigate the consequences of the rise of the nazi germany , made the country stronger and saved many lives - with some sacrifices . 
  personally i disagree , i believe he traded human rights for territorial gains and gambled taking serious risks . 
  and we paid for his mistakes with 4 decades of bloody commie dictatorship . 
  but i can understand those who think differently . 
  horthy himself stated that he never was antisemitic and did not know about what the nazis did with the jews in the concentration camps . 
  others saying it 's not true . 
  so that 's why he is controversial . 
  the schoolbooks differ from each other a bit , depending on the opinion of the authors , but every student learns about the white terror of horthy 's militias in the aftermath of ww1 and the jew laws and all that stuff . 
  i truly hope it 's not so . 
  another wonderful day to be hungarian on r/europe ... 
   horthy the guy responsible for those roma , jewish , slovakian , romanian deaths during the war you ca n't say that he 's the one person responsible , the history does n't work that way . 
  also you seem to think you 're wiser than the whole nurnberg comittee . 
  one thing is certain : no one is teaching you in hungarian schools that horthy was a good guy . 
  he 's remembered as a controversial figure . 
  he made a deal with the devil ( hitler ) by limiting the rights of jews in order to get our lost territories back and lead hungary into a war we could n't possibly win . 
  and he did n't do enough to stop the deportations and so on . 
  nevertheless after ww1 he consolidated the country and under his rule was hungary ` strong ' for the last time , that 's the only reason for the nostalgia . 
  with all the respect , the statement you made is a opinion and not a fact and it mirrors your * political views * . 
  moreover , you 're referring to an article published in a journal that never claimed to be unbiased . 
  if you present the ** bare statistical data ** , - which could be a true base of the discussion - obviously i wo n't talk about politics , but all other statements and conclusions * must * be considered with the context in mind . 
  i seriously doubt that . 
  are you familiar with the meaning of the words ` racist ' and ` independent & unbiased media ' ? 
  not necessarily ` fabricating ' data , but interpreting the staticstics in a misleading way and drawing peculiar conclusions . 
  such a bullshit ... always reminds me of tose old tobacco ads with doctors telling you that smoking is good for your teeth ... or when scientists believed that radioctive radiation is healthy and tooth paste with radium was sold . 
  i 'm curious where their funding has come from . 
  also it fascinates me how easily people can fail to see the bigger picture . 
  like , they say * the world is overpopulated * . 
  fuck , parts of it are overpopulated , and europe is not one of them . 
  here ** obesity ** is a much bigger health issue than famine and ` scientists say ' we need gmo to feed our pigs and cattle in order to keep the price of hamburger and pork chops down ... 
  it 's somewhat ironic that first we screw up the climate then engineer plants to cope with the screwed-up environment . 
  the solution for a famine-stricken african country is not gmo , it 's called stable democracy , modern farming methods and birth control . 
  africa could produce enough food for it 's population if it was n't a bloody mess . 
  of course that 's not such a good business as selling them gmo corn . 
  just to note , the really poor could never afford the gmo we could produce at european costs . 
  also , it is not the same process as conventional plant breeding . 
  here you transfer genes to a species from completely unrelated species . 
  not that i 'm against gmo in general , but it makes me crazy when people say , ` it 's necessary ' . 
  - potato  although i never get the polandball jokes , i would n't think latvia is a poor country - i read somewhere that language is really old , conserved some features that most indoeuropean languages have forgotten - you voted for austerity and your pm said it 's working and krugman can not admit he was mistaken - i heard from a friend that in the winter in the streets of riga there are large colourful lighting balloons or balls or chinese lanterns or whatever in order to cheer up people and mitigate the psychological consequences of low level of sunlight . 
  to sum up , latvia does n't seem a bad place . 
  apart from the weather of course :d edit : it was cool when latvian police stopped female drivers to give them roses on 8th of march, 
  oh lol our racist little friend has appeared .

  wow , this is pure and unadulterated bullshit . 
  this article is full with distorted facts and outright lies . 
  there are problems in hungary but orban is not worse than berlusconi , ask the german media . 
  and it 's still democracy and this government will loose the election either next year or 5 years later . 
  hungary can into cheap . 
  there 's one good thing about being the loser of the region and constantly struggling with crisis for several years : it ca n't be that much worse . 
  [ when you 're chewing on life 's gristle do n't grumble , give a whistle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlbilnn1nhq ), 
  since i 've seen [ heston blumenthal eating dormouse in slovenia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fe5fhanxng ) i 'd like to go over and try it . 
  true , although i thought that have n't really changed the structure or the composition of the language . 
  the reformers modernised the grammar and created new words and expressions using existing ones and mirror-translating foreign ones . 
  it 's kinda fascinating that they created new names from scratch and then they have become very popular , like * csilla , t\u00fcnde , dalma , gy\u00f6ngyv\u00e9r , t\u00edmea *, 
  short recipe for hungarian : - take a part finnish and and a part turkish or persian and gently simmer them for quite a while ( * uncertain origins ; possibly finno-ugric tribes interacting with turks * ) - add some slavic and continue simmering for 5 centuries , season with german and latin ( * hungarian invasion of the carpathian basin , assimilating sparse slavic population , interacting with slavic neighbours , german and latin influence * ) - discard [ old alphabet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:szekely_hungarian_rovas_alphabet_szekely_magyar_rovas_abc.svg ) - in the meantime add some more turk languages for the flavour ( * cuman and jassic people settling down in hungary * ) - add some more turkish and keep it in rapid boiling for 1.5 centuries ( * ottoman wars * ) - season with more german and let it simmer for about 4 centuries ( * part of the habsburg empire * ) - let it cool and be happy about how fucking complicated it is . 
  recently i have found that my language - despite being friggin complicated - can not cope with english :( i have problems to find the counterparts for english expressions and figures of speech . 
  the case of libya is quite interesting . 
  as you probably remember , the french managed to get the un mandate to intervene in the very last moment when the gaddafi forces were already in the outskirts of benghazi . 
  it would had been fucking awkward even for the russians to watch the city being massacred . 
  in that case it was quite clear who were that bad guys and who were the good guys . 
  of course there were some french and british interests at stake . 
  syria is much more complicated , it 's still a shame of the civilised world to let it happen . 
  i do n't think there 's a general recipe for managing such complex situations but human rights and democratic values are things that europeans should defend by all means . 
  of course i do n't expect everyone to share my opinion but my country is still suffering the legacy of four decades of commie dictatorship ; my grandfather 's family was deported in the 50s , himself spent years in prison while his brothers were executed for ` spying for the west ' . 
  dictatorship is not fun . 
  for comparison , after ww2 , allied powers tried and succeeded to turn germany into a democracy . 
  british soldiers are on german soil even today . 
  the us never wanted to turn afghanistan or iraq into a working , modern democracy , that would require decades of military presence and loads of money . 
  they just wanted to mitigate security risks posed by hussein and the taliban . 
  as i pointed out in my comment , i 'm perfectly aware that morality was n't the driving factor . 
  wars usually do n't have much to do with morality . 
  to answer your question , i do n't think we should tolerate mugabe , syria , north korea , somalia , congo , etc. 
  and if the eu held a referendum whether we should maintain a military presence in crippled african countries , i 'd vote with ` yes ' , moreover , i 'd volunteer to participate . 
  the funny thing is that germany probably would n't give a flying fuck - as they did during the scandalous reign of the previous hungarian ` socialist ' governments - if the beloved leaders of hungary were n't screwing the interests of german companies . 
  as i recall , they were also quite good at massive and indestructible washing machines and vacuum cleaners . 
  how about the [ 70s kabul ? 
  ] ( http://afghanistanonmymind.blogspot.co.uk/2011/06/afghanistan-in-60s-and-70s-with-or.html ), 
  i would say yes . 
  i believe it is morally justifiable to bring down any brutally oppressive dictatorship . 
  however , if you do that , then you become responsible for the fate of the country and its people . 
  imho it was justified to put an end to the terror of hussein and the taliban , but it was absolutely not justifiable to turn iraq/afghanistan into bloody mess and leave it there . 
  edit : of course we know that those countries - or mali for instance - were n't invaded because of the moral imperative . 
  fair enough , you do n't have to and it barely matters .
