  and it 's not a reason to downvote you . 
  there are loads of people in hungary who do n't share my dismal opinion about mr orban either . 
  i added that remark to the title because i do n't particularly like when politicians with , so to say , not a spotless carrier , pose as the guardians of democratic values . 
  especially do n't like when certain people regard their statements as they were the holy bible . 
  many belgians consider him an opportunist and turncoat , who started as a neoliberal ` baby tatcher ' and switched to the social-liberal side . 
  his presidency was n't a joyride , it was riddled with crises that gradually eroded his credibility , popularity and the support of his party . 
  finally he admitted defeat and started a new carrier in the ep . 
  mr orban is has been prime minister for 7 yrs altogether now and has a good chance to remain for another 4 yrs mainly due to the lack of alternatives . 
  however , that does n't make him a credible politician . 
  same goes for mr verhofstadt . 
  edit : so , the aim of my remark in the title was to make anyone reading this article keep in mind that it 's not the absolute truth , it 's the opinion of * just another politician . 
  * wow , just downvotes , no arguments . 
  i 've always admired the ` culture of debate ' on reddit . 
  that 's a problem with many prominent eu politicians . 
  of course not all of them , but many , including mr verhofstadt , either switched to european politics after they had become unpopular in their home country and their politics had failed or are ` exiled to brussels ' by their own party as they had become ` persona non grata ' for various reasons . 
  no , as i recall british authorities have recently held a press conference about the importance of protection against solar storm and the measures implemented in britain . 
  although they pointed out that other countries should take this issue way more seriously . 
  imagine what would happen if all the digital stuff , communication , gps , electricity grid threw in the towel simultaneously on large part of the globe . 
  as for estonia , the following chaos would provide a great opportunity for russia to march in ... just to help out with disaster management of course . 
  god save estonia from a carrington event . 
  `` we regret the lack of transparency and democratic accountability in any solution proposed by the commission , imf and the ecb for the eu . '' sincerely , european citizens, 
  1 , if you follow the news then you probably know that they picked this guy because they had no real candidate and someone recommended him . 
  and i guess you know how these things go in hungary ( and presumably in many other countries ) - people often got awards , contracts , etc. 
  not for the real merits but for being friends or relatives of decisionmakers . 
  2 , fidesz has jewish mps , also a roma representative in the ep . 
  recently in a debate in the parliament one of their mps , answering to a jobbik mp , declared that he is jewish . 
  so how are they racist and antisemitic ? 
  i partly agree with shenpen . 
  independent and guardian , even bbc has an unfortunate habit to form an opinion based on sketchy and/or biased information . 
  well , of course there 's some shit going on but sadly hungarians had time to get used to it , since it 's been going on since about 2001 under various governments . 
  the only thing that changes is the media coverage . 
  well , the majority of the people certainly does n't think [ the toxic mud spill at that alumina plant ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ajka_alumina_plant_accident ) happened because ** nato planes - participating in an international conspiracy against hungary - bombed the reservoir ** as this guy has explained in his tv show . 
  man , i laughed my ass off . 
  i 'm pretty sure he is actually a master troll , that 's the true reason of this award . 
  actually the committee found only one person worthy of the award , but they had 3 awards to give , so the minister asked the state secretary for culture to pick 2 other persons , one of them happened to be this idiot . 
   overall i believe the state can handle it better , under appropriate circumstances . 
  as always , the devil is in the details . 
  if the state means a bunch of douchebags , everything can go horribly wrong . 
  while i mostly agree with you on the issue of education , i believe there are things that state should keep a healthy distance from . 
  with all the respect , i disagree . 
  they did n't have 2/3 majority in the parliament so they could n't mess with the constitution etc. , but in my opinion they had no more respect for democratic institutions and principles than the current government whatsoever . 
  although i strongly dislike their attitude and politics for numerous reasons , i do n't think this administration is racist or antisemitic . 
  what would make you say that ? 
  behold the face of a true hypocrite . 
  mr schulz ( and the eu ) kindly looked the other way while his buddies in the previous socialist government screwed up hungary [ ` not a little but a lot ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferenc_gyurcs%c3%a1ny%27s_speech_in_balaton%c5%91sz%c3%b6d_in_may_2006 ) and were no less anti-democratic than the current leadership . 
  really nice to see how people try to organise themselves , help each other and manage the extreme situation , while the authorities completely failed to prepare for the storm , inform people or react in time ... 
  most credible source of information has been the social media . 
  official channels become unavailable or useless . 
  politicians blaming each other as usual . 
  when thousands got stuck on the road for the night , the ministry of internal affairs saw fit to send this truly helpful text message out : ** `` we are helping !, 
  do not leave your vehicle !, 
  if you run out of fuel get into another vehicle !, 
  the problem now is n't the cold or thick snow , it 's the wind that builds dunes of snow and buries cars . 
  vehicles with ordinary wheels would just get stuck . 
  maybe tanks are not the ideal vehicles to handle the situation but the resources of hungarian authorities , well , * limited * and there 're thousands on the road . 
  they use everything they can . 
  a few years ago i 've seen these things ( flour , rice , sugar , biscuits ) distributed in villages in western hungary too . 
  i 'm not sure this aid actually got where it was supposed to . 
  nevertheless the biscuits were delicious . 
  thanks for the correction . 
  i said it 's unknown because i could n't find any really convincing theories . 
  fun fact : the word for german in slavic languages - and hungarian , which has lots of slavic loanwords - originates from the word meaning ` silent , mute or dumb ' , probably because german settlers could n't speak the local language ... e.g. 
  german/mute in hungarian n\u00e9met / n\u00e9ma , in czech : n\u011bmec / n\u011bm\u00fd , in polish : niemiecki/niemy , in croatian : njema\u010dki / nemu\u0161ti edit : sorry , i just realised that it was already explained [ below ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1a7ydk/reurope_tell_us_about_the_name_of_your_country/c8v09z6 ), 
  i thought ` stan ' only means ` country ' . 
  nevertheless there are several exceptions to that rule . 
  hungary / ungarn / hongrie / vengrija : not originating from the word * hunger * . 
  the ancient hungarians were called * onogurs * , meaning `` people of the ten tribes '' . 
  however , ancient historians probably confused hungarian tribes with the bulgarian tribal federation who lived at the same area earlier . 
  although there 's a chance that hungarians belonged to that tribal alliance . 
  in french , the word onogur got a silent h , maybe because hungarians claimed to be relatives to the huns . 
  the word 's origin is unkknown . 
  1 : it 's fidesz , not fidesh 2 : most certainly it is n't equal to hungarians in general, 
  bunch of morons . 
  not to defend his politics , but he is no more dictator than berlusconi or ponta . 
  edit : also , i ca n't see why this would be a support to orban . 
  what about http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%a2uic%c4%83 ? 
  however , i thought romanians sell their fruit brandy under the trademark * p\u0103linc\u0103 * and the slightly different name only refers to the country of origin , but the beverages are essentially the same . 
  hungary could contribute with its invincible wmd : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a1linka i 'd certainly add romania , serbia , croatia and slovenia to the alliance because the * danubian federation battle group * sounds way more badass . 
  that must be a truy formidable military force ... 
  grilled ox heart with watercress salad for starter , and saddle back pork chops with prunes and mashed potato , then triple cooked chips for ` dessert ' . 
  monthly eating out with colleagues . 
  i thought that 's the legionary 's breakfast . 
  hungary can not into dialects . 
  hungary small . 
  for various geopolitical reasons i think it would be great to have a standing army and maintain military presence in certain important countries . 
  maybe it would be expensive but as long as we buy european weapons it 's just another way to pump money into eu economies . 
  un peacekeepers are frequently useless . 
  as the guardian wrote , pakistani , indian etc. 
  soldiers go to peacekeeping missions to get a pension , not to die there . 
  also i believe europe is somewhat responsible for the current state of several african countries and therefore it would be our task to restore or maintain order , prevent election frauds , protect young democracies etc. 
  a stable africa would be economically beneficial for eu companies too . 
  i 'm not talking about recolonisation of course . 
  although , at the moment the continent is on a good way to become a chinese playground . 
  also i 'm pretty sure the georgians would love to see some eu peacekeepers around . 
  yeah , canned liver pat\u00e9 is/was probably the cheapest source of protein you could buy :d although it has n't much to do with liver . 
  featuring the mistery ingredient * p\u00e1cs\u00f3 * ( `` marinating salt '' ) . 
  [ this song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv3seu-jbi8 ) is the hungarian side of the story . 
  here are the rather sad lyrics : * i walk out to the battlefield of doberdo * * and look up to the great starry sky * * starry sky , where is my hungarian homeland ? 
  * * where is my sweet mother crying for me ? 
  * * my lord , where will i die ?
