  * * where will my red blod spill ? 
  * * my grave will be in the middle of italy , * * my sweet mother , i ask you to not cry for me . 
  * * i 'm sending a letter with the post , * * it 'll find its way to my sweet mother 's house . 
  * * read , mother , my letter written with blood . 
  * * i 'm leaving my life at doberdo . 
  * * my sweet mother , i 'm writing no more letters . 
  * * a bullet has crossed my heart . 
  * * the lillies of the forest will cover me . 
  * * the girls in my village will cry for me . 
  i always thought [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkxunrryqd0 ) could be the true mirror of the german soul :d, 
  nevermind , you have [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owgzdynpaso ) instead :d, 
  that 's why i rather do n't post any hungarian songs from the time between ww1 and ww2 , when a generation was raised in the spirit of * `` you must take back everything '' * . 
  ( under the following communist dictatorship nationalist ideas were opressed , hence almost no patriotic songs were created . ), 
  it would be highly unrespectful to our neighbours and apart from the far right nobody in hungary thinks that we should invade them . 
  however , we do think that it 's important to protect the rights of ethnic hungarians living in other countries . 
  ( that 's not really what our goverment does though . ), 
  this is the anthem of the szeklers in transylvania ( not offensive against romanians ) : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz4sroekavc these are from the independence war against the habsurg empire in 1849-49 : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk6kbxkwth0 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzcennrvxai http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwnqjqnucbc ( old record from ww2 ) this is a famous march from another indenpendence war against the habsburgs around 1703 : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha7ch9zin70 finally , this might be odd , but nationalism and hard rock both were means for the youth to express their feelings against the communist regime in the '80s , hence a ` rock opera ' titled `` stephen , the king '' about the first king and the foundation of the hungarian kingdom has come to life . 
  the song from this musical are probably the most popular ` patriotic ' ones : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqyhae7hcaq http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upxq1wtqork http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-xehhhcrh4, 
  georgian beyond doubt . 
  cool alphabet , non-indo-european , sounds and words that make you try throwing up while speaking . 
  quite impossible to pronounce . 
  for starters , a major tourist attraction is the town of * \u10db\u10ea\u10ee\u10d4\u10d7\u10d0 / mtskheta * at the * \u10db\u10e2\u10d9\u10d5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8 / mtkvari * river . 
  however , my favourite word is * \u10d2\u10dd\u10d2\u10dd / gogo * = girl , chick, 
  according to my limited experience , they are hot indeed . 
  mostly brown hair , light brown skin , big eyes , tall and slim . 
  edit : the buildings must be relatively new . 
  when i was there 2yrs ago , both tbilisi and batumi looked as if the whole city had been ` under construction ' . 
  kinda reminds me of this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jumxhbefj9o, 
  yeah , [ raping and reaving throughout western europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_invasions_of_europe ) seemed to be a completely agreeble idea that time . 
  kinda suprising that it took the germans half a century to teach some civilised behaviour . 
  we moved to hungary from the ural mountains around a.d. 890 because our shamans had a prophecy that 1100 yrs later we will have excellent access to the german job market . 
  also the wine is pretty good . 
  oh lol , the following things within the same paragraph :  humongous number of people who are beyond sick and tired of their shit and would promptly descend into trasilvania with halberds of the sharpest steel and cleave them in half ...  constitution can not just be changed to account for whatever desires group x or minority y may have , that 's primitive tribalism and has no place in the 21st century . 
  you made my day , man . 
  you must be either a great troll or some real badass nationalist . 
  please go to budapest to see the upcoming football match and meet your hungarian counterparts . 
  speaking of trolling , let me leave this here for you : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsgg7bddiws, 
  impressive , but would this material withstand radiation and the extreme `` weather conditions '' of the moon ? 
  also i guess the printing process is not vacuum-compatible , so these blocks would be prepared in a pressurized environment . 
  keep in mind that the university students were n't demonstrating to protect their own interest - the new law has no implication for them . 
  the were protesting because they think this will destroy the future of the higher education , significantly reducing the number of new students in the coming years , and not only on the psychology courses . 
  lol translation of a nepszabadsag article , biased leftist newspaper . 
  brief introduction to hungarian politics for those who have nightmares about dictatorship : according to a poll from september , about the ** half ** of the voters would/could not vote for any parties ; they either do n't give a shit or would like to see the whole political elite in jail . 
  mr orban 's centre-right party would get only ** 23 % ** of the votes . 
  they won 2/3 majority for a reason in 2010 but then they managed to cause huge disappointment . 
  even the modified electoral system - that favours the winner - would n't be able to save them if there was a popular party in the opposition . 
  but the opposition sucks : the socialist party that led the country into economic disaster between 2002-2010 , provoked violent street clashes , etc. 
  has only ** 14 % ** ( mostly old people ) . 
  btw their politics has nothing to do with socialism , not even leftist , they 're just a bunch of ex-commie businessmen . 
  about ** 3 % ** goes to the miniature neocon party of the ex-commie ex-prime minister who left the socialist party after he realised he had screwed up everything big time . 
  ** 9 % ** of the voters supports the far-right jobbik . 
  those guys are absolutely out of touch with reality , but because of their populist rhetoric many desperate people in the countryside see them as the only party that cares about their problems . 
  the centre-left green party , the lmp has about ** 4 % ** . 
  formed in 2009 , probably they 're the least rejected party but since the elections they have failed to address the voters and gather support . 
  and a few weeks ago , another recycled ex-prime minister made his comeback , organizing an opposition coalition named `` together 2014 '' . 
  the guy was prime minister for only a year , and basically just followed the imf guidelines . 
  however , he is a close friend of the former ex-commie prime minister and his alliance does n't really have a program other than * `` come together '' * , * `` we must end the dictatorship '' * and * `` everything will be better '' * . 
  also , the parties of his coalition have diametrically opposing views on several issues . 
  summa summarum , as ** 46 % ** of the voters has no preference at the moment and hates the whole system , anything could happen in two years . 
  hungary 's lunatic economy minister keeps entertaining ... 
  this is not the first superficial article in this topic , written by this guy , marton dunai . 
  even more ironic that the article 's title is ` insight : ... ', 
   sorry if this sounds harsh but you do n't need a basic education to pull your dick out . 
  oh yes they do . 
  moreover , in hungary no one dies due to starvation or malnutrition . 
  they might live in poverty but miskolc is not uganda . 
  the government pays them a small amount of aid for each child - the more children they have the more money the got . 
  so , as a roma man , with no education , job or prospects , one more child means that you get more aid , and you can buy more beer in the pub ( instead of spending it on your children 's education or clothes for instance ) . 
  there was more than simply ` preserving greek and roman knowledge ' . 
  indeed , islamic civilisations ( and this term does n't equal to ` muslims ' ) learned much from greek , roman , persian , byzantine , indian , egyptian civilisations , but beside collecting and synthesizing , they significantly developed that knowledge . 
  mankind can be eternally grateful for this . 
  much of that knowledge could have been lost in the bloody mess of the migration period and the early middle ages and in 2012 a.d. we were n't debating on reddit . 
  however , i do n't think that technological and scientific progress is directly linked to religion - although we know some unfortunate exceptions . 
  but it 's more linked to the available resources , the overall condition of the society . 
  the arab world has seen rough times for quite a while , and the ` western civilisations ' are not really innocent in this . 
  these conditions are obviously inappropriate for scientific development , so it 's little wonder that qatar spends vast amounts of money to attract scientists and engineers from europe and not the other way around . 
  actually no one seems to be interested in a strong ` arab federation ' . 
  as long as they keep killing each other and provide cheap oil , us and eu are ok . yeah , we have immigrants and sometimes various buildings blow up , but we do n't have a really powerful arab rival . 
  ** divide et impera **, 
  algebra , astronomy , chemistry were cool stuff ( that 's more than ` numbers ' ... ) . 
  but ultimately it has not much to do with ` learning ' . 
  if we consider ` cultural diversity ' to be something worth preserving ( like biodiversity ) , then we simply can not allow certain things , such as minarets being built in switzerland , for instance . 
  it might sound racist but i do not deny the equality of different cultures . 
  i 'm just saying that they have their own places . 
  yeah , of course , borders and countries are not cast in stone , but that sort of change usually involves some bloodshed . 
  yeah , fortunately its use is fading . 
  i guess it was invented after ww1 when romanian forces briefly occupied budapest . 
  well , i sometimes heard it not exactly as swear word but rather as a synonyme for ` of inferior quality ' ( ` chinese ' as well ) , and sometimes used together with ` gypsy ' e.g. 
  * a rom\u00e1n cig\u00e1ny any\u00e1d * ( for other redditors : * your romanian gypsy mother * ) . 
  although in certain groups , * a rom\u00e1n kurva any\u00e1d pics\u00e1j\u00e1t * ( * the twat of your romanian whore mother * ) is quite common . 
  this is from an art movie : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4qcvdtbk_w, 
  yeah i reckon it 's an insult in britain , although i have n't heard so far  i 'm wondering whether the french use the term `` anglais '' as an insult . 
  hungarians use ` romanian ' in a similar way , although only people of the lower class ... never seen educated people using it . 
  i 'm not sure , the balkans swear words seem very convincing . 
  they 're equally witty and nasty . 
  but where 're the russians ? 
  and the french ? 
  just had a sudden clarity clarence moment ... :d, 
  that 's surprising . 
  i believed only gypsy and hungarian uses the word ` cancer ' in curses .
