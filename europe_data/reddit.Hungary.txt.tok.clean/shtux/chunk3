  it did n't happen once , it did n't happen twice . 
   1956 might have triggered ww3 . 
  yeah , stopping hitler from annexing sudetenland also might have triggered ww2 . 
  you did n't get your shit together until belgium was under attack . 
  okay , i may phrased that one wrong , but there 's really no point in being a smartass here . 
   main losers wth do you mean by that ? 
  that 's actually my point . 
  you got help . 
  funds from the usa to rebuild your country . 
  what did we got ? 
  revert every pre-war territory gains , 4 years of quasy-democracy , and after that , hardcore fucking broken-glass-stick-in-urethra tier communism , fucking up our economy and society for the next 100 years . 
  i ask again : who were the actual losers of that war in your opinion ? 
  what i tried to say is that from our standpoint , the reasons are indifferent . 
  whatever , dude . 
  did you help or not ? 
  not like that was the first time anyways . 
  1920 , 1848 , 1526 , etc. 
  either you fucked us up , or let others fuck us up , and this is just hungary . 
  the reasons do not really matter whatsoever , you simply did n't care about us . 
  i simply love the bavarian . 
   immediatly attacked and annexed by hungary ~ ~ dude pick up a history book . ~ ~ this is our trigger . 
  also , it was part of your made-up country for like , 20 years , and there are ( and also were ) more hungarians than slovaks . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_vienna_award edit : wow , i was wrong about that , we really did invade . 
  i always thought that it was included in the award . 
  i stand for the rest , though . 
  yeah , i always felt the irish close to us in many terms . 
  cheers bud , tomorrow everyone will think about you , 
  the continent is eur * \u00f3 * pa , while the moon is eur * o * pa in hungarian . 
  it 's pronounced the same though . 
  you 've never experienced the sensation of losing . 
  or at least not that much as we have had . 
  i mean , i was n't alive when we lost any of our wars or revolutions , but their legacy still lives on . 
  you have no idea what it 's like to be left alone . 
  your countries always helped each other , even after you took arms against each other , even after wwii . 
  and what about us ? 
  just an example : last year was the 60th anniversary of our failed revolution against the soviet occupation . 
  we took up arms , and said : enough is enough . 
  we asked for help , because we knew we could n't stand a chance alone . 
  but you were more interested in israel getting too much power in the middle-east , than helping a fellow european country in its struggle . 
  `` politics '' , you said , `` it is a really delicate situation '' . 
  and we fought , and died , and lost . 
  alone . 
  as always . 
  being constantly on the losing end of history leaves a mark . 
  it 's not always easy to be hopeful , trusting and tolerant for us . 
  not really a waste of money , they are fiscally independent from the state as far as i know . 
  he visits , because they are distant offsprings of a certain hungarian noble family of transylvania . 
  he 's not actively promoting anything , just likes the region , and likes to visit his ancestor 's homeland from time to time . 
  i 'm really excited about what 's going to happen . 
  the brexit , trump 's election ... 
  i did n't expect these events , but i 'm really glad that the tides are somewhat turned . 
  i think europe was following a wrong path . 
  i 'm not saying that right-wing populism is the ultimate solution for all of the west 's problems , but it is representing a large portion of the western society , so right now , the `` progressive '' left needs to address the questions they ask , and the reasons of their popularity , instead of calling right-wingers bigots and backwards , and following their own ideas blindly . 
  this situation will lead to a better future in the long run , so accept it , and go with the flow , 
  we are the best in waterpolo ( shut up serbs , you know it 's true ) , pretty good in fencing and in anything that involves rowing ( like canoe ) , decent in handball and swimming , and sometimes an extremely talented guy/girl emerges in random sports , like shooting , wrestling , sailing , table tennis and maybe a couple more i just forgot on the fly . 
  still , football remains the most popular sport smh ... 
  it was b\u00e9la i , who we call sometimes `` champion '' , but his , and his brother 's , andrew i 's nickname are used very rarely . 
  we also have joseph ii , `` the king with a hat '' , because he was never offically crowned as the king of hungary . 
  halusky with bryndza , sour creme , and bacon crumbs . 
  stuff of heavens , praise the slavs . 
  wake up around 7:45 , push the snooze button a few times , get up , wash face , dress up , take a walk to the university / the subway to work ( depends which day it is , after class , go to work ) , work a few hours , lunch at the diner , work again , take the subway to attend the evening class , groceries , at 9 pm finally arrive home , make lunch , then either fire up computer to browse reddit and facebook/play some shit , or go to the bar . 
  i usually get in bed at 1 am . 
  repeat . 
  halloween sometimes ( people like to dress up i guess ) , and interestingly enough , saint patrick 's is getting bigger every year . 
  i do n't know why , but it 's sure as hell we can realate to the irish in a lot of ways , so i do n't really mind . 
  true words , i believe you are right :d, 
  exactly what i wanted to say . 
  when breivik was imprisoned , i had an awkward laugh with my roommates , because he has better living conditions than most students here living in dorms . 
  the encounters are really rare . 
  there are some black guys/girls , mainly in budapest and debrecen ( the two biggest cities ) , but they are n't usually from america . 
  the tourists are just like any other american , they are loud as fuck , and have a shitton of money . 
  oh , and we have [ this ] ( http://www.biocity.hu/media/catalog/product/cache/0/thumbnail/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/c/l/classic.jpg ) candy . 
  i wonder what african americans think about it . 
  i do n't really know , but they are hilarious . 
  it 's kind of a meme party in hungary , even young people vote for them for the lulz sometimes . 
  their campaign posters are bad ass though , with old socialist artworks and stuff . 
  dessert : definitely [ soml\u00f3i galuska ] ( http://www.femcafe.hu/sites/default/files/images2014/8_recept/somloi_galuska_demedia_hu.jpg ) dish : screw guly\u00e1s , i nominate [ fisherman 's soup ( the tisa-version ) ] ( http://www.csajokmagazin.hu/admin/spaw2/uploads/images/utazas/szegedhalaszle.jpg ) . 
  my father made the best of this delicious shit , may he rest in peace . 
  i think about that time when being a prick was ok  look man , i 'm tired of being smartass here . 
  thoughts and beliefs may gain a different perspective over time , but being an asshat is eternal . 
  churchill was exactly that , with all due respect to his political achievements . 
  so if i understand corretcly , in your opinion it 's a mistake to judge hitler 's actions aswell ? 
  churchill was a prick . 
  i 'm a student with a half-time job , who lives at a friend 's flat ( thus the rent is about 50 % cheaper , than it would be ) . 
  it usually costs 40-50 % of my salary . 
  just the rent . 
  if it were n't for my friend , i would have to work 20 hours a week just to have a place to sleep . 
  it 's infuriating af . 
  obligatory budapest , as you mentioned , but since you are there , and still have time , i 'd suggest [ visegr\u00e1d ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visegr%c3%a1d ) ( it 's really cute , close to bp and the view is gorgeous from the castle ) , or if you have more time , [ esztergom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/esztergom ) ( the cathedral is pretty cool ) or [ eger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eger ) ( the castle is great , it has been renovated recently , you get to learn about hungarian history a lot there ) . 
  yep . 
  they ca n't even say budapest correctly most of the time . 
  we really do n't have any mexicans over here , and i think i just found an expert . 
  how the hell are you supposed to eat them ?? 
  ( i ate taco only once , in budapest , and i had practically no idea what to do with it , so i went full caveman . ), 
  not within the current borders , but felvid\u00e9k ( slovakia ) has hilarious accent , they say almost every vowel differently than the other dialects . 
  transylvania is also quite funny , they speak more slowly , and use absolutely hilarious words and expressions ( my favourite is the gyergy\u00f3-region ) . 
  within recent hungary , n\u00f3gr\u00e1d county and the city of miskolc compete for it imo , but this is debateable . 
  kis or kov\u00e1cs pista ( literally stevie little/smith ) , or sometimes gipsz jakab ( literally james bond . 
  yeah , the 007 . 
  i do n't know why do we use it , though . ),
