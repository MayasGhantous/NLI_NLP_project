  deleting the whole website , all archives and everything is just a normal business decision ? 
   also the newspaper did n't had some big story upcoming apparently they had one , and they also broke two big stories last week . 
   yeah , definitely evil orban 's hand again , everywhere and always . 
  no one argues that n\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g had financial problems ( just like pretty much every print media all over the world ) . 
  however , if this was a financial decision , they would n't have to abruptly ** delete ** the whole website overnight , they would n't have to fire their employees without notice overnight , they would n't have to lie to them about a party sunday only to greet them with the firings on saturday . 
  this is plain , ugly , and political . 
  yes , it 's orban 's hand again . 
  no , i meant the 200 . 
  where is that number from ? 
   there is a reason we require cars to be marked appropriately and drivers to be licensed after those experiences , and i can see why many drivers would be displeased for having sunk that cost only to be sidelined by a new service operating outside the rules . 
  even though this sounds logical , the vast majority of customers experienced better service with uber ( and i 'm not counting the prices which are admittedly due to the tax fraud ) . 
  taxis and taxi companies are just awful . 
  that 's a good point . 
  terrorism is on the rise since the year 2015 , but it 's lower than it was in the 80s . 
  i agree that it feels like it 's a lot more , but it 's a good reminder to check facts and not rely on feelings when it comes to things like this . 
  here are some statistics : http://www.datagraver.com/case/people-killed-by-terrorism-per-year-in-western-europe-1970-2015, 
  i think that 's right . 
  but also it 's practical . 
  why should we talk about something that fine , when there are so many things that are n't ? 
  i think there is some bias in the comments because usually people comment on issues , not things that work well ( and it 's rare to see a single article that 's about any success stories of the integration anyway ) . 
  what is it about ? 
  man , i really hope this general economic depression ends soon , because otherwise these far right extremists will gain support in many countries it seems . 
  interesting . 
  how much weed does one person usually smoke in one sitting ? 
  in budapest , hungary 20 eur ( ~ 5700 huf at today 's exchange rate ) buys you : * dinner for two at a cheap place * cinema for one in imax3d plus popcorn and drinks , or cinema for two without anything * 8-12 beers at a pub ( depending on the place ) , 20-24 in a grocery/liqour shop * 2 bottles of decent wine , 3-4 bottles of still-quite-good wine ( but do n't go cheaper than that if you like wine , haha ) * 20 l milk * travel 350 km by train * one pair of cheap jeans , 1-2 t-shirts * 13-15 l gasoline * 17 tickets for city public transportation ( must be validated each time you change a vehicle , so if you go by bus and metro you have to use two to reach your destination ) i 'm not really sure about the weed prices , someone please add that , it 's interesting to compare . 
  the killing happened three years ago , i 'm pretty sure that the extradition was denied previously . 
  oh it seems like our government is running out of things to screw up . 
  what next , a war with the neighboring states ? 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  what a bunch of idiots . 
   getting its act together sorry , what ? 
  a number of individuals committing crime does not define a country . 
  roma minorities are notoriously hard to help , and so they constantly live on the periphery of society . 
  i do n't think there is any affected country so far that was able to give a sufficient answer to this problem . 
  both forms are used , even in the media ( e.g. 
  i would n't say ker\u00e9kp\u00e1r is ancient or unused in hungary . 
  did i make any indication otherwise ? 
  yes , i acknowledge that these views are endorsed by a major hungarian political party . 
  and that really sucks , i must add . 
  but : what is your point ? 
  still not specific , but if you are implying that i condone the actions or words of jobbik or these speakers then you are very much mistaken . 
  quite the contrary , i think jobbik is a destructive force . 
  however , the linked post is filled with just as much hate and the statement that these events were not covered in the media is simply not true . 
  you almost cited the whole post . 
  could you be more specific ? 
  to be honest , this is not news , but a blog post . 
  and the author has just as much hate and frustration in him as the group of people he writes about ( jobbik & friends ) . 
  also , devecser was widely publicized in the media , it was basically everywhere ( how could it not have been ? ) . 
  yes , it sucks that there are stupid people , but the post is overly dramatic . 
   if those countries were never under soviet influence , their religiosity would be much lower . 
  hungary was under soviet influence as well ( and is poor ) but religion is not very high according to this map . 
  i do n't speak german well enough to comprehend that article at this late hour , but i know for a fact that at least some bad parts were thrown out of the proposal ( for example mandatory registration for bloggers ) . 
  in practice , freedom of press is not harmed by this law . 
  anyone can ( and do ) write anything they want , and they are not in danger for it . 
  one thing i can see is that the law is enforced more strictly , for example , the trashy main tv channels are regularly fined for crossing the lines ( think of showing gore in news at 7pm , boobs and fucking at 8pm in reality shows etc. ) . 
  i do n't think that 's a bad thing . 
  on the other hand , there was one ugly case , slightly related to the law itself . 
  attila mong , former chief editor of one of the main national radio news programs , chose to insert a minute of silence to openly protest the new law , and he was later fired ( allegedly not for this ) . 
  that 's pretty bad , although i do n't know how many governments would keep such a person in staff of the national radio . 
  is n't it really though ? 
  we are talking about people older than 90 years . 
  i think it looks quite pathetic when a shaking old person is dragged into court . 
  even though i 'm liberal and oppose our government in many of its decisions , i do think that the outcry from leftist media over the new media laws was overhiped and part of the fact they had nothing better to attack the government with at that time ( now they do , with all the corruption cases ) . 
  no wonder nobody talks about it anymore . 
  there are lots of fucked up things in hungary , but the press is free . 
  considering that it is a proper noun in either meaning ( the castle or the historical event ) , you are n't supposed to translate it . 
  on the other hand , `` tower '' is a common noun with a fitting translation , so should use it when you are speaking english ( and expect the other party to understand you ) . 
  thanks . 
  french people really do n't like speaking english , do they ? 
  you mean eiffel tower ? 
  * edit : do n't downvote me , i really do n't know what he meant . 
  is there a tour around the eiffel tower ? 
  btw i recently did a hitch-hiking trip from stockholm to budapest , and i thought sweden will win the beauty award , but in the end austria did with its extremely beautiful alps  . 
  also , sumerian heritage , and practically any powerful nation ever existed is considered predecessors by at least a few lunatics . 
  i do n't think mandiner is truly right-wing anymore . 
  apart from a few intellectual posts it had largely became a trollbait site which generates income from the copious amount of troll visiting and raging on the site . 
  i had a relevant question in another thread , and got a nice answer : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/v6jk4/greek_elections_first_polls_are_out/c51utzw, 
  what is the stance of each party on the crisis ? 
  yeah , it 's the other countries ' fault for not being successful . 
  makes sense . 
  this is exactly what i meant . 
  well , fuck . 
  to think that there are places where 87.5 % of pregnancies are aborted is scary . 
   second only to hungarian oooh yeah baby :d, 
  greeks tend to say that about every word , 
  jobbik , a similar hungarian party has got into the parliament two years ago . 
  they kept their 8-12 % percent up to this day . 
  me too :(, 
  at this point i 'm pretty sure he will . 
  still relevant - i think he needs to resign , precisely for the reasons you stated above . 
  that 's kind of what they said . 
  the conclusion was that he should keep his phd . 
  it has generated a huge public uproar , lots of publicity and even the otherwise faithful rightist media covered the issue in a ** very ** critical tone . 
  it seems that the only thing keeping mr. schmitt in office is viktor orb\u00e1n personally . 
  however , just a few hours ago the doctorate council of said university voted 16:2 to take recommend to take away the phd from him . 
  the final decision is up to the senate ( the highest decision-maker entities of universities are called senates in hungary ) . 
  at this point , it is very likely that mr. schmitt is going to resign ( although , before the announcement of the council decision he said * `` not for a minute i thought i should resign '' * ) . 
  google autocomplete is a golden mine of dumb stereotypes . 
  try < something  is ... or < someone is  ... and you will get tons of funny suggestions . 
  i think there are even websites that collect the best .
