  agreed . 
   everywhere in the world , he said , students were leftists . 
  it was only in hungary that we had met a conformist and fascist youth . 
  we tried to find an explanation for this -- to no avail . 
  this is indeed imre kert\u00e9sz 's hungary . 
  my problem is not with limiting budget autonomy per se , but the fact that this just came up . 
  had the eu have such regulations earlier it would n't bother me . 
  now they are making a decision that is hardly in the authority of eu . 
  that makes a bad precedence because it means that in the future the commission or the council can bend the rules to do what they want . 
  in my opinion this process should only go down by first changing and widely accepting eu legislation . 
  if the eu starts hand-controlling countries then it 's not the same eu that most countries joined . 
  the point is not how sensible an eu budget commissioner can or will be , but the fact that this radically changes the rules . 
  and where are the limitations ? 
  nothing is defined well and that 's a huge problem . 
  i think this idea is ( again ) a half-hearted response to the need for unified fiscal policy . 
  instead of taking away some sovereignty of fiscal policy from each member , they decided to just take them from greece . 
  that is better , right ? 
  because it only affects one country instead of 27 ( or 17 eurozone ) countries . 
  i do n't think that 's the case . 
  extremist claims that the eu is colonizing greece are less and less far-fetched once they start doing things like this . 
  what is the legal background of this , anyway ? 
  what happens if greece says `` fuck you '' ? 
  they have some military force , too . 
  or the next country that `` needs '' a budget commissioner from the eu ? 
  this is a very , very bad idea . 
  there was an interesting article about sopa protesting by maddox here : [ `` i hope sopa passes '' ] ( http://maddox.xmission.com/ ) . 
  in short : * `` protest schemes that do n't cost the participants any inconvenience , hardship or money remain the most popular , despite their ineffectiveness . '' * . 
  this is true . 
  clicking around on the internet and signing a petition between two cat videos does nothing . 
  there needs to be real protesting . 
  sopa may have failed , but these lobby forces are still there . 
  they will reword and rename it and will try again . 
  same with acta . 
  i did make a detailed response ( see below ) . 
  sadly , by the time i wrote this , the post was out of the frontpage . 
  i 'm no supporter of fidesz ( quite the opposite ) , but i have a couple of problems with this article . 
  he treats the question of changing the constitution as if it was something a country is not allowed to do . 
  it is . 
  there are good reasons to change the now-previous constitution of hungary . 
  a debate is only valid about the changes it brought . 
  my reflections on his arguments : 1 . 
  ** fidesz and the 2/3 of seats ** . 
  he is right about the electoral system being imperfect . 
  when a party gets 55 % of the votes , they should n't have 68 % of the seats . 
  however , electoral systems are inherently unjust one way or another - i think there was someone who got a nobel price for proving this . 
  the second part of the argument is that fidesz , according to recent polls , is unpopular . 
  but show me a party in any country that is popular in the middle of their 4 year period , in this economical crisis . 
  ** public consultation ** i agree with this point 3 . 
  ** consultation with the eu ** i do n't know whether this is true or not . 
  my opinion is that there are several problems with the constitution and the way the government acted , but the foreign reaction might be overheated by the our government 's arrogant attitude in the past months . 
  ** replacing communist constitution ** . 
  this is true . 
  the previous constitution was written in 1949 , in the middle of communist oppression and was patched up in 1990 . 
  i can believe that technically it would have worked ( it workd for a good 20 years ) but i agree that the symbolic step of replacing it is required . 
  ** `` the preamble asserts that sovereignty rests in the hungarian `` nation '' ( that is , ethnic hungarians and not hungarian citizens of all ethnicities ) '' ** this is simply a false statement . 
  the preamble states ( in the official translation ) : * the nationalities living with us form part of the hungarian political community and are constituent parts of the state . 
  * and * the source of public power shall be the people . 
  * ( article b/3 ) . 
  ** `` it also includes potentially destabilizing references to hungary 's `` historic constitution '' that implicitly laid claim to territories now belonging to neighboring states . 
  '' ** an `` implicitly laid claim '' is just an opinion , so i ca n't really disprove it . 
  if i 'm right , he was referring to the following part : * `` we promise to preserve the intellectual and piritual unity of our nation torn apart in the storms of the last century . * . 
  personally i do n't see anything wrong with this . 
  ** translation mistakes ** - true , and i do n't which is worse : if it was intentional or truly an accident . 
  both sucks for a government . 
  ** private members ' bills ** - true , this is their way of abusing the 2/3 of votes . 
  they are writing laws as if the parliament was a factory . 
  it 's true that the constitution reflects christian values , but i do n't think there is much problem with that . 
  being an atheist myself ( not the agressive redditor atheist stereotype ) , i do n't see how this would effect me or my freedom to choose my beliefs . 
  in my opinion , the following are the real problems with the constitution : * reduced checks and balances * marriage defined as `` between man and woman '' ( although , the author says `` ban on gay marriage '' which is misleading ) . 
  * reduces codification of human rights * the constitutional court is weakened * ombudsman system changed by ending several positions . 
  * tax and pension laws to require 2/3 of parliament votes to change, 
  damn , i was looking for a clue and found the `` mr '' addressing ( obviously it was in the answer directed to op ) . 
  so . . yeah , 
  what exactly did you write him ? 
  is there a site that sums up acta ( as many did with sopa/pipa ) ? 
  yeah , i never really understood that ... why is it so ? 
  if we continue to have legislation that undermines any attempt to produce electronics in the eu , then yes , the status quo wo n't change . 
  you are right , import tax is probably not the greatest burden on a business like this ( at least , today ) , but at least we should n't create artificial ones like that . 
  this kills innovation . 
  i 'm looking forward to the day when no one will get why you are asking this . 
  it 's a thing of the past , most people who lived then ( and had any effect on changing the borders ) are dead ( even people who were born in those days probably ) . 
  sure it sucked greatly for hungary , but we are a different generation now . 
  we were born into our countries as they are today . 
  also , they should n't be allowed to be there . 
  [ this is how i feel ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8ibnfkcrsm ) ( with president orb\u00e1n being king arnulf ) . 
  * everyone stay calm !, 
  this is not happening !, 
  do they ? 
  but it 's a news channel , not the average joe . 
  ( for the record , i did n't downvote you ) of course i agree that we should n't let people to have sex on the streets . 
  but that does not imply that we should n't let gay people to marry ( an analogy is never an argument ; analogies are meant to explain , not to prove a point ) . 
  you are saying it 's because that 's the way things are . 
  well , not too long ago , women were treated as second-class citizens , they were n't allowed to vote for example . 
  that was the way things were . 
  does that mean it should n't have changed ? 
  also , not too long ago , slavery was widespread in the us . 
  that was the way things were . 
  see the pattern ? 
  marriage is not only about tax reliefs . 
  there are plenty of childless but married straight couples .
