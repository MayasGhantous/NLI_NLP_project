  you could also argue that childless leaders are the most concerned with the future , since their only way to cheat death is to ensure that future generations will remember them . 
  on the other hand leaders with a lot of children do n't need to concern themselves , since their genetic line is much less probable to go extinct . 
  but they all stand on their own feet , princess rachel already said so much !, 
  in hungary calvinists are actually those who traditionally have fewer children . 
  also orb\u00e1n is not genuinely religious . 
  he started his political career as a sceptical , liberal edgelord , and made fun of religious people on multiple occasions publicly . 
  we have no reason to assume that his current stance towards religion is anything else then pretension for political gains . 
  and even if he * really had a change of heart , and is religious now , not just the cynical opportunistic bastard i surmise he is , he never strongly associated with his own denomination , not even after he went over to the right . 
  if i remember correctly all of his children were christened by a methodist priest . 
  food is of strategic importance , you generally do n't want to be dependent on others . 
  if your home-grown food is too expensive people will buy cheap imported food , your agriculture shuts down , and whenever shit hits the fan you are there with millions of starving people . 
  not cool . 
  so i would say it 's a good thing to spend taxpayers money on , it might save their lives in the future . 
  it would n't be personally better for me , it would be better for those millions who have been persecuted because of there mother tongue , whose lands were confiscated , who were expulsed from there homelands , and were generally treated as second class citizens . 
  and it is still going on . 
  you can parade with every flag in romania , but if you have a hungarian flag , or a szekler flag ? 
  fined . 
  just a few days before the romanian mayor decided to take off the hungarian signs in targu mures , in a city , where the hungarians make up the 45 % of the population . 
  why ? 
  because they can do it . 
  just like in the case of the 2009 slovak language law . 
  they were bluffing . 
  there is no way they would have risked french lives so that one of their backwater ally might have a little more land . 
  the war in turkey turkey has shown that . 
  and with the treaty of trianon also millions of hungarians went to other countries . 
  i do n't mind that romania or czechoslovakia got territories , where their respective nationality was in majority , however , with a successful war against them , we could have reached a just peace , like turkey did , where ethnically hungarian territories could have stayed with us . 
  unluckily for us , the first government after the secession from austria trusted the entente , and the promises of wilson about national autonomy , so they just scrapped the army . 
  and in the meantime hungarian government was paying for the weapons of romanian territorial militias ... now , that 's a whole new level of incompetence . 
  then the communists took over , started to rebuild the army , but in the meantime they also started purges , so that a lot of soldiers , like horthy rather fought against them , and made a pact with romanians . 
  bad luck in our leaders , as i said . 
  if we have beaten the romanians and the slovaks , like turks did with the greeks , we could have had just borders so majority hungarian territories could have stayed with us . 
  good for them they had an atat\u00fcrk . 
  bad for us , we only had a k\u00e1rolyi and a linder . 
  oh and a kun and a horthy ... bad luck , really . 
  obligatory `` why is marocco so jakubmarian.com '' joke . 
   also , there is no death penalty in the entire eu , not even for war time crimes i am pretty sure hungarian law allows court martials to impose death penalty . 
   there 's no fucking war [ if you say so . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_on_terror ), 
  strange . 
   no martial courts in france . 
  that would be pretty strange . 
  so if a soldier commits an act of insubordination , his case gets to a civilian court ? 
  well , everybody has the right for a trial , that 's true , and if they are taken as prisoner , traitors should have a trial as well . 
  however , if they take arms against the legal government , or against an ally of this , taking them as prisoner should be a lower priority then keeping our soldiers or the soldiers of an allied army alive . 
  so yes , the proper way to do it , is to take them as prisoner , try them , convict them , and execute them ( like brutus did with his sons ) , but killing them on the battlefield is almost as fine , given they are the aggressors in this case . 
   well i thought we have grown up a bit since the middle ages with the rule of law and all this . 
  furthermore we do n't believe in the death penalty anymore . 
  i am pretty sure that high treason committed in war time by a citizen who is eligible for draft , falls under the jurisdiction of martial courts , which means that they can and should be executed . 
  a trial is of course necessary if they are taken as prisoners , but if we happen to meet them on the battlefield ( or an ally of us , in this case ) , there is no law which protects them from being killed , and there should n't be one either . 
  killing someone who committed high treason is a very old and noble european tradition . 
  it goes back to l. j. brutus executing his own sons for conspiracy against the republic . 
  well , that is , if it really happened , and it 's not just livy making up things . 
  nevertheless , whether it 's true or not , it is a cool , edifying story about commitment , duty , honour , and killing the bastards who commit high treason . 
  i have never heard anybody claiming tesla would be hungarian . 
  it was an inside job . 
  yeah , i do n't understand either why would be vlach offensive , but whatever . 
  maybe italians have tougher skin ? 
  orsz\u00e1g = land szag = smell we called romania ol\u00e1horsz\u00e1g ( vlachland ) originally , but for some reason it was deemed to be offensive , so we switched to the same name you were using .

  you can have me , but let my pierogi go !, 
  let him go , or i will cut your moldova 's throat !,

  that 's why you never go r/outside . 
  such a strange sub , and sunlight is positively uncomfortable . 
   apparently are not allowed to decide if they want kids or not they are discouraged ( note they can still have their pill , it 's just that the procedure is made somewhat more inconvinient ) to kill an already conceived child , but nobody restricts birth control in general , condoms and birth control pills are still available without prescription . 
  just for the record , while i think it 's morally wrong to murder an unborn child , i also despise etatist solutions like this . 
  more country has tried in the past ( e. g. romania under ceau\u0219escu ) , and while the restriction of abortion does save some children , it also kills a lot of women , because they turn to charlatans , who of course botch the job , and kill the mother alongside the child . 
  french is just a bastardised version of latin with some germanic words . 
  after you learnt latin , learning french , italian , spanish etc. 
  takes half as much time as it would normally , so in the end you actually spare time with learning latin .

  netherlands is more gender then sweden ? 
  i did n't expect anybody will be more gender then sweden . 
   and we should cap the voting age at 45 why bother with these unnecessary rounds ? 
  first taking away political rights , marginalising them , taking property away , isolating them in the name of the greater good ( the greater good ! ), 
  it 's slow af . 
  let 's spare ourselves some time , shall we ? 
  just go full pol pot , and start with the ones who wear glasses . 
   and really feel for the people who are dealing with this situation in the front lines , when other countries refuse to help . 
  i think poles will gladly help to enforce schengen borders , italy and greece only needs to ask . 
  they helped us , when we asked . 
  that 's a pretty stupid generalisation . 
  russians did have a solzhenitsyn after all , and some others who spoke out against the glorification of stalin . 
  some russians also speak out against putin , heck , some russians payed with their lives for speaking out against putin , others currently sit in prison . 
  the potential that they will change for the better is there , and only time will tell , if it will happen or not .

  being edgy and punching a straw man does n't really help us to solve this issue . 
  it is bad enough that well , * some people * cry nazi every time someone mentions changing immigration policies . 
  we are supposed to help them to get rid of their prejudices to create an honest discussion , not reinforcing their stereotypes . 
  edit : btw mena people are predominantly white . 
  why do n't we just drop the idea of enforcing immigration policies on the whole union ? 
  in the us even cities can have different immigration policies , so why could n't we do the same with a bunch of independent countries ?
