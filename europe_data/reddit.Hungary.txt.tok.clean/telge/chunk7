  it can be very profitable for the host country , if it does like the us : only takes high-qualified , or already rich , or diligent people . 
  and then these people very quickly assimilate , most of the time . 
  immigration is bad as western-european countries are doing it . 
  they take way too much unqualified people for cheap labor . 
  and then they wonder why they are not able to integrate them , and why do the people with immigrant background have way higher crime rate than natives . 
   more countries should be doing this imo . 
  all eu countries should be doing this . 
  that is basically the best way to use our money . 
  but this alone will not do anymore . 
  the other things we should do is close the eu-borders ( all of them ) , and deploy all the navies to the mediterranean to force human smuggling boats to go back to their country of origin . 
  and after that happens we should confiscate/sink those ships to put an end to this damned business . 
  i guess the governments of middle-eastern and north-african countries get their fair share from the profits , and sinking ships on their waters is probably illegal , so we should pay them off as well so they allow us to operate on their waters ( some laws will have to be changed for that , i guess ) , and they cooperate with us . 
  on land the human smuggling is mostly done by our own citizens , so we should impose really harsh punishments for this . 
  moreover we should set up an international police department ( if it does n't already exist ) which would concentrate on smuggling , so we can fight it efficiently . 
  that 's europe for you , old chap . 
  bureaucracy for the sake of bureaucracy . 
  however it might work out against migrants , if they do not figure how to game the [ system ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtekumyecnk ) . 
  too much paperwork . 
  i do n't think anybody will . 
  and thanks for the support , 
  sorry  i even had a conversation with you the other day . 
  it 's embarrassing . 
  so you leave kebab removing to germans ? 
  where is your spirit serbia ? 
  `` slovak nationalists sided with habsburg emperors against kossuth separatists '' in 1848 there was no word about secession or separatism . 
  the hungarian armies fought for the laws signed by the king himself . 
  even after 14th april ( 1849 ) , most of the army was against secession , the officers of the iii . 
  corps for example assured g\u00f6rgey , that they would follow him , if he wanted to march against debrecen . 
  there was also a big party in the parliament , which still wanted to conciliate with vienna . 
  so the question of secession was far from being decided , when the russian intervention ended the civil war . 
  had our side won , there probably would have been an other civil war about it . 
  also , while the slovaks siding with vienna is a widespread myth , actually you guys had smaller percentage of the population fighting on the side of the austrian army , then hungarians . 
  the so called slovak revolution consisted around two-thousand volunteers , while alone in the vii . 
  corps there were * three * pure slovak battalions , and a lot mixed . 
  the most famous partly slovak battalion was probably the 9th , the famous red-hatted soldiers from kassa . 
  i understand , that you look at 1848 through the glass of the decades after 1867 , but make no mistake , in 1848 we fought together against the armies of franz joseph , not under the banner of an independent hungary , but in the name of ferdinand v . it is quite surprising how misinformed most people are about the 1848/49 war , about the goals or the ideas of the so called revolutionaries . 
  in fact , most of the officers and soldiers in the hungarian army would be pretty upset that we now label them as such , since they saw themselves as the protectors of the constitution which was sanctioned by king in april 1848 . 
  they hated the idea of secession or republicanism with passion , just as much as they hated windisch-gr\u00e4tz and the other de facto leaders of austria , who removed the rightful king with a coup d'\u00e9tat , and thereby created a rift in the ranks of the k. und k. army . 
  if you want to learn more about the war , i can really advise you to read the memoirs of [ g\u00f6rgey ] ( https://archive.org/stream/meinlebenundwirk01gruoft#page/n9/mode/2up ) . 
  he writes in a very enjoyable style , and he is n't gentle with anyone , not even with himself . 
  and that 's why you never take your transylvania to the brothel , children !, 
  i had to learn it the hard way ... 
  a descendant which never fails to disappoint its ancestors . 
  [ that 's why the true heir is ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tolq9ih.png ), 
  boooooooo . 
  but seriously , why would you think that ? 
  french is just one of the vandalised versions of latin . 
  why would you want to learn a weak imitation instead of the glorious , beautiful and great original ? 
  glad you liked them :d, 
  this is for you as well , u/jamie54 !, 
  most scottish jokes are about the stinginess of scots . 
  actually , the word scot itself has the second meaning today in hungarian , `` stingy '' . 
  if somebody says you `` do n't be such a scot ! '', 
  he/she means you should care less about money . 
  ( as if being stingy would be a bad thing . 
  on to some jokes !, 
  the old scot is on his deathbed , and the whole family is gathering around him . 
  he asks in his dying voice : `` is my son here ? '', 
  `` yes dad , i am here . '', 
  `` is my daughter here ? '', 
  `` of course dad , i am here . '', 
  `` is my wife here ? 
  are my grandchildren here ? '', 
  `` we are all here . '', 
  if the whole family is here , why the hell is the light on in the kitchen ?! '', 
  the scot arrives home from work , and he sees his son kicking the kid of the neighbours on the ground . 
  he yells at him : `` stop right there !, 
  what the hell do you think you are doing ?!, 
  that shoe is brand new ! '', 
  two scots are talking in the bar . 
  `` and my wife has her name-day and birthday on the very same day . '', 
  `` what a remarkable coincidence ! '', 
  why the hell do you think i married her on the first place ?! '', 
  ( explanation : in hungary we give presents each other on name-day , just like on birthdays . ), 
  the english , the irish and scot plan a meal together . 
  `` i bring the meat '' says the english . 
  `` i bring the bread '' says the irish . 
  `` and i will bring my brother '' announces the scot . 
  the scot decides to buy his girlfriend a lipstick as a birthday-present . 
  his friend asks why . 
  `` well , because that thing i will get back from her over time . '', 
  the scot catches his wife in flagranti . 
  he takes out his gun , and says to the guy : `` now lie on the top of her again , so i do n't have to shoot twice ! '', 
  the old scottish couple goes to the restaurant . 
  they order a sandwich . 
  when they get it , the man halves it , and starts eating . 
  the waiter asks bewildered : `` do n't you want to eat too , ma'am ? '', 
  `` soon . 
  i just wait till my husband finishes , so i can have our denture . '', 
  mackenzie and macdonald are walking home from the bar in the night . 
  suddenly a bandit stops them with a gun . 
  `` hand over all your valuables ! '', 
  mackenzie says : `` macdonald , do you remember those fifty pounds i owe you ? 
  i would like to repay it , if you do n't mind . '', 
  and last but not least one , which is not about the stinginess of scots , but nevertheless it is a lovely piece : the scot tells his friends about his adventures in london . 
  `` believe me , when i say , those english are all mad as a hatter . 
  that crazy guy in the hotel for example : at 3 a. m. he just bursts into my room , starts screaming , wawing and swearing . 
  bloody horrible . '', 
  `` and ? 
  what have you done ? '',
