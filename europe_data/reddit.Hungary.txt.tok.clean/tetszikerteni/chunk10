  i hope we 'll find out . 
   several ngos rescuing migrants off shore `` rescuing '' : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rgwks2uawy, 
   l\u00f6rinc m\u00e9szar\u00f3s  andr\u00e1s decs\u00f6 what i 'll never understand is how can high profile journalists make grammatical mistakes every time they write about hungarian politics . 
  you have the fucking internet in front of you , just google how they write their names for fuck 's sake . 
  pro tip for foreign journalists : if you have no idea about our moonrunes , just leave everything off . 
  it 's better that way . 
   in october , orb\u00e1n loyalists shut down n\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g ( people 's freedom ) , a critical newspaper . 
  which has had an austrian owner , and which has been operating with negative profit for the last couple of years , losing subscribers literally every day , and building up quite a lot of debt . 
  also , it was founded by mszmp , the hungarian worker 's socialist party , [ back in 1956 ] ( http://epa.oszk.hu/00900/00987/00001/pdf/00001.pdf ) , later `` passed to '' mszp . 
  mszp also sold their share of the paper a couple of years ago , so they had no legal ties to it right now . 
  but these are irrelevant details , when our number one way to reach people with anti fidesz rhetoric is in danger . 
   surveys show that 67 percent of hungarians believe their government is corrupt , and yet it still enjoys high approval ratings . 
  because hungarians also believe that every alternative he could have ( especially from the left ) are at least equally corrupt , or have absolutely no competence in politics . 
  the quality of my comment reflects that of the article . 
  i think it 's a weak one for not citing it 's source other than `` senior minister '' . 
  the last sentence ( out of a total of 4 ) has nothing to do with the topic . 
  my `` yeah , nah '' was more directed towards the implied question of this comment section : `` would you like to discuss this article ? 
   hungary forgot to take its medicine it seems . 
  you can disregard anything he says . 
  he 's vice pm because he is the leader of the christian democratic people 's party ( they are needed for fidesz to ensure election results ) , and he 's a great insurance policy for orb\u00e1n . 
  nobody wants him as pm , so orb\u00e1n can sleep well . 
   misbehaving badly i gather ( google translate ) they were find guilty ( convicted ? ), 
  of the following crimes : robbery , fighting , vandalism , intimidation and spit at people . 
  is this correct ? 
  if it is , `` misbehaving '' is not the right term . 
   please explain what you mean by this question , because i ca n't even begin to comprehend the comment i wanted it to be provocative . 
  basically its a chicken and an egg problem . 
  eu criticises hungary , hungary criticises the eu . 
  the constant media pressure from europe does n't help either . 
  better example would be the refugee situation . 
  hungary criticises eu for how they approach the problem , and the eu is criticising hungary , for `` not doing their part '' , and their `` mistreatment of migrants '' . 
  in my opinion our government does n't want to do whatever the eu wants for two reasons , both of which are beyond the actual problem in question . 
  in this case , fidesz judged the country 's opinion in the issue ( they also helped forming it with propaganda , but it was n't a 50-50 kind of thing anyway ) . 
  they realised jobbik would gain immense support for their anti migrant rhetoric , which could have been a problem for fidesz . 
  fidesz tactics 101 says , take the strong talking points of your opponent , and present them as your own . 
  they did it , and it worked . 
  the other reason is also a fidesz ( mainly orb\u00e1n ) thing : be the rebel . 
  orb\u00e1n was trained to be against the `` evil socialist '' system , fighting as the underdog . 
  now the eu is attacking him without realising this is home ground for him . 
  they ca n't undermine his support in hungary by forcing him into a corner , which would normally work with literally anyone else . 
  thanks for explaining . 
  the us is clearly ahead of hungary in this aspect , as i 've said somewhere , we 're less than a 30 year old `` democracy '' , where half of the people have no concept about it , other than `` now i can complain in public '' . 
  because they do n't want to get sued . 
  that 's a big if though . 
  most of fidesz studied law in university , i 'm sure they paid attention to these legal details , as they have with every law related issue they touched . 
  for example , our fence on the southern border , actually goes a few meters inside the country . 
  this gives them the ability , to throw people over it , while still not forcing them into serbia . 
  serbia ca n't do anything , eu ca n't do anything . 
  they 're so good at this , it hurts . 
   all kinds of trash from the likes of / r/the _ donald , / r/conspiracy , / r/wikileaks , / r/hillaryforprison and others ... [ that 's just , like , your opinion , man . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwdd6_zxx8c ), 
  right , i kind of missed to state my point . 
  i wrote it down , because i wanted to give an example with enough insight on why the eu ca n't really enforce `` liberal democracies '' in a democratic way , as / u/sopadurso would have it :  eu is a union of liberal democracies , if a country does not want to be one then i guess it can join euro asia union with all the other phony democracies they so much want to be like . 
  please read my concern about forcing a government to respect its own constitution here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5kow4e/poland_is_not_descending_into_tyranny_its_just/dbpwon5/ tl ; dr : * hungary has elected a government fair and square in 2010 , * they achieved an unprecedented majority , allowing them to change the constitution , and even the constitutional court , who could call them out on it . 
  * they did change stuff . 
  * we 're talking about a country , who 's been only allowed to think about `` democracy '' for less than 30 years . 
  * who should enforce `` liberal democratic values '' on the government of hungary ? 
  how ? 
  i ca n't really talk about poland , i have very little knowledge on their current affairs , so i 'll stick to my hungarian example . 
  in my previous example , i was talking about hungary 's 2010-2014 government . 
  fidesz ( union of young democrats ) and kdnp ( christian democratic people 's party ) ran as a single entity , and they achieved the majority they needed to change anything , including the constitution . 
   this is the thing , a majority 's government is ** not allowed to ** change whatever it wants , its restricted precisely to preserve the democratic regime that allowed then to be elected . 
  the government is *** not supposed to *** change whatever it wants . 
  what restricts the government ? 
  the constitution ? 
  the constitutional court ? 
  what happens , when the government does change something they 're not supposed to ? 
  what can the people of hungary do , when the ruling government decides to change the composition of the constitutional court , nominating and electing ( super majority ) loyal justices ? 
  who should , or who could enforce these democratic values ? 
  in the usa , the answer would be simple : we the people , with the 2nd amendment . 
  here , we do n't have anything . 
  they 've been elected fair and square in 2010 , now their support is dropped a little , but they will stay in power thanks to the amount of supporters they have . 
  should the army seize control ? 
  we would be like third world dictatorships , coup after coup , as the weather changes . 
  so , what can we do ? 
  the only thing we have , is voting for the opposition . 
  however , they are even worse , and less competent in every department , or parts of their philosophy is even more unacceptable in the eu . 
  basically orb\u00e1n and his government could do whatever they wanted to in their four years between 2010-2014 . 
  and they pretty much did . 
  what restricts the government ? 
  eu laws and courts ? 
  eu sanctions ? 
  the eu can not ( and should not ) interfere with local elections , that would undermine their `` liberal democracy '' picture . 
  so what can they do ? 
  punish countries with sanctions , for having a government who does `` evil , anti democratic '' things . 
  who does the eu think will pay for these sanctions ? 
  the wrong doers ? 
  no , of course not , we will , the people . 
  maybe not today , but surely our future and our children will . 
   use state funded media as a propaganda channel for the party in power i 've touched on this above , orb\u00e1n was elected in the past fair ( regarded by the left ) system . 
  they did n't use government media as propaganda at the time . 
  the left screwed up so badly , they wo n't even recover for a long time ( not for the next elections , that 's almost certain ) . 
  then they made the changes you say , but even without the state media , they ran basically unopposed . 
  the left did n't recover , their only opponents were ( even more right wing ) jobbik . 
  today they 're still in power , only a couple of seats less than they would normally need for anything . 
  right now , they only have enough , to run smooth , without any discussion with the opposition . 
   and at the same time diabolize any media that presents a different picture you could say , they are doing this now . 
  they refuse interviews with journalists they regard as `` opposition '' , and the left blames them for the closing of a newspaper which was battling bankruptcy for years . 
  this however , should n't grant orb\u00e1n and his boys the numbers they achieved previously . 
  the opposition could defeat fidesz in some local elections this past year , but fidesz is already proposing lower taxes , more money for the people , which will overturn any concern their supporters might have had towards their battered `` liberal democracy '' .
