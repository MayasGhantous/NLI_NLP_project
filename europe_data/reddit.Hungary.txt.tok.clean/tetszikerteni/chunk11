   eu is a union of liberal democracies what is the difference between a democracy , where the ruling government has a super majority in the parliament ( enabling them to change anything they want ) , and a `` phony democracy '' ? 
   nice try but its not eastern europe evil right wingers , its hungary and poland evil right wingers , according to the [ un ] ( http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/worldageing19502050/pdf/96annexii.pdf ) , both hungary and poland are eastern european . 
  where did i do wrong ? 
  anyway , i 'm sure it 's right wingers in general , eu 's only problem is they actually managed to gain power in these countries ( i could say , in eastern europe  ) . 
  so basically , fascism = negation ( my beliefs ), 
  you mean when the eu is trying to hide its failings by blaming the `` evil right wing '' in eastern europe ? 
   your absolute priority on `` our people '' is something i disagree with back in the day ( way back ) why did people form tribes ? 
  why did they settle together , hunt together , live together ? 
  to increase their chance of survival . 
  today , we expect the same from our countries . 
  we expect our leaders , our decision makers , to favour us over anyone else . 
   your average us citizen is more likely to commit a murder in the eu than a refugee is to commit an act of terrorism . 
  the difference is , there is n't a us based terrorist group who publicly stated they intend to kill us . 
  or even if there is , their number and power is far lower than those of isis . 
   what you are saying is that , compared to one eu citizen millions of refugees ' well being or even life is worthless as i explained above , i want my country , to favour me , my family , my friends , my neighbours , the people i 'm culturally closest to , over anyone else . 
  what else would be the point in living in countries ? 
  if the politicians i have elected start to prioritize anyone else , i will dislike it . 
  their lives are n't worthless . 
  if they are in danger , we should probably help . 
  but why must this burden fall on the eu , and only the eu ? 
  why do n't we pressure saudi arabia to help ? 
  they are closer in the region , they are closer to syrians culturally than europe , and they also certainly could afford to do it . 
   regardless of how tragic any death may be , there are plenty of things that could be done to keep people safer that would save more eu citizens ' lives than kicking out refugees . 
  sure , let 's try to do something about those problems as well . 
   kicking out refugees kicking out people would be more difficult , than denying entry to any newcomers . 
   the ratio of eu/us muslim residents vs terrorist attacks is very low ( like one per million ) , i do n't like it when people are playing down the deaths of others , because the statistics are low . 
  there 's about 55 million deaths per year , and relatively low number of car related deaths . 
  why should we care about driving under the influence ? 
  at what ratio would it start being important to you ? 
   it 's not like every muslim is plotting a slaughter at this very moment . 
  you are right , they are n't . 
  but there are some who are . 
  i think , if we can prevent the death of our people ( even if it 's only 1 person ) , it 's worth to try . 
  right now , we do n't have a better idea , than denying entry of anyone from that region . 
  when anyone comes up with something better , i 'm sure both sides will debate it . 
   australia-style camps is my best bet that would be my idea too . 
  eu could do this easily , member countries would have to sign 1 document , which says such entries will be denied of refugee status and benefits , and later ( after documentation ) transported back to wherever they came from . 
  expensive , but it would discourage anyone , who 's currently risking their own money and life . 
  however , instead of this , they chose to let people in at the rate they 're coming , and they will continue this way , until their local support has fallen to a point where they feel their power is in danger . 
  they already look like headless chickens trying to figure out what to do . 
  is this the first time sea side countries have to protect their sea ? 
   something something be the change you want to see i do n't speak memes , so i might misunderstand you now . 
  let 's say i accept 5 families into my house . 
  i provide them with everything they need . 
  how does that change the opinion of half of my country ? 
   for starters , not treating every refugee like a potential murderer . 
  how could we enforce a decision like that ? 
  how could we change the opinion of those who disagree with us ? 
  yes , it is . 
  at what number does it become a real danger to you ? 
  1.5 million ? 
  6 million ? 
   they 're `` throwing their own lifes away '' because you 're not accepting them . 
  if you pretty much act like isis told them you would act , they 're going to start trusting isis more and more . 
   the local radicals are you . 
  if even the ones who were born here act like the ` evil right wing ' told us they would act , we 're going to support the ` evil right wing ' more and more . 
  seriously . 
  what do you suggest we should do , to ` not make the lies of isis come true ' ? 
   now tell me , how many europeans in total have been killed by radical islamic terrorism since 9/11 ? 
  [ about 559 more than should have . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrorism_in_europe#list_of_incidents ), 
   i 'm trying to explain why we should be accepting of refugees and muslims in general . 
  and you do that , by saying this :  they want you to fear innocent people , to hate them , so the innocents will hate you too , and join isis 's cause . 
  the fact that the innocent muslims we should accept , ** might ** throw their own lives away in the process of murdering us , due to them being harassed by radical locals , does n't really convince me to accept any of them . 
   how can i stop what i never started ? 
  i 'm defending innocent people who are being opressed because of shitheads who claim to act in their name . 
  you are trying to justify why an innocent person decides to join a radical terrorist organisation . 
  therefore , you are defending radicals . 
   what did you do about it ? 
  i certainly did n't attack the office of a news paper , i did n't attack a concert with my buddies armed to the teeth . 
  i did n't work my way towards killing people . 
   did you fight back to defend yourself ? 
  how is [ suicide bombing ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36880758 ) a way to defend yourself ? 
   given that most ruling class in the western world are christians , are christians are not opressed because of their religion in any way , probably not . 
   if we 're talking in islamic countries where they 're opressed and murdered , i 'd have a easier time seeing their point of view right . 
  so as long as a group of people is oppressed , they could be murdering those who oppress them , if it were up to you . 
  at what point , i wonder , does the oppressed become the oppressor ? 
  have you ever been insulted , bullied , targeted by either a group of people or an individual in a way it caused you discomfort ? 
  what did you do about it ? 
  did you think to yourself , `` perhaps i should work on a way to kill them or some other people , who share something in common with them ( like their religion or country ) , in the name of my god . '' ? 
  it appears they have . 
  stop defending radicals . 
  there 's no excuse for murder with intent to kill . 
  would you defend radical christians if they were putting people who insult them or their faith on crosses and pyres ? 
  would it not change your point of view , if ** they ** were committing terrorism in the same way * some * muslims do around the world ? 
   beer grapes we make wine out of grapes , you barbaric northerners . 
  probably grapes . 
   never seen anyone more toxic than you on reddit . 
  i deleted it all . 
  are you happy ? 
  no , this makes me very sad . 
  what i gathered from news like this , is this . 
  according to the left , whenever a person comments something you disagree with or offends you , or something you just ca n't comprehend , you can ignore their comment and call them trolls . 
   i 'm not gon na invest hours of time for some random reddit strangers . 
  i 'm sorry , i assumed you have commented because you wanted to share your thoughts on the matter . 
  it seems like you comment for the amusement of reddit strangers . 
  my bad . 
  can you not form your own opinion based on either the show , or the report ? 
  would you also cite wikipedia in a white paper for school ? 
   besides youtube is a good way to inform people in a quick way without reading a whole book .
