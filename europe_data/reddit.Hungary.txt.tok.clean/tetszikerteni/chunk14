  in my opinion , this was a right call . 
  there are several sources [ [ 1 ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/01/refugees-isis-nato-commander-terrorists ) ] [ [ 2 ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/german-intelligence-warns-of-is-hit-squads-among-refugees/ ) ] that claim there are isis fighters among genuine refugees . 
  do you know any other way of preventing them entering our countries , than strict border control ? 
   additionally , they do understand that they are generally accepted well , i can [ assure you ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37528325 ) they are not generally accepted here in hungary . 
  the vote turned out invalid , however considering the calls for boycott by the left , it still shows how the * majority of those who participate in referendums * think on this issue . 
   and before you say it - a chinatown style quarter in a city with overwhelmingly native population is not `` establishing your own commonwealth '' chinatown style quarter is not what i had in mind . 
  what i had , is groups of people setting up their [ own ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muslim_arbitration_tribunal ) [ court ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_sharia_council ) system inside another country , which are already [ causing ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sharia-courts-in-uk-face-government-probe-over-treatment-of-women-a7049826.html ) [ problems ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sharia_patrols ) . 
  this is absurd to me , and i can easily relate it to displacing natives , and taking power . 
   weapons ? 
  in the video you can see them throwing rocks at our police , i 'd consider them weapons . 
   actual , widespread violence ? 
  this is actual violence . 
  you can call it widespread if you look at all the violent crimes committed by migrants in the last couple of years . 
   pillaging and burning ?

  somebody is trying to overtake the power from the people of europe , by [ making us , europeans bend to their comfort ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/615984/refugee-crisis-syria-oberhausen-germany-protestant-church ) . 
  we must not upset them , and when they complain , we must do our best to comfort them . 
  when they upset us , we must not speak up about it , because we must not upset them . 
  this is not fair . 
   invasions , not migrations . 
  can you see a difference between [ ` the ** invasion ** of rome ' ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/cole_thomas_the_course_of_empire_destruction_1836.jpg ) and [ ` the ** migrating ** through r\u00f6szke ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dfwighfqpo ) ? 
  for me it is not as clear as it is for you . 
  could you explain the difference ? 
  i understand , still from your reasoning it seems to me you do n't understand their reasons . 
  people who are against the spread of islam in europe are against it because there is a subset of people who are self-proclaimed islamists and are causing problems ( violent crimes , terrorism ) . 
  the people in question do n't know yet what would be the best course of action to separate those who are bad from those who are not , so the only way they see preventing the problems possible , is being rude and excluding everyone who claims to be islamist , while we 're trying to figure out a vetting system for them . 
   preferred rock band if there were a subset of nickelback fans who are causing similar problems , would you let nickelback fans pouring into your country without going through regular border checks ? 
  how could you prevent the crimes of `` nickelback extremists '' without being rude with people who just `` happen to like nickelback '' ? 
   it 's irrational hate irrational for you , or the person who 's hating ? 
  i 'm going to demonstrate the debating style you decided to use in [ your other comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5j0iob/orban_2017_will_be_a_year_of_rebellion/dbczr0t/ ) . 
   well it hardly impacts the lives of any natives . 
  that is complete bullshit . 
   and it saves the lives of thousands of humans . 
  who cares ? 
  what gives you the right to decide which lives worth saving ? 
  i hope you will understand why i find your style of reasoning wrong . 
  i would like to ask your opinion on the matter . 
  would you prioritize helping those who got into your country without any decent background check ( and often committing crime when crossing borders ) over those who decided to stay in their countries ? 
  what do you think , how can a person who was convicted of violent crimes enter schengen and commit violent crimes again ? 
  how is saving his life worth more than the impact on the lives of natives ? 
  why do you think ? 
  how so ? 
  the numbers just show you the damage caused by communism . 
  i do n't know , we 'll see . 
  he could also try to make some cuts in one part of the military and increase the funding of some others . 
  it 's still obama 's government . 
  trump will start on january 20th 2017 . 
  b-b-but it did n't happen in m-my gated community , it 's irrelevant !, 
   it is absolutely impossible to have a political discussion with someone who x and it should never , ever be tolerated this is why people who disagree with you will vote for a party , person or ideology more extreme than previously every time you try to silence them . 
  it ** is ** possible to have a political discussion with anyone . 
  however it may not be possible to come to an agreement with them . 
  but that 's okay because we like democracy and everyone 's opinion must be heard , right ? 
   they are not criminals , they are just desperate people fleeing from war funny , i 've never been so desperate to start breaking laws . 
   award nuclear reactors to russian companies without a international tender . 
  this is n't the main issue regarding our nuclear plant deal with russia . 
  the problem is the secrecy around it . 
  `` you do n't get to properly document this piece of history , because we who have all the documentation of it believe it is inappropriate for you . '', 
  why do n't they let me decide ? 
  what sort of ethical problem could a few hundred years old letter cause ? 
  you are right about far right , we had some news on jobbik having ties to russia too . 
  i believe putin wants to help the far right in eu because the leftist eu right now is clearly anti russia . 
  also , far right parties tend to be anti eu more than anything , probably because of the desire for independence these parties share . 
  however , orb\u00e1n is pro eu and seems like pro russia at the same time . 
  unfortunately , if we look at a map , hungary has no choice . 
  we 're stuck between western europe and russia , and we 're smaller and weaker compared to either of them . 
  we have to get along with both of them . 
  sometimes this will be easy , sometimes it wo n't . 
  it seems to me orb\u00e1n is trying to maintain this balance , while also keeping independence in mind as our long term goal . 
   more often than not , these people who are so proud of their nation and desire independence are funded by russian money evidence ? 
   he flirts with nationalism a bit more than what i 'd prefer that 's another thing which usually bugs me . 
  nationalism , as definition means a group of people wants to achieve independence for their culture . 
  looking at hungarian history , this political ideology has roots here . 
  we fought against any outsider who tried to force their culture or ideology on us , and we 're fighting now as well . 
  we have a deeply rooted desire for independence , and self preservation . 
  what 's wrong with this ? 
  you say you have read his words . 
  how does he want to end democracy ? 
  they 've lost their 2/3rd majority in the parliament , they ca n't make changes to our constitution anymore , and they did n't destroy democracy while they could have . 
  what makes you think , he 's working on it slowly , one step a time ? 
  the left has lost it 's teeth over the years , everything they do is ineffective regardless of orb\u00e1n and his policies . 
  the only party who could challenge him is further-right jobbik , although if you ask me , they could use a charismatic leader , vona just does n't cut it for me . 
  you can listen to [ his speech ( with english subtitles ) from 2014 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vax-aanmlg8 ) when ( i believe ) he first talked about this ` illiberal democracy ' he 's trying to achieve , and in which he first relates his goals to turkey , russia , china . 
  you can read the script [ here ] ( http://www.kormany.hu/en/the-prime-minister/news/the-era-of-the-work-based-state-is-approaching ) from official government sources . 
  this is what he said regarding china , turkey , russia :  the prime minister declared that there is a global race to invent a state that is most suited to achieving the success of the nation . 
  today , the world is trying to understand systems that are not western , not liberal , perhaps not even democracies , but are nevertheless successful , and the `` stars '' of the analysts are singapore , china , india , russia and turkey , he said . 
   `` while breaking with the dogmas and ideologies that have been adopted by the west , we are trying to find the form of community organisation , the new hungarian state , which is capable of making our community competitive in the great global race for decades to come . '', 
   in reply to the question of what 's next following the nation state , the liberal state and the welfare state , mr. orb\u00e1n said that the hungarian solution is the approaching era of a work-based state . 
  now i understand it 's up to you , the individual thinker to decide which source do you want to believe . 
  do you want to believe the thousands of hungarians living in london who say they could n't make it at home ? 
  do you want to believe some journalists who have never stepped foot into our country , let alone speaking the language ? 
  do you want to believe those who lost in the previous elections and now they 're sad and hurt ? 
  or do you believe official government reports and the words of the democratically elected leader ? 
  all i 'm trying to say , it is not as clearly bad as it looks or as it is reported in foreign media . 
  yes , we have problems , we 're not saints , but we 're being framed for being the worst people in eu . 
  you do n't like what we 're doing ? 
  you leave . 
   well we could try what i suggested first and see if they get angry enough to leave . 
  or how about taking responsibility , declaring ideology being the first and most important basis of the alliance , and kicking out anyone who disagrees with it . 
   we can suspend poland 's voting rights and eu support ` we should take away the voting rights of over 40 million people because they do not believe in our cause ! ', 
   stop electing somebody who wants to undermine democracy , or get together and stop orban from doing so even after he got elected .
