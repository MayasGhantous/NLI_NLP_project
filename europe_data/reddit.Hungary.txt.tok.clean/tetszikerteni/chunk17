  i mean i do n't want to put down things i know nothing about , but , but , ... never mind . 
  that 's fine . 
  i have no idea about what those people do after they finish it either . 
  does n't seem as useful as anything in stem , economics and law . 
   i do n't quite understand why issuing foreign diplomas in a hungarian school ( or one physically present there ) would be an important matter me neither . 
  they 're learning [ generic stuff \\ ( as far as i 'm aware \\ ) ] ( https://www.ceu.edu/academics/degrees/masters ) , so in theory it should n't really matter . 
  the truth is , many people are considering leaving the country after they finish university , and i imagine it 's easier with a us diploma . 
   how hungarian gov ' t gets any say our current government likes to portray itself as the unstoppable hero of the people ( look at the heineken thing recently ) , who stands up against all evil ( soros is already established as a source of evil ) to protect any hungarian interest . 
  i believe all of this is for show . 
  by the time the eu gets there to actually do something against hungary , the law will be reverted , or the situation will be resolved somehow , making the punishment seem pointless . 
  this is a situation where people who supported orb\u00e1n before will still support him , and those who did n't are obviously outraged . 
  but this is just my opinion , do n't take it for a fact . 
  he 's setting up the game for our 2018 elections . 
  the left will be outraged , and while they ca n't agree on anything relevant , they will agree on topics which did n't even happen : budapest olympics , this case ( if ceu keeps working in budapest ) , and who knows what else orb\u00e1n will throw in until then . 
  it 's complicated . 
  first , the law requires every university 's foreign home country , to have an agreement on accreditation and such between them and hungary . 
  the law also says , if they are a federal country ( like the us ) , this requires a federal approach , instead of a state one . 
  the us law says it 's the state 's job to do it . 
  they obviously wo n't change their laws over this , and it seems the hungarian government wo n't either . 
  secondly , ceu awards us accredited diplomas , and for those who apply , hungarian ones too ( as far as i know ) . 
  i 've read this would not affect already ongoing courses , only new ones . 
  without the agreement , they would n't be able to award those foreign diplomas , which as they claim would weaken them . 
  also , i think this would require some of their foreign teachers to pursue a `` licence to teach in hungarian accredited courses '' or something along those lines , which they claim many would refuse and just leave , weakening the quality of the uni , which would weaken them more on the market . 
  the law itself does n't imply closure . 
   what exactly does this new law say  exactly you can read it [ here , in hungarian ] ( http://www.parlament.hu/irom40/14686/14686.pdf ) . 
  tl ; dr : a lot of people are mad , because currently there 's only one private university in hungary , which this law affects . 
  that one university is ceu , founded and financed by soros . 
  sorry , yet again i forgot i have to spell out everything for you . 
  my point is , if over 60 percent ( 3.3 / 4.9 ) of people who generally speaking `` can be arsed '' to vote , decide to vote in support of our government in a referendum , that is a significant political message . 
  besides , it was invalid only because every opposition party who has any kind of measurable support ( except jobbik ) , campaigned and promoted the idea of staying home , because they knew how it would turn out . 
  this way they intended to force their minority opinion on the majority of voters . 
   or are you saying this referendum should not be inconsequential and has any meaning at all , thereby opposing your country 's current constitution ? 
  my english is failing me here . 
  do you mean since the referendum was invalid , the fact that our government acted on it , their act violates our constitution ? 
  and your question is where do i stand on this . 
  correct ? 
  in this case it does n't , because a successful referendum is binding , an unsuccessful one does n't limit the government on anything . 
  it 's not a nice move to push through the law they could n't get accepted by a referendum , but it does n't violate our constitution . 
  as they say , they just `` happened to '' push through the same thing they would have voted on if the referendum was successful . 
  i think that referendum was intended to use in arguments against the eu ( which it is still good , since so many agreed on it ) , and it was a very expensive poll . 
  i 'm more disappointed in the opposition for not being able to form an argument on the subject , so they had to revert to a boycott . 
   there 's really no other interpretation other than a majority of hungarian voters could not be arsed to go to the polls to express their agreement with orban , so either a majority of voters does not agree with him or they do n't care considerably , which comes down to the same thing , since he styled it into a future-defining vote for the country . 
  on this invalid referendum , [ 3 362 224 people voted with `` no '' ] ( http://www.valasztas.hu/hu/ref2016/1154/1154_0_index.html ) , meaning they agreed with orb\u00e1n , and they made the trip to the voting booths . 
  on our last general elections , [ 4 918 934 people ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014-es_magyarorsz%c3%a1gi_orsz%c3%a1ggy%c5%b1l%c3%a9si_v%c3%a1laszt%c3%a1s ) `` could be arsed '' to do so . 
  if you think 3.3 million is not a significant amount of all people who care about politics enough to be bothered to vote , i ca n't help you . 
   no , you claimed explicitly that merkel said something and i asked you for a source because i know you made it up . 
  and now you do n't want to admit that . 
  you expect me to find a literal quote where merkel says `` we will take everybody in '' , which i will obviously not find , because things are not 100 % literal every single time , even if you wish they were , like in this comment section . 
  but no worries , i 'm willing to help out , i 'll walk you through some of the events that made me think what i said above , and i 'll even use some links to satisfy your thirst for source . 
  i 'm going to use parts of [ this article ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2015-09/angela-merkel-refugees-crisis-chancellor/seite-4 ) , and instead of linking it every time , i 'll just drop the link right here , in hopes it does n't get lost . 
  in the summer of 2015 ( and even before that ) , a lot of people [ from syria , afghanistan , iraq , and many african countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_migrant_crisis#/media/file:sea_arrivals_to_greece_and_italy_in_2015_by_nationality.png ) arrive to their first eu country , greece and italy . 
  since hungary was mostly by the refugees arriving in greece , i 'm going to focus on them , because those were the ones who arrived through hungary . 
  this was called the west balkan route , which [ as you can see ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/map_of_the_european_migrant_crisis_2015.png ) goes through greece , the balkan countries , and finally arrives at hungary 's southern border . 
  august 25 , 2015 : the german federal office for migration and refugees ( bundesamts f\u00fcr migration und fl\u00fcchtlinge - bamf ) [ sends out the following tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/bamf_dialog/status/636138495468285952 ) . 
  according to the customs of our current years , tweets made by official government institutions are commonly regarded as official statements . 
  the tweet roughly says , germany is no longer enforcing dublin procedures for syrian citizens . 
  this made many people [ throw away their own passports on the balkan route , and claim themselves syrian citizens ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/25/it-took-on-a-life-of-its-own-how-rogue-tweet-led-syrians-to-germany ) , who now that they have an official declaration of acceptance , refused to be processed by the authorities in hungary . 
  august 31 , 2015 : hungary ( and austria ) are already sending migrants on trains to germany , while merkel holds her summer press conference . 
  on this conference , amongst many things , they 're discussing the topic of said trains . 
  they reach the conclusion , that they can not send them back to hungary . 
  september 1 , 2015 : syrians , albanians and iraqis shout `` germany , germany ! '', 
  and `` merkel !, 
  merkel ! '', 
  at a train station in budapest . 
  when the chancellor sees this on television , she is touched . 
  september 3 , 2015 : hungary halts the trains , so the refugees continue their journey on foot . 
  they march alongside highways , on railway tracks , through meadows . 
  they march toward germany , to merkel . 
  september 5 , 2015 : merkel speaks by telephone with prime minister viktor orb\u00e1n of hungary and chancellor werner faymann of austria . 
  i hope you 're still reading , or reading the article itself , because this is the sentence you wanted to read . 
  orb\u00e1n says the situation is no longer under control . 
  merkel and faymann decide to allow the refugees to leave hungary . 
  late in the evening , merkel has georg streiter , her deputy spokesman , declare that germany will not turn the refugees away . 
  so orb\u00e1n , according to the german zeit.de admitted to merkel , that the situation in hungary is no longer under control , when migrants in budapest shouting ` germany , germany ' and demand to leave , and many more are coming , many of them illegally . 
  to get this situation under control , in a month hungary completed it 's border barrier on the border with serbia , and made some new laws to reduce the number of illegal entries . 
  this slowed down the inflow of refugees to a point where it was again under control . 
  the official statements and the words of merkel 's spokesman lead me to believe accepting everyone and anyone ( who claims to be syrian ) . 
   please , feel free to address any of that . 
  i hope i addressed all of that , if you feel any of them missing , tell me . 
   i see a lot of blustering from you , but no concrete responses to what i wrote . 
  fine , let 's have concrete responses to what you wrote . 
   without germany and austria , there would have been thousands dead on the streets of budapest and hungary as a whole . 
  prove your claims please , preferably with sources . 
   orban , again , bussed masses of people to the austrian border ** without ** warning or ** coordinating with austrian authorities ** prove it please . 
   his party was not elected by a majority which means absolutely nothing . 
  almost nobody is elected by the majority , but i 'm willing to go through a few elections in recent past . 
  [ 2013 german federal election results . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_federal_election,_2013#results ) cdu and csu achieved 42 % of the votes , which is less than 50 % , meaning , they are not supported by the majority of people . 
  [ 2015 uk general election results . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_general_election,_2015#results ) the conservatives achieved 36.8 % of votes , meaning they are not supported by the majority of people . 
  [ 2016 usa election results . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_presidential_election,_2016 ) the republicans achieved 46.1 % of votes , meaning they are not supported by the majority of people . 
  what does this mean ? 
  it simply means , elections are not always decided by the popular vote . 
  does this make them illegitimate or undemocratic ? 
  no , of course not . 
   referendum where orb\u00e1n lost by not even getting enough voters to care enough to come out to vote for it to be valid , despite there being no noteworthy opposition campaign . 
  despite , his major oppositions ( except jobbik ) asking for absence , knowing full well that for the loaded question , the only acceptable answer was `` no '' , which orb\u00e1n supported . 
  here 's [ mszp asking for absence ] ( http://mszp.hu/hir/harom_ok_amiert_csalasra_szamitunk_oktober_2-an ) , ( article on official site , in hungarian ) .
