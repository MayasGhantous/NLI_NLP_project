  here 's a [ facebook video of gyurcsany ] ( http://mandiner.hu/cikk/20161002_gyurcsany_maradj_otthon ) , the leader of dk begging for you to `` stay at home , stay in europe '' . 
  there were some , like mkkp ( who has zero in the poll i linked above ) who campaigned to vote invalid . 
  [ read more about all the campaigns here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_migrant_quota_referendum,_2016#campaign ) . 
  i hope i addressed everything , if not , again , please point it out , i will get to it sometime . 
   i think you missed that i was talking about before he closed the borders . 
  i do n't think i have . 
  he started his propaganda campaign against refugees before he put the fence up . 
  ( i have to point out , the fence only protects the green border , the border itself is n't closed , you can cross the border legally at regular crossings . ), 
   there would have been thousands dead on the streets of budapest and hungary as a whole dead ? 
  how , by starvation ? 
  give me a break [ ( 1 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny9hyv3znga ) [ \\ ( 2 \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn3gy-y1xuy ) . 
  we had designated areas ( open camps ) where we provided everyone who applied for asylum with medical care , food and shelter . 
  those people who decided to stay on the streets of budapest , did so on their own accord , knowing ( or should have been knowing ) authorities who could provide these to them wo n't be able to go to them . 
   ca you please provide me a source for that claim ? 
  when did she say that ? 
  i meant he started to openly criticize merkel after ( one of ? ), 
  her `` we can do this '' speech . 
   how is it relevant anyway when his mistakes i addressed predate any action by the german government ? 
  you are on point . 
  he acted before any action by the german government . 
  some of these were mistakes according to you , but nobody in hungary ( his target audience ) will ever remember those . 
  they only remember `` thanks to orb\u00e1n , we have no immigrant problem '' . 
  this will keep him elected , and that 's all he cares about . 
   does not have majority support in the polls , what polls ? 
  you mean [ party preference in 2017 february , where they have the most with 33 percent , and the next party has 10 ] ( http://kozvelemenykutatok.hu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sz%c3%a1zadv%c3%a9g_febru%c3%a1r-1.jpg ) ? 
  perhaps you mean [ the referendum , where only 41,32 % of all voters participated , and resulted in 98,36 % in favour of orb\u00e1n 's anti-immigrant message ] ( http://www.valasztas.hu/hu/ref2016/1154/1154_0_index.html ) ? 
   and only won a majority of seats because of new and arguably undemocratic election laws they did some gerrymandering , and established a first past the post system , which they often defend with the claim that `` it 's similar to what they have in the uk '' . 
  i 'm not trying to defend them in general , i only think they did well in this migration crisis . 
   failure to react or plan in any way he was the only politician in europe who reacted in any way , other than letting everyone in . 
  he started to influence public opinion to his advantage , pushed through new laws regarding illegal border crossings , and got rid of everyone who came in illegally , in the way the strongest eu leader requested . 
  we threw them over the border to austria , so they could reach merkel . 
   blamed merkel ? 
  he blames merkel since she said they can take anyone and everyone . 
   you thought that train wreck of governmental inability , begging and two-facedness was ` handling ' anything , and well at that ? 
  the people who elect him are contented with the way he handled it . 
  at this * moment * , there are no alternatives , so do n't hold your breath . 
   still awaiting the day that anyone proposes solutions that actually solve problems rather than pandering to their electorate . 
  depends on what do you define as problems , and which of those you want to solve . 
  there were some , from the very beginning , who were [ suggesting offshore migrant centers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2hfq4cm_3e ) , to reduce the number of economic migrants disguising themselves as refugees . 
  this is commonly ignored by people who cry out for more refugees . 
  if we spend our resources on people who simply want a better place to live in , we are effectively taking that away from actual refugees , who are trying to escape racial or religious , prosecution . 
  if you only care about absorbing all people who are coming , nobody will have a solution for you . 
   why the fuck is hungary still in the eu ? 
  because we do n't break eu laws and regulations which could result in such punishment . 
  kicking us out for the things we 've been doing for the past 7 years would weaken the union more , than keeping us in . 
  this way , every politician in western eu can point at us , `` look , they are the real evil politicians , not me , keep voting , pleb ! '', 
  you should look at your own comments more often then . 
   and yet there are over a billion of them who are n't doing anything . 
      so apparently your `` because of islam '' is bullshit . 
  and yet there are over a billion of people who are n't dying of hunger . 
  so apparently `` world hunger '' is bulllshit . 
  see the problem with your argument ? 
   maybe it 's better to lock everyone up until their claim is processed . 
  but it is n't legal according to international and eu law . 
  they 're not actually locked up . 
  they 're restricted in their movement in hungary , but they can leave the country whenever they wish , if they do n't want to wait until the process is done . 
  orb\u00e1n has said many times , he 's not against eu , so we probably wo n't leave . 
  you would have to throw us out . 
  do you really think an internal fight like that would help the current integrity of the union ? 
  i do n't think the eu wants a martyr , and orb\u00e1n 's crimes against the union are insignificant so far . 
  he 's just a little uncomfortable thorn . 
  it would definitely make him stronger . 
  he was trained to be the david against the goliath that was russia around 1989 . 
  it will be a political home turf for him when the eu goes all out against him . 
   survival and `` being able to afford stuff '' is n't a profession , it 's stupid to even make that comparison . 
  how do you think people stay poor through generations ? 
  if you can educate yourself to be better than your parents , and if you make better life choices than them ( which you should , given their example and your education ) , you will have better chances at survival , than they had . 
  right now , i do n't think this is possible for a lot of people , therefore they stay unskilled and poor . 
  this is why i believe a better education system could fix the problem , while throwing tax money at the problem would only provide treatment for the symptoms . 
   everyone became rich by making sure that others did n't become rich as well , since if everyone else was rich then they would n't be how does the person who invents new medicine make anyone poor ( er ) ? 
  how does the person who creates new software out of thin air make anyone poor ( er ) ? 
  how does a hollywood actor make anyone poor ( er ) ? 
  how does a sportsman make anyone poor ( er ) ? 
  how does a fancy restaurant owner make anyone poor ( er ) ? 
  if you have a trade , which is desired , and you 're good at it , you will have no problem . 
  if you 're not good at it , either work on getting better , or find something else . 
  if you do n't have any expertise , you should start working on bettering yourself , instead of expecting the government to `` level the playing field '' in your favour . 
  why do you think they 're the same problem ? 
  not everyone is rich because somebody ( everyone ?? ), 
  else is poor . 
  he 's a crook , but he did n't become rich by making you or your parents poor . 
  do you think this applies to every profession ? 
  i 'm going back to sports , and namely hossz\u00fa , because her profession directly involves performance . 
  do you think she 's winning because she has some sort of privilege over others ? 
  should we help others with doping to be closer to her in the end ? 
  should we limit her abilities somehow , to make the results even ? 
  so which one is the bigger problem ? 
  somebody having an easier time , or someone else having it harder ? 
  i do n't mind going back to their better families . 
   imagine this yes !, 
  you have no idea how much ( i assume involuntary ) joy you just caused me by comparing income tax to thievery . 
  thank you . 
   so you take 500k  taking 5000 from that guy you get a bigger punishment for stealing 500k than stealing 5000 . 
  should thieves get the same punishment without any regards to the amount they stole ? 
  surely no , then why is it okay if the government does it ? 
   the state has an obligation to better the livelihood of all its citizens and to maximize/optimize those efforts . 
  this is where we disagree , actually . 
  i believe the state only has an obligation to create an equal environment for competing , but should not interfere with the competition itself . 
   we do need to try to find a way to get to where the norwegians already are if only we found oil before joining the eu . 
  i have a theory , if everyone had a similar background during our early school years , we all would end up as the same in terms of quality of life .
