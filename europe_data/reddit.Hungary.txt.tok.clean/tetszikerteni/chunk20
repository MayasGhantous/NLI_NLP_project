  however , if we 're talking about hungary as a location , we use the above form . 
  we stick an * - i * ( sometimes * - beli * ) to the end , and use lowercase . 
   instead of preparing for the shit-storm politicians sat around thinking - how can we put a spin on this and push our agenda rather than really protecting our people . 
  how can you prepare , or protect our people better , than restricting entry ? 
  the fence prevents anyone walking through , now you ca n't skip the border checks . 
  the problem is , nobody figured anything better out so far . 
   they pose risk because governments want them to pose risk so politicians can pedal forward through murky waters of lies and propaganda pinning innocent people against innocent people . 
  they pose a risk , because in their culture , it is acceptable to stone a woman who was raped , to death , and [ they have proved to keep their radicalism ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/11/british-muslims-strong-sense-of-belonging-poll-homosexuality-sharia-law ) even after a couple of generations in western europe . 
   here 's the right-wing nationalist agenda : great-hungary i 've never heard him openly speak about restoring our borders , only jobbik is thinking along the lines of that . 
   people who gained citizenship through naturalization will never be considered hungarians the same way as someone born in hungary . 
  they are , according to our laws , and i ca n't get you a poll on this , but i 'm sure the majority considers them hungarians . 
   do n't kid yourself thinking that they 'll vote for him [ i do n't . 
  ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014-es_magyarorsz%c3%a1gi_orsz%c3%a1ggy%c5%b1l%c3%a9si_v%c3%a1laszt%c3%a1s#eredm.c3.a9nyek ) pay attention to those who voted in mail . 
   they do n't refuse to speak the native language , they ca n't speak the native language . 
  so , how exactly are they not qualify as hungarians in the eyes of hungarians ? 
  their * native * language ** is ** hungarian . 
  their country 's official language is n't . 
   dude , the numbers of christians are not declining because of refugees or muslims , they 're declining because because of many reasons . 
  however , they 're still over 50 % of our population , and when orb\u00e1n promises them to protect their majority , it obviously earns him their support . 
   making you re-evaluate your options about having a family or raising a family in a religious environment there are n't any side effects of christianity that i can recall , that would affect our day-to-day lives , currently in hungary . 
  we are not some country ruled by a terrorizing religious fanatic , like those islamic countries . 
   they are robbing you of your own wealth , not refugees or immigrants , and then go around fear-mongering feeding you lies about how the muslims are taking over . 
  our history is about being run over by islam , from the south . 
  how do you expect the average hungarian to react when he sees [ hordes of men marching in ? 
  ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/01ab/production/_85372400_3uj7e9qu.jpg )  it 's insane to me to grab at something so irrelevant as religion it 's not irrelevant when these people use their religion as state law . 
   as a reason to not let people who need our help into the country how do you propose help them ? 
  we ca n't give enough money to our state run hospital 's doctors and nurses , they all leave to germany . 
  we ca n't provide our pensioners with enough medical support , we ca n't pay our teachers in schools , we do n't have jobs to hire our own . 
  what could we give to people , who do n't speak our language , do n't share anything common with us ? 
   you 're giving him way more latitude than he deserves . 
  just because he has a law degree does n't mean that he 's a credible authority . 
  it just means he has a law degree . 
  i do n't say he 's credible , i say he is clever , smarter than all of his challengers in hungary , especially in legal issues , because he 's a lawyer . 
   is n't orban pushing for the change in constitution where marriage will be defined as a union of one man and one woman ? 
  yes he is , but if i remember correctly , he was more on the `` family = marriage between man and woman '' line , he wanted to define family as the marriage between man and woman . 
   orban said that muslim migrants from the middle east and north africa will pose a security risk for the mainly christian hungary . 
  what freaking security risk ? 
  is n't this pushing the christian agenda ? 
  keep in mind , orb\u00e1n is a law graduate . 
  he watches his words always . 
  he 's too good at this . 
  he 's right when he says muslim migrants pose a threat to hungary , which happens to be mainly christian . 
  [ isis has been found ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/r-german-spy-agency-says-isis-sending-fighters-disguised-as-refugees-2016-2 ) using the migration to get extremists into europe . 
  they are a threat . 
  not every migrant , not every refugee , but some are . 
  also , orb\u00e1n pushing the `` christian agenda '' is the same as i 've said in my previous comment . 
  he 's doing it , because half of the country is christian . 
  the other half includes people who simply do n't care , people who are strongly anti religion , and every other religion . 
  he supports the biggest group . 
  always . 
   why is he handing out citizenship like they 're candy from a pinata to hungarian minorities in croatia , slovenia and serbia ? 
  because they ** are ** hungarian , and he realised the stupid mistake made by his predecessor , who handled the situation of hungarians living in the territories of great-hungary . 
  this granted him around 100,000 votes for nothing . 
  these people will always vote for orb\u00e1n , because `` he gave us the right to be hungarian again '' . 
  keep in mind , there are still areas in these countries , where everyone speaks hungarian , some even refuse to speak their country 's official language . 
   look , i seriously do n't want to start a conflict here . 
  me neither . 
  he is a worm , we agree , but i do n't agree with your reasoning . 
   edit : one last thing , remember what happened with the referendum ? 
  he 's not a lawful or honest person . 
  he declared themselves winner , because everyone ( above 90 % ) of participants , voted in favor of their point . 
  it was invalid as a referendum , because the opposition campaigned `` stay at home '' , because they dared not to see themselves losers of yet another popularity contest . 
   hungarian christians are in danger their numbers are declining . .  small nation complex we are n't exactly huge with all the 10 million hungarians we have in the area . 
  come on , at least give me proofs to hate orb\u00e1n . 
  i already dislike him , but i wish to be able to argue against him , every now and then . 
  how will i ever hate him , if i ca n't find anything on him being racist and homophobic ? 
   hungary i 'll gladly go through your points . 
   fidesz is the ruling party and they 're as right wing as they come . 
  fidesz is not a right wing party . 
  they are more to the right compared to our socialist party mszp , but that does not make put them on the right . 
  i 'm not even sure if they can be categorised . 
  they always go with the wind in issues . 
  sometimes they make socialists blush with their policies , and sometimes they entertain right wing nationalists with their anti immigration stances . 
  they do this to stay in power . 
  they never upset the majority in any issue , this is their trick . 
   it gave us do you actually live here ? 
   super nationalist , racist , homophobic , xenophobic pm , vikor orban nice buzzwords . 
  how is he racist ? 
  show me a quote or policy by orb\u00e1n , which makes him racist . 
  how is he homophobic ? 
  show me proof , i want to hate him too !, 
  the same goes for xenophobic too . 
  give me anything other than `` he is xenophobic , because he built a fence to keep ` refugees ' out '' . 
  the fence was built , because he had to draw the strength out of actual far-right jobbik . 
  all the fence does , is it keeps entering into the country under control . 
  if fidesz did n't do anything about the migrant crisis , jobbik would 've had a stroll in the next election . 
   the refugee crisis in the past two years has given them a surge in popularity nation wide . 
  some of the awful treatment of refugees has been well documented and reported globally , but this is what 's happening locally http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38881349 would it be better if jobbik a.k.a `` let 's keep a tab on jews in the parliament '' got more power because of it ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  btw , toroczkai is a unique joke , i would n't waste my breath on him . 
  other quote from the article :  one resident , eniko undreiner , said it was `` really scary '' to see `` masses of migrants walking through the village '' last year as they crossed into the country . 
  let 's not forget , we are the country , who banned far-right marches ( magyar g\u00e1rda ) too , because they were frightening . 
  it was banned by fidesz . 
  to answer op 's question : our far right is represented by jobbik , they have 23 seats out of 199 in the parliament , making them the third biggest political force , behind the leftist conglomerate ( 38 ) , and fidesz ( 133 ) . 
   are these people literally sitting on their asses all day ? 
  or are they doing the bare minimum to survive and then go do whatever they like ? 
  [ dunno , you tell me . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpe4a3keno8 ) back in the day during communism , they might enjoyed selling the radiators and the wooden floor from their government provided houses for their government provided work in the mines , as scrap metal and firewood , but i 'm not sure . 
  that could also be the things they like to do . 
  i honestly do n't know .
