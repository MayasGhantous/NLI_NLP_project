  the students ? 
  who exactly ? 
  ceu is a privately founded institution , which is right now criticising a policy , which was clearly aimed at them , to make their life more difficult . 
  they have every right to criticise the policy and the government for this . 
   it does have a reputation of being a pain in the ass for wannabe autocrats , who ca n't handle criticism . 
  can you show me the history of ceu ( rector ? 
  dean ? 
  student ? 
  owner ? 
  whoever ? ), 
  `` being a pain in the ass for wannabe autocrats , who ca n't handle criticism '' ? 
   universities do n't have to be politically neutral . 
  how does an institution like a university develop a political opinion as a whole ? 
  the teachers may have their own personal opinion , but in my opinion that should not have a place in lectures . 
  think about how does the political opinion of different academic studies affect each profession . 
  does the politics of a medical student matter , when they become a surgeon ? 
  does it matter for a physicist in research ? 
  does it matter for an engineer ? 
  does it matter for a historian ? 
  does it matter for a gender-studies major ? 
  does it matter for a political scientists ? 
  in my opinion , it does n't matter in either of these , and frankly i ca n't think of a single profession , where it would be beneficial to influence the person studying with politics . 
   and universities are n't supposed to teach government-friendly . 
  they are n't supposed to teach anti-government either . 
  generally speaking , political opinion should be something everyone develops individually , not something you are taught , just like religion , favourite football club or taste in food . 
   if it 's teaching plain , neutral , useful stuff oh they do !, 
  you will find a list of their masters [ here ] ( https://www.ceu.edu/academics/degrees/masters ) !, 
  as if they 're not from some hot desert but the tundra . 
  well , i do n't know how you established agenda pushing , i only checked the first page of op 's submitted posts , and i ca n't see any signs of clear agenda pushing . 
  i also do n't agree on the unreliable part , it 's a video compilation of protesters answering questions , mostly regarding their protest . 
  how can that be unreliable ? 
   the `` are you against democracy '' question is loaded . 
  surely it is . 
  i believe in a healthy debate , ( where both sides has an argument instead of trying to mindlessly throw empty phrases to each other ) , he would have been called out on it . 
  unfortunately , these did n't seem like healthy debates to me . 
  sidenote : this agenda pushing is such a low effort reasoning to ban or remove posts . 
  basically anyone who ever got very interested in a political opinion ( for example remain or leave ) is bound to be found ` guilty ' of ` persistently and overwhelmingly ' posting comments to promote their opinion . 
  i hope this is not a frequently used reason to remove posts or to ban people . 
   edit : also reported . 
  may i inquire , with what reasoning ? 
  using events they 've been supported for for their political agenda . 
  they 've been against all forms of crime including terrorism . 
  you ca n't blame the deaths on them . 
  yeah , only the far right . 
  it 's such a unique political tool of the right , we have n't seen the exact same tactics from anyone else in politics . 
  so no problem then . 
  carry on . 
  [ this could be relevant . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rgwks2uawy ), 
  i believe asylum applicants will be housed in them , ( perhaps ) even until they 're accepted into a country . 
  i do n't know how this will work out though . 
  most of them do n't want to stay in hungary , because [ `` there is no work , the language is very strange , and they 're not helping refugees '' . ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/reporters-notebook/migrants/hungary-treatment-refugees ) . 
  will they be granted free movement in the schengen area ? 
   instead of integrating them into society when we let them in , [ they did n't want to integrate to our hungarian society , they wanted germoney ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/sep/01/migrants-stranded-in-hungary-train-station-chant-germany-germany-video ) . 
  what can we do ? 
   pretty sure the hungarian version will be far worse than in other countries . 
  the country is a xenophobic shithole and should get kicked out of the eu . 
  they could n't be further from `` western values '' , it 's a backwards far right wing culture that should n't have a place in western europe . 
      if we allow hungary in the eu then we might just let in all the islamist too because ultimately it 's all just poor people with backwards cultures . 
  not an argument . 
  if they do n't want to wait for the results of their asylum application , they can leave towards serbia ( where they came from ) . 
  however they are limited in their movement in hungary while their application is being processed . 
  this way , people who would be denied entry are n't allowed free movement in the schengen area . 
  we only let in people we know of . 
   if the hungarians can see the clearly biased borderline `` shitposting '' that goes on about their country in the western media , it 's not hard for the ruling party to make sort of an `` enemy '' out of the west . 
  it 's weird how few people can actually see this . 
   its not a bad solution if they use the right contractors and government oversight . 
  not using the best contractors for whatever reasons ( corruption for example ) , and a lack of oversight could be a legit criticism towards orb\u00e1n and his party . 
   however orbans people arent exactly known for giving a shit about refugees ' welfare or human rights . 
  this is a baseless accusation . 
  the way the media usually depicts it : [ pic ] ( https://internationalcriminallaw.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/human-smuggling-victims-intercepted.jpg ) what this really means : [ france ] ( http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20160111&amp;t=2&amp;i=1108713286&amp;w=&amp;fh=545px&amp;fw=&amp;ll=&amp;pl=&amp;sq=&amp;r=lynxnpec0a12x ) , [ germany ] ( http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150908151945-germany-berlin-inside-refugee-shelters-shubert-pkg-00004102-large-169.jpg ) , [ turkey ] ( https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/16/magazine/16kilis1/16kilis1-superjumbo.jpg ) . 
    hungary is pressing ahead with the construction of two container camps for asylum seekers on its border with serbia , despite international criticism . 
  despite international criticism ? 
  how else would the bbc suggest to house these people ** temporarily ** ? 
   to honor their great soviet liberators which ones do you mean ? 
   back 40 years ago , `` independent hungary '' got invaded by russians simply for the wrong reforms . 
  what are you talking about ? 
   he is incredibly still a member of the european people 's party which party do you think would fit him better ? 
  or ( if that was n't your point ) why would you expect epp to throw him out ? 
  we were cunts , so we had it coming i guess . 
  shame about the timing though . 
  i guess someone somewhere in the past translated `` nemzeti \u00fcnnep '' to `` national day '' instead of the more literal `` national holiday '' . 
  one that happened before your country existed , , 
   hungary celebrates national day to be precise , we 're having a national holiday , celebrating the 1848 revolution . 
  fantastic article . 
   the mass detention of asylum seekers , including children , in guarded camps enclosed with razor wire [ actually ] ( http://new3.fjcdn.com/comments/for+you+_97b2c8495c0b1a4c491e3fda235808ce.jpg ) , according to [ our pm orb\u00e1n ] ( http://www.delmagyar.hu/belfold_hirek/orban_viktor_a_migransok_orizetbe_vetele_nem_egyenlo_a_fogva_tartassal/2510561/ ) , if they no longer have the desire to wait around until we process their application for asylum , they can leave towards serbia ( where they came ) . 
  they are only restricted in their movement in hungary before they 're allowed in . 
  he also said when he talked about this with the leaders of eu member states , they did n't complain about our new regulations , because this new law corresponds with the proposals of austria and germany . 
  this `` detention '' just makes sure no migrant can enter the eu from hungary , who we do n't know of . 
   clearly , mr. orban is playing the european union for a patsy . 
  at what point will the union have the courage to take action against his policies ? 
  oh , no , whatever will the union do against a member country 's democratically elected leader ? 
  i hope anyone who supports the idea of hungary being sanctioned realises it would only sanction it 's people , not it 's leader . 
  which would lead me to a better question : for how much is it ethical of the union to interfere with ( put pressure on ) the political leadership of a member state ? 
   in the summer of 2015 , it built a razor-wire fence along its southern border with serbia , and directed its border patrol to kick as many people as possible back to the other side . 
  hahaha . 
  how cruel of hungary . 
  a fence along the green border , to limit illegal entries , and a border patrol which [ upholds the law ] ( http://www.police.hu/english/border-information/border-crossing ) . 
   on wednesday , doctors without borders said said . 
  not much evidence has been provided however .
