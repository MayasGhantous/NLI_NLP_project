  they shared pictures of [ the tiniest bruises ] ( https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/sites/usa/files/styles/wysiwyg_full_width/https/media.msf.org/docs/msf/media/tr1/1/5/5/8/msf185786.jpg ) you could have . 
  you can get worse by tripping in your own feet . 
   as if all this were n't bad enough , hungary is recruiting and training a new cadre of `` border hunters , '' citizens who will be armed with pistols , batons , pepper spray and handcuffs and given the mission of beating refugees back from the country 's border . 
  how ridiculous is it to call them citizens after being admitted by the hungarian police , and 6 months of training . 
  [ after training , they will become `` co-patrols '' to our border patrols . 
  after another 12 months , they will join the reserves \\ ( `` stand by police '' = k\u00e9szenl\u00e9ti rend\u0151rs\u00e9g \\ ) . 
   we are debating whether it was an attack or a failed coup . 
  we are not debating , you use personal attacks to generate a reaction out of me , and you nit-pick words of my posts in order to keep the comments flow , while you ignore every material i provide for you . 
  this is not a debate , nor an argument . 
  it was a revolution , because the government got replaced , and it was done by the masses other than a few individuals . 
  you claim it was n't a revolution , ignoring internationally accepted historical evidences i provided , collected in [ this wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956 ) . 
   but you decided not to protest , when i 've never said we 're perfect , what 's your point ? 
   i guess `` free speech '' is a rather vague concept for you . 
  i 'll admit that this is an assumption . 
  in your case a justified one nevertheless ;-) again , you use personal attacks to shift the discussion in the way you want it to go . 
  why do n't you just go ahead and lecture me about what i 'm thinking , what country i 'm living in and what should we do , without personal attacks ? 
   you assume , that they receive huge amounts of money they get the most in germany , from that i deduct  they 're going to germany , instead of the czech republic , denmark , spain or whatever . 
   there has been a statue for decades now and nobody in hungary obviously had the idea to take it away . 
  quite a unique thing to have a monument for the dead , right ? 
  ever heard about this one ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_war_memorial_ ( treptower_park ) this has been there for decades now and nobody in germany obviously had the idea to take it away . 
  this , according to your deduction , confirms germany is still friends with russia . 
   you were protesting some internet tax . 
  we were protesting an internet tax , which could have set a bad precedent , and an easy way for our government to limit free speech , by raising taxes , limiting the amount of people who could get access to the internet . 
  this would have affected everyone in the country , who uses the internet . 
  we did n't protest in the same number ( or perhaps it just did n't make the headlines around there ) that there 's something with offensive text in a cemetery . 
   of this statue do you even know how it looks like ? 
   instead of staying there and keep fighting they decided to run away . 
  like [ all those healthy young man who were throwing rocks at our trains and the workers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lehbv6o71we ) , but did n't stay around in their war ridden country to fight for it ? 
   you did n't . 
  you linked some strange propaganda . 
  i 've left 3 links in my comment . 
  the first one lead you to the flickr page of unhcr , where you can see a picture of the austrian refugee camps in 1956 . 
  here 's the link again . 
  scroll down for description . 
  https://www.flickr.com/photos/unhcrce/5237643972/in/album-72157625415060585/ the second link was meant to help you find other pictures about the topic . 
  here it is : http://lmgtfy.com/?t=i&amp;iie=1&amp;q=1956+austria+refugee+camps the third one lead you to the wikipedia page of the 1956 hungarian revolution . 
  here it is again : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956#soviet_intervention_of_4_november which one of these do you consider strange propaganda ? 
   are russia and hungary friends ? 
  yes or no ? 
  right now our government seems to be supporting russia , so yes . 
   are orb\u00e1n and putin good friends ? 
  yes or no ? 
  i can only assume , which i 'd rather not . 
  you seem to be more comfortable with assumptions , so i 'll let you have them . 
  realistically they both are trying to use the other for their own reasons . 
   who is not answering questions here ? 
  you still did n't answer why are you personally attack me instead of staying on the topic , so it is you again . 
   if they are such good friends , that putin even gets invited to unveil a memorial not to unveil , that has been there for quite some time . 
   there was no attack !, 
  if there ever were an attack , putin would n't have been invited to hungary . 
  again , you create your own hypothesis , and you 're trying to construct your own argument based on that . 
   you are lying again . 
  you ignore all my questions and just lie . 
  no , i am not lying , i 'm citing history for you , which you choose to ignore . 
  i 'm also answering your questions , but if you only throw the same questions back at me without answering them yourself , i 'm going to keep calling you out for it . 
   you 're still obsessing about those `` soviet '' tanks ? 
  what 's your problem ? 
  you 're bringing up the topic , and when i ask questions , you refuse to answer them . 
   i understand that life is hard for you right now . 
  the correct word instead of `` understand '' is `` assume '' . 
   my lonely friend from hu . 
  again , assumptions about me , rather than addressing my points . 
   what attack ? 
  i linked you material on it . 
  read it . 
   why should i believe you ? 
  you should believe history . 
  but i remember , you prefer headlines . 
  here , do n't read whole articles or history books , go with this : http://clevelandhungarianmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1956-pa.jpg, 
   try to leave your basement now and then . 
  talk with some refugees . 
  oh wait , you ca n't . 
  they 're actually in real camps , not like the ones you were talking about , when those `` soviets '' `` attacked '' your `` country '' . 
  you are still on about this , and you call me obsessed . 
  why did n't you just save your breath and google it ? 
  here , let me help you : https://www.flickr.com/photos/unhcrce/5237643972/in/album-72157625415060585/ for more pictures , follow [ this link ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?t=i&amp;iie=1&amp;q=1956+austria+refugee+camps ) . 
   when those `` soviets '' `` attacked '' your `` country '' . 
  why the quotation marks ? 
  do you not believe it were the soviets who rolled in with tanks ? 
  do you not believe it was an attack ? 
  do you not believe hungary was a country back then ? 
  read up about it [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956#soviet_intervention_of_4_november ) . 
  what 's your problem ? 
  i 'm trying to be helpful , but you ignore everything i say and revert to personal attacks . 
  why ? 
  no , something more empty does . 
  i 'm simply replying to my inbox . 
  no need to worry . 
  i 'm looking at your posts you are leaving to mine . 
  that 's hardly an obsession . 
  i 'm not projecting , i 'm looking at your posts , and i can see the results . 
  i do n't need to project anything , because with every reply you prove me right . 
  what is your obsession ? 
   projecting much ? 
  you did ignore it , did n't you ? 
   why are you so mad now ? 
  i 'm not , you 're assuming things again . 
   and you admitted , that i actually was better at it than you . 
  you told me that i am some kind of superhuman .
