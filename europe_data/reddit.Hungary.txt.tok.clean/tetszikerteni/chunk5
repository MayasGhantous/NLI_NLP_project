  it 's there . 
  do i have to spell out sarcasm for you ? 
   are you hungarians always like this ? 
  [ ... ] we europeans never can do it right for you , ca n't we ... 
  i ask again even though i know you will ignore it , like you did before . 
  what is your obsession with hungary ? 
   i 'm adapting to the way you do this . 
  i was attacking your pathetic attempt at an argument , not you . 
   political prosecution from the soviets . 
  the hungarians did prosecute them themselves . 
  stop dragging in the russians in this . 
  you like deferring your problems on outsiders , do n't you ? 
  did hungarians invade our country in 1956 ? 
  those were soviets . 
  the political prosecution was committed after that by their loyalists , which i consider soviets too . 
  i guess i could call them communists , makes little difference . 
   it does n't have to . 
  but it sure as hell can . 
  sure it can , but why ** should ** it ? 
   not like hungary . 
   you mean the motto of hungary ? 
   you mean the hungarian way ? 
  what 's your obsession ? 
  i do n't understand why are you trying to shift the argument against me , after admitting your idea would n't work . 
  this is not an argument anymore . 
   no camp making stuff up again , i see . 
  i do n't say they did n't handle it better , but to claim there have been no camps , while i can prove you wrong with 1 google image search , makes you a fool . 
   also no war for years in hungary , no need to cross half the world . 
  no , no war . 
  fear of political prosecution by the occupying soviets for who knows how long does not seem bad at all , you are right . 
  from austria , they were transported later , when their turn came to countries such as usa , australia , canada , and all over europe . 
  all i 'm asking is ( which you conveniently ignore every time ) is why does the eu have to ** treat ** this crisis on it 's own ? 
  treat , because accepting everyone will not solve the crisis itself in syria . 
   you reply by talking out of your ass  no camp and i 'm talking out of my ass ? 
   skill only seems to be arrogance , if you look at it from below . 
  thanks for the compliment ;-) you mean your skill of imagining a best case scenario and building a belief system on top of it ? 
  or your skill of projecting your hatred against orb\u00e1n to me and everything that 's happening in our country ? 
  or your ability to judge a country and it 's people based on headlines ? 
  sure , i 'll gladly stay down on earth , you supreme being . 
  in camps in austria , where the austrians treeted them like animals ... oh wait . 
  right . 
  did n't happen . 
  you do realise austria is our neighbour , right ? 
  that 's why our people had to wait there . 
  it 's simple , you should be able to understand it . 
  syrians ( and many others ) want to go straight into germany . 
  why should hungary help them in this ? 
   yeah , try being funny i 'm not trying to be funny , you are making too many assumptions . 
   enjoy your life on the periphery . 
  and enjoy your refugees . 
  but you 've said we do n't allow anyone in , how could we enjoy refugees , when we do n't have any ? 
    your way does n't either . 
  so what now ? 
  thank you for finally admitting it . 
  `` my '' method would work , if every eu country wanted to do it . 
   stop harassing the rest of the eu , when it tries to do it in a cooperative manner through frontex why does the eu have to solve this crisis on it 's own ? 
  why do n't we ask saudi arabia to help ? 
  they 're closer , they have sources too . 
  why is this strictly an eu problem ? 
  we ca n't be expected to take care of the whole world . 
   so wait , you realise all of that , but you still keep defending him . 
  i 'm defending his way of handling this situation . 
  not him . 
   it is n't supposed to . 
  it 's for my entertainment . 
  i do n't like you . 
  to be honest , so far you really did n't give me any reason to like you . 
  at least i do n't call you illiterate , right ? 
  i do n't want you to like me . 
  you are being arrogant and you are the one who makes assumptions about me , not the other way around . 
  i 've attacked your idea , for which you replied in this manner . 
  when i saw you refused to read or digest anything i 've written , i 've called you illiterate , because i honestly do n't want to believe you ignore my points on purpose . 
   the hu approach again , i see . 
  let 's bring in the un in and make everything even slower and more inefficient . 
  germany can go ahead and make their own guarded bases in syria if they 're so capable , and solve it on it 's own , if you do n't like the united solution . 
  why only the eu has to work on this , and not the un ? 
   i imagine a world , where the host country is telling the other countries : `` nah , i 'm not ready right now , you need to wait a little . 
  we 'll call you back later , ok ? 
  thanks '' . 
  you do n't have to imagine . 
  when hungarians had to flee their country in 1956 , they spent months in austria waiting for host countries like usa , canada to accept them . 
  they were dictating when and how many . 
   55000 refugees from syria voluntarily returned home in 2016 that 's great . 
  [ out of over 1 million ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911 ) , 55 thousand left on their own . 
  no problem then !, 
  the [ 130000 who 's gone missing ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/12174803/germany-admits-130000-asylum-seekers-lost-raising-fears-over-crime-and-terrorism.html ) does n't raise any alarms either . 
  they 're probably busy working somewhere for their plane ticket home . 
   you 're inconsistent . 
  it should be dealt with by germany . 
  but you want to do it on your own . 
  when i tell you , to bring those people directly here , by plane , because they do n't want to waste months of their lives in some shitty camp , you tell me : no !, 
  we do it our way !, 
  good job , again !, 
  your way does not solve the problem . 
  it only makes sure these people get to germany , but as you 've said , it would depend on them to actually leave too . 
  what would happen to those , who refuse to leave and spend all their money ? 
  that moment you would claim we all ( eu ) have to solve this crisis in germany , because they are already there . 
   the route fucks italy and greece over [ italy and have been fucked over by ** illegal immigration ** quite some time now ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/18561247 ) . 
  [ [ screenshot of the article in case of paywall ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ugqvoxi.png ) ] distributing the people who arrive at your border is not a solution to the italian and greek border security strugle . 
  hungary can protect it 's schengen borders as it is required ( although we do enjoy the help of our friends ) , while italy and greece ca n't .
