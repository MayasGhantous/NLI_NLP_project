  they have an alternative and are not stuck in a one-way street to nowhere . 
  how is this any better than denying them in the first place ? 
  it would save them time and all their money . 
  ** do you really want to scam them for 2 months of living costs ? 
  ** that 's ridiculous and totally helpful . 
   now imagine that : you have a lot of people who come here , take a look and see that it 's all shit . 
  they decide that it 's not really worth it . 
  now someone back home comes to them and tells them , `` dude , those guys are pure evil , i 'm gon na bomb them to shit '' . 
  but now the people would say : nah , forget it , they 're as fucked up as we are . 
  their lives are not better than ours . 
  it 's the same struggle everywhere . 
  but they treated us with respect and were not shitty humans . 
  do n't bomb the shit out of them , that 's stupid '' . 
  you are scarily naive . 
  those of them who want to `` bomb us to shit '' want to do so , because of our ideological , theological differences . 
  they do n't care about our living situation . 
  do you honestly believe [ isis commits genocide in iraq and syria ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/16/un-condemns-isis-genocide-against-yazidis-in-iraq-and-syria ) because those people live better than them ? 
   doing it your way , we get people who come here without any money who are literally without alternatives and perspectives and who are fully disappointed and full of hate when they eventually get back to where they came from . 
  my way ? 
  with my way they would n't even cross their own border . 
   i hope it 's simple enough for you . 
  my question was how is it in our interest , and you say if we scam them from the money they have , they will go back . 
  i 'm trying to imagine this work , but i ca n't . 
  what happens when there 's no where to go ? 
  by not giving them a reason to irresponsibly leave their homes and family behind and risk their lives on the way . 
   because it is in our own interest . 
  simple . 
  how exactly is it in our interest ? 
  if it 's simple , you can probably explain it in a way even i could understand . 
   `` i want back the good old times , when i did n't have to care about them , because they were n't here and i could simply ignore the problem '' i might have missed a lecture on this one . 
  why are we obliged to help anybody , again ? 
  also to fix that quote for you : `` i want back the good old times , when i did n't have to take responsibility for the irresponsibility of others . '', 
  rightly so , they should make their voices heard by officials , and ` force ' law enforcement to do their jobs . 
   20-30 people chased police out in two other cases what happens after 20-30 people chase police out of a neighbourhood ? 
  are they not arrested ? 
  here if a situation like that happened , operational police ( k\u00e9szenl\u00e9ti rend\u0151rs\u00e9g ) would be there immediately , arresting everyone . 
  i agree !, 
  fair enough , however my question still stands . 
  how can the people of sweden tolerate that such a place exists in their country ? 
  it should n't be an excuse for them to be dangerous . 
  they should respect law enforcement the same way every other citizen does . 
  my question stands . 
  how can the people tolerate this ? 
  do n't need a magnifying glass to see those cars burning , mate . 
  you 're saying a place with 90 % immigrants are not safe . 
  so , if by any way i find myself in a situation , where 90 % of the people are immigrants ( public transport , school , at work , etc ) i am in a not safe environment ? 
  how can the public tolerate this ? 
  how is it normal ? 
  if it 's normal , how are they not arrested ? 
  how come you are not protesting or rioting for them to be arrested ? 
   police fires a shot ( no one hit ) and the group disperses  shortly after this , reports came in of burning cars in the area https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwb07xh4jaa, 
   look for the incentives . 
  the incentive is to * tell * people ( who do n't really move around ) about how awesome my products are , then announce we open shop near them , and sell them cheaply made garbage . 
   can i get a source for that or is hyperbole the way to go now ? 
  i obviously exaggerate , but this is what i 'm talking about : https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/sep/01/migrants-stranded-in-hungary-train-station-chant-germany-germany-video, 
   because if , for whatever reason , a few million refugees show up at the serbian border and you have trouble handling it it would be an eu problem as well . 
  well , not a few million , but [ quite a lot more than we were used to , did arrive ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_border_barrier#impact_on_the_number_of_illegal_migrants_entering_hungary ) . 
  we managed to solve it on our own this time , but the help of our friends is still welcome . 
   it 's not reliable in the long run because suddenly small political shifts can impact policies that were meant to be reliable . 
  if countries like germany , france or other majors would shift politically , opt-out the same goes for a union that we are in voluntarily ( are we ? ) . 
  if public opinion changed , could we leave the union without restrictions ? 
  looking at the way politicians speak about the situation with the uk , i do n't think so . 
  do your values include centralized decision making in everything ? 
  what 's the point of purchasing the service of your hairdresser ? 
  you want a nice haircut , they want to get paid . 
  in the end , everyone is happy . 
  why ca n't a union be about trying to make everyone pleased with it ? 
  we are quite reluctant , when we see how this great union treats those who want to leave . 
  it 's not a time for us to leave . 
  right now , we ca n't . 
  i think ( generally speaking ) voluntarily support is better , than having the union forcing something on everyone . 
  hungary , poland , slovakia and the czech republic is working together on our serbian border . 
  why is it different for italy and greece ? 
  i believe the only reason he strengthened his anti soros rhetoric , is because he wants to be on good terms with the soon to be ( ? ), 
  us - russia friendship / cooperation . 
  okay , but how can the whole eu expected to help protecting italian and greek seas ? 
  i mean , there are some of us , who do n't have any borders on the water . 
  why does helping out italy need a whole eu solution ? 
  why ca n't italy or greece request the help of individual countries ? 
  how come they ca n't protect their borders on their own ? 
  orb\u00e1n started to talk against the strategies used by soros , he only started to name him in the last year i believe . 
  i guess i was missing ` too ' from your sentence . 
   but in the end every single refugee coming to germany is a polish problem ** too ** and every single illegal border crossing to italy is a hungarian problem ** too ** . 
  like this . 
  if this is what you mean , then i understand your point . 
   i get the feeling that op posted this unironically i do n't understand the use of the word ` unironically ' here . 
   but in the end every single refugee coming to germany is a polish problem and every single illegal border crossing to italy is a hungarian problem . 
  explain , please ? 
   that 's nice of course but it does n't help if italy , greece or any other country has issues they need help with . 
  is this the first time in history , when these countries had to defend their borders ? 
  how is it an eu problem , when every illegally entering `` refugee '' chants `` germoney '' in protest of them being upheld for security reasons ? 
   we can probably all agree that non-eu citizens moving around within the eu is much less of an issue if we control them properly at eu borders . 
  yes , we agree . 
  this is where our `` super anti refugee '' fence comes into play . 
  before the fence , these people were walking through fields and forests , entering our country . 
  now they have to go through the proper border entry points . 
  this made these so called refugees change route . 
  how is this not suspicious for others , is beyond me . 
   to me it 's just such a truly dumb issue in the first place . 
  we can probably all agree that any non-eu citizen that comes to the eu is an issue of everyone withing the union .
