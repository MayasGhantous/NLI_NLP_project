nice composition !, 
  well he certainly has a theme going on . 
  that head hanging ... `` i am a slave of the system '' lol . 
  would be fun knowing what he thought standing there . 
   he does n't do or say things that might not benefit his party in a way i think i read that he 's said recently that he does n't mind being viewed as a dictator though . 
  how would that benefit his party in turkey ? 
  is there a general crave among the population for a putinesque strongman behind the wheel ? 
  is that an exaggeration that he 's trying to undo everything atat\u00fcrk has achieved/shaped turkey to be ? 
  events like what thrwwtrk 's shown us only reinforce atat\u00fcrk 's image as a great benefitor of turkey , would n't really suit erdogan 's agenda i 'd imagine . 
  but maybe i 'm overestimating its significance . 
  wonder how long until erdogan orders them to not sound the sirens . 
  am i overestimating putin and/or underestimating trump ? 
  the latter seems just the guy who if you pull the right cords will be dancing just as you 'd want him to . 
  it 's two stages but we have no electors , it 's direct . 
  * actually it 's one stage now since 2012/2014 apparently, 
  neither in hungary . 
  lol seems like 2016 has n't tought you anything . 
  nah , putin 's smarter than that . 
  `` that 's my boy '', 
  this post has no substance whatsoever . 
  no baklava ? 
  well , if one wants to be optimistic , nato is still alive and kicking as of now , trump 's so far only raised concerns about european members ' contributions not hitting the 2 % threshold . 
  but , as expected , putin is seeking good relations with the us and that could easily be to convince trump about laying off europe . 
  they 'll likely have an easy way doing so , they 'd only reinforce trump 's general ideas . 
  guess we 'll see but if putin 's smart enough he 'll be silent until the initial panic is over . 
  thing is , europe is nowhere near united in opinion and desire , there 's barely any common spirit among us , especially on the east . 
  maybe because of that he can be played from within the house too but i 'd assume the gop is n't full of people you 'd trust being manipulated by lol . 
  and because of that he wo n't question his emotions when he 'll be manipulated by smarter people . 
  one has control over his feelings and actions , the other does not . 
  one 's not like the other though . 
  destroying the us ' image , all in good fun . 
  of course not but you can be assured putin will have a renewed interest in dividing the west . 
  salami tactics take time , if he can play trump he 'll be in a great position to go on with it . 
  at least you 'll be warm in your alps watching the world burn . . :d, 
  well it 's up to you whether you 'd wake up now or when the bear 's already mounting you, 
  from the people 's pow there might still be an amount of pensioners reminiscing about the last couple of years of communism , how things were in `` order '' back then , especially in the east where many lost their jobs after the system has changed . 
  there 's also the classic hungarian mentality of spiting everything , trying to go against the flow , the establishment , `` oppression '' which currently constitutes eu `` rule '' as they see it . 
  people overestimate this remnant of a country , live in the past and project it for the present . 
  they are proud and foolish and ca n't be waken up or be forced to look at things objectively . 
  real self-criticism is underdeveloped in hungary . 
  we have fatalism , melancholy and stubbornness instead . 
  as for orb\u00e1n et al , they 're probably trying to balance between eu and russia , keeping options somewhat open ( which is funny to think at , being already part of eu ) . 
  poland tried that with germany and russia prior to wwii in their false sense of greatness and we all know what happened to them , they got played real hard . 
  of course spineless-headless chicken west are n't a great analogy to the third reich but still , delusion at every level pretty much . 
  it 's more that we need to make it a mostly european thing , not a us thing . 
  maybe if we ask russia nicely, 
  he 'll become putin 's bitch and wo n't even notice . 
  well you live on the safer end so far . 
  nothing , just bend over , close your eyes and pray . 
  mother russia wo n't be gentle . 
  federalize or fall, 
  [ thanks , reminded me of this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrtvqt_wmey ), 
  pass the butter, 
  you are free to prove them wrong with reasoning and facts though . 
  \u00c9rsek\u00fajv\u00e1r ? 
  i like hajd\u00fadorog 's one , awesome heraldry then bam , kebab on sword - with a hedgehog chilling beneath . 
  whereabouts is this ? 
  otoh you chill on beaches in rain & wind . 
  damn right hungarian golden standard ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kappa, 
  just have to bring croatia into the v4 . 
  have china reduced it or gdp growth was just that significant ? 
  also would be interested in an eu cumulative/esa one . 
  hungary ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ , 
  my cousins ' family have been to greece ~ 7 times . 
  they never went anywhere else for holiday . 
  my heart could n't bear it . 
  j/k , just never got around to it ; probably will visit at some point, 
  plenty of bad in it for armenians . 
  for example [ ani ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ani ) was an extremely important armenian capital . 
  [ look at these walls . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/ani_townwall.jpg ) the seljuks ruined it . .  the army entered the city , massacred its inhabitants , pillaged and burned it , leaving it in ruins and taking prisoner all those who remained alive ... the dead bodies were so many that they blocked the streets ; one could not go anywhere without stepping over them . 
  and the number of prisoners was not less than 50,000 souls . 
  i was determined to enter city and see the destruction with my own eyes . 
  i tried to find a street in which i would not have to walk over the corpses ; but that was impossible . 
  and now it 's within turkey . 
  ani , derbent ... these i know from crusader kings ii . 
  it 's really europe outcast there . 
  your soul shall be mine !, 
  [ hungary , austria , czechia , slovakia , croatia , bulgaria , greece , italy , germany , france , uk . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pyixg5o.png ) 11 eu countries , out of 16 ( all european ) that i 've been in . 
  i can see the scandinavian ones pulling out , the rest not really . 
  russia & rumania do . 
  wo n't somebody please think of the mps ? 
  not all , ymd in hungary but we write names backwards too so not that much of a surprise . 
  i think i remember that word vaguely . 
  probably from the slavic mythology themed thea : the awakening . 
  i could n't go today but [ hungary here ] ( http://varkapu.info/sites/default/files/temeto_0.jpg ) . 
  everyone has someone to remember , regardless of belief . 
  it 's a noble tradition ; nothing against it . 
  to hell with that beeping sound , seriously . 
  and [ craiova group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/craiova_group ) , although i do n't know what have they made out of that so far . 
  these acronyms are getting more and more silly . 
   the maple syrup cartel that sounds badass, 
  one less to oppose it , getting there . 
   `` the uk government opposed the previous proposals . 
  however , the uk 's opposition now becomes academic as it 's very unlikely that this will complete all its stages before the uk leaves the eu , '' cheers !, 
  and if you 're a `` child '' . 
  honestly there should be certain serious crimes that 'd warrant being treated as adults in front of court , regardless of age . 
  it may very well be catastrophic for vodka suppliers though . 
   it 's the politicians and media who make it smear everything with shit in order to get obtain votes for one party or another welcome to politics ?
