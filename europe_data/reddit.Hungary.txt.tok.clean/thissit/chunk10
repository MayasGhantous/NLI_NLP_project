  this would be more useful as a percentage of population though . 
  need to work on your macro, 
  on another note those early xx . 
  century ryanair planes really were n't reliable . 
  what 's up with iran ? 
  it is fine to admit that you misunderstood . 
  the ~ ~ empire of ~ ~ v4 welcomes your progress, 
  i remember that 's how / r/the _ donald started . 
  spot the finn, 
  that 's what i was thinking as well . 
  `` m\u0171\u0171\u0171\u0171 '', 
   a significant reality of the country or a significant reality of a particular demographic of a country . 
  swampover, 
  we can into empire, 
  it 's fun revisiting older threads . 
  this angled flag bro 's on a roll, 
  well you know there are certain ways to debate , his does n't seem to be the optimal one lol . 
  yeah read up on his history a bit , think i see what you mean . 
  here we go with the balkans shitstorm again, 
  dual capitals in budapest and bucharest ? 
  or we can just select a random village halfway through :p, 
  * sets desktop background *, 
  i wonder how a trialist monarchy would 've worked out . 
  that sounds cool and neutral , i like it . 
  well you wanted hungary until the tisza line , we wanted transylvania back ... this 'd be a win-win , 
  very much agree on that one . 
  hungarians and romanians lived together in transylvania for a long time anyways . 
  this 'd pull a thorn out for both sides . 
  haha , that 's cheeky :d did n't know this !, 
  i 'm unsure . . the guy ( kazi2000 ) who made this on deviantart said :  such a union would not be out of the question , it has been proposed in the past just after ww1 by a hungarian delegation but the romanian royal goverment refused after two or three years balancing between the pro 's and con 's . 
  basically that event is what inspired me this work !, 
  oh yeah it was wwi then . 
  ca n't link deviantart on this sub though . 
  that 's why i do n't understand the surprise , it was a more or less natural product of a long process . 
  austria and hungary had long mutual history though . 
  oh you 're right . 
  other stats would dip bad though . 
  lol . 
  well i mean that flag would kinda resemble a rainbow ... 
  if i saw that word out in the wild alone i would 've guessed italian . 
  well culturally and historically , when transylvania was still part of hungary , an austria-hungary made much more sense imo . 
  what would be the correct adjective btw ? 
  romo-hungarian sounds odd . 
  did someone say [ nice ] ( http://travelioo.com/img/buda-castle-photo5.jpg ) [ castles ] ( http://budacastlebudapest.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hotel-castle-district-hilton-budapest-andreas-metz.png ) [ ? 
  apparently it was proposed after wwii . 
  could you imagine ? 
  for funsies : * land area : 331,421 km ^ 2 ( 65th ) * population : 29,341,485 ( 45th ) * density : 88.53 / km ^ 2 ( 122nd ) * gdp ( ppp ) total : $ 706.069 billion ( 31st ) per capita : $ 24,063 ( 50th ) * gdp ( nominal ) total : $ 319.197 billion ( 34th ) per capita : $ 10,878 ( 59th ), 
  haha i can imagine the surprise . 
  i like this guy, 
  fun fact , [ we rebuilt it in the capital ( smaller scale ofc ) for the 1896 millennial celebrations ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/vajdahunyad_v%c3%a1ra_t%c3%a9len_a_j%c3%a9gp%c3%a1ly%c3%a1val.jpg/1024px-vajdahunyad_v%c3%a1ra_t%c3%a9len_a_j%c3%a9gp%c3%a1ly%c3%a1val.jpg ) . 
  so for a good 25 years we had two of them . 
  i was to say `` stop breathing then '' but decided to go wholesome this time, 
  `` nuff said '', 
  should import some fresh air like the chinese do . 
  do n't want to burden the rest of europe with jealousy, 
  yeah but that does n't contain the paragraph i linked . 
  flair up !, 
  it is the force that unites us all . 
  [ thank me later ] ( https://translate.google.com/ ), 
  somehow feels like a * hygge * version of [ our parliament building ] ( http://www.aquincumhotel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/budapest-attractions_parlament.png ) . 
  what has he done for turkey ? 
  looks awesome !, 
  apparently was [ regal dominium until 1464 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spi%c5%a1_castle#history ) , got built up to this extent [ during the mongol incursion ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/szepesi_v%c3%a1r#vir.c3.a1gkora ) into hungary . 
  i wonder if `` dort '' is proper use there ? 
  or is that for `` physically there '' ? 
  them good old trabant lvl 2s . 
  it 's fun that with some english/german knowledge you can ( kind of ) guess what dutch people say , at least in text . 
   i see what you there done have . 
  good to hear . 
  it 's pretty much the same in hungary , history happened and that 's that . 
  we even keep your [ baths ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=hu&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=647&amp;q=p%c3%a9cs+mosque&amp;oq=p%c3%a1cs+mosque&amp;gs_l=img.3...1227.2439.0.2610.11.8.0.3.0.0.177.782.2j4.6.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..2.4.449...0j0i5i30k1j0i24k1j0i10i24k1.xhztkrfqism#hl=hu&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=kir%c3%a1ly+bath ) , former [ mosques ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=hu&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=647&amp;q=p%c3%a9cs+mosque&amp;oq=p%c3%a1cs+mosque&amp;gs_l=img.3...1227.2439.0.2610.11.8.0.3.0.0.177.782.2j4.6.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..2.4.449...0j0i5i30k1j0i24k1j0i10i24k1.xhztkrfqism ) and [ minarets ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=hu&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=647&amp;q=p%c3%a9cs+mosque&amp;oq=p%c3%a1cs+mosque&amp;gs_l=img.3...1227.2439.0.2610.11.8.0.3.0.0.177.782.2j4.6.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..2.4.449...0j0i5i30k1j0i24k1j0i10i24k1.xhztkrfqism#hl=hu&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=eger+minaret ) well maintained . 
   i think this is based on amount of nuclear submarines the city can host we need a map like this . 
  oh yeah misunderstood , apologies then . 
  what do you think would 've been the correct move from matthias in that situation ? 
  with the ottomans growing stronger day by day ( and hre meddling west ) , having a strong mercenary army seemes to me as a good idea . 
  maybe he should 've stopped at some point and not overextend ( with ) it ? 
  hungary really does n't get the credit it deserves regarding fighting the ottoman empire . 
  it 's always just `` hey , poland reinforced vienna that one time , they saved all europe alone '' . 
  ~ ~  you know maybe he should n't have . 
  in general fekete sereg brought more harm than glory . 
  it was a important part in european history though . ~ ~ ~ ~ he relocated his court there afterwards . ~ ~ ~ ~ i 'm assuming here but i 'd wager he would n't have if it was a pile of steaming , worthless rubble after the black army took it . ~ ~, 
  ah right , should 've said [ from the 1430s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_hunyadi ) so 250 + . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_belgrade_ ( 1440 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_belgrade_ ( 1456 ) also we were very much fine until 1526 . 
  even captured vienna under matthias corvinus in 1485 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:the_wars_of_matthias_corvinus_of_hungary_ ( 1458-1490 ) . png https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_vienna_ ( 1485 ), 
  curious , how do turkish people view hungarians ? 
  yeah and hungary keeping them at bay for 150 years ... 
  eu density 116.4 / km ^ 2 us density 35/km ^ 2 also distance between cities ( or settlements even ) is way more on average than in europe . 
  do n't worry there 's at least one capital from our empire there , 
  no forest , no mountains ... what * do * you have ? 
  they also forgot to include the * cordon sanitaire * in their studies . 
  most of buda is sweet . 
  feels like a smaller scale budapest ( looking down from the citadella ) . 
  all i see is a bunch of \u00e4s and some numbers . 
   used by 2 squarrels in 2015 i bet the company that won the tender did n't mind that . 
  this troll is fairly weak, 
  so how did you figure it was only 1.4 m in 1920 without census ? 
  i 'd guess you went off the romanian census for 1910 and assumed in between until the 1930 hungarian one . 
  but so long as you do n't try to cut the number to 1m during the vienna award i do n't think it 's that important after all . 
  anyways , time to sleep . 
  good talk , have a good night !,
