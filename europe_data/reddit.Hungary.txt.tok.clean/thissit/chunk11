  good , so long as you 're ok and know i meant no harm with this post . 
  alright , just checking if you minded . 
  it 's also sort of an experiment to see if they actually check what they 're reading before commenting . 
  got some whoosh moments already ... , 
  want me to delete it ? 
   like always with this kind of map we only know the reported ones ikr , imagine all the harvests that go unnoticed . 
   there was no census in 1920 afaik , why did you choose 1920 , seems arbitrary . 
  lol i quoted you from your previous comment . 
   well last time i mentioned szekler autonomy there was vehement opposition to it from romanians . 
  why is that ? 
  what could you lose with it ? 
  also would be curious of the answer to this . 
   they were 1.4 m in 1920  i 'm talking about the 1930 census not sure how the 1930 census was counted for 1920  well last time i mentioned szekler autonomy there was vehement opposition to it from romanians . 
  why is that ? 
  what could you lose with it ? 
  well certainly not in its current state . 
  but one can dream !, 
  i do n't know where you got that number from , all the sources i see on the english wiki state [ 1.6 m in 1910 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_trianon#distribution_of_the_non-hungarian_and_hungarian_populations ) . 
  you could just give autonomy to sz\u00e9kelyf\u00f6ld , \u00e1 la vojvodina , that 'd be a decent middle ground . 
  snow in europe certainly is europe related though . 
  they 'll probably need lots of that to counteract him . 
  and here i am thinking how better it could potentially be if the eu took usa 's place in the global scene . 
  [ see this section . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_vienna_award#statistics ) you go with at the time 30 year old romanian estimates , i go with at the time recent , hungarian ones . 
  i do n't see a point in arguing this . 
   what did you need 1 million romanians in your small country ? 
  what did you need 1.7 out of 7.7 million hungarians in your small country for in 1920 ( and wanted * even more * until the tisza line ) ? 
  you mean in the middle of 1000 years ' hungarian land . 
   vienna award got you more romanian ethnics than hungarians no , we got 1.3 million hungarians with 1m romanians . 
  we can into another couple vienna awards , sure , 
  it certainly wo n't die out in my lifetime :d, 
  last i heard you guys are dropping as well :p, 
  maybe time for another pu , 
  and portugal . . though * we * almost beat portugal too . 
  i was coming from his australian flair , i 'd imagine he 'll have a pretty good time with proper income in hungary . 
   purchasing power , which is much lower than other countries in the eu [ i would n't say that ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k5xne7j.jpg ) , sure it 's on the lower end but not `` much lower than everyone else in the eu '' . 
  it 's not a nice place to be in but we are n't the lowest , especially not by far . 
  with proper income it 's a good life in hungary , everything 's cheap . 
  meanwhile we 're falling towards 9 million . . 
  looks like an autumn hungarian forest . 
  there you go !, 
   kepp close to visegrad group i like that attitude !, 
  yeah man since hitler or stalin did not kill millions by their very hands they 're not responsible for all that happened during their time & on their orders . 
  what the hell is this logic . 
   china ... `` must , to the maximum degree possible , be dismantled '' . 
  dugin suggests that russia start by taking tibet-xinjiang-mongolia-manchuria as a security belt . 
  does n't he overestimate russia/underestimate china a bit ? 
  madrid + riddance \u0171 yeah it 's quite a sweaty one, 
  is great !, 
  poland can into western europe ? 
  well it makes sense . 
  if you come from a poorer country you 'd generally be more inclined to work a harder job for what 's considered low pay in a wealthy one than the ones already living there . 
  think they miss your / s tag . 
   my fiend !, 
  j/k , you do you i do n't mind, 
  probably , only a handful would be enough for a war anyway . 
  but it 's more like deterrence than anything else . 
  iirc even against napoleon 's 1-2 ( ? ), 
  million you only had a few hundred thousand infantry , mostly focused on navy . 
  it was 2 years for me too . 
  i wanted to drive tanks and shoot guns for free :(, 
  makes it look like a post card or painting , i like it . 
  do you think they 'd send their riffraff to meet with us/south korea soldiers ? 
  that 's probably one of their most well fed . 
   mystery meat if that is n't an euphemism i do n't know what is, 
  goes well with wine in a damn carton box . 
  * disowns comment *, 
  so did earth . 
  i do n't know if that 's the incentive they need, 
  ` in spite of them all ', 
  got ta throw an insult in for good measure, 
  such is life, 
  \\  tfw trying to sound smart does n't work out, 
  that 's what the map is about . 
  even with all those high prices they still beat most real * countries . 
  well i did not expect portugal to be nearly on par with hungary . 
  also moldova with syria of all places . 
  looks like an elephant to me . 
  it 's an elephant with odd ears , no trunk and growth hormone defect . 
  how could it be , bielefeld does n't exist . 
  yep that was it probably . 
   and use the context yeah the point was that i would n't call that engineering . 
  sure it plays a role but putting something appalling on a decent spot does n't make it instantly great . 
  was it like that during karajan 's time ? 
  b. . but ... 
  art !!, 
   how a buidling does react with its enviroment . 
  so how do you go about that without altering everything in a * n * m radius ? 
  it 's ` great architecture ' maybe in the sense that you choose a decent spot . 
  but that has little to do with * actual * architecture . 
  they did n't build the river around that glass thingy either . 
  it 's the glass and steel manifestation of the phrase `` please kill me '', 
  looks odd from what i can tell . 
  sorry it 's a habit we picked up from language maps . 
  [ we have our very own special place ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tgnyafs.png ) ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ yes ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ map ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ irrelevant ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ wanted ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ throw ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ out ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ there, 
  if you moved to scandinavia the snow would probably melt in a 10 mile radius around you . 
  well it 's much easier to see the flag the way you rotated it , i do n't mind it at all . 
  `` was worth a try '',
