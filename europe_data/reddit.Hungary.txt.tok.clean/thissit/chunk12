  because cape physics . 
  cheering for the homeboy i see, 
  raise problems - do n't offer solutions that 's so hungarian, 
  it 's fine , got some karma to spare . 
  can still get that mug !, 
  well that 's mature, 
  sorry i will not do it again, 
  i 've seen this with pakistan in the title earlier, 
  czechia pulling a hungary, 
  [ ask the guys in bratislava ] ( http://i.imgur.com/epwwwhg.png ), 
  one of the most fascinating examples : [ timgad ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lxbzrfy.jpg ), 
  i did n't realize they pay rent in and import their food from poland , thanks for the eye opener . 
  i like the colours . 
  disadvantageous to look somehow ? 
  man , you really ca n't win . 
  0:53 looks like paradise extreme . 
  well one can always find excuses if they try hard enough . 
  as they should . 
  with these maps : as loose as possible . 
  [ where 's the bomb ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj4nznv7eo8 ), 
  whereabouts ? 
   at least the poles are nice i think this is a key point that ~ ~ many ~ ~ some seem to forget every now and then . 
  well [ we even defied hitler to help them !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungary%e2%80%93poland_relations#world_war_ii )  in six months , during his 1939 invasion of poland , the common polish-hungarian border would become of major importance when admiral horthy 's government , on the ground of long-standing polish-hungarian friendship , declined , as a matter of `` hungarian honor , '' hitler 's request to transit german forces across carpathian rus into southeastern poland to speed that country 's conquest . 
  the hungarian refusal allowed the polish government and tens of thousands of military personnel to escape into neighboring hungary and romania , and from there to france, 
  should have a scale, 
   14 minutes is nothing that 's about 15 minutes more than acceptable . 
  tbh it 's the finnish who 'd give everything first anyway . 
  yeah you might have to tone that down , it 's not for the w-eu stomach :o) ^ ^ ^ france ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ fav, 
  whew , that was close . 
  enjoy your time on the archipelago , little green man, 
  that 's more of a sad memory really :\\, 
  but i want to be offended ^ ^ ^ ^ please ? 
  please do, 
  you could be called western southern estonia for nostalgia purposes . 
  and even that barely . 
  congrats on the snow, 
  i like how right by the epicentre there 's a not felt symbol . 
  flawless victory what did he say at the very end in russian ( ? ), 
  oh , * we * hate everyone , not everyone hates us . 
  that 's a bit better i guess . 
  ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ too ^ ^ ^ green, 
  that 2.5 - 6.99 bracket is really generous to the us . 
  ( before that , much smaller scales , wtf ), 
  good ole pollenbal . 
  indians seem to speak almost half english half hindi nowadays anyway . 
   but over 100,000 in nigeria are at risk of starvation out of a population of 190,000,000 ? 
  i do n't see your point . 
  [ according to the wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nigeria ) it 's increased by 50,000,000 between 2006 and 2015 , just * nine * years . 
  latvia seems to be invaded by russian . 
  well that 's also connected with happiness in some way , is n't it . 
  thanks bro , you too , albeit that 's the morning here . 
  they had to chuck us somewhere, 
  i know that type from red baron :d https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_baron_ ( 1990_video_game ), 
  imagine having to bring that utility post everywhere, 
  i like how they just pushed buda & pest down the danube to make space for the letters . 
  i really do n't mind elegant & safe solutions . 
  sounds delicious . 
  looks like a game of euiv, 
  not really , no . . :d but the other one does n't strike me as austrian either . 
  * shrugs *, 
   bicska that 's no pocket knife , it 's a fully grown knife man . 
  i 'd say the actually confusing part would be that the younger , hungarian-looking figure is more to the west than the other one . 
  also can have proper fun in cs : go, 
  \u0150ism\u00e4e looks kinda neat for a soviet abomination . 
  could 've used more trees though . 
  [ here you go buddy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:austria-hungary_map_new.svg ), 
  could use some * dolce vita * lessons from our rotated flag brothers . 
  if he fails , eu might disintegrate . 
  2016 only has 19 days left , wonder what else can it mess up in that time . 
  it 's the thought that counts . 
  sometimes i feel that 's all we remember too haha . 
  that 's probably the sole reason why, 
   the tang fought against the ummayyad abbasid caliphate in the battle of talas i remember that battle from crashcourse history 's relevant yt vid . 
  we came , we saw , we settled in . 
  til water is wet . 
  i 'd guess there 's a reason they are overplayed then . 
  i do n't mind either way , just enjoy them for what they are .

  i 'll take `` things that wo n't happen '' for 100 . 
  that 's human nature for ya . 
  well they also get all the credit for saving europe from the ottomans , only vienna matters . 
  `` you work , men '', 
  might have been 10 years ago , indeed . 
  been to the rhine area f\u00fcr weltjugendtag in 2006 , had a great time . 
  i should explore latvian cuisine , i * love * potatoes . 
  also top presentation there . 
  that first wan looks great , is it fried ? 
  like 2/3 goes straight through hungary . 
   in my opinion that is not fair and correct . 
  that 's literally how it is in the eu law . 
  complain to brussels i suppose ? 
  why would it be ? 
  they 'll be members for 2 years after a50 gets evoked , as well .
