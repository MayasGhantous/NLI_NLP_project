  bit of a k.u.k. 
  does n't hurt every now and then , 
  [ i love you for making me find this channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yocja_n5s1i&amp;index=1&amp;list=plbda2e52fb1ef80c9 ), 
  now that 's taking health & safety seriously . 
  this seems to be a recurring motive in democracies nowadays . 
  alright we 'll delay it for now . 
  we had two cancelled ones , that almost adds up to one . 
  it 's for the future potus . 
  trump being trump has little to do with it . 
  have n't they taken it from austria ? 
  [ at least the tune for it . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06643umejzg ), 
  we did n't found a kingdom just to haul it back to asia 1000 + years later !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yltuky9fv9y ), 
   100 % european the important part, 
  we 'd be fine with that . 
  sometimes it feels like they just wanted to put us in some group for the sake of grouping things together ( not denying connection though ) . 
  yeah underground opened in 1890 . 
  budapest had it for the millennial celebrations in 1896 . 
  there were some exceptions ; not balkans , but near , eg . 
  the first underground railway on the continent opened in budapest in 1896 , second in the world only to the british one , opened 6 years prior . 
   i see you 're romanian so you probably know already what 's happening here , but i 'll say it anyway . 
  it 's more for anyone stumbling upon the thread . 
  they lean towards each other , should they crumble they 'll be held by each other more or less , no worries . 
  looks akin to a factory or power plant without chimneys . 
  that mosque must be like `` save me '', 
  proper legend would distract from the strong pr message . 
  that looks so much better . 
  what did you do ? 
  `` visiting the colonies '', 
  i think it 's to keep the , um , theme of the downtown/historic centry mostly consistent . 
  i was actually contradicting my other comment lol . 
  wow , i remember not terribly long ago there was nothing but a `` muddy '' bay there . 
  at least it 's mostly away from the city centre . 
  really ? 
  i sure hope they wo n't let them . 
  fun fact : no building in budapest can be taller than the parliament building ( 96m iirc ? ), 
  also a building and water and stuff, 
  battle of britain - chapter ii : nato infighting, 
  i remember seeing a budapesterstra\u00dfe in germany ( bonn ? ), 
  as well . 
  it 's more of a pastry than a candy i 'd say . 
  it 's super delicious either way !, 
  or some bird sitting on top of his head . . 
  it is poor but much so is your east . 
  you know full well that it stinks much more so piss off . 
  who do you think you are, 
  what made austria worsen that much ? 
  there 's a face in the baltic, 
  [ kinda reminiscent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np0tv4bafpm ), 
  strange , the balaton is [ 26 \u00b0 c atm ] ( http://met.hu/idojaras/tavaink/balaton/ ) . 
  do n't know how can the adriatic be 30 \u00b0 c average but seems implausible . 
  you are right . 
  i 'd like to get over it too . 
  it 's strange because we do n't have this with slovakia , croatia or serbia which also were ( partially ) our territories . 
  that 's interesting !, 
  shows a much different view than the map of this thread . 
  thanks !, 
  10 ^ 9 [ zloty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/z%c5%82oty ) i think, 
  maybe in lakes in the mountains ? 
  or maybe they have a larger area of responsibilities than what their name implies . 
  you do n't drown and also have a large purple marker around you in case you 'd set sail towards the mediterranean . 
  longcuts ? 
  do n't mention the war [ !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfl6lu3xqw0 ), 
  that could be an interesting map as well . 
  even nominal is 25 % more . 
  * i like how you ninja edited the `` to the hell '' part out of your comment after i replied . 
  where are [ these conditions ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6r2k75/romania_commits_to_nato_defense_spending_target/dl1xqxh/?st=j5v8epze&amp;sh=eeafa99e ) on that map again ? 
  [ i too can find maps favorable for us btw ] ( http://imgur.com/pz8it8b ), 
  your point ? 
  we do n't have medieval conditions for half the country . 
  [ all good ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/jwnpackjdipsi/giphy.gif ), 
  i do n't get people barefoot on the streets . 
  do n't they realize how filthy it is ? 
  denying the truth is n't how you fix it . 
  i do n't really see that happening in the near future though . 
  we have these battlegroups i suppose but that 's far from a second nato . 
  by nationality , likely not by culture . 
  every time georgia 's name pops up i want to go play crusader kings ii . 
  do n't think it has to do anything with spiting the us . 
  no marshall plan :(, 
  2 % of gdp is 2 % of gdp for everyone ... 
  good job . 
  we all should really , to become less reliant on the us . 
  they could get together into one happy country !, 
  it was part of the funny :(, 
  ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ~ ~ annex ~ ~ ^ ^ ^ join ^ ^ ^ them, 
  sweden stop bullying your shield !, 
  friendship with greece ended , now bulgaria is my new best friend, 
  agreed , much easier to read . 
  i see some of these colours . 
   europe 942 23.3 % no need to change sub name yet !, 
  and are therefore absolved of their sins in the eyes of the west . 
  haha yeah that 's a good point . 
  at least you have something to semi-expect in the distance . 
  i 'd imagine the danube gets really dirty until it arrives to budapest . 
  tfw they do n't get the concept of professional military . 
  what 's the meaning of hungary 's colour ? 
  happy birthday beautiful country .
