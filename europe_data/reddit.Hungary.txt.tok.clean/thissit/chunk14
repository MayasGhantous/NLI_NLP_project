  you could find out ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  it should drop like 5-10 \u00b0 c after the rain though . 
  if it 's a proper one . 
  london-syndrome ? 
  exactly , you have all the infrastructure for it already . 
  check his history , i doubt anything of value is lost . 
  not pictured : superior eu tech water filter system between the two vessels . 
  ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/h6krghgrmbbwa/giphy.gif ), 
  well switzerland has plenty of other beautiful places - if seeing any picture of switzerland is something to go by , 
  i know , i was just making a funny, 
  such maps are not very keen on smaller countries . 
  that 's a lot of places to be from . 
  that artificial waterfall just does n't feel right . 
  [ up the shut fuckings !!, 
  they returned home because it was n't comfy enough there . 
  hungary was ready to register refugees/migrants all along , before fence , after fence . 
  they refused to , striked then tried to storm trains for austria and germany . 
  the quota system is flawed . 
  those migrants want western countries ' welfare , not hungary from where even natives leave . 
  it 's not a solution . 
  there is a difference between * refugees * and illegal immigrants . 
  those who ngos fish from the libyan coast are n't refugees . 
  they are illegal migrants trying to score . 
  i ( and most of who i know ) have no problem with actual refugees fleeing war torn countries . 
  * those * are welcome anytime . 
  we wo n't carry your baggage from unlawful decisions ( germany ) / incompetence ( italy ) though . 
  [ reenacting the classic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjl6mofmqhk&amp;t=1m26s ), 
  fits perfectly into his narrative unfortunately . 
  only at night . 
  armenian or georgian ? 
  georgian might be more swirly . 
  yeah ... still would n't dip, 
  i think they just had their sea borders with italy adjusted, 
  in scotland ? 
  that sucks man . 
  did they take anything ? 
  i mean you 're not wrong . 
   the oppressive western institution of consent i thought it was obvious he did n't mean it seriously ? 
  showcasing half a year for the entire century ? 
  yeah still odd . 
  well i was thinking of the stereotypes british have about romanians , which i ca n't recall of any other nationalities there . 
  but you can interepret it however it feels best for you i do n't mind . 
  he held it for 5 months did n't he ? 
  may - september 1600 so that 'd be 5 months in that year . 
  yeah found it strange as well . 
  it was the principality of transylvania at that point , tributary to the ottoman empire . 
  also marking the [ hunnic empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/huns#unified_empire_under_attila ) as being present in wallachia only . 
  odd map . 
  i guess that goes for assumptions as well . 
  well that 's a touch racist . 
  why would they ? 
  do n't know how it works man , i 'm just able to differentiate in this case . 
  there are many cases where i ca n't though . 
  how do you know they are gypsies ? 
  such as ? 
  romania with 4x more crimes than the rest of eastern europe . 
  guess there are stereotypes for a reason ? 
  everywhere i 've been in hungary people made a strong point about not drinking if driving for the group . 
  the police here take it very seriously . 
  no matter what , even just a random check on the road , you are getting your breath analyzed . 
   following the battle , vrs forces were observed to be less likely to engage french un peacekeepers deployed in the city . 
  they earned the serbs ' respect . 
  i would n't support my country 's representatives in that decision . 
  but is n't it like 1/3 has to disagree in this case ? 
  i 'm red-green colourblind but can read it alright . 
  they must , this is no joke . 
  i did n't , can delete if you want me to i do n't mind either way . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ since ^ ^ ^ he ^ ^ ^ did n't ^ ^ ^ put ^ ^ ^ `` the '' ^ ^ ^ before ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ sshh, 
  i mean you tried, 
   waterfall that 's a pretty descriptive name . 
  and my ~ ~ axe ~ ~ recurve bow !, 
  that 's a difference between orb\u00e1n 's party and pis then . 
  nah , just reap what you sowed . 
  well he was n't sitting around in his castle that 's for sure . 
  is it actually safe to tun on ac in these circumstances ? 
  haha , glove holder ... ie . 
  the one under the airbag opposite the driver 's side in cars . 
   ethnicity did n't really matter in those days not sure what was the point of your comment bringing up the ethnicity of his father 's ancestors then ? 
  but as you said it would n't matter either way . 
  both were born , raised in and devoted their entire lives to hungary and hungarian affairs . 
  two great figures anyone could be proud of . 
  apart from that he was hungarian you are right . 
  [ oh , the good old days ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/the_wars_of_matthias_corvinus_of_hungary_%281458-1490%29.png ), 
  you 're thinking of croatia , best we can offer is a dzs . 
  ^ ^ ^ darth ^ ^ ^ plagueis ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ wise ? 
  indeed , 
  it 's on the horizon , far right . 
  what was this measured by ? 
  no worries man , thanks for posting !, 
  always interesting to see these . 
  what do you mean no data for uk ? 
  they 're still in for 2 years and you counted norway as well . 
  yeah that 's a good point actually . 
  we will never know, 
  i for one do n't mind you having part of hungary 's coa as yours . 
  it makes sense historically . 
  hungary-style , i like it . 
  felt like cycling through initial crest selection in ckii . 
  also i like how you incorporated [ the double cross ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_hungary ) into hungary 's emblem . 
  wow they did a good job with the palace .
