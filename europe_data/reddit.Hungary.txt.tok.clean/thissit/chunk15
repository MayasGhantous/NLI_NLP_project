  haha i take that . 
  though at least you guys do n't have as bad of a name in the west for resilience as hungary does . 
  what 's the appeal of rotting on the sun in such a crowded area anyway ? 
  few hundred meters from the actual sea ... 
   i do that as well with some countries . 
  so see you in budapest soon ? 
  there 's a chance for that anywhere in the world so ... 
  alright you guys just put bulgaria on my radar for the near future . 
  proud fighter living off a welfare state . 
  i really like how you call them romans instead of byzantines . 
  just as everyone was calling them for most of history . 
  ` gate of the huns ' is a badass town name . 
  as always , it 'll be too late when they realize that things went south . 
  would you like a cup of \u0150 ? 
  -20 is considered low by a finn ? 
  that second panel tho, 
   and this sub will become normal again welcome to / r/europe , that 's not how we operate . 
  admit it , it 's just a football stadium in disguise . 
  wrong for hungary , it is the 100m tall [ esztergom basilica ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1cqspwu.png ) , also the tallest building in the country . 
  `` kill me '', 
  we kept out of the war until 1941 and were already attempting negotiation with the allies in 1943 . 
  that 's two years . 
  he even declined hitler 's request to allow nazi troops through hungary during the invasion of poland and let polish refugees through . 
   people in glass houses as i said , that 's what is n't exactly true . 
  you 're equalling an ouccupied country 's puppet government 's actions to an independent empire 's actions . 
  yeah i did but your counter was flawed so i pointed it out . 
  nice argument . 
  oh , good old whataboutism . 
  that happened ** after the nazis invaded hungary ** ( for the very reason of our reluctance to commit to holocaust ... ) and deposed the legit government . 
  it says in the very first sentence of what you linked . 
  meanwhile , japanese troops deliberately rounded up and massacred chinese and other ethnicities when they were in power . 
  since when is it chic in the uk to defend such atrocities ? 
   [ great culture , great history ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japanese_war_crimes ), 
  which is an insignificant amount compared to the rest . 
  are you saying those initial dozen votes count more than the 3000 + we are at now because they supported your claim ? 
  makes no sense , you should look at the whole picture . 
  with taxes . 
   1,037 points ( 90 % upvoted ) how 's that narrative working out now ? 
  this is no strong and stable comment . 
  til, 
   and the anarchy flag will also be removed but think about the children ... !, 
  you did n't go far for new world, 
   and is even behind france 's president , emmanuel macron , in britain that 's actually hilarious . 
  not unexpected but still . 
  well teleki sure has changed appearance since i last saw him . 
  what . 
  the primary reason nazi germany invaded hungary and installed the puppet govt was that we tried to negotiate a secret treaty with the allies but did n't succeed with it , unlike romania . 
  what are you supposed to do with the nazis sitting on your throat after capturing the country ? 
  jump into a collective pit of death ? 
  what a nonsense argument . 
  i 'm starting to think that you 're just taking the piss because your points are stupidly biased and flawed . 
  citation needed, 
  i responded with what he brought up . 
  hungary tried and kept out of the war until 1941 and were already attempting negotiation with the allies in 1943 . 
  that 's two years . 
  also the horthy government was reluctant to give out hungarian jews which is one of the reasons germany eventually invaded and replaced the legit hungarian government with radicals . 
  for some reason you really have this agenda going but your interpretation does n't change facts . 
  also slovakia and transylvania were part of hungary for a millennuim prior , until the end of wwi . 
  those decisions did n't come out of the blue and focused primarily on hungarian inhabited areas as much as local demography allowed for without creating exclaves . 
  it 's also an interesting interpretation painting some axis aligned countries victims and some manifested evil themselves . 
  as i said , you 're well fed on half truths . 
  it 's a paradox trademark at this point . 
  you do realize that both czechoslovakia and romania were axis right ? 
  you 're well fed on half truths i see . 
  you set him up with a yes/no question . 
   you just come out of a devastating war , your strategy is to wait for them to come to you . 
  i doubt france/uk were worse off initially than germany , who were restricted in military production/research/active personnel 20 years longer than they were . 
  after all , you managed to field quite a significant army initially , germany 's strategy and tactics were just more effective than yours . 
  hitler even said that he did n't expect france to crumble so fast/easily . 
   i do n't fault polish disappointment of the results of ww2 . 
  you ca n't fault them for their disappointment while expecting actual support at the beginning either , when there were literally no other clashes on the continent at the time . 
  things like this can be expected to carry on through when a nation gets shocked into oblivion as a ( perceived or real ) result . 
  i 'm not saying it 's reasonable for any contemporary pole to spit in any british/french face because it . 
  of course not . 
  but on forums like this , debating a historic topic , such can and do tend to come up . 
  with all that said i 'm no pole so ca n't comment on whether they have a specific thing for france in particular or not at the moment . 
  well churchill held anti-semitic views as well yet he 's still counted as a great man . 
  not saying either of them were right just that for some it might be more forgivable ( apparently ) than for others . 
  is it ? 
  i have n't heard of anything related for a while . 
  mind emphasizing ? 
  i hope you 're just taking the piss, 
  i read through the other threads and did n't find much inconsistency in your comments so i 'll retract that part , apologies . 
  what you argue is understandable from your point of view but you have to understand the polish perspective as well . 
  they expected meaningful support , not a thousand-man endeavour 1-2 weeks after they got invaded ( at which point 1/3 -1 / 2 of poland was already taken ) . 
  when you signed the treaty the message clearly was n't one of `` okay we 'll watch how you get steamrolled then we send in a nominal force and call it a day . '', 
  you ca n't fauilt polish disappointment over this . 
  it depends on how you take criticism i guess . 
  but now you contradict your other arguments in the thread with the guy . 
  are we playing with alternative realities here as well ? 
  thought that was only in in the us . 
  you 're messing up the timeline here . 
  [ you started trolling him ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mf0zi/invasion_of_second_polish_republic_september_1939/dk15qyx/ ) after [ this opinion of his ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6mf0zi/invasion_of_second_polish_republic_september_1939/dk14ss7/ ) - which was a sound argument , supported by your observation ( s ) afterwards that france never actually planned to go beyond the maginot line . 
  about the apologetic tone i clearly talked about your posts in this thread . 
  i think you 're deliberately smokescreening now . 
  with that defence you should n't try to silence / u/santo-subito then . 
  i mean apart from this entire apologetic narrative you 've carried in all your comments ... 
  also ignored the point / u/spirit _ inc made . 
  what 's your point ? 
  are you debating that france/uk did n't honor their obligations ?
