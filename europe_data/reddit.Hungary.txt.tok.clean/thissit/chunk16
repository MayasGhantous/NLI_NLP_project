  they clearly did not . 
  of course treaties only matter while they have substance for the parties but do n't try to paint yourselves as innocents . 
  * you started it !, 
   yes , yes they fucking did . 
  heck yeah but they did for several months what i do honoring ai dow requests in games : accept and contribute nothing . 
   even though poland was overrun in about five weeks in the german invasion of poland beginning on 1 september 1939 and soviet invasion beginning on 17 september 1939 , the western allies did nothing . 
  war had been declared by each side , but no western power committed to launching a significant land offensive , ** notwithstanding the terms of the anglo-polish and franco-polish military alliances which obliged the united kingdom and france to assist poland ** . 
  to be fair the maginot line worked perfectly where the main fortifications were built . 
  you just did n't ( fully ) expect hitler to go * that far * . 
  if you were poland vs ai germany and ussr you 'd beat them on both fronts ... 
  it 's the real life equivalent of a steam achievement . 
  and not trying to balance between the two powers you were surrounded by for the past decade or so . 
  we even have a polish-hungarian friendship day , [ march 23 ^ rd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/march_23#holidays_and_observances ), 
  * we have quite an intertwined history . 
  among other things like fighting in each others ' uprisings , [ there were two hungarian-polish unions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_hungary_and_poland ) . 
  i do enjoy reading about our defiance , to spite hitler [  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungary%e2%80%93poland_relations#world_war_ii )  hitler would soon have cause to rue his decision regarding the fate of carpatho-ukraine . 
  in six months , during his 1939 invasion of poland , the common polish-hungarian border would become of major importance when admiral horthy 's government , on the ground of long-standing polish-hungarian friendship , declined , as a matter of `` hungarian honor , '' hitler 's request to transit german forces across carpathian rus into southeastern poland to speed that country 's conquest . 
   the hungarian refusal allowed the polish government and tens of thousands of military personnel to escape into neighbouring hungary and romania . 
  not inaccurate . 
  well if i was eating it 24/7 i would get fed up with it quite fast as well . 
  always refreshing to see things in a different light , thanks, 
  why ? 
  it 's delicious . 
  \\* bop *, 
  i should n't be eating milchreis reading this . 
  if you produce too much you end up touching . 
  fyi bbc changed it to [ hundreds of thousands ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40547972 ) now . 
  still way underestimating ofc . 
  it also says `` organizers say up to 2 million '', 
  godspeed turkey . 
  hope for the best for you . 
  i thought it was in english, 
  yeah , did n't check for that . 
  africa, 
  i blame eurostat, 
  yup we had a good share of mongols as well ( we use tatars synonymously ) , they halved our population pretty much . 
  mostly because we fucked up at mohi though . 
  i mean yeah , but compare a couple battles with your entire kingdom 's affairs revolving around ottomans for 2-300 years . 
  i do n't mean to take away credit where it 's due for you , i 'm just simply pointing out that people tend not to give credit for hungary which is quite an oversight to say the least . 
  not in that battle but people always forget hungary 's role in keeping you away from the west from 1366 to 1566 . 
  they just praise the poles since only vienna matters apparently . 
  it 's a bit frustrating considering the effects it had on the country . 
  yup , single handedly saved europe . 
  [ nevermind hungary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman_wars_in_europe#1526.e2.80.931566:_conquest_of_the_kingdom_of_hungary ) , struggling with and holding the ottomans at bay [ for the past 200 years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman%e2%80%93hungarian_wars ) . 
  it was all the poles , 
  maybe he 's a germ ~ ~ an ~ ~ ophobe, 
  til zagreb does n't have one . 
  are you like 12, 
  good idea, 
  yeah [ we already decapitated stalin ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=hu&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=641&amp;q=1956+revolution+stalin&amp;oq=1956+revolution+stalin&amp;gs_l=img.3...594.4730.0.5622.22.22.0.0.0.0.111.1959.18j4.22.0....0...1.1.64.img..0.16.1488...0j0i19k1j0i30i19k1j0i5i30i19k1j0i8i30i19k1j0i30k1j0i5i30k1j0i8i30k1.iwttloscbek ) during the '56 revolution . 
  some world wars would like to have a word, 
  we moved a lot of these into a [ memorial park ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=hu&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=672&amp;q=budapest+memorial+park&amp;oq=budapest+memorial+park&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i19k1.455.3683.0.3903.24.11.0.0.0.0.856.2140.0j2j0j1j0j1j1.5.0....0...1.1.64.img..19.5.2139...0j0i8i30i19k1j0i30i19k1.aw8oqkqjdgu ) , it 's quite interesting actually . 
  and a memento of the past of course . 
  ny\u00f3cker l\u00e1jf, 
  well i guess we 'll just have to wait and see . 
  would n't be a fast process to erase atat\u00fcrk 's legacy i 'd imagine . 
  i do n't recall any islamic country nuking cities though . 
  yeah but if turkey keeps on the current route ? 
   arabs think we are too much european . 
  that 's set to change though , is n't it, 
  thanks putin, 
  welcome to the middle east . 
  good enough, 
  finnish riviera huh ? 
  agreed . 
   goddamn those hard working poles taking lazy brits ' jobs they do n't even want . 
  such a burden . 
  at least we can blame them for our problems and shortcomings . 
  well check out / r/atheism , it 's an active religion-hating circlejerk most of the time . 
  i think things like that is where he gets this notion from . 
  it 's starting to feel a bit like an `` alternative religion '' , at least in the us , lately . 
  from his comment :  the nazi gifted part of transilvania to hungarian extremists, 
  \\  pic not entirely relevant, 
  it should be mandatory eu-wide . 
  it 's a no brainer really . 
  would be curious of a map regarding vaccination status in europe . 
  edit : [ found a relevant 2010 document ] ( http://www.eurosurveillance.org/images/dynamic/ee/v17n22/art20183.pdf ), 
  but was n't it too loose of a federation for that ? 
  i mean why not also mark lithuania or prussia as states then , for example ? 
  i 'm unsure just poking in the dark . 
  * especially * the turtle, 
  what is that seemingly vaguely drawn blob labeled as russia ? 
  it says `` hungary awaits you '' by the heart and the web address is discoverit.home ( as in hungary ) . hu, 
  you chose the hard way !, 
  it 's an interesting phenomenon but several travel abroad more than staying in hungary for holidays . 
  some years ago at least , it was due to prices being nearly identical ( excluding travel cost ) home or abroad . 
  i 've been to greece and italy a couple times before i had a proper ( not just pop down to balaton on a weekend ) hungarian holiday . 
  that 's neat , do you speak both languages then ? 
  we do , unlike them regarding hungarians ... but i absolutely do n't agree with labeling the entire country as extremists because there was a decision he did n't fancy ... and playing innocent victims while they had their hands dirty the entire time . 
  shut up !, 
  tbh early hungarians mixed with the local population extensively quite early on , one of the reasons our genetic composition is so similar to the surrounding peoples . 
  ah that rings a bell . 
  thanks !, 
  me neither , i found [ this ] ( http://www.johndclare.net/league_of_nations4_disarmament.htm#preparatory_commission ) source however , claiming 99,086 troops for germany in 1926 . 
  as apparently they have n't withdrawn from the disarmament conference [ until 1933 ] ( http://www.johndclare.net/roadtowwii3_rearmament.htm ) i 'd assume this figure , which seems really low , stayed more or less the same until that point at least . 
  [ how could we ? 
  ( among blind , the one eyed rules ) neat !, 
  yeah they certainly were ambitious , maybe a bit too much . 
  though early '30s germany was n't much of a threat so i 'd say they had some ground to it as well . 
  where did i hear that name before ?
