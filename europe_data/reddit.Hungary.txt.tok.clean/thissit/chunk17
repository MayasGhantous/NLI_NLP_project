  \u2610 yes \u2610 no \u2611 can into, 
  well i mean it 's one thing what it should be and another what we have actual data about . 
  well i should be offended and upset because you just accused and labeled my country but i checked and see you have this agenda going so it 's kind of meh . 
  i 'll give a few quick pointers for you becaue i ca n't stand this ... but people so clouded are pointless to argue with at the end . 
  i know you 'll deny this with the entirety of your being but i 'd suggest you check up on your retaliatory szekler killings after the vienna decision and several massacres against hungarians during the '48 revolution while you are at it or the targeted hungarian killings of horea and closca . 
  or the forced romanianification of our heritage after the war detaining people trying to speak hungarian for example . 
  [ the list goes on . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t313vid_2ua ) you are not innocent . 
  but it 's so convenient to play the victim , is n't it ? 
  after all we lost the war since only romania managed to switch from the nazi side in time ... 
  oh so that 's how they teach it over there ? 
  that 's worrying . 
  i wonder if his uhas name came from [ juh\u00e1sz ] ( http://mek.oszk.hu/01900/01903/html/cd7/kepek/eletmod/em122km5681.jpg ) ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ [ maybe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miros%c5%82aw_hermaszewski ), 
   you hung * a * ry ? 
  oh god i thought we were safe for once, 
  no , who 's that ? 
  ( i think the second interpretation is closer to the hungarian meaning than the first , first can be `` kibaszni '' as well ), 
  i 'm unsure if that 's correct from the speech context though . 
  he was talking about and to their party/coalition regarding the past few years ' governance . 
  oh right , fair point . 
  where did you get those figures from ? 
  hungary is [ 16.7 % non religious and 1.5 % atheist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_hungary ) according to [ the 2011 census ] ( http://www.ksh.hu/docs/hun/xftp/idoszaki/nepsz2011/nepsz_orsz_2011.pdf ) ( 23 . page ) . 
  i see you 're an abstainer . 
  mind you he just admitted ( to his colleagues in a closed meeting , not intentionally to the public at all ) lying for his/their entire term . 
  i guess not romania because they managed to switch sides in time . 
  also , reading up on bulgaria they `` only '' got invaded by the ussr apparently as they never opposed any of germany 's actions ? 
  so yeah you 're right , we were the only ones besides poland then . 
  [ ( should ) never forget ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_panzerfaust ), 
  because orb\u00e1n needs to * deal with it * . 
  or they could just call up the greeks < :o), 
  those things in # 1 make the coach kinda cozy though . 
  funnily enough hitler was concerned about a polish invasion early 1930s iirc . 
   first the nazis than the soviets you can say that about pretty much all of ee . 
  means `` into the seed '' in hungarian ), 
  well he certainly did n't mean to , at least publicly not ... , 
  i thought they just decided on a whim during afternoon tea . 
  * g\u00f6tterfunken intensifies *, 
  let the others fight !, 
  yeah of course . 
  the left completely destroyed themselves the last few terms they were in power . 
  * for those downvoting me , [ take a look at this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%90sz%c3%b6d_speech ), 
  not really . 
  several ( primarily the elderly i would hope ) side with them . 
  now that 's a clickbait title if i ever saw one . 
  top says `` 99 % rejects govt . 
  `` felbaszni '' means `` to fuck with someone '' , `` to make them mad '' . 
  source : i know some hungarian words, 
  * all of it *, 
  they might ask you a question or two if you travel with a mirv in your rucksack though . 
  sorry , * civitas fidelisssima * should remain ours !, 
  `` yes to europe , no to borders '' 100 % makes sense once you have a proper preventative mechanism ( that does n't start in the middle of the eu ) for such migrations to occur . 
  that they played into the illegal migrant 's hand by willfully misinterpreting what happened , ie . 
  that he pushed his child and wife onto the tracks to start wailing and posing dramatically to show how much he 's being oppressed ? 
  the bbc are n't dummies , they knew full well what was he trying to achieve . 
  ( it 's not about the pulling back [ of the policeman mind you , that migrant you mention was * pushing * her on the tracks not * pulling * her ... ] . 
  pulling them back is the logical response to a nutjob pushing his family onto the railroad tracks which you can see the police start doing towards the end . 
  it 's the willful misinterpretation of the bbc that * should be * outrageous and unacceptable . ), 
  [ so you 're telling me they are n't pushing an agenda ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sv3oxglnvy ), 
   road , fields , river , clouds , blue sky . 
  checks out !, 
  the mistake you make in your assumtion is that you actually believe they are asylum seekers/refugees when they are welfare migrants on a shopping trip of countries . 
  you 're not wrong with that * sick edge * though . 
  but is n't that the catch , that barely any registered though ? 
  same with hungary . 
  we probably only have more registered because more tried to pass through early on . 
  alright england . 
  * ahem *, 
  that does n't disprove anything i said though . 
  collapse ? 
  probably not . 
  weakening ? 
  certainly . 
  not primarily because of oil but just look at what 's happening to the us . 
  they are still the biggest players on the world stage . 
  but their influence is waning day by day . 
  when will we stop using refugee and migrant interchangeably ? 
  especially frustrating labeling illegal immigrants as refugees . 
  oh it 's about bottled water ? 
  i barely ever drink that , tap water quality is really good here ( in budapest at least ) . 
  it 's people like you . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ unlesss ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ were n't ^ ^ ^ ^ serious ^ ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ ^ this, 
   why ? 
  because they are in power, 
  that 's frenchist, 
  \\ # 36 ( bosnia ) looks pretty damn cool, 
   it spins 360o why, 
  its full name is * kacsacs\u0151r\u0171 eml\u0151s * ( duck-beaked mammal ), 
  boats have feelings too, 
  was referring to [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cod_wars ), 
  prepare for war iceland, 
  not sure if you got more serbian territory or if serbia got some of yours . 
  would you prefer it to continue sabotaging further eu integration ? 
  time flies when you 're having fun, 
  lol did n't even notice the clock until now, 
  why ? 
  you just use 1:1 in that case . 
  they think with [ fusion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wendelstein_7-x ),
