  i agree , giving criminals fewer options is pretty illiberal [ .

  good thing those quebecois keep your language alive !, 
  every true french citizen has a miniature maginot-line as their front fence . 
  no one says greece should n't reject them as well . 
  no reason to blame for finally doing something about illegal immigration . 
   many times the nearest harbour is malta [ are you sure about that ? 
  ] ( https://i.redd.it/32ttswuj034z.png ), 
  it 's history came to life , really cool . 
  oh it 's one of [ these ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6gki8u/romania_is_so_proud_that_it_is_part_of_the_eu/?st=j3svo3kf&amp;sh=0cebfb38 ) posts again < :o), 
  but the resources and the manpower ? 
  latvia 's like `` we got this '', 
  i counted 798 ( + -6 ) of them, 
  has n't this always been like that though ? 
  we are n't ready to reveal the secret weapon yet . 
  this reminds me , `` coach '' came from the hungarian word `` kocsi '' for a horse carriage iirc ? 
  so many tourists , they even replaced the shop signs, 
  some finnish to hungarian translations : battle armor wagon -  battle car ( harc + kocsi ) ground ball -  ground ball ( f\u00f6ld + goly\u00f3 ) flight support vessel -  mothership ( anya + haj\u00f3 ) flight machine -  flying machine ( rep\u00fcl\u0151 + g\u00e9p ) horn snout -  horn snouted ( orr + szarv\u00fa ) iron road -  iron road ( vas + \u00fat ), 
  nice to hear . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ okay ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ let 's ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ go ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ far ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ;p, 
  so strange to see berlin `` below '' budapest . 
  i 'd assume due to location ? 
  i was always surprised by the relative lack of skyscrapers in frankfurt . 
  also this does n't feel as dull as many claim the city to be ( ofc enhanced but still ) . 
   and i was at a family gathering lol talk about bad timing . 
  why , he prefers men ? 
  reminds me of the coreldraw logo/scene ( damn i have n't heard that name in ages before googling it now ) . 
  greenpeace would approve, 
   but let us just say no to helping the first time we are asked to do something are you saying that there were no other matters in which we supported the eu desision the 13 years we 've been members so far ? 
  strange rhetoric there . 
  inb4 they piggyback this for more orwellian proposals . 
   hungarians spending tons of resources and actually doing a good job patrolling the borders ? 
  i like how we got actually shunned for this . 
  damn us for trying to control the situation in that clusterfuck while millions went on a shopping tour of eu countries ** illegally ** . 
  some of ee was under constant attack the past years or so for not bending over that easily last i checked . 
  about macron 's / eu 's method , you 'll achieve nothing against this general mindset with attacks . 
  one party will have to ease up on certain points if they want to work this out and i doubt those defiant countries will be the ones to do so . 
  seems reasonable, 
  that 's just showing off your superb signs is n't it ? 
  by the last one everyone gets the point . 
  yeah but last i heard it was uncontrollable but thx for the hint < 3, 
  damn , so much untapped potential . 
  how did it stop spreading ? 
  see , we have built-in pump tracks . 
  get on our level , hollandia,

  i know , i was just referring to the exposure . 
  if one of `` them '' surfaced there 's probably more . 
  if there 's one even on youtube , good chance there are others unknown . 
  [ found one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px_m6wes8gy&amp;t=19s ), 
  that 's what i was referring to , yeah . 
  til taking pictures = murder, 
   people very close to me have been outragous and disappointed about me quitting catholicism did they threaten killing you tho besides , these people are n't even leaving islam . 
  in germany ... nice having such tolerant people in the heart of the eu . 
  some really want to make finno-ugric happen :d, 
  because there is no such a thing as continuing a thread . 
  nice * edge * tho, 
  maybe using proper terms for your argument worked better . 
  or maybe not because ` racist ' just has that special edge ? 
  so in like 50 years ' time ? 
  there 's no way hungary would leave on their own . 
  we may be delusional at times but not * that * much . 
  `` could you guys move pls we have touristing to do '', 
  united in diversity , after all, 
  the fuck, 
  well the netherlands is basically coruscant so there 's that . 
  i 'm not sure what political affiliation has to do with music . 
  he did n't conduct differently because of that . 
  i suppose so , for comparison hungary has 3154 . 
  dividing total area with # of settlements you get 24.61 km ^ 2 / settlement for luxembourg and 29.5 for hungary which is a 19.87 % difference . 
  oh i only meant that karajan was an excellent choice . 
  i really like his attitude towards music . 
  why would you remove our coa , op ? 
  it looked sweet . 
  til there are [ 105 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_communes_of_luxembourg_by_population ) towns/villages in luxembourg . 
  the main opposition party is the amalgamate of the imploded left : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unity_ ( hungary ), 
  what are you supposed to say , east-polish-lithuanian commonwealth ? 
  what a cunt . 
  in the thread yesterday they talked about him getting 3.5 years though , at least . 
  i thought i did n't have to use / s for this , it 's so obviously bad . 
  `` it is the sole remaining fighter base of the state '', 
   karajan you know your stuff [ .

  `` i liked the guy '' * thunderous applause *, 
  diy revolt, 
  i guess / u/verylateish meant that everyone forgets cyprus except turkey ? 
  though i 'm pretty sure greece is well aware as well :p, 
  what 's the point of counting failed together with completed attacks ? 
  why would we have to change the name at all ? 
  you 're right i 'm sure they only asked proper dumb people . 
  for anyone wondering about why there are no real alternatives at the moment ... 
  the left had several terms to completely [ destroy their credibility ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%90sz%c3%b6d_speech ) before . 
  nothing decent emerged so far , only rebrands with the same people . 
  oh man , look at those ugly eurosceptic hungarians being 2 % below average . 
  wearing an `` eu-colour '' ( blue ) dress and a hat with `` eu flag-colours '' ( blue fabric and yellow buttoned flowers ) . 
  while poking fingers . 
  just fyi we also tried to switch sides but our attempt failed ... that 's why nazi germany invaded us and installed that radical sz\u00e1lasi ... and why horthy had to go into exile . 
  i 'd guess because czechia and slovakia think primarily in eu terms , poland and hungary have more eurosceptic tendencies .
