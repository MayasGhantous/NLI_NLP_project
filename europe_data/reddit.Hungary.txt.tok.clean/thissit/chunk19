  the whole group was created to aid cooperation towards eu integration anyway . 
  they have [ their own group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/craiova_group ) anyway , however not many ( not even some romanians ) are particularly aware of it . 
  so do you claim slovakia ? 
  wild fasces appear . 
   hungary , love that cross d'aww , love you too op, 
  hold our beer, 
  wow that 's only 30 km/h slower than the [ maglev speed record ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shinkansen#maglev_trains ) and a good 100 km/h faster than shinkansen . 
  oh gotcha , thanks !, 
  why is italy emphasized in the last panel ? 
  now i will just because , op . 
  tbh the [ prussian one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prussia ) was pretty cool . 
  it 's there just hiding behind the flag, 
  he actually did it , the absolute madman, 
  you say that as if they were n't trying from the 1400-1500s ... 
  you 're giving them way too much credit, 
  the bait 's too obvious tho :d, 
  then that 's 0 * in romania * then is n't it ? 
  burkina faso sshould have that +1 instead . 
  0 * attacks * though ,, 
  as for hungary , we are n't conspiring with aliens or worshipping ancient greek gods yet . 
  `` but have you seen that other guy '', 
  they probably have a date for the next time they 'll add a few years to the adoption date . 
  looks neat but seems more like a road than a track to me . 
  fun fact : margaret island ( in the upper left ) is almost exactly 5km round the running track . 
  a piece of *, 
  looks really cool though . 
  and the fact that it 's an ancient roman one just multiplies that by * alot * . 
  may very well be . 
  [ we 're used to it though .

  same for me albeit i have to agree with / u/istencsaszar that these add little to no value to the threads . 
  they may add some spice to the comments in general but i doubt that 's needed in / r/europe where the comment sections generally are quite interesting/entertaining by themselves . 
  such bots are mostly just noise here tbh . 
  hm from what i can tell in hungary we do n't have any resentment towards nowadays ' turks because ottomans occupied the middle of the country for 140ish years . 
  we do remember the period but the focus is more on heroic resistance than hating ottomans really . 
  we even keep your legacy well maintained as artifacts of the past ( eg .

  i could in theory see westerners thinking of ottomans as boogeymen that time but honestly i do n't feel like they actually cared until you started getting close to vienna , mostly they just let us handle you until we could barely hold on any longer ... as for recent notions i 'm really not sure . 
  from what i can tell you are the most progressive of contemporary islamic states ( props to atat\u00fcrk ) but still plenty different from european culture and values ( maybe not the folk in cities but the vast majority of the population ) . 
  erdogan did not help you with this pr thing that 's for sure . 
  why would it matter what you label it as ? 
  that does n't change flawed practices . 
  your comment reeks of insecurity . 
  monetized prisons is still a ridiculous concept for me somehow , just like a monetized school system .

   turkey does have an awful pr though , true . 
  agree , it 's a bit the same with us although we do n't have it nearly as bad as turkey here tbh . 
  i mean that 's a convenient excuse but there 's giving up on the whole thing and there 's damage control . 
  i think my comment remains relevant , it all comes down to determination really . 
  i also think that you guys could step it up a bit . 
  take a note from romania 's book . 
  their pr is excellent . 
  anything that 's marginally relevant and is a pro-eu move you 'll see flooding the sub , sometimes to the point of utter cheesiness even . 
  now i 'm not saying that you should repeat [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6gki8u/romania_is_so_proud_that_it_is_part_of_the_eu/?st=j3svo3kf&amp;sh=0cebfb38 ) but i remember [ that lgbt post from yesterday ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6holbu/lgbt_protest_in_turkey/?st=j40clfu4&amp;sh=6d773f59 ) , someone with a turkish flair [ posted a bunch of pictures ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6holbu/lgbt_protest_in_turkey/dj00m34/?st=j418ms2z&amp;sh=47cf4944 ) from the rally which showed a vastly different overall perspective . 
  what i 'm saying is that you could 've posted those pictures to the sub prior with a pro-eu tone and not try to save face in the comments , after the controversial post reached high . 
  you too need to be active * and * proactive if you want to change the sentiment to be more reasonable in this very sub , generally online or anywhere really . 
  oh you 're right with cyprus , did n't think of it like that . 
  as for the location , i could say that the geopolitical location of cyprus and georgia is significantly different and would be somewhat of a far fetch in georgia 's case but then again the eu have territories over the pond in sa as well . 
  less hostile environment certainly , but you see . 
  as for `` deserving '' european integration on cultural basis , there ca n't be many questions about that . 
   south ossetia would be considered an occupied territory of a nato country , which is normally a casus belli maybe if they tried to come to an agreement prior but i doubt russia would want any of that if they ( likely ) understood that it would be for a seamless nato integration . 
  it 's a tough call . 
  i believe the project needs a few calatizators before people start to form a common identity . 
  in a region with such rich history it wo n't be a fast process . 
  i consider myself a hungarian with europhile attitude . 
  i really wish they could be integrated into nato at least . 
  eu is a bit of a strech due to location . 
  what would happen with south ossetia 's case though ? 
  so this one differs from the one of yesterday in that territorial waters are marked ? 
  saw similar in downtown sofia 10ish years ago . 
  0 +1 +16 +3 here , i 'd say that 's pretty good !, 
  bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy ...  welcome and keep the great work of current mods up !, 
  ok what 's with the overly anti-turkey propaganda/sentiment in this sub lately ? 
  to the point of misinterpreting things deliberately , op . 
  as if some people were trying to push an agenda really hard . 
  hmm from what i can tell people who play paradox games tend to have a more universal taste within the looser strategic genre . 
  at least the few i 'm subbed to ( which may very well be the two i linked you ) do , none of which i 'd consider a hardcore paradox player so i 'm afraid not . 
  hehe . 
  honestly i do n't really watch galciv but both [ him ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/marbozir/playlists ) and [ quill18 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/quill18/playlists ) have several stellaris series , a paradox title similar to galciv with a pinch of alien genocide and genetical experimenting for good measure . 
   hungary on the image did not appear at all , since nobody remembers its existence , the user thinks . 
  they mentioned us !, 
  we are relevant ! + !, 
  funny to read references while watching marb [ ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eebyh52gc0 ) s hoi series . 
   right , because he could afford tanning . 
  [ i blame this guy for this conspiracy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wyufear.jpg ), 
  yeah i 'm sure that 's the sole reason someone can ask a question ... come on now . 
  may with that face of compassion, 
  * insert igloo joke here *, 
  yeah initially . 
  they hit that a bit before then adjusted for his head as well . 
  wonder how would our relation to turkey differ if , say , greece held the straits . 
  ( not saying that 's the reason for caring/not caring about certain people and actions , it 's just popped in my mind ), 
  others in the thread said that he did go blind afterwards ... those on the other end of the hose should be held accountable but i 'm not getting my hopes up in this case . 
  you can even see that they were repeatedly adjusting the jet to aim for his head ... that 's fucked up . 
  oh i remember this from holidays in greece , many of the elderly were playing with them . 
  got one for myself as well , actually quite fun to mess about with and you only need a single hand to .
