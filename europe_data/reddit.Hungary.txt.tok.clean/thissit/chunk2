  true , states are so intertwined in modern economics that it 's really difficult to distance ourselves from certain , significant , players . 
  it might 'd take a real russian scare with reduced us support before people start thinking about putting self defence ahead of economic interests . 
  but when would that happen without a war ? 
  it could be that the west just got too accustomed to being served by the us . 
  it 's certainly easier to develop without having to worry about and spend on self defence . 
  but that mentailty is like a tepid soup , nothing decent will come of it on its own . 
  i would be more worried if they did n't show russia that we are prepared and ready to respond . 
  * si vis pacem , para bellum * - you ca n't affect the russians with harsh words ... only actions . 
   to add a military component , maybe even a warrior-like strategic culture , is contradicting a serious part of the eu 's roots and makes many people rather uncomfortable about the very notion . 
  but what is our alternative ? 
  to be at the mercy of the us all the time ? 
  how can you create a sense of togetherness if you are impotent in even defending yourselves alone ? 
  if we want people to take the european project seriously , we have to take the bigger steps when sensible too . 
  the driving culture feels quite different there . 
  much more , um . . dynamic . 
  feels like it 's going down a un slope . 
   implying that the united states was behind the uprising lol . 
  that 's what we asked/hoped for , instead we got nice words . 
  nah it 's cool, 
  * shrug * attila was cool af . 
  not for pansies though . 
  and amon amarth, 
  kaliningrad as well though . 
  live stronk die young ... or something . 
   `` we can confirm that the five crew on board are deceased , '' they may have been expanding the article , do n't remember seeing this . 
  fun times !, 
  damn ... who were the officials involved ? 
  the former , though i should not underestimate the power of populism and propaganda for sure . 
  v4 flag concept ? 
  that 'd never succeed . 
  most people realize that the eu is way better than the other alternative , russia . 
  i 'd imagine the uk did much more for reu than us . 
  oohhh ... well i guess it does n't help that all i can see is blue on there . 
  the upper segment of the building is coloured in the wrong order ( see my flair ) . 
  i think he means that the flag is upside down . 
  your alternative would be ? 
  puny nation states to be exploited by superpowers ? 
  ikr , trianon aka ` double my country ' button . 
  holy shit , now that 's a real difference . 
  fun facts , ohio is [ 24.8 % ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=116096%2f93030 ) larger and [ 17.8 % ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=11613423%2f9855571 ) more populous than hungary . 
   the more urban kids fuck in a a `` kelderbox '' romantic af, 
  was about to ask , reading down to his comment i have n't seen anything that 'd justify losing one 's shit about this much . 
  insecurities ? 
  it was the perfect song for a game themed like civ . 
  well they did try to teach me german for four years in gymnasium . 
  diesels smoke as well . 
   and citizens of eu countries who have made scotland their home would again be able to vote what does this mean ? 
  residing in scotland for t amount of time at the time of the referendum ? 
  yeah ... nope . 
  sure , for old times ' sake , 
  whoops . 
  it would n't make too much sense , would it ? 
  switzerland is such a small country . 
  the whole point is to make the system efficient , exactly the opposite of dividing the airspace between tiny central/eastern european countries . 
  even if switzerland is but an observer of the eu project . 
  * edit : whoosh, 
  this certainly is n't what it 's supposed to be but 516 ^ 18 sounds like a lot of airports . 
  to infinity and beyond, 
  reminds me of critical mass , there were tens of thousands ( [ in 2008 , 80k ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/f%c3%a1jl:critical_mass_2008_h%c5%91s%c3%b6k_tere.jpg ) ) of riders every half a year [ in hungary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:3a_cm070922.jpg ) , due to which the govts improved/expanded cycling paths and infrastructure in the capital and other cities . 
  [ it 's still active for a more cyclist friendly environment ] ( http://criticalmass.hu/ ) and it 's generally accepted that the movement reached its main goals by 2013 . 
  my nipples explode with delight !, 
  is there an extended version of this somewhere ? 
  i 'd like to see where hungarians stand . 
  although a per capita one would probably work better . 
  apology for poor english when were you when john lenin dies ? 
  i was sat at home eating smegma butter when pjotr ring ` john is kill ' ` no ', 
  nature says hi , puny humans, 
  train wrecks erupt ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding, 
  could work once the scandinavian bloc leaves as well . 
  spain-austria-hungary ? 
  why not indeed . 
  jolly cooperation !, 
  [ compare : king of thailand ] ( https://i.imgur.com/fnsdgcn.jpg ), 
  i 'm somewhat surprised by japan , thought they 'd be better off compared to the eu . 
  [ but of course ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miros%c5%82aw_hermaszewski ), 
  spongebob 's seen better days . 
   wow , this is nice . 
  its not often a leaver with a british flag gets upvotes . 
  we tend to end up in the minus range and the bottom of the page . 
  quality discussion is quality discussion . 
  you 've made a solid and articulate point , actually made me look at brexit from a different angle . 
  thank you !, 
  i wonder what decent plans our politicians have in mind if any , really . 
  * well that rustled some jimmies, 
  at this point i 'm just preparing myself to euro parity . 
  what would this long run be ? 
  40 years ? 
  maybe the usd is strenghtening as it appears more likely that the buffoon wo n't get elected . 
  lowest possible depth of the glorious hole of `` we 'll show ya '' . 
  ~ ~ skyrim ~ ~ cyprus belongs to the ~ ~ nords ~ ~ turks ? 
  \\ #worthit, 
  how about some extended rczespopolita ? 
  maybe we can get the v4 in on that for a vertical kuk . 
  hungary would be bloody snow on green grass ? 
  comment ** s **, 
  russia would disagree . 
  * reversing intensifies *, 
   flair checks out holy shit how are you still oblivious to the irony in your comments . 
  hand it to greece .
