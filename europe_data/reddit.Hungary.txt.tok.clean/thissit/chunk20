  [ vi must deel with them . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfqonttydfi ), 
  you 're quite an oracle for your age though . 
   the factual errors you speak off ... you mean when we make a typo on the screen and did n't notice it ? 
  i was thinking more along the lines of [ confusing the eu with europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6l_a4cy6ki ) to be honest . 
  that was kind of a `` heads up '' that made me stop watching so soon . 
  as i said i did n't watch many of your videos but most of what i did had however at least some errors in them . 
  i understand that you are n't a 16-people team but i think you 'll agree that too frequent inaccuracies question the reliabilty of a medium , which is especially vital in this `` knowledge hub '' niche . 
  nevertheless , i 'm glad that you took the time to respond and i hope your channel will improve for the better and that you 'll prioritise quality before all . 
  i 'm all for this fairly recent surge of channels like kurzgesagt , reallifelore or wendover productions ; hope i 'll feel obliged to subscribe to yours as a * quality * content provider in the future as well . 
  they polled a different demographic ( / s ? ), 
  pretty sure / u/maultaschenman references [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6gki8u/romania_is_so_proud_that_it_is_part_of_the_eu/?st=j3svo3kf&amp;sh=0cebfb38 ) absolutely not cheesy post from a few days ago . 
  * a part of, 
  exactly . 
  i 've seen some of this guy 's vids and several have factual errors and/or wrong/insufficient data . 
  you ca n't really become another kurzgesagt with half-assed content , even if your art is similar , i 'm sorry ... 
  what 's the point of comparing single eu members with the entire us ? 
  if there 's no sufficient data just leave the point out . 
  * `` it 's coming right at meee '' *, 
  [ i think it 's just you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungaroring ), 
  `` left behind '' or `` fucked itself infinitely more prior '' ? 
  the circlejerk certainly likes to paint us as anti-eu or anti-everything human and civilised basically , though . 
  so apparently the entire track is about avoiding that forest in the middle . 
  austria-hungary and polish-lithuanian commonwealth i guess ? 
   wikipedia yearly edits     video uploads on youtube wtf ? 
  alliance of convenient locations, 
  [ quite beautiful indeed ] ( http://i.imgur.com/skda0dk.png ), 
  for the excitement factor, 
  none of those three do, 
  looks like vomit . 
  it would feel like trying too hard though . 
  that was supposed to be our line !, 
  got ta get another balkans foothold besides serbia i guess . 
  i guess she enjoys head quite a bit . 
  reminds me a bit of hillary trying to pretend she was n't a robot ... :d it did n't come naturally to her at all . 
  did he come from spain/italy ? 
  / u/turtledragon12 only bothers with alternative facts \u2122 which suit them . 
  longing for that sweet release, 
   edit : after reading the article ~ ~ carefully ~ ~ let 's not pretend, 
  nice pocket middle east you have there on your island . 
  as things are going , you 'll get just that in due time . 
  is n't their only real option to not play ? 
  they ca n't possibly get through with a proper separation in 2 years ' time . 
  do n't make us nostalgic hrvatska ... :3, 
  also * regno di napoli * , * srbija * and * polska * . 
  maybe who made the map translated everything in their native language that they know of ? 
  there are other inconsistencies for example using `` hungarn '' on the map and `` hongrie '' with the emblem on the sides . 
  this style is just so visually appealing for some reason . 
  informative yet not boring and feels clean at the same time . 
  thank you for enlightening me !, 
  are you implying that immigrant boats sink on sighting rescue vessels ? 
  uh , erm ... asking for a friend ? 
  hungary was the first to actually try and solve the problem of ** illegal immigrants ** on the main route during the crisis , and i 'd like to emphasize this , because apparently it 's all fine for westerners to be an illegal immigrant , so long that they can pat their backs about how humanitarian and high minded they are . 
  this attitude will lead you nowhere because in the coming decades , as the african population will continue to boom , there will be even more and more seemingly desperate people trying to cross into europe . 
  how long until you 'll say enough is enough and try to stop the flow ? 
  when it 'll be too late ? 
  i 'm sure you 'll find a way to blame us for your failure again . 
  how about trying to be pro-active in those countries ? 
  have the plan of not allowing ** illegal ** immigrants into the eu , then educating their populace that it 's not beneficiary to attempt the crossing because they wo n't see any benefits from it ? 
  how about trying not to act like there are civil wars on the northern coast of africa , that these people are so desperate to live in our democratic utopias or whatever instead of realising that they 're trying to exploit your inability to grow a spine and stand up to your well understood interests ? 
  how about coming back down to earth and stand on the ground to try and solve problems intead of bending over for the flow and blaming others for it , relaying responsibility ? 
  i 'm pretty sure they 'll eventually get the memo when the big grey boat that 's supposed to grab their hand and lead them to paradise does n't exactly do that but force them to turn back . 
  of course , and this aligns with your view , this also needs education programmes in those specific countries , to help them realise that it 's not worth the effort in the first place . 
  but if we do n't even have proper plans on how to deal with these people when we actually find them trying to illegally cross , we just fish them out in the name of humanity and set them out into europe , the situation wo n't ever get solved ; it will only worsen . 
  if they stood more firmly against those migrants they would n't risk their lives to cross in the first place ... as it stands now they just go all-in and hope to reach far enough that italy/etc will just hand them a free ride across , into europe . 
   -  it becomes impossible to increase workload further this is the point up until you 'll see what i 'm talking about . 
  it happens later than what you 'd expect . 
  how much for one of those little islands ? 
  but in order for that to happen there has to be a severe sortage for extended periods of time . 
  and with severe shortage , there will no doubt be a workload increase . 
  the first step 's always to try and squeeze as much value out of the workers as possible . 
  if that does n't solve your problems , you squeeze more . 
  if even then you 're in the shitter , you might start * considering * making sacrifices . 
  but remember , during all this , your workforce continues to suffer . 
  there 's no fairytale scenario really . 
  how do you convince the insecure and stubborn elderly about their viability though ? 
  very concerned , even so since there are no capable alternatives . 
  the left had 2-3 terms to drag their own names into the dirt prior to this unfortunately ... and the liberals were their allies . 
  if that increases , so will workload . 
  it was so huge they did n't even bother to add proper footnotes to their graphs . 
   finally they 'll pay the consequences of our incompetence, 
  compared to the dup ? 
   one people , one parliament , one queen theresa 10/10, 
  two years to the greatest fuckup of it all . 
  yeah it 's just showing a count on two in hungary as well . 
  victory sign is shown with the opposite side of the hand out . 
  finally got the * real * answer . 
  cheers !, 
  so ... no reason ? 
  apart from being wrong , you 're right . 
  why would you put a window there though ? 
  france is just choke full of these amazing places . 
  wonder why so many only care about paris . 
   dropping it would mean going against their current platform , which is hard brexit . 
  say goodbye to those ukip votes you gained does it really matter from her perspective though ? 
  those seats are now their seats , not ukip 's . 
  unless they plan on calling another snap , i do n't see how would she care ... 
  i mean , surely she does n't expect to partake in and win another election after this disaster anyways ? 
  i guess it 's a matter of how we look at it is n't it . 
  the hungarian crown was a continuous and independent entity , the diet has existed throughout , even when the kingdom was in three , royal hungary - ottoman occupation - transylvania parts .
