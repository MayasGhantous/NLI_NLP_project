   in the early stages , the lands that were ruled by the habsburg hungarian kings were regarded both as `` the kingdom of hungary '' and `` royal hungary '' . 
  [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] royal hungary was the symbol of the continuity of formal law [ 5 ] after the ottoman occupation , because it could preserve its legal traditions . 
  [ 6 ] however in general it was de facto a habsburg province . 
  [ 7 ] the hungarian nobility forced vienna to admit that hungary was a special unit of the habsburg lands and had to be ruled in conformity with her own special laws . 
  one could argue that austria treated us as an occupied province after the 1848 events until forming the dual monarchy in 1867 , however , so you could very well be right . 
  no worries , i did n't mean it like that , it 's just a personal thing . 
  i would feel like i 'm handing my hand over if i was n't grabbing the other 's from under or the side . 
  nothing more to it . 
  hey at least that 's a new one . 
  reminds me of that joke with the pope and the random guy that everyone knows . 
  wow you 're right . 
  just checked and was not aware how ( relatively ) young several european countries are . 
  just compared it with hungary being 1000-1100 years old yet still some look at us as `` outsiders '' . 
  my apologies . 
  `` no coastline '' countries appear to be coloured one of the lower category ones at first glance . 
  especially confusing with all those countries along the mediterranean being the same colour . 
  * in post-brexit britain there 's no reason to be merry * ^ ^ ^ disclaimer : ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ joke, 
  wait , portugal is only 900 years old ? 
  really ? 
  i would feel the opposite .

  [ you 've got quite a record to beat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungary_men%27s_national_water_polo_team ) , 
  and european !, 
  ca n't blame them , beating a two-times world cup 2nd team must 've felt good , 
  thanks to andorra for sparing us . 
  congrats on understanding what happened . 
  looks like we are back to the utter shit form we 've been in for decades ... was a good run !, 
  may i ask what would your plans be if you become independent ? 
  would you seek to join eu again , for example ? 
  yup , goes to the castle district ; [ view ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ghobuul.jpg ) from the chain bridge . 
  * enters existential crisis *, 
  well at least they say strong and proud * european * country , with eu colours ? 
  agreed ; needs more green . 
  they got the tune for that from this yeah . 
  alright england . 
  [ speaking of swahili ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzousx-ik-4 ), 
  i like how people assume that only may is rotten to the core . 
  [ terrorists win ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5cbkhybvt8 ), 
  when the ice cream licks back ... 
  i would refer to [ this sketch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvkiwjnepny ), 
  refugees , sure . 
  * illegal * migrants ? 
  no thanks . 
  i do n't necessarily agree with the colouring on this one . 
  is n't the whole point of the system is to help countries lagging behind ? 
  if so then it 's a positive thing , not a negative one . 
  i like your optimism . 
  ( just a friendly note guys , instead of downvoting him , maybe it 's better to reason for your point of view or explain if you have relevant knowledge about the subject ), 
  no ckii player 's comfortable without a good dose of bordergore . 
  well there 's an argument for distinguishing between poorer countries in your relative vicinity and far off in the middle east . 
  yeah that 's a smart strategy . 
  not really relevant for the eu though . 
  we are open for pu offers :3, 
   4 ) eu is seen as a bunch of posh bureaucrats who don ` t know anything about norwegian issues what are norway 's issues ? 
  alright voltaire, 
  our eu project game is strong . 
  you mean [ like this ? 
  good on them for being able to overcome negative sentiments . 
  he 's about as american in essence as dirt from my left shoe though . 
  without turkey in , russia 's black sea presence would n't be ( as ) contained . 
  where them colours at , op ? 
  it would also give a green light for future russian influence in the region . 
  sounds more or less akin to the hungarian president . 
  unfortunately it seems like it 's a convenient tool for politicians to rally people for their agenda . 
  i wo n't put much faith in them solving this issue openly and with a good/honest mind behind . 
  it will probably take a long time or significant positive events before this issue gets settled . 
  alright i wrote a long paragraph on this then realized it did n't have much to do with the essence of your question . 
  not sure why we hold transylvania more dear to ourselves than the felvid\u00e9k.it might be ( and i mean no offense here ) that slovaks had a more distinct culture than romanians throughout ? 
  for example we had a specific word for slovaks : t\u00f3thok with many of our poets/writers referring to them on various occasions , describing their culture etc. 
  iirc there 's not even an artifact of romanian language until the 1600s . 
  there 's just nothing that stands out for us as `` romanian '' until your nationalistic awakening in the 1800s , apart from the shepherds in the hills ( again meaning no offense ) . 
  if i was to summarize the sentiment towards you , we kind of feel like you occupied/took the region with our heritage , our past and claim it yours , trying to discredit/dismiss any and all that is/was hungarian then and there . 
  this could be the essence of iit . 
  we can argue for and against it but that would just cause another `` fun '' thread i believe . 
  i think it uses white for uninhabited/scarcely inhabited areas . 
  assuming it 's not the agenda for most uk politicians . 
  iirc the hungarian government settled such a deal with the uk about hungarians living there . 
  ca n't recall when and how though . 
  i was not aware of # 2 , that 'd be quite a hassle to change indeed . 
  thank you for helping me understand your point of view . 
   we could just agree to disagree , kinda . 
  that would be the best really . 
  like adults . 
  well then i assume the only reasonable course of action is to hijack the damn thing . 
  you talk about the present . 
  he talks about the past . 
  his argument is valid as * [ then ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/ethnographic_map_of_hungary_1910_by_teleki_carte_rouge.jpg ) * there were 32 % hungarians living in transylvania ( among germans and other peoples ) . 
  it 's not what you call a fair and reasonable settlement . 
   and a turkish boat with tourists saved them but the migrants decided to hijack the boat ok what the actual fuck . 
  for some reason i put moldova n-ne of that [ northern part ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/kingdom_of_romania_%281890%29.svg ) in my mind . 
  95 % sure 95 % of hungarians do n't believe in this nonsense so do n't worry ... none of the people i know either . 
  i know . 
  i wish this thing between our two peoples just end on a whim as we should be striving for working together in the region , not scoffing at each other . 
  such only benefits enemies of the european project that seek to divide . 
  on the other hand there are n't any signs of romania wanting to ease on the situation either . 
  for example what holds you back so much in granting autonomy for seklerland ? 
  it 's something that would n't require much resignation on your part . 
  and they 've been there for a thousand years with distinct culture and history . 
  i 'm not saying hungary is so welcoming either . 
  just that there 's no real efforts on easing the situation ( which , though , not as severe as such threads and discussions make it look like . . we are n't a second balkans in this regard at least . . people are able to discuss it mostly politely usually ) .
