  well that 's just silly . 
  that ` you '' was aimed towards a general attitude i tend to see from romanians , not you specifically . 
  sorry for the ambiguity on my part . 
  yeah bucovina 's name did n't come to mind , that 's the northern part of the historic romanian territories is n't it ( just south of moldova or something around that iirc ) ? 
  so then you can understand our attitude prior . 
  let 's be real , it 's quite easy to play benevolent and forgiving after having your country doubled on the expense of that other one . 
  of course you 're fine with the state of things . 
  so were we . 
  that argument does n't invalidate his though . 
  i mean he did just that for most of wallachia 's history ... :p, 
  ah so it 's okay when these things happen to your favor but it 's so unfair when it 's about transylvania 's romanians being under hungarian control . 
  yay a hungary hating thread . 
  ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ feelings ^ ^ ^ too, 
  literally first time i 've heard about this nonsense , is this really a thing ? 
  boy will you be scoffed at for the truth . 
  it 's well known that hungary is evil and any injustice and punishment against it is fair . 
  no need to acknowledge them so please reconsider . 
  these details in this case hardly matter . 
  was n't it so that anyone who 's already been in the uk prior will be allowed to remain ? 
  how ? 
  still it does n't warrant wishing death to his children . 
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uapwwyc6cdi&amp;t=2s username checks out ? 
  you figured it out, 
  maybe that truck was running on internet, 
  it showcases an attitude . 
  overreacting much ? 
  maybe we could pull an abraham, 
   it 's from a ridiculously biased book that basically portraits poland/the commonwealth as the centre of righteousness , democracy and everything good in the world you mean it was n't ? 
  that population density map is kinda neat . 
  what eu alternatives could there be for malta ? 
  is it sensitive though ? 
  i have n't heard of anyone raging about this , it was a major loss with severe consequences but nothing really controversial about it . 
  herodotus counted 1 million . 
  that 's how it 's always been and probably how it will always be forever . 
  yes , this was it . 
  is the city hall in the gothic quarter ? 
  i remember a building akin to this when i was there . 
   they also succeeded in making them think they are a separate from romanians and that the moldovan language is somehow different from romanian i guess that 's their greatest `` achievement '' then . 
  divide and conquer , quite russian indeed . 
  so they basically use romanian with cyrillic alphabet ? 
  that 's so strange . 
  tak !, 
  ( i do n't know how will i be able to pronounce & understand things once i get to the point where i 'll have a good reason to attempt actually speaking though ! ), 
  yeah i agree that at this political environment changing borders between such closely knit countries is n't practical , could go as far as to say it 's impossible and nonsense . 
  i did n't mean to imply that , was only wondering about perception of the region 's history . 
  it can be . 
  i have n't really met anyone yet who 'd think otherwise on our end . 
  if i recall correctly you are hungarian yourself ? 
  so you probably know the attitude there more i 'm sure . 
  so i assume russia was the most influential of all because it was the most recent one controlling it then ? 
  i mean that 's a thing both sides will view differently forever so i do n't know if there 's any pont in opening this particular can of worms anyways . 
  i 'm asking moldova because i 'm not that knowledgeable about its past . 
  i do n't mind if you feel it 's better not to talk about it though . 
  i mean transylvania for the most part of hungary 's history was part of it , moldova ( bessarabia ) on the other hand was under russian control ( or influence ? ), 
  for quite a while was n't it ? 
  i 'm just asking because i 've heard that there are plenty of moldovans who would n't even reunite with romania due to nationalistic sentiments . 
  wonder if that 's so significant how would they react to transnistria getting detached ? 
  * here we go again * you say that as if it was n't a major punishment of hungary . 
  you think they 'd do that ? 
  how could they anyway with transnistria not even under their control ? 
  you may, 
  nato members dismembering another nato member ? 
  highly doubt that . 
  i understood uv . 
  it 's not actually fucked . 
  `` only '' for the biosphere . 
   there 's also the thing where they do n't fully unpack their products to shelve them . 
  they just put open boxes on the shelves i thought that was normal in most places ? 
  not surprisingly , hungarians do love them . 
  was there any german support for turkey in the latter ? 
  nothing really , * mac\u00e1k * is the plural of that . 
  i believe he means [ this war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish_war_of_independence ) . 
  [ there may be ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_prehistory#original_homeland_.28c._800_bc.c2.a0.e2.80.93_before_600_ad.29 ) although i 'm uncertain of this particular word . 
  wiki article on the [ treaty of sevres ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_s%c3%a8vres ) [ treaty of lausanne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_lausanne ) that was ratified afterwards, 
  iirc that 's redeye from a starcraft cast . 
  fyi guys i did not make this , stop giving me undeserved props :(, 
  sorry i stated in another comment that i did not make this , just found it on the interwebz . 
  and maca means ~ slutty mistress in hungarian . 
  i guess you can * eat * that ? 
  [ the welsh word means pussywall in hungarian ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vhsa8az.jpg ) ( did n't make either ), 
  geopolitics has quite a say in that too . 
  ( but for the record i 'm not saying that spanish people are lazy . ), 
  received a british stamp of queue approval, 
  lithuania 's population is tiny compared to poland 's or the uk 's . 
  how does being poor or rich have any relevance on calling out ( perceived or real ) laziness ? 
  if you imply that they are poor because they are lazy ( which i know from first hand experience that most baltics are hard working people , btw ) you 're dismissing the moral of a whole chapter of history at the very least . 
  lithuania -  lithuania checks out, 
  * gets off the high horse of ignorance *, 
  and to flank through . 
  if it was only for the first part of the sentence he could 've been worried about him getting cancer eg . 
  eating * fika * would n't be your favourite pasttime in hungary though . 
  on the other hand serbia please stop being good at water polo , it 's our sport !, 
  what a loser !, 
  that article 's basically a stub . 
  unless he 's calling completely nonsense things i doubt that 'll happen . 
  especially with a neutral subject like this . 
  you can change that if you have the knowledge about the subject . 
  wiki article : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medal_for_gallantry_ ( greece ) it appears that there is a higher award though , established in 1926 . 
  i like how i know where all these regions are from ckii . 
  they feel cozy .
