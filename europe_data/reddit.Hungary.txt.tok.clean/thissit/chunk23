  also somehow there 's always that `` aged '' silence in them . 
  cowards . 
  you know you won whenthe other deletes in shame . 
  some call mbti horoscope for `` smart people '' . 
  imo it 's interesting , so long as you take everything with a grain of salt . 
  but that map seems bs anyway . 
  hungary , extrovert ? 
  doubt that . 
  i mean we are the porn capital of europe , quite fitting, 
  feels like dark souls, 
  and an ** ap\u00e1t ** s\u00e1g is an abbey ... 
  this is a thread about gold per capita . 
  their country is below another country therefore they are losing the thread . 
  seems so !, 
  hollandia pls ) :, 
  so would this mean `` money that actually gets converted into/for everyday use '' ? 
  how do you separate people saving from it ? 
  what do you think could be done to change all this ? 
  seems so ingrained in people the eastern we go . 
  higher tax = more expensive produce = less incentive to buy the thing ? 
  reconquista of a different kind huh ? 
  there 's also a town in hungary called [ bugyi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bugyi ) , lit . 
  panties, 
  bet some romanians would swear that 's true . 
  kind of hard to do anything against church influence when [ 81 % of romania 's population ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania#religion ) 's orthodox with only 0.2 % atheists ... 
  hey it 's me , you from the past, 
  so many remnants of lost peoples ; and the few far strongholds of western heritage . 
  this region really fascinates me . 
  [ m'europa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_-kobibg0 ), 
  familiar [ . 
   well , we can put her into the `` lying weasel '' category i thought we already established that she was a politican . 
  ca n't you see it bleeding ? 
  * checks flair * oh . 
  [ but i learrn !, 
  i learn !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6eaopmanqm ), 
  for some reason this reminds me of one of the palace rooms you can get in a mount & blade mod . 
  the quality of those things is subpar anyway . 
  i 'm sorry but probably anything would look like fairy tales ' time compared to today 's moldova . 
  do n't mind if we do, 
  on another note it 's crazy to think that there is only 1.1 million estonians around . 
  you guys take care of yourselves, 
  ca n't argue with that logic, 
  boy is that applicable today . 
  now that 's comprehensive . 
  so we are closest to slovenes then austrians, 
  you 're welcome yugo . 
  no doubt about that, 
  so we are a true german colony after all, 
   royal `` navy '', 
  technically we have access to the black sea since the danube is internationally available, 
  maybe they are leasing like the netherlands , 
  when a squadron of fighter jets and a boat love each other very much ... 
  hence the flugzeugtr\u00e4ger label, 
   rape them would be more traditional for russians, 
  true it probably is n't a priority in their current geopolitical environment . 
  glorious !, 
  to be completely honest ... it does n't seem like much at all for a powerhouse like germany . 
  i mean they had 400 soldiers in wwii , can at least acquire a wooden boat or something . 
  it 's like partying in a park in front of a cemetery . 
   there are even a lot of rooms clearly made to party that sounds quite disrespectful, 
  that 's a neat guesstimate , cheers !, 
  implying britain would be the same with hitler or napoleon being able to just pop over prior . 
  i would be really curious how would europe 's climate be if its geography was something similar today . 
  * i meant with current global climate ( let 's just say the whole region was just high enough to be above water , with current sea levels ) , how would such geography affect europe 's climate . 
  actually it was part of hungary that time , not sure why the separation . 
  yeah i agree with you on that one . 
  i mean would it require more effort to import than to have a whole separate project to research , develop and produce your own ? 
  yeah unlike the seklers today * ahem * . 
  guess living in the same place for 1000 years is n't enough . 
  aw yeah , 15 years after we took vienna . 
  crazy to think that in 30 years the ottomans were already sieging it . 
  you mean what hitler refers to [ in the mannerheim recording ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clr9tcpkzec&amp;t=10m45s ) ? 
  spain wtf ? 
  i did n't think anyone could be more complacent/careless than us . 
  if i was to exaggerate and simplify i 'd say that the reason you have n't been a northern ukraine for russia yet is that they kept your best parts from wwii on ... 
  no , it 's efficient to not waste capital and resources on developing pretty much the same thing . 
   pls fix this does n't fit my agenda, 
  so is it wrong to call [ this ] ( http://sulitura.hu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/citadella-840x560.jpg ) in the middle of the city citadella as well ? 
  this is amazing . 
  i hope it 's there to stay . 
  not convinced about that less police = safer logic necessarily . 
  not unheard of in hungary . 
  that does not mean there 's a lack of effort though . 
  that 's a man with proper priorities . 
  merkel - leader of the free world ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_-kobibg0 ), 
   to try and flame the sub `` i long to be offended '', 
  nothing , read the article . 
   he also said george had approached him and tried to start a conversation the day he killed himself . 
  but he had been engrossed in a televised golf tournament and did not respond . 
  talk about feeling guilty . 
   george told told them his colleagues had locked him in a cage at the garage by force , doused him in a flammable liquid and set him on fire . 
  what was their response ? 
  `` do n't worry son i 'm sure it 'll work itself out '' they should 've made him quit the job right there and then . 
  such awful parents . 
  that soldier has a `` i 'm so much cooler than these guys '' on lol, 
  yeah something tells me they found london . 
  it 's been a while since i watched f1 !, 
  * for some reason they feel like our languages relate * honorary bros because of this * billions of lakes * metal * hockey & saunas * [ got ta love it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/c8oae0m.jpg ) * depression vs alcohol * rally & mika h\u00e4kkinen & kimi raikkonen * h\u00fcdraulik pressz csen\u00f6l * basically northern estonia, 
  but then again you can say that about 90 % of all food,
