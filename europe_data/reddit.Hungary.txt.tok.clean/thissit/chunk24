  last time i saw him he was somewhere in the demon ruins ... 
  neat to know !, 
  yeah that ardennes name rings a bell , would 've just put it in france probably if i was asked though . 
  wait ... belgium has hills and stuff ? 
  how is immigration relevant here ? 
  do they tend to erect out-of-place buildings much ? 
  for some reason i had this image of * some * slight damage to london but nothing to this scale . 
  may have been mixed up with wwi zeppelin raids and their ineffectiveness in my mind . 
  the nazis sure were n't sitting home twiddling their thumbs . 
  [ g\u00d6tterfunken ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_-kobibg0 ) oh sorry wrong thread, 
  problem is , the opposition had a good 8 years prior to fidesz 's second term to destroy any and all of their credibility and no decent alternative has emerged since then . 
  that 's an interesting point , was the damage that significant ? 
  i 'm wondering because one of the last major battles between germany and russia was the 50-day siege of budapest and the city got through it [ fairly unscathed ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=hu&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=670&amp;q=battle+of+budapest&amp;oq=battle+of+budapest&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i24k1l4.1304.5294.0.5505.31.23.4.0.0.0.225.3041.5j13j3.21.0....0...1.1.64.img..6.22.2868.0..35i39k1j0i30k1j0i19k1j0i30i19k1.z87ogvfj6i0#imgrc=nwcgjnjdtqejzm: ) . 
  of course one can make the point that the nature of an urban battle differs from terror bombing the civilian population i guess . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ j/k, 
  to be honest i 've grown up in budapest and the lack of lush hills downtown was a bit of a turnoff ...  for real though , it just felt like the city did n't really know what it wanted to be about . 
  was a mix of random styled , unappealing buildings with the occasional world famous landmark ( and semi-disassembled , unused bridge ) but there was n't anything that bonded them together , apart from the usual british traffic safety features . 
  it did n't really stand out from being just another british city , just somewhat larger ( i traveled across a few times too , my pal 's aunt lived in the outskirts and we stayed there ) . 
  i get what you 're saying , that there 's more beneath the surface , but i meant it about the city 's aesthetic appeal , which the op is about . 
  it never really grabbed me for some reason ( and it was n't even raining ! ), 
  but muh flair !, 
  coming from a french guy that 's quite the compliment, 
  no problem for a trebuchet . 
  so is that sentence the same in norwegian as in danish ? 
   actually , in most muslims countries birth rates are not too much higher than in europe . 
  18 for indonesia , 18 for turkey , 20 for bangladesh , 27 for pakistan , compared to  10 for most eu countries . 
  not sure how you interpret data but the map shows ~ 8-10 for the entire eu . 
  turkey 's 18 ( the lowest figure in your example ) , which is ** twice ** as much as that , is certainly * much * higher than the average . 
  not to mention pakistan 's 27 which is still over twice that of the most fertile european country , france with 13 . 
  not to mention the aging population of most european countries compared to the younger middle eastern ones . 
  i mean they do run the us now apparently . 
  we did put a decent early crack in it tho . 
  [ `` we did not start it !, 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfl6lu3xqw0 ), 
  exaggerating much ? 
  i do n't get the appeal of london . 
  been there twice and it never touched me as anything particularly special to be honest . 
  ____ * apologies for speaking my mind i guess ? 
   maybe it 's just a cultural thing i may have giggled . 
  united in diversity , after all . 
   among the most infamous blunders , he said the thousands of people made homeless by the 2009 l'aquila earthquake should act like they are on a camping trip dude, 
  i 'm curious how will it go down with putin . 
  ah gotcha , that makes sense . 
  ah did n't know that , not following the event closely . 
  that 1.2 million hungarians sure weighed that much against the 18million romanians and gypsies ... maybe people just generally liked the hungarian one more . 
  i would say it was that since the country turned catholic in 1000 . 
  it 's been the go-to language for the high/upper class since . 
  also of course the church , law-making and of scientific works and studies . 
  generally , emergence of the whole movement for switching to the common language got delayed compared to w-europe due to the ottomans holding a significant portion of our lands and population until the xvii . 
  century . 
  alright i was concerned whether you 're serious or not . 
  thanks for clearing that up . 
  i ca n't believe he 's done this, 
  goes way beyond than that . 
  fun fact it was the official language ( if that can be said for the time ) in hungary until the 1830s . 
  europe loves us !, 
  what a beauty !,

  well she did not specify any date , i read the article as these are just the future prospects ( which obviously needs meeting a good number of criteria beforehand ) . 
  it kind of makes sense to prevent/counter russian influence in the powder keg . 
  itt : people unaware of the official names of their mother tongues . 
  agree on that one though . 
  maybe they 'd like to use up all the coal before they 'll use up all the sunlight / s, 
  sounds legit, 
  maybe that 's her vengeance ... / r/conspiracy, 
  because of her stance on how to follow it through . 
  you talk like it would barely affect you after it 's sorted out . 
  needs more hdr, 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd4jndkgj_y ), 
  ahh , til . 
  alright then !, 
  delet this, 
   cause it 's sounding a teeny bit like a pyramid or ponzi scheme . 
  because it is . 
  gdp ( ppp ) is also gdp . 
  guess you mean nominal ? 
  communism , not even once . 
  anyone remembers chocolatier ? 
  looks like something out of that game . 
  thank you man , keep up the great work , all of you !, 
  * ahem * yeah , german is quite straightforward . 
  to be honest i 'm not aware of any negative sentiments from the general population towards serbia/serbs here . 
  could go as far as considering you guys loud and quick tempered ( ? ), 
  but that 's pretty much it . 
  [ hungary was n't exactly a fully compiling , faithful ally to nazi germany . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungary%e2%80%93poland_relations#world_war_ii )  hitler would soon have cause to rue his decision regarding the fate of carpatho-ukraine . 
  in six months , during his 1939 invasion of poland , the common polish-hungarian border would become of major importance ** when admiral horthy 's government , on the ground of long-standing polish-hungarian friendship , declined , as a matter of `` hungarian honor , '' [ 8 ] hitler 's request to transit german forces across carpathian rus into southeastern poland to speed that country 's conquest ** [ . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungary%e2%80%93poland_relations#world_war_ii )  the hungarian refusal allowed the polish government and tens of thousands of military personnel to escape into neighboring hungary and romania also one of the reasons nazi germany invaded hungary towards the end of wwii was their reluctance to commit `` properly '' ( that 's ugly to write but you get the point ) to holocaust in hungary under horthy ( who they replaced with right wingers of the arrow cross party after they invaded ) . 
  i doubt such ( potential ) shifts derive primarily from what the populace thinks . 
  hurray for soviet influence dragging us down !, 
  they have awesosme towns & landscapes all around the country . 
  also they elected a pretty cool guy recently . 
  closely resembling a basement probably . 
  [ g\u00d6tterfunkel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_-kobibg0 ), 
   historically , that 's when the shit hits the fan , especially in europe . 
  yeah , because all those poles were * in * europe . 
  more like wwi and ii . 
  chess into birds , got it, 
  k.u.k right after germany , more than uk ... now all we have is a bunch of tiny , useless states that amount to no significance alone whatsoever . 
  2nd and 3rd are hungarian,
