  why bother , just dismiss it either way without care if it does n't fit your narrative . 
  i think twice before talking on public transportation though i most likely should n't . 
  people who i mention to that i 'm hungarian when asked about whether i 'm polish seem to not get visibly upset , rather surprised . 
  this of course could have [ several ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2t6ule0.png ) reasons behind it . 
  2016 is quite a pr year for britain ; only in the wrong direction . 
  i 'm sure it 's better to go with speculation and guesswork then . 
  they were conditioned against that after wwii . 
   do you cheer for other inanimate objects ? 
  [ i 'm in love with my car ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgee3fnizy4 ), 
  well at least in hungary if you earn abroad you get taxed there , you only get taxed for what you earned in hungary . 
   make sure you have health insurance do you mean ni or nhs ? 
   the dates of every trip outside the uk what if you go back to your country for a 2-week holiday with your id ? 
  would you just show plane tickets ? 
  thing is , you either have this or being called out for state supporting newspapers . 
  there 's no win situation . 
  it 's not exactly a sudden end if the paper had troubles for the past 10 years . 
  maybe sudden considering ( and assuming ) how reluctant they were to assess the situation . 
  people seem to take baits quite easily nowadays . 
  there 's serious overreaction both ways in this thread . 
  still does n't feel like something one would make a newspaper shut down for . 
  unless it 's an apropos ofc . 
  i was surprised bulgaria was lower than us . 
  although probably not in the eastern lowlands . 
  did they dramatically descend on ropes amid special effects to said wedding ? 
  otherwise i do n't really see what 's the fuss about the whole ordeal . 
  unless it was a military/state chopper paid by the taxpayers . 
  [ umm , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hadrian%27s_wall ) [ what ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_wall ), 
  flawless, 
  what 's life without some fun, 
  eating the pig ? 
  man , one could spend a month and really just scratch the surface for most countries around here . 
  that cool runnings scene comes to mind when the jamaicans arrive at calgary . 
   those of them who have a legitimate claim to refugee status ( a minority , possibly , but certainly some of them ) are retroactively absolved from the law-breaking involved in their flight . 
  yeah that does not sound like a healthy way of going about it . 
  why would we make exception with these people ? 
  laws should apply to everyone the same way . 
  especially those being so eager about breaking them . 
  this article would be relevant if the v4 were as closely knit as it implies them to be . 
  and stronk, 
  belated solidarity with the southern hemisphere ? 
   you wo n't see / r/europe complaining about that though . 
  brits do it for the rest of us regarding that . 
  i 'd wager there 's quite a difference between not accepting illegal aliens and members of the same union who are by law allowed to enter your country after ( due to your special treatment ) having produced appropriate documentation . 
  they can , legally , by all means . 
  not invading from the waters . 
  rip . 
  you 've changed a lot for the better , neighbours . 
  keep it up !, 
  those xenophobe bastards ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  success in what exactly ? 
  falling apart ? 
  [ lol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_empire ), 
  how are you relocating your money though ? 
  or just wait for the pound to sink to record lows ? 
  brilliant, 
  ca n't wait for them to be completely out ( :, 
   ironically , i bet you applaud the destruction of statues of lenin and stalin there is no irony in that whatsoever . 
   i doubt ... romanians really have anything against you . 
  [ oh boy would you be wrong ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/3gn3nh/hungary_the_odd_one_out/ctznc9b?st=itwl51ht&amp;sh=1c2ab6f3 ), 
   with the eastern xenophobe remember , it 's only horrible if small nations are so . 
  i 'm honored being called that by people such awful at assessing things . 
  well you know which one he bases it on . 
  that 's what one get for acting like a spoiled child i suppose . 
  does n't change the fact that you 're sugarcoating a shithole ( :, 
  shh you 're interrupting the rumanian propaganda circlejerk . 
  lol i 've got a guess where those downvotes are coming from . 
  that 's not very constructive , the damage has already been done . 
  better care about solutions now . 
  all them master trolls around here . 
  [ case in point ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_of_hungary_and_poland ), 
  you have to choose between austrian empire , kingdom of hungary or czechoslovakia . 
  any high res of this ? 
  looks amazing . 
  that 's nice indeed . 
  there really need to be more of this all around the eu to make the project feel alive . 
  makes the general populace much more aware than some billboards or official media . 
  kakheti & kartli were my core regions when i played through with georgia in ckii ^ ^, 
  `` guys we are still relevant m ` kay ?? '', 
  he 's like that old greek dude from my big fat greek wedding . 
   but britain much more [ influence ] for sure . 
  ... britain went all around the globe . 
  so how do you conclude that from a map of europe exactly ? 
  is n't the althing ( icelandic parliament ) one of the oldest around ? 
  because extremism feeds from fear and hatred . 
  you turn westerners against peaceful muslims , you end up with a lot of hate and rejection . 
  it 's way easier to radicalize those rejected , alienated muslims against the evil west then . 
  recent times were really quiet . 
  just goes to show the ( relative ) overreaction from the media . 
  exactly what the terrorists want . 
  absolutely not in szeklerland . 
  never heard anyone calling it vin either . 
  does n't mean they are not present . 
  unique snowflakes *, 
  unique snowflakes *, 
  do n't talk just drink, 
   ... in some regions of the iberian peninsula there 's ( even nowadays ) a linguistic phenomenon called betacism where people read `` v '' instead of `` b '' , so `` bibere '' ( drinking in latin ) becomes `` vivere '' ( living in latin ) if you watch aoe , one of the casters , memb is spanish , [ he does this all the time ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqv58ydkvgq&amp;t=20s ) ( thebiper ) . 
  also the random `` e `` s in front of words starting with `` s '' ( estone ) . 
  he calls it spanglish . 
  well the next war was seeded in the flawed closure of the great war so it 's a bit naive to solely blame hitler/germany for it .
