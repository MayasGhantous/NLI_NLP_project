  i do n't recall churchill calling for planned , accelerated & industrialized destruction of a people though , even less actually following through with such a plan . 
  lol , did n't even notice . 
  maybe the map 's flawed ? 
  i 'll delete if so . 
  * deleted, 
  language maps would be much less accurate if it was down to showing things on a country basis . 
  [ look at this map ] ( http://www.eurfedling.org/maps/languages_europe.jpg ) and compare it with country boundaries . 
   i would link this word to croatian/old church slavic word ' \u017ertva ' , meaning sacrifice that 's actually pretty cool . 
  ^ ^ maybe ^ ^ they ^ ^ think ^ ^ about ^ ^ them ^ ^ drinking ^ ^ wine ... 
   i 'm not entirely sure which are the people you are reffering to [ i 'm sure you do n't ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sz%c3%a9kelys#origins ) ( :, 
  of course . 
  but i 'm sure / u/caydenz would prefer them all eradicated . 
  what a fascinating language, 
  i think it 's those people that lived there for over a millennium and you do n't even want to give them autonomy . 
  ^ ^ let ^ ^ the ^ ^ fun ^ ^ begin, 
  i searched for ` whore ' in european languages , got this as a result \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
   boom , a company backed by sir richard branson , is developing a concorde-like supersonic jet . 
  it hopes to achieve london to new york in three-and-a-half hours , a journey which currently takes more than eight hours . 
  it is expected to run test flights later this year . 
  any more info on this ? 
  curious that they do n't even mention the name of the plane . 
   uk airlines will still fly uk to eu , just not eu-eu [ there 's a great video about this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thqbja2dc-e ) over at wendover productions . 
  channel worths checking out too . 
   the level of punditry on this subreddit is spectacular why thank you . 
  his inner omsk bird is getting amped up ... 
  brilliant !, 
  do n't worry croatia , we 're always aware < 3 ^ ^ ^ pu ? 
  fyi all empires are multicultural , it 's in the very definition of an * empire * . 
  i was curious when will the usual banter come with this current sub trend, 
  [ it was ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%93buda )  \u00d3buda was a city in hungary that was merged with buda and pest on 1 january 1873, 
  if that 's what you call 12yos over there, 
  i think you 're trying a bit hard, 
  screw the haters . . ** gott erhalte !, 
  woah , i thought they actually beat them 3-0, 
  guise he wuz kiddin, 
   its economy doubled in just the 4 years between 2004 and 2008 wait , really ? 
  `` island - island '', 
   i love how people still wet behind the ears from having just fallen out of a vaginal canal 5 minutes ago , immediately have a sense of displaced possession   first of all `` you '' did n't lose shit , you 're just some asshole who was born yesterday and has n't earned or fought for anything . 
   whoever your imagined ancestors were ... you 're not them , and the land they were allowed to stop on to catch their breath as they were being chased out of central russia by etelcoz , is n't yours because it was never theirs , so calm your mongoloid tits and remind yourself that budapest had a population of over 80 % german speaking people in the 1800s . 
  [ when they let them loose ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5zivj7/last_year_hungary_forbade_their_diplomats_from/deyk2rt/?st=j0b998ms&amp;sh=5c92ac2d ), 
   transilvania was it 's own country and was never really part of hungary wtf ? 
  dude you really need to learn some real history pronto, 
  now read that again ... then the rest of your comments . 
  fyi i was making a joke . 
  ofc it 's better to be on good terms all around with this eu project still around . 
  if you see a `` death to romania '' tone in this then you may be * just * a little paraniod . 
  except the current hungarian republic is the * direct * damn successor of the state that held those territories prior . 
  ca n't say the same for egypt , can you . 
  and claim we never had something we had for 1000 years . 
  because italy is n't a de jure successor of the roman empire perhaps ? 
  romanians/moldovans upvote it alright apparently . 
  i do n't even have to comment on this . 
  boy are your jimmies rustled because someone bothers pointing out the truth . 
  yes , hungary was absolutely * shafted * with trianon . 
  yes , we lost most of our country that we had for a thousand years . 
  frothe all you 'd like it wo n't change facts . 
  yeah cause the world worked like that in ~ 900 . 
  just accept * facts * . 
  it 's nonsense to claim it was n't ours to begin with . 
  of course not , otherwise they would 've given szeklerland autonomy already . 
   but it was n't yours to begin with what ? 
  it was for a good 1000 + years . 
  what reality do you live in ? 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ think ^ ^ he ^ ^ snapped, 
  it concerns diplomats ? 
  i mean it * is * a diplomatic move . 
  i find this odd , are we expected to cherish losing most of our country ? 
  * insults wo n't change facts . 
  hungary got massively shafted and you know it . 
  `` when you find yourself in a hole , stop digging . '', 
  we just like to toast that much . 
  cheers neighbour !, 
  damn right . 
  they 're just doing a job tho . 
  that they are nearly on par in gdp ( ppp ) with us . 
  also we almost sent them home in the last euro but they got through and eventually won . 
  asking the important questions, 
  oh damn , i read this as `` tortured '' and was so confused as to why everyone 's so nonchalant about it . 
  lol . 
  then she 'll remember she actually meant may when she said march . 
  by commie ozymandias, 
  no chance , wales would never leave you . 
  who owns it and what 's that thing on there ( assuming house ) ? 
  `` only * we * are allowed to make fools of ourselves ! '', 
  lol did n't mean it to sound like that , whoops . 
  drinking dutch blood ... metal . 
  about 6 million . 
  dude they are only a few spots above hungary ... whatever happened to them ? 
  do you just eat these as is ? 
  i 'd require a couple loaves of bread for all that stuff probably . 
  i can relate to your flag, 
  `` nice , now we can shaft them without worrying about real consequences '', 
  nice , i do have euiv , have n't played a lot though lately . 
  fighting off abbasids + byzantines + nomads simultaneously was quite fun already !, 
  i can only wish the best for you guys . 
  keep your heads high !, 
   the worst part of it all is that he 'll get support domestically for this kind of irresponsible behavior that 's the very reason he 's doing it like this i believe . 
  yeah i see what you mean , i 'm just arguing that in theory it 's not a problem that some group of countries takes the initiative . 
  of course if they were to form exclusive rights to address vital questions that could and would raise eyebrows and potentially undermine the whole project . 
  i do n't think we have to worry about such though .
