  interesting map , bad title, 
  could be a good basis for future regional integration if they could agree on basics . 
  that 's a big if though ( and something the eu itself struggles with as well ) . 
   does n't give you exclusive rights i take this as the option is there for everyone , they are just the ones taking the questions and bringing them up more seriously . 
  that 's right , though he 's just pointing it out that * if * all the ice melted the end result would n't be what i linked . 
  it 's a good point . 
  yeah , wonder how significant that would be . 
  [ found this image ] ( https://static01.nyt.com/images/2005/10/24/science/20051025_arctic.2.jpg ) showing that in 3000 years how the bedrock may rebound somewhat . 
  yeah in like [ 3000 years ] ( https://static01.nyt.com/images/2005/10/24/science/20051025_arctic.2.jpg ) . 
  sounds good . 
  nato would really make you that much safer . 
  wonder what would become of the situation with the russian occupied territories though . 
  what a terrible way to indicate the countries ' standings . 
  xc all day !, 
  how long did it take ? 
  what were the costs ? 
  what was your ride ? 
  ~ ~ second ~ ~ third coming of napoleon soon ? 
  that benelux part really is the soft underbelly of the eu . 
  what international organisations are you in ? 
  anything nato-esque ? 
  must be really difficult to stand up to a massive and asserting neighbour as russia . 
  wow cold war just got next level ? 
  glad you enjoyed your time here man !, 
  always welcome back ... , 
  that 's neat we use `` gr\u00fazia '' also in hungarian . 
  but no , usually not , in fact i barely know anything about the us state . 
  yeah the one that 's been around for a millennium or so, 
  good on you guys . 
  i played with you in ckii , was a challenging run , 
  i am all german on this blessed day , 
   tfw you 're literally hitler :(, 
  do n't worry , new poland \u2122 will rejoin the eu alright , if the motherlannd stays ^ ^ / s ^ ^ just ^ ^ in ^ ^ case, 
  just tell them they are threatened . 
  i think there 's a fascist ( hitler ? 
  quote about this . 
  the uk shall return !, 
  weaker and less privileged !, 
  r\u00e1galom !, 
  `` you would think not germany ... '' we 've been a german colony for a good while lol . 
  me too thanks, 
  horses are dope, 
   literally the opposite happened ... at first they were allowed on to reach germany ( same as what austria did ) then we locked the main railway station down so that they ca n't board because they stormed all westward trains . 
   they proceeded , because hungary let them in , but then only let them sleep on the street and was n't able to take care of even a fraction of them yeah what exactly are you obliged to do with people forcing themselves into your country and not wanting to be registered as refugees ? 
  how are you going to deal with hundreds of thousands that appear on your doorstep on a whim in a country already struggling to provide for their very own citizens ? 
  [ they were given water ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hcjnvp88ha ) while they blocked our highway system because they so decided that they want to run to germany . 
  that 's all . 
  we do n't owe these people anything if they do n't want to play by the rules . 
  simple as that . 
  you mean they proceeded on by their free will ? 
  ( we even tried to register them to spite merkel lol ) tf with trying to smear us like this ? 
  boy i love nature, 
  [ asylum applications in eu and efta states between 1 january and 30 june 2015 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/map_of_the_european_migrant_crisis_2015.png ) during the crisis we had the most applications per capita . 
  from those how many actually received it , i 'm unsure . 
  ( * [ see also ] ( http://www.dw.com/image/18723820_401.jpg ) ), 
   and yet i 'd trade it all yeah from the comfort of your home you would . 
  once you 'd spend a bit of time outside civilization you 'd realize you 've made a huge mistake . 
  well they have n't seen you , everything 's just assumption and as such it 's nothing to be happy or sad about . 
  no worries . 
   what helped me was doing emotionaly intensive things , like sport and meeting new people this works so well , been doing it for the past few weeks to deal with a similar situation . 
  really keeps your thoughts fresh/occupied . 
  net migration 1.5 for hungary ? 
  people just want to live in this paradise do n't they, 
  how about this , convince saudi arabia to take some of their brethren ? 
  unfortunately crusader kings ii teached me to weigh * de facto * territories more . 
  here it 's * v\u00edzil\u00f3 * ( v\u00edz + i = from the water , l\u00f3 = horse ), 
  is good !, 
  wtb same wages . 
  but can you really rush huge projects like the eu if you want to do it right ? 
  i 'd say orban tries to balance between eu and russia , keeping at mostly positive terms with both if possible . 
  what if i was to pour salt by the side and dip like it was ketchup ? 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ used ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ do ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ lot , ^ ^ ^ now ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ dead, 
  i eat the fries and leave both untouched . 
  and then pass on as facts . 
  sad !, 
  yeah maybe just a better angle on that one . 
  that 's just gorgeous dude . 
  was about to say , in the op that 's barely anyone there . 
  this is more like it . 
  but the tenth of the entire estonian population is only about 15 ppl . 
  ca n't argue with this logic, 
  yup , garmin . 
  that 's the worst colour coding i 've seen in a while . 
  as if it was trying to push an agenda . 
  2:52:25 so far this week for me , mostly cycling . 
  will run later today . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksqm9hktva4 ), 
  something brown and long, 
  you bet, 
  i am all czech on this blessed day, 
  kamel\u00e5s\u00e5, 
  we are all czechs on this blessed day, 
  been to mostar few years after the war , very much worth a visit . 
   well , it failed to address basic problems . 
  reminiscent of another union ... 
  it was more due to the dark horse the russians though . 
  we still would 've won ( possibly ) vs austria + croatia . 
  i thought that was normal ? 
  rolls right off the tongue, 
  maybe he 's projecting a bit too,
