  there are always some who get caught in the dividing political rhetoric , on both sides . 
  i can bring up general examples as well but it is ( should ) always be down to the individual . 
  hungarians and slovaks lived together mostly peacefully for a millennium and will continue doing so . 
  it was just banter , no worries . 
  i have no problems with slovakia or slovaks . 
  `` atelcusu '' which i believe comes from western chronicles of the time ( so does the mistaken `` turkish tribe '' ) . 
  it 's called etelk\u00f6z in hungarian . 
  ( [ gif of the hungarian migration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_conquest_of_the_carpathian_basin#/media/file:honfoglalas.gif ) ), 
  swap the hungarian & uk arrows if you do n't want imminent and immediate defeat !, 
  [ must always link this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk&amp;index=58&amp;list=plw4novq87blvitte4hp9_2r6yjslcfd7m ), 
  or szimpla, 
  let the gerrymandering begin, 
  90 distance to all `` related '' european languages ? 
  i 'll take it . 
  even path of exile does n't display it properly ... how will i marathon through 10 acts without \u0151 and \u0171 there to support me ??

  ** [ i personally believe , that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj3inxz8dww ) **, 
  yeah when you define ` invaded ' as loose as possible . 
   hungary : also , a large bread-based snack which looks like a giant pretzel is quite common -- usually with salty , melted cheese dripped over the top . 
  you mean [ l\u00e1ngos ?

  i would 've said claymore if scotland was n't against brex, 
  i sure hope you 'll upgrade to tier 10 soon . 
  that 's not a nice thing to say in a thread like this tbh . 
   hungary  independence 4 june 1920 from what , 2/3 of our land ? 
  damn you 'll get so downvoted for the truth . 
  renault ft ? 
  when 's our first ssto due ? 
  * checks flair * how you doin ' ? 
  heck yeah we can . 
  what 's this from ? 
  and flags !,

  have you ever been to japan or another se asian country ? 
  i wonder how would that feel compared to the netherlands . 
  we still prefer cans and glasses here . 
  we still prefer cans and glasses here . 
  has pc gone too far ? 
  yeah but they could n't contain us so offered co-op on their empire . 
  * flashsbacks to stalin 's gulag quota system *, 
  i would n't mind it that much , you have some other t1 and even more t2 soil elsewhere . 
  better have a metropolis than a bit of arable land if you have more to spare . 
  spain 's interior is quite arid ( desert even ? ), 
  yeah i already said that, 
  well i figured that much , that 's partly why :p, 
  talk about fighting windmills though . 
  spain = catalunya , you heard it here first boys, 
  looks ripe indeed . 
  lol , i rather not comment on this one then . 
   misleading since the valleys are packed oh yeah that 's a good point actually . 
  well why do you think they are so lenient about the whole lgbt topic ? 
  cool he backed down . 
  must keep * some * of that karma . 
  remember that genetics map ? 
  central & eastern europe are quite close to each other iirc . 
  not that much in \u00d6sterreich tho . 
  the german named one ? 
  what 's the matter with him ? 
  iirc he was a cool guy . 
  we are all slavs on this blessed day, 
  new tibet , scotland, 
  iirc that `` bread basket of europe '' phrase originated in/around the xix . 
  century though . 
  great map btw !, 
  no it 's not . 
  either way you just seem to have this utter desire to be triggered . 
  and what you 're triggered about ** is ** besides the point . 
  [ there 's no need ... ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/jwnpackjdipsi/giphy.gif ), 
  that 's a very good point . 
  although i ca n't remember anything about ukraine 's agriculture / - al capacity being mediocre/subpar either . 
  i was expanding on my point about relevance of state borders regarding the context of the map . 
  maybe the three romanian pensioners in / r/europe found your comment and objected, 
  boy could this title lead to some banter, 
  but , but ... historic clay !, 
   deus eult i kinda dig that, 
  i 'm not entirely sure about him not being entirely sure about that then . 
  who would want to live in the swamp anyways ? 
  [ yup i was told just recently !,

  oh boy the colonies seem rebellious, 
  you mean a resistance against being more efficient ? 
  was there a significant change in utilisation since the reunification ? 
  was asking / u/redioun about their endeavours . 
  idk i just had [ this monty python scene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bde9msexuk8&amp;t=1m11s ) pop in mind . 
  if i was german i 'd care more about preu\u00dfen . 
  lol they had the audacity, 
  i 'd assume the soil has n't changed significantly in the past 20-40 years . 
  it sort of makes sense though ( although there were plenty of other factors too ) . 
  better for agriculture = less incentive to industrialize . 
  note primarily ukraine ( `` bread basket of europe '' ) but also romania and hungary on the flats .

  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2thv3i/soil_quality_of_european_countries/?st=iz2ojgmq&amp;sh=a397113a )  ** soil resilience **  the ability of the land to revert to a near original production level after it is degraded , as by mismanagement . 
  land with low soil resilience is permanently damaged by degradation . 
   ** soil performance **  the ability of the land to produce ( as measured by yield of grain , or biomass ) under moderate levels of inputs in the form of conservation technology , fertilizers , pest and disease control . 
  land with low soil performance is generally not suitable for agriculture . 
   ** land quality class 1 **  this is prime land . 
  soils are highly productive , with few management-related constraints . 
  soil temperature and moisture conditions are ideal for annual crops .
