  risk for sustainable crop production is generally less than 20 % . 
   ** land quality classes 2 and 3 **  these soils have few problems for sustainable production . 
  their productivity is generally very high ; however , care must be taken to reduce potential degradation . 
  risk for sustainable crop production is generally 20-40 % , but risks can be reduced with good conservation practices . 
   ** land quality classes 4 , 5 and 6 **  these soils are not suited for grain crop production without important inputs of conservation management . 
  in fact , no grain production must be contemplated in the absence of a good conservation plan . 
  lack of plant nutrients is a major constraint . 
  soil degradation must be continuously monitored . 
  productivity is not high . 
  risk for sustainable grain crop production is 40-60 % . 
   ** land quality class 7 **  these soils are definitely not suitable for low-input crop production . 
  their low resilience makes them easily prone to degradation . 
  they should be retained as natural forests or range . 
  risk for sustainable grain crop production is 60-80 % . 
   ** land quality classes 8 and 9 **  these soils belong to very fragile ecosystems or are very uneconomical to use for crop production . 
  they should be retained in their natural state . 
  risk for sustainable crop production is greater than 80 % . 
  how does it feel ? 
  well to be fair you commented before them . 
  itt : justice for croatia, 
  i mean , on the map it 's wrongly coloured , in the table ( see op 's comment ) it 's 56 % . 
  dude they drink it out of fucking * cartons * . 
  how barbaric is that ? 
   kamel\u00e5s\u00e5 [ i love this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ), 
   ( lower score is better ) would argue with that hungary is n't coloured right on the map according to the table op posted . 
  it should be the same colour as slovakia - and yes it does get a ton of energy from paks . 
  idk man , those tsunamis could very well reach through the alps . 
  so is it that both vocabularies share the same meaning for * vod\u0103 * but switch between * cerna * & * negru * depending on who uses the whole structure ? 
  it will be after the next accident, 
  fresh & cool alright, 
  and what about the populace ? 
  cernavod\u0103 = blackwater ? 
  we ai n't scared [ ^ ^ our ^ ^ words ^ ^ are ^ ^ backed ^ ^ with ^ ^ nuclear ^ ^ reactors ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7jlduhh.jpg ), 
  how come there 's ( almost ) none in the netherlands ? 
  that is awesome !, 
  but what happened to the hill and fort on the left side of the 1636 pic ? 
  the heck did you rotate us 30 \u00b0 for ? 
  [ i think there were talks about it yes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visegr%c3%a1d_group#austria ) , but nothing too serious . 
  `` the ultimate * cordon sanitaire * '', 
   the government and parliament have executed a number of i thought this was going somewhere different lol, 
  i 'm surprised by the us . 
  seeing everyday commodities cost so much there compared to europe i assumed they just had a more saturated ( ? ), 
  economy with higher prices and higher wages . 
  minimal wage there must feel like living in a post-communist country then . 
  i do n't think such has anything to do with being nice or not nice though . 
  it 's just about opportunities . 
  you can bet russia never would 've invaded ukraine had they kept the nuclear arsenal they inherited from the ussr . 
  that 's what they want you to believe, 
  i meant it in a sense that you would n't want to recognize it either ( was just a light jab nothing else ) . 
  iirc there was a time ( early '30s mb ? ), 
  when hitler feared poland might invade before they can build up their military . 
  gotcha , thanks !, 
   but this dude was balancing beetween east and west sounds like poland in the '30s, 
  scotland could be your kosovo . 
  i am now and all for ~ ~ it ~ ~ them !, 
  where 's the trump accent ? 
  [ v5 anyone ? 
  [ there are alternatives ] ( http://imgur.com/a/si0bk ) you know  this 'd kinda look like a moustached man :d, 
  it 's always nice to finish on a daskj\u00e4vel note, 
  to be honest the colouring of `` tend to disagree '' is inconsistent with the rest . 
  that just sounds like a sensible way to go about it . 
  yo i found the hater, 
  of all the things, 
   in her letter , rudd says the status of eu citizens can only change after parliament has approved a new immigration system . 
  `` the great repeal bill will not change our immigration system , '' she wrote . 
  `` this will be done through a separate immigration bill and subsequent secondary legislation so nothing will change for any eu citizen , whether already resident in the uk or moving from the eu , without parliament 's approval . ''  rudd says she supports `` securing the rights of eu citizens already here , as well as establishing a new immigration system for new arrivals from the eu once we have left '' . 
  so the govt . 
  agrees that they need the current workforce already there ? 
  oh boy :d thanks for the laugh , i almost forgot . 
  woah i thought that was just due to my flair . 
  that 's neat !, 
  general stats would be : area : 533,615 km ^ 2 ( 5th in europe , behind ukraine but ahead of spain ) population : 64,301,710 ( 5th in europe , between france and uk ) gdp ( ppp ) : $ 1.767 trillion ( 6th in europe , behind italy but ahead of spain ) gdp ( per capita ) : $ 27,474 ( 24th in europe , between lithuania and greece ), 
  [ but it 's a thing !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/craiova_group ), 
  i like your passion . 
  but as of now , nato is unimaginable without the us that contributes what , 70 % of the entire budget ? 
  the eu would need to step their game up significantly for it to remain a meaningful alliance would the us back off . 
  they 'd probably need to up their contribution anyway ( if we count russia as power being able to at least regionally project power ) which is actually a fair point of trump . 
  but the question of how real a threat russia actually is could itself be an entire separate thread i 'd say . 
  wall them in lest they escape !, 
  i answered that one assuming `` a part '' , would be an awkward way of asking with the opposite meaning . 
  i wonder how long will that guy manage to stay president . 
  his first few weeks were a disaster . 
  i think he 'll realize soon enough that he ca n't just do whatever the heck he wants with the international community without destroying the us ' image internationally . 
  that is , if he has the capacity to understand such aspects of being a head of state . 
  nothing to worry so long as you 're part of eu and nato is capable . 
  not if they are trying to establish a [ moscow-berlin axis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics#content ) with their own spheres of influence . 
  that book i linked is written by a guy sometimes dubbed `` putin 's brain '' ... 
  while it may be outdated in some aspects and certainly would n't be implemented as is , it can give you an idea about what * could * they potentially be planning to achieve . 
  in all honesty i do n't think you have any other decent alternatives . 
  craiova group is in its infancy , also not as significant as v4 in numbers and even v4 is n't like a supranational alliance , more like a loose group atm . 
  although i bet russia would n't mind a romania detached from the eu ... , 
  i think he 's more pro-eu than anything else ( mind you i only gathered this from some comments here and there ) . 
  if so , i do n't care if he 's pro- or anti-russia so long as it 's for the benefit of the eu as a whole . 
  what 's the story behind this ? 
  seems quite impractical , for such a short distance too . 
  lol sorry , should 've read more thoroughly . 
  ignore the previous comment . 
   moldova is also a very poor country and there are many romanians that do n't want reunification because they are afraid that it will have a hard impact on the economy that 's a bit like north and south korea , is n't it ? 
   wants to erase romanian history from children 's books .
