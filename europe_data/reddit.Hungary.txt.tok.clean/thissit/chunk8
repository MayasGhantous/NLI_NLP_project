  how he plans that ? 
  i do n't know . 
  what would he replace it with ? 
  some sort of russian/slavic type identity ? 
   said that if we want a unification it should be to make greater moldova . 
  lol lmao , ca n't say the guy is n't ambitious . 
   said romania gives too many scholarships to moldovan students as a form of propaganda . 
  so everything that 's wrong in moldova is romania 's fault ? 
  convenient rhetoric if people are susceptible to accepting it . 
  but you were part of the axis for 4-5 years during the war , only at the very end did you manage to swap sides when things went downhill . 
  most of those people died fighting for nazi germany ( eg . 
  invasion of russia ) , fighting against the allies . 
  is this moldovan-romanian identity split the main thing that stands in the way of reunification ? 
  or the issue with transnistria is even more serious ? 
  * lights a candle for tyrol *, 
  thanks that 's quite comprehensive !, 
  from what i read now if i was moldovan or romanian i would very much worry about that dodon guy ... how did he get elected ? 
   in 1812 , the eastern part of the principality of moldavia , called bessarabia , which includes the current territory of republic of moldova ( except for transnistria ) was ceded by the ottomans to the russian empire . 
  so am i right to essentially think of bessarabia as a `` russian ( influenced ) romania '' , transnistria aside ? 
  apart from those few who elected to believe the `` artifical moldovan fairy tale '' ? 
  what are the main differences between moldovans and romanians ? 
   romanian moldovan is that a thing ? 
  \\  implying they have a working education system, 
  it 's almost like romanian , but better !, 
  not sure , just googled the bridge and rehosted on imgur . 
  good questions , yeah would be interested in a summary as a separate post if you gather enough data . 
  cheers !, 
  well if you look at it this way , everyone 's living in their own tiny bubble of experiences and ideas , let it be their everyday lives , their closer community , their nation . . or even the `` world '' itself is just a tiny insignificant ball of rock and metal compared to the vastness of the universe . 
  i 'd wager this shortsightedness is integral to being human ( or sentinent for all we know ) , ca n't really just say one day `` hey let 's forget that , look at everything this other way '' and change ourselves on a whim . 
  there has to be some kind of outer impulse , a threat or vastly different/unexpected information , for us to change our views so drastically . 
  i ca n't really explain this properly but i hope you get what i 'm trying to say . 
  so let 's go with schultz . 
  but either way , it 's not like you have to choose between bad or worse , as had some others recently , luckily . 
   i think that in the future the whole world will work together and that nationalistic feelings will fade . 
  i 'd like it to be that way but there has to be something that replaces nationalistic feelings . 
  could the world look at itself in its own merit , without the comparative context of `` those others '' ? 
  i think our ideas and attitude would need to develop a lot , even in/for the first world that 's been through so much , let alone for the rest of humanity . 
  right , right . . reasonable . 
  well we shall see . 
  it 's the most serious/advanced organization of its kind at least . 
  will see how the model works out and if we 're strong enough to keep it up . 
  i read into that thread a bit and i thought he was exaggerating to make a point . 
  could be wrong . 
  i gave you my take on the question in another comment [ . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5srhx7/fresh_poll_on_hungarians_opinion_about_relation/ddhg9zu/?st=iyx2u7bv&amp;sh=636ab6a4 ) yeah there 's also tension with the topic but hey , at least we are able to create and maintain a discussion on the most controversial topic between our two nations without jumping at each other 's throats ( * cough * former yugo * cough * ) . 
  that 's something right ? 
  ( there was an edit :d ), 
  that user is a nice person . 
  i read these lines too , you know ? 
  i 100 % agree with what you 're saying here . 
  i have known people and have friends from transylvania as well as slovakia and it 's mostly just a way for politicians to trigger people detached from everyday life in there . 
  still , for some reason it 's always a hurting spot when it comes to theoretical discussion about the topic . 
  and for that / r/europe and the internet generally is a perfect place . 
  i 'm all for ce living in peace together but when it comes to debating the past , i do n't mind that either . 
  can not answer = not decided = do n't know ? 
  [ just as things should be . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5pdp51tnrk ) but nationalism in the xxi . 
  century is dated , nations are now way more interconnected than they were just half a century ago for it to be a reasonable alternative of further european integration . 
  it can only be viable for those who try to dismantle europe and hinder the natural process it has started , the one of unification . 
  you won , we lost . 
  shit happens . 
  got ta move on . 
  i was hoping for this sketch . 
  you know there 's a name problem when people of those countries mistake their own to the other . 
  just join v4 slovenia , we federalize and make ce great and unambiguous again !, 
  ( kinda ), 
  you know it 's easier for you to say that as the winners with the territory within their borders . 
   of course we would n't complain either if it was the other way around . 
  it 's funny you say that since it would 've been the same ordeal population-wise you got with transylvania but on a smaller scale . 
  also the rest of the territories would 've been almost entirely hungarian populated . 
  [ * k.u.k. 
  intensifies * ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/austria-hungaria_transparency.png ), 
  hungary was n't exactly a fully compiling , faithful ally to nazi germany . 
   hitler would soon have cause to rue his decision regarding the fate of carpatho-ukraine . 
  in six months , during his 1939 invasion of poland , the common polish-hungarian border would become of major importance ** when admiral horthy 's government , on the ground of long-standing polish-hungarian friendship , declined , as a matter of `` hungarian honor , '' [ 8 ] hitler 's request to transit german forces across carpathian rus into southeastern poland to speed that country 's conquest ** [ . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungary%e2%80%93poland_relations#world_war_ii )  the hungarian refusal allowed the polish government and tens of thousands of military personnel to escape into neighboring hungary and romania also one of the reasons nazi germany invaded hungary towards the end of wwii was their reluctance to commit `` properly '' ( that 's ugly to write but you get the point ) to holocaust in hungary under horthy ( who they replaced with right wingers of the arrow cross party after they invaded ) . 
  -- i do n't doubt that it was a `` natural '' result of the war ( although it 'd be interesting to think about why austria-hungary was so severely punished and germany left mostly intact ) , nor mind what the plebistice would 've resulted in . 
  it 's just the notion i can not agree with , as i mentioned above , that his comment implies . 
  it was n't the entire transylvanian population that chose this . 
  [ there was room for middle ground kind of deals . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4ehhygn.png ) it was the allies that decided it to be this way . 
  hungary got punished big time . 
  they got invaded by nazi germany after failing to manage a deal with the allies , like romania , so they lost the war . 
  that 's all . 
  well good luck to you . 
  those recent protests across whole romania were a good step forward . 
  just keep your voices loud . 
   ** they did n't technically lose ** , there was a romanian majority under foreign leaders . 
  ** they chose to join romania ** . 
  this was your original comment on hungary losing territory due to the decisions of the treaty . 
  i ca n't explain this more thoroughly . 
  so you kind of have the same `` no good choice '' deal as we do in hungary then . 
  [ this churchill quote pops in mind . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75oun5gvdau&amp;t=3m14s ) how can the people win ? 
  it 's the notion that the result was a democratic , free will sort of deal that the romanians advocated , instead of what it actually was , a punishment on hungary against the plebistice advocated by austria & hungary . 
  they could 've awarded territories more reasonably ( [ eg . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4ehhygn.png ) ) should they really cared about a fair treaty . 
  that 's not what happened . 
  i 'm unsure what that map represents exactly . 
  majority of supporters of current govt in red ?
