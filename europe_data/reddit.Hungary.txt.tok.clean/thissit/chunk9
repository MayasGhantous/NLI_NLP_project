  * resists the bait * :p, 
  i 'm guessing because you showed that hungarians lived and still live abroad ... ( i hope i have reason to / s ) [ pov as i 'm writing this . 
  when i edited it was on -1 after like 20 minutes . 
  it does n't matter that much but found it amusing that * facts * get downvoted so strongly when it does n't fit people 's narrative . 
  in 1920 you were n't in a position to project power as much as russia does now . 
  you were given a huge chunk of land with significant hungarian and german minorities , the allies punished us . 
  you came out of the war as victors ** because your secret deal to join the allies towards the end was successful while ours was n't ** . 
  you got reinforced while we got invaded by nazi germany as a result . 
   however , horthy 's reluctance to contribute to the german war effort and the holocaust in hungary , coupled with attempts to strike a secret deal with the allies of world war ii , eventually led the germans to invade and take control of the country in march 1944 in operation margarethe . 
  in october 1944 , horthy announced that hungary had declared the armistice to the allies and withdrawn from the axis . 
  that 's all there is to this whole ordeal really . 
  shit ( and history ) happens . 
  also note that 's a 2001-2002 map . 
  [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/ethnographic_map_of_hungary_1910_by_teleki_carte_rouge.jpg/1024px-ethnographic_map_of_hungary_1910_by_teleki_carte_rouge.jpg ) is according the official 1910 austro-hungarian census , you can clearly see the difference . 
   miller , vol . 
  document 246 . 
  `` outline of tentative report and recommendations prepared by the intelligence section , in accordance with instructions , for the president and the plenipotentiaries 21 january 1919 . '', 
  it 's right in the paragraph ... 
  it 's funny how you 're trying to invalidate that one with that argument though , when you started out with an `` according to others '' kind of deal just prior . 
   the romanian majority , where they were a majority , which is most of the territory , did decide . 
  it 's a historical fact how the treaty was decided , see above . 
  period . 
  i do n't know why you 're trying to get this through . 
  and again , [ that 's not how it happened during the treaty . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_trianon )  `` during prior negotiations , the hungarian party , along with the austrian , advocated the american principle of self-determination : that the population of disputed territories should decide by free plebiscite to which country they wished to belong . 
  [ 20 ] [ 21 ] this view did not prevail for long , as it was disregarded by the decisive french and british delegates . '', 
  * others * ^ [ who ? ], 
  i 'm guessing romanian sources . 
  historically there have always been significant hungarian & german populations in transylvania . 
  the point still stands whether there were 100k more or less of them at the time . 
  also you did n't address the original point . 
  it was n't up to the people to decide who to join , even though * austria and hungary * advocated it . 
  yeah we do n't . 
  that 's like saying you love filling your parliament with the most corrupt politicans in europe . 
   they did n't technically lose , there was a romanian majority under foreign leaders . 
  they chose to join romania . 
  [ except that 's not how it happened . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_trianon ) `` during prior negotiations , the hungarian party , along with the austrian , advocated the american principle of self-determination : that the population of disputed territories should decide by free plebiscite to which country they wished to belong . 
  [ 20 ] [ 21 ] this view did not prevail for long , as it was disregarded by the decisive french and british delegates . '', 
  `` the allies assigned territories that were mostly populated by non-hungarian ethnicities to successor states , but also allowed these states to absorb sizeable territories that were mainly inhabited by hungarian-speaking populations . 
  for instance , romania gained all of transylvania , which was home to 2,800,000 romanians , but also contained a significant minority of 1,600,000 magyars and about 250,000 germans . 
  [ 25 ] the intent of the allies was principally to strengthen these successor states at the expense of hungary . 
  although the countries that were the main beneficiaries of the treaty partially noted the issues , the hungarian delegates tried to draw attention to them . 
  their views were disregarded by the allied representatives . '', 
  -- edit : bring on the downvotes for facts . 
  sorry it does n't fit your `` romania is always righteous & innocent and hungary is pure evil '' narrative . 
  it seems to be one of those things that absolutely dominate the landscape without ruining it . 
   mostly they just reaped what the carthaginians , egyptians , persians , greeks and so own had sown https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9foi342lxqe,

  [ deja vu ] ( http://pix.avaxnews.com/avaxnews/f3/13/000013f3_medium.jpeg ), 
  i see colours, 
  it was meant with a / s tag tho, 
  * applauds in latin *, 
  `` a l\u00f3 '' means `` a horse '' but i doubt anyone would misunderstand an `` alo '' like that . 
  we answer with hall\u00f3 . 
  now you 're leaving hungarian history but we all know * extra hungariam non est vita , si est vita non est ita * . 
  yeah they both mean thanks :p, 
   it also does n't help that 's it 's in the middle of romania either yeah , about that ... 
  you just take stuff for granted !, 
  it 's nice to see you guys often [ praise it ] ( https://i.imgur.com/nyvzm3d.gif ), 
  i opened this out of context and thought it was some kind of jewellery on first glance, 
  pro patria et libertate ( i know the historic context and idea between these two are the exact opposite ), 
  people must feel weird being born in november . 
  nice , it reminded me of ancient carthaginian ( punic ) alphabet and what do you know , [ it 's kind of similar to old hungarian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/punic_language#phonology ) as well . 
  apart from * escargot *, 
  ca n't you see the millions of africans dying within our borders ? 
  rip pontus , i really liked your colour in centurion : defender of rome i think i 'm gon na start a ckii game with `` pontus '' now . 
  for 3 months in the first and 18 days in the second :o), 
  that 's kinda poetic, 
  this time we 're different in being hungary by not being different . 
   poland : luty fun fact , * lutyok/latyak * means [ shitty semi-melted snow in hungarian ] ( http://www.somogyma.hu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/latyak-1440x564_c.jpg ), 
  i 'd say pretty badass yeah, 
  yeah , `` ssz '' although it 's not a letter on its own . 
  it 's two `` sz '' together just like '' \u00df '' is a double `` s '' in german . 
  fun fact , old hungarian ( that our nomadic ancestors brought in with them ) [ used runes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_hungarian_alphabet ) .

  that 's like `` normie '' indonesiaball, 
  do you recall any massive protests in belgium against his deeds ? 
  do n't think so . 
  [ we 're pretty good at protesting tho ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sizqcw5.jpg ) , so long as it 's about vital stuff like the internet , 
  belgium 's gotten away with this big time . 
  this time they even cut half of the eu out so there 's that,
