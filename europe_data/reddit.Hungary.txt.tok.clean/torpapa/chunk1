stop talking in memes . 
  it makes you looks silly , not superior . 
  elementary school and primary school are the same . 
  the two are constantly conflated in german media . 
  europe = eu for them . 
  `` mehr europa '' ( more europe ) is a positive phrase that appears a lot and it directly * means * more centralized power to the eu . 
  you almost never hear `` eu '' ( only in specific things ) , generally they just say `` europa '' . 
  august 20 is the official `` main '' national day when there is only enough room to list one date . 
  but that 's just formalities . 
  march 15 , aug 20 and oct 23 have approx . 
  equal importance . 
  adding to istencsaszar 's comment , in hungary over 90 % of people / families own the house / flat they live in . 
  only students and some young people rent . 
  every organism alive today [ descends from a common ancestor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evidence_of_common_descent ) so all animals , plants etc. 
  are various kinds of cousins . 
  cuz he 's the smartest man alive !, 
  that 's not true . 
  for example , think of what if she never had kids . 
  i am not sure if you have that 100g = price thing in hungary too we do , but it seems to be overlooked by most people . 
  perhaps it 's easier to trick us than germans ... 
  and - ul / \u00fcl ( e.g. 
  aj\u00e1nd\u00e9kul ) and - k\u00e9nt and some more . 
  there are 25 listed [ here ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/appendix:hungarian_suffixes#case_endings ), 
  hungarian consumers are extremely price sensitive too ( because people have little money ) . 
  and this results in trickeries you never see in germany : almost everything has a reduced quantity from the `` expected '' size . 
  while in germany you have 500 g yoghurt , here we have 390 g or 450 g ones in deceivingly shaped containers . 
  instead of 200 g ones we have 150-175 g. sliced salami 80-90 g instead of 100 g . the shape and size still looks similar . 
  the reduction has happened gradually over the years and is present across all product categories . 
  germans seem to be very sensitive about the actual price per size as well , while hungarians perhaps do n't notice these gradual reductions in size , as long as the price is almost the same . 
  i do n't know what germans do to have cheaper * and * higher quality stuff , but it 's a very curious and interesting issue that would need some deeper investigation . 
  but it 's not really cheaper . 
  it 's rather that consumers here are n't as `` consious '' and do n't really know the alternative . 
  many people here do n't travel regularly , and even those that do , do n't do side by side comparisons . 
  i guess , though higher wealth over the last few decades , western europeans have developed higher quality expectations than eastern europeans . 
  it 's also more important for a brand what people say and think about them in the richer countries . 
  then even if it 's lower quality here in the eastern parts , since people look up to the west , the reputation of the brand will radiate over to here . 
  the article says it 's in bad taste because this word has a special meaning in european history , obviously referring to the liberation of countries from german occupation after wwii .

  nah , we did have it and called it `` h\u00e1z '' ( house ) . 
  if you were in there , then you could n't be caught . 
  but you also could n't stay there for an unlimited time . 
  we either drew a circle on the ground or we chose a big tree and you had to touch it to be `` in '' the house . 
  it 's possible to play the game for much longer this way because people have some time to rest . 
  so now liberation can only be used for liberation from the nazis ? 
  they were so often replaced with \u00f5 and \u00fb . fortunately now unicode is widespread ( some shitty sites and software still do n't handle it right , though ) . 
  here is [ a price comparison ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=netherlands&amp;country2=hungary&amp;city1=amsterdam&amp;city2=budapest&amp;tracking=getdispatchcomparison ) between amsterdam and budapest . 
  things are cheaper here , but that 's only about a factor of 1.5-2 . 
  and prices are pretty much the same for clothes , cars , electronics and such . 
  and of course prices are precisely equal when we go on vacation in other countries . 
  at the same time , dutch salaries are about 4-5 times higher ( but if we compare the relatively poorer people of both countries , the difference would be even higher ) . 
  a lot of the misunderstandings and miscommunication across the populations within the eu comes from this fact that people with very different financial situation have very different daily concerns and lifestyles . 
  it 's strange that you do n't know about the large wage gap between eastern and western europe . 
  the prices are of course also different , but only in certain types of things . 
  3-4 eur is also average in hungary . 
  the difference from the us is that here people do n't have to pay an arm and a leg for health care and education . 
  services are also somewhat cheaper , but not as much . 
  the remaining difference means average people ca n't regularly go out to just eat at a restaurant , they ca n't go for vacation , they have almost no money saved up for harsher times , they are sometimes late with paying the bills etc. 
  felvid\u00e9k basically means uplands or upper lands ( since it 's a mounainous area up north ) , it 's not actually `` upper hungary '' . 
  same origin . 
  both come from a slavic language . 
  or rather soviet-annexed , since other countries like hungary were also under soviet occupation , but not incorporated into the soviet union , so a distinction is useful . 
  would `` the former soviet-occupied lithuania '' sound better ? 
  but some people may have no idea where it is . 
  in hungary they are usually described as baltic in a followup sentence , something like `` there was a big snowstorm in latvia . 
  the baltic country experiences a very cold winter this year . '', 
  no they are mean ( average ) faces , not eigenfaces . 
  it 's also only by prescription in hungary ( and i assume it always has been , since such a thing existed ) . 
  hungarn ? 
  i most surprised by the fact that the prime minister has the courage to talk to regular citizens on tv and answer critical questions . 
  this would never happen in hungary . 
  there has not even been a single tv debate between leading politicians since more than 10 years . 
  it 's not an emotional thing for my generation ( i 'm 28 ) . 
  and looking back , the change of system was executed in a pretty bad way . 
  lot of state companies were privatised by corrupt people , the former state party made a comeback , many people high in power since then have had connections to the communist past . 
  the legacy of the mentality that people developed throughout those decades is still with us . 
  i feel like this song shows a kind of idealization that never really was so around here . 
  the only change that people really wanted was having access to western products and higher salaries . 
  overall my feeling about it can be summed up as `` kitsch '' . 
  we were around 20-25 in primary school and around 35 in secondary school . 
  0.37 % , min . 
  10 $ , max . 
  if we consider income after taxes per person in household , the median is around 240 $ / month . 
  according to a survey , people around that income say `` an average level life '' would require 350 $ . 
  for people who are between 80-90 % on the income distribution ( so taking away to richest 10 % and the poorest 80 % ) , the income is still just around 430 $ / month/person in household . 
  these people are richer than 80-90 % of the hungarian population , but they still make a ridiculously low amount of money compared to western europe . 
  and absolutely no fucking way prices would make up for that . 
  almost everything that you spend on if you have this kind of money has almost the same price as in western eu ( or more expensive , partly due to the high , 27 % vat ) . 
  average hungarians ( and other eastern central europeans ) have totally different concerns in life than western europeans . 
  ( [ hungarian source ] ( http://www.origo.hu/gazdasag/20160303-kereset-jovedelem-median-decimalis-atlagkereset-minimalber-ksh-eurostat.html ) ), 
  but money is shit in hungary . 
  if someone does n't have any family ties , linguistic and cultural connection , friendship connections to hungary , they would be out of their mind to want to stay here ( especially if they are short on money ) . 
  welfare is very low here . 
  and if they raised it specifically for the migrants to the same level as in germany , then what do you think would working hungarians say about that ? 
  because the * average * net salary in many hungarian counties is lower than german welfare ( hartz iv ) ( no the price difference is very very * very * far from making up for it , prices are almost the same ) . 
  shoud n't be free here in hungary . 
  my experience with free toilets is that they are absolutely disgusting ( shit and pee everywhere ) , unmaintained and homeless people use them as shelter . 
  the paid toilets are usually clean . 
  paying about 100 huf ( 0.32 eur ) is perfectly fine . 
  also some people in this thread do n't understand what these public toilets are .
