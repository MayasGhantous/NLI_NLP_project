  we are not talking about the toilet in some other place , like in a shopping mall or restaurant or other store or hospital etc. 
  those are all free around here . 
  the paid toilets are only the `` standalone '' toilets that are not connected to any other business , they are simply toilets out there in the city . 
  no , you pay for using a cleaned toilet that requires money to be maintained . 
  i do n't understand how `` free public toilet '' does n't set off the usual `` omg socialism ! '', 
  alarm for americans , but free healthcare or education does . 
  flowing water and clean toilets are a service . 
  sleep is also a bodily function and if you do n't sleep you die , but hotels are n't free . 
   you 're forgetting that you can practice the language with native speakers on public transport . 
  what 's the point of learning the language if you are n't going to speak to anybody ? 
  we do n't really talk to strangers here in hungary ( i think many parts of europe are similar ) . 
  it happens in rural places but in a city people want to be left alone , especially when they are still half asleep in the morning and when they are tired after work . 
  most strangers who talk to others are either very old and senile or crazy or want to scam you . 
   public transport is definitely faster , but people who live in public transport cities and have not lived in car cities frequently believe that driving would be faster . 
  i 'm comparing public transport in budapest vs car in budapest . 
  car is much faster except if you compare it with the metro . 
  public transport takes about double the time if you include the waiting and walking to and from the stop ( you might have to change lines 2 or 3 times to get to the far end of the city ) . 
  no , sorry neighbors . 
  yeah , but it takes time . 
  this thread was about learning the local language and how people rather spend their leftover time on family and friends than language learning because there 's not enough external pressure . 
  so : sure you can study the language on the bus or train if you 're lucky and can have a seat . 
  also , having a car still makes things faster than public transport . 
  except if your home and workplace are both along a metro line , because that 's faster than driving in the rush hours . 
  but then the metro is not really the best studying environment . 
  i thought `` uncultured '' usually refers to `` high culture '' , literature , arts , history , etiquette , stuff like that . 
  most of the people you , as a tourist , see in the cozy inner city strolling around drinking coffee are not really on their way from home to work ... we also have big cities here in europe and unless you happen to live a few corners from your workplace , you still need to spend time on the bus or drive or ride your bike . 
  many people who live in villages work in the nearest town / city and take the bus ( 30-40 minutes are usual ) . 
  `` you can walk everywhere '' just means there are sidewalks and pedestrian infrastructure and if you really want , you * can * walk to anywhere in the city , but time is still an aspect , even in the more densely built cities we have ( compared to the us ) . 
  `` barbers '' as such do n't really exist . 
  we have `` fodr\u00e1szat '' , which is i guess best translated as `` hairdresser 's '' and they are also capable of shaving or trimming a beard i guess . 
  the few `` barber shops '' that are called as such are very new , they are marketed to hipsters and rich foreigners and have signs in english etc. 
  tipping is far from being exclusively american . 
  we also have it in hungary . 
  `` official language '' , as in the language of state administration . 
  it was never a real national language . 
  it also has little to do with the fact that pannonia was roman . 
  latin was the lingua franca of the time , even in places that were never part of the roman empire , like poland . 
  going back until 895 ( settlement of hungarians in the current place ) : yes , further back : no, 
  i think people say female because they do n't want to choose between girl and woman . 
  some female humans ( strongly correlating with age ) prefer one or the other . 
  we usually do some pre-drinking at home ( especially in winter ) , and then go to a club or bar , but it 's also not unusual to stay at someone 's place for the whole night . 
  it 's mostly a money thing for teens and that most places do n't serve you or let you in if you 're under 18 ( it 's not impossible though ) . 
  also , parents may let a 15-16 year old to someone 's place , but not to stay out in the bars/streets until dawn . 
  it usually does n't look like american movies since most people do n't live in villas with swimming pools . 
  edit : after reading the comments : it 's definitely for people you know or people your friends know . 
  definitely not open for ( half - ) strangers . 
  ( are house parties `` open '' in the us ? ), 
  they read it that way to make it easier for others to understand it , remember it , write it down etc. 
  i have an 's ' in my name which is correctly pronounced ` sh ' , but everyone abroad reads it like the english 's ' , so sometimes even i say it that way so they do n't get confused and stuff gets resolved quicker . 
  ( think doctor 's office , making an appointment somewhere over the phone etc. ), 
  at least at the main tech uni in budapest ( bme ) there 's an admission exam . 
  to simplify things , the admission exam for the master programme is the same as the final exam of the corresponding bachelor programme , so people who want to continue studying do n't have to take two exams . 
  this is a written exam and has several parts , covering many subfields of computer science . 
  i have no idea if there is any other process for foreigners . 
  i 've never heard any animals associated with it in hungarian . 
   can you confidently pronounce a surname from your country and say it correctly ? 
  yeah , most hungarian names are written using our normal phonetic spelling , so we basically pronounce it letter by letter ( you have to know which letter stands for which sound of course ) . 
  some names use an archaic , traditional spelling , but even those are quite predictable and we learn the most notable exceptions in school . 
  however , when someone 's family has already assimilated into a new country , i do n't expect them to keep the original pronunciation of their name . 
  for example nicolas sarkozy 's last name is originally s\u00e1rk\u00f6zy , which is pronounced somewhat like `` shark [ \u00f6 ] zee '' where \u00f6 is like the german \u00f6 ( somewhat like the vowel in french `` le '' ) . 
  but everyone calls him sarkozee . 
  or george soros ' name is pronounced as `` shorosh '' in hungarian . 
  but it 's no big deal , people ca n't be expected to be able to pronounce names from so many languages `` correctly '' . 
  budapest : there are some . 
  the streets right on the two banks of the danube are quite special because many are named after foreigners : * valdemar \u00e9s lina langlet rakpart * raoul wallenberg rakpart * jane haining rakpart * angelo rotta rakpart * bem rakpart ( j\u00f3zef bem ) * carl lutz rakpart * a few more there are some squares ( square = t\u00e9r ) named after european foreign figures : * bem t\u00e9r ( j\u00f3zef bem ) * k\u00e1lvin t\u00e9r ( john calvin ) * ii . 
  j\u00e1nos p\u00e1l p\u00e1pa t\u00e9r ( pope john paul ii ) also some more streets ( street = utca , way = \u00fat ) : * b\u00e9csi \u00fat ( vienna way ) * victor hugo utca * balzac utca until a few years ago there was also : * moszkva t\u00e9r ( moscow square ) * roosevelt t\u00e9r -- in szeged the ringroad is full of parts named after foreign cities , as a thanks for the help in the great szeged flood of 1879 : * r\u00f3mai k\u00f6r\u00fat ( k\u00f6r\u00fat = ringroad ) * p\u00e1rizsi k\u00f6r\u00fat * londoni k\u00f6r\u00fat * moszkvai k\u00f6r\u00fat ( moscow ) * b\u00e9csi k\u00f6r\u00fat ( vienna ), 
  saying `` good morning/etc '' when boarding at the front door is somewhat usual ( if the driver is not in [ a booth like this ] ( http://img7.indafoto.hu/7/3/91183_743bacdce24949454785a29463efdf6f/9965975_19e2e36a50ac9458b14a4b38dbb8c5df_xl.jpg ) ) . 
  budapest where i live is a big city so there 's too many people getting on and off the bus , there 's no time to talk to the driver . 
  it 's also better to leave through the back doors , so the front can be used by the people getting on the bus ( in case there 's ticket control by the driver , which is only the case on some lines ) . 
  also , even if we said something it would be a polite `` goodbye '' . 
  thanking seems a bit off , he 's just doing his job , it was no favor that he took you somewhere . 
  butter is the default to put on bread here . 
  that 's somehow the `` proper '' way to do it , we did it as kids in school , i learned it so at home and at my grandma 's . 
  it felt a bit like an exercise in patience , a ritual to me . 
  mustard and mayo are not `` spreads '' here . 
  instead of butter you can use lard ( fat ) , honey or jam ( although some/most people combine the latter two with butter as well ) . 
  seems normal , perhaps a bit too much of the exact same product . 
  in the very large stores ( `` hypermarket '' ) it 's like that here too , but in most places you 'd just have - counting only the front items on the shelves - 2 or 3 of the same product instead of 5-8 in the picture . 
  peanut butter is almost unknown here for most people . 
  but nutella is somewhat popular ( although i have n't eaten it in like 10 years and also do n't see it very often being bought by others at the checkout ) . 
  most start drinking at an age around 12-15 ( not counting the occasional tasting of beer or wine at the family table as a child ) . 
  but it 's only legal to get served alcohol from age 18 . 
  i think we could bring beer and wine down to 16 , as germany does it . 
  sure . 
  kids are n't given sharp things like knives or pieces of glass here . 
  they might cut themselves . 
   apparently romania loves lupa capitolina more than italy . 
  lol it 's to strengthen the perception of continuity from dacia province of the roman empire and today 's romania ( called the daco-roman hypothesis , the official historic interpretation by the romanian state ) , giving one of the major justifications for ruling over transylvania . 
  it 's a political and ideological thing and romania only started becoming obsessed with this statue at the rise of nationalism in the 19th century . 
  our national holidays are either sad or otherwise serious , so only new year 's eve is an `` official '' party night . 
  this of course does n't decrease our party life the least bit , but students and dormitories often create their own traditions , so there are party reasons , just not on national holidays . 
  now to your actual question : only halloween , and to a small extent in recent years : st. patrick 's day . 
   was it a separate class or part of , say , biology classes ? 
  it was mostly in biology class . 
  the biology of sexual organs , conception , childbirth and lots of different methods of contraception were normal part of the curriculum ( i.e. 
  in the book , workbook and we wrote tests about it ) . 
  it included many things , like how boys often ejaculate in sleep and stuff like that . 
  one useful thing we learned was that it 's no big deal if you do n't shower every day ( like if you 're out camping or something ) , but you should at least wash your genitals with warm water . 
  this was around age 13-14 . 
  there was also a separate class for only girls .
