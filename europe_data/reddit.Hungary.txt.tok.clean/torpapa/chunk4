  or people who play board games . 
  they are also seen as manchildren . 
  on an instinctive level , a gamer reminds people of a socially underdeveloped `` outcast '' , who is not a good person to associate with , because it would risk one 's own status . 
  these hobbies are all about `` staying sitting in the cave '' , there 's no physical risk taking in it , which is an important part of young masculinity , nor is there the not-giving-a-fuck coolness of the older , alpha-style masculinity ( because of the effort spent on the hobby and taking it very seriously ) . 
  there are other hobbies that take a lot of effort but are n't stigmatized like that because a `` sensible '' purpose can be seen in it . 
  for example people who spend a lot of money on car stuff or watches etc. 
  spend it to gain better status . 
  people who spend hours a day to learn to play the guitar do it so they can be entertaining in a socially interactive way . 
  gym rats are seen somewhat negatively but people easily understand their motivation . 
  there is also something paradoxical about hardcore gaming . 
  for `` normal people '' , gaming is something like an occasional short enjoyment , that 's difficult to reconcile with spending so much effort on it . 
  imagine there was a hobby of taking relaxing baths in your home bathtub , where people would spend tons of money on different products , spend a lot of time learning about temperatures and water levels in the bathtub and humidity , different types of baths ( like long , short , reheating the water x times etc ) . 
  it would be seen as weird . 
  cheap chinese clothing/shoe stores , chinese buffets , turkish kebab places . 
  well , this was the attitude of some of my english teachers . 
  they were mostly old-fashioned , conservative , prussian-style teachers , not the young , hip and modern kind ( although i had one like that too , but he was an exception and left the public education system quite quickly ) . 
  the biggest is in the making since 2005 . 
  six volumes have been published , they go alphabetically and have covered about 15,000 words , the last one being `` ekvivalens '' , so there 's still a lot to do . 
  yeah , but british english is associated with higher culture and has more prestige , while american english is associated with mcdonald 's , hollywood action movies , rap etc. 
  that the conservative education system does n't like as much . 
  we learn the british pronunciation in school . 
  i mean the audio exercises and our books were in the british variant , but of course the teachers spoke with a quite strong hungarian accent . 
  now i speak an inconsistent mix of many variants . 
  i say `` dance '' in the american way , but perhaps sometimes i say `` ca n't '' in the british way i think . 
  i should probably just stick to one or the other . 
  i think average people only know about kurds from the news . 
  i mean that part of news that 's almost like background noise now , some middle eastern conflict , stuff blew up , suicide bombers , car bomb , protests , whatever . 
  it 's washed together in our minds with all the other usual `` desert war/conflict '' news from the region . 
  and in hungarian `` fika '' means `` booger '' . 
  also , the daco-roman continuity theory is just one hypothesis , but one that is firmly supported by the romanian state and education system . 
  it 's an important component in their `` romania is the rightful owner of transylvania '' - argument . 
  * knowing the gender of each word is hard . 
  also , when speaking , if i do n't yet know which noun to use , i must already decide the gender , like `` ich sehe diesen/diese/dieses gro\u00dfe rote ( ... ) '' , i ca n't postpone thinking about the word to the end , like i could do in other languages , i must know its gender to decide if it 's diesen/diese/dieses . 
  * word order peculiarities like `` er gibt * dem mann das buch * '' , but `` er gibt * es ihm * '' * pronunciation of r , as in `` rot '' ( hungarian has a trilled r , like spanish ) , also the hard ch sound . 
  mainly : does it get an umlaut ? 
  is it '' - en '' or just '' - e '' ? 
  am i sure it 's not h\u00fcnde ? 
  or hunden ? 
  ( i know the rule , but it 's difficult when i have to speak fast ) * i sometimes forget to add `` sich '' in sentences like `` wir werden mit den anderen leuten [ ... ermm ... ] treffen [ schei\u00dfe , i should have added an ` uns ' after ` werden ' but it 's too late now ] '' here again , one has to know already if the verb uses `` sich '' or not , so even though the verb comes late in the sentence , i ca n't simply decide the verb immediately before saying it , i must know it beforehand . 
  it can mean both . 
  for example if you say `` keleti mot\u00edvumok '' ( eastern [ graphical ] patterns ) , it 's probably about islamic and indian art . 
  but perhaps not . 
  it 's hard to say . 
  actually , seen from here , arab , indian and far-east asian cultures blur into a combined vague stereotype . 
  while `` orient\u00e1lis '' exists as a word in hungarian , it 's not really used . 
  we usually use `` keleti '' ( eastern ) or `` keleties '' ( approx . 
  `` easternish '' ) instead . 
  it 's huge . 
  hungarians ( generally speaking ) have a national pride in the olympic achievements compared to the population size . 
  the winter olympics are basically as good as non-existent for most people . 
  we have no big mountains , we are not big on winter sports and many ( most ? ), 
  people would struggle to name a single hungarian athlete who competes in the winter olympics . 
  meh , we ( our family ) usually do . 
  we are forgetful people and often have to come back from the door to pick something up , or just jump in to take something ( like a bill to be paid ) and leave . 
  we have easy-to-clean floor tiles in the living room ( for a rough idea , it 's somewhat [ like this ] ( http://www.myaustinelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/rustic-with-marble-tile-flooring-ideas-for-living-room.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.myaustinelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/minimalist-cream-colored-tile-flooring-ideas-for-living-room.jpg ) in the places where we are fine with shoes ) . 
  and we have laminate floor in the bedrooms , not carpets , but bedrooms are mostly no-shoe areas ( except if you need to catch a bus and have no time etc. ) . 
  if you did n't just step in a pile of poo before , it 's not a big deal . 
  there 's a doormat too . 
  we obviously do n't do it if there 's snowy or rainy weather . 
  however , this is not typical for hungary and i do take my shoes off in other people 's homes . 
  i open it at the end , at the peak , the non-stem side . 
  pinch it and open symmetrically . 
  learned it this way from my parents as a kid . 
  it 's not a life-hack or trick , i never knew there was another way until i read it on the internet . 
  having the ( often somewhat heavy ) stem hang on one side seems suboptimal to me . 
  it 's much better used as a `` handle '' . 
  someone in his party . 
  the news do n't say who it was . 
  our pm , viktor orb\u00e1n is all about power , not really money . 
  he has millionaire oligarchs around him , but he himself is n't a very rich man . 
  hungary has historically been a `` melting pot '' as well . 
  little of our genes actually come from the original hungarians who settled here over a 1000 years ago . 
  everyone has some slovak , german , romanian , serb , jewish , cuman , jassic etc. 
  so there 's nothing special about it . 
  even among far-right people this is not taboo . 
  the chairman of the biggest far-right party for example has slovak ancestors on his mother 's side and it 's not an issue . 
  because all of us have . 
  hungary has had a very eventful history with lots of wars and lots of depopulation and repopulation from surrounding areas . 
  kings used to invite foreigners ( for example germans , cumans etc ) to settle and work in hungary . 
  having some ancestry from slavic countries , germany and romania is the norm here . 
  but we consider that to be our ancestry , not what we are now . 
  nobody would say you 're a serb because you come from an originally serb family but for several generations they speak hungarian and participate in hungarian culture . 
  but if your family recently immigrated from faraway lands that 's more unusual for sure and it may take some time and mixing until the family is considered hungarian by the general population . 
  i guess it 's subjective . 
  i find it interesting to learn about . 
  even if there 's nothing exotic about the result , it 's interesting to read old documents and see that some lived near debrecen , some were donauschwaben germans etc. 
  it 's a connection with history . 
  interesting to contemplate and imagine how they might have lived like as peasants etc. 
   we europeans be more specific . 
  around here there 's no triggering about it . 
  it 's an interesting thing . 
  most of us hungarians have slovak , serb , german , romanian etc. 
  i find it interesting to know that one side of my family were german donauschwaben from budapest ( at that time budapest was majority german-speaking ) . 
  talking about genealogy does n't mean you want to kill everyone without pure blood . 
  if anywhere , in hungary it 's clear that nobody is `` pure hungarian '' , there was so much mixing . 
  basically half the country has a surname like horv\u00e1th ( croat ) , t\u00f3th ( slovak ) , n\u00e9meth ( german ) , ol\u00e1h ( romanian ) , r\u00e1cz ( serb ) , lengyel ( pole ) , t\u00f6r\u00f6k ( turk ) . 
  even the far right party 's leader 's mother 's side were originally slovaks . 
  yep , it 's more typical for the 50 + year-old generations . 
  and as for double , combined names we have annam\u00e1ria . 
  if i remember well , barbarossaplatz is quite a popular name for squares in german cities .
