  the majority of the asylum seekers get rejected as well , so you 're just splitting hairs here . 
  by the way : i read the uk will only accept 20k asylum seekers , and only from camps in syria and hand picking the ones with useful skills/education and only over , and 20k only by 2020 so you got only a couple thousand per year ... more arrived on a daily basis at the hungarian serbian border this year . 
  so the uk really is a role model we can all look up to . 
  why is any nation criticized for defending its borders ? 
  why is merkel not complaining then for example to the usa about how hard it is for mexicans to get through to the usa ? 
  for your information , it 's already been happening : http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/610602/migrants-deported-asylum-seekers-theresa-may, 
  it does n't matter if we get nuanced or not : the refugees interpreted merkel 's words as an invitation . 
  http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/10/angela-merkel-welcomes-refugees-to-germany-despite/?page=all and even if you were right ( you are not ) , no one gives a shit about how armchair intellectuals in their ivory tower can get more nuanced and accurate about semantics . 
   you 're either a liar with a very low opinion of this community or so misinformed it hurts . 
  that 's not what merkel `` wants '' , that 's what the eu-wide rule has been for years according to the dublin agreement . 
  it 's the exact thing that merkel wants to change and is currently getting shit for by people like you . 
  how is that a lie ? 
  merkel did ask orban , and that ** would be ** required by dublin indeed if hungary was a point of entry to the eu for all refugees . 
  however the problem with that is that hungary is ** not ** an entry point for most of the refugees so dublin should not apply to hungary . 
  greece is the entry point for refugees coming from serbia to hungary . 
  and that is the main route ( well , was until we closed that by fences ) . 
  so why is merkel not blaming greece for not doing shit about dublin ? 
  why attack hungary for that ? 
  and let 's stop for a moment and think about how insane dublin is : after merkel invites all syrians only the eu border countries should deal with all the shit merkel caused ? 
  just because there is a stupid agreement made back in 1990 when no one could have thought of this nightmare merkel brought upon europe ? 
   no one `` invited '' them , dipshit . 
  you can lie all you want , it does not matter . 
  the whole world knows , and that 's what matters . 
  just take a look at the refugees who have merkel pictures all over the camps and shouting `` merkel merkel '' , and none of them will stop until they reach germoney . 
  why do you think that is ? 
   exactly , and refugee quotas are a decision made by the eu , not by germany . 
  you said it wrong , not me . 
  we accepted it , did n't we ? 
  but we do not agree with it . 
  merkel invited these people , why should all members suffer ? 
  because germany is a big bully ? 
  so you have no moral principles and you just say `` tough shit '' to other eu members , but when it comes to refugees you are all about moral principles and everybody is welcome ? 
   you asked why hungary ca n't decide that by itself , i told you why . 
  you do n't like it ? 
  tough shit . 
  you 're going to have to deal with the reality that exists , just like everyone else in the world . 
  not everything is up to the eu to decide , still most of the power is kept at national level . 
  merkel bullying the smaller eu countries into suffering the consequences of her own irresponsible idiocy will not work . 
   `` can not even dare '' ? 
  how delusional do you have to be to arrive at a point where you think that literally the entire world secretly agrees with you , and everyone who does n't is just pretending because he 's afraid to speak up ? 
  that 's quite literally insane . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  how is that in any way an answer to what i wrote ? 
  germany is not the eu . 
  and merkel did not discuss anything with eu leaders , just announced that all syrians are welcome . 
  and then she tries to dump them on other eu countries ? 
  not even asking for any opinion ? 
  and you want to be rude and tough to the eu members while can not even dare to say anything but `` welcome all '' with a smile to the refugees ? 
  merkel wanted us to register all of them and keep them in hungary until they are registered ( forever ) . 
  no thanks . 
  you invited them , please do not try to dump the problem on us . 
  but why give up principles now ? 
  why not just not let in refugees in the first place and we would n't be in this mess ? 
  maybe you get rid of merkel and we will have an eu-wide deal in 24 hours ? 
  ;-) or just popular demand to force merkel to put common sense before emotions ... 
  i do n't know , but what i do know is this : ** we do not have 50 years , hell 50 weeks to solve this **, 
  safe country means nothing now to turkey , they demand visa free entry and eu membership in the close future . 
  by the way , what is the point of declaring countries safe/not safe if those countries can simply blackmail us and we simply yield ? 
  we can deport them back to syria and close the borders . 
  easy . 
  all right let me get this straight : the problem is that around 1 million muslims are flooding germany this year only because merkel invited them . 
  merkel 's solution ? 
  ** let 's grant visa free entry into the eu for a muslim country with population of 80 million **, 
  we really love merkel danke sch\u00f6n !, 
  why has she no other way ? 
  seriously ? 
  here 's an idea germany : why not a fence all the way on the schengen borders ? 
  with a serious border patrol ? 
  and we all would finance it together ? 
  instead of this kindergarten of first calling nazis or xenophobes those who build a fence but when the migrants arrive to your country doing it yourselves to the detriment of everyone else around you in the eu ? 
  of course , i would start with not inviting all syrians to germany in the first place , but it is too late now so let 's move on ... 
  i hope merkel will not offer eu membership for turkey in exchange for help in dealing with migrants . 
  would not surprise me if she did, 
  when you join a union of 20 something countries that has been existing for 60-70 years , they are not going to revise their already iron clad rules just to accomodate your needs . 
  you accept these rules or do not join . 
  that 's how it was for hungary in 2004 when we joined the eu . 
  but even if we could revise schengen ( it 's is clear at this point it is every country 's interest we should ) hungary would have little say in it given the small size of our country . 
  so an unfair burden on hungary seems really likely in that scenario . 
  what i think would make common sense is a usa-like common border patrol financed by not the border countries but the common eu budget since it would protect the entire eu not just the bordering countries . 
  as a hungarian from my point of view what would a common asylum policy have achived ? 
  germany is the biggest power so probably someone like merkel would have been in charge of it ( of course it would have been eu-level democratic , but still ) : that would mean hungary had to deal with all this shit just because of our geographic location . 
  merkel insisted we should register all migrants and keep them in hungary until they are registered ( forever ) in early september when the influx increased heavily . 
  what do you think how attractive is this option to hungarians ? 
  it 's 2 different people who wrote those . 
  so nothing `` become '' something else, 
  doing nothing ? 
  hungarians bled heavily to protect european borders , sometimes we lost , sometimes we won . 
  `` streamrolled '' is only true for mongols , but hell , they defeated china with no big effort years before , europe would have been an easy ride if they really wanted it . 
  maybe if they fucked up sweden at the time , you would see it differently today . 
  turks were stopped at hungary , and our country was split into 3 parts , only one of which was under turkish rule . 
  but for example before that hungary defeated the turks under matthias corvinus who was a powerful king . 
  after his death , hungary went into chaos unfortunately and today : we are defending the eu schengen borders since greece does not lift a finger to do so . 
  do we want you to kiss our asses for it ? 
  of course not , but at least you could stop spitting on us and call us racist and xenophobs at every turn just for protecting our national ( and at the same time eu ) borders . 
  poland , czech rep. sent reinfrocements for example , we appreciate that . 
  you guys come across as typical western ivory tower/armchair arrogant and ignorant , but i believe slowly but surely you will learn that we were right ... of course by that time it will be too late , a rude awakening for you, 
  what a surprise after uncontrolled mass immigration . 
  your leaders asked for this, 
  in the usa it is enough just to look `` arabic '' to be denied entry to the country . 
  europe is rich but weak,
