  i am travelling so can not type much but you are completely wrong about merkel , the numbers did increase significantly after she announced that all syrians are welcome . 
  i saw it in budapest , youtube is also full of migrants shouting `` merkel merkel '' and pictures of her are everywhere in their camps . 
  the rest of your comment is even worse, 
  so that is the `` thank you '' from 2015 's western europe for trying to defend europe from the turks for centuries . 
  i guess then we should have just let them through to rape your grand grand grand mother and then i could call your people `` quasi-turkish '' tribe . 
  you were just lucky to be too far from real danger , the mongols , turks ... the mongols could have easily annex all of europe back in the 13th century , you were just lucky the khan died so they had to move back right after they attacked hungary ... 
  jesus what a poor comment, 
  thank you - i already confessed on reddit several times that i fell in love with croatia instantly back in 2012 \u2665, 
  like an american fellow just noted here , many states would secede from the usa right now if they could get away with it . 
  i know texans openly dislike and go against the federal government . 
  yes merkel does have a huge responsibility in the current crisis . 
  i believe her actions were reckless , emotion based , dangerous and flat out stupid . 
  immigrants in the usa are a totally different story , you can not compare to the current european migrant crisis . 
  the usa would have never let in these migrants ... 
  you can imagine i was relying heavily on the car 's gps so i went through a lot of `` old roads '' as well , but eventually you need to use some highways in croatia . 
  on the plus side the roads themselves are in good condition . 
  in any case i have been spending the summers for the last 4 years in croatia and not planning to give up this habit soon ... 
  they call us continental europe . 
  but if the english do n't consider themselves part of europe why not just call us europe ? 
  mainly because he is drunk all the time, 
  yeah we get that but the amount of money they get from tourism - and you should see those endless lines of cars not moving while the sun is beating down heavily . 
  not cool croatia !, 
  in hungary you can pay with your phone for the toll road and it 's done , no booths stopping you anywhere . 
  or just buy a sticker on a petrol station if it 's easier for you ... 
  calm down , no need for that language . 
  the refugees/migrants move ** away ** themselves from italy and hungary , their goal it to get to germoney . 
  it is their decision , not ours . 
  germany invited them anyway so why do they want to send them back to us now all of a sudden ? 
  mutti is waiting , no ? 
  this german quota system is stupid as we do n't even know how many there are/will come , but regardless it would force some of them back to hungary . 
  that is a nazi move . 
  we hungarians feel it would be against basic human rights to force any refugee to stay in any one place when he wants to go to another . 
  we are happy to even pay for their travel , just get the hell out . 
  we could still veto that ( like texas would say fuck you to obama ) . 
  but we would have common fiscal and foreign policy . 
  we need to strike a balance here, 
  it is beautiful , when i show pics to friends they think i was in hawaii or something . 
  nope , just drove down south a couple hundred kilometers , that 's it . 
  an advice : avoid croatian highways as long as you can ( go through slovenia ) as they have toll roads causing incredibly long traffic jams on their highways . 
  i mean i love croatians but if your main income is from tourism how can you do this to tourists ? 
  the problem is you are nothing on the global market as romania or transylvania . 
  even germany is too small to matter . 
  only together can we attain serious bargaining power on the global market - the total eu gdp is bigger than that of the usa . 
  so while i agree with your point and do not want brussels to dictate how i should live in budapest , a common eu government would be okay by me if we can still decide our small matters locally . 
  exactly . 
  asians feels so alien , europeans do n't . 
  i had this strange revelation this summer in croatia where people from all over the eu go down to to enjoy the great weather and the beautiful beaches . 
  i can only describe briefly the overall experience as this : we are like a huge family , we know and respect each other , have more or less the same values , our conversations are effortless . 
  suddenly a united states of europe did not seem naive or weird at all , on the contrary , it seemed obvious and necessary . 
  `` people going through croatia-slovenia-austria are welcomed with open arms '' http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/09/refugees-stuck-croatia-slovenia-border-150921061001663.html, 
  for hungary the standard of living started to rise after the soviets finally left our country in 1989 and we became independent . 
  a lot of investors came , we had jobs and gdp was increasing . 
  the eu membership did not really influence our standard of living much . 
  i am sorry but you are just flat out stupid in that comment : 1 , please note that i did not say we should let anyone die , ** on the contrary , i said we should rescue people who fall into the ocean ** 2 , if we keep bringing them to ashore then ** it is ** a message that you can just get on a shitty boat anytime and the eu will take care of the rest . 
  i believe this is a very irresponsible message indeed and this is the current situation you are just as mawkishly emotional now as merkel . 
  i also have a feeling that this last `` comment '' was what you wanted to tell anyway and you just got tired of me giving you sensible answers so now finally you gave up by just putting words in my mouth i did n't say and then yell `` ok shut the fuck up '' . 
  you , sir , are fucking pathetic . 
  say he comes back and kills your family with a bomb ? 
  would you still be so understanding and held no grudge ? 
  but was he wrongfully detained ? 
  really ? 
  i did not use it before . 
  just read about it yesterday and was in my mind . 
  i like how everyone either does not get my point or replies with something totally irrelevant crap like this, 
  another one that does not understand a simple point ... 
  they need to get the message that getting on shitty boats and then crying for help - the current modus operandi devised by the asshole people smugglers openly taking advantage of the eus morality - no longer works . 
  if they fall into the ocean our coast guard can rescue but then bring them back to where they came from . 
  the key problem is the number of people coming to the eu . 
  of course we should help people who are genuine refugees but then not just the eu and turkey but the whole world !, 
  saud arabia , quatar ... why are they not helping ? 
  they did n't . 
  the coast guards brought them to ashore . 
  dont do that . 
  do it like australia , give fuel to the boat and turn them back, 
  the wall keeps them out or at least reduces the flow down to a managable size . 
  then we check and register and decide what to do . 
  if they are not eligible for asylum they will be forced to leave the country, 
  merkel does not consider the migrants a problem at all . 
  that is the problem her living in a bubble we had a solution , keep them out . 
  the migrants want go to germany anyway so there is no point asking countries like hungary to accept quotas, 
  this problem was caused by merkel that is why germany has the responsibility to solve it . 
  she invited refugees whilst many other eu contries do n't want them . 
  building a wall is party a solution , at least for the short term . 
  hungary is not a first safe country . 
  the migrants arriving to our borders were all in greece days before . 
  i do n't understand why germans keep saying that and blaming us for not registering them . 
  the fate of the politician depends on whether he gets elected or not . 
  it is in his financial interest to be a `` chameleon '' i.e. 
  change his views to the majority opinion to maximize votes . 
  in a democracy those with firm belief would be eliminated soon by natural selection . 
  however , no one lives in a democracy today . 
  hence the sentimental leader , merkel ... 
  why should they still be in hungary when the first safe eu country they reached was greece ? 
  please tell me . 
  according to doublin regulation greece needs to register them , not hungary . 
  yet merkel demanded first that we register them . 
  later she said we can send them all to germoney . 
  why is greece not criticized at all ? 
  why do you all blame hungary ? 
  by the way , how is it fair that a bankrupt country like greece has to handle all the mass immigration flood that merkel caused ?
