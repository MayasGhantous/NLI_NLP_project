  according to interviewed technical experts , it is possible that most of the objections are significant for the tender legally , but not technically , they are easy to replace , or marginal . 
  we ca n't decide in these questions . 
  ( ... ) as it was reported , the russian metrovagonmash won a huf 69 billion public tender for the renovation of underground trains . 
  the russians finally won as the bkv disqualified the estonian skinest rail . 
  if all goes well , the contract is expected to be concluded by 20 july 2015 . 
  the first trains will arrive 16-18 months later , after the successful tests , two refurbished train will start to work in every month . 
  the budapest city council decided last summer to ask the bkv to held a tender for the renovation of metro line 3 trains . 
  seven companies took part in the tender , but only five of them made it to the second round : alstom , caf spanish , estonian skinest rail , the czech \u0160koda transportation and the subsequent russian winner . 
  alstom then got out of the race , and was soon followed by the caf and \u0160koda , so only two companies remained : the estonian and the russian . 
  rouble would just double the trouble . 
  yeah , sure . 
  never mind , this place is full with toes . 
   greece needs to be sacrificed in order to temper this new blade . 
  is n't greece throw herself on that blade ?

  [ video ] ( https://youtu.be/amdx74dc7wi ) about the soviet invasion of hungary and the siege of budapest . 
  at last i have an opportunity to link a famous essay on the topic ; [ the three historical regions of europe : an outline by jen\u0151 sz\u0171cs and julianna parti ] ( http://www.jstor.org/stable/42555425?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents ) . 
  it 's not wrong . 
  but to tell the truth if i would be ( as a hungarian ) as proud of my national identity as an american , british or french , everyone would consider me a raging nationalist maniac at home . 
  i would say , that in europe it 's okay to be a nationalist if your country fought in the ww1 as an entente power . 
  i do n't like that , but that is how it works . 
  indeed . 
  i kneed to read the link before commenting next time . 
  because he kneed a brake . 
  if i look at those names , i have to admit , that it must be hard for a nationalist czech to find out who is a czech , who is a german and who is a jew on that list . 
  it is indeed interesting and creepy , and i am more than amused , as in hungarian kellner ( kell-ner ) means `` system of national cooperation is needed '' which is a very strong pro-orban political message from a czech . 
  he must be a fan . 
  definitely . 
  he had cca . 
  600 million usd wealth in january , so if the data is correct , that is more than 1000 % growth in six months . 
  i think something is wrong with that list . 
  you know it 's ( the quote ) not really about drugs ? 
  ( at least here , in this thread ) , 
  not a good summer this far . 
  rainy and cold . 
  in other years it 's 35c + around this time , now it 's only around 30c , maybe we will reach 38c next week , but with only 20c during the nights and it looks like it will rain again next week .

  translation : plenty of policemen around , but the refugees can exit the debrecen camp again . 
  despite the apparent calm picture , the passions boil in [ debrecen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/debrecen ) as the city wants to shut down the local reception center , and the local football ultras also sent an ominous message after monday 's riot ( [ yahoo news ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/police-tear-gas-stop-fighting-hungary-refugee-camp-155146950.html ) ) . 
  `` the debrecen refugee camp re-opened , refugees are walking around in the area as if nothing had happened , they drinking coffee at the railway station 's caf\u00e9 . '', 
  - said a local man , who working on the samsoni road to the origo . ( ... ), 
  only the reinforced police presence reminds to the mutiny , the policemen are patrolling the area around the refugee center in group of fours , every ten minutes a police vehicle shows up at the bike path and another always parking at the entrance of the camp ( ... ) the picture is almost idyllic compared to monday , when nearly two hundred refugees raged around here . 
  as origo reported a minor riot broke out here on monday afternoon , after a religious debate between a turk and an afghan refugee . 
  one of them trampled the other 's quran , which led to a fight and more people joined . 
  the refugees broke out from the camp , set the trash cans on fire in front of the entrance and stormed the no. 471 main road armed with sticks and stones and attacked the passing vehicles . 
  the uprising of the refugees eventually cracked down by riot police , who used tear gas , a police officer injured during the clashes . 
  330 police officer and 70 vehicles involved in the action at the refugee camp . 
  after the rebellion a total of six refugees arrested , who were suspected of truculency and vigilantism . ( ... ), 
  the riot can be explained by the crowded station in debrecen : 1500 people live today in the barracks designed to house 830 people . 
  however , the mayor of debrecen is fed up with the problems caused by the refugees . 
  mayor laszlo papp said after the riot , that the city has no place for a refugee camp , the facility should be closed . 
  with this he almost echoed pm orban 's declaration made in brussels on june 26 , in which he also talked about the closure of camps . ( ... ), 
  fidesz mps not left the riot without a word : according to lajos kosa , laszlo posa and laszlo taso all of this is the direct consequence of the fact that more and more people illegally cross the hungarian border . 
  therefore , regardless of what the deputies in the european union think , the refugees would not allowed to leave the camps . 
  lajos kosa otherwise has a safe bet how to distinguish political refugees from the economic immigrant as `` the latter does not come by airplane , albeit he could . '' ( ... ), 
  last week another small riot broke out in [ roszke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%b6szke ) , where the refugees , who waited for their transfers to refugee camps in hangars were demanding freedom , after waiting for a day for buses . 
  a large police force deployed on the scene , but in the end they did not have to take action . 
  a new development is that the hardline football fans mobilized themselves in the subject : the ominous toned article of the ultras liberi warned : `` if the government does not take action against the raging migrants , then the society itself will take and it will have devastating consequences '' . 
  previously , the same facebook page reported that the soccer fans ` patrolling ' the area of m\u00f3rahalom , but have not met with refugees yet . 
  ( ... ) the flow of migrants meanwhile continued on monday , when more than 700 illegal border crossers were apprehended by the police . 
  according to the immigration and naturalization office 60,418 asylum applications were registered since january . 
  reception centers had to be expanded , container houses and tents was set up because of the lack of space . 
  maybe it is , but who are you to tell people what should they believe in ? 
  why do you want to tell them how to live their life ? 
  why do you want to intentionally hurt their feelings ? 
  and my last question this evening : do you think that you can do all of these because you are better than them ?
