  the biggest players of this market made a decent profit and could make their way to the international porn market . 
  ( it 's like toyota with porn . ), 
  livejasmin is also hungarian , so you 're all welcome . 
  ** colonists ? 
  ** transylvania means `` after the forest '' . 
  it 's after the forest if you watch it from hungary . 
  you mean ardeal ? 
  it 's the translation of erd\u00e9ly , and it has only a meaning in hungarian language and it 's territory after the forest . 
  do you know its original romanian name , from the 14th century ? 
  hungarian territories . 
  it 's the same with all geographic names . 
  colonists usually use the names given by the previous population , like the swabians did in hungary , when they used the hungarian names in a swabian way , just like the romanians did it in a romanian way . 
   the gulag archipelago is one of my favourite books than you should be aware , what the better russians think of the communists . 
  putin is not russia or the russians . 
  your opinion about russia is based on current political events and political agendas . 
  russia is more than macho commies marching up and down the street . 
  have you ever heard about solzhenitsyn , pushkin , bulgakov , tolstoy or mussorgsky , tchaikovsky , stravinsky , prokofiev ? 
  your opinion is like when in 1945 everyone denied that germany is european , because everyone forgot goethe , schiller and thousand years of culture because of hitler . 
  no one mentioned , so : thank you sweden , for the music , the songs i 'm singing , thanks for all the joy they 're bringing !, 
  ( and also for the meatballs in the ikea ), 
  the first part was just a joke ( i even know about the chouans ) , but as for the anne de bretagne part til , thank you . 
  what 's that with brittany murphy and austria ? 
  you look bad sui generis , so you 're welcome . 
  that russia in eu thing was mainstream 10 years ago , but they would have twice as much mep as germany , so it will not happen , a special partnership at most . 
  and above all eu is about common values , not just economy . 
  you know , shared common values , like democracy , human rights , avoiding war as a foreign policy tool etc. 
  to apply for a membership , a country needs to show that it 's committed to those values . 
  greatest statesmen like [ move things ] ( http://youtu.be/hdctmpvdo0i ) . 
  [ as for the more active german military role . 
  it depends on the judge 's decision . 
  the judge always designates an earliest possible date for a probation hearing . 
  three guy sentenced to ~ ~ jail ~ ~ prison terms last week , because they killed a homeless man ( for fun ) , the leader can attend to a probation hearing after 40 , the second guy after 30 years . 
  the third one cooperated with the police and the prosecutors , so he did n't get a life sentence , just 20 years ( that means , with a good behaviour , he will be out 7-8 years after his arrest , that means in this case cca .2020 ) . 
  i think these are not extremly harsh sentences , if you consider , what they did . 
  i am not agree with you , but the last thing i would like to do is arguing about what makes a nazi . 
  if someone speaks like a nazi , have nazi friends , attend nazi happenings and read nazi literature , then that person is not a libdem , but a nazi ( or a closeted nazi . ), 
  leo tolstoy 's war and peace , mikhail bulgakov 's the master and margarita , chekhov 's the shooting party , vasily aksyonov 's moskovskaya saga ( its title is moscow story in hungary ) . 
  edit : i forgot sholokhov 's and quiet flows the don . 
  edit2 : also forgot solzhenitsyn 's in the first circle , one of the greatest novels of all time . 
  no , he is not . 
  according to the latest statement ( not by orban , but a close companion ; rogan ) ; he does n't support death sentence , but we need to speak about it . 
  what is most of the people ( at home and abroad ) do n't understand about orban , is that he has no principles . 
  at all . 
  i do n't know why , but he came up with this idea to get some hardcore right voters from jobbik . 
  after the uproar he realized that he would lost more than he win and he try to back out somehow . 
  hungary : the various guards right from the hungarian guard . 
  some of them even make some kind of a military training with airsoft guns and with real rifles which only can fire blanks ( i do n't know the proper name for that . ), 
  most of them has or had some kind , at least personal connections with jobbik . 
  also the jobbik built up a subculture in the past 15 years , it started with the kurucinfo portal ( it based in the us , after many years and many requets by our various governments , its founder is now wanted by the fbi at last ) , which portal like to call the gypsies as orks etc. 
  this guy , ( careful with the opening , he is too handsome ) [ zagyva gy\u00f6rgy gyula ] ( http://hirportal.sikerado.hu/images/kep/201404/zagyvagyorgygyula13.jpg ) was a jobbik mp in the last term , just lost his mandate , because they prepared for a bigger victory . 
  he is one of the connection for these groups , once he closed in two journalist in a room and threatened them with a whip on the magyar sziget ( hungarian island ) festival .

  we also have the [ bety\u00e1rsereg ] ( http://betyarsereg.hu/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/img_7139-2.jpg ) ( host of highwaymen ) , most of them was in prison , that is why they call themselves that name . 
  [ hungarian national frontline ] ( http://jovonk.info/sites/default/files/kepek/hir/2012-04-16-fegyveres-kikepzest-szervez-az-mna-szekszardon.jpg ) on their military training . 
  [ memorial hiking ] ( http://www.jovonk.info/sites/default/files/kepek/2013/01/21-becsulet-napja6.jpg ) , on the day of honour , that was the day , when the germans and the pro-nazi hungarians tried to broke out from the soviet encirclement in 1945 , at the end of the siege of budapest ( cca 500 soldiers made it out of 20000 ) . 
  every year they follow the route , but of course `` they are not nazis , just remembering the heroes ... '' and they are safe as no soviet soldiers spotted in the buda hills in the last decades . 
  edit : also 1 deputy speaker of the national assembly - delegated by the jobbik - is an ex-skinhead , and he was charged back in the 90s because of a racist crime . 
  a leading socialist mp was gave up his party offices - but remained an mp and member of the national security committee - because he was a skinhead back in the 90s . 
  i do n't mind if someone attacking orban , so this is just for the facts : even his own party , the fidesz announced , that they do n't support death penalty under any circumstances , because they are against death penalty as they consider it inhuman and against human dignity . 
  the smaller coalition party , the kdnp ( christian democratic party ) also against it , because all of that and for religious reasons . 
  so despite the fact , that orban had a meeting with every candidate of his party before the elections , and not one candidate got the party support without orban 's personal agreement , orban does n't have support for this in his own party and parliamentary group . 
  this is the correct way , but k\u00f6sz\u00f6nj\u00fck !, 
  happy birthday with a very patriotic [ g\u00f6tterfunken lied ] ( https://youtu.be/vhzhgokux1s ) !, 
  another old joke : accidentaly the us fired a nuclear missile at the soviets , and it hit a major city in the soviet union . 
  casualties : 3 million people . 
  with a major russian city destroyed , it is clear , that a full scale nuclear war is imminent . 
  the us government , in order to save the world , allows the russians to fire one , but only one nuclear missile at the continetal usa . 
  the premier secretary announces the agreement for the soviet political and military leadership , when the commander of the missile forces rises to speak : `` comrade premier secretary , i think we have a problem . 
  we only have those rubber missiles , which we use on the parades . '', 
  `` we have to show strength . 
  fire one anyway ! '', 
  so they fire one rubber missile , and immediately start to write an announcement about how they decided not to kill innocent americans because of their government 's fault . 
  after they finish that , they call up the americans . 
  `` any casualties ? '', 
  `` yeah , 5.6 million so far and it still bouncing ! '', 
  let me guess ; you 're british and you 're deeply convinced that churchill won the war , first at dunkirk , than in africa , italy and normandy . 
  the uk and the us are like the guy who fucked the ugly girl . 
  they liked it very much , but they do n't like to talk about it . 
  it is just a question of a reboot . 
  it became more pro-russian . 
  this title sounds like a summary for a new wolfenstein game . 
  here is the [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_sidney_street ) . 
  sir winston knew what he was talking about , when he said : '' ... we shall fight in the fields and in the streets ... '' , 
  i think it is relevant , as that monument was not vandalized without a reason . 
  this is how it starts . 
  jobbik did not pop out of the box with 20 + percent support in hungary . 
  it started with vandalized cemeteries and monuments ( like the monument of churchill ) and with small demonstrations against liberals , jews , gypsies and gays etc. 
  they built up a cultural hinterland first with actions similar to this . 
  yeah , those damned tourists keep pooping in the pool . 
   this is the real [ illegal logging ] ( http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/226318/latest-tourism-craze-is-called-logging-pooping-in-the-pool/ ) . 
  as for hungary , which is a roman catholic/calvinist/lutheran country , they were replaced by friendly priests , but the replacements were normal priests , just politically cooperated with the system . 
  in the 50s those who did not cooperate were jailed , after 1956 they were blackmailed ( sex , money etc. ), 
  or did n't get a parish . 
  ( i would n't judge those who cooperated , they did not spoke against the regime that 's true , but the main job of a priest is not politics and they remained with their parish and that is the main thing . ), 
  thank you guys , i have never seen a beehive in denial before this . 
  a few hundred in stock and a few dozen in use for practice and training . 
  the government even donated 77 tanks to iraq a few years ago . 
  also there are hundreds of bmps and btrs in stock and of course old migs and who knows what else . 
  i do n't know why they do n't sell them . 
  we should use the language which express everything with only three words : 1 .
