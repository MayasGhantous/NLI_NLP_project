  i know , it is a bold decision , but imagine a debate in the ep in goa'uld . 
  summary : a tank platoon of the hungarian army closed its training with a shooting practice . 
  everybody was very satisfied . 
  `` dude , never blame the pope . '', 
  - catholicism for dummies, 
  adolf , the wolf would love it . 
  of course not the romanian one , because romania is just perfect . 
  jobbik is dangerous , diaconu is not important . 
  my problem is not problem , your problem is great problem . 
  it depends on the political culture , tradition and party system of a country . 
  just look at france before and after 1958 . 
  a change in the electoral system can change everything . 
  with their party system and political culture they had ( i think ) 13 governments between 1947 and 1958 with the `` fair '' system . 
  the mixed hungarian system before 2010 was a good one , as it always created a majority for the future government and it was n't too unfair for smaller parties . 
  ( of course fidesz changed that and redrew the maps of the constituencies , but after they lost one third of their voters in the past months they want to rewrite the rules again . 
  edit : fidesz got less votes in 2014 than in 2006 . 
  in 2006 they lost , in 2014 they won a supermajority . ), 
  i think it is not the best tactic to look away . 
  it did n't work in hungary . 
  just look at the diaconu guy 's logo dracula + moldavia , it rocks . 
  anyway , romanians of the r/europe , why are you hiding such a great blogpost and such a great man from us ? 
  where is that sub ? 
  edit : i put a sub on the video for non hungarians , i am sure it 's not the best , but at least they understand it . 
  google translate : draft law on returning the name of `` gypsy '' roma people we launched the public debate the bill on returning to the official name of `` gypsy '' persons entitled `` roma '' . 
  i am aware that this project will bear much controversy , but we must consider the way the romanians abroad have suffered from confusion between roma and romanian . 
  i received thousands of requests to end this confusion that affected us terribly in recent years . 
  draft law on returning to the official name of `` gypsy '' persons entitled `` roma '' romanian parliament adopts this law : the official name of the roma in romania returns to the ethnic name `` gypsy '' . 
  roma officially is called `` gypsies '' . 
  the names `` gypsy '' `` gypsy '' and their derivatives are used in a pejorative sense . 
  all documents and official names in romania use the name `` gypsy '' `` gypsy '' and their derivatives instead of `` rum '' , `` roma '' , `` romans '' and their derivatives . 
  reason the draft law on returning to the official name of `` gypsy '' entitled persons roma envisages restoring fairness that name and avoid the confusion that occurs abroad between romanian and the name `` rum '' . 
  this confusion has brought a lot of damage to the image of romania and romanians , the latest case in point is insulting documentary `` the australians are coming '' british channel 4 broadcast channel and was watched by millions of britons . 
  this documentary was based precisely on confusion between roma and romanian , its title being romanians coming to britain , but the material focusing on the behavior and life of gypsies in britain . 
  the documentary mentioned above is just one example of how the confusion between roma and romanian was exploited by the western media to denigrate the image of romania and transform the romanians living outside the country in a category rejected by society , accused of various things unreal situation faced by many romanian i want to work not only in european countries but also when they go there for tourism . 
  due to official acceptance of the designation of rum , romania changed and the international abbreviation which was `` rom '' and took the `` rou '' to avoid confusion . 
  it is an international first for a state to abbreviate the name change granted to a minority because a name similar to his . 
  the term `` gypsy '' and `` gypsy '' proposed law is not used in a pejorative sense , it is also used widely in other european languages , as well as the name of `` gypsy '' , the word `` roma '' is a recent invention : gypsy in english , spanish gitano , gitans or tsiganes in french , cig\u00e1ny in hungarian , ciganos portuguese , german and dutch zigeuner , zingari italian , czech cikany , cigana cigana or slavic languages . 
  for a long time , the european council use the term `` gypsies '' and not `` roma '' officially , since 1969 , the date on which an official ec document made reference to this ethnic group . 
  through this bill , the official name of the roma or roma in romania returns to the ethnic name `` gypsy '' and roma will be formally styled `` gypsy '' . 
  also , all documents and official names in romania will use the name `` gypsy '' `` gypsy '' and their derivatives instead of `` rum '' , `` roma '' , `` romans '' and their derivatives . 
  name of rum / roma was assumed by the romanian state through a memorandum foreign minister petre roman in 2000 ( nr . 
  d2 / 1094 of 29/02/2000 ) and is a major mistake . 
  from the text of the memorandum is seen as the romanian state was willing to accept this name though directly contrary to its interests and would give rise to confusion dramatic for romanians living abroad . 
  this bill aims to remedy this confusion and bring things to their natural path . 
  well , you are not so haiku-people , right ? 
  that 's the end of the world as we know it . 
  [ hungary ] ( https://youtu.be/grfjxxzu83k ), 
  it 's okay , white men prefer football ( the real and not the eggball one ) to anti-racism event . 
  in case of hippie event emergency f1 is also okay . 
  even watching a 5 year old record of a poker tournament is better than that . 
  other than raz , dwa , tree , chitere , pyjat , w\u00fcsel zaychick pabulyat ? 
   edit : i also know , that rascvetaly jablony i grusy , paplyly tumany nad rekoy ; weehogjeela na bereg kathusa , na vizokiy bereg , na krutoy . 
  please note , that you should n't use ` szivi ' for ` sz\u00edvesen ' as it sounds weird if you are not a 16 years old girl . 
  it 's that number on the right side of your nick which grows if you write rasputin , prezputin or putler and goes down when you ask where is the ukrainian army . 
  sure it 's the worst job in the world . 
  give him a job at a cocoa plantation in ivory coast , or in a diamond mine in sierra leone . 
  i am sure there are cca .100 qualified diplomats in the western world who would gladly take that job at any time . 
   i believe any party that would have got 2/3 majority would have been bad . 
  having 2/3 of the power is dangerous in any country , even more so in a newer democracy . 
  horn and mszp-szdsz had a 2/3 majority between 1994 and 1998 and did n't do such things . 
  gyurcs\u00e1ny is a fucking idiot , but i do think that mszp was better . 
  with bajnai as pm and oszko as fm and without the unorthodox matolcsy madness this whole economic shit what we have would be solved by now . 
  when did the mszp do such things as the fidesz , with the constitution and everything in this country ? 
  edit : just look at the [ fuckner.hu ] ( http://fuckner.hu/ ) if you forgot what fidesz did to hungary . 
  it 's a 53 pages long study in pdf . 
  it 's not colorblindness , everyone was aware that the victims were killed because of their ethnicity . 
  the media and the public opinion was on the side of the victims just like in the cozma or olaszliszka case . 
  of course we have racist and extremists , but i think we are quite united as a nation , for example police brutality against poor white people is far more possible than against a well situated roma . 
  edit : the main problem of the romas in hungary is poverty . 
  contrary to what the link says the roma murders were also covered by the media in hungary and also shocked the country . 
  when those extremists started to hunt down the gypsies , they tried to start some kind of a `` racial war '' . 
  they failed . 
  you know we are one nation and it is not a 2 hungarian and 6 roma , it 's 8 hungarian and i do n't like your comment as it implies the 2 vs. 6 scenario . 
  you know the marian cozma murder was a totally another pair of shoes . 
  it was a shock . 
  that murder and the olaszliszka lynching were the turning points for the hungarian far-right and for the jobbik . 
  there was a nationwide uproar against the gypsies . 
  just see the [ photos ] ( http://galeria.index.hu/belfold/2009/02/15/emlekmenet_marian_cozma_tiszte/ ) of the memorial march for marian cozma in veszprem . 
  to be true , some of our laws or the police and the prosecutors , i do n't know which , are not the best . 
  murderers and rapers often get just a few years in prison , while the guy who poisoned his own wine , stored in his own barrel , in his own basement is prosecuted for murder , because the burglar drank from it . 
  a 22 years old guy from a normal family . 
  his parents are shocked as he was a good kid , never made trouble . 
  he was unemployed , made some money with babysitting . 
  he wanted to start his own life from the robbed money . 
  he realized that the young women could call the police after he left , so he killed her ( stabbed her five times with a foot long kitchen knife ) to prevent that , after that switched off the lights in the shop and closed the door . 
  the police found him on the street surveillance system 's footage , he lurked around the local tobacco shops all day to find one where the cashier is alone . 
  edit : he killed that girl for cca .100 euros . 
  i did n't say that , just mentioned a few , but some people just ca n't handle that . 
  [ archer ] ( https://youtu.be/2wbsgvytas8 ), 
  looks like it is , as in hungary for civil use it is [ optional ] ( http://www.corrad.hu/uploads/nemzetek_zaszloi/magyar%20z%c3%a1szl%c3%b3%20nemzeti%20z%c3%a1szl%c3%b3.gif ) to put our coat of arms on the flag with two crosses ( one on the holy crown and a double cross ) and we have the same on our [ military flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/war_flag_of_hungary.svg/2000px-war_flag_of_hungary.svg.png ) . 
  so that is at least two but almost three crosses on a flag and it 's not enough ? 
  nothing can beat the swedish charm . 
  it was my understanding that germany is the alabama of europe , but now i am confused . 
  the rabbit screaming in the bushes : - help !, 
  help !, 
  the bear wants to rape me !, 
  - it 's teddy , it 's teddy ... 
  well , that is revealing . 
  nitpicker . 
  and you wrote that on a computer , invented by a hungarian .
