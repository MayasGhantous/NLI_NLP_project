  you should write it down in ms office , developed by a hungarian , or send me a letter written by a ballpoint pen aka biro , invented by a hungarian . 
  but i finished this , before you send in the u.s. cavalry , founded by a hungarian or drop an h-bomb on me , also invented by a hungarian ... , 
  omg . 
  it 's a historical moment . 
  a romanian admitted that romania got something from hungary . 
   all hail our eternal friendship !, 
  shameless plug . 
  [ one ] ( https://youtu.be/baozxphv0vc ) for hungary . 
  nice video about [ northern hungary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcfj6v9eg-i ) . 
  wide selection of recreational possibilities for tired eurocrats . 
  as a sportsman i have to say it 's a pity that bureaucracy spoiled this tradition . 
  i remember we had splendid basque seasons in the recent years in iceland , all of them was rather healthy and generally in a good shape . 
  i hope the basque population wo n't grow too large and decline in quality without hunting in iceland . 
  i just realized that you should build this new eurocoruscant in [ n\u00f3gr\u00e1d ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/n%c3%b3gr%c3%a1d_county ) or in [ baz ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/borsod-aba%c3%baj-zempl%c3%a9n_county ) county , in hungary . 
  they have castles , nice villages , roads and railways and a collapsed heavy industry , it is almost like a hyper-wallonia in the east . 
  a great eu investment would be most welcomed there , so send us that danish mayor and city council . 
  '' - now then , soldier , are you looking forward to giving those frenchies a damn good licking ? 
  - er , no , sir -- it 's the germans we shall be licking , sir . 
  - do n't be revolting , darling !, 
  i would n't lick a german if he was glazed in honey ! '', 
  the traditional hungarian [ way ] ( http://www.recepttar.hu/recept-img/6000/6759_boros_vaddisznoporkolt_gombaval.jpg ) to deal with poor boars : wild boar goulash ( what else ? ), 
  with mushrooms and red wine . 
  eat them !, 
  just some condominias : egypt from 1876 to 1882 was an anglo-french condominium , anglo-egyptian sudan from 1899 to 1956 ; or in europe : condominium of bosnia and herzegovina was an austro-hungarian condominium from 1908 to 1918 . 
  all were highly successful . 
   as a u.s. citizen i would like to see us completely pull out of europe . 
  as a collection of countries your gdp surpasses the u.s. and yet your defense spending is extremely poor . 
  i feel that we are subsidizing your defense with very little benefit to our own economy . 
  you should think it over again . 
  as a leading global power ( not leading in all aspects , but in most of the aspects ) the usa benefits from nato . 
  of course , if you are ready to give up the global leadership you can withdraw , but the cause of the oversized u.s. military budget is not the nato . 
  anyway i support a stronger nato ( it would be enough if everyone would spend the promised budgets on military ) , but not without the usa . 
  this alliance and its mission is worth to keep . 
   do european leaders want to turn the world 's happiest and richest continent into detroit ? 
  yes , that is their goal . 
  they want to lure more americans into europe .

  ### hungary `` hungary was very lucky , because despite the fact that the usual winds would cover the country with a radiation cloud , the actual wind took it to western europe '' - said sandor pellet , deputy director of the radiobiology and radiation health research institute of hungary in 2011 , on the 25th anniversary . 
  because of this in hungary no special protective measures were taken . 
  the soviet leadership tried to hide the disaster , but after sweden warned about the radioactive clouds , it was impossible to conceal the accident for a long time . 
  part of hungary first heard about the accident from the austrian and yugoslavian tvs . 
  on the morning after the disaster , after saw the pollution in the collected data , some employees of the central research institute for physics , budapest called several kindergartens and nurseries across the country on street payphone , to alert teachers to `` a strong solar radiation that can be harmful to children . '', 
  from the kindergartens the warning spread throughout the country . 
  on april 28 ivan bedo , chief editor of the hungarian radio 's news announced the disaster , after he heard it from the bbc radio news . 
  the higher authorities stopped the transmission and bedo received a penalty . 
  due to a travel ban introduced in several european countries for soviet vehicles , hungarian truckers transported the goods from the soviet union to europe , mainly through kiev . 
  many of them received most significant radiation dose during the trip , many of them died within a few years . 
  however , the reasons did not show a clear correlation with the radiation . 
  it is undeniable that the truck drivers died remarkably early , but officially not because of the radiation . 
  that means broadband over power line in oradea in a few years . 
  wow . 
  is n't that because of zoltan teszari 's rcs & rds ( aka digi ) ? 
  in hungary the real drop in prices and increase in speed started , when digi first attacked upc and t-com . 
  that is because ~ ~ the ~ ~ zoltan teszari 's rcs & rds ( aka digi ) does n't attack upc and t-com in western europe . 
  according to my highly educated google search ( and i am a russian expert , as i saw russian people several times ) : vladimir : russian speakers understood and understand the meaning as `` world ruler '' , putin : `` someone who goes along the way '' . 
  wow . 
  creepy . 
  orban 's and his party 's popularity has been steadily declining and hungarians afraid of immigration as much , that in 2006 , 68 % of them disfavoured the immigration of the non-existing [ pir\u00e9z people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pir%c3%a9z_people ) . 
  really badass anthem . 
  yeah , export in comecon was about bartering . 
  there was a joke about that : there is a governmental audit at the last checkpoint on the soviet-hungarian border . 
  the inspector is pleased with the accounts and he calls for the local customs officer : - comrade , i am very pleased to see that our economic connections with the glorious soviet union are flourishing and improving day by day on the basis of mutual advantages . 
  - yes , they are , comrade . 
  - i see we exported 100 wagons of grain , 50 wagons of meat and 50 wagons of iron ore only in the last week . 
  - it is impressive , comrade . 
  - i see that the soviets sent us exactly 200 hundred wagons of seshit in return , comrade . 
  - they did , comrade . 
  first grade seshit . 
  - what is `` seshit '' ? 
  agree with that . 
  i did n't mean some pure christianity as there are fathers and doctors of the church , christian traditions , councils and 2000 years of evolution . 
  but christianity is there in our european character , in our way of thinking about the world and society and sometimes about science ( for example i do n't think that supporting stem cell research or cloning of servants would be an ethical problem for an ancient roman ) . 
  and i am guess you are a proud neo-pagan and this is a religious question for you . 
  now , release your anger . 
  the roman empire did not fall because of the christianity . 
   the ottomans were n't the successors , but more the morticians of the remains of the east roman empire . 
  mehmed ii claimed the title kaysar-i-r\u00fbm `` emperor of rome '' and proclaimed himself the protector of the orthodox church . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman_dynasty#titles ), 
   if our religion was christianity ... should we send in the monks and jesuits ? 
   just joking , half of hungary is a muhtesem y\u00fczyil fan , so apparently we like ottomans . 
  they are , but i do n't know a better name for that than christianity and we should not fear to use that name . 
  imagine european culture without investiture contest , christian schisms and reformation . 
  even what is survived from the classical literature is almost entirely preserved by christian monks . 
  but this is very off topic . 
  maybe , i do n't know their triggers . 
  i was n't there , but vladivostok is a european city , while beijing or tokyo is not . 
  that is true but that is the best name for it , the `` asian cult founded by jesus '' is not catchy . 
  without that foundation there would n't be renaissance and enlightenment etc. 
  again , i am not a religious guy , but ancient greek and roman or jewish ethics are different from ours . 
   they have many ural-altaic minorities ... oh , no , they are quickly assimilating the uralic people . 
  a few years ago a hungarian guy got beaten up in izhevsk in a bus stop , because he spoke with a friend in hungarian and the local russians thought he spoke udmurt ( and the `` why do n't you speak russian ... '' started ) . 
  ( edit : grammar ), 
  every time i said here that european civilization is essentially christian , i was always handled as a religious maniac . 
  but christian ethics and values is the real foundation of our culture and society , not the pure , ancient greek and roman values . 
  true . 
  but i am just the messenger here . 
   it worth a discussion , albeit the site/group itself looks pro-russian to me , so maybe it 's just an attempt to show that the real enemy of europe is the is and not russia in ukraine . 
  about [ habony ] ( http://hungarianspectrum.org/2013/03/04/orbans-chief-adviser-arpad-habony-and-his-encounter-with-the-law/ ) about [ vajna ] ( http://budapestbeacon.com/politics/rambo-producer-andy-vajna-strikes-gold-in-hungary-the-old-fashioned-way/ ), 
   only france would be brave enough brave . 
  only hungary was brave enough to mantain its diplomatic presence and waving the eu flag in tripoli under the intervention and to mantain a diplomacy link between the opposing forces .
