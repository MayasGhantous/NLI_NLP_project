  economic loss for hungarian companies involved in libyan projects . 
  well , that guy travelled there as a `` part of a media tour group organized by europa objektiv , an initiative of citizens in russia and germany working to provide information about the war in eastern ukraine to writers and journalists '' , so what should one expect ? 
  but the article itself shows what the russians try to show about the war and about donetsk , that is why i found it interesting . 
  i could n't be more specific about the qualities of the journalist in the headline as i do n't want to push my opinion . 
  french are natural born predators . 
  they catch their own . 
  it is sometimes very challenging in downtown paris . 
  google translation of the main part ( after the author dismissed all arguments against the military intervention ) : `` these arguments , to discourage european military action in libya , do not hold . 
  militarily , the cost would be negligible , given the consequences , even in europe , with a non-intervention . 
  libya is a big step , but mostly desert , with easy to control . 
  it is also populated by only 6 million people , fewer than the neighboring tunisia . 
  many of these libyans , moreover , would look favorably european intervention . 
  they would be far from supporting daesh ( edit : isis ) , they measure more excesses . 
  finally , militarily , france has recently shown that in mali several thousand men well trained , supported where necessary by aviation can achieve substantial results . 
  it is only necessary to ensure that they remain sustainable , maintaining sufficient presence in the field . 
  regarding the political opposition that could create a european intervention in libya , it is obvious that it should be part of an african intervention . 
  that should be conducted jointly with the countries named above , egypt , algeria , tunis , or niger , chad and mali . 
  impossible task you would say to reach a consensus amongst them . 
  ( ... ) as finally to avoid the action to be exploited by us interventions or by those states or various oil interests , it is sufficient that the europeans will watch that this does not happen . 
  the real difficulty is within europe ( ... ) is that the european union becomes autonomous power capable of being taken seriously by the rest of the world . '', 
  who knows ? 
  i think it is not yet . 
  lazar lied again ( or almost did ) . 
  is should n't kill christians . 
  the mainly christian europe should n't watch the persecution of the christians in the is territory and in the islamic world with such calm stoicism . 
  they want to destroy our way of life , that is the problem . 
  i ca n't pretend that throwing out an is guy is a heroic deed . 
  it is the minimum from a community which allegedly share our common european values about liberty and freedom . 
  is it not obvious ? 
  edit : it seems it is not . 
  should i be proud of them for this ? 
  i hope the is guy did n't harmed in the process . 
  that would n't be humanitarian and european and pc .

  football ( because that is the name of it ) is the most popular sport in the world and not without a reason . 
  that is just fine . 
  he was thrown out , while the christians on is territory were beheaded . 
  how do you know that he is not the master ? 
  shame on me , but i agree with putin on this . 
  ( but the stalingrad veteran broke the charm for me . ), 
  thanks , til . 
  great country . 
  sorry for my ignorance , but easter was april 5 for the good catholics and april 12 for the not so good catholics .

  yes , a long time ago . 
  he wrote his first book in the subject back in the 90s , if i remember well . 
  nothing , mr. jordan belfortosenko . 
  you implied i have to be a nuclear or i do n't know what expert to prove that the ukrainian stock market is small ? 
  you 're a natural born entertainer . 
  edit : excuse me , i did n't know that you are the ukrainian gordon geckovich . 
  of course he is after the money . 
  everyone is , only soros is more successful than the most of us . 
  '' ... you essentially robbed ... '' from the workers and peasants ? 
  he warned about the risks of the market fundamentalism . 
  i did n't say he predicted anything . 
  it 's hungarian , but us and french companies wanted to get the contract , i have never heard of the romanians . 
  but i do n't see the connection between this and the ukrainian stock exchange . 
  what ? 
  stock climb on the ukrainian stock market ? 
  you do n't know the numbers . 
  that rich guy emigrated from hungary without a penny after the communists took over the government in 1948 . 
  he has supported the democratic movements in eastern europe since the 1980s . 
  also that rich guy warned about the risks in the global financial system years before 2008 . 
  they did , but only after they realized that the other option was a nuclear war . 
  i think they will definitely try something in venezuela , argentina or bolivia . 
  they already sold weapons to them , if i remember well . 
  which soviets ? 
  berlin blockade/1956/cuba / 1968/afghanistan soviets or kitchen debate/helsinki nice guy soviets ? 
  they always changed their behavior just like putin . 
  yep . 
  that 's the best in a cold war ; double standards . 
  in the news in hungary ( not state tv of course ) they already called obama the leader of the free world a few days ago , what is true , but i have n't heard it for a while . 
  nice try . 
  and from where and how and why come this ? 
  putin behaves like the ussr , so i am sure he will do something like that eventually . 
  wait until the arrival of russian trainers to cuba and venezuela . 
  well , after all those questions about jobbik , as a hungarian i have to ask that is france really that racist ? 
  why the french people are so racist ? 
  why they hate the romani people so much ? 
  is it safe for a roma to live in france ? 
  i did n't mean you , i do n't want to offend macedonians or greeks that 's why i started with noi . 
  no offense intended but i do n't care . 
  edit : this downvoting is funny as really guys , most of europe do n't even know where is macedonia , and this naming dispute is really not interesting outside those two countries . 
  macedonia and greece have better things to do by the way , i suppose .
