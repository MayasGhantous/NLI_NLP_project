  you will liberate the shit out of them , right ? 
  about bad distraction : in the real life you have to deal with situations when they are at hand and not when it is ideal . 
  the current policies of the ukrainian government are bad . 
  they want to escalate the conflict ( statues , moldavia etc. ), 
  and they want to force the nato into a position where it have to help them . 
  they want us to win the war for them . 
  this is not how things work . 
  first you have to stand up for yourself . 
  just remember the serbs and croats . 
  or just leave them as they were until they solved the current situation . 
  if the goverment behave like this it shows only one thing : they gave up the reunification and they just want to clean up the table before the final partition of ukraine . 
  i meant mozart , but true . 
  that is plain stupidity . 
  the russian media will begin an offensive just they did after maidan and the pro-russian locals will be radicalized by this act . 
  few months and kharkiv will become kharkov . 
  they should ask the locals before they do such thing in the current situation . 
  then kolkhoz is the employee owned one , but it is almost the same . 
  edit : how is that your ancestors did n't live in villages ? 
  everyone has his own farm ? 
  kolkhoz is basically a state owned farm where the farmers are employees like in a factory and they had plan numbers to fulfill and such . 
  you can move your toes and they wo n't freeze as easily as in a tight one . 
  it is not that bad . 
  an old guy who survived the pow camps after the destruction of the hungarian 2nd army at the don in 1943 ( cca . 
  6000 guys came home out of 120000 casualties ) , gave me a few hints in 2003 about how to survive there . 
  first quit smoking in time , so you can trade cigs for bread . 
  have few size bigger boots than you need and it helps if you are willing to eat human meat sometimes . 
  ( by the way he survived because he joined the soviets , became a partisan and finished the war in austria . ), 
  that 's a good solution . 
  shit . 
  my disguise has been compromised . 
  source ? 
  i saw farage only in ep ( luckily on tv ) , but based on that experience it would better to leave it to the swords . 
  that man is in love with his own voice . 
  animosity ? 
  prussians really loved a certain austrian . 
  it 's not about communism , after the 1960s the agriculture in hungary flourished . 
  the real problem in those villages started after 1990 , when we lost the eastern markets for the low quality products and we needed capital for the modernization . 
  we still have our industry built back then , only with new owners . 
  apart from this , i agree with you . 
  we have covered almost everything , we only need a habsburg to start the process . 
  all right , but only if we build our new compromise around the pottery barn rule . 
  they always shoot them . 
  it is not easy to find a new one every time . 
  the b is much closer to the proper form , which is hawsburrgg . 
  but just call them emperor or archduke if you find some , they usually like that . 
  who talked about forcing ? 
  nothing could stop the accession of croatia after austria and hungary were inside . 
  we need your help to bring back the habsburgs . 
  poland joined nato in 1999 and worked hard to achieve those goals what you mentioned . 
  do n't grab russia into this . 
   simply impractical in this century that is a good point , just not good to hear . 
  because of the built in infrastructure and buildings . 
  it will be a bit tight . 
  life in a hungarian village is very city-like . 
  in most places you have every services , even cable tv and internet , if any tradition remained there , then that is only for tourists or the tradition of drinking in the local bar ( and of course `` pig-killing '' ) . 
  i am not crying for some kind of a traditionalist ancient village life , just do n't like wasting resources . 
  it seems like a waste to let complete villages with buildings and infrastructure to vanish . 
  i would be very upset after it took my country more than 10 years to join these organisations and hungary started reforming its socialist system not in 1990 , but in 1968 . 
  we worked hard to achieve these goals ( eu and nato ) and our society paid a great price in the transition . 
  we fought against ussr in 1956 , and we were always pushing the limits of the socialism until 1989 . 
  we became imf and world bank members in the 80s ( against the will of moscow ) , oecd members in 1996 , our goverment had a key role in the liquidation of warsaw pact and we did not get access for a hov lane in return . 
  hungary always supported the enlargement of the eu , but it would be a sheer madness to let ukraine join in its current shape , just because of an anti-russian hysteria . 
  yep , it is misleading . 
  sorry about that . 
  i was thinking about the whole effort when i made the title and i screwed that up . 
  but at least we have a chance to speak about fusion energy here . 
  edit : but the title is still true ... , 
  i like it , just send me yours if you fed up with it . 
  european fed . 
  yes . 
  15 minutes . 
  was it worth it ? 
  yeah , apparently you were communists back then . 
  they are always coming back . 
  but putting horthy in power was not a great choice . 
  but what a legend . 
  edit : we have legends about corsets and makeups either . 
   became a big country , briefly occupied budapest when you , romanians spoke about this , you always forgot to mention what happened when you attacked the monarchy in the third year of the war and where you started the year 1918 ( [ armistice of focsani ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armistice_of_foc%c8%99ani ) and [ treaty of bucharest ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_bucharest_ ( 1918 ) ) . 
  you occupied budapest because the monarchy lost on the italian front and against [ louis franchet d'esp\u00e8rey ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/louis_franchet_d%27esp%c3%a8rey#salonika ) and everybody just wanted to end that war in hungary . 
  you only defeated the weak and isolated soviet republic , but only after a shameful diplomacy trick . 
  also do n't forget the great american officer , mg harry hill bandholtz who prevented the brave romanian soldiers from looting the hungarian national museum on 5 october 1919 with a [ stick ] ( http://hungary.usembassy.gov/statue_of_bandholtz.html ) . 
  you are the one who is confused . 
  very confused . 
  edit : you should read this [ article ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2077493/it-simply-inconceivable-argentina-falklands.html ), 
   britain is n't the military power it was anymore . 
  just like you now , back in 1981 argentines calculated that the uk would never respond militarily to an invasion and it is unwilling and unable to defend its territories and subjects in the falklands . 
  look what happened . 
  let me answer your question with the hit of the beatrice from 1976 : [ 20th century ] ( https://youtu.be/hnm_0rhrc08 ) the guy who sings is fero nagy , `` the cockroach of the nation '' , great guy . 
  `` i am hungarian , born to be a hungarian , traitors and villains ruled over me where did the wind blow sixteen million ? 
  i hate the whole twentieth century !,
