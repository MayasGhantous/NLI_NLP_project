  the [ personal mottos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz_joseph_i_of_austria#personal_motto ) of franz joseph . 
  viribus unitis = with united forces ( as austrian emperor ) virtutis confido = my trust in the ancient virtue ( as king of hungary ), 
  `` please , please !, 
  this is supposed to be a happy occasion !, 
  let 's not bicker and argue about who killed who ... '', 
  that is very useful . 
  most of the communists will reconsider their political stance now , just like the nazis and communist did elsewhere in europe where similar bans implemented . 
  no need to build up a military and national defense as such brilliant legislative work will defend ukraine itself . 
  if you speak hungarian , then you should check this [ blog ] ( http://politicalradical.cafeblog.hu/ ) which made by the political capital 's staff with interesting posts about the jobbik . 
  they wrote an article about [ asotthalom ] ( http://politicalradical.cafeblog.hu/cimke/szelsojobb/ ) and their conclusion is that the swing you mentioned does not exist and the left lost voters because of their lack of solutions for real problems . 
  in my pov fidesz supports jobbik and lmp with his communication in order to create a convenient opposition , like putin did in russia . 
  if mszp would be destroyed than there wo n't be any real competition for them as the jobbik always could be labelled as a dangerous extremist party and lmp is too intellectual and i do n't have better word , `` jewish '' for the mainstream hungarian voter . 
  moreover jobbik or lmp would join the fidesz in a coalition , while mszp , dk or egyutt would not , which is a pity , i would love to see gyurcsany and orban in the same cabinet , they would kill each other in no time . 
  see , i know everything about germany . 
  the business part of the discussion was ended for me at the lesser evil and russians are euroasians statements , however i still say that no business like oil business , but i gave up the discussion because of that rampage . 
  you wo n't like it , but here is the `` i am a roma , a criminal according to many , i trust you , hug me if you trust me . '', 
  video made on the calvin square by roland bango . 
  we still have solidarity in our country . 
  a hidden camera video [ footage ] ( https://youtu.be/yzki6ffowdc ), 
  cnp ( cuckfield national party ) will deal with that . 
  that is true . 
  i would just add that sometimes the fidesz speaks like kadar did , so it is not hard for a socialist voter to feel at home there . 
  omg , man . 
  it is pretty much similar to what a western european right extremist would say only you need to change gypsies to muslims . 
  you hit it outta the park with this rampage but do n't try to sell this shit to me , find someone from outside hungary . 
  something something something oktoberfest . 
  something something something complete . 
   for which they didnt apologize yet ( 1954 hungary . 
  hungary ** 1956 ** . 
  watch my flag dude . 
  and they did apologize . 
  yeltsin did it twenty years ago . 
  edit : european civilization has christian roots . 
  that is a fact . 
  the socialists lost support in the north eastern part of the country after 2006 and the jobbik gained much support there , but this support is because of the gypsies and the jobbik 's racism . 
  the socialist lost the middle after 2006 , but the middle went to the fidesz , not to the jobbik ( and many of the former socialist voters just finished with politics ) . 
  i think the jobbik found new voters and voters from the fidesz , not former socialist voters as the distance is too big on the ideological spectrum . 
  the lmp and fidesz always states that the jobbik has a plenty of former socialist voters but they do n't have anything to prove that , it is just the part of their communication to place themselves in the middle . 
  i know former socialist voters who supported the fidesz in 2014 only because of the tax system , so based on my experience i think a former socialist would vote sooner for the fidesz than for the jobbik . 
  i will try to find sources for proving my pov , but i ca n't promise anything . 
  well , ponta is a socialist , maybe the main goals are still the same . 
  i think because of the current political hysteria you mix up people and goverments and short time and long time political goals . 
  russia is european and christian from kaliningrad to vladivostok while iran is not . 
  we have common cultural heritage with russia . 
  iran is a theocratical muslim state which sponsors terrorism . 
  the goverments of quatar and saudi arabia does not support terrorism , moreover the arab league fights iranian sponsored terrorists in yemen in these days . 
  see , they have just found the oil and i have already offended the proud people of west sussex with my ignorance . 
  that was my [ source ] ( https://www.georgewbushlibrary.smu.edu/ ) for the data and they have plenty of similar cutting edge analyses . 
  true , that is why i wrote ` pilot onboard ' . 
  wow , man . 
  you really love your grammar . 
  between belgium and spain and west from switzerland . 
  i talked about supply and demand not about what need to be . 
  you wo n't be happy when the west sussexian indigenous people ( like the proud [ people of cuckfield ] ( http://www.midsussextimes.co.uk/webimage/1.6432551.1416585296!/image/764952908.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/764952908.jpg ) ) will lose their cultural heritage and [ sacred cultural sites ] ( http://thebarleymowpub.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/riva-slider-pro/timthumb.php?src=http://thebarleymowpub.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/the-barley-mow-the-bar.jpg&amp;h=322&amp;w=617&amp;zc=1 ) because of the oil industry . 
  still iran has a pretty bad record regarding human rights and terrorism . 
  but no business like oil business . 
  there were plenty of links here on the r/europe in the last year . 
  like the [ report ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2z43p4/hungarian_veterans_of_the_ukrainian_armys_128th/ ) with the hungarian guys from the mukacheve ~ ~ battalion ~ ~ ( edit : brigade ) or the the video where separatists [ paraded ] ( http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/08/24/ukraine-crisis-idinkbn0go0hj20140824 ) pows in donetsk . 
  it was quite obvious what happened to those pows after the parade . 
  do you still consider drone attacks war crime if there would be a pilot onboard ? 
  drone warfare is still aerial warfare only without a pilot . 
  i would n't trust iran either . 
  do n't you remember the protests only three years ago ? 
  i do n't think that a theocratic dictatorship is better than russia , which is still a european country and causes no trouble under normal management . 
  it is popular to be anti-russian in europe and anti-european in russia but europe needs gas and russia needs to sell it . 
  killing down a good business because of short sighted political goals is plain stupidity . 
  edit : i deleted the `` russian '' attribute from `` russian gas '' , because of the pressure from the grammar lobby . 
  nice article , but i would be more than happy if i see a single article about the destruction of hortobagy national park ( an unesco world heritage site ) in the international media . 
  yeah in h'zeus . 
  only big parties have a chance to implement their ideas in reality . 
  what is ideal is one thing and an other is what we have , that is why i think that if there is a chance on the left , then that is the mszp . 
  jobbik voters are not former socialists that was showed by the polls a few times . 
  about reinvent itself : maybe they just stop reinventing themselves all the time and just win the election if they can . 
  anyway you ca n't show an other hungarian party which changed its leadership as many times as the socialists . 
  it is not 95 . 
  you forget that mszp won the elections after 1990 three times . 
  also every time it lost it changed its leaders on every level . 
  the mszp has a chance to win an election in the future , while lmp has not . 
  it 's a metropolitan new left party for intellectuals and will remain that and most of the voters think they are just creatures of the fidesz . 
  do n't think just drink it . 
  fidesz is full with former communists . 
  they like the way how fidesz works . 
  mszp is the heir of the lefty tradition and it is clearly showed by the constant attacks of the right . 
  there is good and bad imperialism . 
  bad imperialist powers are : spain , portugal , germany , japan , austria-hungary , russia and italy . 
  good imperialist powers are : uk , france , the netherlands , belgium . 
  tintin and quatermain good , hans gruber bad . 
  he can tell a lie with a question . 
   our socialist party is still the official continuation ... mszp is 147 years old , communism was 45 years from it . 
  shame , shame but at least it 's not cloaked . 
  vote for fidesz if you prefer cloaking of communists . 
  we just call him c ronaldo in hungary and we also know figo and soon everyone else will . 
  it 's similar , but without basil and garlic . 
  the mainstream lecso starts with melting some paprika powder in oil and this makes lecso much more like a vegetable goulash , but every family has his own recipe . 
  the typical is to have 15 % onion , 25 % tomato and 60 % paprika in your lecso but someone put zucchini and such in the dish also . 
  eat cake for god 's sake !, 
  peasants !, 
  i think the basics are the same everywhere in europe , in hungary the real addition to the basics is the [ fozelek ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/f%c5%91zel%c3%a9k ) , a vegetable stew . 
  every hungarian kid hates [ squash-fozelek ] ( http://m.cdn.blog.hu/mi/mitegyek/image/etelfotok/tokfozelekfasirttal2.jpg ) or [ green peas fozelek ] ( http://erdely.ma/ujkepek/2014/06/nagy/1403493412_5561.jpg ) but fozelek is the backbone of the everyday hungarian cuisine . 
  my personal nightmare is the [ savoy cabbage fozelek ] ( http://paleovital.hu/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/kelk%c3%a1posztapasztern%c3%a1kkal1.jpg ) .
