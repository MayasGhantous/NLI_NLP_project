  edit : but the summertime is [ lecso ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lecs%c3%b3 ) - time and that is much more better . 
  that 's what i call a go ahead make my day situation . 
  i am just unwilling to give up those values . 
  it is undeniable that they are the core of the american experience . 
  it is not enough if the us just feeds the world , the us needs to lead the world to ensure the triumph of liberty . 
  that is just econoblahblah . 
  remember that america deserves better than empty theories from eastern liberals and europeans . 
  do n't try to undermine those core values on which this great nation of the new world was built . 
  america is on the right side of history . 
  hungary wanted to quit the war in 1944 , but it was occupied by the germans in march and our regent was arrested in october and hungarian nazis seized power . 
  a new coalition government was formed in debrecen and hungary declared war on germany . 
  communist took over the country and the government totally only in 1948 . 
  soviets occupied and liberated the country at the same time . 
  here is the well known [ song ] ( https://youtu.be/kernkgdzlke ) played everywhere in hungary before 1990 on this day . 
  that is a problem of the political culture not of the presidential system . 
  the russians are not good guests that is for sure , but at least we are here , i am not sure that germans would left romanians and hungarians in their new europe after the war . 
  that is an other question . 
  the fact is a fact : they liberated us . 
  we have to live with that . 
  that was a time of liberations , just like the liberated romanians and bulgarians helped to liberate us , after our liberation we helped to liberate austria . 
  it depends on the cultural and political traditions of a country which one is better . 
  the same presidential system which works well in the us is a failure in a banana republic . 
  for hungary the parliamentary system is the better as the tradition of the national assembly and our constitutional tradition is almost 800 years old . 
  our problem is not with the parliamentary system but with our own little voldemort , who destroyed the checks and balances in the system and made a new constitution which looks good but deep inside it is a bad and unbalanced piece of constitution . 
  okay . 
  what can they do against the most innovative economy in the world fuelled by the explosive mix of american spirit and scientific knowledge ? 
  the us economy is not driven by those who make up theories but it is driven by those people who take initiative , act and make money by implementing the classic american values in everyday life . 
  how could they beat the explosive mix of american spirit and scientific knowledge which fuelling the most innovative economy in the world ? 
  how ? 
  but back in those days ( until late 90s ) smoking was part of everyday communications and social interactions . 
  as for the weed it has a pretty good pr , it is unhealthy if you smoke it it is the same as to smoke tobacco , it has side effects in the long run , but every cool comedian and famous actor promotes it . 
  so for the current pr campaign weed has proper package , i think . 
  yep . 
  borat 's village . 
  after introducing neutral packaging australian smokers number dropped by 15 % . 
  there is got to be a connection . 
  ] ( http://img.thesun.co.uk/aidemitlum/archive/00223/f_200612_december14_223055a.jpg ), 
   no smoker began to smoke because the packaging was `` pretty '' haha . 
  on the contrary . 
  cigarettes is about branding and packaging is an important part of the experience . 
  edit : just google how lucky strike or marlboro rebranded itself from women 's brand to men 's brand or vice versa by change its packaging . 
  edit2 : or gauloises called hongroises but in 1925 they changed the name to boost the sales by patriotism . 
  it worked and smoking gauloises became a patriotic thing . 
  that would be the point of it . 
  in 2013 hvg.hu estimated simicska wealth cca . 
  1 billion euros , and his confidants are also amongst the most wealthy hungarians , but simicska has never been on the yearly list of the wealthiest hungarians as his wealth is not visible , because of this web . 
  from the [ article ] ( http://nol.hu/gazdasag/a-simicska-galaxis-ellen-meg-orban-is-keves-lesz-1525967 ) lajos simicska 's empire is under an unprecedented strong attack in the recent days . 
  the goverment halted the construction of the m4 highway which was built by simicska 's kozgep , the gao examines his media company , the hung-ister and his media empire essentially lost all govermental ads . 
  however the battle is far from over as a huge network is behind lajos simicska . ( ... ), 
  the empire of lajos simicska , who became a pariah from the pm 's closest confidant is similar to the buda-cash and quaestor as its movement could only be followed by a star system mdelling computer . 
  the subempires of his many confidants are orbiting simicska 's empire while some of the tentacles overlaps , some of them are linking and disconneting , some of the members sometimes changes galaxies and some of them just goes out in silence , all has its own history ( ... ) opten database shows that simicska has the direct or indirect ownership of 63 hungarian companies today . 
  this picture could almost be called clear , as previously there were moments when the number of the companies in this group was over 100 . 
  the `` galaxies '' around the great entrepreneur are well known : media , agriculture and industry ( kozgep ) . 
  the picture would not be complete if we do n't mention his confidants working closely with simicska : zsolt nyerges , their lawyer : csaba ajtony nagy , k\u00e1roly fonyo , marianna toth , istvan kovacs , zoltan nagy , zsuzsanna benyo , simicska 's wife : zsuzsanna pusztai and the more or less leaving istvan torocskei , zoltan petyko , tibor gy\u0151ri or gabor liszkay , who was recently separated from this system and was triggered the loudest explosion in the public life in recent years with that step . ( ... ), 
  you damned troll . 
  edit : stop asking stupid questions and buy some airplane tickets and start travelling , maybe you will be less ignorant . 
  maybe just somebody cleaned the lab in the evening . 
  do you want to talk about it ? 
  a not at all aggressive [ italian ] ( https://youtu.be/fahaafzmq_i ) driver . 
  i think he does n't have ac in his old fiat , that is why he drive that fast . 
  you are in the complete denial of any slovak responsibility and you instantly want to show that you are better , because you get rid of slota . 
  it is not just slota , it is a mentality . 
  but it is n't new . 
  it is always the hungarians who cause the trouble . 
  after the malina case and alikes ( like when the slovak police arrested a hungarian teacher in bratislava when he guided his class in the city for guiding tourists without proper papers ) hungarian tourists disappeared from slovakia . 
  then there were reports in the hungarian media , where the head of the tourist office of slovakia ( or something like that ) explained us , that we are idiots if we do n't understand how much slovaks like us . 
  then came an ad in tvs , where a guy told us in hungarian to visit slovakia with a thick slovak accent . 
  i do n't remember how much , but you have enough hungarians to find one without an accent . 
  you just do n't bother , and then you do n't want to understand why we spend our winter holiday in better places . 
  that is the same mentality which i wrote about to lolkac . 
  i told what i wanted and i really fed up with this for today . 
  happy easter , dude . 
  if hungarians were like you , not one romanian would left in transylvania by 1918 . 
  do n't forget that two can play that game , it is better to live in peace and prosperity . 
  it is an interview with a serbian police officer about the atrocities which were committed by his unit in kosovo . 
  crimes against humanity do n't lapse and it is not good to use such arguments like `` it is over '' . 
  for those who were there it is not over . 
  are you kidding ? 
  want to join is a thing and join is an other . 
  just ask turkey . 
   the justification used for recognition are serbian crimes toward albanian population , but those crimes at that point ended 9 years ago . 
  http://www.top-channel.tv/english/artikull.php?id=13880 great job . 
  you have just relativized a genocide . 
   ** not really ** , just ** some ** of them are afraid read your thread . 
  look i understand that i could explain this for you until evening , but you would n't get it . 
  it 's about precedents and fear ( fear of some voters and some politicians ) . 
  it 's like the case of [ benes decrees ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bene%c5%a1_decrees ) or [ j\u00e1nos esterh\u00e1zy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bene%c5%a1_decrees ) or the [ benyovszky statue ] ( http://infovilag.hu/hir-21254-benyovszky_moric_vilagjaro_europai_ket_e.html ) in madagascar ( which was erected by a hungarian guy from his own money and a year later a slovak delegation showed up and changed the table on the statue ) . 
   the city has a strong mafia connection . 
  so the hungarians should be blamed for the dunajska streda mafia ? 
  edit : added link, 
  i am not talking about the present day situation , but you do n't want to understand what is my problem with that meeting at sz\u00e9cs\u00e9ny and that is just sad . 
   ** not really ** , just ** some ** of them are afraid of magyar minority as parts of southern slovakia is full with hungarians and just like hungary , and they always have politicians who are ready to use that fear . 
  tell me that this is not true . 
   that was 2009 . 
  jobik around that time ... come on . 
  jobbik was not even in the hungarian parliament in 2009 . 
  what happened was that a socialist pm of an eu and nato country invited a socialist pm of a bordering eu and nato country to a meeting in a peaceful , small rural town . 
  and fico showed up with machine guns and convoy etc. 
  ( and i did not searched for an actual lmg picture just for an smg one , but they brought lmgs . ), 
  according to you it is ok . come on .
