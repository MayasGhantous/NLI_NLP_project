  does the name radimir cacic ring a bell ? 
  come to hungary in the summer and just watch . 
  you are not the same as home then . 
  not really , just some of them are afraid of magyar minority as parts of southern slovakia is full with hungarians and just like hungary , and they always have politicians who are ready to use that fear . 
  the [ hedvig malina case ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hedvig_malina ) shows that mentality . 
  edit : my favourite [ photo ] ( http://www.blikk.hu/data/cikk/1/99/95/46/cikk_1999546/fico535.jpg ) , in 2009 fico had a meeting with bajnai in a hungarian small town and he arrived with convoy with machine guns and guards , it was like he arrived on peacetalks after a war . 
  strange mentality . 
  you 're right about this . 
  no need to search for ideological reasons in this case . 
  nope . 
  edit : / u/anarchisto already answered it . 
  our history is full of proud moments , hungarians usually are very proud people , we always find something to be proud of . 
  if i have to choose , the proudest moment was the [ siege of eger ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_eger_%281552%29 ) in 1552 . 
  hungarian defenders without any help from the habsburg king ( who was fed up with hungary and the turkish war by then ) defended the castle , which was the `` key of upper hungary '' ( present day slovakia ) . 
  the 19th century romantic novel based on the siege is still one of the most popular ones in hungary . 
  is it okay to say this : lethal aid in english ? 
  seriously i have never heard that . 
  where ? 
  in the us there were mexican wars , canadian wars . 
  they have complicated relationships . 
  just lurking around san juan island if you want to see a grown canadian crying . 
  not only . 
  i think women could be mobilized for civil defense and work service , but not for military service ( and they are not in the database ) . 
  however they can volunteer to serve and women consist more than 20 % of the active forces . 
  sadly hdf has already lost a female soldier , [ judit abraham papp ] ( http://www.gyertyagyujtas.hu/assets/kepek/440x440/0.24947100x1282588732.pjpeg ) kia in 2010 in afghanistan . 
  you 're welcome . 
  i did n't want to play the wise guy , just in my pov it is much more better to be a commander of a refugee camp than a pow camp . 
  that is a great difference . 
  it makes sense as hungary was a neutral country until 1941 , and _ officially _ a neutral country have to guard foreign military personnels in refugee camps to prevent them to join the fight again . 
  i think your family story is true , just the camp was not a pow camp . 
  i think , it was not a pow camp , but rather a refugee camp . 
  we were not in war with poland and many of the polish soldiers in hungary reached egypt or uk before 1941 . 
  there were even hungarian soldiers who [ sided with the ak ] ( http://vs.hu/kozelet/osszes/magyar-katonaknak-avattak-emlektablat-varsonal-0629 ) in the warsaw uprising in 1944 . 
  `` polish refugees , fleeing the treacherous combined german-russian attack , were accommodated in an organized , supportive manner . 
  many of them found room and board in the countryside . 
  by the beginning of october 1939 , no less than 88 camps for polish civilians and 91 camps for the military had been established . 
  until 29 february 1940 , the hungarian red cross had taken care of 30,681 polish military personnel and of approximately 11,000 civilians . 
  the data from 1941 also testify to that the hungarian authorities and private individuals took care of almost fifty thousand poles . 
  in balatonbogl\u00e1r , rev. 
  b\u00e9la varga , member of parliament had established a polish grammar school . '', 
  today a military girlie man , tomorrow an economic girlie man . 
  do n't be a girlie man !, 
   people always give british troops such credit because they have always been professional no . 
  it is because of the built in toilets and water boilers in tanks and armoured vehicles . 
  well , we looking for a good colony in the pacific area , so i spoke with the other hungarians and we gladly buy it , for a price of 4 cents an acre . 
  that is better than the polish offer . 
  just unveiling secret subliminal messages . 
  you have to graduate from a good school . 
  panarin is a kgb graduate . 
  blah blah blah blah blah blah sex blah blah blah blah blah blah slavery blah blah blah blah blah blah, 
  in the case of hungary it would be better to say , that we suspended drafting , but we have compulsory military service . 
  we do n't have military drafting since 2004 , but according to our constitution , every hungarian citizen 's duty is to defend the homeland , by military , civil defense or work service . 
  in a `` preventive defensive situation '' the national assembly and in war the national defense committee can order a draft , but if we were attacked it would start automatically . 
  hungary has 1.7 million people in the drafting database and the drafting system was tested in the last year ( [ refill 2014 ] ( http://szegedma.hu/hir/szeged/2014/10/tobb-mint-masfelmillio-magyar-ragadhat-fegyvert-ha-baj-van-fotok.html ) ) . 
  it has potential , but when will it realize that ? 
  i have to mention the comparable great russian political scientist , who foresaw the 2010 disintegration of usa , [ igor panarin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/igor_panarin ) . 
  the whole interview is too long to post here and i can not insert the link in the text because of the spam filter .

  edit : the [ same ] ( https://youtu.be/-ibehzppvu8?t=54s ) song from 1981 ( if someone says `` the concert '' in hungary , that means this concert ) . 
  best anti-war poem is babits 's [ before easter ] ( http://www.c3.hu/~eufuzetek/en/eng/14/index.php?mit=babits ) written in the spring of 1916 : '' ... oh peace !, 
  come peace ! / we want peace again ! / let us breathe again ! / the dead do not seek revenge , / the dead do not mind us . / brothers , if we stay alive , / leave the past behind us . / who was guilty ? 
  never ask , / plant the fields with flowers , / let us love and understand / this great world of ours : / some shall go their work to do , / some their dead to witness : / may god give us bread and wine , / drink up , to forgiveness ! '', 
  indeed . 
  true and strange at the same time . 
  maybe it is because you never had a common state or king and your rebels did not emigrate there as frequently as hungarians did . 
  the hungarian red army was not about just bolshevism . 
  most of its officers later became officers in the horthy-army . 
  i really do n't know . 
  statistics could show croatia , because everyone wants to go there in the summer . 
  do n't need to apologise , we have the jobbik , they are greater russian fans than orban . 
  those guys who still like orban are the piskorski kind of people or kaczy\u0144ski 's ? 
   investing in renewable energies years ago i was being harassed on phone by a broker from the far east who wanted me to invest in algae oil and used my name constantly in a wrong order . 
  in the end he wanted just 100 dollars ( `` i spend more on lunch a day than that '' - he said ) to prove what a great investment it is . 
  i have never heard algae oil since then . 
  it 's okay , no hard feelings . 
   orban sucking up to russians really does n't do you any favours ... 
  strange , but we still have polish orban fans here on our national holidays with big flags . 
   you are the nation poles like most in the entire world !, 
  yeah , it hurts .

  i do , but all that submeme together is even worse . 
  full of hate speech . 
   edit : [ know your bans ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30ulo9/reurope_has_an_amazing_new_shiny_revised_set_of/ ), 
  you are an inch away from being reported for hate speech . 
  behave yourself young glennznl . 
  i think that the ceasefires in ukraine clearly corresponds with the [ rasputitsa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rasputitsa ) . 
  it is like the eastern front of the ww2 again , the russians attacks when it 's freezing or in the summer . 
  he should stay there .

   i 'm a little unsure how the finnish language was formed [ really ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uralic_languages ) ? 
  you stabbed me in the heart . 
  and swedes made it into a proper language ? 
  what about the kalevala and vainamoinen ? 
  ( edit : we had to learn parts from that in school in hungary , do n't tell me that it was in vain . ), 
  man , those who always can distinguish good and evil , those are the real assholes with fake moral high grounds .
