  - countvontroll it is just an opinion , but i think you should not do your job like a lawnmower . 
  fear - and warmongering are not the same like a not well sourced infographic or map . 
  in the case of my recent [ submission ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30gwgs/totally_useless_friday_gdp_map_of_europe_with_a/ ) you removed a [ map ] ( http://imgur.com/ikcet4w ) which had the data on the right side of the image and after i provided a source in the comments , a wikipedia page , i did not get an answer from you ( edit : and you removed a submission which had 20 + comments in 30 minutes ) . 
  countvontroll seems to had a similar experience . 
  i am more than happy to get an explanation , thank you . 
  how can we inform you if we provide a source for a submission , in what form we should provide it and how much time we have for that ? 
  i do n't have any theories , that was a joke ( like the revolution and the talk about it ) , sorry if it was not clear . 
  i just wanted to get a better answer than : `` with this , this have been removed '' and i am glad as i have got some already . 
   want to live up to the power-trip mod stereotype , this is exactly how to do it . 
   the lack of reply when i pointed out it was the suggested title were really bad form that gave a vibe of mods somehow being generous ... you are absolutely right my dear graf . 
  ok , but maybe a warning before they delete it ? 
  they delete submissions with 30 + comments . 
  i asked because of the mention of farewell to slavianka , but then it 's ok , you 're right . 
  i do n't want to initiate witch-hunt but a certain mod started to delete submissions because of lack of source a few days ago . 
  about a 15 minutes ago he ruined the third good submission & discussion in 3 days , where i was present and who knows what else happened with other submissions where i was not . 
  so i try to make some buzz about it . 
  noble feelings , but let me ask what is the main problem of the op , humans killing each other or slavs killing each other ? 
  if the later , that is not good enough for me . 
  a two years old article from [ nepszabadsag ] ( http://nol.hu/belfold/20130201-forro_ugyek-1363651 ) ( biggest lefty/liberal newspaper ) about the issue but in hungarian . 
  akos kriza and co. are from oradea , and they were all graduated from the ady liceum according to the article . 
  if you need help with the translation i can make a brief translation in english tomorrow , but i think you can handle it . 
  those romanians in hungary are hungarians born in romania . 
  they have some influence because of their cohesion but they are not pro-romanian , some of them consider themselves better than romanians or hungarians ( like in the joke : are you a hungarian ? 
  better : a szekler . ), 
  sometimes it is a bit disappointing like in miskolc , where the fidesz mayor speak in romanian with his closest political allies who are also born in romania ( not about literature of course , but about political or business issues , using romanian as a crypting ) . 
  most of the romanian citizens in hungary are ethnic hungarians born in romania .

  i do n't think that was the meaning of that sentence as it is not the r/home _ improvement . 
  watch out because if you can not control your lying , you will keep lying even without wanting it . 
  telling to a guy who start to talk about people as animals ? 
  it is . 
  why ? 
  he has a whole karma and a 27 minutes old account . 
  believe me , i really do n't like your kind but i would not report you because of your opinion . 
  however if you need my permission for pushing your dirty agenda , then permission denied of course , go to sleep .

  come on . 
  what a coward you are as you made an account just for this comment . 
  go back under your rock . 
  good and interesting article . 
  as a european sometimes it is hard to decide if the american politicians do believe in these moral arguments in foreign policy or just use them to feed their voters . 
   evangelical conservative republican christians are far more pro netanyahu and pro-israel i think it is just because of the revelation . 
  if every jew left the us that would be a proof for them . 
  because of the mountains . 
  i would search for a fine cliff and from there i would start to look at the hungarian plains [ like this ] ( https://imgflip.com/i/jg0eg ) . 
  it is totally natural , they have a `` mission '' in the first years . 
  i have a cousin who became a newborn or born-again christian ( i do n't know the correct name for it ) , she is a nice girl , but she was barely tolerable for a year or two .

  it is clear now that montenegro desperately wants to join nato .

  ak 47 's accuracy is good for a common soldier .

  it seems like greed , but that poverty is just our poverty exported to those countries to ensure the political stability at home ( moreover us poverty and eastern european poverty are not the same . ), 
  not just philosophical as most of the rich bring his wealth to offshore accounts and avoid taxation . 
  i used that as an example in hungary . 
  it is relevant as the suzuki is the basic car in my country , hungary and with fiat and chevrolet ( daewoo ) etc.
