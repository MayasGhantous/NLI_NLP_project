  us , british and french nuclear weapons are not nuclear capabilities of the eu . 
  also `` sharing '' is misleading in nato as it is obama who decides on when , where and who gets the surprise package , not juncker or merkel . 
  ( edit : and nato is not eu ) the old problem is still here : we do n't know if the us would start a global nuclear war because of europe or would not . 
  and we have a new problem , a russian leader who makes brezhnev look like a reasonable man . 
  and the snake !, 
   the number of billionaires pretty much doubles every 5 years , so that article is disingenuous in suggesting something is out of the norm . 
  something is out of the norm and it is the struggling of the poor these days . 
  the rich , as i wrote earlier , are fine . 
  you know , `` if a free society can not help the many who are poor , it can not save the few who are rich '' . 
   also it 's always the poor who pay are usually not taxed highly during booms how is that possible ? 
  if there is a boom , that means an income growth for even the poor and the poor will pay the taxes because they ca n't afford offshore practices and bribes . 
  one of the main problems is that our goverments work locally , but the financial and business world went global years ago . 
   and suzuki , fiat , and chevrolet have been struggling for decades . 
  it is in hungarian , but check out this [ report ] ( http://www.suzuki.hu/pages/display/magyar_suzuki_zrt./menu/hirek/sajtoszoba ) of the hungarian suzuki co. 
  on the domestic market suzuki sold 32338 vehicles in 2008 and 1990 in 2011 . 
  i wo n't search data for the other two as they do n't manufacture their cars in hungary . 
  no she is assimilated . 
  hungarians are like borg . 
  that means a farewell to ciorba de peste and a hello to the fisherman 's soup . 
  it seems like he ( or some other high ranking fidesz-hussar ) went balls deep and loved every minute of it . 
  why did you stop at the middle of the section ? 
  let me help you :  his generally accepted birthplace was in the freidorf ( szabadfalu ) suburb of the current city of timi\u0219oara , romania ( german : temeschburg , hungarian : temesv\u00e1r ) the village is in romania . 
  however , the ship 's roster from his family 's arrival at ellis island lists his birthplace as p\u00e1rd\u00e1ny , kingdom of hungary , in what is today a village in serbia , not far from the romanian border . 
  not according to wikipedia . 
  strange but seems true . 
  if you look the current borders tarzan still born in serbia , not in timisoara . 
  i do n't but you should tell that to mila kunis either . 
  yes , the counter-sakharov . 
   volfswagen that is epic , never heard it , but good . 
   violent revolution and the forcible re-appropriation of assets is bad . 
  well , let me continue my commie propaganda about right and bad from a communist pov : '' ... this people 's power is of course punishing some people , and for other people it is drawing the line . 
  but it is inevitable . 
  ( laughter . ), 
  the power of the state has always been a power and it will be the same in the future . 
  as for the present , the world is such that there are two kinds of this power . 
  the one where the privileged few keep the people in terror and fear , and imprison the communists and the warriors of peace . 
  this is the much applauded western way of power , even if it is called democracy . 
  and there is the another power , where the counts , the landowners and the agents of the capitalists imprisoned for a little to bring them down from the clouds . 
  ( laughter and applause . ), 
  without this , the working people can not live a free life . 
  of course , there are people who do not like that . 
  but what should we do ? 
  we can not make such a system , what everyone likes . 
  ( laughter . ), 
  what manfred weiss likes , our comrade who works in his former factory at csepel probably does not . 
  ( laughter . ), 
  what he likes , that is not good for manfred weiss . 
  ( laughter . ), 
  and if we have to choose , then we say that we want to keep , protect and enforce a system which is liked by five million workers and not one which is liked by 300,000 capitalists and their butlers .

  that 's right !,

  - i suppose you know , that most of them or their ancestors forced to left the country because of the opinion of random extremist mps from left and right . 
  sometimes i am amazed that they do n't punch the face of the random riporters as they start the interview with the `` you , as a hungarian ... '' mila jovovich is a good example as she supports ukraine with humanitarian assistance ( as a half-russian , half-serbian ) .

  and you 're all welcome . 
  mila kunis was very [ straightforward ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/mila-kunis-refuses-to-discuss-ukraine-in-particularly-cold-interview-9562106.html ) about ukraine after she was called [ `` zhydovka '' ] ( http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/mila-kunis-target-anti-semitic-slur-made-ukrainian-politician-article-1.1225394 ) .

   i am working on learning hungarian since i live in hungary . 
  it is kicking my ass . 
  learning hungarian was a child 's play to me . 
  :d watch tv and movies in hungarian ( there are plenty of them on youtube ) with hungarian subs and it will be much easier . 
  no need to watch something like `` k\u0151sz\u00edv\u0171 ember fiai '' or `` egri csillagok '' , some dubbed comedy can do the trick . 
  thank you and i appreciate your help . 
  i am not offended at all and sadly i am not smarter than the average . 
   it 's possible this was offered to him as a course of action and he refused . 
  that would mean he choosed to be sacked , because no employer can or even should tolerate his employee on high ground . 
   udo j\u00fcrgens is comparable he is , it was udo j\u00fcrgens ' viele dank f\u00fcr die blumen which started me to listen lady karneval .

  i will not answer the question , because i will end up with tar and feathers as a commie . 
  it is not sure . 
  there are people who just say it and say it and eventually infuriate themselves . 
  that is why psychology and - iatry are flourishing . 
  this is bad . 
  the normal solution for this would be a public apology from clarkson with the producer on his side and a few months long psychiatric treatment and after that a few report about a happy clarkson in the tabloids . 
  instead of this they kill their own milking cow . 
  as for hungary here is our cs gy\u00f6rgy korda with [ lady karneval in hungarian ] ( https://youtu.be/g5-trrwljts ) and his own [ lady n ] ( https://youtu.be/gzfhy24b4fs ) . 
  it shows that gott is well-known here . 
  an old [ ihm parody ] ( https://youtu.be/y7ygnjkxgh0 ) in hungarian of gott 's song but it is rather a parody of the whole phenomenon . 
  ( `` you just dancingova nyet cry , nyet must / pozor pivo palinka nyet slurping / and if the girl nyet comes , there will be nyet playful carneval / do n't even stroke it ... '' ),
