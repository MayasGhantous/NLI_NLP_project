  if not , then that is an evil and nationalist warmonger country ( possibly dictatorship ) who just bring discord to this world of peace and harmony or ( if that country in these days is just sitting on a bench and eating his sandwich ) at least has a potential to do that and the good countries of the world would better watch out before it starts a war again . 
  you know they were the same good old czechs back than , it was not some kind of a nuclear wasteland . 
  in hungary there was always a problem between the hungarians and the romas , `` what we have here is a failure to communicate '' and most of them just do n't want to integrate . 
  it became a real problem after 1990 , when after the failure of the positive integration of the socialism no one wanted to integrate them anymore . 
  but , as i see it , the open racism ( like racism on the street etc. ), 
  just started after 2006 , after the speech of \u00d6sz\u00f6d , because the protests after that gave a chance to the radical right , as the dehumanizing of the political adversaries , which started by orban 's fidesz when they lost the elections of 2002 became common after that speech ( like burning of the `` it 's not gyurcs\u00e1ny , just it looks like gyurcs\u00e1ny '' - strawmen around the country and such ) . 
  after that there was two `` gypsy-crimes '' which boosted the anti-roma sentiment in hungary . 
  the first was the lynching at olaszliszka in 2006 , when a teacher ( lajos sz\u00f6gi , 44 ) with his children ( 14 and 5 years old girls ) in his car was driving through that village street ( he was obeying the law , not speeding , not drunk ) , when a gypsy girl ( 11 ) ran on the pavement . 
  the car braked and the girl was barely hurt and the driver wanted to help . 
  however , a gathering of relatives and neighbours thought someone was ran over , pulled the man from the car , and beat him to death in front of his daughters . 
  and after that in 2009 came the [ veszpr\u00e9m stabbing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/veszpr%c3%a9m_stabbing ) , when gypsies attacked marian cozma , ivan pesic and zarko sesum , and as the wikipedia put it correctly : `` the recordings of the camera over the stairway show cozma running up to the exit pursued by his attackers . 
  in front of the bar , cozma was stabbed in the back , and he collapsed . 
  raffael then went up to him and stabbed him twice in the heart . 
  when his teammates wanted to help cozma , the other two attackers - sztojka and n\u00e9meth - stabbed pe\u0161i\u0107 in the kidney and kicked \u0160e\u0161um in the head . '', 
  cozma murdered , pesic and sesum was seriously injured and most of the country became fed up with the romas . 
  [ live updates from russian media ] ( http://fortruss.blogspot.hu/2015/03/konstantinovka-revolt-live-updates.html ), 
  yep , that business is booming these days . 
  that would be bad news for european children ... do n't get up - i 'll show myself out . 
  of course . 
  after they spend 80 billion forints ( 266 million euros ) from public money a year , the ceo managed to say yesterday , that only who is not working can not make a mistake , and everyone criticize them because of the good quality of their work , and because their viewers are so many . 
  the evening news of the m1 ( their most viewed program ) had 400k viewers last saturday , while the rtl news had 1200k viewers . 
  that is the same with beef if proud eastern european food industry is involved . 
  you should always wonder if it is made from cattle or horse . 
  like the italian lire , when they wrote phone numbers on 1000 lire notes . 
   how much could we save and use for more productive things ... like building a temple for the antichrist . 
  we never , i repeat , we never let that happen . 
  how would our political elite manage to change their forints from shady businesses to euros ? 
  what would our people say when they 'll get their first salary in euros ? 
  euro would be a nightmare . 
  very wise citizens of videgr\u00e1di group countries , help !, 
  what is the meaning of the existence of the visegr\u00e1di group beside pms smiling at each other and have a lunch ? 
  you read it in the necro-files ? 
  they do n't need to , because everyone of them has a sword which turns blue when putin is close . 
  i do n't have time to search for more sources , but if it is not enough maybe more would not be enough either . 
  but if you have a preposition , like a good slovakian patriot ( ie . 
  the slovak nationalists of 1848 were the forerunners of the modern slovak nation and all others were traitors or hungarians like me just liars ) that would not be enough . 
  in that case you should consider , that there were loyal habsburg subjects even among the hungarians and 1848 was not just black and white . 
  like gen. heinrich hentzi who bombarded the civilians of pest in 1849 was born in debrecen , hungary and his family lived there . 
  ** mih\u00e1ly horv\u00e1th ** , who was a roman catholic priest ( some 30 years later he became a bishop ) and was a minister of the szemere cabinet in 1848 wrote that : `` the patriotism of the people of upper hungary even under the most dire circumstances of our independence war was always blameless , they sent their battalions to our goverment like our own hungarian kind did , and many of that battalions became the most valiant of our batallions . '', 
  pest 1871 . 
  ** hunfalvy p\u00e1l ** ( who was a german and his name was ** paul hunsdorfer ** ) wrote in his memoirs that at kassa ( kosice ) `` stur made a speech in slovak to the citizens of kosice , but they do n't listen even if they understood him . 
  he then called in peasant peoples , but they answered that they will not rebel against the hungarians . '', 
  214 . l. ) ** col. lajos beniczky ** , goverment commisioner of the mining towns was a slovak and he spoke slovakian language better than hungarian ( which he spoke poorly ) . 
  any time when he recruited soilders in the slovakian villages all young men joined the hungarian army . 
  the slovak peasants called him the prince of the slovaks and austrian intelligence reported that the slovakian peasants of the region all joined kossuth 's army . 
  benyiczky wrote in his memoirs and in his contemporaly reports to the cabinet that the slovak national council hardly recruited 2000 slovaks in the highlands ( contemporaly name for slovakia ) . 
  fontes , 1924 . 
  208 . l. ) the ** battle of branisko ** was an important battle on february 5 1849 , when the army of the upper danube under the command of col. richard guyon ( who himself was an englishman and a hungarian patriot ) defetead the imperial troops under gen. deym 's command at branisko pass ( after hungarian troops spent a long and bloody winter campaign with retreat in the mountains ) and forced its way to join the hungarian army at the river tisza to start the spring offensive of 1849 . 
  in this battle the spearhead of the hungarian troops were the ** 1st ** and ** 2nd ** ** beszterceb\u00e1nyai ( banska bistrica ) battalions ** ( later 51st and 124th honved battalions ) which were recruited in the mining towns and were slovakians . 
  their attack was leaded a slovak piarist father named polesny who was `` a good slovakian patriot who lead his people in the charge with a cross '' . 
  100 . l. ) we should remember those hungarians , germans , slovaks , italians and poles and romanians ( romanians of hungary supported the revolution , not like most romanians in transylvania , but nowadays it is inconvenient for the romanian nationalism ) and even serbs ( like our national hero , john damjanich , who considered a traitor by those serbs who want to `` remove goulash from vojvodina '' like one serbian put it in this topic ) who fought for the ideas of the revolution and for freedom as comrade in arms . 
  the main divide was not the nationality back then , it was rebels ( democrats ) vs. imperial ( autocrats ) and the imperial court manipulated the nationalities of hungary to reach its goal : to lengthen autocrat habsburg rule over central europe from krakow to milano and from temesvar to prague . 
  anyway i appreciate that guys from every neighbouring countries showed up here in this topic to tell us , hungarians , that we know everything wrong abot one of our greatest holidays and about our greatest national heroes . 
  interesting , but even the smallest coastline is infinite if you start to measure it . 
  a few thousand slovak and moravian nationalists by the minimal support of vienna tried to attack the revolution and they were forced to retreat by the hungarian national guard . 
  ** it is a fact that more than ten thousands slovak volunteers fought in that national guard on the side of the revolution against the slovak natonal council . 
  ** it is surprising how vehemently you support every nationalistic views with the exception of hungarian nationalism . 
  you know anti-hungarians wo n't like you if you are a hungarian , no matter how hard you support their cause because of your ethnicity . 
  if you are not a hungarian , then cancel may last remark of course . 
   who gives a fuck about what hungary thinks . 
  strange comment considering the topic . 
  i do n't want to kick the beehive of the national myths of the serbs , but [ this guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alfred_i,_prince_of_windisch-gr%c3%a4tz ) was the commander of the imperial troops in hungary , the  the austrian general georg rukavina baron von vidovgrad was the commander of temesvar and spent the war encircled there . 
  the elders of the reddit . 
  that looks like a big crap at debaltseve . 
  a brigade retreat in groups of 15-20 people without its heavy equipment . 
  hopeless situation as they do n't have the military force to stop russia , nato not willing to help and the russians do n't negotiate . 
  it is like croatia in 1992 . 
  first they should stabilize the situation and build up a military . 
  absolutely . 
  for me this is the main sentence in this interview : `` the downsizing of the ukrainian military had been continious ... putin has long planned to wage war against the weakening ukraine ... '' and the '' ... people wanted to create new , modern and strong army made of volunteers , but due to corruption and deals that was made impossible ... '' from the polish article . 
  about the [ retreat from debaltseve ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2z43p4/hungarian_veterans_of_the_ukrainian_armys_128th/ ) from soilders pov . 
   retreat from debaltseve was n't necessary , but it was forced on soldiers . 
   what happens is another ribbentrop-molotov pact . 
  well ... 
  that would be an awesome name for a double headed dildo . 
  after their arrival they will surely get better and blow up something . 
  would you fight for a hiding place ? 
  [ the russians are coming . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/ybcbhg8rw6w ), 
  i do n't know . 
  maybe it is easier to put someone in the coffin that way . 
  better . 
  a bearded phoenix . 
  believe me , you do n't want to be at home ( like anywhere in poland or europe or north-america ) when nato quickly taking out russian strategic nuclear capability . 
  russia should immediately annex a few smaller states somewhere around her mighty territory if the baltic states will become little nato crusader kingdoms armoured by the evil warmonger powers of the western imperialism against the glorious mother russia and its peace-loving leaders . 
  the revolutionaries of 1848 were not nationalist . 
  if you look at the later life of kossuth or klapka , kmety or t\u00fcrr , you should notice that they were liberal internationalists . 
  they believe in liberty , equality and fraternity and the hungarian emigration fought for that values from italy ( the expedition of the thousand ) to the crimean war ( against the russian czar 's tyranny ) and also in the civil war ( more than a hundred officers in the union army ) for the north . 
  we should n't blame those people who fought for freedom for the failure of the whole political elite of the empire some 60 years later . 
  i saw the comments and it seems that every not hungarian here wanted to blame the revolution for problems which were not caused by the revolution . 
  ( edit : spelling ), 
  the real pro-tip from the hungarian military : if you hear the `` nuklear flash on the right/left ! '', 
  you should lie down on your rifle with your head to the opposite direction and your hands beneath your chest . 
  he was quite a good athlete . 
  my brain has stormed and i came up with the perfect austro-hungarian compromise : bearded sisi . 
  just almost everyone in hungary . 
  we will come back if you elect a habsburg emperor . 
  with a nice mustache , if possible . 
  today is a [ national holiday ] ( http://visitbudapest.travel/budapest-events/march-15th-national-holiday/ ) in hungary with plenty of free programs around the country . 
  edit : most important news of the week ( beside the national holiday ) was that [ brussels blocked the russian deal about paks power plant ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/energy/brussels-blocks-hungarys-nuclear-deal-russia-312874 ) .
