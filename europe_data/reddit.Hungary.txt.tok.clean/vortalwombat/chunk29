  since then putin went missing and orban is a bit indisposed either . 
  modern day europeans are not domesticated , just living in law and order . 
  30 years ago yugoslavia was a modern country but there was a point when neighbours started to kill each other . 
  few years before they were surely drinking together in the pub and played poker on sundays . 
  as my uncle told me based on what he saw in 1956 `` you do n't need a gun , because when you will need one , you will get one without asking for it . '', 
  yes , but people back in the 40s could n't believe either that the civilized germans can do that . 
  i watched a show about a similar us ship on natgeo and that did n't learned it well . 
  you only find moderate ones at guantanamo . 
  it 's quite suicidal from the muslims to help to forget the holocaust . 
  if a genocide of that scale would ever happen again in europe against a minority , it 's obvious who will be the new jews : the muslims . 
  they cut the branch they are sitting on . 
  mr. juncker stated that late at night he toss and he turn and he dream of what he needs ... 
  he need an army , he is holding out for an army 'til the end of the night , it 's got ta be strong and it 's got ta be fast and it 's got ta be fresh from the fight . 
  he needs an army !, 
  `` i love rumors !, 
  facts can be so misleading , where rumors , true or false , are often revealing . '', 
   i think what you tried to say when you said what you said is that he was an informant for the soviets . 
  i 'm ready to learn how to be an informant for an economic theory , though . 
  that is how we call them in hungary and in the ex-eastern bloc countries : communist informant . 
  it is not about marx , eastern europe saw communism working in practice and those people who made it work was called themselves communists . 
  you know if someone openly declares himself a communist we should take his word for it . 
  do you mean kolontar ? 
  9 deaths , several chemical injuries and a few hundred citizen relocated from their homes ? 
  i am glad you had fun .

  `` bright red blood flows instead of water in the tapolca stream in the town of p\u00e1pa , hungary . 
  it 's clear that the nearby meat processing plant is the polluter and not for the first time . 
  it happened ` accidentaly ' a dozen times . 
  the phenomenon can be seen up to a few hours , and then the blood is carried away by the stream , only huge fatty chunks remain , which the local rats like to eat . 
  neither the company nor the city leadership has done anything against the pollution until now . '',

  i am sorry , because i do n't have time for a more detailed answer , but i would like to clear some of my points to avoid misunderstanding :  relative calm periods & collapse after 1740 there was a threat of collapse for the austrian empire in every major conflict ( 1740 , 1763 - lost influence in germany , 1790-1815 , 1849 , 1866 , 1914 ) and they survived most of the time because the international community wanted to preserve the empire . 
  ofc they survived the calm periods , empires usually do n't collapse in peacetime and without the ww1 they would be still be here to stir things . 
   monocausal history i did n't want to say anything like that . 
  all i wanted to say is that without the ottoman pressure there would n't have been multinational empires in central europe . 
   after karlovitz 1699 ( at the latest after the treaty of belgrade 1739 ) the ottoman empire posed no real threat i agree . 
  but after that the international community always saved the habsburgs ' throne , because of the european balance of power or a good marriage ( 1810 ) or because of conservativism and the divine right of the monarchs ( 1849 ) . 
  yes . 
  because of that and the war of the spanish succession they ended up with central and eastern european territories with different laws and customs and they were struggled with creating a unified state for centuries . 
  after the war of the austrian succession they were always on the verge of collapse and survived until 1918 only thanks to the international politics . 
  the habsburg and jagellonian monarchy or the empire of matthias corvinus were created only because of the ottomans . 
  without them the different estates would have never accept the unification and a multinational empire . 
  100 years ago it caused a world war , but today ... hungary sent several police units to balkan countries to help them with the immigration , slovak , polish etc. 
  policemen arrived to hungary with the same goal , hungaroring always has a mixed hungarian , slovak , polish , austrian , romanian police force , there are also foreign police officers at the lake balaton in the summer and hungarian policemen patrol the croatian coast during vacation season etc. 
  so it 's fairly common . 
  short answer : it was because of turkey . 
  detailed answer : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_question, 
  yep , what you gon na do when they come for you ? 
  [ hungarian situation ] ( http://www.police.hu/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/images/20162704141218.jpg?itok=uto_bu0u ), 
  exactly . 
  europe was n't full that time . 
  book of the week : a race for purity - the history of the german beer by max mustermann, 
   britain contained some of the most developed areas outside of italy . 
  more developed than africa , lybia , egypt , asia , galatia , cilicia , cyprus , judea , syria , cappadocia , pontus , bythinia , macedonia , achaea , sicilia , narbonensis , baetica , just to name a few . 
  sure . 
  we will rename it gondor on the day when aragorn von habsburg returns , right after prime steward orban jumped out of the parliament 's window . 
  it 's just a matter of time , now that mordor released a great darkness toward canada . 
  that is what the romanians say when they run out of honey : `` bye-oh-honey ! '', 
  i tasted it when i was a kid and i can tell you it 's not for kids or at least not for central european kids , mainly because of the black olives . 
  but i will try it again sometime , because french meals are usually good , so maybe it was me who was n't ready for this . 
  a really hungarian pizza is the [ piedone pizza ] ( https://falatozz.hu/kepek/receptek/000/065/400x/piedone-pizza.jpg ) which is made with marinara sauce , onion , bean , cheese , bacon and mozzarella and it clearly shows the hungarian people 's deep feelings towards bud spencer and his [ beans with onion ] ( https://youtu.be/c0itxq-ftls?t=1m39s ) . 
  i see . 
  then the most popular here is the sour cream and cheese topping , yoghurt is not widely used . 
  but you can put nearly anything on a langos , from ketchup to nutella . 
  sometimes they wrap a hotdog in langos dough , but only really hungry hungarians can eat that . 
  all you need for a langos is flour , yeast , water , salt and some sugar and milk for the yeast , so yes , these are pretty cheap ingredients . 
  based on what i read when i googled the pictures i think that the mcd european hq chooses a plan and they use it for some years everywhere in europe . 
  so for example , a medium size mcd in dublin built in 2006 is nearly identical to every same size mcd built in the same year anywhere in europe .

  no , that is made for mcdonalds ( and a fuel station , maybe ) only . 
  it 's in batumi , georgia and it 's really unique and also very cool inside .

  thanks , i saw this one , only i could n't find a bigger pic , that 's why i chose the other one . 
  this is a really nice one , much better than the average green-brown combo . 
  the < 75 part is far too general . 
  i think [ this one ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/a/a7/regional_disparities_in_gross_domestic_product_%28gdp%29_per_inhabitant%2c_in_purchasing_power_standard_%28pps%29%2c_by_nuts_level_2_region%2c_2013_%28%c2%b9%29_%28%25_of_the_eu-28_average%2c_eu-28_%3d_100%29_ryb15.png ) is more informative . 
  if you have some better pictures or pictures of a unique mcd from your country , please feel free to post it . 
  what is your fav chocolate ? 
  mainly the not real chocolates like mars , snickers , twix , kit-kat etc. 
  what is the best chocolate in your country ? 
  if you mean best local brand , it 's [ boci ] ( http://www.nestle.hu/brands/edessegek/boci ) , otherwise it 's obviously toblerone . 
  my main problems concerning the hungarian chocolate market are : every hungarian `` premium '' chocolate is full with alcohol and nestle crunch is no longer available here . 
  edit : youtube user [ emmymadeinjapan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/emmymadeinjapan/featured ) tasted hungarian sweets 3 times [ [ 1 ] ( https://youtu.be/_kny2kia9nm ) ] . 
  ( i think over the years she tasted almost all local european candies . ), 
  translation : `` man from the audience ran to the stage to defend antigone - the audience of the bethlen square theatre witnessed an awesome scene : a man could not stand to watch the flogging of [ antigone ] ( http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/antigone/summary.html ) and he rushed to the stage to rescue the greek heroine . 
  `` you ca n't hurt her any longer ! '', 
  said the well dressed cca . 
  45-50 years old man , while he threw himself on the actor who played the guard . 
  the surreal case was told to szinhaz.hu by tamas g. egressy , the leader of the spirita group , who was also threatened by the man when tried to intervene . 
  `` are you a dictator ? 
  i 'll kill you ! '', 
  groaned the man and he tried to grab egressy 's arm . 
  he was banned from the theatre . 
  the whole audience and the members of the group watched the man in stunned silence . 
  the music was stopped , the lights went on and two employees escorted the man out of the theater and not allowed him to return .
