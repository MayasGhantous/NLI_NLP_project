  that 's a british conspiracy . 
  send hollande to quebec . 
  i mean a lot of hungarians should be diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder . 
  it 's simple ; we love to use hot or mild paprika powder and various green , red bell and [ wax ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_wax_pepper ) peppers ( also called paprika ) in cooking , it 's the core of the traditional hungarian cuisine . 
  in the second half of the 16th century , a noble lady , margit sz\u00e9chy already had a plant in her garden called the turkish pepper aka paprika . 
  the industrial [ spice-paprika ] ( http://www.bigg.hu/harmonia/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/paprika.jpg ) cultivation started in the region of [ szeged ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/szeged ) in the 19th century , on the black-sand-soiled fields near to the city , which were frequently flooded by the river [ tisza ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tisza ) . 
  in 1934 szeged and its area was declared a protected zone , so paprika powder from outside of this area was forbidden to sell as szeged paprika . 
  today there are two main and protected paprika production places in hungary : szeged and [ kalocsa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalocsa ) . 
  the hungarian paprika is made by milling of the ripened , after-ripened , and dried pods of traditional cultivated paprika grown on fields surrounding these two cities , which are favorable areas for growing the plant as in these two regions the temperature , sun , and rainfall circumstances are the most favorable of all the agricultural lands for red pepper cultivating . 
  the hungarian paprika has its special features due to these favorable conditions and the several century old tradition of the professional knowledge and processing . 
  also [ albert szent-gy\u00f6rgyi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albert_szent-gy%c3%b6rgyi ) , who got the nobel prize because he discovered the vitamin c , discovered the vitamin c in the paprika . 
  he tried several fruits and vegetables and one day his wife packed wax pepper for him to lunch . 
  as szent-gy\u00f6rgyi did n't like paprika at all , he did not eat that , instead he tested it for vitamin c and found it a rich source . 
  it must be torrente . 
  dude , that was rich . 
  no need to use this subsaharan shit , let the n word roll out . 
  so your opinion tl ; dr : `` we welcome change and openness ; for we believe that freedom and security go together , that the advance of human liberty can only strengthen the cause of world peace . 
  there is one sign the orban cabinet can make that would be unmistakable , that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace . 
  prime minister orban , if you seek peace , if you seek prosperity for hungary and eastern europe , if you seek liberalization , come here to this gate . 
  mr. orban , open this gate . 
  mr. orban , tear down this wall ! '', 
  europe should invade uruguay . 
  good location , climate , football and it 's the second smallest country there . 
  usually their children are their retirement policy . 
  that 's right , but their main investor is china in these days . 
   after hundreds of years of europe and the * western * world exploiting africa for it 's natural resources the script will be flipped .

  eventually the economy of those regions and countries will improve , just like the chinese or indian did , so you 'd better afraid of this : http://www.politico.eu/article/angola-portugal-investment-economy/, 
  paprika , borderline personality disorder and alcoholism .

  translation : '' ... no one can tell where or how the border fence will be built . 
  currently , the official position is that no new dirt road will be built on the mole-rat habitat or fence columns will not beaten down , but they will put out a so-called nato-wire , which does not interfere with the mole rats under normal conditions . 
  but the southern mole-rat is currently living in extreme conditions , so constantly moving on the surface , and there are concerns that the wire can catch them . 
  in the present circumstances , even the loss of one pet is a huge loss ( an intangible items value of huf 1.2 million or cca . 
  4000 euros ) compared to earlier opportunities but it is still the best scenario . 
  all the experts agree that the species is in their the last hour , and that the milder variation of the closing of the border can be sufficient to wipe out the branch at [ kelebia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kelebia ) from the face of the earth . '',

  i beleive the op , as sure , the op is an honorable man , but is there a source for the title ? 
  maybe it will not be a popular opinion here , but i would go with solzhenitsyn in this question . 
  most of the crimes you mentioned in this thread , were committed by the bolsheviks ( or before that by the czarist government , which was an opressive and not democratically elected government ) and not by the russian people . 
  russians were not the ruling nation in the soviet union . 
  all the traditional culture of all ethnic groups were equally oppressed by the bolsheviks , in favor of atheism and marxist-leninism in the soviet union . 
  a bolshevik/communist is not russian , german , polish , czech , slovak , hungarian , romanian or bulgarian . 
  they are internationalists and not nationalists . 
  it 's a pity and a crime itself that the current rulers , the ruling elite of russia denies that crimes , but that does n't change the main thing : the blame is on the bolsheviks for the 20th century crimes . 
  i also blame the western world , because it was let russia to slip into anarchy under yeltsin , they supported gaidar and chubais and let the berezovskys , fridmans and such to rule and destroy russia . 
  the ignorence of the western business and political leaders paved the way for putin . 
  i guess you know nothing about my country , about our history , about our customs and culture , about the problems and everyday life of my hungarian compatriots at home and abroad . 
  you 're just pushing your agenda and calling my nation disgusting . 
  fuck your mother your miserable sob . 
  [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/howt8gn1iei?t=8s ) is a just released fsb footage about that guy . 
  yes , but to tell the truth making crappy patriotic videos is fun . 
  that 's because the hungarians are just too good to be true . 
  okay , but who will help you to invade europe after we left ? 
  lighten up and never mind . 
  the video was too patriotic for him . 
  here is this year 's [ program ] ( http://www.budapestbylocals.com/event/august-20th/ ) in budapest .

  not so many . 
  there is a mercedes , maybe a cla ( cca . 
  25k euros ) on the third picture , beside that just older sedans and compacts . 
  well , r/europe deserves great titles . 
   replace `` infrastructure '' with whatever is missing from hungary venture capital . 
  we have everything else . 
  ( edit : that means everything from sewers to internet . ), 
  [ `` hungary has an extensive road system , centred in budapest , and the most developed highway network among new eu member states . 
  that is true , but my problem is with the idea of the tomato in the porkolt . 
  it does n't matter if it canned or not . 
   gluten-free at least my dick wo n't fly off . 
   ( thanks for the recipe . ), 
  [ this ] ( http://redd.it/30d6nb ) is how we do it in the developed part of europe . 
  when the shitvolcano is about to erupt you should start to talk about [ immigrants ] ( http://redd.it/3fa09j ) . 
  everybody loves pacal , only some are not ready to admit it . 
  please do n't use the canned tomatoes . 
   we had a thread about this a year ago on r/hungary : https://www.reddit.com/r/hungary/comments/2biw07/authentic_hungarian_goulash_recipe/ the p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt can be incredibly varied . 
  i am a bit purist so i do n't think that you should put bell peppers and tomatoes in a p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt . 
  you can use those to make a good [ lecs\u00f3 ] ( http://www.thehungarydish.com/lecso-recipe-guest-post-by-peter-pawinski/ ) later . 
  so , for a fine beef p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt : * cut up onions really small or grind them down ( like 2 big ones for a kilo of meat ) , roast them on oil or lard until they become glassy . 
  * let the oil/lard and onion mix to cool a bit and then stirring in the paprika , until it melts away . 
  it is important that you should let the oil to cool , as if it 's too hot ( if it 's boiling ) it could burn the paprika and could make it sour . 
  this melting part is the main part of the p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt . 
  * after that you can add the meat and salt , stirring it and heat up again , slowly . 
  if you use beef , ( beef leg is the best ) the salt will extract enough water from the greasy meat , so if you cook it real slow you wo n't need any water . 
  ofc you can add water if you feel that safer or if you cook it the first time , and just boil down the stew in the end . 
  it 's better to add water than to burn the stew . 
  you can add water to pork and chicken , also pork p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt is even tastier if you add some caraway to the onion . 
  this [ video ] ( https://youtu.be/yp2zadsgkee ) could help , it shows how to cook pork p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt with nokedli dumplings . 
  i only learned french in elementary school , but sadly i forgot the most of it . 
  the ren\u00e9 coty gag is not as funny in hungary , but when he said that the french president in the 50s is the friend of the vietnamese , algerians etc. 
  that joke also works here . 
  most of the jokes are working here as well ( about germans , russians , brits , arabs or the americans and israelis ) and ofc this whole french parody edition of james bond is a great idea , that 's a pity it 's not more popular internationally . 
  and ofc french comedy films are popular here since funes , bourvil and fernandel . 
  also hungarians like this kind of humor , even santiago segura was also surprised when he realized that he is a star in hungary because of the torrente movies , which are not really known outside of spain . 
   poland here that was obvious after the kielbasa . 
  in hungary not really . 
  a good spicy and hot goulash , porkolt or fishermen 's soup is good from -40 to +40 c. 
  also we like to eat the cold served fruit soups all year .
