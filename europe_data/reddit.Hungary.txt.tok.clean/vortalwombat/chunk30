  however just read the link about safarov . 
  authoritarian indoctrination ? 
   yes , example : safarov  armenians are assassins . 
  i do n't know what do you want with this . 
  the only explanation is that according to your logic the armenians are all assassins and they all deserve what they get .

  sorry , dude , that is exactly the mentality what i meant . 
  ofc you can always answer with a question and find a medieval anecdotes based chronicle , which also states that we find our first home thanks to a magical deer . 
  hungarians has a rich history and many chronicles with fascinating stories . 
  believe in the hungarian and german colonists and other nationalist myths or zombies and vampires , if you like . 
  `` bulgaria was invaded by the hungarians in ** 894 ** , but a joint counter-attack by the bulgars and the pechenegs -- a nomadic turkic people -- forced the hungarians to find a new homeland in the carpathian basin . 
  ** historians still debate whether they encountered a romanian population in the territory . 
  ** '' '' ... theories on the romanian urheimat or `` homeland '' can be divided into two or more groups , including the theory of daco-roman continuity of the continuous presence of the romanians ' ancestors in the lands north of the lower danube and the opposite immigrationist theory . ( ... ), 
  although for a millennium migratory peoples invaded the lands now forming romania , a sedentary romance-speaking population survived . 
  these lands remained the main `` center of romanization '' after ** the slavs began to assimilate the latin-speaking population of the balkans in the 6th century ** . ( ... 
  ) following the collapse of the empire 's frontiers around 620 , some of this population moved south to regions where latin had not been widely spoken , giving rise to the modern ** vlach shepherds ** . ( ... 
  ) they were first employed as border guards along the southeastern frontiers of the kingdom of hungary and later settled in other sparsely inhabited regions as well . 
  although sheep-breeding remained their principal economic activity for centuries , their ** permanent settlements are also documented from the 1330s .

  calling the hungarians and the germans colonists in transylvania , who conquered the territory when the romanians fought the ottomans ... 
  if you beleive in this , than you are a nationalist idiot , who just does n't care the historical facts , just chauvinist fairy tales . 
  in that case it 's useless to even try to argue with you . 
  in any other cases , you should try to learn some history , english wikipedia is maybe a good starting point , as the hungarian and romanian opinions are largely balancing each other there . 
   amongst the german and hungarian colonists relocated in those parts of the country , whereas the native population had a lower general literacy rate . 
  that 's what happens when you fight and pay tribute to the ottomans for 500 years , only to be conquered by the empire next door which takes away your biggest and most productive chunk of the country , hah , good username . 
  you are really a big fat liar . 
  in my opinion it 's bad , because the hungarian government use it as a decoy . 
  orban fools those who believe his propaganda in hungary and in europe , while he uses his office and power to fuel his mafia network with european money and calling everyone a commie , a liberal or nazi , who tries to stop him . 
  he is a very dangerous man without moral values . 
  the government posted the video on facebook , you can find the embeded video in the article . 
  translation : `` you can hear in the video , that in recent times the border security lock ( that is the fence ) was repeadetly cut , thus illegal migrants were able to cross . 
  if necessary , up to more than six thousand soldiers of the hungarian armed forces can be mobilized within hours to protect the borders - said the former army chief of staff . 
  tibor benko said , that the honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g can do that and it is still able to accomplish its daily tasks ( ... ) . '', 
  the most recent comment on origo : `` not bad as a first attempt , but look at the videos of the korean colleague !, 
  just a few tips : next the nearest soldiers would start with crying `` for orban !, 
  '' , they should fire a few missiles on disabled tanks . 
  oh , yeah , the music is not a bad choice , but next time something more fiery would be better , a march or something . 
  and in the end , at the climax maybe the wise leader would pass in front of some atf policemen . '', 
  i guess you were quite scared for a moment . 
  [ sure ] ( http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/young-man-hangover-holding-beer-bottle-party-studio-portrait-isolated-over-white-background-47140578.jpg ) , but it 's optional .

  keep up the good work .

  9k euros . 
  but they are not the same category .

  `` you can hear the same news here , what we read in our newspapers . 
  both good news and bad news .

  - [ first broadcast ] ( http://valtozomult.blog.hu/2014/11/16/amerika_hangja ) of the voa hungarian broadcast in 1942 . 
  europe still not there . 
  context : lada left hungary years ago , because they were unable to sell their cars ( iirc they sold 3 or 4 cars in their last year ) . 
  now they sold 400 in three months and that is more what the russians anticipated ( cca . 
  5k + / - 10 % new cars sold in a month in hungary , the 2008 crisis hit that business real hard , it 's still recovering . ), 
  we do . 
  duster is a big hit here . 
  if you meant the niva when you wrote down `` shit '' , then you do n't know what are you talking about . 
  sorry dude , i am not a downvoter , but i downvoted your comment . 
  if you want to buy a cheap and good light suv , then the dacia/renault/nissan duster is the best choice , but if you want to buy a real 4x4 , a car which you can use in mud , snow , on places , where dirt roads are a rarity etc. , then the niva is on equal terms with the land rover defender and the mercedes g class for a much lower price . 
  hungary is not even on the map . 
  we are marching with our russian comrades hand in hand toward a bright , illiberal europe , where the government is the nation and opposition is not a thing . 
  they returned to the hungarian market in last december , the [ first sold ] ( http://civilhetes.net/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/kepek/87136_723747_784x523.jpg?itok=it4jiq9w ) car was a lada 4x4 a.k.a. 
  niva and their cheapest car is below 2 million forints ( cca . 
  6500 euro ) . 
  thanks . 
    nagylak is already the romanian side , well , it 's a shame , but til . 
  it seems like i am the average ignorant hungarian from budapest . 
  i knew that nagylak is a border checkpoint towards southeast , but i had serbia in my mind , not arad .
