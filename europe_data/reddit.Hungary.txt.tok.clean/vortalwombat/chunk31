  so , thanks again . 
  8 were detained in november at nagylak , they are awaiting trial in jail . 
  as they are policemen , their case is a military case , so they will get cca . 
  double sentences . 
  ( what is a year for a civilian is usually 2 years for a military person . ), 
  http://vs.hu/kozelet/osszes/a-zahonyiak-utan-a-nagylaki-hatarrendeszek-is-lebuktak-1111#!s0 translation ( i am not a legal translator or a transaltor at all , but i hope it 's understandable ) : `` according to the informations from andrea nagy ( spokeswomen of the central investigation office of the attorney general ) based on the informations provided by the national defense service , the central investigation department of the regional prosecutor 's office started investigations against policemen because of misconduct , acceptance of bribes and willful neglect of duty . 
  prosecutors questioned 11 policemen on tuesday because of acceptance of bribery , while two police officers questioned because of misconduct and house searches were also held . 
  according to the well-founded suspicion the policemen asked for and accepted money , and various small-value gifts from truck drivers on the border . 
  the case is not related to migration . 
  the 11 border guards were arrested by the central investigation office and in 8 cases the pre-trial detention were initiated . 
  the military tribunal of the szeged district court will decide about the detention on wednesday . '', 
  i ca n't find such news with google , but 8 policemen were detained on the ~ ~ serbian ~ ~ romanian * border , at the nagylak border station in november . 
  zahony was closed for hours in october , as all officers working there were arrested . 
  a few of them cooperated with the prosecutors and made a deal , but 20 + were detained out of the 30 + arrested . 
  tbh this is the only sensible use of the term . 
  schengen border is a border where you enter the schengen area . 
  in a similar case hungarian policemen and customs officers were arrested and detained on the ukrainian border in last october , after a lengthy investigation by the secret services and the prosecutors . 
  the officers in zahony ( biggest border station on the ukrainian border ) were aware that they were investigated by the secret services , they spoke about that openly while they were smoking on the outside of the building ( their smoking area was also bugged by the investigators ) , but they did n't stop . 
  the reason ? 
  `` one border protection officer was caught in the act as he took bribes and 950 euros was found in his underwear . '', 
  here is my post from october : https://redd.it/3phbg1 in the last year until november , in hungary 20 + officers were detained on the ukrainian and 10 + on the ~ ~ serbian ~ ~ romanian * border . 
  they are all awating trial in detention . 
  so there are investigations and trials in hungary , but as long an officer can make ~ 1000 euro a better day and he works cca . 
  20 days a month , the temptation is just too big to handle for the most of them . 
  if you encounter corruption in hungary and if you want to , you can lodge a complaint without identification on the webpage of the office of the commissioner for fundamental rights : https://www.ajbh.hu/en/web/ajbh-en/lodge-a-complaint,

  edit : tbh just remembering past sprinkling mondays gives me a minor nausea , but tradition is tradition and also palinka and chocolate eggs . 
  what 's up with the muslims and their obsession with explosives .

  https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/medgyes www.medgyes.ro/node/95 briefing : the settlement 's name comes from the hungarian word for sour cherry , with a possible personal name twist , and today 's spelling standardized in the 19th century . 
  its name was written in various ** charters ** : mediesy in 1267 , in 1283 villa medjes , 1387 medwisch , 1423 maggyes , 1467 medwes , myttuis in 1478-80 , and in 1501 mytuesz mytuesch , 1503 mydwiss , ** 1589 media ** , 1601 metwisch in written form . 
  the german name came from the hungarian , the romanian name came from the german . 
  in the 12th century , a village with a probably a szekler population was situated around the str . 
  its cemetery was excavated under the lutheran church . 
  the szeklers was settled here by saint ladislaus in 1075 and they were sent to the eastern borders ( today 's szeklerland ) by geza ii around the second half of the 12th century . 
  saxons settled there in 1146 according to paul niedermayer , but in 1267 it was already inhabitated by saxons . 
  edit : and it 's based on charters and not on findings and feelings . 
  i do n't think that medias comes from a roman castrum name , as meggyes ( which is the same like medgyes , just with contemporary spelling ) is used in everyday hungarian for a group of sour cherry trees or plantations . 
  ( like `` where were you ? / i was in the ` meggyes ' , we will need to spray the trees in the weekend . '' ), 
  osorhei sounds exactly like vasarhely , just it suits better for the romanian language , that was the reason behind that old name . 
  that is how budakeszi ( sounds like budakessy ) , became wudigess ( sounds like budakess ) or v\u00e1c ( ~ watz ) became watzen in german . 
  ( both places are towns near budapest * ) . 
  my gdp is so big it has it 's own gdp , and my gdp 's gdp is bigger than your gdp . 
  hi , here is a few in hungarian : public media news , hirado.hu : http://www.hirado.hu/2016/03/16/lovoldozes-a-kiskunhalasi-ugyeszsegen/ leading hungarian news site , origo.hu : http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20160316-lovoldozes-kiskunhalas.html i used this report ( on the link * ) from the leading bacs-kiskun county news site , baon.hu : http://www.baon.hu/bacs-kiskun/kek-hirek-bulvar/lovoldozes-a-birosagon-kituntettek-a-hosoket-656365 i hope it 's reliable and relevant enough . 
  yeah it 's like minas morgul = minas ithil . 
   cluj/kolozsv \u00e1r coming from clusiensis = castle surounded ( by walls ) ; medias = medgyes from meggy , means sour cherry in hungarian ; sighisoara = segesv\u00e1r , from ancient hungarian seg ( means hill , it maybe survived in `` segg '' which means ass , but i do n't know ) , means : castle with hills ; targu mures is the translation of marosv\u00e1s\u00e1rhely , means marketplace at the river maros in hungarian , it was called osorhei ( = vasarhely ) in romanian before it became not good enough . 
  that is too many points to answer for me . 
  do you remember monty python 's holy grail , when john cleese stabbed the guard at the castle gate and the other one just said something like `` hey ! '' ? 
  i think that was what happened in kiskunhalas , the situation was just too absurd at first for them . 
  the policemen were * there on a trial , i can imagine that it 's not easy to recognize a gunshot , when you do n't anticipate to hear one . 
  also it would have been useless to shoot him at that point , when the policemen get there . 
  i really do n't like that he had earplugs , for me it indicates that he anticipated some serious shooting . 
  from monday an armed unit will guard the building . 
  about the rants : i read a few in [ baon.hu ] ( http://www.baon.hu/bacs-kiskun/kek-hirek-bulvar/kalasnyikovos-lovesek-kiskunhalason-az-ugyesz-volt-a-celpont-655940 ) 's report and they are not just the regular everybody corrupt and bad and ugly complaints . 
  i do n't think that there are others . 
  according to his lawyer `` it 's easy to buy an assault rifle in hungary '' . 
  well , ** legally ** only shooting clubs can own semi-automatic assault rifles in hungary . 
  you can own legally ( if you have all papers , license etc. , but it 's hard to get one ) only hunting rifles ( max . 
  5 round mag ) , shotguns ( max . 
  3 round mag ) or handguns . 
  every suspect 's face has to be blurred and their family name ca n't be published in hungary ( no one is guilty until proven ) . 
  i suppose his mother allowed to show her picture back in 2012 . 
  with the exception of the public figures ( like mps , politicians , leading civil servants etc. ), 
  if someone ask to blur his/her face in hungary on published photos ( even policemen can do that ) , the publisher has to blur them . 
  if not , then lawsuit etc. 
  and usually the publisher needs to pay a few thousand euros . 
  yes , those 3 ( or 4 , if you count the cooked off one ) rounds were fired only and no one hurt thanks mainly to the porter . 
  i think it 's almost a miracle : the gunman made rants on the facebook before the attack about how he would teach a lesson to the judges and attorneys , he had 240 rounds and earplugs . 
  i think there are cca . 
  50 - 100 people at any time during workhours in a rural judicial building like this ( court and da in the same building ) . 
  oh , horrible , oh , horrible , most horrible !, 
  if thou hast nature in thee , bear it not .

  next year 's bosnian song on eurovision : `` the only one who could ever reach me was ... the hodzic , the only boy who could ever teach me was ... the hodzic , yes he was , he was , ooh , yes he was . '', 
  the video is about the morning protest , the teachers protest was in the afternoon . 
  it 's not organized by a party , but unions . 
  in the morning on the k\u00e1lvin square a thousand i guess , in the afternoon at the teachers demonstration 150k according to the organizers . 
  [ euronews report ] ( https://youtu.be/iagb6a2wezg ) - 2 weeks ago majority of the students in the country stayed at home as part of a common teacher-student demonstration against the government . 
  today they called the pm and the president to apologize to the people , because they tried to intimidate the country . 
  edit : there will be a 1 hour general strike on march 30 . 
  and that 's all i 've got to say about this . 
  thank you and good night . 
  it will continue for a while  anyway based on the behavior of the voters of the jobbik before 2014 and the miep ( previous similar party before 2002 ) those people who vote for extremists or protest parties are tend to lie to the polling companies . 
  with the exception of the party founded companies ( like szazadveg in hungary ) these companies do n't risk manipulation , because they ca n't afford the financial loss , what would happen if their business clients ( like soda or vehicle manufacturers etc. ), 
  figure that out . 
  edit : the same happened in 2002 or in 2006 in hungary . 
  after that the polling companies started to use more indirect questions . 
  they do n't just ask who do you support , but they ask multiple other questions and if someone looks like a duck , swims like a duck , and quacks like a duck , then he is not a liberal democrat . 
  as a hungarian i can tell you what 's next : `` after seeing these results , i would like to sharply criticise the slovakian government and personally pm fico ( who many times fuelled the ethnic tensions with an ongoing campaign against hungary and the romas ) for not having interfered against these extremists more resolutely . '', 
  `` i am deeply concerned about the raging nationalism in slovakia . 
  seriously what 's wrong with the slovaks ? '', 
  `` these kind of extremist organisations in slovakia should also be abolished as they remind everyone to the most sinister era of the slovakian history . '', 
  `` as a citizen of europe i am deeply concerned about the decision of the slovakian voters . 
  also i would like to accusing the slovakian media , because it 's promoting far-right groups , which groups are in fact half-insane neo-fascists and paramilitary organizations . '', 
  `` is it safe to travel to slovakia , now that the neo-nazis are marching up and down the street everywhere ? '',
