  `` now that marian kotleba , the well-known terrorist and a close ally of putin is in the slovakian national council , the eu should suspend slovakia 's voting rights and these results are also a clear danger to nato . '', 
  why just home ? 
  this was a typical gabor kubatov moment from last year , when he called the police to harass the reporters of the nepszabadsag in veszprem : http://youtu.be/duuhuaitwpe edit : also the 380 dna samples from the ftc fans , because they chanted `` our souls are on the stands , your soul is on the death row '' and kubatov felt threatened : http://hooliganstv.com/hundreds-of-dns-analysis-because-of-president-of-ferencvaros/, 
  that 's just because they do n't want recruits . 
  an old [ hungarian ] ( http://youtu.be/alwhdcrhr6m ) one , but it looks suspicious as it 's in english . 
  i guess it was made for pr reasons in the nato to prove that we have an army and not just a mod .

  do you want turul-boners ? 
  because that 's how you get turul-boners . 
  the article is about the nato . 
  why do n't you read it ? 
  you know that is the custom . 
  you read what is on the internet and after that you formulate an opinion about that and after that you make a comment . 
  if you starts it with commenting that 's not an opinion , but an agenda . 
  he does n't care the subject , just saw `` russia '' in the title and started to write comments . 
  no problem , we will bring back latin into everyday use . 
  ok , my bad . 
  eastern european as an eastern european country which is a member of the nato . 
  also the article is not about an imminent invasion , but a possible reaction of the nato to an invasion . 
  that 's not the same . 
  based on what i know about their [ government ] ( https://i.imgflip.com/zm88g.jpg ) , i am not surprised . 
  not they , we . 
  welcome to the family , luci . 
  [  ] ( https://youtu.be/7af4egj3vy0 ), 
  2006 , a year of calamities like the [ the bloodbath in dortmund ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_fifa_world_cup_knockout_stage#germany_vs_italy ) and [ the clash of berlin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_fifa_world_cup_knockout_stage#final ) . 
  the author of this article in the national interest [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_national_interest ) is robert farley , a senior lecturer at the patterson school of diplomacy and international commerce at the university of kentucky . 
  he gives an insight to the nato 's possible behavior in a war against russia . 
  `` in short , the nato deterrent promise has never revolved around a commitment to defeat soviet/russian forces on nato 's borders . '', 
  '' ... russia could grab the baltics , but only at a cost vastly in excess of the value of holding onto them . 
  this is how nato conducted deterrence in 1949 , and it 's how nato does deterrence today . '', 
  '' ... the threat that france , britain and the united states would launch strategic nuclear strikes on the soviet union in response to a successful conventional assault was supposed to give moscow pause . 
  even if an american president refused to exchange berlin for new york , the soviets would have to worry about the rest of nato 's nuclear deterrent . '', 
  i am glad you liked it , it was a very interesting era . 
  no , you 're right . 
  romania had serious meat shortages under ceausescu , that is why the wiener schnitzel is calm in the joke . 
  it was allowed but with restrictions . 
  the connection between ceausescu and kadar was very bad . 
  not as bad as between khrushchev and mao or stalin and tito , but they had great differencies and they had totally different ideas about socialism , communism . 
  they were also two totally different characters , and i think their end clearly showed that . 
  the flamboyant ceausescu and his wife were executed , while more than 100k people attended to the [ funeral ] ( http://mult-kor.hu/image/article/main/.630x1260/25308.jpg ) of the modest kadar in 1989 , when the communist party was very unpopular in hungary and the communism was collapsed . 
  k\u00e1d\u00e1r still viewed today by cca . 
  50 % of the hungarians as a positive historical figure and many of them accepts kadar 's description about himself : `` i was where i had to be , i did what i had to do . '', 
  for example it 's really hard to find a negative joke about kadar , most of them are positive jokes , where the good guy kadar prevails somehow . 
  ceausescu was a neo-stalinist and a nationalist , while kadar was jailed for years before 1956 under a stalinist leadership and was more liberal and a pro-soviet internationalist . 
  kadar tried to avoid an uprising by giving more freedom for the people , while ceasusescu built up a north korea in europe . 
  also ceausescu did n't trust in hungary , because of the [ goulash communism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goulash_communism ) , hungarian minorities in romania , trianon etc. 
  after 1958 ( when the soviet troops left romania and hungary was under de facto soviet military occupation ) kadar tried to improve the relations between the two countries on the basis of the socialist internationalism but the romanians was n't interested in that , they were more interested in topics like the opression of the `` nationalist '' hungarian minorities , romanian nationalists or any opposition in romania , finding new romanian ways for the socialism etc. 
  against a weakened hungary ( after the revolution hungarian diplomatic relations with the west was destroyed and the eastern bloc did n't trust in hungary ) they tried to negotiate from a power position , and that did n't work . 
  the situation did n't changed in the next decades ; hungary became more and more liberal , romania became more and more stalinist . 
  ceausescu did n't want to negotiate about any of the subjects important to hungary ( improving political , cultural , economical relations , the hungarian minority , soviet relations ) . 
  on their last meeting in 1977 , kadar did n't want to sleep * in the same building as ceausescu . 
  tldr : they really did n't like each other , so kadar and the [ mszmp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_socialist_workers%27_party ) did n't mind if someone spoke badly about ceausescu until it did n't harm the socialist bloc , the socialism , the warsaw pact etc. 
  it 's like [ masaryk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tom%c3%a1%c5%a1_garrigue_masaryk ) in hungary as `` ma szarik '' pronounced just the same and it means `` shits today '' . 
  in the joke masaryk visits budapest and step on a guy 's toes on the tram . 
  `` watch out you old fool ! '', 
  `` pardon me sir , but i am masaryk . '', 
  `` i do n't care if you `` ma saryk '' ( shit today ) or `` holnap saryk '' ( shit tomorrow ) , but if you step on my toes again i will punch you so hard , that you will `` beh saryk '' ( shit yourself ) . '', 
  elena was well known in hungary , the deeds of the ceausescus was even a basis for a hungarian movie in the 80s , the titania , titania ( plot : the dictator is dying and his three stand-ins know that they have to die , so they try to escape ) . 
  in this [ scene ] ( https://youtu.be/afuejldtytc ) ( unfortunately no english or romanian source ) the dictator of titania and his wife angelica prepare grass-soup for the titan people , because it 's much healthier than meat and it grows from the ancient titan land etc. 
  [ full movie ] ( https://youtu.be/pfhkimoqeho ), 
  then here 's a last one ; ceausescu dies and for all his sins he ends up in hell . 
  a few weeks later someone knocking on the heavens door , st.peter goes out to find out who is that . 
  he finds three * ugly devils there . 
  `` what do you want here ? '', 
  `` asylum . '', 
  it 's good . 
  papa also have the same meanings in hungarian . 
  there was a wide disgust in hungary towards ceausescu 's system , and not because of his nationality , but because of the way he treated his country , so no offense intended , but from the ceausescu times there was a ( sad ) joke in hungary about romania : the apple takes a walk on the street , when he meets the tomato , who is very upset and in a hurry . 
  `` what 's the problem , tomato ? '', 
  asks the apple . 
  `` run you fool ! '', 
  shouts the tomato `` here comes the romanians and they will eat us all ! '', 
  they starts to run down the street and they meet with the bell pepper . 
  `` run , bell pepper , run !, 
  here comes the romanians and they will eat you ! '', 
  they continue to run and after a few hundred meters they meet with the wiener schnitzel . 
  `` run , wiener schnitzel , you fool , run !, 
  here comes the romanians and they will eat you ! '', 
  `` why would they do that ? 
  they do n't even know me ! '', 
  and another ceausescu classic ; the us president , the pope and ceausescu travel on a plane and the pilot comes in and tell them that there is a major problem with the plane and they will crash in minutes , but there is only 3 parachutes on the plane . 
  the us president stands up and says : `` i am the leader of the free world , i have to survive ! '', 
  and he jumps out the plane . 
  within seconds ceausescu proclaims , that : `` i am the genius of the carpathians , i have to survive for romania ! '', 
  and he grabs a parachute and jumps out the plane . 
  the pope looks at the pilot and says : `` jump my boy , i 'll be just fine . '', 
  `` no need to do that holy father , the genius jumped with the sleeping bag . '', 
  our parents in return smuggled those electrical cooking pots when they returned from skiing . 
   anyway i once read a report about a hungarian family who decided to emigrate officially to czechoslovakia in the 1970s , because they loved prague and they wanted to live there . 
  it took years to them to obtain all papers , despite the fact that we were two brotherly socialist countries , because the hungarian authorities tried to explain them how much better to live in hungary . 
  it turned out that it was almost easier to left to a western country than to a socialist one . 
  in hungary it was more relaxed after the 50s . 
  if you did n't ask questions or express bad opinions about 4 things ; the leadership of the mszmp ( the hungarian communist party ) , the presence of the soviet troops in the country , the nature of 1956 ( they considered it a counter-revolution and if you called it uprising or revolution that was really bad ) and the primacy of the communal ownership over private ownership in the economy , you did n't get into real trouble . 
  geza hofi , a well known comedian of the era had a famous joke in the 70s about the shortcomings of the economy : `` when do your kid has new shoes on his feet ? 
  when the son of the mayor step on it . '', 
  his other classic was , and it 's still relevant : `` i drove my car around gy\u0151r and it was like tadaam , tadaam , tadaam , tadaam and suddenly just silence . 
  shit , i crossed the border to austria . '', 
  comrade cohen stands up on a party meeting and makes a very good speech about the shortcomings of the socialist system in the country and asks several important and fascinating questions about economical matters . 
  on the next party meeting comrade braun stands up and says : `` comrade cohen asked some very important and fascinating questions on our last meeting considering the state of our economy and the shortcomings of the socialist system in our country . 
  i have only one question left ; where is comrade cohen ? '',
