  considering that this is r/europe and it 's obviously a local news , as it happened in vienna and it 's old , because it happened the last year , it 's strange that the mods did not removed this post and blew up the server which stored it and send a hardened ( phrasing - boom ) team of mujahedins after the op hours ago . 
  thanks , til . 
  it 's really a fun fact . 
  it 's indeed confusing : https://youtu.be/yzph3zrlsem vs https://youtu.be/hg45-tfarcu, 
  that 's a pity . 
  what is better , if i understand this correctly , this time it wo n't be protection , but a military aid , that possibly means new fighters ( f16 vs mig21 ) for romania , new tanks ( m1a1 vs t72 ) for hungary etc. 
  edit : anyway i have no problem with kissy-kissy , just it 's good to prepare for the worst .

  sorry people , but every military exercise is a simulated armed conflict , offensive or defensive , but it simulates an armed conflict . 
  that is the reason behind a military exercise . 
  this is what happens everywhere in europe . 
  voters are more concerned with their safety than their rights and they are ready to give up some of their freedom in exchange for ( both actual and economic ) safety . 
  this is not a new thing , this is how napoleon became first consul . 
  but it has a gift ribbon on it . 
  it is , but an absurd and funny one . 
  it does n't take itself too seriously . 
  well , this is a war on terror , and after all , it 's just a war like any other war . 
  i know it is considered one of the best , only i ca n't watch it . 
  you can counter if you want to , i do n't say that we should do that , i only say that this is what happens usually . 
  when the `` liberalism '' of the commonwealth and the dutch ended ( by a foreign power ) , there were anti-jewish pogroms on the former territories of the commonwealth and only 35k dutch jews survived the holocaust . 
  again , do n't get me wrong , we should n't do that , but it keeps happening without liberalism and human rights . 
  in my opinion , a minority , like the muslims in europe have to accept this and behave accordingly . 
  \u00c1lom.net ( [ youtube ] ( https://youtu.be/_tfhrfnazsu ) ) is bad , but not that bad . 
  i think we have worse movies than that . 
  like [ satantango ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111341/ ) is a widely acclaimed movie , but i just ca n't watch it ( 450min - honestly if 90/120 min is not enough , you need to cut ) . 
  that is a great movie and i still waiting for the gay werewolf sequel . 
   and then what ? 
  we start burning them at the stake ? 
  arrest them for having a different world view ? 
  i know it 's hard to believe , because liberalism and progressivism have created a world in the eu in which people living in a pc bubble since 1945 , but usually if a sizeable minority exists in a country , even if it accepts and follows the rules of the majority population that is what happens eventually . 
  when the minority ca n't accept the rules and customs of the majority it happens faster . 
  jews and moors vs. spanish , tutsi and hutu , the nazis , it 's all the same . 
  only the so called `` liberal '' values can defend a minority , and the muslims just sawing off the branch they are sitting on . 
  71 years ago there were many camps in europe although most of the muslims deny that . 
  it can happen again . 
  i did that . 
   it 's not that bad as it 's easier to grow for india than for germany i suppose .

  sit in an incompetent driver 's car as a passenger could have direct and dire effects on the person 's life . 
  that is why taxi drivers need to pass medical tests , psychological tests etc. 
  ( and need to have insurance ) *, 
   why are you assuming ... 
  i assuming it because the uber driver avoid to pay the starting fees , which a taxi driver have to pay . 
  he ( and his vehicle ) needs to pass a special exam , his vehicle needs to be modified , he need to be self-employed or employed by a company etc. 
  taxi drivers ca n't avoid taxation totally . 
  uber drivers easily can . 
   so , according to you ... 
  i did n't say that . 
  maybe they should , but those regulations ensured a better quality service for the customer . 
  it 's not a problem if you use someone else car , if it 's free or that guy pays taxes . 
  why it is important ? 
  paying your taxes is considered a civic duty , although doing so is also a requirement of the law.the money you pay in taxes goes many , many places . 
  in addition to paying the salaries of government workers , your tax dollars also help to support common resources , such as police firefighters and hospitals . 
  tax money also helps to ensure the roads you travel on are safe and well-maintained . 
  taxes are also used to fund many types of government programs that help the poor and less fortunate , as well as many schools . 
  yes , it 's about the children . 
  then you should find yourself a doctor or a lawyer who is not part of the current monopolistic establishment and give you a much better service at a fair price . 
  those pathetic people payed a good money to modify their cars , to get the necessary papers and documents and licenses for themselves and their cars and in budapest they have to follow a fare table . 
  and they pay taxes for the central and local government . 
  really pathetic .

   does the old name for romania come from one of its constituent part , wallachia ? 
  it 's rather come from the old name of the romanians ( vlach ) . 
  the old hungarian name for wallachia was `` havaselve '' ( meaning the territory before the snowy mountains ) and `` havasalf\u00f6ld '' ( snowy lowland ) . 
  plural form of the word `` havas '' ( snowy ) , still used in the names of the carpathian mountains in transylvania , like `` fogarasi-havasok '' ( snowies of fogaras - masivul f\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219ului - fogaras mountains ) and it means snowy ( mountains of ) fogaras . 
  hungarians like croatians , but for the most of them croatia means dalmatia , because that is their holiday destination . 
  so no offense intended , just everything between hungary and the adriatic sea is croatia for the most of us . 
  the graffitis were russians i think , because the russian tourists loved that part of the country ( heviz and balaton ) until the ukrainian war and sanctions . 
  the hungarian statehood is continuous from 1000 or 1001 ( the coronation of st. stephen ) . 
  after 1526 , even under the habsburgs the kingdom of hungary ( the lands of the holy crown ) was a separate country with its own national assembly , government , court system , laws and customs . 
  so the hungarian tribes conquered the carpathian basin in 896 and the hungarian state is 1015 years old . 
  afaik the term was used until the 19th century in public law for slavonia indeed . 
  olasz is indeed from vlas and it 's from the croats , the original hungarian word for italians was `` talian '' and for italy `` talianorsz\u00e1g '' ( taliancountry ) . 
  we call serbia , romania and slovakia on these names because that is what these nations prefer . 
  the outdated names ( used before the 19th century ) are `` r\u00e1corsz\u00e1g '' ( rasciancountry for serbia ) `` ol\u00e1horsz\u00e1g '' ( vlachcountry - romania ) and `` t\u00f3torsz\u00e1g '' ( t\u00f3tcountry - slovakia ) or simply `` felvid\u00e9k '' ( uppercountry ) .

  `` the prosperity index offers a unique insight into how prosperity is forming and changing across the world . 
  traditionally , a nation 's prosperity has been based solely on macroeconomic indicators such as a country 's income , represented either by gdp or by average income per person ( gdp per capita ) . 
  however , most people would agree that prosperity is more than just the accumulation of material wealth . 
  it is also the joy of everyday life and the prospect of being able to build an even better life in the future . 
  the index is distinctive in that it is the only global measurement of prosperity based on both income and wellbeing . 
  in recent years , governments , academics , international organisations , and businesses have increasingly moved their attention towards indicators that measure wellbeing as a complement to gdp . '',

  original text of the selfpost : `` i know that ethiopia is not in europe , but as our greatest challenge in the eu was the migrant crisis in 2015 , i think that we should be aware that one of the last [ `` key stabiliser in the region '' ] ( http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/african-refugees_swiss-support-ethiopia-s-role-in-migration-crisis/41741280 ) ( the horn of africa ) is in the danger of a crisis . 
  ethiopia is the second most populated country in africa next to nigeria , with a majority christian and minority muslim population who have peacefully coexisted for centuries . 
  ethiopia is located in a region where political instability , civil strife and interstate conflict have been defining features over the last few decades . 
  as a close ally of the us and the west in the fight against terrorism with its unrivalled demographic weight and strong military influence in the region it could help or hinder the spread of radical islam across the belt of africa . 
  also it has 280,621 refugees and asylum-seekers only [ from south sudan ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/southsudan/country.php?id=65 ) and in total more than 630,000 refugees are accommodated , mainly in camps , throughout the country .

  and the good news is that we have every chance of success . 
  by investing now , we can safeguard three decades of development and billions of dollars of assistance that have helped ethiopia to become one of the most successful economies on the african continent . 
  un agencies , the red cross and red crescent movements , and international and local charities are on standby to increase their help . 
  all they need is reliable funding .
