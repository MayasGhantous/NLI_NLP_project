  ( ... ) so far , donors have provided an additional us$ 200 million in aid , but there are early indications that the amount needed to make sure lives are not lost could be around $ 1 billion . 
  ethiopia needs that money now , if we are to avert a second tragedy in 30 years . '', 
  that means cca . 
  $ 1 billion is needed to guarantee the stability `` in a country that already hosts the largest refugee population in africa , '' and where `` many are concerned that the looming crisis could lead people , particularly farmers , to move in search of food , water and pasture . '', 
  i hope the european nations and the eu this time will be wise enough to stop this crisis in its tracks by supporting ethiopia in time and they will not allow a new wave of migrants to reach our continent . '', 
  that 's good , but no one should crack a bottle of champagne on ganja !, 
  this is the business of the century . 
  only 10 refugees ( $ 3500 gross per month + work ) can help you to renovate the house in a few months . 
  when they want to leave just tell them that they 're family now . 
  i promise we will try to make an agreement on this subject with jobbik and hvim on our next meeting . 
  i am not biased , i am just waiting for the right moment to crack my joke about n\u00fameromanians . 
   the romanian resistance against the oppressive austro-hungarian empire in transilvania romanian historians second only to tolkien in these kind of stuff . 
  no , it 's just a small plantation . 
  i have a nice farm in the countryside in eastern europe . 
  i can host many . 
  no land like poland . 
  it starts with budapest . 
  damn , now i really want to invest in the eu . 
  no problem , it 's a good gallery and bu\u00c9k !, 
  soviets executed 400k hungarians in 1956 ? 
  you should edit that , as it is simply not true . 
  i do n't see any reasons for this as the reality is bad enough , no need to do this . 
  3000 hungarians died during the fight incl . 
  non combatants , 13k wia incl . 
  non combatants and 229 people executed after the revolution . 
  battlefield stress . 
  poor fella . 
  if you are upset about your car being torched , you ca n't afford that car .

  the 63-year-old laszlo b\u00f6de ate octopus at christmas eve and even swam in the 18 degrees celsius aegean sea .

  the man from szeged encamped on the island of naxos in october 2014 , next to the small village of agia anna . 
  ` after seven months , i went home to szeged in late april , but i wanted to return here after a month . 
  since the first of september i live here again ' - said the former locomotive engineer who became disabled at the age of 37 , and had been repeatedly operated on his spine . 
  he added to his retirement income from odd jobs , he was a fashion-salesman , paperboy , [ langos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%a1ngos ) - maker , hotel receptionist , security guard and market seller .

  ' i buy everything with my card in the supermarkets just like in szeged . 
  here , however , i can spend more because there are no overhead expenses . 
  i use of water from the water system of the village , from the shower near the coast . 
  the electricity is from the solar panels which i brought here , i cook myself a dinner every day , the firewood is free and unlimited ' - told us the pensioner who go to naxos city for shopping once a week by bike . 
  ' i spend ninety percent of my money on what i eat , ten per cent on the necessary replacement clothes and other small items . 
  every other day i buy a half-kilo of bread in the village store . 
  i spend an average of $ 120 per month , as it had to cover the flight to and from home . 
  during my seven months long stay in greece i gathered enough money for a trip to paris and rome on low-cost flights and i took home enough reserve to hire an apartment in szeged immediately after i got home ' - said the 63-year-old man . 
  ' i wanted to go home for christmas , but i could n't . 
  but i will go home in early february and i want to come back again to naxos in late april , when the air tickets are the cheapest . ', 
  - said laszlo , who spent the last christmas there . 
  last year , on december 24 there was 24 degrees celsius , this year it was 22 degrees on naxos . 
  at christmas , he swam in the 18 degrees sea , which does not allow to cool down the coastal strip where the pensioner set up his tent , which according to him is not cold at night , only the air is sometimes a bit fresh . 
  ' i have a sleeping bag , but i have never slept in it , just used it as a blanket . ', 
  - he said . 
  how does his day look like ? 
  first , he sleeps 8-9 hours , his earlier sleeping problems were gone . 
  in the morning he takes long walks , then cooks something . 
  a siesta after lunch , and in the early evening he sit in the only tavern of the village , where there is wi-fi , he go online a little to keep in touch with the folks at home . 
  ** 800 euros is the average in greece ** l\u00e1szl\u00f3 b\u00f6de learned from the locals that the greek minimum pension is around $ 500 . 
  the average pension is nearly $ 800 in greece . 
  ` it is hard to believe for them that my pension is 200 euros . 
  they live well , go to restaurants frequently , they celebrate everything and almost everyone has a car . 
  but to tell the truth they do not dress in the latest fashion . 
  here , the priorities are not similar ' - said the pensioner from szeged . 
  ** instead of tripe stew ; fried octopus ** ` what do you miss from szeged ? ', 
  ` sometimes i think about how nice it would be to take a walk on the [ k\u00e1r\u00e1sz ] ( http://magazin.belfoldipihenes.hu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/szegedi_karasz_utca.jpg ) . 
  i am missing a couple of people who i love . 
  but i do n't miss the hungarian atmosphere , the bowed heads , the grumpy people . 
  i miss a good tripe stew ' - he said . 
  a pensioner has been repeatedly caught octopus with artifical lures . 
  ' i looked up on the net , how to prepare it . 
  you must first slap it to a rock , then cook for a couple of hours , then roast in olive oil with garlic . 
  delicious . ' '', 
  it 's on the main public tv channel right now . 
  it 's good if you do n't have a hangover . 
  it 's like a linguistic lego . 
  you do n't need to learn this for every word , as these are suffixes and you just throw them after the word according to your needs . 
  also the hungarian language loves to simplify things , it lost 5 + tenses over the years . 
  `` after all , a politically and economically successful ukraine would be a defeat for putin 's policies and could endanger his position of power at home . '', 
  - it 's not putin 's fault what happened in ukraine since the 1990s . 
  ukraine was n't politically and economically successful even before the war , that was the reason behind the maidan . 
  it was a divided country ( [ election map ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-egcoelp3kxe/uxs2l_hsygi/aaaaaaaabwg/iy3kvscn1py/s1600/ukraine_election_map_yanukovich_tymoshenko.png ) ) ran by oligarchs . 
  '' ( ukrainian ) soldiers admit their desire to take back their lost territory in the east but are constrained by political considerations at the present time . '', 
  `` with the specter of open fistfights in the ukrainian parliament '' - that 's not new , they do n't need the russians for that . 
  well , we 're screwed enough ... 
  ** tldr : ** hung parliament = screwed spain . 
  [ bro\u00e1f ] ( http://m.cdn.blog.hu/hi/hircsarda/image/201307/201307-broaf.jpg ), 
  maybe it 's because war was the barbarian invaders ' business after the fall of rome and even before that roman army was not recruited from the local rural population .

  so they wo n't work because they are black . 
  racist . 
  mmsz ... ga\u00e1l no\u00e9mi knew it before them . 
  i ca n't really recall the reasons ( because i heard the info from this [ weatherwomen ] ( http://www.ize.hu/_files/pics/00012/00012129.jpg ) ) , but in hungary the tv already told us in november , that there will be such warm weather until the new year . 
  iirc it 's because an anticyclone over the british isles .

  i think you forgot to mention serbia .
