  the hungarian police force will work under slovenian leadership . 
  the hungarian police officers will serve at reception centers , will participate in border guard duties , in the so-called in-depth inspection and will perform public law enforcement tasks . 
  k\u00e1roly papp also said that this year the most challenging tasks for the police were the tasks concerning illegal immigration and border protection . 
  he recalled that hungary , in order to comply with the schengen borders code adopted measures standing on three pillars in the middle of the year : regulatory environment on illegal immigration became more stringent , technical barriers were installed on the affected borders and a new border police directorate was set up . 
  as a result of these measures the migration across the border is almost eliminated , today the entry of passengers and vehicles happens on border stations under regulated conditions . 
  slovenia has requested assistance in late october to perform police duties , hungary was among the first to respond to this request , and according to the decision of the government , sent a police force there between november 9 2015 and 31 january 2016 . '', 
  oh , his face after the shoe incident , the tap dance in front of the white house , the wrong door in china etc. 
  great ententainer , obama is boring compared to him . 
  charge a hungarian for a service after he got it ? 
  good luck with that . 
  i should n't support any of them as i am not a us citizen , and that 's not my business , but : - i do n't like trump , because he looks like a populist , - i do n't like sanders because he thinks that scandinavia is a socialist utopia , - i do n't like clinton , because of [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/fgcd1ghag5y ) . 
  gaddafi was not a great guy , but that is simply a disgusting behaviour , and her reaction on his death tells a lot about hillary clinton . 
  bring back bush , he was your most entertaining president . 
  you mean cheap journalism ? 
  `` the pope did not specifically mention the marriage law or the vote , but he told them he encourages ` everyone , especially those with public responsibility , to support the family , a structural reference point for the life of society , ' agence france-presse reports . '', 
  - just used the word family and did not say anything about the composition of the family . 
  `` opponents of the law , led by a catholic-backed group called children are at stake '' - if that group is really backed by the catholics , the catholic church is not an army , and the pope is not a dictator of the church . 
  a fine example of how to get some cheap popularity with anti-catholicism . 
  throwing a pile of shit together , without any evidence but with a nice misleading title . 
  what an article . 
  it 's baltic air policing , and it 's based on a schedule . 
  iirc raf take over lithuania * , hungarians will return for a second deployment in 2019 according to the hungarian president who brought some beigli for the hungarian soldiers in lithuania last week ( and a cross for the lithuanians - [ video ] ( http://youtu.be/rwrlp3tttkm ) ),

  this time american soldiers also involved in the work of the traditional romanian-hungarian military exercise called wise foresight . 
  after a forced river crossing , the fictional enemy launched an attack against the friendly allied forces . 
  the nato troops first stopped the attack in a defensive battle . 
  the enemy withdrew after the nato troops flanked the enemy and delivered a decisive blow during their counter attack . 
  lt. general dr. zoltan orosz , deputy chief of the hungarian home defence staff thanked the soldiers for their steadfastness and professional competence in his closing speech on the end of the vip day 's exercise , which was combined by a live fire exercise . 
  he said that the romanian-hungarian cooperation in joint training has been unbroken for twenty years and both sides are committed to the joint peacekeeping effort . 
  he stressed , that this year they had to adapt to the new challenges due to the changes in the security environment , and therefore part of the exercise focused on the professional tactics of combating hybrid warfare . 
  as a part of the operation atlantic resolve , a large-scale series of military exercises , 120 us soldiers took part in the exercise . 
  they prepared for this exercise in [ tata ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tata,_hungary ) since fall . 
  us a-10 attack aircrafts , participating in thunderbolt 2015 joint training in hungary also involved in the last days of the exercise , however , they were not able to take off on the vip day because of poor visibility conditions .

  ode to joy is the anthem of europe as a whole . 
  '' ` ode to joy ' is the anthem of the european union and the council of europe ; both of which refer to it as the european anthem due to the council 's intention that , as a semi-modern composition with a mythological flair , it does represent europe as a whole , rather than any organisation . '', 
  - [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anthem_of_europe ) council of europe : 47 member states ; eu : 28 member states . 
  also most of them has democratically elected government . 
  it does n't mean anything in hungarian . 
  csal\u00f3s ( tchalohsch ) would be hungarian , meaning `` one who is a trickster '' and based on wikipedia his family is from szilagy/salaj county so who knows ? 
  never heard of it . 
  imho ketchup is the hungarian way for fries/chips and sour creme/onion for chips/crisps . 
  it 's okay , he is just our legacy protector guy . 
  not an easy job tbh . 
  fixed it . 
  germany is the popular kid of europe . 
   edit : about the discussion ; i answered the `` internal rhetoric '' part and the fact , that `` romania is catching up with hungary '' is rather frequent topic on r/europe between romanian redditors ( just look at this thread ) . 
  really , you should aim higher . 
   you on the other side also have slovakia and austria ... no need to cry . 
   slovakia is the same as you , that means just the minority is interesting for the hungarian media and under normal circumstances just for short colorful news . 
  and honestly i can name fico as a slovak pm , but i ca n't name the austrian pm without a google search . 
  to tell the truth even the hype before hungarian - romanian soccer matches is mostly artifically created by the media , so you are not considered `` evil '' , just `` what 's wrong with them '' and only in the case of a conflict . 
  * germany ( meaning bavaria ) and the uk ( meaning england ) are the real reference points in hungary . 
  an average hungarian knows more about merkel and cameron than about fico or ~ ~ ponta ~ ~ ciolos . 
  there is a guy like orban in it . 
  long story short : i think you should n't believe orban , because he is a natural born manipulator without true principles or long term strategies . 
  have you ever read mario and the magician ? 
   we are the baddies ... romania is not a topic in hungary , only the hungarian minorities . 
  ( news about csaba bojte and such ) it 's still impress me that hungary is seemingly a reference point for the romanians . 
  the dna became a topic here recently as an example how to fight against corruption , but not in the state owned or pro-government media , only in the leftist atv etc. 
  somehow the whole hungarian media ( left , right ) managed to ignore the whole romanian anti-corruption fight , i think they ( and their masters ) are afraid of the example . 
  italy , because it 's italy ? 
  that is disturbing and can lead to a zombie apocalypse . 
  eight is enough . 
  and hungary is in the nato southern command just to increase confusion . 
  yes that is one version , but if you put mohn/nus etc in the dough and roll it up , it become mohn/nusstriezel . 
  strudel is more lighter and crispier than the [ bejgli ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/bejgli1.jpg ) , we call the strudel [ r\u00e9tes ] ( http://www.reteshaz-god.hu/images/foto_galeria/konyakmeggyes_makos_retes.jpg ) . 
  it matters as it is not a made up pc category , but a political and historical fact . 
  [ the three historical regions of europe : an outline ] ( http://www.jstor.org/stable/42555425?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents ) by jeno szucs proved the thesis , that the central european region differs from both western and eastern europe , politically and historically . 
  strudel is good ( but you have to wait for the cream ) , but this is rather a mohnstriezel . 
  this landlocked country even has a [ fleet ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/images/hu-flottilla.jpg ) .

   they supposedly leave turkey because the conditions are absolute shit there for them . 
  nope . 
  they leave turkey because they want to live in europe . 
  they want to live the european dream ( big apartment , big tv , big kebab etc. ) .

  thanks . 
  in case of a paywall see ... elvishcopter 's comment . 
  sorry , i understood as we double you up , my fault . 
   do you honestly not believe the official reports ? 
  i believe that the hvim is stupid and sinister enough to cause harm to hungary , like in 2006 , when they helped to escalate the situation during the protests . 
  toroczkai , zagyva and alikes are dangerous people . 
  maybe their affiliates are strong enough to cause unrest in romania , i do n't know that , as i am not living there and i am not from there . 
  in this case 1000 people protest for this beke in his hometown . 
  the same people who were his targets according to the authorities . 
  this is the part of this case which is not okay for me . 
  arresting a hungarian extremist on the biggest national holiday of romania in a predominantly hungarian town for plotting a terrorist attack with a secessionist goal is just to good to be true . 
  after the recent turmoil in romania it 's just a proper message from the state security services to the public . 
  i would wait for the decision of the romanian court , but until that it 's hard to believe for me . 
  i tried not to push my opinion ( just look at my first comment ) , i just posted this link , because the stance of this article is the typical stance of the hungarian-language press in romania ( not in hungary ) and if you want to find a problem , i think this is one as this means that many of the hungarians ( or their opinion leaders ) in transylvania does n't believe to the authorities . 
  and this is a serious problem , which you ca n't fix with the usual `` stupid hungarians ca n't fit * in '' answer .
