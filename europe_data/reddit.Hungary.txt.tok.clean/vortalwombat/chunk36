   double our size in territory and population . 
   just op probably . 
  because he ca n't stand the truth that some hungarian extremists might employ terrorist tactics , although every single piece of evidence and every official authority points to this fact . 
  i posted a link about a protest , which you do n't like and i am support extremists and i am a butthurt hungarian etc. 
  someone downvoted you and it 's must be me as i am lurking around this thread all day long . 
  your commitment to this thread is second to none ; 9 comments out of 24 . 
  you should take a break , dude . 
  anyway thank you for sharing your vision and for taking the initiative in the war on ethnic hungarian terrorism on reddit . 
  about the city : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%c3%a2rgu_secuiesc about the case : http://www.agerpres.ro/english/2015/12/02/terror-plot-suspect-beke-istvan-is-remanded-in-custody-10-22-04, 
  two thousand years ago , the proudest boast was civis romanus sum ( `` i am a roman citizen '' ) . 
  today , in the world of freedom , the proudest boast is `` olen suomalainen ! '' ... 
  all free men , wherever they may live , are citizens of suomi , and therefore , as a free man , i take pride in the words `` olen suomalainen !, 
   a multinational german-owned corporation ... 
  they are multinational but not saint . 
  mcdonalds covered up a case in budapest 5 months ago , when blacks were expelled from a restaurant : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dernc/expelling_blacks_from_mcdonalds_local_boss/ multinational companies are not about just pure economics either . 
  ofc most of the time and in discrimination issues they are better than local small businesses , but they are still organizations run by people . 
  allegedly tried to blow up . 
  i heard that there is a protest every afternoon at 4pm in kezdivasarhely for the guy , yesterday with 1000 people . 
  maybe the locals ( those who he wanted to blow up allegedly ) are n't convinced . 
  love the `` storms of the 20th century '' in the last sentence . 
  pet\u0151fi 2 : https://youtu.be/ganrpcta7uy, 
  nah , i like your previous answer and definition better . 
  it answered the question well . 
  ( but i wo n't edit the translate again , as one can easily understand what happened from it ), 
  there is the wikipedia link in my first answer . 
  feel free to click on it . 
  dude . 
  there is a photo about people with three flags in ski masks in a forest . 
  according to you they are hungarian terrorists . 
  i bet you are not the brightest one of your people . 
  and hungarian terrorism ? 
  really ? 
  read the title again . 
  `` allegedly '' . 
  nobody blown up any celebrations . 
  what is the purpose of the original link ? 
  i wanted to show that the original photo is also bullshit and my point is that it 's just pure fear mongering and disinformation to post the original link about the alleged hungarian fighters in eastern ukraine . 
  well you asked what are they fighting for . 
  they are not fighting , they are not like ira , much more like a group of extreme far right football hooligans . 
  austro-hungarian-gipsy [ cimbalom ] ( http://youtu.be/zsv5cvhoesa ) !, 
  shit . 
  i have to warn the other hungarians that we are after the wrong guy . 
  double touche . 
  me too , but it 's too easy for them to spread it . 
  never doubt . 
  we are . 
  only it 's not against romania . 
  it 's against ~ ~ u/purculesul ~ ~ u/purcelusul . 
  and the hungarian photo is not ? 
  i doubt that you can name a single terror attack backed by hungarians anywhere in the neighbouring states since the treaty of trianon , while cca . 
  3.5 million ( and the number was 5 million first ) hungarians live in those countries . 
  your war on terror stance looks a bit comical to me . 
  it 's not `` fighting '' for anything . 
  they are far right extremists , but not terrorists .

   magyarbros , pls do n't do this . 
  t_t do n't worry , terrorism is not the hungarian way . 
  we are the invader/liberator kind of folks , with tanks and white horses . 
  and speeches . 
  we love speeches . 
   i think we 've been decent stewards of transylvania . 
  `` steward - a person who manages another 's property '' [ source ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/steward ) :d happy national holiday !, 
  when i posted the russian claims it was removed for low quality , because my source was `` an american conspiracy outlet '' . 
  [ 1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3uuqlu/meet_the_man_who_funds_isis_bilal_erdogan_the_son/ ) it 's like communism , you heard about the bad news only when they denied them in the official newspaper . 
  as `` rabos\u00edt\u00e1s '' means `` making someone a prisoner '' and it means taking picture and fingerprints in a long procedure on a police station and a registration in the criminal records , i choosed detained . 
  what would you use instead of it ? 
  it is . 
  also `` generally '' and `` only where '' could easily lead to removal . 
  a few weeks ago they did n't allowed a link to post until they checked it as they did n't consider the hungarian site ( a newly created pro-government site ) credible . 
  i think they have a list and ways ( google translate or redditors ) to check hungarian sites . 
  because that would be editorialization and the post would be removed by the admins . 
  i used the original title of the linked article only i changed the name of the town ( siofok ) to hungary as i presumed that the town itself is not widely known here . 
  the hungarian civil liberties union started a campaign cca . 
  a month ago to draw attention to the problem demonstrated by this case ; thanks to recent legislations journalists and citizens active in public life risking more and more when criticizing politicians . 
  [ here ] ( http://hclu.hu/freedom-speech/criticism-public-officials-right-and-duty ) you can find more info in english about this campaign and its goals . 
  `` hungary - 17 people ~ ~ detained ~ ~ called in for questioning , treated as a suspect and had their mugshot and fingerprints taken by the police * because of a facebook share 17 people were ~ ~ interrogated and detained ~ ~ called in for questioning , treated as a suspect and had their mugshot and fingerprints * taken because of a single facebook share in siofok , hungary after the the former mayor of the town , mr. arpad balazs ( fidesz ) filed a report for defamation ( ... ) . 
  the shared facebook entry on the page of the group called `` society of the banned from arpi 's page '' says that a downtown property of the town was sold by arpad balazs as a mayor for shockingly low price ( ... ) . 
  this entry was questioning the legality of the sale , but not posted anything accuses arpad balazs , just wrote that the transaction is suspicious and stated that the contract should be held invalid . 
  after balazs filed a report , the prosecutor 's office stepped in the legal process as a public prosecutor , claiming that the defamation is committed against a public official . 
  mr. peter balazs kovacs , member of the presidency of the opposition democratic coalition 's somogy county group was interrogated amongst the firsts . 
  he is the city 's most famous citizen , moreover , is the former head of local television , a former college professor . 
  to his knowledge , other known local members of dk and the siofok organization of the socialist party is also harrased because of the sharing . 
  he considers the case a concept trial , he said in september during a police interrogation among other things , the interrogators were curious to know whether he knows other people who shared the post . 
  mr. csaba czegl\u00e9dy , socialist politician and lawyer from szombathely who protects nine suspects in the case for free , considers the whole case totally unfounded . 
  he said the post was not abusive and did not call the former mayor corrupt . 
  mr. czegl\u00e9dy became known nationwide when he uncovered the case of the cocaine addict fidesz members ( including a vice-mayor - op ) at szombathely '' edit : please see below for details, 
  even better . 
  i want a tv series about the fecal phantom , with a classic batman-like intro . 
  never mind . 
  it 's just sheer cold war mentality and has nothing to do with the value of your comment . 
  i also think that the turks wanted to show an example and they started the missile in the very moment that the russians entered their airspace . 
  but looking like a pro-russian on reddit is not a good way to popularity , that is why they downvote you . 
  i do n't think that they will start to respect anything as this whole situation with russia largely looks like a new cold war and both sides started to behave accordingly . 
  about chinese english : https://youtu.be/bmaxums84ys it 's a chinese guy who makes stencyl tutorials in * english * . 
  nice . 
  businesslike warning should have contain something about the nationality of the aircraft and its serial number . 
  a businesslike warning should start with one fighter fly beside the violator , while his wingman stay behind the violator to cover its partner . 
  after that the pilot in the fighter beside the violator examine the markings of the violator and start the warning with naming the plane by nationality and serial number . 
  this is the businesslike routine .
