  thanks to this businesslike approach and routine not one russian plane downed in the nato baltic air policing mission since 2004 or not one serbian fighter downed by the hungarian air force in the yugoslavian war . 
  i was n't aware of that , but yes there is one , and it is even on the internet not on tor or something like that . 
  voting 2 years earlier will encourage them to vote more frequently ? 
  why should we stop at 16 ? 
  maybe postman pat will be a mep if we lower the voting age enough . 
  but many went through greece and honestly i really do n't like the `` lack of resources '' part in that paragraph . 
  `` the cost of inaction over securing europe 's external borders were displayed to devastating effect this week , when it emerged that abdelhamid abaaoud , the mastermind behind the paris attacks , had slipped into france unchecked - via greece - without setting off alarms . 
  he had previously joked in the islamic state magazine , dabiq , how he had once been stopped by belgian police but not arrested . 
  the inability of europe to protect its borders has been blamed on a combination of a lack of resources in poorer members like greece , romania and bulgaria and privacy concerns that have stalled necessary legislation in the european parliament . '', 
  also : `` mr leggeri said that frontex could find `` no evidence '' that potential terrorists had used migrant routes to cross back into the eu , but was forced to admit that ** this was probably because it was not connected with anti-terror databases . 
  maybe it 's pretty clear now , i gave up following it in october . 
  september 7 : romania wants schengen rights if refugee quota imposed ; september 8 : romania opposes mandatory refugee quota ; october 5 : previously opposed to quota , prime minister says country could take more asylum-seekers, 
  did you read op ? 
  edit : by the way update me ; what 's your stance now ? 
  once you support , once you oppose , it 's hard to find a firm romanian governmental position on the subject . 
   well , romania got 15,3 billion euros as cohesion funds from the eu for 2014-2020 to rise the standards of living of our population ( and a lot of people live in poverty or on the brink of poverty ) . 
  just to put that `` generous '' 15 billion euros on its place : only hungary exported cca . 
  7 billion euros worth of goods last year to romania . 
  without eu that would mean cca . 
  2.5 billion euros in customs ( with 5 % rate ) in 7 years for the romanian budget . 
  you should n't believe in the selfless generosity of the eu and the western-european nations . 
  ofc eu is good and i am pro-eu , but i do n't like this `` eastern europe ca n't live without eu funds '' myth . 
  this is the main thing : `` the president also emphasized that romania has never been a refugee promised land . '', 
  nor a transit country . 
  this step costs nothing and gives a very progressive , european impression and also positions romania against the v4 , while get some good points from merkel and the eu establishment . 
  that is why v4 should remain 4 . 
  hungary was in the eastern bloc . 
  we [ worked for the soviets ] ( http://iho.hu/img/repules_14_02/140220_kubaszov/soyuz-36.jpg ) . 
  after that our governments did not want to pay 8 million euros in a year , so they did not finished the accession negotiations with esa , which started in 2003 . 
  hungary participated in : [ soyuz 36-salyut 6 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soyuz_36 ) ; [ vega program ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vega_program ) ; [ phobos program ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phobos_program ) ; [ mars 96 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mars_96 ) ; [ cassini -- huygens ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cassini%e2%80%93huygens ) ; iss ; cluster ; rosetta ; stereo etc. 
  gib back treasure to romania !, 
   kick the eastern/southern eu countries out the top export destinations of hungary are germany ( $ 25.3 b ) , romania ( $ 5.73 b ) , italy ( $ 5.06 b ) , austria ( $ 5b ) and france ( $ 4.38 b ) . 
  the top import origins are germany ( $ 22.7 b ) , russia ( $ 7.84 b ) , china ( $ 6.05 b ) , austria ( $ 5.81 b ) and slovakia ( $ 4.68 b ) . 
  and that 's just hungary 's top 5 and cca . 
  $ 78b with eu * . 
  yeah , kick them out . 
   those four countries should forge a political union they did . 
  it 's called european union . 
  hungarian here . 
  we can easily fix that southern problem . 
   refugee vacuum 300k refugees travelled through hungary until the fence was built .

  how barbarian . 
   this is basically a sign that it was a mistake to let the v4 join the eu . 
  they are n't like us . 
  we do n't even share an appreciation for human rights . 
  and your statement is based on what ? 
  have you heard of ukip , national front , golden dawn etc.

  here is the whole 2014 article : http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/12/a-fragile-rebound-for-eu-image-on-eve-of-european-parliament-elections/, 
  [ source ] ( http://www.tarki.hu/hu/news/2015/kitekint/20151118_befogad.html ), 
  i see , but sadly no special treatment allowed since human rights kicked in 25 years ago . 
  they could even get a kosher menu if they ask for it . 
  but ofc there are the prisoners , and i do n't think that they like terrorists ( there were news a few months ago about 3 persons who killed a little kid a few years ago ; their life became a nightmare in prison ) . 
  i do n't think that for the lack of documents they would end up in jail . 
  if there was an offence , that was in the uk , hungarian authorities just stopped them . 
  but i really do n't care about this , i bet we have enough beans for a few more prisoner , but `` squalid prison '' ... you know we are not turkey or mexico . 
  according to [ origo.hu ] ( http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20151118-terror-tamogatokat-fogtak-a-magyar-rendorok.html ) one of them handed over a quran to the policemen when they asked for an id . 
  they were on their way to bucharest , romania . 
   ... overcome their differences  palestinians actually has the only one trying to solve the issue , they created their own state and want to create their own currency and their own central bank . 
  israelian are blocking foreign payment , blocking all efforts of theses . 
  all i want to tell you is that not one palestinian movement , authority , party etc. 
  recognized israel 's [ right to exist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_to_exist#israel_and_palestine ) . 
  menachem begin told in 1977 ( almost 40 years before ) , that `` our right to exist -- have you ever heard of such a thing ? 
  would it enter the mind of any briton or frenchman , belgian or dutchman , hungarian or bulgarian , russian or american , to request for its people recognition of its right to exist ? '', 
  how ( and why ) should the palestinians make peace with someone who has no right to exist ? 
  why should israel allow the palestinians to form a state , which denies the very existence of israel and claims the territory of israel ? 
   benjamin nettanyou is the problem he was elected on a democratic election . 
  that is far more than what you can tell about most of the arab leaders . 
  you did not present any argument also , it really sounds like a stoned leftist fairy wondering in the woods and talking about world peace . 
  the fact is a fact : palestinians do n't have a scenario for a peace , where islam would n't `` obliterate '' israel . 
  sorry , but sometimes the truth is very simple ; and the easy , wide , `` everybody is right '' road is just not the way to go . 
  the core of the complex situation is simple : the palestinian side rejects any compromise . 
  look at the covenant of hamas : `` israel will exist and will continue to exist until islam will obliterate it , just as it obliterated others before it . '', 
  - preamble `` the islamic resistance movement is a distinguished palestinian movement , whose allegiance is to allah , and whose way of life is islam . 
  it strives to raise the banner of allah over every inch of palestine . '', 
  - article 6 `` the day of judgment will not come about until moslems fight jews and kill them . 
  then , the jews will hide behind rocks and trees , and the rocks and trees will cry out : ' o moslem , there is a jew hiding behind me , come and kill him . '', 
  - article 7 '' [ peace ] initiatives , and so-called peaceful solutions and international conferences are in contradiction to the principles of the islamic resistance movement ... those conferences are no more than a means to appoint the infidels as arbitrators in the lands of islam ... 
  there is no solution for the palestinian problem except by jihad . 
  initiatives , proposals and international conferences are but a waste of time , an exercise in futility . '', 
  - article 13, 
   israel is the one that is carrying on one of the longest military occupations in history . 
  israel is the state that rules over millions of palestinians who do n't have a right to vote while the israelis is their midst do . 
  israel is the one that has repeatedly invaded and bombed neighboring countries . 
  israel is the state that continues to build settlements in defiance of international law . 
  the truth is that israel won the war against the palestinians/arabs . 
  a very long time ago . 
  decades ago . 
  it is the arabs , who do n't want to accept any compromise and do n't want a lasting peace . 
  they want to dictate terms for the victors . 
  they do n't want a viable , even temporary solution , they want a total triumph . 
  it is the arabs who did not help their own kind to start a new life , but let them rot in refugee camps . 
  the same number of jews left the arab countries since 1948 ( iraq , egypt , yemen had a jewish population since the ancient times ) and they were integrated into the israeli society . 
  israel can wipe out the palestinians at any time , it 's just a matter of will , not military might . 
  arabs would like to wipe out israel , it 's not a matter of will on their side , they simply do n't have the military might . 
  if you want israel to make peace on the arabs ' terms , well that would be a deliberate collective suicide of a whole country , which is an unknown phenomenon in the history of the human race . 
   all of that breeds huge resentment in the region and helps feed the islamists propaganda machine .
