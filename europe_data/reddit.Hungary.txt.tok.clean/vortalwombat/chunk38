  the fact , that israel is a western-type country , with freedoms and rights breeds huge resentment amongst those who do n't like the european way of life . 
   israeli-palestinian war is quite ongoing but still , it 's not the same as it was in the 70s or 80s , as there is the pna . 
   bosnia is a frozen conflict if a conflict is frozen for 20 + years , that 's good enough for me . 
  that must be a new thing , berets are not traditional in hungarian army . 
  maybe some high ranking wise guy saw a british war movie and decided that berets are cool . 
  it 's even possible that someone in the mod had a good connection to the hungarian beret industry . 
  the traditional cap is that pointed baseball cap-like hat . 
  the military police has that red sign on their left shoulder on the photos , but otherwise they are regular soldiers , just like an artilleryman is a soldier as well . 
  besides every soldier is a rifleman , did n't you heard that ? 
   there is no national guard-like unit in hungary . 
  national guard is not a police force , they are reservists , who have normal jobs and serve a few weeks/months in every year in their unit under normal circumstances . 
  i see you do n't get the / s sign . 
  i wanted to suggest with the previous comment , that the future of syria should be settled by the locals as it is not a game . 
  i do n't think that a capable fighting force should be created out of those who left their country for europe . 
  if the so called experts start to create scenarios in the foreign offices across europe and north-america to create plans for the future of syria ... well , that is how this whole mess was started in iraq , syria , lybia . 
  the best is to make every anti-isis faction to sit down and talk , and do n't let them to leave unless they reach an agreement , like the clinton administration did in the case of bosnia and israeli-palestinian * conflict . 
  yes , we should do that . 
  after creating an own faction we should attack the surrounding towns to obtain raw materials and ofc we should make alliances . 
  after 1000 xp we will be able to advance to a new technology level if we have enough money , food and raw material . 
  ( but we should always keep an eye on the moral of our population . ), 
  well , i am/we are flattered . 
  if you are proud of your european heritage and roots , i guess you can call yourself `` european '' even if you are from argentina . 
  why does this matter for you ? 
  `` sit down , please . 
  let your stirring tale be said . 
  we are listening to you , some will be just glad , to see today , tonight , a european amidst white . '', 
  - attila j\u00f3zsef : welcome to thomas mann, 
   did n't have the exact time zones for the ` eastern ' most countries  i also did n't list a lot of the smaller city-states/islands , like hungary . 
  every neighbour around us made it to your list ( except ukrain ** e ** * , but it 's just even worse for you , dude you 're in a deep mess ) . 
  your anti-magyarism is noted , our retaliation will be swift and severe . 
  do n't buy green bananas anymore .

  i felt safe even before but i am reckless . 
  iirc there are 110 hungarian soldiers in kurdistan already . 
  the foreign minister said in september , that `` if we truly intend to ease the migration pressure on europe , then we must step up our efforts against the islamic state '' , and `` hungary is prepared to do so , and so our contingent of 110 soldiers , who are already in kurdistan , will from now on take part in training kurdish peshmerga fighters alongside their security and protection tasks '' . 
  he is a jerk , but he is right in this issue . 
  that is sure . 
  everyone could achieve much more if they went for budapest , just look at the \u00c9jjel-nappal budapest . 
  i do n't think that they want to attack hungary ( we are not known enough internationally for that ) , but there is paks or the universities with many foreign students across the country everywhere from gy\u0151r to szeged , from p\u00e9cs to debrecen , or the nato base at p\u00e1pa , several government offices across the country , like the hm in sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r etc. 
  well , si vis pacem , para bellum , you know .

  `` i am dismayed at the series of horrible and cowardly attacks last night in paris '' said l\u00e1szl\u00f3 tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi , minister of justice , former hungarian ambassador to french , at the rally outside the french institute of budapest . 
  \u00c9ric fournier , france 's ambassador to hungary , also made a speech paying tribute to victims of the november 13 attacks . 
  he said he was `` very touched by the gestures of affection given in the night '' and stressed that hungarians and french were united against barbarism . 
  the government of hungary has declared a national day of mourning for sunday . 
  also the orb\u00e1n government has announced new , stricter national border controls and a military presence on the streets of hungarian cities , following an emergency meeting of the national security cabinet in budapest , early saturday morning .

  i am not saying that , i am implying that . 
  politics 101 . , 
  no you did not . 
  i do n't have problems with romanians , only i do n't like hypocrisy . 
  for me it 's obvious , that there is only one reason behind those statements like ; the hungarians did nothing in transylvania , the hungarians are just poor invaders and evil oppressors , austrians and saxons were the real guys , romania treats the ethnic minorities well , only the hungarians ... blahblahblah ... so the real reason behind these false statements is the fact that there are 1.3 million ethic hungarians in transylvania , 36k germans and no austrians . 
  romania destroyed the german minority , they are not a problem any more . 
  now it could be said that they left their ancient lands `` for a better life '' , `` went home '' . 
  there home was there , in siebenb\u00fcrgen . 
  there were 750k ethic germans in 1930 in romania and 380k in 1956 and only 36k today . 
  not 12 klaus johannis can change that . 
  the usual , often heard lies about the hungarians in transylvania have just one goal ; to ease the assimilation , thus the disapperance of the transylvanian hungarians by destroying their pride in their history and traditions and nationality . 
  please note , that i do n't want to win this debate on reddit , or on r/europe , which has many romanian subscribers , ( and not the place to debate about this ) but romanians should understand that no matter what they say , there were , there are , and there will be hungarians in transylvania . 
   nobody expelled the germans from sibiu , they left for better life in west germany . 
  after 800 years they left for a better life . 
  sure they did . 
  nice us flag by the way , but what 's your problem with the romanian tricolor ? 
  i believe you , but he is still a better known writer . 
  totally agree with that , and t\u00f3t\u00e9k ( toth family ) by \u00d6rk\u00e9ny is also a brilliant one . 
  look at this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sibiu#population_dynamics what are we talking about when according to the romanian opinion hungarians oppressed everybody for 1000 years , and the romanians are just the best possible dudes on earth ? 
  after a century virtually no saxon or hungarian remained in sibiu , but when they elected a saxon president a few months ago they started to tell us here on reddit , that they are really pro-saxon country . 
  and do you want a romanian to tell something good about hungarians ? 
  it 's like asking a turk to tell something nice about bulgarians . 
   germans , yes . 
  hungarians , not so much ... a bit brave statement , considering the thousand year of hungarian rule in transylvania . 
  almost upvoted your comment , but i ca n't because of the hajr\u00e1 felcs\u00fat . 
  edit :  i thought for a moment that some murder got covered up or something . 
  sure he is . 
  i like szeg\u00e9nyek iskol\u00e1ja ( school of the poor ) and his [ poem ] ( http://www.magyarulbabelben.net/works/hu/m%c3%a1rai_s%c3%a1ndor-1900/mennyb%c5%91l_az_angyal/en/23833-angel_from_the_heaven?interfacelang=en ) about 1956 . 
  ** translation : ** this is how orban and the state owned media manipulate the photos the revealing article immediately was removed , but now we show all the false pictures . 
  stalin smack contentedly in his grave , the staff of president putin begging in tears for the know-how . 
  `` in the morning , several hundred people gathered in kossuth square , who wanted to have a word or a handshake with the prime minister . 
  touching moments witnessed those who saw viktor orb\u00e1n who was welcomed by an elderly lady with a heart-touching line from a poem . 
  although his schedule was very tight , the prime minister as he saw the crowd waiting for him , decided to share some thoughts with the enthusiastic ny\u00edregyh\u00e1zians on the square . '', 
  this was written by attila petneh\u00e1zy , mp of the region on his homepage last year , when in the election campaign viktor orb\u00e1n visited ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za . 
  we should note , that on his nation-wide campaign trail before the last year 's election , such spontaneous mass waited for the pm in every town , and the prime minister always found time to give a spontaneous speech to the enthusiastic crowd , in the accidentally presence of his media staff . 
  this needs to be bring up , as a result of the kett\u0151s m\u00e9rce ( double standard ) tumblr article , which was allow the press to talk about how the [ mti ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyar_t%c3%a1virati_iroda ) manipulated the photos . 
  the revealing picture and article published by the szabolcs online was removed after the turmoil , but for a while , by the courtesy of google it was available - then we made the screenshot below . 
  the index.hu added , that the szabolcs online website run almost entirely on public ads . 
  the story is already evokes the world of semi-dictatorship , but the situation is even worse . 
  not only the mti manipulated . 
  below we gathered all the pictures that could be found about the spontaneous speech , and it is difficult to draw a conclusion other than that the state news agency , viktor orban 's media staff and the mayor of ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za rigged in a coordinated manner . 
  they did a careful job . 
  it must have been just a coincidence , let 's look at famous professional facebook page orban , there we will find the truth !, 
  even this may be a coincidence , right ? 
  the fidesz mayor of ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za fortunately also published a series of photos of spontaneous meeting , there will be everything in its place !, 
  if there was n't that little lack of attention in the editorial room of the county newspaper , we should only know these pictures about the visit . 
  and now you think about it , how many times slipping into such a miscue , and how many times we see only and exclusively the manipulated images . 
  that is very subjective . 
  some like celestial harmonies by [ p\u00e9ter esterh\u00e1zy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a9ter_esterh%c3%a1zy ) , [ fateless ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fatelessness ) by [ imre kert\u00e9sz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imre_kert%c3%a9sz ) or [ school at the frontier ] ( https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/geza-ottlik/school-at-the-frontier/ ) by [ g\u00e9za ottlik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%a9za_ottlik ) , while some like [ give me back my mountains ] ( http://www.magtudin.org/albert_wass_give_me_back_my_mountains.htm ) by [ albert wass ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albert_wass ) . 
  ofc sometimes a western reader ca n't understand the hungarian books , because of historical reasons . 
  for example for them the school at the frontier is maybe just a book about a school , for a hungarian reader it 's about independence , integrity and resistance to authority .
