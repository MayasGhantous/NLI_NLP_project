  each content provider will be obliged to employ national security officers , if a request is received from the national security agencies , according to a proposed amendment to the national security act by interior minister sandor pinter .

  however , section 38 of that amendment package is an amendment to the national security act . 
  it is about those organizations , which have to employ the members of the national security services . 
  ** most of the specified organizations in the amendment ( public authorities of particular importance for national security , long-term state-owned entities , the telecommunications and postal services , key institutions of the power grid , military research establishments and institutions ) are such organizations where the presence of the secret services is not surprising . 
  but pinter mentioned among the organizations those `` infrastructure , application and content providers '' which will be determined by later legislation . 
  pinter does not define in the explanatory part what content providers are involved .

   i 'm not the one down voting you . 
  i did n't think that and did n't want to imply that . 
  i meant that you wanted to prove that `` glory '' stands for some pro-habsburg sentiment on my side , i am sorry that it was n't clear enough . 
  [ for your valiant service in defending the homeland . 
  wow , you are really into this . 
  thus passes the glory of the world means that something which was glorious , great etc. 
  once disappeared . 
  it has nothing to do with mourning or regret . 
  it 's not a feeling . 
   your original remark is ill fitting in a topic about czechoslovakia 's independence , imo . 
  because czechoslovakia is well and alive ? 
  anyway , if you want to know my opinion , one thing is common in the habsburg empire and czechoslovakia ; both survived far longer ( habsburg empire : cca . 
  100 years ; czechoslovakia : cca . 
  50 years ) than they should thanks to the international relations . 
  when the slovaks had a chance to create an independent state they did that without any hesitation , twice . 
  that 's the point of using a proverb . 
  honi soit qui mal y pense as sic transit gloria mundi was more like a general observation on my part regarding both the fate of the habsburgs and czechoslovakia , not some kind of a habsburg adoration . 
  we have a proverb which goes as : `` it does matter on which side of the dick you are . '', 
  he did n't say that , but the rest of the interview suggests that because of their secularity they are not able to understand the current situation , if i understand that correctly . 
  cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war !, 
  thanks . 
  this question was asked here before many times , and my answer is just the same as it was before : goauld as that language has only two words : jaffa and kree . 
  okay , please let me know your decision .
