  only the holiday dishes are seasonal here . 
  the szomsz\u00e9d n\u00e9ni produkci\u00f3s iroda ( neighbor auntie production office ) stand-up group ( two transylvanian guys ) has a joke , that goes like : `` i like to speak with people who know nothing about transylvania . 
  when they hear that i am from there , they say , that ` ah . 
  transylvania ... what nice mountains you have got there ! / yep . / and you have fine palinkas , right ? / yep . / and what are you doing in that transylvania all day long ? / well , we are drinking our palinka and puking in the mountains . '', 
  well , the hortobagyi pancake ( the one with meat ) is not the proudest part of the hungarian cuisine , that is for sure . 
  it was invented in the 1950s to recycle the meat which was remained from other dishes . 
  it is not as bad though , it 's more like a bad lasagne . 
  the more typical flavours are the apricot jam , cocoa powder with sugar and cottage cheese with cinnamon . 
  and we toss it also . 
  it 's an everyday , cheap meal in hungary , iirc you need just flour , milk , egg , water and salt to prepare them . 
  also it 's a favorite street food alongside [ langos ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-j7guwqwzitg/ucdb0hl-rli/aaaaaaaapf8/3cremokji9c/s1600/img_5297_a.jpg ) , hot-dog and hamburgers . 
  ( we even eat pancakes filled with meat , known as pancake a la hortobagy , but you should n't try that in a restaurant , as in many restaurants they use it as a way to recycle meat , as the dough and souce cover everything . ), 
  what else ? 
  the method is the same in hungary for preparing stuffed cabbages . 
  from the tuica picture it is apparent that we share the great passion of make liquor out of any available fruit . 
  oss 117 - one of the few examples when the second movie is just as good as the first . 
  i hope there will be a third eventually . 
  it 's still luxurious , as the hungarian crepes looks like [ these ] ( http://content1.tastebook.com/content/photo/user_photo/dhthszft13c213436323832333wfgvzzku_1349782667.jpg ) and usually filled with jam , cocoa or cottage cheese . 
  that 's what i call a luxury crepe . 
  my second guess would be the chicken tikka masala for britain . 
  the pork knuckle is fine , but honestly i anticipated some more sauerkrauter dish with sausages from germany . 
  til that thing has meat inside . 
  i thought it 's just a big potato in some kind of a sauce . 
  at least the poles still have [ parades ] ( https://youtu.be/4dimwl-gk-i ) . 
  the [ last ] ( https://youtu.be/as9twhiikau ) hungarian was in 1985 on the 40th anniversary of the liberation of hungary . 
  that was a good choice , best dishes are always hot and spicy . 
  it once again proved that the nation lives in its language . 
  or according to the ancient hungarian custom you should multiply your curse with a combo like `` h\u00fazz\u00e1l te kiscs\u00edra / geciputtony/faszkalap az any\u00e1d v\u00e9rveres pics\u00e1j\u00e1ba oszt ' ott v\u00e1rd meg az ap\u00e1d fasz\u00e1t ! '', 
  - * `` get lost to your mother 's blood-red cunt you little seed/jizz basket/dick hat then wait there for your father 's dick . 
  '' * to deliver a decent one . 
  largest ethnic minority are the romas , largest national minority are the germans . 
  ofc the romas steal everything and the germans always try to cut the public spending . 
   i 've never seen your national treasures angels of the sportklub on a [ kettlebell training ] ( http://m.youtube.com/watch?list=pla6ebnaznquqrruk22ayxeaywrl-frnal&amp;v=eossud49fvk ) . 
  a typical hungarian [ folk tale ] ( http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tn3b3lfguim ) with james earl jones getting a sack of gold or something like that in the end . 
  translation : `` the last two employees spend their resignation time ~ ~ in ~ ~ until september . 
  istv\u00e1n l\u00f6ffler , who deals with air conditioner installation for twenty years in sopron will left alone after that . 
  ` for two months , i have constantly advertise the vacancies , but there is no candidate . 
  unfortunately , in the recent years even an employee , who had worked here for a decade also quit ; we ca n't compete with austrian wages . ', 
  in the 50s in hungary they always talked about how the `` decadent west is wallowing in the coca-cola rapture '' , so many hungarians waited for some kind of an ecstasy when they first tasted it after 1956 . 
  and [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u8vvkhl.png ) is how it looks like from r/russia . 
  it was asked in a deleted comment here if he was an immigrant . 
  just to clarify this , this guy is a hungarian citizen , and it is not easy to [ obtain a hungarian citizenship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_nationality_law ) for a non-ethnic hungarian . 
  so he is not looks like an immigrant , rather like a non ethnic hungarian , like [ claudia aryee ] ( http://sportklub.tv/content/uploads/sites/2/2014/08/tucsi_nevjegy.jpg ) tv presenter , [ judit onyutha ] ( http://www.storyonline.hu/data/cikk/3/20231/1.jpg ) weatherwoman , [ art\u00far k\u00e1lid ] ( http://ridikul.tv/cuccok/kepek_vendegekhez/kep437.jpg ) actor , [ hesna al ghaoui ] ( http://hu.socialdaily.com/uploads/article/2010_11_08_hesna_video-blog.jpg ) m1 war correspondent and many more . 
  that is why it is not a good idea to tell southern europeans to behave in a bus queue . 
  check out the program [ here ] ( http://www.siaf.sk/en/program/ ) . 
  the dreadful [ pact of rozsadomb ] ( http://hungarianspectrum.org/2008/08/07/hungarian-extreme-right-in-its-own-voice/ ) , where the us , the soviets , the israelis , the hungarian anti-communist and communist parties organized the fall of the communism in hungary . 
  i think that those people who sees the sharia in every dish should lighten up a bit . 
  if a muslim violates those rights what you said , then that muslim should be prosecuted in those cases . 
  i do n't want to repeat myself , but the `` eat your dish or you 're a terrorist '' is not a good mentality . 
  for example in the 1970s , when the hungarian air force instructors left egypt , they throw a party for the egyptians , which was a great success . 
  when the soviets saw that they also throw one with bacon ( salo ) and vodka . 
  the egyptian fighter pilots of the time were not religious , but they left the soviet party shortly after they ate the bacon and drank the vodka . 
  i told this anecdote just to show that it 's sometimes just gross for them to eat pork . 
  yes . 
  eating pork is also disgusting and gross for a non-religious person with muslim background . 
  it 's not just religion . 
  it 's their culture . 
  eating dog or guinea pig or bugs is an everyday custom in several countries . 
  again , you should not judge people based on their diets and beliefs . 
  because based on what you wrote your diet is also based on beliefs , however you tried to hide it behind some seemingly logical reasoning . 
  and by the way what immigrants ? 
  france has muslim citizens since the 19th century , the jews are emancipated there since the revolution . 
  edit : samy naceri , dany boon , zidane just to mention a few are just immigrants ? 
  do you prefer your rat stew with rice or noodles ? 
  pork is a cultural taboo for them , like eating dogs and cats is a cultural taboo for most of the europeans . 
  using dietary customs to determine stupidity is stupid . 
  snails are also haram and not kosher , so it 's hard to be a muslim or a jew in france . 
  it would be much cheaper if the type of the meat does n't matter at all , if french municipalities would import stray dogs from eastern europe in order to supply the schools with cheap meat . 
  also maybe it 's time to reread swift 's modest proposal . 
  a classic from 2008 : [ tanks are invading georgia ?

  i guess bugyi is in the top three . 
  no , [ tata ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tata,_hungary ) is hungarian , actually . 
  i do n't consider it a european country myself , but it 's in the upper right corner of the sub 's map . 
  edit : [ this ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/video/europe/2012/09/%20201291215548920251.html ) is not european at all . 
   what is the slovakias industrial strategy ? 
  to become the ( pre-2008 ) detroit of europe . 
  it 's broadcasted in almost every european country so i think you will definitely find such site . 
  watchseries and alikes . 
  [ german crashes dubbed in french ] ( https://youtu.be/-ucyddwa4ie ), 
  the article is about politics , politics , politics and suddenly the conclusion is : `` to the european banks and companies that invested heavily in the ` growth wonder ' , turkey , we have one advice : make sure to find the exit before everyone else wants to get out . '', 
  what ? 
  how ? 
  why ? 
  i do not agree with your decision as this case reminds greece 's situation in another union , the european union and it gives us an opportunity to observe another solution for a similar problem . 
  because it is that and it 's full with weird people . 
  `` those people who have nothing are worth just that '' - [ j\u00e1nos l\u00e1z\u00e1r ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%a1nos_l%c3%a1z%c3%a1r ), 
  another myth of r/europe has been busted . 
  if i did n't help the american military guy to buy land in hungary from the money ( usd 15,000,000 , - ) which he looted with his platoon in afghanistan , and i did n't help the escaping syrian widow ( of a high-ranking official ) to buy a mansion for her children ( also for usd 15,000,000 , - ) in europe , then i certainly wo n't help a lambrapopolu inside the eu . 
  it surpassed jurassic world , furious 7 , age of ultron from this year . 
  ( and also surpassed the wolf of wall street , hobbit 3 , inception , pirates of the caribbean : on stranger tides etc. ), 
  in the last 6 years only the avatar was more popular . 
  yes , that was the last one and hearing mexico '86 is still painful for many hungarians . 
  [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/jijjndn0_kq ? ), 
  match ( hungary - soviet union 0-6 ) is still shocking to watch . 
  that was a national shock back then . 
  everyone over 35 remembers that match . 
  the main thing is like : `` cluj is a beautiful city , it lies at the szamos ( somes * ) , i have a little house there , live with me there . '', 
  that 's the no. 1 cluj song in hungarian . 
  ( but in the german libretto it 's varazdin . ),
