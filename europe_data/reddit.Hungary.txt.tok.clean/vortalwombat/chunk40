  ** translation : ** the leaders of the muslim masses clearly see that the situation is ripe for the occupation of * our apostate continent . 
  they are helped in this by the totally secularized european leaders ' ( with some exceptions ) naivety - said the archbishop of veszpr\u00e9m , gyula m\u00e1rfi . 
  according to the roman catholic archibishop , according to muslims ' beliefs europe is a theatre of war , and it 's not customary to escape into a war zone . 
  although among the reasons of the migration there are the narrowing living space in the middle east because of the wars and ecological disasters , and even the hope for a better life , but the contemporary migration has not only causes , but also goals . 
  these include , according to archibishop m\u00e1rfi the desire of european big business for a cheap labor force , and the fact that certain non-european superpowers are working to weaken europe . 
  he added that some incomprehensible facts came to light , that in addition to the arabian banks , us banks also support the immigrants , `` who they love to call refugees . '', 
  perhaps this may be the reason why the loud advertisers of the tolerance help the intollerant immigrants - said the archbishop , who has emphasized that these are just his own personal views . 
  ** from christ under the yoke of mohamed ** gyula m\u00e1rfi added that european leaders `` do not convey the power of faith , can not imagine that the religious conviction of the broad masses have a great power . 
  they only think about money and everyday politics . 
  they give speeches about such european values ( like freedom and equality ) , which are no longer exist in europe . 
  they confuse equality with uniformity ( genderideology ) and liberty with libertine behaviour , which make the citizens of europe the prisoners of their own passions . 
  the archbishop believes that `` europe got rid of christ 's gentle yoke , '' and now is in danger , that the more sinister yoke of mohamed will be placed onto her . 
  ** the christians and jews will be tolerated , the immoral will not . 
  ** according to the archbishop , if the islamisation of europe continues , the muslims will become the majority on the continent in fifty years and then europe really will be under islamic rule . 
  `` they will probably persecute just those who are infidels and immorals according to their standards ( gay couples , gay festivals , genderideology , the charlie hebdo-like journals , expressions which are defamatory for god and religion ) . 
  devouted christians , jews and others will be tolerated , especially those who have a holy book ( in arabic : quran ) . 
  however , the years will be counted probably not from the birth of jesus , but from the escape of prophet mohamed from mecca to medina , the weekly feast day wo n't be on sunday , but on friday , christmas and easter will be celebrated much more discreetly , as we celebrate it now . '', 
  he added that the new christian churches will not be built , but will be able to operate if the members of their parish will maintain them , however , we have to be aware that some extremist muslims sometimes will put some church on fire and murder members of prayer groups . 
  the perpetrators will be declared criminals by the islamic state , but that is not necessarily means that they will be found and punished . 
  ** `` this migration is probably the punishment of god '' ** m\u00e1rfi gyula quoted the prophets who said that israel ( 722bc ) , and judea and jerusalem ( 586bc ) was conquered `` because instead of yahweh , people worshiped idols . '', 
  if europe falls , it will be caused by a modern idolatry ( worship of money , power , and the forbidden delights ) '' - added the prelate . 
  the archbishop of veszpr\u00e9m said in response to the statements of pope francis , that `` the pope is only infallible when he defines a doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held by the whole church . 
  this is not what this situation is about . 
  `` the holy father 's request that each parish accomodate syrian refugee families as many places as possible , is not feasible because of `` a great number of parishes can not sustain itself without outside help . 
  moreover , the overwhelming majority of immigrants are not refugees , not syrian , and not family . '', 
  m\u00e1rfi gyula says : `` the pope is also influenced by the fact that his parents were immigrants in argentina . 
  but there are huge differences between immigration and immigration . 
  the holy father 's parents went as christians to a christian country , so they could easily adapt to new surroundings . 
  however , the muslims can not and do not want to adapt . '', 
  `` they - as i said - came to fight on a battlefield , they came not to adapt , but to conquer . '', 
   they are the left wing version of kuruc . 
  so not true . 
  while kuruc.info is about `` anti-hungarianism '' , `` gipsy-crimes '' , `` jewish-crimes '' and holocaust denial , 444 . hu is just a left-wing hipster bunch . 
  cunning and true . 
  i see . 
  climate change and eu is an interesting issue indeed . 
  i read an article about eu , carmakers and diesel engines recently : http://www.vox.com/2015/10/15/9541789/volkswagen-europe-diesel-pollution, 
  are you sure that this is a r/europe thing ?

  some say you do n't need butter for a grilled cheese sandwich . 
  those people are wrong . 
  you can put butter even inside your sandwich . 
  and yes , you can put ketchup on your grilled cheese sandwich and to tell the truth , you should . 
  it 's based on 128k voters ' choice . 
  dresden is german and london is the tenth on the list . 
  nice try and i appreciate it , but honestly it reminds me of [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/bqnfnwsyzaq ) .

   the name did n't ring a bell straightaway `` he was voted by a panel of retired diplomats , journalists , academics and think-tankers on 14 november 2012 as the fourth most influential briton on eu policy '' - wikipedia . 
  this is eu . 
  we do n't know him , but he is influental . 
  i did n't claim that . 
  i wrote `` as far as i see '' . 
  but ofc as i only speak with people when we are marching up and down the street in our fancy black uniforms , i am not a reliable source , my mighty liberal compatriot . 
  i did n't say anything about holidays , but why not ? 
  a few years before hungarians left slovakia for the austrian ski resorts for a similar reason . 
   to shift the problem onto someone else , yes . 
  but when someone else shift the problem on us , it 's ok , right ? 
   as a croat , all we see is hungary building a fence towards us , a friendly country , as if saying `` fuck you , deal with this yourselves , we do n't care '' croatia sent 200k immigrants without any discusson or agreement to hungary after lecturing us for weeks on how to handle the situation properly . 
  now you do the same with slovenia . 
  what a friendly behavior . 
  [ number of intercepted migrants in the last 30 days ] ( http://www.police.hu/hirek-es-informaciok/hatarinfo/elfogott-migransok-szama ) . 
  - 09.20 : 6941 ; 10.19 : 22 immigrants . 
  since january 390k immigrants entered hungary . 
  since september 200k . 
  on sunday : 0 from croatia . 
  this is the logic behind the fence . 
  well , then it 's good to you , i suppose . 
  you can destroy it for a long time . 
  afais on the level of the average hungarian citizen it 's gone for a long time . 
  on monday at dawn the z\u00e1hony border crossing had to be closed , because of a huge raid , which was held by the police in [ z\u00e1hony ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/z%c3%a1hony ) . 
  in the raid 39 houses were searched , police questioned 30 suspects and 21 people were arrested . 
  one border protection officer was caught in the act as he took bribes and 950 euros was found in his underwear . 
  in addition on different locations millions of hufs and thousands of euros were seized by prosecutors . 
  several of the suspects made a plea agreement on the scene . 
  the investigation concluded that police officers serving on the z\u00e1hony border crossing was routinely demanded bribes ranging from 20 to 100 euros - obviously from those who had a reason to fear a possible check . 
  the practice was that passengers put the money in their passport and the policemen hid the money into their underwears ( or bras in the case of the policewomen ) . 
  today 's action means that is almost no one left in the z\u00e1hony border police force , who is not on the radar of the the prosecutor 's office . 
  the prosecutors started proceedings against 11 policemen from zahony in august , because of participation in cigarette smuggling . 
  in july eighteen customs officer and three civilians were arrested by the police also for participating in cigarette smuggling and today all policemen on duty were arrested on the checkpoint . 
  it 's not about just the mol or hungarian media ( or governments * ) . 
  in the yugoslav war and ever since the hungarian public was overwhelmingly pro-croatian and croatia was seen as a traditionally friendly country , which we need to help ( with arms or to join the eu , nato etc. ) . 
  this nationwide attitude towards croatia disappeared in the last years . 
  but ofc it 's not a problem for me , if it 's ok for the croatians . 
  ** f\u0151zel\u00e9k ** is a type of thick hungarian vegetable stew . 
  it is a special category in hungarian cuisine , not quite like a soup , and thinner than a stew . 
  it is simply cooked , typically by simmering , not mashed . 
  f\u0151zel\u00e9k is often eaten as the main course for lunch or like a garnish for different meat courses . 
  f\u0151zel\u00e9k is typically a home-made food , and being considered as an ordinary type of meal , it seldom ( or never ) appears on restaurant menu cards , apart from that of cheap diners . 
  - [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/f%c5%91zel%c3%a9k ) [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/ip7wjzaas8e ) is a video about how to prepare a squash stew aka t\u00f6kf\u0151zel\u00e9k .
