  it 's off topic , but do croatians realize that they are slowly but steadily destroying their relations with the hungarian public ? 
  croatians in hungary was always seen as a friendly nation , with which we share a long history and common heritage etc. 
  and now it 's gone . 
  not ca n't but need n't . 
  there would be a quick solution ; get rid of dublin iii , register the migrants when they enter the schengen zone ( in hungary or elsewhere ) , and let them move freely after that ( to germany or elsewhere ) . 
  it 's better than to make a refugee camp out of serbia or croatia . 
  but it 's easier to hide the main problem ; that the current system ca n't handle this situation . 
  it 's like the euro and greece all over again , just this time with migrants . 
  well it once again proved that it 's much easier to get rid of the problem than solve it . 
  it 's not about what they want , it 's about obey the law and follow procedures .

  some of the hungarians now feels like `` to mortal eyes , you , hope , do seem a form divinely sweet ; but eyes of gods can pierce the dream and see your blind deceit . 
  i had depended on your speech , but you have ever cheated . '',

  hungary did in 2008 . 
  that is the neverland of europe , where the lost cars live . 
  - meter the milk with the chauffeur . 
  so this recipe is for the rich only . 
  no , i just like it , but the recipe looks fine . 
  somloi and gundel pancake are also good choices indeed .

  [ recipe ] ( http://zsuzsaisinthekitchen.blogspot.hu/2012/02/bonfire-stack-maglyarakas.html ), 
  i prefer it without meat , but you can try with [ sausages ] ( http://www.theopapa.hu/pix/etlap/_big/659.jpg ) , [ pork ] ( http://grocceni.com/kep/lecsosszelet.jpg ) or [ beef ] ( http://www.thokolyrestaurant.hu/etlap/gjopteglr1427298043.jpg ) or with [ foie gras ] ( http://mindmegette.hu/lapokkepek/receptgaleriak/16000/16155_piritott_lecsos_libamaj_n.jpg ) . 
  but it 's also good with pan-fried chicken liver and polenta .

  police launched an investigation into a case of attempted murder , a policeman was injured on his leg ( he was in shock and tried to crawl to his colleague to help when the first passers-by arrived ) and a policewoman on her head ( she was unconscious ) . 
  according to sources it could be anything from gas leak to a nail bomb . 
  according to [ hvg.hu ] ( http://hvg.hu/itthon/20160925_terez_korut_robbanas_vasarnap_helyszinelok_csobomba_gyanus_alak ) someone targeted those two officers * with the attack and used a nail bomb . 
  someone saw a man who waited for the police officers to pass by him and after that he threw something on them , which was exploded a few seconds later . 
  he left the scene after the explosion and stared at the injured officers , but did not help them . 
  * ( last update on hvg.hu - 12:18 ) a press conference will be held at 18:30 cet by the police . 
   requires sources to have a certain level of credibility ... the mods are doing a service to the sub to bans news from certain sources we have a pointless conversation here . 
  i do n't believe in the `` sit down here , now we will tell you what to think '' type of journalism regardless of the source , i do n't agree with this well known `` curated subreddit '' stuff , the `` this and that source is not credible '' , `` this rape is local but this albanian melon festival is international news '' stuffs and that is why i stopped using r/europe as a news source . 
  i do n't want to change this sub , i do n't want to start another sub and i do n't want to bogged down in a pointless debate . 
  ( and i understand the reason behind these measures as i saw what happened with this whole migration-news-flood last year , only i do n't agree with this solution . 
  ) * i feel that you started to defend something from me ( i am not sure what are you defending , but i am not really interested in this thing . ), 
  i guess we can both spend this beautiful afternoon better . 
  great username . 
   that may be why you do n't understand the banning of rt. 
  i do n't understand it because i believe that a grown adult person is able to differentiate between news and sources . 
  i do n't defend rt , i say that an average person can differentiate between true and false and admins are not tutors . 
  i simply do n't like censorship . 
  not long time ago in hungary everyone was able to `` read between the lines '' and in 1990 it was a great thing that the censorship and self-censorship of the journalists were disappeared . 
  ofc i do n't understand . 
  that is why i need someone to tell me what to read . 
  honestly i do n't see real difference between the two . 
  that is a very wise decision !, 
  we would n't let people to read anything . 
  an average adult person simply ca n't decide in such things . 
  we need to show them what to read !, 
  / s edit : look at the bbc ; according to them [ this ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e747/production/_91370295_mediaitem91370294.jpg ) is how orban looks like on an average day and based on the article you should think that he '' ... has closed hungary 's own southern borders with razor-wire fences and guard dogs '' because it was fun ( and not because the 1000 + migrants/day last summer ) . 
  but ofc bbc is credible and you do n't need a bullshit detector there . 
  come on !, 
  the hungarian [ kuvasz ] ( http://librariushu.rarecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kuvasz.jpg ) breed has the same problem because of the restricted genetic pool ( germans and soviets almost exterminated them in ww2 , poor dogs were too good guardians of the farms ) . 
  that 's all true and in this case they did nothing else than found an ambassador from a country which is committed to the promotion and protecting of human rights ( like minority rights ) to support their effort to change those rules . 
   and you should not be that interested either since it 's not the hungarian flag . 
  [ egy v\u00e9rb\u0151l val\u00f3k vagyunk/we be of one blood ] ( https://youtu.be/whw-k9epp-i ) it 's a hungarian thing and it 's not about borders or the territorial integrity of * romania . 
  i have never heard a transylvanian hungarian not even in hungary to questioning that . 
  yeah , it 's offtopic , but you wrote `` foreign '' several times , like :  i doubt people in us would be fine with foreign flags flying higher than the us flag or with mexican flags on us city halls etc. , so i just told that no , it 's not a hungarian flag from hungary . 
  anyway in hungary afaik you can use any flag you like as long as it not a nazi or soviet/communist flag . 
  if a mayor want to put a black pirate flag on the municipal building , he/she can . 
  if the locals do n't like it , they can elect a new mayor on the next election . 
  * see : [ romanian school in gyula , hungary ] ( https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g-w8j6h1pmk/vub3cfyu-ji/aaaaaaaable/gdub0fwgvhs/s1600/download.fcgi.jpg ) [ romanian school in battonya ] ( https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wquome91wls/vub4ab3rmli/aaaaaaaablq/qmh1atayhms/s1600/batania%2bscoala.jpg ), 
  still not a foreign flag . 
  edit : that 's all i said . 
  the hungarian flags are these : [ state flag - for the hungarian state ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/civil_ensign_of_hungary.svg/2000px-civil_ensign_of_hungary.svg.png ) - this flag on a building in romania means that our [ invasion has begun ] ( http://nemzetiosszetartozas.kormany.hu/download/9/e3/00000/zaszlo2.jpg ) . 
   [ national flag - for every hungarian in any country ] ( http://images.reblog.hu/uploads/blogs/2394/12463/post_12463_20101207222952.jpg ), 
  i am not a flag expert , but again , the szeklers are not foreign in romania since 1920 , so this whole debate is pointless , as that flag is not a hungarian flag . 
  it 's a flag used by the ethnic hungarian szeklers , who live in romania . 
  it 's also the flag of hargitha county , the same motives are in the official coat of arms of hargitha county and the flag was chosen by the szekler municipal rally in 2009 . 
  it 's not a hungarian flag , it 's a flag of an ethnic minority in romania . 
  ~ ~ you 're right about the us flags ~ ~ , but the szekler flag is not a foreign flag in romania , as it 's not a hungarian flag , but a flag used by the szekler minority in romania . 
  it was n't even known in hungary until it was banned in romania . 
  biztos csak a hal\u00e1l  discussion is a good thing , so why not ? 
  let 's speak about it and maybe we could achieve a greater understanding . 
  [ pic ] ( http://us24.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/9009174.jpg ) [ relevant quote ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/52/2c/40/522c4001d60f682aed8019e7e06bc491.jpg ), 
  be careful once they come over they will stay for 30 years . 
  the main problem that every car engines will remain with us for 20 or 30 years ( as the car makes it 's way from amsterdam to cisjordania ) . 
  it 's bit offtopic , but a czech site collected the worst engines years ago ( and a hungarian updated the list with their own observations ) and it 's just awful to look at any used car website to find cars with those horror engines advertised as great deal etc. 
  false . 
  if this video is true then salzburg was a hungarian town for centuries . 
  the habsburg empire consisted of cca . 
  12 hereditary provinces , of five lands under the bohemian crown and the lands of the hungarian crown ( with croatia , slavonia and transylvania ) and several duchies etc. 
  it was not a unified country with a unified government . 
  for example hungarian citizens were never considered austrian citizens and vice versa . 
  austria in 2015 : hungarians are nazis because they try to stop the refugees with a barbed wire fence . 
  austria in 2016 : the so european such liberal austrians create a 18 km long traffic jam on a schengen border almost every day because of those beloved refugees . 
  honestly austrians can go fuck themselves . 
  and i am not even an orban voter . 
  one layer of the fence costs cca . 
  $ 30 million . 
  it stops illegal immigrants . 
  the government can spend another $ 30 million on various assesments and reports made by friendly experts . 
  voters love it . 
  conclusion : hungary will look like a giant fence-onion by the time of the 2018 elections . 
   are those reichskommissariat troops ? 
  maybe , but i guess they are not us marines or the grenadier guards . 
   if i look at the context i am pretty sure that they are some anti-soviet , pro-german sort , and they were presented as an example for the contemporary anti-russian fighters .
