  happy anniversary !, 
  i 'd just like to add that is not a healthy thing if ukraine starts to [ glorify ] ( https://youtu.be/gtqcopon0_c?t=54s ) the reichskommissariat ukraine and the pro-german , pro-nazi ww2 fighters . 
  not the best heritage for a european ukraine & maidan ( or any country ) . 
  it 's just the contemporary russians obsession with stalin and ussr all over again . 
  just try to build a [ democracy ] ( https://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/46311616.jpg ) and stop glorfying communists and nazis . 
  ukrainians should be proud of the 4.5 million ukrainians , who joined the red army to fight nazi germany , and the more than 250,000 who served in soviet partisan units . 
  those people helped to defeat hitler . 
  this was taken years ago on an annual alumni meeting at the [ bib\u00f3 istv\u00e1n college for advanced studies ] ( http://bibo.elte.hu/galeria/kepgaleria/ ) , this is where the fidesz was founded , the current president , speaker of the house ( the two mustache guys , the third one is the chief foreign policy expert of the fidesz ) and the pm ( and their wives ) are all alumni of the college .

  the frightened person chaotically shuffles through his pockets and drops a paper . 
  a soldier picks it up and reads slowly , with difficulty : `` yurine analysis '' ... hmm ... a foreigner , sounds like ... a spy , looks like ... let 's shoot him on the spot ! '', 
  then reads further : `` proteins : none , sugars : none , fats : none ... you are free to go , comrade !,

  this is the hungarian [ pronunciation ] ( http://data.whicdn.com/images/144713593/large.gif ) of the word . 
  possibly comes from an old norse word . 
  well , as you started to blame everything orban does on `` hungary '' ( really ? 
  used a caps at turkey and russia , but `` hungary '' ? ), 
  my answer is : because you are a romanian just like basescu . 
  stephen and his father , geza . 
  they were charismatic leaders ( the blood of arpad that is they were the descendants of arpad ) and they started to create a centralized christian kingdom after 955 . 
  they were cruel and merciless and the majority of the population followed them . 
  but it was n't smooth , after stephen died and appointed an heir from outside the arpad dinasty , this ( and another uprising in the 1060s ) happened : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/vata_pagan_uprising, 
   it 's nice of hungary to be first to keep doors open for dictators http://www.business-review.eu/news/romania-must-enter-talks-with-moscow-on-union-with-moldova-says-basescu-115653 - i guess the dictator and door opening labels are highly depending on the circumstances , amiright ? 
    hungary pretends to be very alarmed by muslims http://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-defence/news/minister-of-defence-visits-hungarian-contingent-serving-in-iraq  how do the mental gymnastics work ? 
  we will never disclose that to a romanian , but nice try . 
  `` erdogan : mr. szijjarto . 
  this is an unexpected pleasure .

  erdogan : i assure you , mr. szijjarto , my men are working as fast they can . 
  szijjarto : perhaps i can find new ways to motivate them . 
  erdogan : i tell you that the turkish government will be operational as planned . 
  szijjarto : the prime minister does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation . 
  erdogan : but he asks the impossible !, 
  i need more men !, 
  szijjarto : then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives . 
  erdogan : orban 's coming here ? 
  szijjarto : that is correct , president , and he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress . '', 
  translation of the main part from origo.hu : `` according to origo 's sources fm peter szijjarto travels to ankara on tuesday . 
  the minister of foreign affairs and foreign economic relations is the first high-ranking european politicians who travels to turkey since the attempted n july . 
  he prepares the visit of pm viktor orb\u00e1n . 
  ( ... ) the hungarian fm then travels to egypt on wednesday ( ... ) . '', 
  also : he will prepare the planned autumn ankara visit ( negotiations about the possibilities of economic cooperation between the two countries , also will discuss other topics such as the agreement between the european union and turkey ) of prime minister viktor orb\u00e1n as well . 
  ( ... recep tayyip erdogan would have visit planned to hungary szigetv\u00e1r siege 450th anniversary , but he wo n't be able to attend the ceremony . ), 
  the other parts of the article are just brief recaps about turkey and the situation there . 
   for a nature lover , romania has more to offer that 's true , a bear in a hungarian forest is evening news category . 
   i hope you will enjoy your time here .

  i would n't say that .

  i know it 's annoying to answer with a quote , but : '' ... the nato deterrent promise has never revolved around a commitment to defeat soviet/russian forces on nato 's borders . 
  instead , nato has backed its political commitment with the threat to broaden any conflict beyond the war that the soviets wanted to fight . '',

  the tradition with the bouquets is really touching . 
  i realized how great was the cost of the ww1 for france when i read about the red zone around the former frontline . 
  that 's a great tradition with the fire pit reviving . 
  great monument . 
  that was maybe because of the cow and chicken cartoons . 
  it will be true on the day when quantity will become quality , just as it has been foretold by some great russians . 
  that whole scandal was something totally unexpected for me back then . 
  i did n't know that urine container + fake penis is a thing until that day . 
  ofc it 's possible , but i doubt that as much athletes need a drug to prevent [ ischemia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ischemia ) and such ( for example the russians replaced the whole u18 hockey team because of this drug . ) . 
  [ meldonium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meldonium ) helps `` to increase the blood flow as well as increase the flow of oxygen throughout the body '' which is not bad if you are a professional athlete . 
  look at the list of the affected athletes on wiki , i doubt that they all have such heart problems . 
  so , sometimes athletes need to be banned . 
  anyway it still not as bad as my compatriot [ adrian annus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adri%c3%a1n_annus ) with his urine container , fake penis and escape from athens in 2004 . 
  let 's everyone post pictures about similar memorials from their country . 
  in budapest , hungary the [ memorial stone of the heroes ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/2475076.jpg ) ( inscription reads : `` in memory of our heroes '' ) is on the [ heroes ' square ] ( http://welovebudapest.com/image/hosok.3.exact726w.jpg?v=3 ) which square is located on the end of the [ andrassy avenue ] ( http://nyugat-fordito.hu/images/15.jpg ) . 
  the idea of a memorial stone was first brought up by major ferenc abele in a letter to pm istvan tisza in 1915 . 
  king charles iv signed a bill in 1917 which ordered every settlement in the county to erect a stone monument for the fallen heroes of the great war . 
  the central monument on the heroes square was finished in 1929 ( with inscriptions `` 1914-18 '' and `` for the thousand years old borders . '' ), 
  this memorial was removed from the square in 1951 and a new one was erected there in 1956 with the inscription `` for our heroes who gave their life for the freedom of our people and our national independence '' . 
  the third monument was unveiled in 2001 august 20 .

  it 's totally possible as they do n't know how much time it needs to clear out and most of the athletes who produced a positive sample use this as a defense . 
  this is the same drug with which sharapova tested positive in march .

  it could work as the gas costs only cca .

  $ 3 cheaper . 
  by the way i really appreciate the usage of `` nagyv\u00e1rad '' . 
  good marketing . 
  it 's rather common here with unpopular topics like russia or if you post something which goes against the popular views on r/europe . 
  that 's a good deal then .
