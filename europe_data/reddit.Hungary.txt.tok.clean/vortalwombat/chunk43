  to tell the truth reagan did a lot and he is still one of the most popular us presidents in hungary . 
  we even have a [ reagan statue ] ( http://m.cdn.blog.hu/la/lacitoday/image/55172601.jpg ) in budapest , near the [ harry hill bandholtz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harry_hill_bandholtz ) statue . 
  and ofc statements like `` the hungarian freedom fighters of 1956 perished or suffered exile , but their sacrifice lives on in the memory of the hungarian people . 
  their example lives on as well , for we see brave people - we call them freedom fighters too - in genuine popular revolutions against communist oppression around the world . 
  let us honor the hungarian freedom fighters of 1956 with renewed dedication to our own freedom and with continued assistance for those who follow in their footsteps today . '', 
  are always good to hear .

   romanians being stopped on the motorway by gypsies and robbed/carjacked . 
  that 's not the same . 
  in those cases they sign you to stop because your tyre is flat or something like that and they even stop to help and grab things from the backseat , while you are checking your tyre . 
  i did n't know this trick is still in use . 
   but many are going to germany to buy cars oh yes and the bulgarians . 
  empty trailers toward austria , with 2 or even 3 old cars on their way back . 
  it 's the great car migration from germany to hungary , romania and bulgaria . 
  what i saw was not a risky overtaking . 
  the romanian guy wanted to teach a lesson and almost hit the scooter with the right back corner of the lorry . 
  the scooter had to leave the pavement to stop safely . 
  regarding the bad driving part : at least in hungary yes , romanian drivers are more agressive than the italians ( or anyone else except the germans ) both on the mo , m1 , m5 and route 4 . 
  it 's almost looks like they are convinced that they are driving on enemy territory , however most of the hungarians just does n't care the romanians . 
  and a personal memory : a romanian lorry driver once stopped in the middle of the exit lane of m7 to ask me ( and 3 other car before me ) for directions and bottled up the traffic for minutes . 
  i am convinced that he thought i wanted to rob him when i asked him in english to leave the motorway and i would help him after that , because he did n't stop , just drive away in a wrong direction . 
  bullying looks fairly harmless from the outside most of the time . 
  few years ago my nephew had complained for months that he was bullied at school . 
  his parents talked with the teachers , who all rejected all complaints . 
  on the last day of the year he was badly beaten and it became a police case for the attackers . 
  if there is a complaint it 's never harmless . 
  that 's unlikely . 
  they first need to beat france and switzerland for that as he is a romanian .

  maybe i will be downvoted for this , but everything is balkan there ( except greece ) which was not part of austria-hungary in cca . 
  and former slovakians . 
  it 's the same with the romanians . 
  three weeks ago a romanian lorry driver almost killed a guy on a scooter in front of me , outside of buda\u00f6rs , when he steered the lorry on the scooter after he overtook it . 
  poor guy somehow was able to stop on the roadside . 
  but i am not sure it 's an ethnically charged thing , maybe it 's just the last drop on that day . 
  i once saw an accident on route 4 , which happened because of such road rage , a driver wanted to teach a lesson for a truck driver , both hungarians . 
  i did n't know that . 
  that 's bad . 
  serious question : is n't other nations ' opinion too important for the romanians ? 
  if yes then * it 's not a good thing . 
  in hungary [ mikl\u00f3s zrinyi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikl%c3%b3s_zr%c3%adnyi ) closed this subject in the 17th century : `` we are not inferior to any other nation . '', 
  period . 
  maybe romanians should accept that they are just as good as any other europeans and forget this romani people-romania bullshit . 
  it 's indeed beautiful . 
  you 're welcome .

  a similar program was started last year for hungarians in vojvodina , serbia ... * muhaha *, 
  translation : hungarians in carpatho-ukraine will get 5.2 billion huf next year for economic development . 
  first tenders will be opened in the summer in transcarpathia 's economic development program , with the following priorities : development of tourism , increase of agricultural production , and strengthen of local small and medium-sized enterprises . 
  istvan grezsa , government commissioner responsible for the area ( i.e cross-border economic development ) said that the payments can start from this september . 
  this year the program will work with 2 billion huf ( $ 6.3 million ) from the budget and with 20 billion huf ( $ 63.5 million ) from [ eximbank ] ( http://exim.hu/en/eximrol/ ) credits , in 2017 the program planned budgetary needs will be huf 5.2 billion ( $ 16.5 million ) . 
  the ede egan-plan based development program would be finished in 2018 , with the final cost of 12 billion huf ( $ 38 million ) and 20 billion huf ( $ 63.5 million ) . 
  in addition to the association of the transcarpathian hungarians ' political organizations , the historical churches will be also strategic partners of the government , so its representatives can participate in the evaluation phase of the proposals . 
  now they are working on conditions which may legitimately provide an opportunity to minimize the taxation of the aid by the ukrainian government . 
  ( ede egan [ wiki in hu ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/eg%c3%a1n_ede ) was an agricultural expert , who was sent to carpatho-ukraine by the hungarian government in 1897 to combat poverty there and was killed by an assassin hired by local loan sharks * in 1901 . ), 
  both . 
  no , but i voted on the national elections and eu elections . 
  honestly i would n't like to vote about everything like they do in switzerland , that is why i have representatives . 
   this is especially true in eastern europe where ton of companies do work `` under table '' or by people without certificates that do multiple jobs usually written later as one job which simply ca n't happern in eu funded project . 
  not when public money is involved , though . 
  in hungary usually everything is okay on paper , from bills to health insurance for the workers , everything . 
  the only under the table thing is where the `` kickback '' happens . 
  what is even worse , that the kickback part in hungary happens at the highest possible levels since 2010 , lower level corruption is marginal . 
  if the hungarians would elect ( or would be able to find ) honest politicians and government ( or an attorney general , who is not a former member of orban 's fidesz ) , corruption could be eliminated in weeks . 
  well , if you want to leave because of this , it 's too late . 
  by 2020 the eu supported development programs will be stopped in hungary because of the development level of the country .
