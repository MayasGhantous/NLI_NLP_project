  nationalism is not more widespread in hungary than in anywhere in europe . 
  to tell the truth if you put a national flag on your house , most of your neighbors will consider you a wild nationalist in hungary . 
  the jobbik has cca . 
  900k voters , but that is all of the extremist or nationalist voters . 
  at least we do n't have such people in every party from the left to the right like in romania . 
  for most of the hungarians trianon means that we have millions of hungarians in other countries , with whom we share common heritage and customs and we have to defend their rights , as they are the same hungarians as us , only we are separated by borders . 
  i understand that you 're a half-hungarian , maybe you should try to listen to the hungarian side as well in historical and other questions , but to tell the truth the self-hating of the assimilated minority is not a novelty . 
  well , it 's also typically stupid to grab one sentence from a longer answer , but many hungarians are aware that we only had a finite budget and there is no `` governmental '' money , but only taxpayers ' money . 
  we do n't have oil , gas etc. 
  thanks , that 's fascinating . 
  there are gender changing operations in hungary and afaik from tv talk shows ( the mary was a boy , but she felt all in her life ... type segments ) and such sources it is supported by the national healthcare insurance . 
  but seriously , after a gender changing process is it possible to have children without serious medical assistance ? 
  but there is always one , even if the topic is pancakes or unicorns . 
  thank you for showing up here and for not missing a chance to say something bad about hungary . 
  seriously what 's wrong with the romanians ? 
  are you thinking about hungary all day long ? 
   hungarians hate anyone interfering with them . 
  they build walls , hate the eu and hate immigrants . 
  sadly your knowledge on hungary is based on stereotypes . 
  migrants became the backbone of the government 's propaganda ( planned by arthur j. finkelstein ) , but there is a great support for migrants in hungary on the side of various ngos and simple citizens . 
  ofc no one wanted to allow them to enter hungary without proper procedures , as we are not idiots to allow persons to enter our country without any identification and such . 
  but if you look at various surveys you can see that the hungarian society is not against the migrants . 
  only the links which would prove this are usually downvoted on r/europe .

  actually it is you who seems a bit insecure . 
  you should try to be a bit less nationalist and try to judge people based on their personality and merits and not on their ethnicity . 
  well , although this penis size hysteria on the romanian side is the rock bottom here , but genetically the hungarian population is very close to the austrians actually . 
  romanians are much closer to the balkan . 
  just google `` genetic map of europe '' . 
  this `` very distinct '' thing is a nationalistic bullshit . 
  edit : do n't need to search u/leeview already linked one . 
  bit is also a big player in hungary and we have a great subtitle writer community , but it 's jose luis !, 
  the government replaced one type of the pensions with two subsidies and medical committees checked the pensioners ( iirc everyone under 79 % disability ) . 
  first the government talked about very huge numbers , but it turned out that there were less pensioners than they anticipated and there were ugly cases where really disabled persons lost their pensions , but without a serious opposition and with the supermajority no one could stop the government . 
  some sources : 2011-05-17 : http://bbj.hu/politics/hungary-to-review-220000-disability-pensions_57838 2011-07-04 : http://bbj.hu/life/disability-pensioners-could-have-their-benefits-repealed_58704 2011-11-21 : http://bbj.hu/politics/govt-submits-bill-restructuring-disability-pensions_61505 http://www.enil.eu/news/disability-watchdog/disability-watchdog-update-on-current-events-in-hungary/, 
  that 's true , but you ca n't force people to learn . 
  1.4 million hungarians had a uk social security number in 2014 , i guess they speak english , despite the dubbing . 
  also louis de funes , bud spencer and terence hill and many more non-english actors would have never become such a big stars in hungary without dubbing . 
  edit : i forgot to mention torrente . 
  it became popular in hungary thanks to the dubbing . 
  yes , this is also a popular argument in hungary against dubbing , but one can always choose what to watch . 
  same in hungary . 
  because it 's much more convenient to watch a dubbed movie , and it 's more entertaining . 
  after all watching movies is about entertaining and not about learning languages ( also you can always choose a subtitle version ) . 
  this problem solved in hungary by centralized medical checks for these `` disabled pensions '' and by reforming the system . 
  there were 200k such pensioner in 2011 and until 2012 40k were checked and 11k were lost their pension ( i do n't find more recent data now , but it 's enough to show the phenomena ) . 
  but it was n't a popular or easy task and the orban government had a supermajority and a weak opposition . 
  one of the best scenes is the nuclear button . 
  however you rang m ` lord and allo allo were much more popular in hungary . 
  it 's only because they are a security risk . 
  it does n't mean that they are terrorists , it only means that there is a greater risk that they are terrorists , than in the case of estonia , for example . 
  it 's hard to find estonian terrorists these days . 
  i feel a certain disturbance in the thread . 
  afaik bidet is not a substitute for wiping . 
  well , moldova 's missing $ 1bn sparked protests there , in hungary it 's just the usual yearly $ 1bn scandal , like in the [ last year ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30d6nb/hungary_pm_orban_and_the_brokerage_scandal_of_the/ ) . 
  it 's not a rarity , but not because of the ottomans ( they did n't influenced hungary that greatly and they were badly beaten 330 years ago ) . 
  it 's easy to install if you build a new house or renovate your bathroom and it increases the value of the property . 
  ofc it 's not that easy to install in older and smaller apartements in block houses , where the toilet is usually not in the bathroom but in a separate 1.5 mx1 .5 m room ( although there are bidet attachments ) , but in houses and flats built after the 1990s it 's more frequent . 
  the british empire won the desert war with proper shitting . 
  source : [ hygiene aspects of the el alamein victory , 1942 ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2283807/pdf/brmedj03930-0003.pdf ) published in the british medical journal in 1944 . 
  it 's possible . 
  1.4 million hungarians had national insurance number in the uk in 2014 and more than 1 million of them payed insurance there . 
  ( borneo and celebes were and will be hungarian . ), 
  ( there is no weed on the side of the trench , moscow will become a hungarian village . ), 
  that is the sign of a real good joke . 
  like when the lumberjack cut down the other lumberjack 's arm in the forest ; `` look mate , is this serious or a joke ? 
  - serious . 
  - ok , it would have been too mean for a joke . '', 
  hungary is not in this video , but we have a better one ( luckily with english subs ) : [ captain pannonia - the carpathian soldier ] ( https://youtu.be/kjirdqyv6vm ), 
   anglicizing names is annoying at least everybody can pronounce it . 
   but it works the other way as well , for example queen elizabeth is erzs\u00e9bet kir\u00e1lyn\u0151 in hungary or juan carlos is j\u00e1nos k\u00e1roly . 
  i call it sausage as i do n't know better name for them in english . 
   in hungarian the blood and liver sausage is called hurka ( v\u00e9reshurka and m\u00e1jashurka ) and the normal sausage is the kolb\u00e1sz . 
  the usage of breadrools , rice or barley in the mix depends only on the local customs . 
  i did n't know that about bentham , but that 's a unique way to rest in peace . 
  they can protest and organize a boycott , that 's all . 
  when the danone wanted to close the most prestigious biscuit factory of the country cca . 
  10 years ago in gyor there was a nationwide boycott . 
  the danone told that they give up the plan , but they closed the factory a little later and moved the production to poland . 
  i do n't know for sure but i ca n't find it anywhere . 
  i guess everbody is afraid of a possible food safety inspection , there are too many risks for a blood product . 
  one bad air conditioner or refrigerator anywhere from the plant to the shops in hot weather and they could easily get a $ 10000 fine . 
  so you can buy a [ normal sausage ] ( http://www.foodandwine.hu/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/20100127_11.jpg ) or a [ liver sausage ] ( http://grocceni.com/kep/majashurka2.jpg ) , but not blood sausage . 
  it is . 
  in [ ny\u00edrb\u00e1tor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ny%c3%adrb%c3%a1tor ) , in the [ castle ] ( http://karpat-medence.hu/keptar/galleries/magyarorszag/szabolcs/nyirbator/bathory-kastely/nyirbator-bathory-kastely_02.jpg ) of the b\u00e1thoris . 
  according to [ elizabeth b\u00e1thory ] ( http://zaol.hu/data/cikk/142/6722/cikk_1426722/0.jpg ) it 's not . 
  well , the company went bankrupt a few months ago and the new bff of viktor orb\u00e1n , [ l\u0151rinc m\u00e9sz\u00e1ros ] ( http://hungarianspectrum.org/2014/12/14/lorinc-meszaros-friend-of-viktor-orban-is-a-financial-genius/ ) ( who became a billionaire since orban won the election in 2010 ) is trying to buy what remained from the plant . 
  so if a healthy fine from the government could help mr. m\u00e9sz\u00e1ros to buy low , there will be an enormous fine , but if it could not help , there will be nothing . 
  not in the summer .
