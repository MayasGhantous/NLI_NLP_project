  you ca n't buy blood sausage in the summer in hungary . 
  yes , it flowed from the bakony to the balaton through tapolca , raposka , hegymagas and szigliget , but bauxit mining ruined it , so today it flows into its former side-stream ( afaik ) . 
  you did n't heard about how the a joint-venture of the australian company esmeralda exploration and the romanian government almost killed off the river tisza ? 
  after all it mostly flows in hungary , i guess it 's not your problem . 
  those people drowned in a poisonous mud-flood in minutes , because of an accident . 
  many more of them burned because of the chemicals . 
  the village was destroyed . 
  however the spill was largely neutralized before it reached the danube , not like in 2000 at the tisza , when a romanian mining company almost destroyed the whole river . 
  i guess you would n't be happy if i crack jokes about that disco-fire which happened in bucharest last year , but i wo n't , because that 's not funny . 
  it 's quite strange if it 's funny for you . 
  edit : [ here ] ( http://ocdn.eu/images/pulscms/ztk7mdysmze0ldfiyw__/20d3fb2c8b2ab414786025ad06523f51.jpg ) is the grave of the 14 months old girl , who drawned in her cradle . 
  her 3 years old sister badly burned by the chemicals . 
  have fun with your `` fa haz de necaz '' . 
  well , if it makes their miserable lives better ... 
  it 's a great place to hide . 
  if the mediterranean sea can be ocean , then the danube can be too . 
  brief translation : the president delivered the message of soros : they will never leave budapest . 
  plans have been developed in order to secure the future of learning , teaching and research - wrote the president of ceu for the citizens of the university : in addition to the projects and institutions , soros is also committed to stay in the hungarian capital . 
  in the nador street they are waiting for the decision of janos ader . 
  we got the letter , which was sent on monday by president and rector michael ignatieff and by vice-rector liviu matei to to the university students , teachers , researchers and staff of the central european university . 
  first , they thanked them for all `` the dignity , determination , discipline and efficiency that they showed in these trying times for our university . '', 
  `` we would like to emphasize that nothing jeopardizes the existence of the ceu '' ( ... ) `` we face political threats , but the university will continue to operate under any circumstances '' ( ... ) . 
  `` today is a day of particular significance as we will soon learn how janos ader will decide . '', 
  - continues the rector of the university ( ... ) `` depending on the decision we will immediately begin a legal action in hungary and europe , and we will look for a short term and a long-term solution '' ( ... ) `` the ceu does not give up hope to find a negotiated solution for the future of the institution and to guarantee its independence . '', 
  ( ... ) `` many people are worried about what the future may bring , but we want to assure everyone that the board of directors and founder is committed to continue academic work '' ( ... ) `` we have developed our plans for any case , we will be able to ensure the future of learning , teaching and research . '', 
  ( ... ) `` we want to create a perfectly clear situation : budapest is our home , and we will not leave our base whatever happens . 
  it does not matter what lies ahead , this will always be true . '' ( ... ), 
  `` the highest ratios of government debt to gdp at the end of the third quarter of 2016 were recorded in greece ( 176.9 % ) , portugal ( 133.4 % ) and italy ( 132.7 % ) , and the lowest in estonia ( 9.6 % ) , luxembourg ( 21.5 % ) and bulgaria ( 28.7 % ) . '', 
  `` compared with the third quarter of 2015 , eleven member states registered an increase in their debt to gdp ratio at the end of the third quarter of 2016 and seventeen a decrease . 
  the highest increases in the ratio were recorded in greece ( +4.4 pp ) , lithuania ( +3.1 pp ) , portugal ( +2.9 pp ) and bulgaria ( +2.1 pp ) , while the largest decreases were recorded in ireland ( -8.5 pp ) , the netherlands ( -4.3 pp ) and hungary ( -3.2 pp ) . '', 
  in january the hungarian general directorate of water management sent the icebrakers szechenyi , icebraker xi , icebraker vi and icebraker vii boats ( yep , perfect names ) on request to help the serbian and croatian authorities on the danube to open a 80-100 metres wide channel in the ice .

  please try to keep the color-line in turning . 
  nope mate , but if you prefer that ... 
  i would not say that . 
  hungary has many more to offer than budapest and we have some really beautiful landscape , national parks etc.

  well , maybe . 
  after all we screwed slavs so hard for such a long time ... 
  that is just so wrong on so many levels and so not true and so propagandistic nationalistic bullshit ... 
  your sweet auntie in vladivostok would n't be proud of this . 
  for example the hungarian campaigns in europe were always organized on tribal and not a national level . 
  some tribes were german some other were balkan specialists . 
  so one defeat did not kill everyone , only signalled to others that it 's not easy to pillage that part anymore . 
  i am a barbarian and i really lost my patience because of your long post . 
  now i need to go to kill my neighbors , looting their villages and feast until midnight . 
  your sweet auntie in vladivostok maybe a slav , but hungarians are not . 
  in this form this church was built in the 19th century iirc . 
  it was stolen for the people , not by the people . 
  i did not know that my government have to provide me dates , but i will check . 
  how does it work , with vouchers and the random girls i choose obliged to accept them or with some kind of a governmental webpage , like hotdates.gov.hu ? 
  a german head of state and a hungarian pm , that would be fun . 
  as one of the two non-romanians and the only hungarian in this very interesting post : boo !, 
  the usual translation for `` t\u00far\u00f3 '' is cottage cheese , but if i need to describe it i would say it 's like a ricotta made out of cow milk . 
  i hope it helped . 
  ( and it 's much drier than the creamy , fat variants like the czech/slovak tvaroh ) *, 
  it 's acceptable , but in lecs\u00f3 and goulash there are as many correct recipes as hungarians , so ... , 
  we need to be cautious . 
  anything better than this would enrage the gods . 
  oh , f1 after sunday lunch is one of the best amongst the european traditions . 
  one important update : the cottage cheese is on the noodles , not on the chicken . 
  that would n't be appropriate . 
  sure , buddy , sure . 
  i can see one thing from this post and the comments : romanians still not feel safe . 
  may god bless romania real hard and deep !, 
  csehorszag , that is czechland . 
  hungarians are logical . 
  live long and prosper !, 
  well , `` az allam a javadat akarja , ne add neki oda ! '', 
  it was widely called pest-buda or buda-pest since the 18th century . 
  i have just one question : https://youtu.be/duqevg5iqae, 
  and imagine they are unable to find enough postman . 
  i always imagined what is hell for a romanian more like [ this ] ( http://mork.rangado.hu/scopes/rangado2015/var//improxy/rangadowxgapicture/14/34/143408_magyar_szurkolok.jpg ) . 
  why did you do that , you fool ? 
  he warned us not to ask !, 
  we are all doomed !, 
   big players such as spain ... 
  i guess spanish redditors are now in love with you . 
  sometimes i find myself struggling with even english and now we have a plenty of russian , german etc.

  disappointing . 
  ** the country of misery : half of the taxpayers below the poverty line ** - [ nol.hu ] ( http://nol.hu/gazdasag/munkaalapu-szegenyseg-1515131 ) the division of our society is more and more prominent . 
  the personal income tax data show that the number of higher and lower-income citizens are both increase , but the gap between them is steadily widening . 
  the increase in income is a positive trend , but overall the developing process is not healthy , ( ... ) we examined the gross income in several income bands between 2006 and 2013 . 
  this interval is included the financial crisis and its immediate impact , as well as a significant one-time minimum wage increase due to the abolition of the tax credit . 
  the calculation shows the status of the income tax payers , rather than the status of the society as a whole : it shows 4.2-4 .4 million people income situation on the basis of gross wages . 
  it is definitely positive that the largest is the tax bracket of between 6500 and 13,000 euros , which also includes the ** gross average wage ** , which was 560 euros monthly or ** 6720 euros annual ** in 2013 . 
  ( ... ) the annual average wage in 2013 was just slipped over 6500 euros , maybe that explains why this band had a significant ( 50,000 taxpayers ) expansion : 1,042,000 people belonged here . 
  this number is not expected to rise in the future , since the average wage remains in this band for a long time . 
  the highest band over 13,000 euros continued to increase , in 2013 there were 430,000 people -- however there is ** only 187,000 people ** who ** earned more than 19,500 euros annually ** . 
  in addition to these two categories there was an expansion in the lowest one . 
  the ** income of less than 1600 euros per year ** means temporary , casual or public works employment and includes those whose employment is generated only at the beginning or at the end of the year . 
  here , unfortunately , the ** expansion ** was quite ** dynamic and continuous ** : 568,000 to 742,000 since 2008 - with an uptick in 2011 , but it was because of technical reasons . 
  ** after 2008 tens of thousands of taxpayers landed here from upper categories and this process looks unstoppable now ** . ( ... ),
