  there is not much joy in the data as it shows there is ** more than 2,000,000 taxpayers live below the poverty line . 
  this is ** the lowest three income bands , and ** the half of the hungarian taxpayers ** . ( ... ), 
  in 2013 a total of 2,782,000 taxpayers earned below the national average wage . 
  the average of the wages is far from the average wage of the employees . 
  the income is clearly concentrated in the upper lanes , the top ten percent ( 430,000 people ) gained the 36 percent of the total income in 2013 , and the lower band of 740,000 people gained less than two percent . 
  lajos simicska talks about his childhood to the reporter . 
  he grown up in a poor worker family , his father was ruined both mentally and phisically by the communists because of his role in the revolution of 1956 . 
  simicska refused to join the pioneers in elementary school and the university rejected his application two times . 
  before the university he was drafted to the army . 
  he served in the town of zalaegerszeg with orban . 
  one day he was summoned to his commander who showed the intelligence files about simicska to him and told that simicska should be more cautious if he wanted to go to the univesity . 
  ** '' ... any more details from the reports ? 
  there was a guy , however , who came over and told me `` listen , lajos , the fact is that i have to report you . '', 
  i said to him : no hard feelings , good that you told me , we will figure out together what you should write . 
  i think , on their own , it has been discovered who he was . 
  ** yes . 
  after we were discharged , we were in a restaurant as civilians , orban was taken ( by the police ) . 
  we went home by train without viktor . 
  after discharge every soldier goes to a party , so did we , then there he was suddenly reappeared . 
  `` well , what are you doing here ? '', 
  he said they wanted to recruit him as an informant , but he said no . 
  i have beleive that for 30 years . 
  ** but no longer ? 
  ** i do not know what to think now . 
  ** did you asked for the reports about you ? 
  ** i tried . 
  they know nothing about me . 
  it 's just strange because i have seen with my own eyes the file at the age of 22 , and heard with my own ears the reports about me from major pallos ' mouth . 
  ** many files disappeared in the regime change ... ** ( i.e. 
  the fall the of communism ) at budapest , yes . 
  but there is another city where you could find them . 
  ** moscow ? 
  ** exactly . 
  ** are you saying that the russians have the pm reports there and putin blackmailing him ? 
  ** if those reports re-emerge , that would be a game changer . 
  that 's for sure . 
  and i , after the events of the past year , i do not know what to think . 
  ** that scarier than death , if i will be crippled ** ( - [ index.hu ] ( http://index.hu/kulfold/2015/03/12/karpatalja_magyar_katonak_sorozas/ ) written by gergely nyilas ) those who went through the debaltseve cauldron , no longer can trust in the poorly equipped ukrainian army 's success . 
  many transcarpathians served on the eastern ukrainian front , the local hungarian community have four dead members already . 
  the number of victims could be much higher , however , because after their escape from the cauldron hundreds of soldiers are still missing . 
  we spoke with young hungarians returned from the fight . 
  it was called officially a withdrawal , but it was actually an escape how the ukrainian army got out from debaltseve . 
  the town lying between donetsk and lugansk is an important railway junction - the city 's russian name is debaltsevo - now held by the pro-russian insurgents . 
  the 128th mukacheve brigade got encircled in the cauldron with many transcarpathian hungarians served in the unit . 
  those who survived the fighting , now just waiting for their contract to expire and then they will look after civilian jobs . 
  ** the debaltseve matryoshka ** ** `` we were encircled , we knew that accurately . 
  in kiev of course , they did not tell that to the people '' ** - we talk with istvan at a gate of a transcarpathian village 's cemetery , not at his home , because that is a secret where he lives . 
  his three-year contract was due to expire in october last year , but due to the conflict in eastern ukraine it was automatically extended for one year . 
  this was the case with all professional soldiers who were to discharge over the past 11 months . 
  in debaltseve the situation was more complicated than a simple encirclement : the center was held by the separatists , around them a wider ring of the ukrainian army , which , however , is completely surrounded by the donetsk separatists . 
  and the russian military . 
  as istvan says : ** `` we have seen even the russian 's planes above , but there were their tanks either , constantly attacking our positions . 
  the separatists used cluster bombs also . 
  '' ** ** putin sent a message from budapest ** the 23-year-old istvan learned to be a car mechanic , but in the hope of steady job he became a professional soldier . 
  of course , back in october 2011 , just a few people was thinking that there would be a real war . 
  thus , the 1800 grivnas salary -- it worth 143 euros three years ago - was attractive . 
  it worth roughly 60 euros now . 
  however , on the front this had been doubled , and then it almost doubled again , so sometimes they were payed 7000 grivnas , that means an almost 235 euros payment for soldiers exposed to artillery fire . 
  istvan spent nearly three months in the cauldron , where the weapons did not cease firing after the cease-fire agreement of minsk on 15 february . 
  the russian president essentially sent a message from budapest , that if the ukrainian forces retreat without their weapons , then the separatist forces will let them retreat . 
  ( he did not mention other forces , because moscow denies the presence of its soldiers in the area , despite the shocking interview in the [ novaya gazeta ] ( http://www.novayagazeta.ru/society/67490.html ) with a wounded russian tankist . ), 
  istvan said the following about how putin kept his word : ** `` the ceasefire has lived not more than three hours , then they already started firing their missiles . 
  but we did not think that we should surrender . 
  '' ** ** the enemy 's hinterland ** legally kiev protects its own sovereign territory in eastern ukraine , but the soldiers had a different experience : most locals who did not fled consider the ukrainian forces enemy . 
  ** `` our cars often pelted with stones , as we drove through towns . 
  or when we went to one of the wells , we got in a firefight because locals informed the separatist gunmen that we were there . 
  '' ** according to istvan it is the responsibility of the russian state tv , which everyone looked in the east because moscow aligned the local population against kiev . 
  ** `` but they still came to us to ask for food , we gave them what we had . 
  not water , we did not have that either . 
  '' ** - as istvan continued , we found out it was not because of the war , but simply water pipe was not even routed to the military base . 
  however , the possibilities of the army made the circumstances worse . 
  contracted soldiers and draftees got winter and summer uniforms once a year , boots and jackets in every three years . 
  this is not enough , so everyone is forced to purchase these items on their own . 
  the dress costs 2500 grivnas , its the one and a half months peacetime salary of a soldier . 
  ** `` the downsizing of the ukrainian military had been continious for many years , like the elimination of the compulsory military service , the disappearance of our heavy equipments . 
  i think putin has long planned to wage war against the weakening ukraine , and the protests then gave him the opportunity . 
  '' ** istvan told us that however there was no shortage in handguns and ammunition . 
  in all other areas the war was extremely unequal against the russian and separatist forces . 
  ** surviving in a pond ** the ukrainian forces basically stayed in their defensive positions , they were rarely attacking the separatists . 
  still , they gave up important defensive positions easier than they should , ** `` at uglegorsk there was a good fortified hill . 
  we gave that up , and from there the separatists could controll whole debaltseve . 
  '' ** istvan realized how vulnerable the position of the ukrainian forces in debaltseve when he was ordered to transfer a kraz truck from an other army base.he was on his way back in the nine-meter-long , 21-ton truck on the road when he ran into missile and mortar fire . 
  ** `` as soon as i heard the incoming fire , i opened the door and i was barely able to jump into a water-filled pit . 
  it was not pleasant . 
  the truck and the area of residential houses was destroyed by the barrage . 
  '' ** istvan told us it was not the ukrainian forces who fired . 
  the separatists and the ukrainian army pointing at each other in connection with the attacks on the homes of civilians and both parties deny the responsibility . 
  according to istvan , if an enemy unit hiding among the houses , like in a converted city bus with a hidden mortar , the ukrainian army sent in a specialist team and did not used heavy artillery threatening the homes and properities of civilians . 
  istvan does not heard that the ukrainian national guard volunteer units did it elsehow . 
  according to him , they did not coordinate everything exactly , but they always made known their movements and actions to each other to avoid friendly fire . 
  thus , it is only sure that there were attacks against civilians on both sides , somewhere against houses -- like in mariupol , debaltseve , kramatorsk , gorlovka , pesko , lugansk and somewhere against intercity buses like in volnovaha or against urban trolleys like in donetsk . 
  the ukrainian soldiers were constantly before the eyes of the enemy . 
  istvan was also engaged in construction works on entrenchments beside patrolling . 
  ** `` i was in the night shifts , we worked with the heavy machinery without the headlights on in total darkness . 
  when we flashed some light , we were immediately fired upon . 
  i do not smoke , but most of the soldiers do , but at night they did not even lit it if they were on duty in order to avoid to become a target . 
  '' ** - told us istvan as he gave an other aspect of consequences of smoking on health . 
  ** just not taken by the separatists !, 
  ** the population tried to escape from the city more or less controlled by ukrainian forces until mid-february , but still many people remained in their hiding places . 
  ** `` in january , there were three days when the ceasefire was broadly respected .
