  many buses left back then , mainly with children . 
  but there were people who left by tractor or by any means possible . 
  the rusians also observed the cease-fire , but the separatists did not . 
  '' ** - told us istvan , who also admitted that there was one thing that the ukrainian soldiers wanted to avoid at all costs : to being captured by the separatists . 
  it was much safer to being captured by the russians : ** `` i know a guy , who being fed , had a shower and returned by the russians intact . 
  the separatists , however , do not spare the prisoners . 
  many of them are mercenaries , who are there to murder people . 
  '' ** there is no doubt about that as the separatists themselves admit : they are just forgiving maybe to the conscripted ukrainian soldiers - if they can even identify that - professional ukrainian soldiers and volunteers could easily lose their lives in captivity . 
  ** retreat despite the will of kiev ** in the last days at debaltseve , istvan and his comrades did not leave their covered foxhole as they tried to avoid the russian and separatist attacks . 
  the hungarian man tells us they heated with a little iron stove , there was 15 degrees celsius in there , but that was not the problem . 
  the problem was that they had not been able to go to the toilet for days . 
  finally , on february 17 , the commanding officer of the 128th mukachevo brigade decided that he must save the five thousand soldiers trapped in the cauldron . 
  the high command in kiev did not issue such a command , but the command was approved later . 
  ** `` we climbed on the ural trucks , we were about forty for the twenty-eight places , that is how we get out . 
  but soon tanks fired upon us , fortunately , the first shot missed us , so everyone jumped out the truck , even the driver and we ran . 
  the second shot blow up the truck . 
  '' ** istvan and his comrades , as many others tried to get out the cauldron on foot in full gear : ** `` in a case like that , no one cares about how cold it is or how heavy is your stuff or about getting shot . 
  we just go , as long as we can . 
  we were lucky because of the dense fog . 
  '' ** they left in teams of 15-20 soilders . 
  istvan knows at least forty trucks , armoured vehicles and two tanks which was destroyed at the retreat from debaltseve . 
  only those three trucks made it which carried the wounded ahead of the convoy . 
  but he added , that unfortunately one wounded soldier bled to death on the way out . 
  ** mihaly and ilya plagued by nightmares ** those who was not in debaltseve did not escape the serious fighting . 
  the transcarpathian mihaly and ilya fought for the airport in lugansk , which was first regained from the separatists and then lost it again in september . 
  mihaly injured by a fragment in august , he has travelled the hospitals for months and even being treated in odessa by the time he was healed . 
  they are healed , if one can call healing that we speak with the two men at a psychiatry clinic 's yard in the town of berehove . 
  ** `` of course , we were not ready for war !, 
  we run around with rifles , which we did not shoot , and we painted fences . 
  '' ** told the years of fake training ilya , laughing . 
  he spent together with mihaly three months at the lugansk front instead of the specified 45 days . 
  both of them are plagued by insomnia and nightmares about battlefield for months . 
  ** `` but do not think that they sedate us here . 
  they help us with sleeping pills and therapy , i already feel better . 
  '' ** - says ilya , who had arrived here two weeks ago . 
  mihaly is her just for a day , so he do not know what to expect . 
  ** `` there are regular blowups about little things , i ca n't do anything with that . 
  i decided to come here when i yelled on my mother . 
  '' ** - confessed ilya to us , who is from a hungarian father , but who himself do not speak the hungarian language . 
  ** continue to serve ? 
  no , thanks !, 
  ** mihaly 's and ilya contract is prolonged because of the war and this year will expire , just like istvan 's contract . 
  the 21 and 22 years old men do n't want to prolong their contract . 
  they rather will seek a job abroad . 
  istvan also planning that , but he wants to return later to open a car repair shop . 
  in the next year he would like to hold his wedding , postponed beacuse of his war service . 
  but before that he have to return to the army by the middle of march . 
  ** `` the president met with us in artemivsk and promised us several months to rest , well , it has been three weeks . 
  '' ** - he said a little resentfully , but he does not go off prematurely from the army despite this . 
  only so because desertion means 15 years imprisonment . 
  he will serve tis few months somehow . 
  ** `` i am not afraid of death . 
  rather , i fear from being crippled for the rest of my life . 
  i wish i will be able to avoid that . 
  ** the national news channel failed at half past two ** - [ origo.hu ] ( http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20150315-bedolt-a-nemzeti-hircsatorna.html ) this afternoon , at half past two the newly launched national news channel 's ( formerly known as m1 , magyar 1 ) broadcast was already such a mess that they had to darken the screen . 
  helplessly abandoned program managers , technical ill-preparedness , and serious editorial and directorial errors . 
  eight and a half hours after its launch the new channel failed . 
  the newly started m1s creators was apparently caught unprepared by the continuous live broadcast . 
  the directors and editors completely lost the control . 
  the technical team is practically surrendered itself on today 's broadcast day . 
  in the morning there was a chain of serious sound problems . 
  mixed in or not mixed in sounds and microphones caused problems , bad videos , and failed live connections made the broadcast unwatchable . 
  among the screen captions chaos reigned . 
  through long minutes was absolutely no sign or suddenly just a broad white stripe appeared or substantively flawed texts have been aired . 
  at half past two the channel 's broadcast collapsed . 
  the [ video below ] ( http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20150315-bedolt-a-nemzeti-hircsatorna.html ) shows the total chaos leading to the total fade out . 
  they first called the slovakian correspondent , who is nowhere . 
  until the issue is resolved , the presenter in the studio asking the weatherman , who skillfully speak for a minute until they solve the problem . 
  the video become really interesting from 01 : 42 . 
  in bratislava the correspondent do n't know that he is on air , after that he speaks , but we can not hear him . 
  bal\u00e1zs somorjai , the reporter who became anchorman leafing his papers , the record-machine surely bounce back and forth before him until they told him on earphones that brief news is next . 
  after that the video jammed and the sound of the studio remained mixed in . 
  subsequently , nine scans follows in a second , unintelligible length . 
  the technical team apparently did not know which files would be broadcast next , then the image frozen . 
  at 03 : 34 the anchorman returns with a promise that news coming shortly , but his promise remained unfullfilled . 
  the director and everyone else gave up . 
  they helplessly downmix the screen to black , the new national feed blackouts . 
  after eight and half hours of the launch of the new channel , the entire crew failed . 
  ** the have been lost future ** by g\u00e1bor mikl\u00f3s , [ nol.hu ] ( http://nol.hu/velemeny/elveszejtett-jovo-1522651 ) i have two objects , i should bring them to the house of fates . 
  one of them is a photo . 
  my grandparents are on that , my aunt betsy and her husband , and their daughter , kathy haber . 
  she was about six years old at the time when the photo was taken . 
  she was ten years old when she was taken . 
  my grandfather , a baker by profession - fortunately -- did not live by then . 
  another object is my mother 's memorial book , with a note from my uncle . 
  george fried had recently learned to write , when he wrote his best wishes in her sister 's velvet bound book of memories in 1943 . 
  next to it he drawn a hungarian coat of arms . 
  with the crown . 
  george fried was an enthusiastic patriot . 
  that 's all i know about them . 
  my generation 's heritage is more about silence than complaint . 
  if we stop in front of the memorial plaque in the jewish cemetery in our small town , i myself guessing when i am telling my children , who else would be our relative , if they would have not been killed . 
  it is a good idea to commemorate lives that had barely begun . 
  what could explain better the whole horror of german nazism and hungarian racism than the killing of kathy haber , george fried and tens of thousands of other hungarian children and millions of their counterparts in other countries . 
  nazism - the murdering of children . 
  it is hardly possible to avoid the issue of hungarian complicity and indifference at such places . 
  what the neighbors felt when these children and their parents was driven through the streets of their town . 
  many felt sorry surely . 
  some were crying too . 
  there were heroes who rescued people .
