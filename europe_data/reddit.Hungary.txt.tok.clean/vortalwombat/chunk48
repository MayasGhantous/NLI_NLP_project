  but the beautiful numbers of the compassion and good deeds conceals the shocking indifference and greed . 
  will the visitor find data and illustrations about that in this house of fates ? 
  we do n't need to remember the innocent ( and of course , passive , and even helpless and story-less ) victims , but we need to remember the circumstances in which the holocaust happened . 
  for those who tolerated and those who were benefited from the big business . 
  i would name the gendarmes who searched the victims in the kom\u00e1rom fortress . 
  i would name those who asked for the remaining bed linens and pots of the victims at the town hall . 
  i would name the simple wolfish ones and hyenas . 
  i would name the hungarian government and the royal administrative apparatus , which was enthusiastically overachieving in the operation . 
  it should be difficult to remain scientific and objective in this field . 
  and it is virtually impossible to raise a memorial site alone for the children killed in the holocaust . 
  the public and political discussion are incomprehensible to me as a family member . 
  why is the secrecy about what are they arguing on ? 
  why we hear that the accidentally left alive survivors and their children has nothing to do with the content of a such museum ? 
  this must be a misunderstanding . 
  the house of fates - once established - will be the museum of the lost hungarian future . 
  the gassed and burned hungarian children could have been nobel prize-winning scientists , brilliant writers , actors , film directors or even historians . 
  could have been workers , teachers , merchants , and maybe even criminals . 
  but things are `` historically did not turn out . '',

  ** biological disaster on the hortob\u00e1gy ? 
  ** - [ index.hu ] ( http://index.hu/belfold/2015/03/17/biologiai_katasztrofa_a_hortobagyon/ ) 40,000 ewes ( 5 per cent of the national ewe population ) and about 4000-5000 cattle would die of starvation because of the corruption around the reapportion of [ hortob\u00e1gy national park ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hortob%c3%a1gy_national_park ) 's pasturelands ( by the goverment last year - translator ) wrote gabor rezes , a local farmer and a victim of the corruption scandal around the national land tenders . 
  according to rezes , the high number of livestock mortality may result in a biological disaster . 
  thanks for the outcome of the tender , local pasture-based livestock producer farmers with large herds did not won any grazing area for their livestock ( as the national land tenders won by not local farmers , but by businessmen close to pm orban 's governing fidesz - translator ) . 
  as a result , thousands of ewes and cattle were left without grazing area at the start of the cattle drive in april 2015 . 
  each farmer starts to run out from winter forage , so after april there is not any possibilities to feed that number of animals and that amount of livestock can not be sold for slaughter , as there is not enough capacity . 
  these circumstences will lead to a serious animal mortality wrote mr. rezes in his letter . 
  ** hungary have to demonstrate friendship with troops for the usa ** [ - 444 . hu by peter magyari ] ( http://444.hu/2015/03/23/katonakkal-kell-bizonyitania-magyarorszagnak-az-usa-elott/ ) andre goodfriend , the charg\u00e9 d'affaires of us unexpectedly left hungary in february , citing family reasons . 
  by that time the connection between the diplomat and the hungarian goverment was explicitly hostile , also personally , when pm viktor orban suggested that goodfriend is not manly enough . 
  ( `` stand up , be a man ! '' ), 
  goodfriend was a major player in the hungarian domestic politics for a few weeks , and more than once put the government in a very awkward position . 
  since his departure the relations between the two countries became much smoother , the newly appointed us ambassador have not criticized the government and except viktor orban 's 15 march speech ( `` nobody should lecture kossuth 's people from democracy '' ) , the government has not challenged the us . 
  obviously the main point is not the conflict between orban and goodfriend , as behind the comments and the departure of the later there is us policy . 
  the tension eased between the two governments , and each party had to make gestures . 
  america 's most spectacular gesture was the disapperance of goodfriend from hungarian politics . 
  ** however , washington asked a high price for this gesture : they asked hungarian soldiers to fight against the islamic state in iraq . 
  this request is extraordinary . 
  ** this is new , no other countries did it ever in our neighborhood . 
  it is extraordinary , because the military action against the islamic state is not a nato mission , but organized by a coalition lead by the us . 
  this is a big difference , the hungarian army has never took part in such coalition . 
  hungarian soldiers went to afghanistan as part of the nato 's mission and their supplying and training tasks in iraq were also organized by nato . 
  hungarian soldiers entered to foreign land since 1990 only in cooperation with international organizations , like the un , nato or the eu . 
  the request is also extraordinary , because no other country in the region received such request . 
  no other state in the region received open invitation to the coalition . 
  several major army of the western european nato members took part in the bombing of the islamic state 's bases , and also promised trainers to iraq , but the former socialist bloc countries just supplied arms to the kurds at best . 
  none of them has soldiers in the region , and there is no word about possible deployments . 
  according to plans , 100 hungarian soldiers will guarding training camps in northern iraq , and 50 reservists will be ready for deployment as reinforcements , for two years . 
  probably camps led by italian or german instructors would be defended by the hungarian soldiers . 
  the usa presumably did not ask other countries in the region to help this mission , because what these small countries can provide is more symbolic , but the risk of the deployment of troops is not negligible , as the brutality of the islamic state and its unpredictability , but potential attacks may target the intervening countries or their nationals . 
  ] ( http://www.hungarianhistory.com/lib/hunspir/hsp29.htm ) under the current circumstances , people experienced in diplomacy told us that the hungarian participation is related to the the big autumn conflicts with the us , and is about hungary wants to prove his loyalty to the usa . 
  and while we make this gesture , slowly the significance of the rest of our geopolitical debate seems to be weakening as well , the us obviously had problems with the pro-russian hungarian steps , but : - the south stream turned out not to be built , the russians gave up the idea , so the hungarian participation is no longer interesting . 
  - paks investment : a single concrete step have been taken as the european commission has drilled one contract . 
  yet not a penny called from the russian loan , and there was nothing happened to start the work . 
  - hungary 's behavior will be not decisive when the eu prolong ( or widens ) the sanctions against russia because many other member states oppose them , some of them far more than hungary ( such as greece , cyprus , and spain as a big one ) . 
  - mol did not sell the ina to the russians , and the future of the croatian energy company still not settled as the americans will continue to act as mediators in the negotiations . 
  these and military involvement of hungary against the islamic state have improved the standings of the hungarian goverment in washington , dc . 
  how much the mission in iraq helped to ease the relations is difficult to assess , but it is clear that the country is on uncharted waters . 
  the famous film , the wolf of wall street follows jordan belfort 's fraud and money laundering worth of usd 200 million . 
  ( ... ) in comparison , according to the information we already know both at buda-cash and at quaestor they managed to surpass stratton oakmont 's achievements . 
  in the case of ** buda-cash ** we know about ** usd 345 million ** stolen money , while ** quaestor ** issued a ** usd 517 million ** of notional bonds in addition to the regular issue of bonds , which it also wo n't be able to pay back . 
  if the use of funds from the regular bond issue also constitutes fraud , that means an additional ** usd 200 million ** . 
  - [ hvg.hu ] ( http://hvg.hu/gazdasag/20150319_a_wall_street_farkasa_elbujhat_a_budacas ) viktor orban 's fidesz ( in government since 2010 ) blames the socialists ( in goverment between 2002 and 2010 ) for the ** usd 1 billion scandal ** , and the mszp says we face the fidesz 's banking and brokerage scandal . 
  the far-right jobbik and the lmp blame everyone else , while the financial markets are making conspiracy theories and the victims run after their money . 
  it is likely that the buda-cash 's downfall was caused by the unexpected decision of the swiss national bank in january , which resulted a sudden franc strengthen against the euro and the forint . 
  the bigger customers of the brokerage firm suffered amazing losses then , and because of the dispute they turned to the supervisory body of the brokerage firm , which since 2013 , is the national bank of hungary ( nbh ) . 
  the central bank ordered an inspection at the company , and then it found the flagrant irregularities . 
  in the recent years the the leaders of the twenty years old brokerage firm made connections several times with the financial circles of the ruling fidesz party , not without conflicts . 
  one such conflict was caused by a regional radio which would have been suited to be a counterweight on the radio market against lajos simicska 's ( former friend and new enemy of viktor orban ) media corporation , but the negotiations between the goverment and the businessmen failed . 
  another conflict was caused by the compulsory integration of the hungarian credit unions in 2013 . 
  if the credit unions belonging to buda-cash 's sphere of interest would have to be included in this forced integration , the owners would have lost control over the financial institutions . 
  there was a way out , however , if a union initiated its transform to a bank prior to any legislative developments and closed the process by the end of 2013 , then it was `` saved '' . 
  this way was chosen by duna credit union of istvan garancsi ( owner of pm orban 's favourite videoton fc ) and the szechenyi bank of istvan torocskei ( which bankrupted since and also a friend of orban ) . 
  the buda-cash 's credit unions was `` saved '' this way , thanks to president janos ader 's veto , which gave them time to act . 
  the owner of questor , csaba tarsoly has excellent relations with pm orban 's fidesz , which indicated by the a key role of quaestor in the orb\u00e1n government 's opening to the east . 
  the quaestor contracted with the ministry of foreign affairs and foreign trade to operate the moscow and istanbul trading houses and the moscow visa center . 
  pm viktor orban ordered the ministry of foreign affairs to get out its money from quaestor ( usd 60 million ) a few days before the fall of the brokerage firm .

  - the politician was invited by a russian ngo to be an obsever at the ukrainian sepratist 's election , then rumor has it that he was banned from ukraine . 
  - the jobbik is more friendly with russia than any other party , but gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6si states the party is not pro-russian , but wanted to navigate between three great empires , like gabor bethlen . 
  - the last 25 years was about the colonization of hungary by the west . 
  - gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6si states that fidesz do n't even have good relations with eastern powers , they consider orban a turncoat . 
  ** you recently acted as an election observer in ukraine , in the separatist donetsk people 's republic . 
  then , according to some news you were banned from ukraine . 
  is that true ? 
  ** there were such news , but i have not received any official notification about that from the ukrainian goverment , neither from their embassy . 
  ** did you ask them ?
