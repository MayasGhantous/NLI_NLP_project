  ** i asked if there is any such decision , and i was told that i will be informed . 
  so far , i did not receive any formal notification . 
  i do not have sleepless nights because of that , i am not planning to travel to ukraine in the near future . 
  ** bit strange to say , that you are not planning such trip . 
  where were you last time ? 
  not in ukraine ? 
  ** i was in donetsk , in the donetsk people 's republic . 
  what donetsk exactly is now , it is difficult to determine , i think even ukraine ca n't define his connection with those areas . 
  there was a referendum last year and the inhabitants decided where they want to belong . 
  the donetsk people have decided they do not wish to belong to ukraine , which is attacking them with regular troops . 
  i think that 's understandable . 
  if we respect the democratic values , we can not use double standards . 
  it is strange and perverse , that we respect democracy and the people 's decision and their right to self-determination in some cases , while in other cases we does not . ** ( ... 
  ) ** ** from exactly whom did you receive the invitation to travel to donetsk ? 
  ** the invitation came from russia , moscow . 
  there was obviously a lot of attention for the donetsk and luhansk elections there , a number of organizations and parliamentary parties sent observers . 
  since i could n't travel to donetsk from ukraine , just from russia , we entered donbass from there . 
  i travelled through rostov . 
  ** but from which organisation did you receive the invitation ? 
  ** i can not remember their name , but it is a news agency specialised in the events and news of donbass . 
  novorossia press , if i remember correctly . 
  this organisation sent me the invitation and they organized my travel . 
  ** there were only representatives of pro-russian parties , or the mps of mszp and fidesz also received such invitations ? 
  ** i do n't know you should ask them . 
  i met the representatives of the bulgarian ataka , the belgian vlaams belang and the fp\u00d6 , but there was also the polish mateusz piskorski . 
  i was in donetsk , but there was also a contingent in luhansk . 
  this affair brought us together , the similar view of the ukrainian events and of course the desire to be independent of the one-sided western propaganda and see with our own eyes the situation in the civil war zone . ** ( ... 
  ) ** ** well , let me put that this way : a western-style democracy is not better than what we experience in the east like in turkey or in russia ? 
  ** there are people for whom it is better and there are people for whom it is not . 
  during boris yeltsin 's ten years , the oligarchs and the west almost ruined russia and the russian people suffered terribly . 
  russia experienced one of the most serious crises in its modern history under the ten years of yeltsin . 
  interestingly , in the west , russia received only positive reviews during that period . 
  what we have now it can not be compared to the period marked by boris yeltsin 's name , what the whole west ballyhooed as a transition to democracy . 
  obviously , a weak leader served the western interests much better than putin . 
  and it 's not my job to determine whether putin is a good or bad leader of his people , it is the job of the russian people . 
  let the russians decide if they prefer the system of putin over anything else . 
  as long as 70 to 80 percent support president putin on the elections - we surely could talk about that elections ... it is hard to tell what could be better for the russian people . 
  if they believe that they want to live not in a democratic system , which washington sees ideal , but in a system marked by the name of putin , erdogan or li kuan ju , or in a china , as we know it , they have every right for that . 
  if that system is able to raise living standards , can show economic performance and prosperity , and the people happy with that system , then they will support that system . 
  believe me , the people of singapore is not thinking about the criterias of the american liberal democracy . ** ( ... 
  [ what is this scandal ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30d6nb/hungary_pm_orban_and_the_brokerage_scandal_of_the/ ) ** the man to solve the usd 1 billion financial scandal in hungary ** - [ 444 . hu ] ( http://444.hu/2015/03/31/ennek-az-embernek-kellene-megoldania-a-legnagyobb-magyar-penzugyi-botranyt/ ) tibor ibolya chief prosecutor of budapest district , said such things about the quaestor affair this tuesday night on atv 's straight talk , that viewers could be astonished and scared the same time . 
  the full video can be viewed online ( [ in hungarian ] ( http://www.atv.hu/belfold/20150331-ibolya-tibor-eb ) ) , but it is worth to take the most serious allegations . 
  ibolya opened with the statement , that he do n't think that there was a change in the ownership of quaestor ( but there was , when the core company , the questor financial consulting ltd. on march 16th was acquired by its subsidiary financial hrurira ltd. which issued the fake bonds originally , and with the acquisition they converted the debt to properity with a fake capital increase , which step was quite rearranged the order of compensation ) . 
  according to the chief prosecutor , responsible for the case , when bela orgovan the ex-convict public worker took over the company last week , that does n't matter ( `` it 's like a grocery store changes its ' seller '' ) , moreover it supports the investigation , as it proves that the suspicion is well-founded . 
  orgovan 's career as a executive director was not even happened according to ibolya , since his appointment was invalid because in order to become manager , one should need five years of clear criminal record , which orgovan does n't have . 
  according to ibolya csaba tarsoly has a good defender and he was certainly not advised these steps on the march 16 meeting of quaestor . 
  ibolya also suggested in the interview that the prosecutor 's office did not know of the quaestor 's general meeting of 16 march , so they did not know about the change of the management and the owner . 
  ( although ibolya denied the latter fact in the full length of the interview , inexplicably . ), 
  but it does not matter , because according to the prosecutor it is unthinkable that csaba tarsoly would try to hide evidence , like transfer of documents , because of `` objective reasons '' . 
  that what are these objective reasons , he was not willing to talk about , but dropped a reference about the interception of phone calls . 
  however , he assured that tarsoly was not able to get rid of any evidence with that step , because he could do that before march 11 , before the documents of quaestor was seized by the investigators . 
  why did nothing happen for so long ? 
  because it can `` ruin a criminal investigation '' if the suspect was taken into custody too early . 
  information may be leaked from the investigation before it become proof , said ibolya . 
  `` uncle gyuri magyar '' ( gy\u00f6rgy magyar , the lawyer of the aggrieved investors ) spoke an `` orbital silly talk , '' when urged that csaba tarsoly should be arrested asap said the capital 's chief prosecutor . 
  and by the way , they had to ask account informations from two unnamed large bank , which took a lot of time . 
  the complaint of the hungarian national bank , in which they spoke about a huf 150 billion in notional bonds at quaestor is not enough to raise suspicions , according to the prosecutor general . 
  according to ibolya it is also not interesting , that the policemen worked on the case was replaced in mid-march with an other detective team from a rural area . 
  the point is , that whoever is working on it will do a professionally work and this is what happenned in this case . 
  how many prosecutors are on the case ? 
  must be many as there are several thousand pages of documents and 800 gigabytes of data and the plot is complicated and witnesses are many . 
  well the answer is no , there are 3 , i repeat three prosecutors working on the case . 
  it is not a problem that three prosecutors trying to put together an indictment about a decade of sophisticated financial practices ? 
  according to ibolya , it 's all right , though it was important to note for him that he is very dissatisfied that more than 25 percent of the prosecutors are on permanent leave . 
  did you hear that prosecutor ladies ? 
  stop making too much babies . 
  [ testimony of former director of the hungarian tax authority on the court : senior management covered up a fraud of $ 135 million .

  the head of the tax audit department , ms. marianna davida started a personal privacy lawsuit against the publishers of [ nepszava ] ( http://nepszava.hu ) and [ nepszabadsag ] ( http://nol.hu ) because these two newspapers claimed that she is on the entry ban list of the us goverment . 
  atlatszo.hu was there on the first day of the trial . 
  mr. zsolt hegedus deme , former director of the main cases directorate for a year between 2010 and 2011 was the defendants ' witness and he presented a 90 minutes testimony . 
  ( hungarian video on the link ) he spoke about an audit in his testimony , where after two years of investigations they found an euro 135 millions tax deficiency at an unnamed big company . 
  according to the testimony of mr. hegedus the investigation was in its second year when ms. marianna davida and ms. katalin somos ( another leader of nav ) sent clear signals to him that they are dissatisfied with the findings of the audit . 
  hegedus said that in january 2011 , the deputy of ms. katalin somos , melinda r\u00e1kosa called the involved directors for a meeting to the central office of nav . 
  according to hegedus on that meeting it was made clear that they have to let it go and finish the audit .
