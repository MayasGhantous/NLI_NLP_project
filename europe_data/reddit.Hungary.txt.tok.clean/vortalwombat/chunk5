  have you not heard the news ? 
  it was my understanding that everyone heard about certain geographical traits of cluj : http://youtu.be/qrhjwbrv2rc , 
  they will just cut in the lottery girl 's face . 
  after all these years in government orban and the fidesz are still able to surprise me with these new lows . 
  votes before everything . 
  no , it is n't . 
  denmark is known as a country with great agriculture , and one of its best known product is butter ( and beer , and lego ) , so that is the reason behind the cows , i suppose . 
  many of the old hungarians still remember the danish butter which was part of the food packages , which they got as humanitarian aid in 1956 . 
  puskas and the mighty magyars ... those days are gone . 
  even the 80s looks like a golden age now . 
  our last good moment was in 2009 in egypt , and that was a u19 tournament . 
  i did n't know that . 
  they always broadcast it as a live show . 
  but i usually do n't watch it , so it 's possible . 
  re-editing seems a bit too much for me in case of a lottery show . 
  there was a similar thing in hungary a few months before , when a woman stand up before her name was drawn to be the one who drawn the numbers . 
  ( usually it depends on the outcome of a previous game in the show , that the numbers would be drawn by a person or by a machine ) . 
  nothing happened , so the serbians are cool . 
  video about her when she stands up too soon : http://youtu.be/pcc-kkxbu2q, 
  hungarians like figo for some reason . 
  this [ ad ] ( https://youtu.be/l1ammj-rxzu ) was made after his retirement . 
  i 'd just like to add this : http://sport.hir24.hu/kezilabda/2015/05/20/nagy-laci-konnyet-csalt-a-szurkolok-szemeba/ so nagy laci is not a traitor , but a hero again . 
  and we also like pole dance . 
  i do n't understand it either . 
  old hungarian trait . 
  there is a [ classic hungarian comedy ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059812/ ) about ww2 deserters who are hiding in a country mansion and when they 're almost caught by the ss , because they left the remnants of their recent feast on a table , one of them says that : `` it 's because we are always gobbling . 
  hungarian curse . '', 
  ** viktor orb\u00e1n can not stop the cigarette smuggling ** a social explosion will develop in the winter months in ukraine , if we ca n't stabilize the economic situation by then - said l\u00e1szl\u00f3 brenzovics to the origo . 
  according to the president of the cultural association of the hungarians in transcarpathia it is not possible to set limits to the cigarette smuggling , as long as there is a huge difference between production costs and selling prices . 
  * kiev ca n't liberate now donetsk and luhansk . 
  * the migration of hungarians from transcarpathia could continue . 
  * it 's not possible to restrict cigarette smuggling . 
  * l\u00e1szl\u00f3 brenzovics do not trust in decentralization . 
  ** is there any data about how many transcarpathian hungarians fighting in eastern ukraine and how many of them kia ? 
  ** no such data is available as they are not asking the ethnic affiliation . 
  ( ... ) according to my information there are five ethnic hungarians killed in fighting in eastern ukraine , they were all professional soldiers . ( ... ), 
  around a hundred hungarians took part in the fighting there . 
  ** does everyone already accept that they are not able to achieve a significant breakthrough in the frozen conflict in eastern ukraine ? 
  ** they are not accepted that , but reality overrides desires . 
  it was an interesting phenomenon , that during the debate on the constitutional amendment the ukrainian government parties were divided . 
  the porosenko - and the yulia tymoshenko block both argued for the change , while the radicals sharply opposed . 
  especially they criticized the passage which referred to a some kind of a special status of the not controlled part of the donetsk and luhansk region . 
  this debate very quickly were about the disagreement concerning war and peace . 
  the radical part of the ruling party gave anti-europe and anti-nato statements , and they stated that the minsk agreement forces the recognition of the special status . 
  the answer was that those who think that it is forced , were allowed to take a gun and fight for the liberation of those parts . 
  this extremely sharp statement also suggests that saner part of the leading group knows that it is an asymmetric conflict in which ukraine alone ca n't win . 
  the porosenko - party wants to build a fortified line along the current frontline , which also indicates that the government ca n't make a difference on the battlefield . 
  unfortunately , because of very many reasons the minsk agreement can not be enforced , like there wo ' t be municipal elections in october in the affected areas . 
  ** how long ukraine can hold out ? 
  ** it was surprising for russia that ukraine did not collapse under the weight of the first strike . 
  kiev is able to maintain the current front line , but the country is close to bankruptcy , and we are not yet collapsed just because of the western loans . 
  it 's negative that the international monetary fund in return for the loans demands such steps , which worsening the ukrainian citizens ' life conditions dramatically . 
  more and more austerity steps can also lead to a social explosion . 
  especially in the winter , when a significant part of the population will be , objectively , unable to pay its bills . 
  ** it is possible to stop the transcarpathian exodus in such a situation ? 
  ** the exodus of hungarians from transcarpathia is a process that started a very long time ago . 
  in the 20th century , a significant number of hungarians left transcarpathia at every border changes . 
  lately it has been intensified since the hungarians in transcarpathia are under double pressure . 
  on one hand there is the total uncertainty because of the war , on the other is the extreme economic downturn . 
  this leads to the migration of the the working male population , because otherwise they can not support their families . 
  despite all of this , you ca n't talk about escaping . 
  the main solution would be the peace , which is also the interest of ukraine , that would lead to the stabilization of the situation , so some of the displaced will certainly return . 
  ** do you have any experiences that the hungarian border guards directly involved in cigarette smuggling ? 
  ** transcarpathia lies on the border of five european countries and the smuggling is a huge tradition in this region . 
  even the soviets were able to stop it only with barbed wire , and after 1990 it started to flourish . 
  recently , it reached an industrial dimension . 
  the main reason of this that anti-tobacco fight in western europe increased the price of cigarettes to cosmic heights . 
  in london a pack of cigarettes is 5-7 pounds , while the production cost is only 30 cents . 
  you ca n't eliminate smuggling as long as there is such a big difference . 
  the united states could n't stop alcohol smuggling by administrative measures and the us of the 1930s was much more organized state than today 's ukraine . 
  ** so the replacement of the customs commanders is useless ? 
  ** it can bring interim results , but not a success.in addition , this change will only increase tension among the population of transcarpathia , as the money from the smuggling is spread among the people . 
  obviously , it is needed to restore order , but europe should review its policy on smoking , but i do not think that anyone can stop smuggling . 
  ** the aforementioned constitutional amendment can create a more autonomous transcarpathia ? 
  ** if the law is implemented properly , it can actually create a more independent transcarpathia . 
  however , there are plenty of doubts , because this reform starts in a situation , when ukraine faces serious problems . 
  in addition to that , the amendment of the constitution contains elements which makes the decentralization relative . 
  the reason is that the president will be able veto any action of the local authorities . 
  residents of both villages started to protest against the decision of the government . 
  in my opinion sending thousands of refugees in such small villages just proves again that the government using the refugees to increase its popular support and they following the alleged [ habony-rogan-finkelstein plan ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3fa09j/hungary_arpad_habonys_popularity_soars_in_fidesz/ ) to increase their support by trouble-making .

  that 's true , it 's indeed teh , not the .

  it 's normal , logical and ancient . 
  it started like `` jozsef fia janos '' what means `` joseph 's son john '' became jozseffi janos '' `` josephson john '' or a short fellow named janos became kis janos ; small john . 
  it 's happened because of the inner logics of our language and survived thanks to the independent nature of our nation and nobility and our more than thousand years old national heritage , so after all it feels good . 
  `` te '' means ... wait for it ... `` you '' in hungarian . 
  te ( sounds like teh ) - singular , ti ( sounds like tea in english ) - plural . 
  tl ; dr : finns are just hungarians on foot with less melanin . 
  it 's because basques and hungarians are rather tricky .

  this article was written three weeks ago and it is explaining the recent steps of the hungarian government concerning the immigration , the clashes with the eu , and the trolling of the romanian public in baile tusnad as a part of a greater pr plan to increase the popularity of the governing parties in hungary . 
  * dear mods !, 
  as this post is not about immigration , please do n't move it to the megathread .
