  i found an [ article ] ( http://www.szeretlekmagyarorszag.hu/20-magyar-falu-ami-el-fog-tunni/ ) about shrinking hungarian villages , like iborfia ( population in 2014 : 8 people ) . 
  these villages have cheap houses , police patrols , school bus sevice , mobile post office , medical care , some kind of a bus service to nearby cities but these services do n't stop the decline , people abandoning their villages and moving to cities for better jobs , leaving just empty villages behind . 
  some community try to create jobs ( mainly agricultural jobs ) but it does n't solve the problem . 
  do you have the same problem in your country or it 's just a local problem in hungary ? 
  do you have any idea to stop the decline ? 
  like an euro kibbutz movement ? 
  create holiday villages out of them ? 
  ** fugitive country ** by gabor miklos , [ nol.hu ] ( http://nol.hu/velemeny/menekulo-orszag-1530495 ) eritreans appear in hungary . 
  they are fugitives , called economic migrants or migrants for a living by the current terminology . 
  the latter term refers to the fact , that their respective home lack adequate economic means to live there , and therefore they leave to start a new life elsewhere - possibly in europe , and possibly in the richer and more attractive part of europe . 
  the creative who made up the word implies , that these immigrants are not intended to looking for a job , but they after the benefits of the welfare system in our gracious christian culture . 
  but why are the eritreans everywhere ? 
  i have seen them in vienna , italy and israel . 
  they are the close relatives of the ethiopeans , speak a similar language , they are coptic christians with a muslim minority . 
  distinguishable from other africans . 
  lot of people are fleeing from eritrea because that state on the coast of the red sea carries almost all the misfortunes what africa could offer , carries all the sins of the local powers , of the traditional and the new colonialists . 
  ( eritrea was colonized by italy in the 19th century . 
  after the first world war , it was managed by the british , after that the ethiopians got their hands on it . ), 
  in these days eritrea has a big bad luck with its own elite , or more precisely the dictatorship , which seized the country . 
  in the country there was a guerilla war against the invading ethiopia for decades . 
  when the nationalist-communist regime , maintained by the soviets collapsed in ethiopia , the country became independent . 
  the ethiopian invaders replaced by the former guerillas , and their leader became the dictator . 
  there is a one-party system in eritreia since 1993 . 
  there are no elections , almost the entire population serve in the army . 
  to leave the country is forbidden . 
  the freedom of the press is on a north korean level . 
  no bread , no freedom . 
  the oppression maintained by party state is orwellian . 
  in addition to the wars drought and earthquake hit the country . 
  how such a situation could be changed ? 
  what could make the eritrean young people to stay at home , to not start a journey , even risking their lives on the route ? 
  all misfortunes , which in other african migrant/refugee sending states separately create cumbersome situations are combined together in that country . 
  colonialism left distorted economy and infrastructure behind . 
  the tribal , clan relations and religious differences inside the artificial borders are fueling the conflict . 
  feuds with neighboring states , from where the wars sometimes come over . 
  moreover , this part of the world is not interesting for the world economy . 
  even the pirates are somalian and not eritrean . 
  and on top of it all there is a regular party dictatorship . 
  is it a wonder that those who can , flee anywhere , at any price ? 
  the real question is , what can the world do for them . 
  all european leaders keep preaching that we should stop this escape at the starting point , by eliminating the causes of migration . 
  how ? 
  with what ? 
  `` public relations is at best promotion or manipulation , at worst evasion and outright deception . '', 
  - heather brooke ( the journalist , not the porn actress ) if you have a favourite cheesy country promotional video , do n't hesitate to share your experience . 
  there were many statements in various posts here in the past weeks / months along the lines , that : the russians are not europeans , one just needs to look at ukraine and what they did in the ww2 , in the baltic states , poland , ukraine , prussia . 
  they are just racist , anti-liberal , watch-loving , homophobic etc. 
  foot soldiers of a maniac ( this time putin ) etc. 
  the soviets were not russians , but communists . 
  i do n't know for sure what putin is , but i think he is mainly putinist and not russian . 
  in hungary we have an idiom , i suppose it is in use in other countries as well : `` we should n't throw out the baby with the bathwater . '', 
  so , we should n't throw out the russians from europe with the communists and putin . 
  i think we should remember , that russia is more than putin , stalin , lenin or even the various czars . 
  as an example for this , we should remember that the first victims of the soviet leaders were the russian people : [ russian famine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_famine_of_1921 ) - between 1921-1922 and killed 6,000,000 people in regions around the volga and ural .
