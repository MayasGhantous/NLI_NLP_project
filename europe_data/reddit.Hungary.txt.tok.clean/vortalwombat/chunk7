  so when the government prattles all day long about the immigration as the biggest problem of the western civilization , and about how hungary is ready to act , it is enough to look at the budget to find out , are there any serious , thoughtful plans on the side of the government or they simply take advantage of a pr opportunity . 
  the disturbing nature of this whole romanian-hungarian relationship here starts to remind me [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/_2kznf334ky?t=26s ) scene . 
  i am upset ? 
  that is the normal way for you to speak like baszodni / fasz ? 
  what should i say ? 
  `` crying about '' `` basz\u00f3dni - fucking '' `` faszok mint te - dicks like you '' . 
  good arguments . 
  i do n't like to change language in the middle of the thread , so : eat a dick you sob , if you ca n't handle other opinions then why are you here ? 
  the monarchy wo n't come back , not because of me , but because everyone is fed up with the habsburgs and their butthurt minions like you . 
   and why would i ever blame hungarians for decisions made by ruling elite ? 
  that is a very mature position . 
  the gendarmes of the hungarian kingdom in the late 19th century shot volley fires on protesting hungarians as well several times , only they called them socialist , anarchist ( or `` stincky peasants '' ) and not `` rioting nationalities '' . 
  ( the last such incident was in 1935 , in gyomaendr\u0151d ; 6 dead , 17 wounded * ), 
  in the case of hungary it is equal ethnicity , with one exception , the romas . 
  but i would n't declare that the romas are not hungarians , that would lead us to dangerous waters . 
  many of the hungarians does n't declare its ethnicity as a protest against the question in the plebiscite survey form ( because of what happened under and after the war ) . 
  then we are on the same page on that , i do n't like the monarchy either . 
  you know first you used a classic slovakian argument , according to which slota is just an alcoholic , but all hungarian right wing politician are dangerous . 
  hungarians in the 19th century were morons , but the constant decrease of the hungarians ' percentage in slovakia ( and romania ) since 1920 is just a natural phenomenon and just fine etc. 
  i think it 's just classic double standard . 
  beware , the itari force is strong with that one . 
  if i understand well , based on these two comments of yours hungarians always evil , slovaks are always good and honest people , and you are not a nationalist at all . 
  well , the original statement was about `` any guy '' , not about officials . 
  nah , it 's just a prophecy about the ukrainian national football team winning the world cup in serbia . 
  14.5 million people spoke hungarian as his/her * first language in 2011 , in the carpathian basin , not 10.4 million . 
  edit : fun fact : downvotes wo n't change statistics . 
  ha-ha . 
  and we will also have a great civil war in a few years . 
  iirc that guy wanted to send the hungarians into the danube and also wanted to send tanks to budapest . 
  how funny . 
  i know that guy , he is a hungarian agent . 
  come on . 
  just an example , last time i stated here that kossuth is a national hero for hungary ( and i did n't mention any of our neighbours , it was a comment about the hungarian feelings towards the habsburgs ) , this happened : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dy8y5/do_you_remember_the_austrohungarian_empire_well/cta1qwa it turned out that kossuth was a moron , because he did n't supported the full autonomy of the slovaks , romanians and serbs . 
  on the other hand those hungarians who today wants cultural autonomy in south-slovakia or in transylvania ( what is less then what the slovaks wanted in the 19th century ) are also morons and fascists . 
  it 's a bit confusing . 
  `` da chi mi fido mi guardi dio , da chi non mi fido , mi guarder\u00f2 io . '', 
  ** translation ** : ** finally , transcarpathian hungarians will be able to learn the ukrainian language ** the chairman of the responsible committee of the rada urging the reform of the ukrainian language education of the national minorities in ukraine , after he saw the results of the high school final exams . 
  the politician of the popular front party led by arsenij jaceniuk suggested a compromise solution , which would offer an opportunity to the hungarian students in transcarpathia to learn the ukrainian language using a method , which can deliver results . 
  lilia hrinevics realized that the transcarpathian hungarians and romanians belongs to a completly different group of ethnicity than the slavs and therefore the ukrainian language should n't be taught to them as a second native language , when he saw the awful final exam results of the minority students . 
  ** it has been asked for a long time . 
  ** president of the science and education committee of the supreme council recommends that the ukrainian language should be taught for the minorities as a * state language * . 
  the fundamental difference is that the transcarpathian hungarian students in the future will be able to learn the ukrainian as a foreign language , with a different teaching method . 
  the hungarian groups in ukraine has been calling for this since the independence of ukraine , but the ukrainian nationalist forces so far did not want to hear about the idea , that the ukrainian language could be treated as a foreign language at any level . 
  since the introduction of the new final exam system , the ukrainian public education system calls for the same language requirements for the minority students as for the native ukrainian-speaking students . 
  the majority of the hungarian graduates thus almost inevitably falls short of that criteria , and thus they artifically deprived of the chance of further education in ukraine . 
  the proposition of lilia hrinevics could hopefully remedy this two decades old problem . 
  that process takes time . 
  maybe it would be better to send 50 - 50 immigrants to 10 cities or bigger villages . 
  that would n't be any better . 
  i do n't know maybe they should send 50 immigrants in 10 cities or bigger villages , if austria have to export its immigrants to other countries . 
  i travelled there with the school and by bus , so i am a bit confused , i remember szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti , but i am not sure if i was in \u00c9rmindszent or in csucsa . 
  i think it was csucsa , as we visited the market at feketet\u00f3 ( that was very folk ) . 
  first time when i was there i was 5 years old , and it was the old ceausescu regime . 
  i remember that the poverty ( after hungary ) was shocking even for me , as a kid . 
  empty shops , sad people in bad clothes ( we were in arad or kolozsv\u00e1r , i do n't know , we were at a holiday at gyula and travelled from there to romania for a day ) . 
  the second time , around 1995 or 96 was different ; it was still not as good as hungary , but it was a developing area , much more brighter . 
  and for the food : ** zakuszka ** !, 
  man , that is something !, 
  just twice , both occasions were almost twenty years ago , travelled around in the partium ( v\u00e1rad , arad and parts of szatm\u00e1r ) and to kolozsv\u00e1r . 
  nah , nothing hate , we had a good conversation . 
  szatm\u00e1r is a beautiful place . 
   i do n't quite understand your first statement :( you asked me that the romanian driver-link : `` was published only because i 'm from romania and somehow challenged your views about policemen in hungary ? 
  we already feel like crap in `` your '' country most of times , do n't make us hate your guts ! '', 
  i answered that no , and told a story or anecdote about a paranoid romanian , and i also stated that an average hungarian ( ofc not the ones with greater hungary bumper stickers ) does n't care about romania . 
  like , honestly i did n't realized that posting that link would be considered offensive by anyone for any reason . 
  also i knew that you are a hungarian or has a hungarian parent because you said : `` it may be because we have romanian plates but talking hungarian with them does n't mean anything anyway . 
  '' , when you talked about the bribings . 
  i used the first because i did n't want to get this post deleted for editorializing of the title . 
  the meaning is just the same , i suppose . 
   orban is an incompetent politician nope , he is a brilliant politician . 
  he is manipulating his voters like no one else . 
  ofc he is a [ semen ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2015/02/07/internal-war-in-hungary-ex-ally-oligarch-against-pm-orban/ ) , but that is another question . 
  i got that from an earlier post , but you asked that if i posted that because you 're from romania and somehow challenged my views about policemen in hungary . 
  but okay , it depends only on the romanians . 
   you work for police ? 
  no , thanks god i was just unlucky as i was in the first car behind the truck and he closed the lane , so i ( and 5 other cars ) could n't move until he parked there . 
  i learned that i can be fined for anything . 
  no , it was on the first page of the google hits for searching `` megkenni a rend\u0151rt '' ( bribe a policeman ) , nothing like that . 
   we already feel like crap in `` your '' country most of the time it depends only on ~ ~ you ~ ~ romanians . 
  a romanian truck driver once asked me ( in basic english ) where he could find an adress . 
  he asked that while he stopped in the middle of the exit lane on the m7 at t\u00f6r\u00f6kb\u00e1lint , so he closed the whole highway exit . 
  i told him to move away from the exit lane , turn left and park beside the road so i would show where to find that company . 
  he looked at me like i was a robber and turn into the other direction at the end of the lane and drove away . 
  so i think the bigger part of that feeling is just paranoia , as most of the hungarians and please do n't take it as an offense , really do n't care the romanians and have neutral feelings . 
  sorry , i deleted the comment in the meantime , i thought you asking the policemen ( like the site of the ticket ) and answered for that . 
  but , no , i only know the facebook page of the group . 
  that would n't work in real life , as the guests would start rioting after the second move . 
  no offense taken , i really told that just as an advice , not out of any idealism . 
  it depends on the situation , opportunity makes the thief . 
  since i got two tickets for the same wrong bulb on the same night ( that is theoretically against the law , but the second pair of policemen told me , that if i want they could find two other ticketable offense and report me for those , i paid the fee , which meant i paid 40 euros for a 15 km trip ) i really do n't have any warm feelings towards our police . 
  maybe you should left them a message ( either the romanian or the hungarian group ) on the facebook , so they could get in touch if needed ( like in the case when family members separated etc. ), 
  i would n't try that , but u/verylateish had another experiences . 
  since the 90 's a very good connection needed between the policemen on the spot to accept a bribe , as they are afraid that another policeman from the unit rat them out .
