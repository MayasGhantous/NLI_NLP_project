  honestly , i have never tried to bribe them . 
  it 's better to pay max . 
  100 euro for speeding then to summoned to court and such . 
  just some google hits , all in hungarian : [ drunken driver prosecuted after tried to bribe ] ( http://mno.hu/kek_hirek/reszeg-sofor-akarta-megkenni-a-rendoroket-a-balatonnal-1172364 ) [ guy sentenced 14 months in jail because he wanted to bribe the policeman with cheese ] ( http://k-monitor.hu/hirek/magyar-hirek/sajttal-akarta-megkenni-a-rendoroket-14-honapot-kapott ) ( edit : he was drunk ) [ policeman declined 1000 euro bribe and others were decorated ] ( http://m.delmagyar.hu/szeged_hirek/jutalmat_kaptak_a_rendorok/2192821/ ) [ romanian driver reported after tried to bribe policemen ] ( http://alfahir.hu:8081/node/122426 ), 
  in the late 90s they introduced a system where they only give you a yellow postal checks to pay the ticket , they did not accept cash on site . 
  if you are not a hungarian citizen , then maybe they accept cash , to secure the payment of the fee , but not as a bribe . 
  it 's because when they introduced the postal checks , they also introduced that they never send old colleagues and friends in pairs to the field , so they would n't accept the bribe , because they are afraid that an other policeman would rat them out . 
  when they introduced this , there were some cases , when policemen set-up people ( they implied that they want a bribe and then prosecuted the driver for bribing ) . 
  i would n't try to bribe them , but ofc every bribe depends on the situation . 
  i do n't know , but i think they are not ( i mean ; in touch * ) . 
  it looks like they just started to help people , when they saw their circumstances on the train stations and such places . 
   did they ask for bribes ? 
  i am not joking ; offering bribe to a hungarian police officer usually is a very bad idea . 
  since the late 90s its impossible to bribe them in everyday situations . 
  sorry about that . 
  this is the charm of the live feed . 
  not strictly on topic , but i 'd like to link the [ facebook page ] ( https://www.facebook.com/migrationaidhungary ) of the ** migration aid ** , a group of everyday citizens , which coordinates the effort to help the immigrants arrived to our country . 
  without any governmental or eu help these people organized a network of volunteer citizens , which network provide help , like translation , water , food , blankets , clothes , shoes etc. 
  for those who arrives in hungary these days , as refugees and immigrants , and who , after the crossing of the balkan are mostly in a very bad shape . 
  before anyone should start the `` hungary was always ... '' speeches , please consider that this is also hungary , these people are also hungarians . 
  here is some articles about this effort in hungarian : cegl\u00e9d : http://hvg.hu/itthon/20150707_kezzel_labbal_szivvel_szajjal__cegledi szeged : http://hvg.hu/itthon/20150628_csodalatos_osszefogas_kibontakozoban_szeg budapest : http://hvg.hu/itthon/20150630_azonnali_cselekvesre_van_szukseg__a_fo edit : sadly this part of the story is not as interesting for the international media , like the government press releases . 
  also it is easier to attend a press conference with cold drinks , sandwiches and pogacsas then to travel the country and meet with the people . 
  5k means almost the whole village . 
  not hungary . 
  its government and certain voters . 
  there are many good examples , where many people help immigrants , not because they need or have to , but because the want to . 
  ofc there are right wing extremists , but that is not a unique hungarian thing . 
  where ? 
  in romania . 
   ( just joking , usually in croatia . ), 
  ** translation : ** * updates in bold and sorry for the possible mistakes in translation . 
  * ** 10:07 : ** the existence of europe is at stake ; it 's a modern migration period , we have to keep europe for the europeans and hungary for the hungarians . 
  ** 10:10 : ** the left think that immigration is an opportunity ; the european left think that immigration is not a danger , but an opportunity to finally destroy the national boundaries . 
  what would have happen to hungary if the left won in 2010 ? 
  according to orban we would n't recognize our country by now . 
  ** 10:13 : ** the european union has only principles ; brussels can not defend the union against the masses of immigrants , because for that it would need to act as a sovereign , but that would mean the narrowing of national sovereignty . 
  the idea of eu which offered a real solution has became an ideological obsession . 
  what hungary does is successful , but does n't fit in the european frames , because it strenghten the national sovereignty . 
  but hungary wants a strong eu . 
  ** 10:15 : ** europe has no answers ; the us is not great because of the lack of nations , but because they always find good solutions for problems . 
  europe needs to do that either , but it failed to offer a solution since 2008 , the start of the depression . 
  ** 10:18 : ** the economy is fine ; hungary has never asked for easing any of its debt , the economy is expanding , all of the economic indicators are improving . 
  we get rid of foreign currency loans , strategic sectors got nationalized , what is a key factor for the sovereignty . 
  ** 10:22 : ** there is a connection between the illegal immigrants and terrorism in europe . 
  the anglo-saxon nations know that , others deny that . 
  we can not find the terrorists in that enormous mass . 
  he quoted british pm cameron , who said that `` we ca n't stop the crisis , if we ca n't stop those people on the borders . '', 
  it 's simple ; more incoming migrants will increase unemployment in regions where it is already high . 
  illegal immigration is threatening europe and hungary , it is threatening our national security , hampering our economical development . 
  ** 10:26 : ** the hungarian position is based on a national consultation ; 8,000,000 letters was sent out and 1,000,000 filled out form came back . 
  according to those , the two-thirds of the hungarians consider the terrorism an important thing , and three-fourths of them think that the immigrants threatening their safety and living conditions . 
  the four-fifths of them urging the government to sever the rules against the will of brussels in order to arrest the immigrants and send them back to where they came from . 
  95 % of them think that it is more important to support the hungarian families and improving the desire to have children in the population . 
  ** 10:37 : ** europe is at stake ; europe , the way of life of the european citizens , the survival of the european nations , their disappearance or survival is at stake , or their change beyond recognition . 
  ** 10:39 : ** the future is not a race about searching the distance , it 's more like a race to acquiring knowledge about the past . 
  the winner will be that one , who knows his past better , and can put two and two together faster and act boldly . 
  * it looks like that 's all , nothing illiberal this year . 
  now , after this brief lecture in transylvania , our pm will come home . 
  sorry , romania , we need him at home , he ca n't stay any longer . 
  b\u0151s has 5361 inhabitants , of which 4711 are hungarians , and 580 are slovaks . 
  now the slovak and austrian government send 500 asylum seekers to that village . 
  strange decision . 
  [ michael schumacher in barcelona , 1996 .

  ** translation ** : ** hungary : goverment can not built border fence without archaeological supervising ** the government decided to quickly build a fence on the serbian-hungarian border , but this decision can block the archaeological exploration of the area . 
  sandor pinter ( * minister of interior * ) in gumboots and the unshaven janos lazar ( pm 's office 's minister ) talked differenet planned depth for the fence posts to the press . 
  the serbian-hungarian border fence will be built out of two types of galvanized posts and panels , said j\u00e1nos l\u00e1z\u00e1r at his weekly press conference . 
  one type of fence will be 3 meters high and will be one and a half meters deep in the ground . 
  for the rougher parts , where it is harder to tresspass , they plan a smaller fence , which is easier to build , but they declined to communicate futher details about its height and depth . 
  the planned one and a half meter depth contradicts to what s\u00e1ndor pinter told at m\u00f3rahalom ( * hungarian village near the serbian border * ) . 
  the origo asked the interior minister back then about the archaelogical supervision at the construction site . 
  s\u00e1ndor pinter told us , that it will not be necessary as they will not dig as deep . 
  ** these were the most densely populated parts ** this contradicts to what janos lazar said about the depth of certain sections of the fence . 
  if what he said is true , then it once again raises the issue of the archaeological supervision . 
  `` in hungary it is mandatory for every construction site , where they dig deeper than 50 cm to have archaelogical supervision . '', 
  - said gabor wilhelm , the archaelogical group 's leader at the museum j\u00f3zsef katona , in kecskem\u00e9t . ( ... ), 
  ** why is monitoring important ? 
  ** `` the hungarian-serbian border cuts across several archaeological sites . 
  the area was at one time the most densely populated area of the present-day hungary '' - said g\u00e1bor wilhelm . 
  the [ hunnic golden hoard of nagyszeksos ] ( https://www.pinterest.com/pin/552887291731121173/ ) and the kelebia silver hoard were found in that area . 
  `` csongrad county has thousands of archaeological sites - said joseph szarka , head of the archaelogical department of the museum ferenc mora , in szeged - and the possible damages caused by the fence building depend only on the actual construction techniques . 
  the major works are serious risks . '', 
  if you have many difficult access sections which require smaller ( and easier ) fence on the archaeological sites ( and the fence does not penetrate half a meter deeper ) , then of course there is no need for archaeological supervision , but the chance for this is virtually zero - said g\u00e1bor lass\u00e1nyi , the association of hungarian archaeologists president . 
  ( ... ) the government therefore could only start without the archaeological supervision , if the fence comply with the half meter limit . 
  ( ... ) ( ... ) ( * in the next part an architect claims that archaelogists just slow down work , while an archaelogist claims the opposite . 
  after that ; the conclusion . 
  * ) no loophole to avoid the heritage protection rules . 
  if someone put down one and a half meter deep columns , those columns may violate an [ arpad-era ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%81rp%c3%a1d_dynasty ) village in that area . 
  our questions sent to prime minister 's office . 
  if they respond , this article will be updated . 
  what about [ them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_communist_parties_represented_in_european_parliament ) ? 
  it 's just 15 mep . 
  i really do n't want to get involved this debate ( with all its butts and hurts * ) , but it 's not a universal rule of the world , that if the usa , germany or the uk do something , then that is the democratic thing to do . 
  that is why i do n't respond to the `` tell this ... '' answer , because i do n't consider that a valid argument . 
  i do believe that no one should ban parties based upon prejudices . 
  it 's like the presumption of innocence for parties . 
  you can ban a party if it starts to organize a militia or tries to stage a coup , but you should n't ban a party because of its ideology or name . 
  and iirc there are many [ nazi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_neo-nazi_organizations ) and [ communist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_communist_parties ) parties around the world . 
  oh , just 4 % . 
  then it 's okay .
