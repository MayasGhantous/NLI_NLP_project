  you know what ? 
  why do n't you catch them all , and put them into camps ? 
  after all it 's better to be safe than sorry , amiright ? 
  i would like to reintroduce an ancient custom in hungary . 
  back in the 9th century , when a leader failed in his office he was ritually executed . 
  i am sure , that only the most dedicated politicians would remain in politics , if we reintroduce this . 
  i think those has nothing to do in legal politics who wants to decide who has a place in legal politics . 
  banning parties is not european and not democratic . 
  there are communists and nazis in this world , and until they follow the rules and obey the law you have to tolerate them , because they have the same rights as you . 
  not just take , but demand . 
  in hungary for many cheese still means the [ pork cheese ] ( http://roolnet.hu/roolnet_kep/7392497/7392506/kep&amp;ext=.jpg ) , which is not a cheese at all ( thank god , as it would be disgusting ) , but a cold cut . 
  the main hungarian milk-cheese is the [ trappista ] ( http://aprosef.hu/sites/default/files/phasephotos/2013/img_5747.jpg ) , which in theory is the [ port salut ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/port_salut ) , but in reality it is not . 
  we also have a wide variety of processed cheeses and the [ pannonia ] ( http://m.cdn.blog.hu/et/etelrendeles/image/sajt.jpg ) , which is an emmentaler . 
  anyway , [ how much cheese is too much cheese ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/bmpwgoczk84 ), 
  [ the alps-adriatic working group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_alps-adriatic_working_group ) ? 
  i did n't mean that . 
  it was more than the crown , he was unable to govern hungary , and the empire was almost disintegrated . 
  he realized that and he died as a broken man . 
  just look up in the wikipedia , dude , instead of just trying to find something to disagree . 
  when habsburg emperors tried to govern the hungarian kingdom as a province of their unified empire , they were always failed . 
  these failures then led to compromises with hungary in 1608 , 1711 , 1790 and the last time in 1867 . 
  at least you can tell those people 's ancestors ' political stance . 
  yes , before 1848 . 
  he changed his opinion later because he realized he was wrong , and did n't change that opinion , even if that meant to live his life in immigration . 
  before 1848 who tried that was imprisoned , after that called a socialist , anarchist etc. 
  and was crushed , like at the blood-red thursday in 1912 ( socialist rally for reforms in budapest , 6 dead , several hundreds wounded . ), 
  landowners ruled hungary until 1945 and they followed their own interests , not national ones . 
  that is not taught in school . 
  13th century in school : golden bull , mongol invasion , the `` second foundation of hungary '' after the invasion , weakening of the royal power , ladislaus the cuman and the oligarchs . 
  i am afraid that romania is not as important in hungarian thinking as the romanians beleive . 
  the first real mention of the romanians is the budai nagy antal revolt ( which is seen as a justified revolt against the wealthy landowners ) . 
  romanian migration is a university level thing , and academic consensus still holds what you said , i think . 
  the idea of the united states of greater austria came from lajos kossuth , who proposed to transform the habsburg empire into a `` danubian state '' , a federal state ( preferably a republic ) with autonomous regions . 
  [ eng ] ( https://www.ohio.edu/chastain/dh/danconf.htm ) the forced magyarization was the policy of the landowner gentry ( the same gentry who shot on hungarians as well as slovakians , only they called them socialist or anarchist and not ethnic extremists ) and not kossuth , who was a liberal statesman . 
  maybe . 
  honestly , i am not up to the task to find a good english source . 
  indeed . 
  i meant that they were fired on hungarian , slovakian and romanian etc. 
  protesters as well . 
  sure , slovakians can say that it was the part of their national struggle for freedom , but what should the hungarians say ? 
  it 's a well established fact in the scientific community based on archeological findings , examination of geographical names and tax lists . 
  i can find hungarian sources ( kocsis karoly , ethnic geography lecture , university of miskolc - as a first google hit in hungarian * ) , but i bet that you wo n't like a hungarian source , because it 's `` biased '' , and want me to find an english one , but i am not an expert , so it would n't be an easy task for me . 
  you 're wrong . 
  why did joseph ii do what he did in 1790 , if it was just a technicality ? 
  a slovakian guy badmouthing a hungarian national hero just for fun ? 
  - business just as usual . 
  it was more than 3 weeks ago , and it was a riot in the immigration camp ( which was handled by the police well ) , not an everyday routine . 
  since then police presence in the area was reinforced and all is quiet . 
  the new problem , that foreign students of the debrecen university were beaten because of their color . 
  it is a medieval tradition , that the hungarians are the descendants of the huns , but in reality we are not . 
  maybe it was a pr action in the 9th century . 
  but we are not descent from the magyars , we are the magyars ( same language etc. 
   the magyars , the invading group you speak of , was very small in number , but aggressive enough to have their language and culture predominate . 
  i do n't want to start an endless quarel , but if hungarians were aggressive , how we could n't assimilate every other nations in the carpathian basin ? 
  the truth that we came in , we liked what we saw , we stayed and we wo n't go anywhere . 
  there were more hungarian in the carpathian basin until the ottoman wars than non-hungarian . 
  it was that 150 years of fight which decreased the hungarian population from 3.2 million to 1.5 million and increased the non-hungarian from 1 million to 1.7 million . 
   that same migration period that led to the existence of a hungarian nation . 
  hungarian nation existed before that , just not here . 
  we even understand our first survived hungarian language speech , written in the 12th century with ease . 
  anyway migration period led to the existence of most of the european nations , even italy was invaded many times . 
  that is the reason why he used this expression . 
   wo n't become occupied for 400 years turks , or rather ottomans were here for 150 years ( cca . 
  1540-1690 ) , not 400 . 
  hungarian kingdom stopped them from 1300 's to 1526 , after that we fought them as the part of the habsburg empire ( but still as the hungarian kingdom , under a habsburg king ) until 1699 . 
  in this sense maria theresia was hungary . 
  she only ruled hungary as the queen of hungary . 
  every habsburg ruler except joseph ii was crowned and ruled as a hungarian king , took an oath on the hungarian constitution and had separate governmental institutions in the hungarian kingdom . 
  anyway the best thing happened with transylvania in 896 . , 
   didnt hungary tried with its minorities to do the sameas england with wales , scotland and ireland ? 
  to tell the truth it was more like if an english ruled ireland would have rule scotland and wales . 
  czechs and slovaks usually do n't beleive it , but the hungarian ruling class was not just against the minorities , it was tried to oppress every movement and group ( ethnicity was irrelevant ) which tried to change the status quo . 
  although serfdom was abolished in hungary in 1848 , the status of the agricultural workers was terrible until 1945 . 
  the farm servants ( who had no land and was employed by yearly contracts ) had almost no rights . 
  if they started anything to defend themselves , like a strike for their wages , gendarmes immediately appeared and crushed them . 
  in many cases with volley fire . 
  there is a good hungarian non-fiction book about the farm servants , written by gyula illyes in the 1930 's the people of the puszta , [ here ] ( http://www.hungarianreview.com/article/people_of_the_puszta ) is an excerpt in english . 
  hungarians today usually forget that almost a million people lived under such circumstances , which were only abolished by the communists . 
  as our culture based on the 19th century noble , gentry culture too , most of the hungarians behave like a descendants of the landowner gentry and forget the sufferings of the poorer two-thirds of the country before 1945 . 
  our greatest national heroes either died in immigration after a failed revolution against the habsburgs ( rakoczi , kossuth ) or in a battle against the habsburgs ( petofi ) , or executed after a failed revolution or rebellion ( 13 martyrs of arad , martinovics , wesselenyi , zrinyi , frangepan etc. ), 
  so no , it is not common . 
  i do n't know the hungarian redditors sentiments , but the average hungarian is a `` kuruc '' and not a `` labanc '' . 
  translation : `` mikl\u00f3s solt\u00e9sz : an occupation takes place in europe mikl\u00f3s solt\u00e9sz called the mass migration a well-structured business , planned settlement , the occupation of europe . 
  the under-secretary gave an interview to the napi gazdas\u00e1g ( `` economy daily '' ) , this monday , and he said : `` the current situation is not a refugee issue , but a new migration period , which will have serious consequences not only for europe but for the whole world . 
  this can cripple even a great power economically . '', 
  cooperation is needed according to him it would be necessary not only to hungary and some other member states , but the whole european union together , efficiently and quickly take action to resolve the situation . 
  as he said , the government do not see any willingness for that on the part of the bureaucratic machine in brussels , that is why it is important to close the borders temporary . 
  it is important to the work of ngos according to the under-secretary europe is muslimizing , but islam as a religion should not be hurt , but we need to see that european culture is based on the judeo-christian culture . ( ... ) '', 
  not so fun fact , but until ~ ~ 1878 ~ ~ 1907 in the hungarian kingdom , the legal status of the children , house servants and hired agricultural workers were the same ; they were all under the total control of the landowner , who was their `` pater familias '' or something like that . 
  maybe this has something to do with that otrok thing . 
  it 's because your sea is black . 
  [ come on . 
  we also have cool pictures .
