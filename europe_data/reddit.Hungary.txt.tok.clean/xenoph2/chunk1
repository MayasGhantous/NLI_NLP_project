the damage of time , the creepiness ... 
  but of course , they renovate it almost non-stop . 
  btw fun fact : nothing in budapest can be taller than the parliament building ( 96-ish m ) , by law . 
  i thought we were talking about chants ? 
  but in the end ... it does n't even matter . 
  by freakin ' invading it ? 
  i mean one of you * did * conquer most of europe for a while last century . 
  no good alternatives . 
  the previous government , the current opposition , [ was utter shit too ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_protests_in_hungary ) . 
  polak wegner dwa bratanki ( or something like that ) !, 
  thanks , i 'll remember that . 
  great britain and former colonies ? ... 
  ah right , that makes much more sense . 
  kinder surprise ? 
  i think we 're past the point where they can just be ignored to be dealt with . 
   just ignore them and let them grow , eh ? 
  what could they `` accomplish '' ? 
  would they destabilize the region any significantly ? 
  is hungary a boulder ? 
  or a decapitated hippo ? 
  was hoping/expecting to see this . 
  where are you planning on doing so ? 
  [ reminds me of civ i. 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b2vm5sh.jpg ) on a more serious note , things must be rough there if they 're already playing the nuclear card ( as if [ mad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mutual_assured_destruction ) was n't a thing , either ) . 
  well that 's a level head response if i ever saw one . 
  it 's simple , on the grand scheme of things they only care about eastern europe as a buffer . 
  * peace in our time . 
  ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ russia . 
  it 's like the albanian version of the swiss army knife . 
  blame benelux !, 
  i thought they were in that order ... !, 
  [ yup ] ( http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28847955 ), 
  139/141 , mixed up belgium and netherlands ^ ^ ^ ^ two ^ ^ ^ ^ times ... 
  so then it 's sort of like being austrian vs being german ? 
  sharing most of the culture and language but still different on their own merits ? 
  march 15th , when we tried to secede from austria in the [ 1848 revolution ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1848 ) . 
  ( did n't really work out until 19 years later when we finally entered [ a union of sorts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austria-hungary ) with them ), 
  i wonder , how strong is national identity in moldova ? 
  do people think about themselves as moldovan or romanian after all ? 
   the difference equals to the annual electricity consumption of hungary . 
  would n't call that insignificant . 
  to ( kind of ) put it into perspective our 4-reactor nuclear plant only covers 40 % of that . 
   get the full story  subscribe or log in are you kidding me ? 
  yeah , might as well stay there . 
  medics with food , now that 's sinergy . 
  wonder if it 's the same guy as [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2dtg8q/hungarys_illiberalism_should_not_go_unchallenged/cjsx1ym ) , both 0 days old . 
  i think he meant the overall impression of that particular area . 
  had the same feeling about scotland when i traveled ( from oban to glasgow ) by train there . 
  it 's kind of like a mini taj mahal without the minarets and the reflecting pool . 
  at least that was my first impression looking at it . 
  you really should repost that comment as a text post in / r/hungary for anyone checking in to ask around about budapest , should n't be buried in a 7-karma thread 's comment section imo . 
  thanks i do n't want little russia over here . 
  limiting freedom of speech can not turm out to our favour . 
  the gell\u00e9rt hill itself is pretty nice as well , worths wandering around in . 
  [ kind of like a tiny elevated forest in the middle of the city ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hcjpnwt.jpg ) , with vistas . 
  ( [ here are some more pics if anyone 's interested ] ( http://kepek.origo.hu/galleriesdisplay/gdisplay?xml=/0908/gell_200986125537/gallery.xml&amp;rovat=utazas ) ), 
  [ here 's mine ] ( http://i.imgur.com/re7geuc.gif ) , red where i stayed at intentionally , orange where i just traveled through . 
  i wonder what we send , rubik cubes and medics maybe ? 
  the one which eiffel designed is the [ nyugati p\u00e1lyaudvar ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rjqvapb.jpg ) ( western railway stn . 
  ) , easy to get to with the 4 & 6 tram lines . 
  i love that there 's a building height limit , 90ish metres , the height of the parliament building . 
  it just keeps the city view pristine . 
  i 'd assume the rankings are calculated including the individual european countries , right ? 
  how would they look like if the eu did n't `` race '' against itself ? 
  such projects would really bring europeans closer together , literally and figuratively as well . 
  oh i see where you were coming from , it makes sense that way . 
  whichever you prefer , it 's your collection after all !, 
  '' [ budapest ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andr%c3%a1ssy_%c3%bat ) , including the banks of the danube , the [ buda castle quarter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buda_castle#mediaviewer/file:river_beatrice_%28ship,_2007%29_005.jpg ) and andr\u00e1ssy avenue '' ( ends in [ heroes ' square ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andr%c3%a1ssy_avenue#mediaviewer/file:h%c5%91s%c3%b6k_tere_%c3%a9jszaka_-_budapest.jpg ) ) are also hungarian cultural sites ( listed as one i guess ? ), 
  along with [ two more ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_world_heritage_sites_in_hungary ) less known ones . 
  in the works : army olympics ? 
  would n't be a few politicians working together with lots of great minds be the ideal ( most efficient/proficient ) formula ? 
  yeah that 's what i meant . 
  are the finnish forests ok ? 
  [ hubs ? 
  the scaring off putin part , that is, 
  at least there 's [ eurovelo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurovelo_6 ) connection !, 
  as an eu citizen i only need a id card to enter the uk , it 's not much of a hassle on a personal level . 
  it could definitely happen , for the better of europe , but in steps . 
  there should be more regional cooperation and integration ( eg . 
  [ v4 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visegr%c3%a1d_group ) , scandinavia , german states ) first . 
  cool , thanks !, 
  felt the same about debrecen , [ the main square ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qskptlq.jpg ) with the temple is iconic for it . 
  yeah , for mid - to close ranges air travel is n't nearly as effective as they advertise it to be . 
  usually when i fly i spend at least half a day with traveling . 
   a lot faster than a car . 
  and you can relax instead of driving , too . 
  oh right , skipped that part somehow . 
  count me in !, 
  there should be more regional cooperation and integration ( eg . 
  [ v4 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visegr%c3%a1d_group ) , scandinavia , german states ) prior to establishing a federal state . 
  ca n't we get to most of these via [ eurail ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurail ) already ? 
  i do prefer traveling by train rather than by plane if i 'm in no particular rush , though . 
  i wish it would only remind us of the roman empire , really . 
  because a star is a more universal symbol than a bundle of wheat in a circle ( that was used in every single communist coat of arms during their `` reign '' over eastern europe ) maybe ? 
  it did matter if it reminded half of europe of something . 
  that 's reminiscent of a [ communist-style herald ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:coat_of_arms_of_hungary_%281949-1956%29.svg ) , no thanks . 
  he even looks like a dwarf with that helmet . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_by_country#table ) ( 2010 ) it says 82.1 % , the article says an un estimate is 70 % . 
  wonder what the points they constructed these along are . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_by_country#table ) ( 2010 ) it says 82.1 % , the article says an un estimate is 70 % .
