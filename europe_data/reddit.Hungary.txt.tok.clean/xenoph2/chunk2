  i wouldnt 've thought so either but it 's significantly higher than 50 % it seems . 
  and the map was made before the crisis apparently , uploaded in july 2013 . 
  iceland can into imperialism !, 
  is that some sort of snail speciality ? 
  not part of oecd ? 
  glass twice as big as it should be . 
  the next war wo n't be that bad . 
  the one after , where a more or less developed china will play a key role , will be nasty . 
  yep , eu is primarily important for the us as a continental buffer to russia ( trade is a factor too but what do we have that they can not get , maybe for a bit higher price ) . 
  making the eu formidable in all traditional aspects of a state ( especially militarily ) should be a higher priority than closer ties with the us . 
  0.8 % of gdp stronk !, 
  you 're welcome !, 
  no , [ we did get most of the hungarian-populated territories back during wwii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vienna_awards ) . 
  should we won it , there would n't be 2-3million speakers outside of our borders now . 
  maybe he was waiting for something like this his whole life , let him have his moment !, 
  no probs , always happy to help those who are in need . 
  the [ northern mountains ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_hungarian_mountains ) are a great area to ride around at , did it several times . 
  the only thing i can really think of is that we gained international recognition with the [ revolution of ' 56 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956 ) and with opening our borders to austria in '89 as the first to do so in the eastern bloc . 
  communism really was n't much more than wasting state resources for stupid projects like trying to grow orange in the continental climate of hungary or producing random wares just for the sake of producing something ( really , it was a thing ) because of the ideology that everyone has to work - they created pseudo-jobs for everyone so to say . 
  thinking of this , maybe the very low unemployment rate and the security it usually gave to people , especially in the less advanced east , was the only positive aspect of the whole show - if we do n't think about how efficient or useful the actual duties were . 
  there are approximately 12-3 million hungarians in europe ( and another 2 million in the us ) but the 2-3 million are in neighbouring countries [ because we lost wwii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trianon_treaty ) . 
  apart from the united kingdom i 'm not really aware of any significant eurosceptics around , are there ? 
  we do need more integrated eu military with an agressive great power ( russia ) in our vicinity though . 
  the bicycle road-network has improved significantly in the latest years , both around the country and in budapest , partly due to critical mass itself , but it 's not perfect yet of course . 
  i 'm not , for example [ critical mass ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/critical_mass_%28cycling%29#scale ) is quite big here . 
  also , apart from recreation , there 's a significant number of people in rural areas using bicycles for their everyday business ( work , shopping , travel between villages ) as a cheap alternative to cars ( this of course applies to cities as well , but to a lesser extent , especially in the capital ) . 
  why would you want to get rid of the west ? 
  if europe wants to have weight on the international scene , it has to have at least eu-degree cooperation . 
  otherwise it 's just a bunch of weak nation states that can be thrown around however the us and russia wants it to . 
  we have to rely on each other . 
  the world 's progressing towards semi - or continental-scale integration and that 's the only viable future for europe either . 
  we have to put our differences and the past aside and concentrate on what 's better for the region as a whole . 
  if we want to have a european future , that is . 
  i think we all know how 50 years of the reds helped our countries ' progression . 
  apart from nostalgic pensioners , there is n't much sympathy here for them . 
  but you have your [ craiova grop ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/craiova_group ) with bulgaria and serbia, 
  the turning point was actually 1981 , long before eu . 
  [ here 's an annotated graph ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_hungary#/media/file:hungary_1910-2009.png ) showing population in the area of today 's hungary . 
  also worths noting that we have [ over 2million ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarians ) hungarians living in neighbouring countries . 
  yeah we do n't . 
  but some politicians really want us to . 
  then they will riot and turn your country into a sweden . 
  very good point indeed . 
  good thing hungary does n't let it happen . 
  we 'll do our best, 
  good luck with that . 
  i think croatia having no percentage means they made this before your accession to the eu . 
  [ mirv ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/peacekeeper-missile-testing.jpg ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multiple_independently_targetable_reentry_vehicle, 
  why thank you . 
  could someone calculate how many of these projects coul 've been built with all the money sunk into greece recently ? 
  they could never win a conventional war against any of these targets , hell they ca n't even get a torn up country like syria for themselves . 
  it 's all to gather more braindead for their cause . 
   tunisia will close down 80 mosques ** that were outside state control ** for allegedly inciting violence now that makes it much more understandable , good on them . 
  an * homage * to some * great * mods on here i believe . 
  maybe backlashes on their religion is the only way these nutjobs will start thinking about going around killing peaceful people . 
  then again , i do n't know how will this happen in practice in a 98 % muslim country . 
  it certainly sends a message though . 
  that 's exactly the reason why i started looking for aquifer maps of europe , on the apropo of turning aquifers off in my new df game . 
  [ on this wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ogallala_aquifer ) of an american aquifer it states that it 'd fill up in 6,000 + years from precipitation would it get depleted . 
  [ source is here ] ( http://www.bgr.bund.de/en/themen/wasser/veranstaltungen/workshop_ihme_2013/ihme-2013_inhalt.html ) - international hydrogeological map of europe, 
  seems to have been used as last resort tbh , completely irrelevant . 
  i mean it could , but ... forint stronk ! ( ? ), 
  \u00bf que ? 
   the number of refugees entering hungary increased from a total of 2,000 in 2012 to 54,000 in january this year , which makes hungary the eu member-state that , after sweden , receives the largest number of refugees in proportion to its population . 
  then these would probably all move on into the rest of the eu . 
  same situation as in the mediterranean , hungary at least tries to do something about it . 
  [ looking at this map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u4gpdzy.png ) i doubt hungarians should be your greatest concern . 
  besides , who would really want to emigrate to the northernmost islamic country ? 
  a grand sample of one, 
  must be the descendants of a western alexandros, 
  `` fresh 'n' dense air at high altitudes '' - fee, 
  i 'm getting tired of balkan/east europe countries trying to drag us down to their perceived level tbh . 
  death penalty is bad = balkan country makes perfect sense, 
  keyword : apparently, 
  yay , maybe we 'd have a chance to attend again , finally, 
  yup , you are 12 . 
  are you 12 ? 
  yeah do n't mess with boars , especially if they are with their young . 
  unless you have a tree to climb nearby . 
  * now * you know, 
   he said , as he vowed to recover hundreds of bodies from a boat that sank last month that 'll help them !, 
  no dragging down allowed in the premises !, 
   eastern european [ that would n't fit all in the fun ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_europe ), 
  how come the alpes of austria are n't more suitable for wind energy ? 
  i like the reasons you brought up . 
  and some of that sweet east prussian clay ? 
  do n't you think a more properly integrated europe would have a better chance standing up against them than all the small states one by one ? 
  there 's a good reason russia supports right wing movements in europe . 
  divide et imperat . 
  are there many of them out there ? 
  i mean , compared to pakistanis for example ? 
  forever the playground of the us and russia , sounds good !, 
  with a continent this historically and culturally rich , it needs to be given much more time . 
  and should develop organically , through higher regional cooperation/integration first . 
  where 's alexander when you need him ? 
   any reunification would happen without transnistria . 
  yeah , that makes sense . 
  did n't mean i 'm against it in theory , could n't really think of anything in `` moldova proper '' that would n't fit culturally in romania . 
  wondering though how would the eu react to one of the poorest regions in europe getting attached to it . 
  holy shit you are a butthurt and sad one .
