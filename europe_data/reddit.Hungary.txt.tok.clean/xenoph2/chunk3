  go read up on how horthy refused to deport them until the nazis occupied hungary . 
  g'day . 
   do you have any example of romanian government oppressing the hungarian minority in any way in the last 70 years ? 
  [ do you even read my replies ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/362p04/the_relief_map_of_europe_created_by_anton_balazh/crba8me ) i 've had acquitances from transylvania and as i said in another comment you did n't really read , you do n't play as dirty anymore since you do n't need to . 
  the anti-hungarian sentiment is still alive and kicking , for example just go ask a romanian about the almost purely hungarian transylvania 's autonomy . 
  or just read 98 % of romanians ' comments on internet forums regarding hungary . 
  and you just keep trying to taint hungary as a defense mechanism apparently , i 'm not even sure why i keep replying at this point . 
  are you shifting between past and present ? 
  clearly , after a successful romanianization programme , there are n't too many hungarians left in romania . 
  you simply * do n't need * to play that dirty anymore . 
  and again , would love to see proper sources of your random accusations . 
  [ minorities in hungary enjoy full rights  ( http://countrystudies.us/hungary/50.htm )  the constitution , as well as a sizable body of law , guarantees the cultural rights of recognized national minorities . 
  even the gypsies have a `` national governing body '' now . 
   well ... 
  i see nothing extreme over there . . well , just ignoring all the things you did for the last 50-80 years to hungarian minorities works out fine i guess ? 
  you are free to provide reliable sources for your massacre/etc claims but [ magyarization ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyarization ) was n't more than cultural ( apart from one instance in 1907 against slovaks ) and definitely did not alter the cultural palette as radically as romanianization . 
  and about the `` get over it '' part , if you were to state false things about my country under the cover of a belgian flag i 'll be damn sure to call you out on it . 
  the only story regarding gypsies here i heard was about a family that was flown to sweden then came back because they did n't like the place for some reason . 
  oh really ? 
  what about [ romanianization ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanianization )  while romania included large national minorities , the 1923 constitution declared the country to be a nation-state and it continued on :  during the autumn in 1944 , after the withdrawal of the hungarian military forces and administration from transylvania , sz\u00e9kelyland was engaged and pillaged by the romanian gendarmerie and volunteers . 
  even the soviets had too much of your shit :  however , on 12 november 1944 the soviet red army expulsed the returning romanian authorities from northern transylvania with reference to the massacres committed by members of iuliu maniu 's so-called maniu guard , and the romanian authorities were not allowed to return until the government of petru groza was formed on 6 march 1945 . 
  and after wwii :  since 1947 the romanian authorities gradually eliminated the old hungarian institutions ... the major part of hungarian intellectual and spiritual leaders were arrested and convicted for years . 
  on the other hand , during the communist era the former civil organization possibilities of the interwar period were eliminated . 
  romanianization of transylvania was particularly intense during ceausescu :  after nicolae ceau\u0219escu came to power in the 1960s , the assimilationist drive was pursued with new vigor . 
  the remaining minority `` privileges '' were lost , hungarian representation in the local bureaucracies was limited to the proportion of hungarians in the total population . 
   mass resettlement of moldavians and wallachian romanians into transylvania took place . 
  hungarian intellectuals were coerced into leaving transylvania and were compelled to take jobs in non-hungarian areas which also contributed to romanianization . 
  and these are only the well known actions/policies . 
  you did all you could to force the decline of your mostly hungarian minorities ... 
  [ bad parties happened man . 
  i see . 
  but your previous statement 's just is n't true . 
  even in 1910 , 10 years before trianon , [ the kingdom of hungary had 50 % hungarians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:trianon_consequences.png ) ( with the mostly croat/serb croatia included ) and about 30-35 % hungarians in transylvania too . 
  flair checks out !, 
  been to d\u00fcsseldorf , it felt quite neat , tidy , cozy etc. 
  would you say it ( or k\u00f6ln ) 's a typical german city ? 
  i 've been attending uni in the viiith district and most of the time i saw an appropriate number of policemen patroling about . 
  i think after the previous government messed up awfully and orb\u00e1n got supermajority , he 's been away in his own little world pretty much . 
  he campaigned as a family oriented moderate conservative-christian before iirc . 
  but not of imported hate ? 
   carabinieri paramilitary police is n't carabineri just italian for regular police ? 
  * ah i see , thanks !, 
  [ yeah , really . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/34i311/hungarys_orban_climbs_down_on_death_penalty_amid/ ) sure , he 's not promising as a democratic statesman but the coin has two sides . 
  most of his ideas do n't and should not be tolerated i agree on that though . 
  orban stepped back with most of his policies when met with eu responses but that does n't get upvoted as much around here . 
  would be interesting to have transnistria in the eu . 
  but please no more hexes, 
  reminds me of the [ crusader kings main menu screen ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ndoihsr.jpg ) . 
  that 's ... exactly what i meant ? 
  well can * it * take it ? 
  one could say , these modifications would have a * common * theme then ? 
  ah sorry , it was from [ this article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principality_of_transylvania_%281570%e2%80%931711%29#demographics ) , i replied to another comment beforehand . 
  i was questioning the authenticity and objective tone of your article , there are always several sources for each time period obviously . 
  i do n't think the two countries ' people are all settled on the issue but we should look further already , thinking in european scopes and not nation states . 
  that 's so 20th century . 
  i think it 's something along the lines of  immigrant : `` we cool ? '', 
  citizen : `` hell yea ! '', 
  if this conversation is realistic , you 're sweden . 
  you got it baby !, 
  yep , this is the key point . 
  romanian sources say romanians were in majority and hungarian sources say hungarians were . 
  wo n't dispute the authenticity of a table with a silly disclaimer of `` hungarian population : 55 % ( with seklers ) '' though . 
  none of these change the fact that * de jure * and for most of the time * de facto * , transylvania belonged to hungary during all this time ( with significant hungarian population as the middle - and upper classes of society ) , which was the original point . 
  well ... 
  if you read closely , romanian sources say romanians were in majority and hungarian sources say hungarians were . 
  i could even count 1 vs 3 with my colonist hands !, 
  none of these change the fact that * de jure * and for most of the time * de facto * , transylvania belonged to hungary during all this time ( with * significant * hungarian population , mind you , as the middle - and upper classes of society ) , which was the original point . 
  ah i see , the period you describe was a political turmoil as the habsburgs tried to handle hungary as reconquered lands but after [ several ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kuruc ) [ uprisings ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%a1k%c3%b3czi%27s_war_of_independence ) it culminated in the [ pragmatica sanctio ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pragmatic_sanction_of_1713#internal_recognition ) `` under which the habsburg monarch was to rule hungary * not as emperor , but as a king subject to the restraints of hungary 's constitution and laws * '' . 
  in turn this was a precursor of what , after the failure of the [ war of independence of 1848 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1848 ) culminated in [ the compromise of 1867 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austro-hungarian_compromise_of_1867 ) where austria-hungary became a personal union . 
  i hope that answer was more or less relevant this time around !, 
  and if it was n't you with the insta-downvote then i apologize . 
  i do , in fact [ during that period ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principality_of_transylvania_%281570%e2%80%931711%29 ) transylvania enjoyed the greatest degree of independence from ottoman/habsburg influence of all the territories of the kingdom of hungary . 
  ~ ~ * your instant downvote 2 minutes after i posted this shows me you did n't even bother to skim through what i linked . 
  talk about level headed discussion ! ~ ~, 
  [ are you trying to pull a fyrom here ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dacians ) and yes , last i checked it was [ over 1000 years . 
  ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1920-895 ) or if we go by your understanding of cultural continuity , [ well over 1000 years . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/huns#unified_empire_under_attila ), 
  that looks ... reasonable, 
  1000 years vs your 90 , we 're still in the lead !, 
  sorry but we 'll stay . 
  technically , we were in europe [ much earlier than that ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_prehistory#original_homeland_.28c._800_bc.c2.a0.e2.80.93_before_600_ad.29 ) . 
   sorry for being less polite myself , i know you 're not doing it just to be an ass . 
  no worries , glad we wrapped this one up fast . 
  i tried to make my point clear and as polite as i could make it to be , sorry if i did n't succeed . 
  and yes , i am hungarian , so let 's circlejerk about romania-hungary hate instead . 
  i 'm aware of the significant portion of romanians in the sub but i believe this would fit much better in / r/romania or / r/pics than in / r/europe as most people come here for ( inter ) national/europe related discussion and news . 
  pretty much everywhere the red army pushed through , in hungary too . 
  hopefully next election . . but the alternatives are n't great either . 
  could we just have a remove orb\u00e1n one please ? 
  reminds me of the phrase `` you are only as strong as your weakest link '' . 
  wonder how will this energy union affect russia 's influence on the eu . 
   if the uk leaves , consider that the end of the eu . 
  russia would be ecstatic . 
  i take this is the spiritual successor of [ critical mass ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/critical_mass_%28cycling%29#scale ) after it reached its goal ? 
  why was n't i aware of this !, 
  the actual tables are on page 49 .
