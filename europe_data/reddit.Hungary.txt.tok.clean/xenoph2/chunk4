  close regional cooperation should be the base of a unified europe . 
  belgium 's anti-tourism agency ? 
  that 's vice versa though . 
  i would say much more western than the rest of the east . 
  erdogan is pushing you away from europe though , hopefully only temporarily . 
  like watching fish in a tank . 
  so what alternative would you suggest ? 
  because , nukes aside , france on its own would not be a global player at all . 
   he reminded that the preparation of the project is taking place on three channels . 
  the first was the agreement with the russians . 
  ** the second was the approval of the deal by the european commission ( in which hungary has taken a huge step forward today ) ** and the third part is the environmental permitting process by local authorities . 
  so it is eu-approved after all ? 
  and there are several casualties on the bicycle roads .

   if you follow the michel thomas school of language learning , you can gain a base in any romance language ( read : portuguese , romanian , spanish , italian , romansch , catalonian , spanish etc ) of about 1,000 or 2,000 words just by learning how to recognise all of the latin ( norman french ) loan words from this period , which takes about 30 minutes . 
  this sounds quite interesting , might will look into it . 
  nice , i 'll take two . 
  yeah i did check what it meant , seems slightly odd to use a french phrase though .

  the greeks and italians obviously have deeper roots in european history than hungarians . 
  nice banter m8 !, 
  the hungarian homeland is around the urals so technically we could say we have been in europe from 2000 + bc . 
  if that theory fits better . 
  and yeah , european history might not be important to you but for us it is , especially nowadays when plenty of people try to stomp on it . 
  400-710 not quite close, 
  except it 's not . 
  the hungarians were in europe [ from 400-670 ad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_prehistory#/media/file:migration_of_hungarians.jpg ) , while islam first appeared [ in 710 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_europe ), 
  well it goes quite a ways back , from the 9-10th centuries ? 
  russia had feudalism instead of iqta , christianity instead of islam , european customs among the country 's nobles ... 
  the turks have n't really started to europeanize until atat\u00fcrk came along in the 20th century . 
  russia historically and culturally has always been european .

  europe was the barbaric , as you said , and the middle east cultured ... then things went downhill . 
  i really hope we 'll see lots of your examples in the recently migrated population ... 
   he did n't do it to make it more acceptable , but to make it factually accurate might just be the cynic talking from me , but one would think someone living that close to all these muslim/arab people would know the difference , and importance of differentiating , between the two expressions even better ... 
  except there still is quite a difference between the two regarding compatibility with western culture/values . 
  would suggest watching [ this recent zdf documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvwaikoatwm ) about the issue , quite sobering .

  i fear the uk leaving would only achieve an even bigger power disparity in the eu in favor of germany . 
  and even if the eu dissolved somehow , what and how would replace it ? 
  do you have plans for a uk initiative maybe ? 
  you may be overestimating your current role in the eu if you expect to cause a landslide with this move . 
  i support your cause , just the method i 'm a bit sceptical about . 
  what you currently are doing is , if anything , painting them over . 
  would rather if you replaced the rotten parts instead . 
  you 're welcome . 
  transylvania is beautiful . 
  instead of leaving it , the uk should take a more involved role in reforming the eu .
