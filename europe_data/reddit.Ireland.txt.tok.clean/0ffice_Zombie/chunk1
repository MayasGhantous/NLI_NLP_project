nothing at all , they 're still good but the first 3 or 4 really do capture the celtic tiger years while the newer ones follow the economic downturn . 
  the early ross o'carroll kelly novels are a fantastic snapshot of celtic tiger ireland in the late 90 's / early-mid 00 's . 
  the author is a fantastic satirist who really captures the spirit of the time for a small but significant amount of middle and upper class dublin while playing on stereotypes of all sorts . 
  a lot of the jokes will probably go over your head if you 're not irish or have an intimate knowledge of irish culture but many stereotypes of ireland are satirised throughout and as with all stereotypes there 's a hint of truth in each one . 
   but whatever you do , do n't refer to us as being in the british isles . 
  however this is n't ubiquitous . 
  i would n't bat an eyelid if someone said this , i 've also polled quite a few friends and family and the general reaction was `` why are you asking me this ? 
  i do n't care '' . 
  nuts have been outlawed here since 1842 . 
  the parting glass is a little cracker . 
  not sung so often now but you 'd see hear it at the odd wedding or perhaps at the end of a large family gathering . 
  the one thing i 've badly missed since moving away is the green-ness of the country . 
  we 're greener than a lot of places . 
  do n't forget the snickers . 
  she 's the wife of someone important in rovio - the ceo/founder or someone like that so that 's why she is wearing the dress . 
   claiming something that was never theirs the history of the united kingdom in one sentence , everybody . 
  i hitchhiked around france and found it * really * easy to get picked up but everyone who picked me up seemed to do it out of novelty . 
  across the board they all said that it was n't common at all . 
  hitchhiking used to be far more common in ireland than it is now but in certain rural parts you still see it happen . 
  backpackers tend to hitch quite a bit and i 've picked up a handful when i 've been on the west coast of ireland . 
  haha , you can see the exact moment that the celtic tiger hit ireland . 
  i 've gotten return flights london-dublin for # 65 from city . 
  they 're talking total shite , unsurprisingly . 
   the irish guy is wrong and so you reveal yourself as the bigot scumbag you are . 
  what a surprise . 
   perhaps your pro-eu media is telling you that uk is a hellhole for a reason . 
  considering i live in london , i know the exact situation the uk is in . 
  stop reading the daily mail and remove your tinfoil hat , you 'll soon realise that immigrants are n't coming to steal your breakfast from our of your hands . 
   do some research and you will see we are fine and we have the bargaining chip in this procedure . 
  best of luck with that . 
   ** you require the goodwill of the eu ** and there is no point in poking the beast ** when you are negotiating terms ** . 
  since you seem to have missed the point in the two sentences i 've written , i have put some emphasis on the important point . 
  hopefully now it is clearer for you . 
   they want to rush us but we will take our team prompting them to give us better deals to hurry us up with it . 
  with this sort of tactical thinking you should apply to join the department of brexit that is being formed . 
  yep . 
  that 's exactly what i said , you absolute genius . 
  well done . 
   eu members are trying to rush us with it but we can just ignore them . 
  this thinking has gotten you into this mess . 
  i know this will be a painful truth for you but you require the goodwill of the eu and there is no point in poking the beast when you are negotiating terms . 
  you 're grand lad , we can understand it .

  how popular is the eurovision in non-eu countries like israel ? 
  she looks like she is hosting a child 's television show . 
  the best thing about the eurovision is graham 's commentary .

  anyway .

  good looking lad . 
  i live in the uk and they 're mad for saying it over here . 
  you 've read a bunch of stuff that is n't in my posts tbh so i 'll leave it here ...  your anger wo n't change that . 
  i could n't be less angry . 
  if that 's the only thing you believe ireland has thrived off from being a member of the eu then you do n't know much about our little country i 'm afraid . 
  i 'm talking fully fledged modernisation of infrastructure and beyond . 
   ireland is n't in the commonwealth ** at all ** for a starters oh , i think you 'll find that a portion of ireland * is * in the commonwealth . 
   what about norway which does n't want to be part of the eu ? 
  i do n't know enough about norway tbh . 
  yes ? 
  maybe ? 
  i was relating my personal experience living in and having an english parent . 
  you can call it cultural confidence if it will lead to a few less brexitears for yourself . 
   if the uk wanting to be an independent country harks back to the victorian era , then the notion of irish ` reunification ' is held by people stuck in the 1200s . 
  you 've completely missed the point so i 'll spell it out for you - many brexiters seem to think the uk is far more important in the world than it actually is . 
  i think you will find this out when you go off on your own . 
   why would i have been describing ireland ? 
  because you said ...  we have good relationships with many commonwealth countries ; we have historically , culturally and geographically been in between europe and the us . 
  which also could accurately describe ireland . 
  the point i was making , as i said , ireland has thrived within the eu . 
   please explain with examples of how the uk is ` culturally arrogant ' i mean , you voted for brexit , is that not example enough ? 
  the people who i work with who voted for brexit seem to believe in the halcyon days of the united kingdom . 
  i would n't be entirely sure that they know that it 's queen lizzie and not queen victoria on the throne or that the sun has most definitely set on the empire . 
   we have good relationships with many commonwealth countries ; we have historically , culturally and geographically been in between europe and the us . 
  are you describing ireland or the uk mate ? 
  ireland has thrived in the eu . 
  it 's nothing to do with anything you 're saying , the fact is that the uk is too culturally arrogant to be a good fit with the eu . 
  i live in the uk and one of my parents is english so this is based on personal experience . 
  i ca n't help but think that a decade or two isolated in a broken union kingdom on the western edge of europe might do you the world of good . 
   the fact that ireland was the first country to legalize same sex marriage ** due to popular vote ** highlighted the bit you missed out on there . 
  i 'd say only about 50 % of the people who move away from ireland do it for truly economic reasons , the rest just get out of the country for a few years to get some broader experience . 
  obviously , during the downturn the amount moving away for economic reasons would have been higher but i think in general irish people just have a small of amount of cultural wanderlust hungover from the years of emigration due to famine and all that craic .
