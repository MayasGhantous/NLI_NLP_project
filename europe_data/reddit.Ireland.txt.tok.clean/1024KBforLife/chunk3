  asking for the free market without movement is like asking for a car without wheels , it 's not really a car anymore just a metal box . 
  it is annoying how many people do n't get this and are getting touchy about the clarification . 
  if the uk does n't want free movement they do n't want the free market , they want a trade deal . 
  this `` punishment '' narrative is now so strong the eu could given the uk everything it wants and a backrub and people will still think the eu `` punished '' them . 
  add to that there is going to be huge self inflicted economic fallout no matter what deal the uk gets and people looking for scapegoats . 
  makes sense . 
  you ca n't appoint any experts or anyone with concerns from project fear, 
  yep, 
  if someone comes up to you with one of these surveys , you kind of get their trying to create a story with it . 
  you 're option is to play along and mark the box saying you 're scared of refugees and do n't want them or you do n't register anything ( walk way or mark neutral ) or you push back at the person trying to push the narrative . 
  i 'm not saying it 's right but maybe they saw what the survey takers were doing and were annoyed . 
  as my first action , the word kibibyte is banned . 
  i think we needed a bit of diversity . 
  we were just a bunch of miserable , catholic , pale , potato eating , alcoholic builders before the poles came over . 
  if you stand at the counter while it 's made it 's fast food . 
  hey now you 're not allowed to argue with joe duffy style masochism . 
  we 're a bad country , everything is shit and i 'm getting so hot right now . 
  ooohhhh gaaaawd the housing crisis . 
  tax haven implies nothing is made here and it 's all just po boxes . 
  a lot of companies do come here for the tax but they do actually work here too , amazon 's data centre is eight largest ( by volume ) building in the world . 
  we also have the most educated population in europe and speak english . 
  half the population are programmers and the other half are in bio-chem . 
  all that adds up . 
  yeah . 
  the informal measure people often use is the commuter traffic into dublin and apparently it 's chocka-block . 
  probably not 25 % but returning to old levels , low unemployment etc. 
  the thing is irish people are masachists , they love missery . 
  i would like to take personal credit, 
  we got them cheap second hand, 
  if it was n't for america those icelanders would have invaded years ago . 
  i think they 've chosen . 
  they do n't think of themselves as european . 
  it 's mostly bounce back . 
  the educated population , infrastructure etc were still there and did n't need to be regrown . 
  the hardest industry hit was also construction but now there 's a housing shortage . 
  exactly . 
  we 've come a long way in a short time but when the muslim brotherhood of ireland comes on the radio supposedly representing the muslim community saying schools need to be separated into girls schools and boys schools and sex education should be stopped and that their values need to be respected it gets on my nerves . 
  the attitude that we 're being intolerant for doing it . 
  even the moderates are starting to annoy me . 
  practice whatever religion you want in your own home or in your places of worship but do n't expect society to change to suit you . 
  there has been a lot of speculation about northern ireland joining the republic of ireland . 
  this is why it wo n't happen . 
  it 's fine . 
  they put their towels on the servers so it 's ok . 
  coming over here saut\u00e9ing thing , spreading there garlic everywhere . 
  i like my food tasteless and boiled to death , thank you very much . 
  explain northern ireland, 
  change their feelings , hmm . 
  maybe we can shoot rupert murdock . 
  irish . 
  as one french guy told me `` i did n't learn english to speak to the english , i learned english to speak to other people who leaned english [ as a second language ] '', 
  irish all the way . 
  goodthink, 
  we 're kind of a big deal . 
  but it 's not their only job thought . 
  i 'd say a lot of politicians are n't doing anything but i do n't thing sitting there waiting for a vote is the only way they can work , they could be in their offices . 
  i do n't know why you would n't split out northern ireland , they 're part of the uk economy , they do n't even have the same currency . 
  plus it 'd be weird to include them when we 're exporting to the uk and not include them when we 're exporting to belgium . 
  because 1 million northern irish people who 's economy is about to be decimated are citizens of the uk . 
  i really wish dublin had it 's shit more together . 
  i 've heard that companies like google have schemes to get employees to let other employees to stay with them because there is a shortage of housing . 
  dublin has some weird old planning laws that do n't let them build up and fetishise urban sprawl . 
  the government needs to step in and give the dublin planners a slap . 
  huh did n't know that . 
  i knew the eu in generally was a lot more but i really thought the uk was our biggest partner . 
  oh yeah you 're not wrong . 
  in practice unless there is a vote of no confidence or they want to be seen to be there for a vote or questions backbenchers can do what they want . 
  in ireland a lot of backbenchers have side jobs , there seems to be an informal agreement between parties that they do n't outvote them while they 're away . 
  that 's nearly always the way it works but at the moment in ireland there is an unprecedented deadlock where no party could get a majority so ( i think ) they 've agreed to not have a vote of no confidence for a while and are free voting on everything else . 
  there was also an abortion bill where free voting was allowed but those are exceptions rather than the rule . 
  how is junker legitimate ? 
  which queen appointed him , huh ? 
  6 is why farage got out . 
  he 'll come back in about 3 years and say `` aw , you guys fucked it all up , i would n't have done it that way , anyway i 'm back now , vote for me '', 
  and wanting special deals . 
  you need the ministers/senior party members but you only really need the `` backbenchers '' ( unimportant mps ) for votes . 
  a naked junker is flying over on his dragon at the moment . 
  i heard another british outlet say her `` coronation '' today . 
  i think they 're confused with the terminology . 
  us confederate flag on the left , i ca n't id the one under the confederate flag . 
  it 's awful to say but true none the less . 
  a poor person in a rich country is still one of the richest people on earth . 
  all this `` it ca n't get any worse '' because you 're unemployed is so wrong , it can get much much worse . 
  speaking as someone why grew up in similar conditions . 
  it 's funny that all the brexit plans are to basically get as close to being eu members as possible . 
  is that really what the leavers wanted . 
  that 's it , it 's the same with firefighters . 
  they should n't give a shit about gender , just have a fair test and whoever fails fails , whoever passes passes . 
  philosophy is for when you do n't have a simple test . 
  forget the philosophy and just have them all run the same course . 
  we 're islanders and we love the eu, 
  i want them to stop being dicks, 
  is n't denglish just danish anyway, 
  only if you lower the bar, 
  that would make more sense . 
  what 's a `` leftist '' . 
  i 've only been hearing this word the last few months . 
  i 've heard of people on the left or socialists but left ** ist ** s seem to be new . 
  are there right ** ist ** s ? 
  are you new to planet earth ?
