plus the catholic thing and all, 
  we 're supposed to be the randy neighbors fuck off stealing our thing britain :(, 
  `` i 'm going to fire my beans up your backside '' another day in the life of / r/europe, 
  i 'm just saying i would n't vote for nor would a majority in this country because of this reason . 
  i should have explained a bit better, 
  we would n't be entirely free and independent though that 'd be the problem . 
  when we were given semi freedom with home rule it caused a civil war . 
  only ending when both sides united in gaining complete independence democratically . 
  i understand that sorry if i came off as thought it 'd be forced that was n't my intention, 
  it was n't just that we wanted the right to be free . 
  `` ireland unfree shall never be at peace '' are famous lines everyone in the country knows by padraig pearse . 
  sovereignty is what we wanted that 's what i 'd like to remain despite any benefits of a federal eu . 
  heineken is disgusting get a smithwicks in to you, 
  i love the benefits of the eu as is , ireland fought far to long and hard to earn our independence i would n't like to see us give it up . 
  these memes are evolving, 
  you 're exactly right but my intentions are never to find the opinion of the actual country of ireland but our subreddit community . 
  i 've the security options on it so it checks ip duplication preventing 99 percent of people voting twice . 
  plus this was only posted on our sub and it did n't make / r/all or / r/rising so the chances of people seeing it is unlikely, 
  to be fair 31 percent want reform not leave, 
  thanks to all 1069 people who responded you were a great help . 
  thanks / u/tech46 for making the announcement . 
  link to old post is here but i 've taken the poll down https://redd.it/6p9pfs,
