a self-made world leader sounds more attractive but hey . . like trump ? 
  if $ 20m dollar loans were easily turned into billions , then every last businessman on earth with more than $ 20m on hand would be a billionaire, 
  trump and erdogan are both really tall -- in fact , erdogan is so tall , he 's slouching and still is taller than anyone else in the picture, 
   trump looking lost and out of place and trudeau being photogenic af in my day growing up in ballygobackwards , we called that ` standing to attention ', 
  joko widodo does n't look amused at all, 
  reported for spam, 
   i just find it a bit annoying to always see the most stereotypical case of transwoman they can find , instead of the average person . 
  let 's face it : they * are * what the average transwoman look like , or have you not seen the subreddit / r/transpassing ? 
  i 'm guessing you missed this little report [ from the geniuses at princeton university ] ( http://election.princeton.edu/2016/11/06/is-99-a-reasonable-probability/ ), 
  no one is arguing that he has a legal right to do it , just do n't be surprised when entire populations despise this man and you ca n't merely blame it on `` muh anti-semitism '' , because he 's the equivalent of a international homewrecker, 
   wow you really tried hard to make a comment about personal demeanor about politics . 
  she certainly is n't the subject of discussion based on her good looks or charm , let 's just say that, 
   merkel invested in the protection layer after listening to melania about what trump does to her . 
  ... fly her around the world in his private jet , buy her everything , boss everyone around and put her to bed like a champ ? 
  yeah , because * no woman * finds * that * attractive, 
   he 's a poor man 's impression of what a rich man looks like . 
  no one knows his value , but forbes has estimated that he 's worth * at minimum * $ 3bn dollars based on just his known property investments , not even including his assets or stocks and bonds , so i 'd say he 's easily the richest leader in the world who is n't some oil emperor from the middle east or who embezzled his nation 's treasury, 
   he 's a stupid man 's impression of what a genius looks like . 
  i do n't know about you , but becoming a multi-billionaire off of a $ 20m dollar loan and becoming president of the united states on the cheapest campaign in modern history when the * educated experts * gave you a 98.9 % chance of losing does n't strike me as ` stupid ' -- i 'd argue that anyone who think such a person is stupid is in fact quite stupid themselves, 
  what an utterly beautiful backdrop . 
   why do they always use the `` worst '' cases as pictures and examples ? 
  well that was pretty rude if you ask me, 
  i reserve that word to refer to angela merkel and merkel alone, 
  take it to the megathread , you karma-fisher, 
   what politics ? 
  he planned to donate to ngos that aligned with the values he supports . 
  he 's not fucking irish , he needs to stay the fuck out -- what part of that do n't you understand ? 
  i 'm implying that they 'll ban you for implying, 
   but she does n't even acknowledge him because she 's an actual leader in control of the situation having so many economic refugees pour into your country that you do n't even know your own census figures anymore and you burn bridges with all your neighbours to the east is actually not `` in control of the situation '' , it 's actually the sign of being a pathetically weak leader ** for those downvoting me , care to explain how this sort of behaviour exudes strength , especially considering the rest of europe looks at her like a villain ? 
  you ilk downvote , yet you have no proper rebuttals **, 
  hey look , the netherlands is n't so bad afterall !, 
  careful , they 'll literally ban you if you point out too much, 
  ... so 0.004 % of the population ? 
  why is this even a story ? 
   republican/united russia cooperation are you fucking insane ? 
  now the gop and united russia are collaborators ? 
  / r/europe is a crazy , tinfoil-hatted place sometimes, 
  the point is that he does it . 
  that 's just one group . 
  he has no business in irish politics , now does he ? 
   three quarters of the `` anti-globalist '' campaigns are just rehashed antisemitic slurs . 
  til that opposition to the united states of europe and mass immigration is ` anti-semitic ', 
  eh , the guy before him linked to snopes , and people here link to crappy sources all the time, 
  til the majority of the irish nation is ` far-right ' because they do n't agree with some far-left , radical perspective on abortion, 
  i 'm really beginning to notice a bromance going on here ( or at least a [ daddy/son ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/ryykhaarpd46jefcgda_iielzdfe03ldxew52fqwuxu.jpg?w=432&amp;s=0d9f065de9eb3ee46c2043e1b01cefba ) sorta thing ), 
  he 's lecturing her like he owns her , and she looks the part of a scolded child ; that 's literally the way a stern father looks like when disciplining his daughter , and the eyeroll makes her look like a child who is annoyed that she got caught sneaking in the cookie jar . 
  what a pathetically weak leader germany has . 
   lol , they sidelined trump and he is visibly fuming ... where i come from in ballygobackwards , we call that * `` projecting '' *, 
  nothing serious , just tried to force irish banks to foreclose homes during the financial crisis and [ tried to force abortion on a population which strongly opposes it ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/7/irish-abortion-group-returns-soros-money-but-big-q/ ) , just little things like that, 
   why tho hate ? 
  he 's instrumental in regime change of non-compliant nations on a level that makes even the yanks/brits blush ... his hand seems to be wherever there is some sort of ` democracy movement ' where thugs are armed with weapons and balaclavas to overthrow their legitimate governments ... 
  disgusting so-called ` hate speech ' laws are the antithesis of freedom and democracy, 
  they 're hungarian , i imagine their reasons for hating this devil are far greater than my own , and i have pretty good reasons . 
  why ? 
  what are you trying to insinuate ? 
  you * know * you 're a fucking evil rodent when even your own country finances campaigns against you, 
  i want to be the counterweight to the disgusting circlejerk all over * mutti *, 
  netherlands yes , belgium no . 
  hell , i 'll even say sweden is a pretty free , open society , except the citizenry do n't know how to handle it so they just have tonnes of foreigners use it against them on their own home turf, 
   i think it 's really cool that europeans are rational enough to actively shit on the continent 's scumbags this is not validated until we get to merkel ( though it was getting heavily upvoted , mods removed it )  we ca n't have people thinking r/europe is n't a right wing cesspool now , can we ? 
  / s better that than some antifa circlejerk of worthless anarchist detritus, 
  itt : we pretend that merkel actually has contributed anything good to humanity, 
  this woman is literally the worst thing to happen to europe in a century : wwii destroyed europe for a generation , her refugee policy will destroy europe for good, 
  precisely . 
  wwii destroyed europe for a generation ; merkel 's eu will destroy europe for good, 
  someone 's power-modding the hell out of this thread [ not like it is n't obvious who , of course ] -- all the anti-merkel comments are being removed, 
   the refugees will integrate soon enough . 
  ireland is a tiny country , i do n't want hundreds of thousands to * integrate * , i want them to beat it back where they came from, 
   this whole crisis is ridiculously blown out of proportion  merkel supporter wewlad, 
   well there 's your problem - donnie 's making it so that his job is losing its importance . 
  not really , that 's more your own bias , the press over here is finally admitting to what a beating he 's giving them all -- slate and the atlantic has more-or-less admitted they have been beaten, 
   imagine being the leader of the free world ... ... where you get thrown into prison for writing an opinion online ? 
  please . 
  america will always be the land of the free , then ireland  power hungry assholes  merkel, 
   there were no bad photos of obama or clinton in the media . 
  i 've seen bad photos of clinton -- she practically set herself up for those -- but europeans lived with the notion that * any * criticism of obama 's character or person was racist , so that simply did n't happen, 
  this whole thread is a dumpster fire intended on making merkel look far better than she is , of course i 'm going to shit on her, 
   why would i want a strong leader that turns the country to shit ? 
  instead , you have a weak leader to turn your country to shit, 
  lol , you think power is a popularity contest ? 
  burning your own city to the ground because you 're impotent with rage over something you read on huffpo or the grauniad is n't exactly the best way to `` protest '' ... whatever it is they 're protesting anyway ( doubt they even have a clue ), 
  please , anyone looks strong standing next to merkel, 
  no , she just does n't give a shit to arrest anyone and so it goes to shit -- nero and a lyre and all that, 
  last i looked , she was the leader of germany, 
  you just do n't like the titles , obvious german protecting his mutti is obvious, 
  * `` the morning commute in hamburg/hamburg altona heute morgen [ thanks merkel ! / danke mutti !, 
   what happened here ? 
  why there is no police or firefighters ? 
  it 's germany , that 'd be bigoted/racist/islamophobic / anti-gay , duh, 
   she 's trying to seduce them [ mfw ] ( http://replygif.net/thumbnail/651.gif ) , especially when you consider all of their wives are at least 20x more attractive it 's like trying to tempt someone used to drinking chardonnay their whole life to try a glass of buckfast tonic wine ; that , and trump and erdo\u011fan appear to be talking * at * her , and putin is a known charmer , not one to be charmed, 
  downvoted just for europol, 
  do n't blame me , my title was better , but obvious german mod removed it for `` not exact title '', 
  no , i just hate modern germany and everything they stand for, 
  i used the exact title , should n't be removed now, 
  it does n't have a title ... its a video . 
  now you 're just censoring shite , and its obvious as day, 
  the scheisskopf mutt of the free world, 
   one of the most popular leaders in germany ever i think you forget the most popular german leader ever ... tell me , was he a swell lad ? 
  will you be removing all the others as well , or just mine ? 
   `` due to his belief in laissez faire economics hm , looks like you mispelled `` hatred of the irish '' , but do n't let a moment pass up to bash free markets in the name of your socialist agenda,
