  [ they did n't call it ` euromaidan ' because the name was catchy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpp2lbytxjc ), 
  apples and oranges . 
  you can say anything you want so long as it is n't libelous and it is n't directly threatening or putting anyone 's lives in immediate danger ( for which there is a legal definition of what this constitutes , most famously the `` fire in a theatre '' test ) . 
  you can be a paedophile nazi who advocates genocide against anyone with red hair , and yet you will be allowed to say your piece in the united states . 
  interestingly enough , this system has operated almost completely without incident , despite the rest of europeans always clamouring for more control on speech -- america is a racial tinderbox waiting to explode , and yet free speech only seems to alleviate the issue , instead of sweeping it under the rug as is the european fashion . 
  so yes , in the sense that you can say literally anything short of a violent threat or a libelous statement that can be disproven in court , there is absolute freedom of speech in the us . 
   this one where polish politican and latvian journalist put russians in place and made them explode into madness was quite epic . 
  they got triggered faster than a feminist in trump rally judging from your tone , it just sounds like you hate russians to me -- let it out , whooosaaaa, 
   these articles rarely are latvian articles . 
  usually they 're west european . 
  should give you a moment to pause and think that latvians who share a border have less concern about this issue than the belgian troll-press, 
   if russians were to treat their history like germans only a suicidal , servile and castrated nation would want the fate of germany , seeing that 's exactly how churchill et . 
  laid out the groundwork, 
   once they buy into that , they tend to write off the human rights violations , endemic corruption , lack of journalistic freedom , lack of genuine political opposition etc ... just like the eu does with turkey , saudi arabia , cuba , or any other regime it is we feel like can benefit us . 
  pot , meet kettle ? 
   edit : when world leaders start answering interview questions with soviet deflection tactics you see just how good the kremlin is at what they do i do n't get it , any instance of the russians pointing out western hypocrisy is automatically a logical fallacy because ... ? 
  i mean , i thought the whole point of naming hypocrisy was to show that the tone for the debate was set by the others , not yourself, 
  hungary 's most famous , hated bastard son , spreading evil and neoliberal regime change around the globe . 
  too all those talking about * `` all the good he does '' * , this bastard funds secession movements and societies meant on destroying the social fabric of nations . 
  he has his own private cell awaiting him in hades . 
  because there 's no smoking gun or real evidence beyond anecdotal reports and youtube clips ? 
   to me it is not . 
  you 're either for free speech and the freedom of one 's own conscience , or you 're against it . 
  there is no middle ground in this debate . 
   please . 
  no , not ` please ' . 
  the british empire did * far * worse than anything the nazis ever did , and they were accoladed for their empire enough that to this day , the period 1800-1945 is associated with romantic tales of adventure , sherlock holmes and prude fashion rather than say , the genocide of bengal ( uncountable millions , possibly more than died in the entire holocaust through purposeful famine ) , depopulating ireland by 25 % ( at least a million and a half , some say as much as 2 million ) , the cultural decimation of west africa , and putting various populations from the afrikaners to the kikuyu into concentration camps until they died in the hundreds of thousands . 
  ** edit : ** as an irishman , i would have much rather have the nazis than the british, 
  sounds like an appropriate day enough, 
   `` anyone who does n't agree with my narrow , russophobic point of view clouded by my own ethno-nationalist politics is a moron '' you could 've just said that to remind me that i should n't dignify you with a response . 
  lol , how the hell did you come up with that ? 
  good craic, 
   we have no free speech in germany . 
  and we will never have . 
  and in may opinion it 's fine , as long as you 're not hurting the basic idea of free speech . 
  this paragraph is a mindfuck of contradictory statements  i think you need your own g\u00f6bbels and hitler first worse , we had robert peel , john major , queen victoria and winston churchill  the right to say everything , can be damaging to your society and the brains of your citizens . 
  only if they 're stupid -- america 's and her colonial predecessors have had free speech for over 300 years and the only internal conflict they had was over the economic status of slavery , they 've never had any war or internal strife over the ability to speak freely , and the racial issues there are far more delicate than they ever were in germany, 
  * '' portugal would be a transcontinental country except for the fact these plates are not defined as continents . 
   so , in fact , it 's nothing like that . 
  yes , in that the cameras are turned away . 
   neither would i call `` hate festivals '' . 
  watch more american corporate news then , or shows like ` bill maher ', 
  i 'm pretty sure france has possessions in africa , north america , and south america ( not to mention polynesia , which is n't a continent , but still ) , yet what the hell do i know ( though i guess as that 's four , that still technically makes portugal the world 's only three-continent country , though it 's disputable whether or not the netherlands could make the same claim ), 
  call me a shill without evidence , get called a cunt with a smoking gun to boot . 
  the fact that the law does n't address the denial of the armenian genocide , khmer genocide , etc , yet seems fixiated on the german holocaust is a little imbalanced in application -- i get that one happened in one place over another , but the law is the law , it is n't designed to be flouted or passed for its symbolic value -- if they wanted to make yet another law to target speech pertaining to the events of the 1930s-40s , they should have just done that, 
  you live in estonia . 
  what the fuck do you know about russia beyond your own borders , where russians are more-or-less second class citizens with a generational racial hatred against them ? 
  hell , i see your flag and i immediately discount your opinion , i do n't even know why i bother, 
  then leave , then we 'll have one less troll, 
   when was the last time someone beat up a guest in bbc show ? 
  you must have missed the fiasco surrounding nick griffin attending question time , or the number of times nigel farage has been assaulted at a press conference -- the difference is , the bbc and other british public institutions are usually keen enough to only let it occur * outside * their properties , not in them . 
  that , and the irony that the british government just entered a coalition with a literal religious fundamentalist party that believes in racial supremacy over irish people . 
   if you rewrite stuff in a way abstract enough everything is the same , but no , all countries do n't do the same . 
  the hate festivals like in russian tv does n't happen in the west . 
  `` hate festivals '' ? 
  you must not watch a lot of western tv , do you ? 
  i mean , is n't this common practice ? 
  almost all countries do this . 
  the bbc has been embroiled in controversy again and again by stacking question time audiences with activists favourable to one particular party over another , and in the us , you had people ejected from `` townhall '' meetings for veering from the script of the pre-screened questions that were leaked to the favoured candidate in advance . 
  this seems relatively mild in comparison to those incidents . 
   the armenian genocide is n't connected to this law in any way . 
  thanks for proving my point, 
   let 's argue about direct vs indirect involvement whatever that is . 
  well every country is sinking her tentacles into the ukrainian issues , and in fact , the eu is entirely responsible for starting it due to their direct involvement in overthrowing the democratically-elected government , so there, 
   given for one the evidence is servicemen and weapons captured because that totally ca n't be staged , especially when russia and ukraine have pretty much identical weaponry, 
   what anglo-saxon economists always fail to realize , the euro is an incredible ... ... failure that does n't allow poorer countries to create their own inflation policies and interest rates , meaning that they lose out to those who benefit from the euro 's export-oriented flotation , i.e , germany and france , and that things are far more expensive than need be for many of these countries forced to do business in the euro , especially those like romania and greece . 
  there is a reason that a number of smaller eu nations are mulling a return to their former currencies , and it is n't because of how wild a success the euro was . 
  inb4 putin is responsible sans evidence, 
  managed clapping is * de jure * in the uk , especially question time , where the producers will literally stack the audiences with ideologues representing their favourite political ideology ( usually some form of globalism ), 
  anything ` the guardian ' publishes on russia is immediately toxic and rubbished as far as i am concerned -- they 've been gunning out for them literally since before putin even took office, 
  well i mean , it was only last year that germany decided to recognise the armenian genocide and make denial legal ( after 70 years of refusing to recognise it ) , and even that was just [ shrewd political opportunism ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/05/the-difference-between-germany-and-turkey-is-admitting-to-genocide-erdogan-merkel/ ) , so pardon me if i 'm not convinced that germans are just * really * concerned with what 's good for society, 
  another victory for the authoritarian enemies of free speech and freedom of conscience , and their draconian agenda to control political discourse and strangle it to death in her crib . 
  it 'd be one thing if the law were evenly applied -- it is n't, 
   i do n't see any reconciliation happen ** until they admit their hideous crimes . 
  ** sounds like you 've already reached a verdict before a trial could even be composed . 
  people like you are definitely the problem , not the solution, 
   the only real question here is wether [ sic ] putin believes his own bullshit . 
  you believe the bullshit of the eu every day , that expansion into ukraine was ` about democracy ' and ` the people 's will ' l despite having von rompuy on the ground violating ukraine 's long-held policy of neutrality to make a promise he could n't keep ( ukrainian ascension into the eu ) in order to rile up ethnic/religious conflict so as to have ukrainians overthrow their own democratically elected leaders . 
  i 'll take the half-truth offered by putin , over the lies of the eu * any * day . 
   they come up with new version and new shocking evidence ( and forged documents ) every month . 
  i think people , even in ~ ~ russia ~ ~ the eu , have stopped paying attention to all these conspiracy theories , that are so eagerly supported by ~ ~ kremlin ~ ~ european state media . 
  wow , it 's almost like you can say the exact same about russian conspiracies involving the united states and french elections , or direct involvement in the ukraine !, 
  ... so in otherwords , america had legal homosexual marriage before germany ? 
  why is germany always thumbing her nose at america ( and to that extent , britain ) then ? 
  ** edit : downvoted out of pure spite **, 
  brilliant , a reddit ama as a primary source , hand me a copy of the daily mail while you 're at it, 
   saudi arabia did not start the war in yemen . 
  islamists in the north of yemen , known as the houthis , finally suceeded after decades of trying to take over the country . 
  iran supported the houthis , saudi arabia supports the ousted government . 
  iran is n't in yemen , yet saudi is . 
  it sounds like they started a war . 
  just this once , iran 's situation is unique since you will not hear about it anywhere else, 
   they spread and fund islamic terror in gaza , lebanon , afganistan , and much more . 
  you realise that those aforementioned nations and iran do n't even share a common religious strain , do you ? 
  why would iran be funding wahhabist terror , when wahhabists want to kill them ? 
  how ? 
  they do n't start wars , women have full rights equivalent with men ( people often think about the enforcement of the chador they wear the loose headscarf , yet men are n't allowed to dress immodestly in public -- it 's just their law ) , and they are a very intelligent , culturally rich people with a history dating back thousands of years . 
  saudis on the other hand were literally just slave traders that mi6 installed into power . 
   iranian government gave refuge to al qaeda after 9/11 and the afghanistan invasion . 
  al qaeda is a wahhabist organisation that sees iranians ( of whom among the muslim population , 99 % are shiites ) as infidels committing * bid ` ah * , or `` religious innovation '' , and want to basically send them all to hell .
