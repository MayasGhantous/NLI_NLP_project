no , if you could wrap your mind around looking at a globe you would see that belgium is not situated at the mediterranean . 
  therefore it does n't have the same problems italy , malta or greece have . 
  i 'm not sure why you need that to be pointed out ... 
  exactly , once your country is as unindated as the likes of greece , france and italy you will learn . 
   because you wo n't come over here without an ar-15 anyway trying to suggest i 'm some radical murdering neo-nazi to discredit an oppinion you do n't agree with ? 
  good argument . 
   people calling me brown haired means nothing to me neither , but sometimes the obvious gets stated . 
  ah yes the `` your a racist '' trying to discredit my opinion further with a smear campaign used to this leftist tactic by now tbh but it just demonstrates your lack of intelligence and your reluctance for a real discussion on the topic where `` feels before reals '' is n't a part of it . 
  can i ask why instead of helping refugees etc you do n't help your own country men first ? 
  like the homeless , the drug addicts and alcoholics ? 
  i am by no means a violent person , i do n't hate these people , i dont want to harm or kill them i just do n't want them in my country because they do n't belong here imo just like christian preechers do n't belong in saudi arabia ( they 'd be arrested if not worse ) i do n't hate or dislike you either , nor those like you . 
  i realise you 're trying to do what you think is right , i just think your poor misguided and brainwashed idiots . 
  only when they are marching in your streets to end democracy or telling your country to go to hell or beheading your people in the streets will you realise what a mistake you 've made . 
  i reported him . 
  top kek 7 year account too , 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  how did u get that from his comment ? 
  the idiots on this sub i swear , christian immigrants will integrate better and wo n't form ghettos like in france and sweden is that so hard to understand ? 
  if you want muslim immigrants so badly invite them into your home and provide them with a place to stay . 
  or do you only support accepting them when someone else has to foot the bill and deal with them ? 
   well , now i 'm torn . 
  on the one hand this is the jingoistic attitude i despise . 
  not at all , in a foreign country you might stumble into a rough area or not know to avoid the `` chavs '' of that country or how they look . 
  nothing about jingoism at all at all . 
  well i got sick of his shitty attitude , i do n't have the patience of a saint . 
   unless you plan to visit gypsy slum and/or visit prostitutes while completely drunk you have little to fear . 
  haha ok then i guess i 'm just nervous about going abroad alone for the first time . 
  thanks !, 
  you know you 're right when you have to do everything you can , no matter how trivial to hurt those `` against '' you lol . 
  let me guess he downvotes everything you post in reply to his comments ? 
  lol . 
  he 's doing it to me and / u/arathian as well . 
  lol he did it to mine too . 
  looks like he 's discussing with 3 people at once and downvotes them the second they post , kinda sad really thank god karma is meaning less, 
  a lot of them behave that way , it 's not a generalisation . 
  you know , i 've often found that it 's people who have the least amount of exposure to these migrants who defend them most vigorously . 
  tell me , is belgium recieving 750,000 of them by the end of the year like germany ? 
  or are there 20,000 of them in one small part of belgium like there are on greek islands ? 
  also , ca n't they just rent hotel [ rooms ? 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/04/us-belgium-asylum-iduskcn0q91lm20150804 ) ________________________________________________ and all of this aside , would you be willing to put up some of these migrants in your home ? 
  and who do you expect to pay for all their food , treatment ? 
  etc and one more question if you would n't mind , do you have a job ? 
   you 're generalizing . 
  in regards to what exactly , the behavior of the migrants or calling the laws outdated ? 
   you seem to misunderstand what laws are . 
  kek . 
   a country that discriminates on the basis of religion should not call itself a democracy . 
  says who ? 
  you ? 
  not really the case , look at the riots in italy and greece , look at the strain they are putting on france and germany . 
  they are causing trouble in the uk and they have n't even arrived yet . 
  slovakia is simply protecting themselves which is a logical move so you can whine about laws all you like but they are placing integration and a happy safe society over laws that would do nothing but cause their own people and the migrants themselves harm . 
  what a great country that they place peoples welfare in front of outdated laws . 
  ** edit : ** posted just this second and you already have it downvoted 10/10 would debate with 5 year old again . 
  but exceptions !, 
  international law is only followed when people want to follow it . 
  are you really downvoting all my comments because you disagree ? 
  like you said , there can be exceptions because there is such a large volume of immigrants . 
  ** edit : ** you really downvoted every comment i made ? 
  damn what is your problem ? 
  no wonder you 've gotten the shit kicked out of you so many times . 
  i see , well if exceptions can be made then i suppose exceptions should be made for slovakians too . 
  you ca n't really blame them for wanting migrants who will integrate better than others especially in eastern europe which in my experience are generally more anti-islam than western europeans . 
  ( but thats purely anecdotal on my part ), 
   you sound like a naive fool , carrying a weapon while travelling around europe is an incredibly stupid idea . 
  only if you do n't know how to use it , damn are you hostile . 
  people are saying that those laws do n't count since slovakia is n't the first `` safe country '' they arrived in, 
  i do n't carry weapons in ireland , carrying a weapon does not make you a psychopath . 
  i 'm glad you 've never had an experience which made you want to carry weapons but others have , try to be more considerate and less abrasive . 
  whats the big deal ? 
  if they 're not breaking any treaties or what ever that they signed then it 's their country and they have the right to decide who can enter and who can not . 
   when the people arrive at the beach , they are here . 
  do n't allow them get to the beach in the first place , patrol european waters ( as is the coast guards job ) and return migrants to their point of origin . 
  these people whether desperate or not , are criminals and are undocumented , word has spread of an easy life in europe and so more are coming . 
  have you ever seen the gum ball demonstration on [ youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpjzfgchgle ) ? 
  no amount of immigration can make a dent in the worlds poor . 
  illegal immigrants solves nothing . 
  we need to refuse these people entry and destroy the illegal rafts before they leave in the first place ( while empty of course ), 
   which ones ? 
  calling your own culture is not nationalism  you seem to think that caring about the destruction of a national identity is not nationalistic . 
  what ? 
  caring about the loss/destruction of your culture and nation is nationalism i never said the opposite . 
   what if it was dying ? 
  as long as i am alive and celebrate it , it will not die unless useless self hating irish hipsters adopt american culture . 
   do n't worry i think you 'll get what you want not so far into the future . 
  as in people like you realising how wrong you are not to care about your own culture ? 
  hopefully . 
  self hate seems to be popular in europe these days , but at least i can say not with me . 
  i love ireland , i love being irish and i love our history and culture . 
  no more replies have a good one mate . 
   i 'm saying it 's a trivial one . 
  ________________________  i can certainly say that immigrants from outside europe seem to have their own unique cultures and customs which seem very exotic to someone like me . 
  ________________________  western europeans ? 
  they talk with an accent and that 's about it . 
  ________________________  this is why i made a new account before i even dared to argue from a conservative viewpoint ) conservative ? 
  that 's not conservative . 
  i am so angry and so disgusted with your views that i do n't really know to say other than i am so happy to be a nationalist and i love my culture and the wonderful diverse cultures of europe , i hope we never lose them and i hope people like you cease to exist ( i do n't mean die or anything ) by means of learning that england and europe do in fact have wonderful and exotic cultures . 
  ah ok , cool thanks . 
   as an arab christian probably the only refugees we should really be accpeting , you 're different but christian so that at least co incides somewhat with most european countrys . 
  the fact that you are hated in the middle east and being slaughtered on a large scale should make you an automatic yes for asylum/refugee status .
