  yeah it 's madness really , is / r/europe a default sub ? 
  or do you have to actively seek it out and subscribe ? 
  would you say the same thing for say the french ? 
  or italians ? 
  what about nigerians and iraqi 's ? 
  or is it only the english who you say has no culture ? 
  btw i 'm not being snide or anything simply trying to understand a viewpoint that i ca n't ever see myself having . 
  ** you have been banned from / r/european **, 
   fear destitution so they are economic immigrants then ? 
  whats so funny about that ? 
   bbc center left , definitely some bias reuters probably the best . 
  have you seen czech women ? 
  of course they 're not looking forward to having sex with foreign women hahaha, 
  if european governments would handle illegal immigration and the rise of radical islam properly there would be no need for the right . 
  `` do n't say anything and hope they do n't know we exist / it 's too cold for them and let the uk , germany , italy and greece have them '' - ireland, 
  hungary plans to imprison illegal immigrants . 
  it 's sad that a country enforcing border control constitutes news these days . 
  maybe it 's because they feel dis associated with their home country ? 
  perhaps celebrating english culture and history in schools might give them a more happier outlook ? 
  similar to `` black history month '' for black people in the usa, 
  i suggest you and other like you sub to / r/european and stay there for a week . 
  you 'll see that it 's just the vocal minority that comment mostly . 
  just like feminism has their `` free bleeders '' / r / european has our racists . 
  meh when you get called a racist and a nazi on every comment critical of mass illegal immgration , radical islam or people assuming / r/european is the next coontown you lose patience . 
  but you 're right i 'll try in the future . 
  ah my bad . 
  you deleted your comment ? 
  you must truly believe in what you say . 
  not true what so ever most people do n't vote on things at all . 
  look at all the subs / r/funny has , do you see comments with 1 million upvotes ? 
  no , you can cherry pick all the things you do n't like from that sub as you wish but i 'll never agree that is it a `` racist sub '', 
  yes i 'm a racist and anything else you want to call me , now please stop replying this is the last time i 'm going to reply to you . 
  edit : oh look , you deleted your comment . 
  real brave . 
  yeah it 's the same in ireland . 
  latvians , lithuanians , belorussians poles and russians integrate perfectly with us . 
  other nationalities not so much . 
  guinness and a beef stew . 
   all these foreigners are trying to get in on the banter i 'm irish let me in on the banter lads, 
   shock infantryman whats the difference between infantry and shock infantry ? 
   it is not ok to suggest that members of different cultures or races are incapable of cohabiting . 
  i am from a culture called zynoraxism we believe that only people who follow our sect deserve to live and all others must be `` removed '' are you sure it 's not ok to suggest different cultures are incapable of cohabiting because that goes against my religion/culture and i 'll have to report you to the admins . 
   it is not ok to suggest that some races or cultures are inherently better than others . 
  in my culture , women have sex with relatives at the age of 18 for 7 days to coincide with the days of the week and the blood moon prophecy of walakin-do eye-rubani the blood god of the planet zx-21 ( andromeda galaxy ) at the age of 20 we twist cut and break off boys fingers to accept them into man hood and when a person reaches 70 they are tied to a bed and set on fire . 
  ( all of this has been agreed to upon accepting zynoraxism ) we believe that by it 's sole existance our culture is inferior to every other culture . 
  are you going to tell me that say , american modern culture is possibly worse than mine ? 
  if so i think the admins will need to see this . 
  huh , i never though america would ever listen to a country when being told what it can or can not do . 
   you won the internet argument !, 
  i know , now shush because i 'm done . 
  you had to run and hide to your little commie sub reddit lol . 
  i won , sorry but your a joke and i 'm not wasting my time on you . 
  [ mfw ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/tee-hee.gif ) i btfo someone so [ hard ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/fullcommunism/comments/3f1dhs/mfw_reactionaries_drop_their_facade_and_start/ ) they think i 'm legit and have to post about it . 
  mfw a `` communist '' drops their facade and buys expensive games and gaming computers . 
  [ mfw ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/giggle.gif ) a `` communist '' who hates the right for being ignorant and violent is ignorant and violent . 
  [ mfw ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/pat1.gif ) a `` communist '' who supports the `` worker '' follows an ideology that is infamous for mass murdering poor peasants . 
  [ mfw ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/giggle.gif ) a `` communist '' who says you do n't talk to facists you kill them keeps replying to someone he thinks is a fascist because he is so butthurt after getting btfo . 
   being a communist that loves to buy expensive stuff  hates facism for it 's mass murders , `` violence '' and `` racism ''  supports an ideology guilty of multiple mass murders , more murders than full blown national socialism in fact . 
   wants to murder people on the right  thinking gulags are funny, 
   one more thing , it 's nice to see that this comment chain started out with you asking why / r/european is perceived as racist , and ended with you posting nazi propaganda . 
  it 's nice to see that it 's as easy to annoy a commie as posting german propaganda haha . 
  i love how you think the communists are any different to nazi 's or facism . 
  polish officers murdered en mass by dirty [ communist fucks ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/katyn_massacre_1.jpg ) for the glory of the worker and [ communism !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_killings_under_communist_regimes )  mass killings occurred under some communist regimes during the twentieth century with an estimated death toll numbering between 85 and 100 million i 'll bet you a new gaming pc and ipad and some games that 99 % were poor workers . 
  soviet [ gulag ] ( http://gulaghistory.org/nps/onlineexhibit/stalin/work-src/images/belbaltlag_detail.jpg ) workers of the world unite !,

  [ lol . 
  they have more than 1,200 members but what i 'm saying is after their official launch they were getting around 300 sign ups every 12 hours . 
  which for a brand new party is good . 
  denying the right is on the rise and pretending they have no chance or not taking them seriously is n't going to stop them . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs9oo0s5w2k edit : accidentally removed the k at the end, 
   they wo n't get votes as their leader sounds like a f ** king idiot . 
  that 's what about 40 % of the comments on their page say yet the day after they launched they had 300 + sign ups in about 12 hours . 
   rather than try to prove me wrong i 've done so , numerous times , i 've also shown you to be a hypocrite a liar and a coward . 
   you went on a creepy post crawl/psychoanalysis . 
  i 'm out , you 've already proved my point . 
  when you do it it 's a nonchalant `` quick check '' but when i do it , it 's a creepy crawl through your history ? 
  so persecuted , so brave . 
  about 3 minutes or so , not a fan of being called up on your bullshit i see ? 
   call the right violent racist and unreasonable  call for the murder of the right  be a commie  buy a gaming pc  buy games  talk about how capitalism is bad, 
  and i 'm glad your a pretend communist internet tough guy who buys gaming pc 's why not donate the money to help your fellow workers eh ? 
  why arent you out working on the streets helping the homeless since you care about the workers and hate the rich so much you commie prick . 
   fuck me this place needs a purge , anyone that orders a # 26 bottle of water just booked themselves a place up against the wall . 
  you sound even more [ reasonable ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/3efuo6/the_merchant_hotel_launches_new_luxury_water_menu/cteju4a ) because [ it 's all lies ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/3cs886/50000_comrades_ready_for_the_revolution/csyvdwa ) , it 's all a front and you are exactly what you are complaining about . 
  `` i support class war , i 'm a [ communist ] ( https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1397/12/1397129650457.png ) i 'm such a tough guy , come at me capitalist righty shitlord i 'm ready to defend the workers ! '', 
  since you 're a violent communist , i do n't know why i expected an intelligent argument . 
  well then we disagree at the most basic level . 
  yeah i mean at least the filter gives people the choice , is it that the mods lazy or inept that they do n't implement it ? 
  / r/worldnews has no people complaining about topics coming up too much because they have the filter . 
  seems like the quick and easy fix . 
   but do you really need more than one thread a day to do it ? 
  i think we should have as many un-censored threads as people want , mods are trying to steer the direction and topics of threads and thats not what their job is . 
  their job is to make sure people follow the rules and tbh i think they are just childish man-kids on a power trip . 
   i think we all agree on that , we just do n't agree with what to do in the meantime exactly so lets talk about it !, 
  i honestly do n't think we would have the same bizarre , terrible situation of mods sticking their claws into places they do n't belong if it was a less political or sensitive topic . 
  i think it 's really only immigration that they would do this for because this sub is mostly left of the political spectrum and as someone on the right i feel like banning people with similar views to mine is just ostracizing a large portion of european visitors . 
  i mean , the sub is called `` european '' not `` left/liberal european '' i agree with 99 % of what you are saying and i understand the point , its just my gripe is with the meddling behavior of the mods . 
  that is usually the way it goes but it should n't stop us discussing it and trying to come up with something else . 
  like , perhaps instead of bombing the shit out of their countrys to get rid of brutal dictators who are essentially holding the country together , why not push and fund social change and make sure the money actually gets to where it needs to go and works .
