... the detailed laying down of technical specifications to meet the essential requirements of the directives is left to the ** standrads ** body . 
  does n't exactly inspire confidence ... 
  aw ... damn !, 
  ` burkinis ' have essentially been around a long time as [ what orthodox jewish women already wear to the beach ] ( http://forward.com/sisterhood/348382/seriously-what-orthodox-women-wear-to-the-beach-is-no-different-from-a-burk/ ) , but you never hear anyone complaining about that , because no one wants to be called anti-semitic . 
  sorry about the downvotes . 
  it 's just a term and it 's clear you did n't mean anything by it . 
  honestly , ( as with pretty much everything else ) it 's hard to say yet what effect ` brexit ' is going to have here . 
  yes there will definitely be some upsides like multinational companies looking for a developed , english-speaking country to set up their european headquarters will have yet another reason to choose dublin . 
  * however * , a good percentage of our exports , especially agricultural goods , go to the uk , so things are certainly going to get ` interesting ' soon . 
  they just had to screw it up for everyone . 
   killkenny ( one too many ` l 's by the way , we do n't actually kill kenny . ), 
  yay , my city !, 
  ( if you can call 25,000 a ` city ' ) yeah , it 's funny how much you take it for granted when you grow up here . 
  for example i think there are only two round towers in the whole country that you can actually still climb up , and not only do we have one of them , but you get a pretty good view of the city from it . 
  your username looks like a long depressed emotionless face . 
   emu war [ never forget ] ( / r/emuwarflashbacks ), 
  [ euro ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yngcwk7.jpg ) 's got you covered !, 
  and [ fennoscandia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsxme8h6iyc ) for sweden , norway and finland . 
   but we really had no chance against them ... makes sense . 
  hard to beat [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3wiydd/til_that_it_liechtensteins_last_military/ ) anyway . 
  also worth noting that they 're still down from their peak of 24 seats in 2010 . 
   is as a whole more than less do you mean `` more or less '' ? 
  you seem to know what you 're talking about , so , now that they 've lost the 30 seat minimum for the petition of concern , is there any reason not to expect legalised abortion and gay marriage within the next year or two ? 
  fair enough . 
  upvoted , though you might want to mention that in your own response . 
  he did n't say they were racist . 
  that was you . 
  tell me , do you think ` nationalistic/anti-immigration ' is an unfair characterisation of ` leave ' sentiment ? 
  because i thought `` taking back power from brussels '' and `` being able to control our own borders '' were essentially the two biggest points of the campaign ? 
  sometimes the middle ground * is * the best solution though . 
  the fallacy is saying that [ it * must * be ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argument_to_moderation ) , but perhaps in this case it just is . 
  i do n't think i 'm reading too much into this , but i imagine that there 's an implied `` i believe that ... '' in the original comment that might ease your concerns . 
  funnily enough , [ you 're the only one who committed a fallacy here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argument_from_fallacy ) . 
  it would only be a fallacy if they were saying that this answer lies somewhere in the middle because * all * answers lie in the middle . 
  that 's not the impression i got . 
  i think that they 're just saying that * in this case * they believe it does lie in the middle ? 
  pretty soon we 're going to need a megathread to keep track of all these megathreads . 
  what ? 
  more people --  more demand for goods and services --  more jobs supplying goods and services otherwise how could any growing country with a high population work ? 
  our employment would likely still be just as bad , but the actual * rate * would n't be any worse just because we would have more people . 
  kinda off topic , but it reminds me of something i heard from [ tomi reichantal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomi_reichental ) , one of only three holocaust survivors living in ireland . 
  he said that at the time , the people of his homeland , czechoslovakia , largely supported deporting jews to german concentration camps , so much so that they actually paid money to have the jews taken off their hands . 
  why was this ? 
  because many saw the jews as competition . 
  they figured that once the jewish tailor was out of the way , it would mean more business for the native czechoslovak one . 
  same goes for other professions . 
  however what they did n't seem to realise was that jews not only sold goods and services , but bought them too , just like everyone else . 
  they had spent so much money on forcibly removing tens of thousands of people from their own country , and for what ? 
  it did n't actually improve anything for the native tailor . 
  it would be funny if it were n't so sad . 
  never !, 
  * * ( as long as there 's no more global recessions ), 
  it seems like arbitrarily comparing people you dislike to trump has become the new comparing them to hitler . 
  hey !, 
  speaking of well spotted , i just noticed your username . 
  may i just say `` damn you ! '' ? 
  i had to read you out last week . 
  if anybody else is wondering about that pin just hanging out in the ocean off the coast of africa , let me introduce you to [ null island ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjvipi-1w84 ) !, 
  yeah , i guess that 's what all the fuss is about . 
  for example , i 'm pretty sure that greenland and the faroe islands are part of denmark , and denmark is part of the eu , but greenland and the islands are n't technically in the eu . 
  similarly , uk citizens are ( currently ) eu citizens , and isle of man citizens are uk citizens , but if an isle of man citizen want 's to live in the eu , then they first have to spend 5 or so years in between on mainland uk . 
  it 's kind of crazy .

  would you prefer they left the efta/eea/whatever all over a 0.66 % margin ? 
  wow that was pretty close too . 
  would most people have known what `` the federal popular initiative against * mass immigration * was ? 
  otherwise if it came across as more like `` mass immigration ; yes/no ? '', 
  i can see how that could have favoured no . 
  it means whatever she needs it to mean at that moment . 
  do those same politicians advocate full membership in the eu ? 
  or is it just complaining for the sake of complaining ? 
  eh , not exactly . 
  [ it 's complicated to say the least . 
  credit to them for not losing track of it . 
  hey , you chose to be isolated . 
  appropriate , i guess , 
  i 'm just wondering what [ that one heart ] ( https://i.redd.it/v8xkguo4f7py.png ) was in the middle of / r/placehearts which was apparently so contentious . 
  someone had to do it . 
  besides , [ those pixels were just resting in our account . 
  ] ( http://craic-it.com/wp-content/uploads/father-ted-e1435659696111.jpg ), 
  beaten at their own game . 
  so like he said , nothing . 
  looking at [ this ] ( https://g.redditmedia.com/umehyevaao3e5pu25ykrxwlv17zctcygo_vcszliu44.gif?fm=mp4&amp;mp4-fragmented=false&amp;s=fb9f465c674381ec7b4d7c2f932b02eb ) , it 's not exactly clear that france would have won . 
  sure there was a big initial push , but that could just have been undone by germany again if the eu had n't stepped in . 
  besides , you * did * get your flag back , just not necessarily in the same exact place . 
  `` we 're not retreating , we 're advancing in reverse . '', 
  -- derek landy , skullduggery pleasant, 
  you were kicked out by germany , not the eu , unless i 'm mistaken ? 
  the eu flag was the compromise . 
  actually that was two years ago . 
  i know , it 's hard to believe . 
  apparently i completely missed what they did last year . 
   last year was r/robin , [ not exactly ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/robin/comments/4cx152/this_is_not_where_to_go_to_discuss_whatever_weird/ ), 
  wait , would n't that mean they used to be the same as poland ? 
  sorry , i meant irish speakers who do n't also speak english , if that was n't clear . 
  yeah , i guess i should n't have simply said `` native speakers '' . 
  also , secondary schools too ? 
  i was under the impression that primary schools are common enough , but not so much secondaries . 
  i got into an argument before with someone else on reddit about how much wasted effort is put into irish such as having duplicates of government documents and road signs in irish and they insisted that there are actually some native speakers left on the islands off the west coast such as the arans , at least until they grow up and go to school on the mainland , so since then i 've just stuck to `` negligible '' or `` practically zero '' .
