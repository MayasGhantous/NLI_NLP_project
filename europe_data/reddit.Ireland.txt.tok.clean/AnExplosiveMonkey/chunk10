  oooohhhhhh ... thanks !, 
  how does that explain it ? 
  over half a year beforehand ? 
  do you have any examples of that ? 
  which is why many people choose not to stop and think . 
  he 's like `` really ? '', 
  has that really tiny sliver of a country , looking for independence , transnistria . 
  swordfight !, 
  it better be worth it . 
  so because they get used to the artificial grass at such a young age , it means they 're actually a little worse when it comes to playing on real grass ? 
  well if you insist . 
  why 's that ? 
  [ that is just like churches , trying to trick people into going to hell !,

  do you think that will happen under may ? 
  source please ? 
  the first few results i 've found indicate that the eu does n't outright ban rail nationalisation by any means . 
  it appears to be more complicated than that . 
  http://theconversation.com/fact-check-do-new-eu-rules-make-it-impossible-to-renationalise-railways-61180 http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/08/renationalise-railways-what-no-one-will-tell-you-we-cant-while-were-eu http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/sam-fowles/nationalisation-is-not-ag_b_8231336.html the general verdict appears to be along these lines  as far as renationalisation is concerned the reality is that , unless the rules are interpreted in an extreme way , they do not make it any easier or more difficult than the structure in place at the moment . 
  the only thing that the new system will almost certainly rule out is state monopolies that do not have to compete with rivals to win franchises , renationalised or otherwise . 
   ** implementing something the people really wanted ? 
  ** i did n't doubt that the eu had overruled the uk government in some cases , but this seems a far cry from `` the policies they campaigned on '' . 
  i doubt most people who cry `` sovereignty ! '', 
  actually knew the details of this case . 
  so it does n't really sound like you disagree with the original characterisation then ? 
   it does n't seem to be much more than some empty rhetoric which fits the ` either leave or be overrun by immigrants ' narrative . 
  but other than immigration , has the eu really done much to restrict the government implementing something the people really wanted ? 
   why vote for party x if i know they are inevitably going to have to water down their manifesto in order to create a government with party y ? 
  because it 's better than your party not getting any representation at all , do n't you think ? 
  your criticism only works under the assumption that you 're already voting for one of the big parties as your first choice , which may be true for you , but certainly not everyone else . 
  um , kind of the opposite , almost . 
  anyone born in northern ireland anyway is automatically entitled to both an irish and a british passport if they want them . 
  he even says as much  `` we have a house in italy , '' he added , `` and i do n't want to find myself queuing to get through rome airport every time i go there . '', 
  i actually linked to oatmeal 's comics directly at first before i realised that each half of the comic was a separate image . 
  that 's why it 's edited .

  i just do n't know what it has to do with my question .

  well now i 'm just more confused than before . 
   if you want to argue a technicality you can , but it just makes you look like you 're missing the point . 
  technically , you * are * right . 
  this is not what falls under the legal definition of murder . 
  but when someone says that the church is responsible for murdering babies , they 're not discussing the legal aspects , but the ethical ones . 
  `` murder '' is just used as shorthand for that . 
  the church killed babies through criminal negligence . 
  is that better ? 
   many people still remember the w\u00fcrselen debacle . 
   was there negligence ? 
  possibly , but there is no reason to think that kids were murdered , the official word for murder is homocide . 
  what you just described is [ negligent homicide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/negligent_homicide ) .

  he 's far from a fully-fledged fascist , but he certainly [ flirts with the concept ] ( http://www.rense.com/general37/fascism.htmhttp://www.rense.com/general37/fascism.htm ) to say the least . 
   dr. lawrence britt has examined the fascist regimes of hitler ( germany ) , mussolini ( italy ) , franco ( spain ) , suharto ( indonesia ) and several latin american regimes . 
  britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each :  ** 1 . 
  powerful and continuing nationalism ** - fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos , slogans , symbols , songs , and other paraphernalia . 
  flags are seen everywhere , as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays . 
  disdain for the recognition of human rights ** - because of fear of enemies and the need for security , the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of `` need . '', 
  the people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture , summary executions , assassinations , long incarcerations of prisoners , etc. 
  identification of enemies/scapegoats as a unifying cause ** - the people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe : racial , ethnic or religious minorities ; liberals ; communists ; socialists , terrorists , etc. 
  supremacy of the military ** - even when there are widespread domestic problems , the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding , and the domestic agenda is neglected . 
  soldiers and military service are glamorized . 
  rampant sexism ** - the governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated . 
  under fascist regimes , traditional gender roles are made more rigid . 
  divorce , abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution . 
  controlled mass media ** - sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government , but in other cases , the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation , or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives . 
  censorship , especially in war time , is very common . 
  obsession with national security ** - fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses . 
  religion and government are intertwined - governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion . 
  religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders , even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government 's policies or actions . 
  corporate power is protected ** - the industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power , creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite . 
  labor power is suppressed ** - because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government , labor unions are either eliminated entirely , or are severely suppressed . 
  disdain for intellectuals and the arts ** - fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education , and academia . 
  it is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested . 
  free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked . 
  obsession with crime and punishment ** - under fascist regimes , the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws . 
  the people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism . 
  there is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations . 
  rampant cronyism and corruption ** - fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability . 
  it is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders . 
  fraudulent elections ** - sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham . 
  other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates , use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries , and manipulation of the media . 
  fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections . 
  perhaps that 's not the best example considering you were only in that war in the first place by following america . 
  fun fact : trickle-down is also known as the `` horse and sparrows '' theory , because `` trickle-down theory - the less than elegant metaphor that if one feeds the horse enough oats , some will pass through to the road for the sparrows . '',

  interesting . 
  it 's probably to early to tell , but are there any ideas what her replacement might look like ? 
  i ca n't imagine they could be any more centrist than merkel . 
  if they do shift back to the right , would that cost cdu enough moderate voters to fundamentally shift the whole political landscape and be overtaken by spd ? 
  thanks , though i 'm not sure i understand the last bit . 
  if merkel 's relationship with csu been more strained than usual lately , why would she deliberately antagonise them even more ? 
  is it possible that she would ever go into a coalition without them , and has that ever happened before ? 
  ( sorry for so many questions ), 
  oh i 'm well aware , i 'm just asking how different it will really be , if they go from currently being junior partner with cdu , to becoming a * slightly bigger * junior partner with cdu .
