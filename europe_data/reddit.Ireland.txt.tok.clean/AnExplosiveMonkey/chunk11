  that was just an example . 
  also , do you mean that merkel will support it ? 
  is n't she alreadya little too centrist/too left for the liking of much of her own party 's conservative base ? 
  he 's entertaining at least , although i almost did n't recognise him with the new flair . 
   the traditional family model worked for thousands of years . 
  because why strive for change when inequality has worked for thousands of years ? 
  how much would spds proportion of votes matter if they 're still junior coallition partner to cdu ? 
  would n't merkel still get final say on stuff like gay marriage ? 
   cultural marxists well , the [ frankfurt school ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frankfurt_school#cultural_marxism_conspiracy_theory ) is in germany after all ... / s, 
   \u00dc i do n't know why you included that but i choose to believe it 's something like [ this ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fxykvyoamns/voci4oamzgi/aaaaaaaacky/zdf8x8ynrwi/s1600/7.png ), 
  do you know why ? 
  considering that she aligns pretty well with the core principles of brexit after all . 
  i 'm a little surprised by how well fillon did . 
  i guess many of those who did n't end up voting for le pen went with him instead . 
  `` alternative '' facts, 
  clearly a typo . 
  wales ? 
  right , but these would be the people who were intrigued by fn already , but not by enough . 
  this could make it enough for them . 
  by no means a lot of them , but they do exist , probably . 
  politics is a spectrum , kinda . 
  perhaps many fillon supporters , for example , would be torn between the final two , and this might be all it takes to nudge them over to le pen instead of macron . 
  that 's not what [ lame duck ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lame_duck_ ( politics \\ ) ) means . 
  very man, 
  now we just need the greek patron saint to be irish and the circle will be complete . 
  a [ turkish ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9qj9zc8xd4 ) turtle, 
  awww ... 
  well duh !, 
  it 's obviously only rigged if he 's the one that loses . 
  more like who does n't ? 
  / r/celticunion, 
  italian bottle . 
  he 's not saying that this was an inside job by le pen 's campaign , if that 's what you 're assuming . 
  i believe he 's saying that terrorists timed it this way to stoke fear which would improve le pens chances and increase support for the far-right , because a stronger far-right gives terrorists a bigger enemy , making them stronger in turn . 
  does n't seem that unreasonable to me . 
  why not both ? 
  ireland number one exporter of peat . 
  all other countries have inferior peat !, 
  not to be pedantic , but in what way would you be british ? 
  you 're northern irish or u.k. at most . 
  well that did n't take long ... 
  i know schulz 's rise has slowed down , but i thought it was still a lot closer than that ? 
  must have been a tough choice for them . 
  a kinky rabbit hole at that . 
  quite the hodgepodge of a word , you could even say . 
  ca n't unsee it . 
  be patient . 
  you 'll have your own election soon enough . 
  alternatively : alt + f4, 
  exactly , a.k.a. 
  the [ middle-ground fallacy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argument_to_moderation ), 
  also / r/cinemagraphs, 
  / r/brutalism you are not alone, 
  do you disagree with his statement that all radicals are assholes ? 
  of course some are * more * assholes than others . 
  at least we 're trending in the right direction . 
  though it would help if we had a viable party that was n't just another identical centre-right one . 
  no one said it did but you ? 
  cheese . 
  give it another two years , maybe . 
  i was thinking more along the lines of declaring war on iceland ... but i guess that works too . 
  what are you going to do about it ? 
  just guessing here but i 'd say it 's a combination of a few things , mainly having massively undeveloped infrastructure when we first joined , meaning we got lots of fund for all sorts of new roads , and also that agriculture is a big part of the economy , meaning that we benefit from the common agricultural policy , which makes up the bulk of eus expenses unless i 'm mistaken . 
  also , our higher gdp is a much more recent phenomenon , so maybe it 's just taking a while for things to catch up ? 
  ah , that would explain the sour taste . 
  ah , thanks . 
  i tried google translate but it could n't make sense of it . 
  so really there 's nothing we can do now but wait and see ? 
  / r/wholesomememes europe style !, 
  yep , investing in your people pays off . 
  [ we 're finally becoming a net contributor it seems ] ( http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/ireland-contributes-more-money-than-it-gets-to-eu-for-first-time-34815450.html ) . 
  huh , is that some sort of regional variation maybe ? 
  you would think that they 'd know what they 're talking about , since are n't they german themselves ? 
   eats apple hah !, 
  outsmarted . 
  i ca n't quite figure it out . 
  is [ that little rocket-man/baby-superpower near the end ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxuty7ss1v4&amp;t=7m15s ) supposed to be the uk or russia ? 
  i would 've thought russia would be the bigger superpower , but the bow tie is making me lean towards the uk . 
  whatever it is , it 's adorable . 
   to learn ** the language of the country that they are in ** * or * speak english . 
  in terms of integrating immigrants , so as long as you know dutch , i do n't see a problem . 
  that being said , english would be a bonus . 
  downvotes/dislikes do n't even make the youtube comment score go down either , unless i 'm mistaken ? 
  aaaaand , it 's already begun !, 
  somebody has to . 
   muslims , not so much . 
  the balkans have had large muslim populations for centuries . 
  they are european . 
  that is part of their society , their culture . 
  you would be right in saying that europe is not one homogenous melting pot , and that the situation might be different where you live , ** but ** , what you have yet to do is recognise that / u/rstcp is actually right here  it 's not pointless when there are millions of europeans who will only eat halal meat . 
  because it was in response to this claim :  those people are not europeans . 
  do you disagree that you can be muslim and european at the same time ? 
  ( e.g. 
  ~ 80 % of albania among others ) i do n't see how eu membership is relevant to this question . 
  you seem to be suggesting that muslims and jews should go back to their own countries , but you 've done nothing to indicate that you feel the same way about christians . 
  religion is a part of our society , like it or not . 
  i 'm atheist too , but why would i have a problem eating a certain type of meat just because other people are also able to eat it ? 
  if you do n't believe in any god , why should it bother you if someone said some ` magic ' words over the animal before it was killed ? 
  you seem to be well aware that it 's no different to the way it was before , so what 's the problem ? 
  then it 's a good thing we were talking about europe , not the eu .
