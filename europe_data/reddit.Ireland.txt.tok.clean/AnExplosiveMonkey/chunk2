  well modern hebrew spoken in israel today is actually arguably a lot closer to yiddish than it is to traditional hebrew . 
  it 's more like the amount of people who speak it and * not * also english is negligible . 
  i take it / r/swarje is the swedish equivalent of / r/murica ? 
  and if so what does the word mean ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/porn-sex-acts-banned-government-restrictions-full-list-fisting-periods-urine-public-a7433931.html ) , i guess ? 
  it 's easy to forget that england goes up that far . 
  at least for the rest of us i guess ... 
  there 's no winning really . 
  now sweden and norway put together form a more crudely drawn one pointing up . 
  i do n't doubt you i 'm just wondering why that is ? 
   ireland will strongly object . 
  why 's that ? 
  tax or something ? 
  sounds good to me . 
  \\* hint * \\* hint * scotland take note \\* nudge * \\* nudge *, 
   even merkel is already way to the left of the cdu . 
  how much longer do you think that might be ? 
  and would her replacement be just as left ? 
  and yet he 's still 8 seats below his 2010 peak it 's worth noting . 
  fair enough , though with the argentinian flair i would n't be surprised by someone knowing of the russian pale and not the irish one . 
  right , but it 's not the relevant pale for this case . 
  ehh ... [ not exactly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_pale ), 
  somehow that does n't quite come across as endearingly, 
  you 're honorary irish . 
  we 'll allow it . 
  eh , same thing , right ? 
   like nutters or small-time crooks who found religion . 
  a good way i 've heard this phrased is that what we 're seeing is n't so much the radicalisation of islam as it is the islamicisation of radicals . 
  right , we both agree that it 's a noteworthy part of culture . 
  we may disagree on how big a part it plays , but that 's not the point . 
  you seemed to suggest that someone ca n't call themselves patriotic without knowing the language , even though there are other aspects of the culture which they might embrace wholeheartedly . 
  that is what i disagreed with . 
  however i 'd argue that culture \u2260 language . 
  are irish people the same as australians and canadians simply because we all speak english ? 
  or is there more to culture than that ? 
   a monolingual english-speaker in ireland is culturally just an english colonial . 
  * and * you just managed to piss off about 4 million people at once . 
  that 's impressive !, 
  you now for once i 'd be grateful for a drama-free period , like from that lenin quote  `` there are decades where nothing happens ; and there are weeks where decades happen . '' `` nothing '' is starting to sound better and better .

  seems more like they 're pretty evenly divided now , no major new party . 
  nobody 's complaining about having to show voter id to prevent fraud ( which is n't even really a problem anyway ) . 
  it seems to work just fine in the netherlands precisely because ** they send out a card to everyone 's home ** , and that is the one you use . 
  the problem is when countries start requiring something like that from citizens who they have n't provided it to , and only accept certain other ids on a seemingly arbitrary basis , by which i mean politically motivated , e.g. 
  accepting [ hand gun licenses but not student ids ] ( https://newrepublic.com/article/119900/texas-voter-id-allows-handgun-licenses-not-student-ids ) . 
  poor you getting 10 + replies of the exact same thing .

  you know you 've screwed up when every country including america has come out to correct you . 
  what do you think it would take for pvda to eventually recover from this ? 
  is there really any chance of them being involved in another coalition with vvd after the amount of criticism they got for enabling them last time ? 
  right , but there are plenty of parties other than labour and tories that he addresses in the video . 
  the fact that it was even more extreme for one party in past years does n't really make it any better . 
  i believe that his point was this was the least representative parliament * overall * , when you factor in all the parties . 
  he deliberately does n't name any of the parties because of how divisive they can be , but how do you justify snp getting double seats because of how concentrated they were but ukip ( as much as i may dislike them ) getting only a single seat because they were more spread out ? 
  why would n't proportional representation ( i.e. 
  the dutch one in this very thread ) be better ? 
  ah , i knew something looked funny . 
  this is what i get for trusting autocorrect .

  interesting . 
  i get why turkey would be against someone trying to start up an independent country claiming land from it , but what reasoning could iraqi kurdistan have to oppose pkk as well , or is that just to appease turkey ? 
  just curious is all . 
  so what problems does turkey have with syrian kurds but not iraqi ones ? 
  at least then there 'll be more grounds for pushback i guess . 
  at this point it does n't look like there 'll be any painless way out of everything . 
   iraqi kurdistan wait what ? 
  i thought turkey was kind of attacking them ? 
  huh , [ interesting stuff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/politics_of_the_netherlands#1966.e2.80.931994 ) . 
  are their any visible indicators of using ww2 as a watershed or is it more for convenience ? 
  also , since i know nothing about this and am curious , would you say the last four years have been the closest yet to the purple coalition years , and if so , what 's that been like ? 
  any particular reason it happened then ? 
  it 's a viscous circle really . 
  since they know that they 're never going to win , there 's no incentive to be organised and realistic , so nobody takes them seriously , thus insuring that they 're never going to win .
