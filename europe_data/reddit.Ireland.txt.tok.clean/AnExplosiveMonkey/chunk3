   which would be gross to force a woman to carry a child she has no say in . 
  grosser than killing said child ? 
  not that i 'm saying she should have to carry it , i 'm pro-choice , but if you truly consider it to be ( potential of ) a life , then you 're kind of backing yourself into a corner when it comes to all the rape/incest/etc . 
  kind of cases . 
  oh well , back to the drawing board . 
  you 'll just have to think of another depressing reperenstative colour . 
  i suggest grey . 
  is n't the first one also called blue ? 
  it just seems like having a some level of checks and balances should be the default , rather than trusting politicians to always do the right thing on their own . 
  like the system in the us ( which we 've all seen is far from perfect but the point still stands ) where a majority (  50 ) is needed to pass anything in the senate , but the if the president disagrees he can veto that , but if his veto is a blatant abuse of power then the senate can veto his veto and force it through anyway with a supermajority ( 67 + ) . 
  it just seems weird that the people who made the law never envisioned the potential to abuse the power . 
  should n't you have to make the case that whatever you 're vetoing is actually particularly harmful to your minority ? 
  surely gay marriage affects all parties equally ? 
  so there 's no recourse at all ? 
  nobody to appeal to ? 
  i say that turkish delights must have some sort of multiplier effect on that good food bonus . 
  based on anything ? 
   boring politics is good politics . 
  but ... [ wo n't someone please think of the ratings ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4kvn4ot.gif ) !, 
  just good ol' projecting . 
  my personal favourite : * woman , without her , man is lost . 
  vs. * woman , without her man , is lost . 
  yeah but that constant self reinforcing polarisation can often just lead to two party systems like america where many in the middle are left unsatisfied . 
  [ perfect summary here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iayhg11cka ), 
  [ never not relevant xkcd ] ( https://xkcd.com/1274 ), 
  just a heads up , to fix your link you need to put a backslash , \\ , before any extra ' ) 's in the website 's name . 
  to get this [ sausages from potatoes ] ( http://www.garmazeria.com.pl/images/wyroby/kiszka%20ziemniaczana%20herman%20 ( 1 \\ ) . jpg ) you need to type this [ sausages from potatoes ] ( http://www.garmazeria.com.pl/images/wyroby/kiszka%20ziemniaczana%20herman%20 ( 1 \\ ) . jpg ) notice how `` 20 ( 1 ) . jpg ) '' goes to `` 20 ( 1 ** \\* * ) . jpg ) '', 
  i ca n't really see whether you 're arguing for or against it ? 
  personally i 'd prefer to err on the side of letting people do what they want as long as it does n't negatively impact anyone else . 
  i 'm just stating that these are the arguments against it . 
   ( i 've never heard of siblings being groomed for marriage ) first of all i 'm not limiting it to siblings . 
  parental grooming is probably more likely . 
  and unfortunately , either way , [ it has happened ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colt_clan_incest_case ) . 
  i agree these cases should n't have to ruin it for everyone , but you still have to acknowledge that these cases exist . 
  sure why not ? 
  the two main issues are potential increased chance of genetic mutation , and worries of grooming the child for the relationship while they 're still young . 
  if you could eliminate both of these , for example , gay brothers who were adopted separately and later met up and fell in love , then i do n't see any problem . 
  why ? 
  can i ask what changed ? 
  same . 
  it was a nice weekly tradition until i went through all of them in the local branch . 
  after that it unfortunately meant going to urlingford or wherever else to find some new ones . 
  also that `` do n't know '' should probably be in the middle , given that it is the neutral option after all . 
  thanks !, 
  i actually had this [ exact coversation ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/5ghf8k/why_not_honestly/daslp3z/?context=2 ) on / r/the _ donald a while ago . 
  on an unrelated not , i 've since been banned for not being a trump supporter , today in fact . 
  oh well , it was nice while it lasted . 
  and here i thought working to understand each other was a good thing . 
  also [ you ca n't just dismiss something because it 's from wikipedia ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/5oij9o/wikipedia_officially_adds_cnncom_to_list_of_fake/dck6tz9/?context=3 ) no , [ infowars is not a reliable news source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/5oij9o/wikipedia_officially_adds_cnncom_to_list_of_fake/dck81d4/?context=3 ) no , [ the crusades were not justified ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/5n7s6w/ted_cruz_introducing_legislation_to_declare_the/dcict8n/?context=3 ) no , [ breitbart is not `` independent press '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/5panxx/we_are_the_donald_and_we_support_blacks_browns/dcpy9m1/?context=3 ) no , [ all muslims should not be judged based on what terrorists do ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/5r7sow/go_to_fucking_hell_we_100_condemn_this_man_and/dd5o1xv/?context=3 ) in a weird way , i 'm kinda proud of my net positive karma score there . 
  it shows that as long as you 're gentle about it , people are willing to be corrected , to listen to reason . 
  any day where you can persuade someone that [ no , the nazis were not justified in going after jews because they had money ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/5ghf8k/why_not_honestly/dat0z7r/?context=3 ) is a good day . 
  sorry about that , i guess i kinda just needed to vent . 
  i guess not that many big boats have to come up the liffey . 
   there 's not enough people from donegal to satisfy the need for northern accents in ireland . 
  my mocks irish aural/listening exam says otherwise :(, 
  and another tiny percentage in battery life improvements , and another tiny percentage in helicopter rotor efficiency and another percentage in radar advancements and another in water filtration and another in the heat and radiation proof suits now worn by race car drivers and nuclear power plant operators . 
  also improvements in planes ' autopilot , exoskeleton suits that help disabled people walk , insulation film , and even the ubiquitous ear thermometer . 
  the list goes on and on . 
  so yes , each one may only be a small improvement on it 's own , but they add up quickly . 
   if it were just about that , it would probably be much more efficient to spent the money on technologies applicable on earth directly . 
  but the thing about r&d is that you do n't always know what you 're going to get out of it . 
  [ teflon for example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polytetrafluoroethylene#applications_and_uses ) was originally developed for heat shields and space suits , but is now most commonly known for non-stick pans . 
  this one 's nasa-specific , but it gets the point across http://wtfnasa.com/, 
  do n't be ridiculous !, 
  that looks way too nice out for it to be britain !, 
   hell polish is now the 2nd most spoken language here with irish falling into 3rd spot . 
  if anything this is what surprises me the most . 
  i definitely would n't have thought that irish was still the 2nd most spoken language until 2012 . 
  ( i know that this is a different figure to what we were just talking about , but ) i always find it a little ridiculous when people claim to be irish speakers just because they once took it in school . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/number-of-irish-speakers-up-by-7-1-1.491468 ), 
  i knew i forgot one . 
  quitaly 's still my favourite though . 
  exactly , people who move to the uk are called ` immigrants ' , but if someone in the uk wants to move elsewhere , they 're justified by being called an ` ex-pat ' instead . 
  some people ca n't seem to realise that one country 's emigrants are another countries immigrants . 
   scotland northern ireland and wales have joined ireland / r/celticunion, 
  because you do n't have a memorable enough portmanteau nickname . 
  take a look at italy , they have a few to spare - `` quitaly '' , `` italeave '', 
  / r/celticunion ( with the exception of london but that could be negotiable ), 
  they actually did it / r/madlads, 
  i suppose the corkonians are . 
  ( i admit i had to look up that word ), 
  oh well , just time to sink back into the ocean , i guess . 
  they had a good run at least . 
  from what i 've heard , he just was n't as big a character as france 's presidents of the past . 
   `` as a president i will be like the candidate that i am , a respectful candidate , a rallying candidate , a normal candidate for a normal presidency , at the service of the republic . '', 
   - francois hollande it 's not so much that he did anything wrong , but that he was n't seen as doing enough right , which is when charisma matters most . 
  whatever you can say of sarkozy and the like , they were definitely charismatic , and it might just be the case that france simply does n't want a `` normal '' president , they want a `` strong '' president , whatever that might be . 
  edit : a letter, 
   i ca n't tell you whether the prevailing view is either of those opinions or something else entirely . 
  i think the discussion is more nuanced than you let on . 
  your best argument seems to be that `` now while it may seem to be bigoted on the surface , there 's no way of knowing for sure , so lets just give everybody the benefit of the doubt over their motivations for depriving other people of rights . '' ? 
   furthermore , trump is n't even from the south ?? 
  frankly here you just seem determined to continually miss my point , repeatedly . 
  i thought we were having a better debate than that . 
  i 'm well aware trump 's not even from the south . 
  i did address that , remember ? 
  - `` i know with that last example i 'm veering a little off topic of the south , but it makes my point that sometimes , politicians go past the point of being simply conservative , and into the territory of bigotry . '', 
  same goes for this :  as for the transgender issue , i believe trumps tweet cited the medical issue that you just conceded to . 
  i conceded that the medical issue could conceivably be a reason for not covering medical costs . 
  i have yet to see a good reason why that then extends into banning all trans people from serving , even if they 've already transitioned .
