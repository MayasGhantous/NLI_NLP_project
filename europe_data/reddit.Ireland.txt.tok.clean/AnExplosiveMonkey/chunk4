   and lets not get into the competing virtues of party politicians . 
  i 'm happy to leave the conversation at an agreement that both parties politicians are equally spineless and appalling . 
  i 'm not even going to get into the `` both parties are the same '' debate , as my intention was n't to hold one above the other . 
  my intention was to point out that bigotry more often overlaps with conservative politicians than with liberal ones , that it is more accepted by conservative ones than liberal ones . 
  if you disagree , please explain why , and not just with some `` you ca n't generalise like that we have no way of knowing '' kind of defensive crap . 
  you 're the only one who keeps bringing extreme internet distorted viewpoints into this . 
  which is why i 'm trying to move past that , to use specific examples in my comments . 
  if you wish to progress this conversation , can you please answer these questions i already asked :  out of everyone who opposes gay marriage , which reasoning do you think is more prevalent : ? 
   - god says no/ew , that 's icky !, 
   - people who wo n't be making children should n't be getting the tax benefits that come along with marriage in the eyes of the state . 
   tell me with a straight face that alabama 's opposition to gay marriage is over economic aspects and not bigotry . 
   likewise , try and argue that there are just as many liberal counterparts to moore . 
  likewise , trump banning trans people from serving in the military . 
  do n't get me wrong , i may disagree with it , but i could see a reasonable conservative argument being put forward saying that it 's a personal choice and that therefore the military should n't have to pay for the medical treatment . 
  that 's not what he did . 
  what he did , was to deny people who are perfectly capable the ability to serve , for no good reason . 
  if not bigotry , than what is it ? 
  i know with that last example i 'm veering a little off topic of the south , but it makes my point that sometimes , politicians go past the point of being simply * conservative * , and into the territory of bigotry . 
  you can point to fringe blm protesters or whatnot , but i have yet to see any examples of * liberal politicians * equally straying into bigotry so easily . 
  that 's kind of my point though . 
  you could perhaps argue that there are reasonable points to be made against gay marriage , but those are n't the ones politicians campaign on , nor the ones the voters focus on either . 
  out of everyone who opposes gay marriage , which reasoning do you think is more prevalent : ? 
  - god says no/ew , that 's icky !, 
  - people who wo n't be making children should n't be getting the tax benefits that come along with marriage in the eyes of the state . 
  tell me with a straight face that alabama 's opposition to gay marriage is over economic aspects and not bigotry . 
  hell , there 's a significant chance that alabama 's next senator will be roy moore , the state supreme court chief justice who was ** twice ** suspended from being unable to keep religion out of his job , one of those times for ordering clerks within his state to ignore the federal ruling legalising gay marriage . 
  of course you can be conservative without being racist/bigoted . 
  new england and california have plenty of reasonable conservative politicians . 
  now , tell me with a straight face that roy moore is one of those reasonable ones , and not just a bigot . 
  likewise , try and argue that there are just as many liberal counterparts to moore . 
  opposing gay marriage ? 
  you never hear people calmly making points about tax details or whatnot . 
  it 's always `` sodomy is a sin ! '', 
  `` adam and * eve * not adam and steve ! '', 
  how about there 's a significantly higher * correlation * between bigoted/racist and conservative ideas , than bigoted/racist and liberal ideas ? 
  so by voting in more conservative politicians , one is also voting in more racist/bigoted politicians ? 
  we ca n't just agree that some things are objectively bigoted/racist ? 
  really ? 
  it seems to me more like `` your political views are ultimately bigoted in effect , regardless of your reasoning for them , and even if they 're not , you vote for someone anyway who * does * support those views '' . 
  lol , even that picture is about something now forgotten ( kinda ) . 
  if the current poll numbers more or less hold up , those two td 's might be all it takes to make a difference , although come to think of it , if it 's that close they 'd probably rather wrangle some independents instead . 
  basically whether the deal in which ireland got 26 out of the 32 counties on the island was good enough for the time being , or if we should have refused and fight for them all . 
  i 'm no fan of ff , but if they had to go into coalition with a load of left wing parties like sf and greens and/or socdems , just to get over the halfway mark , you would n't see me complaining . 
  [ who ] ( https://m0.her.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/22222207/screen-shot-2016-09-22-at-22.11.32.png ) you calling creepy ? 
  to keep it warmer for longer . 
  it acts as insulation . 
  what do you think would happen when he eventually steps down , and when might that be ? 
   i know nothing about him oh where to begin ? 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwvmnkcrugw ) is a classic favourite of mine and usually a good place to start . 
  and not to mention he 's a surprisingly popular figure to make tea cozies out of . 
  [ michael `` tea '' higgins , if you will ] ( https://cloud.lovindublin.com/images/michael-tea-higgins.png?mtime=20170104122541 ) . 
  i mean , what else do you really need to know ? 
   the irish title uachtar\u00e1n comes from the word uachtar meaning ` cream ' -- as in `` the cream of the crop '' huh , i feel like that 's something i should have known . 
  it makes so much sense in hindsight . 
   they [ i ] all [ / i ] fyi , italics in reddit is done by putting an asterisk on either side of a word , e.g. 
  \\* all * gives you * all * check the ` formatting help ' button for more information . 
  oh single market * easily * . 
  the uk may be our biggest * single * trade partner , but is still nowhere near the rest of the eu put together . 
  also on top of that , it would look worse for the uk to be the only ones , all out on their own , and we live a good chance to make them look bad . 
  ok ... you still never answered the question . 
  sorry for presuming anything , i guess , now are you actually going to answer why you felt the need to include that in the list ? 
  go ahead , be my guest . 
  do you recognise that you were kind of being a cunt on the internet there ? 
  nah , the tax stuff is slow , planned and predictable . 
  brexit is anything but , and we stand [ to lose the most ] ( https://www.dfa.ie/media/dfa/alldfawebsitemedia/ourrolesandpolicies/ourwork/statevisit2014/economic-facts.pdf ), 
  wait , what ? 
  details please . 
  i ca n't seem to find anything on it . 
  there 's too much there too properly tackle all at once , but can i just take the time to point out that you included this in your list of `` bad things '' ? 
  lol . 
   gay men are twice as likely as straight men to be in interracial relationships . 
  source : http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/93/4/1423  you ca n't even use some ethno-nationalist argument here about `` preserving '' the bloodline and the native race of the country , since gay people are n't going to be having children anyway . 
  this is just pure xenophobia for xenophobia 's sake . 
  ouch . 
  we 've somewhat climbed back up from the depths of the recession , but who knows how brexit will change that . 
  so is gingerness . 
  being `` different '' is n't an argument on it 's own . 
  so now a `` normal union '' is actually different to a gay one ? 
  i thought they had equal rights , and the only difference was ` nature ' ? 
  you 're all over the place . 
  if adoption is one of these rights derived from nature , then both gay and sterile people should n't be able to adopt . 
  if it 's not `` derived from nature '' but instead a legal matter , then it should be included in the equal rights you claim same sex couples should have . 
  which is it ? 
   what about you go fuck yourself ...  instead of being a cunt on the internet ? 
  umm ... 
  conversely , the other two predominately catholic countries which come to mind are spain and ireland . 
  spain was one of the early adopters of gay marriage ( fourth overall ) , while ireland was the first to do so by referendum , and by a large margin too ( 62 % to 38 % ) . 
  food for thought, 
  thank you for that experience . 
  it 's interesting the amount of them that appear in straight lines on the sea , like between sweden and finland , or finland and estonia . 
  i get that there are ferrys and what not , but i would n't have thought that they 'd be such tweeting hotspots . 
  what if it 's a liquid ? 
  maybe . 
  i guess i would have expected them to be much further west . 
  i 've never noticed the dots on the bottom before . 
  i wonder if they 're to represent the few spanish cities in north africa . 
  they meant economically liberal . 
  perhaps fiscally conservative . 
  lose them only to afd , a party who will never be in government , which from merkel 's point of view is much more preferable than losing them to your opposition , which might be enough to help them into power . 
  especially if merkel likely retires after one last time as chancellor , and the cdu then swings back a little to the right , after all her years of centrism .
