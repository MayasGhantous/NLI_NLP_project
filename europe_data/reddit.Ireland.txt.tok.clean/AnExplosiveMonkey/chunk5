  as in low taxes , little regulation , little government welfare , pro-business , pro privatisation . 
  looks more like you have an unwanted growth now . 
  care to explain ? 
  although since it 's been more than a year since that , they are now able to try again legally by now . 
  i 'm just so impressed that i do n't really mind . 
  why the change in 2014 ? 
  is it starting to level off ? 
  so the votes are there to repeal it , but it 's a question of whether or not pp will actually put it up to a vote ? 
  what 's your opinion on the likelihood of that happening ? 
  what about it ca n't be discharged ? 
   an outrageous measure taken by the spanish government ( conservative pp party ) are n't they only a minority though ? 
  would n't it need the support of another party ? 
  shhh ... they have a lot on their hands . 
  so when did they ? 
  how much does this mess with your ability to sleep ? 
  do you need black-out curtains ? 
  well if that 's how we 're doing it , what makes sweden any different ? 
  they 're referencing christ , not christianity , and even then it 's the year more than anything else . 
  it 's safe to assume which god germany is referring to . 
  you take that back . 
  yep , pretty much , as / u/kroa12 said , even down to the orgies . 
  [ worth a listen if you have a few spare hours ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x79mw1gwtj8 ), 
  we forgive you . 
  much better . 
  [ relevant satw ] ( https://satwcomic.com/art/be-careful-what-you-say.jpg ), 
  that 's definitely more than most . 
  you pass , no need to be modest .

   or irish nations are among the ... 
  in no way has this prevented them from remaining overwhelmingly homogeneus in terms of ethnic/national/racial identity , thus sparing themselves ... once upon a time , maybe , but [ things have changed fast ] ( http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/features/ireland-learns-to-love-its-growing-multiculturalism-360629.html ) . 
  sorry , but you 're going to have to find yourself a different example . 
  you 're starting to slip . 
  what do you mean ? 
  does n't that apply to everyone ? 
  what did you expect ? 
  it takes some attention off of them . 
  [ from the man himself .

  yeah , i 've really become a politics junky over the last year or so . 
  a lot of the stuff is specific to america , but taking [ this ] ( https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/handicapping-the-georgia-6-special-election/ ) as an example , i love the level of detail and thought and how much sense you can make of it all through maths . 
  sovereignty ? 
  did we just read the same comment ? 
  to * whom * hah !, 
   ( homo torius conservativus ) i 'm not so sure they 'd approve of the * homo * , 
  yeah , [ 538 actually just did a good piece on exactly that : `` donald trump is making europe liberal again '' ] ( https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trump-is-making-europe-liberal-again/ ) ( liberal mostly meaning left-wing ) . 
  finally something good comes of this . 
  who 's there ? 
  nice relevant username . 
  for a second i thought this was the french parliament election thread and i was * really * confused . 
  in that case then , ( as a complete outsider ) my dream coalition would probably be something like pvda , groenlinks , d66 , sp , and * maybe * vvd if they 're willing to compromise . 
  do you ever see them getting into government ? 
  ouch , really ? 
  i liked him , but he was doomed to be dragged down by his party . 
  i wonder why it seems to jump up again going from germany to czechia . 
  i 'm guessing mountains or something , but that would n't explain why it 's the only inland area that acts like that . 
  they 're automatically included as part of the eea , along with iceland and liechtenstein . 
  coalition of chaos !, 
  just keep them quarantined in kerry and everybody 's happy . 
  i 'm pretty sure we 'd let her stay pm if it meant avoiding that . 
  same , then my civilization 5 memories kicked in . 
   hymen deliberate ? 
  huh , that almost ruins it a little . 
  i remember seeing speculation before on whether or not it could be the same lord buckethead who ran against past pms such as thatcher of john major , but if they announce their names , there 's no more mystery . 
  oh well , my solution is just stay ignorant anyway . 
  and is represented by a vicar 's daughter .

  link and/or translation and/or tl : dr ? 
  that 's not what * i * believe . 
  some people seem to think snp = good for scotland and therefore good for scotland = bad for england . 
  it 's like she 's counting on people not realising that she 's already had the power to do , and failed to do , many of the things she is now promising . 
  / r/emuwarflashbacks, 
  what about the great emu war ? 
  except those * are * some pretty quality flags there , do n't you think ? 
  that last one 's practically vantablack .

  of course they do ? 
  i feel like you 're trying to disagree with me for the sake of disagreeing with me . 
   2 ) the two are completely possible throughout most of europe . 
  right , but until the legislative battle finishes to hypothetically transition over to that , why not let gay people get married ? 
   and how is it less than marriage ? 
  marriage does n't equate to love , and marriage is more commonly being seen as a regressive burden . 
  did you check the link i gave you a few comments back ? 
  there are many differences between the two . 
  that is not up for debate . 
  here 's a sample  and yet some very important inequalities remain . 
  for example , civil partnership : - does not permit children to have a legally recognised relationship with their parents - only the biological one . 
  this causes all sorts of practical problems for hundreds of families with schools and hospitals as well as around guardianship , access and custody . 
  in the worst case , it could mean that a child is taken away from a parent and put into care on the death of the biological parent . 
  - does not recognise same sex couples ' rights to many social supports that may be needed in hardship situations and may literally leave a loved one out in the cold . 
  - defines the home of civil partners as a `` shared home '' , rather than a `` family home '' , as is the case for married couples . 
  this has implications for the protection of dependent children living in this home and also means a lack of protection for civil partners who are deserted . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.marriagequality.ie/marriageaudit/full-list ) 's the full list of 160 differences  3 ) if a priest is willing to , but the organisation he works for does n't , surely he needs to change organisations ?
