  on its own , sure it may not be enough . 
  but it 's a start . 
  it 's not meant to be on its own , it 's meant to be built on , just like how they 're have been many other deals in the past , before paris ( kyoto and copenhagen off the top of my head ) . 
  climate tariffs would just make my day . 
  what makes it even worse is that for * ages * now , when it 's come to agreements like these , america 's standpoint has been something along the line of `` well sure , * we * want to help combat climate change , but how do we now that if we reduce * our * emissions , all the other countries wo n't just keep polluting and take advantage of our efforts ? '', 
  and now eu , china , india , you name it , have all signed up , but that 's no longer good enough . 
  ameica 's doing the exact thing that they accused others of doing not so long ago . 
  from their above average height ... 
  wow , insulted by wiktionary . 
  i really do n't know where there 's left to go from that . 
  i guess , it just seems a strange thing to wonder about one country over others . 
  like , all country 's names have some sort of meaning if you go back far enough , but it 's not usually the kind of thing you 'd google . 
  i 'm not even sure i could tell you why ireland is called ireland . 
  you started it !, 
   called france i 'm not really sure what kind of answer those people expect for that . 
  so * that * 's where they went !, 
  [ yes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/icelandic_name ), 
  so eventually those 300 will die off ? 
  what are the legal reasons for switching to a surname ? 
  and there have been many contenders for that . 
  why is there a picture of an empty white outline ? 
  true , but then there are also more costs as well , such as healthcare . 
  well that just goes without saying . 
  he 's clearly too drunk to answer . 
  what 'd she do to piss of thatcherites ?

  good god , that sounded plural for a second .

  it complements their 2.3 popes per square km ( or 4.6 if you count old benny ) . 
  do you know the reasoning for pc 's downfall ? 
  no , you just do n't get it . 
  when * other * people do it , they 're dirty immigrants , but when * i * do it , it makes me an `` ex-pat '' . 
  i do n't really see any other interpretation unless you think that i might believe we should ban electricity ? 
  just going to leave [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/akof4wy.jpg ) here ... 
  exactly !, 
  what 's not to like ? 
  you have your own reasons for your position , as you are entitled to , but that 's not really what i 'm getting at . 
   the day we have to have id cards is the day that we admit we no longer trust people 's word . 
  do you trust tories ' words ? 
   the day we have to have id cards is the day that we admit we no longer trust people 's word .

  sorry , i did n't mean to bring brexit into this , but talking about trusting people 's word is a bit rich do n't you think ? 
  and of course * `` poronkusema '' * , meaning the distance a reindeer can travel before having to piss again , roughly 7-10km . 
  actually the wiki page is pretty clear that a pile of rocks does * not * qualify as a building . 
   this article lists the oldest free-standing buildings constructed in the world , including on each of the continents and within each country . 
  `` building '' is defined as any human-made structure used or interface for supporting or sheltering any use or continuous occupancy . 
  in order to qualify for list a structure must : be a recognisable building ;  incorporate features of building work from the claimed date to at least 1.5 metres ( 4.9 ft ) in height ;  be largely complete or include building work to this height for most of its perimeter . 
   contains an enclosed area with at least one entry point . 
   this consciously excludes ruins of limited height and statues . 
  the list also excludes :  dolmens -- a type of single-chamber megalithic tomb , usually consisting of three or more upright stones supporting a large flat horizontal capstone -- unless they were originally covered over to form a barrow and used for collective burials . 
  ( neolithic dolmens are extremely numerous , with over 1,000 reported from mecklenburg-vorpommern in germany alone . ), 
   cairns which are simply large piles of loose stones ( as opposed to chambered cairns . ), 
   dates for many of the oldest structures have been arrived at by radiocarbon dating and should be considered approximate . 
  fair enough . 
   there is n't just a normal , neutral ( and most of all honest ) place to go so i just go to all of them . 
  thoughts on / r/neutralpolitics ? 
   the numbers speak for themselves . 
  ah , but numbers ca n't talk !, 
  therefore you are clearly using fake news / s, 
   between the crackjobs on t_d i 'm honestly curious . 
  why do you post there so much if that 's your true opinion of them ? 
   is there just a normal , centrist , moderate place that the 12 non mentally ill people on reddit can talk reasonably ? 
  let me introduce you to / r/neutralpolitics .

  good morning !, 
  it 's worth noting that all of those bridges are actually made up , so as not to feature some countries and not others , but instead exude a general european architectural atmosphere ... ... and then the netherlands just had to [ go and build them all anyway .

  `` in my experience , there 's been water intrusion at the front of the tunnel every single year . '', 
  i 'd say the regular centre-left parti socialists would be bernie level ( e.g. 
  proposing universal / r/basicincome ) , whereas macron would be more like clinton style standard democrats ( just check out / r/neoliberal , who seem to love both macron and hillary ) . 
   the government is a reasonable reflection of aggregate irish political opinion . 
  why ? 
  they 're the best fit sure , but as in every country , it 's always going to be far from a proper reflection . 
  as a single point , the average age of a td is about 50 , the average age of the general population is more like 36 . 
  older people always tend to lag behind on social or technological issues . 
  that should n't be a surprise .

  of course they do n't encompass the * whole * party , but both of these statements are reflective of the current leadership of the two parties at the moment , as well as their general atmosphere . 
  so why did you then ? 
  were n't you saying that they will also be seizing it alone ? 
  even though they * are * in the common market ? 
   ** as will ** switzerland , as will norway , as will iceland . 
  / r/celticunion, 
  so to clarify , you believe that the uk will be in a * better * position than those countries to seize it alone , by * not * being in the common market ?
