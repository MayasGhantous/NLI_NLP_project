   and only 23 % of norwegians support our current eea agreement ( mai 2017 poll ) huh , really ? 
  can you show that ? 
  as far as i was aware , the main reason that norway was in the eea but not the eu is that the eu affects fishing rights while the eea does n't . 
  what arguments are used against being in the eea ? 
   i have not seen any data to support this . 
  true . 
  i ca n't imagine there being many polls for this kind of thing . 
  though considering how much more integrated with the rest of continental europe those countries are , i ca n't see any scenario in which they 'd completely cut all ties . 
   the fact that they have chosen to be outside the eu with different models from the uk 's model of being outside the eu is not the main point here . 
  * their * model , is being kind of half-way in , so to speak . 
  the uk 's model , is more like an absence of a model , since ( regardless of its past ) it would not be treated any differently than any other non-eu country , hence my comparison to brazil , japan , and uzbekistan . 
  i guess my question is this : without talking about its geographical proximity or its past , how would the uk 's potential ( single-marketless ) future situation be any closer to norway 's than brazil 's ? 
   no , i meant that just as a majority of the people in norway , iceland and switzerland are in favour of remaining outside the eu , so to will the majority of the people in the uk . 
  you seem to be overlooking the simple fact that the * reason * why people in those countries are in favour of remaining outside the eu , is because they already get a lot of the advantages from being in the common market . 
  that 's an important detail , do n't you think ? 
  i 'm sure if those countries had the choice between either full membership , or not being in the common market , they 'd choose full membership . 
  if that 's the case , then they would n't be comparable to the uk , which opted for the opposite . 
  [ sexist !, 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/12/kellyanne-conway-accuses-anderson-cooper-sexism-eye-roll/ ), 
  when you said this  i suspect that the british population will start to consolidate around a majority being in favour of remaining outside the eu , just like norway , iceland and switzerland . 
  i assumed you meant remaining outside the eu , in * comparable situations * to norway , iceland , and switzerland . 
  if you did n't mean that second part and only meant simply outside the eu , then could n't your examples may as well have been brazil , japan and uzbekistan ? 
  i assumed there was a * reason * you chose those specific countries . 
  was i wrong ? 
  eurovision is a cruel mistress . 
  right , but the ** first ** month * is * free if you 're a new customer . 
  right , but i 'm not talking about the eu . 
  i 'm talking about the single market , which is not the same thing . 
  * you * advocated for the uk being more like norway , iceland and switzerland . 
  they are all in the single market , including freedom of movement . 
  without joining the single market , i do n't see how you can say the uk would be like them . 
  free , you could even say . 
  and yet they 're all in the single market , i.e. 
  freedom of movement , which was possibly the biggest reason for brexit , no ? 
  as much as i hate to admit it , it 's probably got a lot to do with the fact that originally we were one of the few countries to sing in english , without the dislikability of actually * being english * .

  for spring i 'd beg to differ . 
  hordes of spanish have been roaming my town for over a month . 
  though looking closer at it now , it seems the figure is in comparison to last year 's number at the same time , so seasonal employment would n't be a factor after all . 
  that just seems to me like the same argument for never raising the minimum wage , despite the fact that inflation means it buys a lot less now . 
  yes , if you raise the minimum wage , there might be a small amount of people who do n't get hired as a result , but most employers will just pay the new amount . 
  likewise , if you get rid of zero-hour contracts , there might be a small subset of people who lose out ( and something should be done to help them ) , but most other employers will be forced to give proper reliable jobs to their employees , offering them a peace of mind that you ca n't put a number on . 
  i 'm afraid i just do n't really see the difference between the two scenarios . 
  i was referring to the idea of zero hour contracts supposedly being a good thing because `` they 're better than nothing '' . 
  does this have something to do with seasonal tourism jobs ? 
   what happens to all the people who are on those contracts ? 
  they wo n't all be hired and will eventually just end up on the dole , then again it 's just a sentence , i can only assume they have some sort of plan .
