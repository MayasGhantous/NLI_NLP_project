  why bother having a minimum wage ? 
  surely if we abolished it then that would create more jobs , right ? 
  at a certain point , it 's the quality of the jobs that matter , not the quantity . 
  no different than scotland or wales afaik , having both local assemblies and contributions to the national parliament . 
  i suppose , though some of those at least are specific names , as in , the name of an actual town , and not just a geographical feature , so they never seemed as odd . 
  oh i know , it 's just the way you said it made me think of the name ` le pen ' in terms other then politics . 
  perhaps something like `` the left multiplies by dividing '' ? 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( https://xkcd.com/927/ ), 
  that is the british way . 
  i 've been so caught up in the election that i did n't really realise until now how weird it is to have a surname that 's two words . 
  apparently it means `` the head '' , `` the chief '' , or `` the peninsula '' . 
  [ attero domiatus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iwmyadgu18 ), 
  and of course penistone . 
  i think what he 's saying is that you do n't * even need * to be progressive to support the eu anyway , considering how much it 's benefited ireland , regardless of progressive or conservative . 
  `` you 're taking them literally , not seriously . '', 
   and from what i 've seen of irish redditors here , they 're aware that the apple-type cases need to go . 
  you do n't know just how frustrating it is watching your own government refuse $ 13 billion that the eu ordered apple to pay . 
  i understand why they did , and that technically that since it was a once off windfall it would all have to go to paying off debt anyway , as per the bailout agreements , but still , 13 billion is almost $ 3000 for every man woman and child in the country . 
  there 's got to be more to it than that . 
  the house always wins , therefore if you 're voting randomly , you always lose over time . 
  if it were that simple why would n't everyone do it ? 
  it almost is though . 
  i wonder is there a french equivalent ? 
  obligatory / r/bluemidterm2018, 
  is there any other ? 
  it never seemed to occur to him why the odds were so good ... 
  lol at `` we need to focus on us '' . 
  i wonder what caused that pivot ? 
  it 's beautiful . 
  the schadenfreude is real . 
  if they could just fracture themselves into many little pieces , that 'd be great . 
  there 's an [ ad for the irish national lottery ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p04_kirfpui ) based on exactly that . 
  huh , and apparently some even advocate going further , for a [ `` quinary '' sector ] ( https://www.thoughtco.com/sectors-of-the-economy-1435795 ) , specific to administrative activities . 
  that [ whole episode ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2g9hnr ) is . 
  i do n't really see why `` knowledge-based services like consultation , education , financial planning , blogging , and designing '' do n't count as services ? 
  cool . 
  that sums it up well . 
  that 's the democratic people 's republic of korea to you !, 
  it just makes you wonder , what about could you actually call royalty at that point ? 
  ah , that makes sense . 
  well shit , [ you were n't kidding ] ( http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/garda-launch-blasphemy-probe-into-stephen-fry-comments-on-the-meaning-of-life-35684262.html ) . 
  and here i thought we were rapidly moving in the right direction . 
  is n't the whole point of royalty that it 's * not * electable , * not * subject to the opinion of the masses ? 
  edit : ok , i get it . 
  it 's more complicated than that . 
  royalty is now electable ? 
  ( radiation ) burn !, 
  what changes were these ? 
   would replace english as the lingua franca ? 
  i will never not appreciate the irony that french is not the lingua ' * franca * ' . 
  roughly `` tahw , kin-cha '' also now that i read someone else pointing out that french leave a space before question marks , i 'm noticing it everywhere . 
  it 's not that you do n't have a valid point , but the 100km mark is by no means just used by astronauts and scientists . 
  just try typing `` where does space start ? '', 
  into google . 
  depends on how you define ` space ' . 
  for * most * people , that would be above 100km . 
  that 's a little pedantic , do n't you think ? 
  so no traffic light either then ? 
  `` our cute fluffy horses , who ca n't even figure out how to have sex on their own . '', 
  that sounds like a ringing endorsement if i ever heard one . 
  do you seriously not see how turkey is more relevant to europe than china ? 
  part of turkey * is fucking in europe !, 
  * i do n't see china threatening to open the gates to millions of refugees either . 
   so if this was about saudi arabia if * what * was about saudi arabia ? 
  them giving panda gifts ? 
  i think i 'm beginning to see the confusion . 
  the reason why there are few ( but not no ) posts about china 's human rights records , is because that , ** on its own ** , has nothing to do with europe . 
  * however * , when an article like this does come up , you * are free * to raise the issue if it 's relevant . 
  you did n't really do that so much as you pre-emptively accused everyone here of having an agenda , so do n't act surprised if the reaction to that is n't exactly positive . 
  ... because that has nothing to do with europe , while this does ? 
  [ china 's panda diplomacy , explained ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr2gpide4fi ), 
  sounds like all we need is another gulf war / s, 
   took until his 2nd term for things to come crashing down actually , going from the 1205 days number , that works out to be a little less than four years , meaning he was more disliked than he was liked by the end of his first term , and still got reelected anyway . 
  he does a good zoidberg impression .

  i too do n't know if this is what macron is talking about , but check out [ germany 's electoral system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electoral_system_of_germany ) . 
  it means you still get local representation , but the overall number from each party is actually proportional to their share of the vote too .

  have any openly declared that they 're switching parties yet ?

  here 's [ hangul ] ( https://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/3968335_700b.jpg ) . 
  try it , it 's quite easy . 
  and here 's the [ cyrillic ] ( http://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aqzbpmp_700b_v1.jpg ) one too . 
  how much sway do the rest of v4 have over any one of its member countries ? 
  have akp/erdogan also been in power for that long ? 
  also , i have no idea how much it counts for , but apparently singapore is the least corrupt country in asia , and [ 7th least corrupt in the world ] ( http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-climbs-to-7th-on-global-least-corrupt-index ) . 
  in general ud agree with you , that several more or less evenly matched viable parties are what make for the strongest democracies , but singapore seems to be the exception that proves the rule . 
  hey i did n't say that it was perfect , far from it , just that calling it a `` sham '' of a democracy is n't quite right either . 
  much obliged, 
  yes they are , how observant of you ... 
  i dabbled in a little cyrillic but have since forgotten a good chunk of it . 
  meanwhile hangul ( korean ) is so ordered and consistent that it 's practically impossible to forget . 
  well ... it is and it is n't . 
  * sure * , there 's only ever been one party in power , but on the other hand , they 've done such a good job that the public do n't want anyone else in charge , so they keep voting for them . 
  you better not be getting my hopes up .
