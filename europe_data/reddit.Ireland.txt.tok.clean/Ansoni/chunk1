they have declared the uk as an enemy and target . 
  they might not be able to do anything about it , but they did that much . 
  it worked really well for a few hundred years but then people gave up . 
  poor misunderstood good guy england , trying to keep our heritage alive for all these years we rebel * tear * . 
  you can support the revival of the language without supporting delusional politicians who act as if revival already succeeded . 
  dude , japan . 
  you need so much japan in you right now . 
  alcohol is sold in 24 hour convenience stores , and outdoor vending machines . 
  they also have a tonne of all-you-can-drink bars , going at like $ 30 for three hours . 
  i do n't know about where you live but in japan it 's legal and socially acceptable to drink outdoors . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ there 's ^ ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ ^ lovely ^ ^ ^ ^ exotic ^ ^ ^ ^ scenery , ^ ^ ^ ^ rich ^ ^ ^ ^ historical ^ ^ ^ ^ locations , ^ ^ ^ ^ kind ^ ^ ^ ^ locals ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ very ^ ^ ^ ^ likely ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ best ^ ^ ^ ^ eating ^ ^ ^ ^ industry ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ world . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ pfff, 
  irish survived being forbidden . 
  but when it was permitted it was valueless and actually costly to schools to teach , unlike english . 
  paying by results ( with different values for different subjects , like english and irish ) is what got us to stop teaching our kids irish . 
  were currently trying the same tactic with leaving cert irish and maths but not as strong handedly so it 's not working . 
  it only died out truly in the late 1800s actually . 
  home rule 20 years earlier could have saved it . 
  japan does the same . 
  and japan does trains very well . 
  the road system already has so why not ? 
  then the problem might be my phrasing . 
   pro-eu content is more approved here , generally . 
  is what i was trying to say . 
  a * great * attempt at sarcasm . 
  do n't give us a bad name . 
  our lovableness comes from our ability to take a good joke . 
  he continued the joke . 
  relax . 
  it 's just an observation . 
  i 'm not suggesting those who do n't need to leave , or not be invited . 
  it 's just what seems to be more acceptable here . 
  you can like the eu without being a federalist . 
  for a lot of people i know in ireland , that 's where they draw the line . 
  i do n't think it 's a good thing to reaffirm your views all the time by being secluded but at the same time people are , if we 're being honest , biased towards certain types of news . 
  as long as they 're aware that this is a bias , there 's nothing wrong with a filter that gets them what they 're interested in . 
  just a feeling . 
  i think most people think so . 
  / r/eu is just a smaller / r/europe, 
  hmm ... / r/europe is n't for everyone in europe ... 
  it 's more for people in europe who like the eu . 
  the vast majority of israelis were born and raised in israel . 
  it 's not a new state anymore . 
  it 's around the same age as a lot of european states , and only so slightly younger . 
  regardless of history , you have as little right telling most israelis they have to leave as telling palestinians they do . 
  look up the hamas charter . 
  they did make that threat . 
  then recently after a palestinian was killed by israeli extremists ( an act which has been recognised as terrorism by israel ) hamas leadership declared every israeli a legitimate target , following up with the largest density of rockets in a long time, 
  i criticise the us completely freely when it 's apt but it 's pretty obvious that there 's no point in derailing just so you can say something `` edgy '' . 
  the us needs to watch itself in the near future but it has not earned the `` just as bad as russia '' badge , not by a long shot . 
  it 's hard to tell the difference but i 'm guessing since that was originally china it 's actually supposed to be a guandao . 
  but there are two types of right wingers !, 
  a : if not for the government stopped trying to protect and support the market everyone would have jobs !, 
  b : if people ca n't earn the vast millions i was born into it 's their own fault for being too lazy !, 
  did n't you know ? 
  everyone in the us is either rich or lazy . 
  history . 
  it 's so rich with history !, 
  i 've never been to spain and can not speak spanish or other iberian languages , but i 've always known it as zaragoza in english . 
  it * was * on `` politics.ie '' , but i do agree that it 's horrible to use this as ammunition . 
  the eurocritics are voting , we need something to convince people who see potential in the union reason to vote too . 
  i do n't know if this happened elsewhere but ireland had two other votes going on ( though only one in most places ) so we were voting either way ... 
  french immigrants would add to the `` english '' value , not the `` french '' one , because it has to be a second language , not their mother tongue . 
  a lot of us are the same in ireland . 
  i guess it 's rather common , so . 
  i knew it was familiar !, 
  0:21 -0:23 is st. patrick 's cathedral , dublin , ireland . 
  yup , fixed . 
   and then it got worse . 
  we get a lot of bad spanish tourists in ireland . 
  not because they 're spanish but , presumably , because they 're so young . 
  like large groups of early-teens seem to be the majority of spanish tourists here . 
  that was never destined to be good . 
  i remember going on a school trip to greece when i was 13 . 
  i ca n't remember , but i 'm sure we were terrible people . 
  human right to assembly and all that stuff . 
  you should be . 
  your own fault . 
  the common travel area was your idea full knowing travel would only go one way . 
  now we 've infiltrated you to a point where we can control this most prestigious of song contests , no matter how terrible of an act we put forward !, 
  seriously though , i think that 's how it works . 
  i 'm quarter english myself , actually . 
  i do n't feel any connection to the uk from my grandmother but i 'm also glad our relations are getting better . 
  i just hope it does n't come at the expense of eu relations , as it seems to occasionally . . 
  from my limited experience ( i.e. 
  things i 've heard ) , uk history classes portray uk as the sole protestant country in europe constantly fearing a unified catholic continent . 
  as wrong as i know that to be , it seems to leave a lasting impression . 
  with the younger crowd not caring about religion so much , hopefully the influence of this will fade . 
  it 's more of an impression than a reality . 
  i know my history quite well , but it comes across this way to at least some uk citizens . 
  and justified , somewhat , as the islands usually end up being the last to fall before the comeback . 
  history . 
  not saying it 's justified , but the uk has always been a loner in european history . 
  always against the continental unifiers with allies in america , russia , etc. 
  irish here . 
  fuck you . 
  joking , of course . 
  though i thought we were pretty much on the same boat ( low sense of europeanness ) . 
  does n't seem to be the case , fortunately . 
  edit : i do realise that feels very harsh , it 's just a light-hearted follow-up to your post and seems kind of ok if read together fluidly .
