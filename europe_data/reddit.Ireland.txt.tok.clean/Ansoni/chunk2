  sorry , though . 
  that 's my bad . 
  i did n't finish that comment . 
  just got the jist and moved down . 
  calling the `` liberal view '' on homosexuality  state mandated anal sex what does he expect ? 
  it 's moronic no matter what side of the discussion he is on . 
  i like to actually debate but honestly i expect no profound logic from you . 
  i mean , seriously :  i debate with everybody with a brain . 
  i hate people like you , [ ... ] unlike you , i think instead of just having feelings . 
  how can this be true when you attack homosexuality simply because  ** for me ** the gay couple symbolizes decadence and weakness it 's just a gut feeling you have . 
  just an innate prejudice you ca n't overcome with logic . 
  you dislike the idea of homosexuality and that 's enough to determine your entire stance on it . 
  do n't pretend you brought logic to this discussion because you did n't . 
  which is ok after 101 years , but not 99 ? 
  and why should a corporation have more rights than an individual ? 
  he invented it , why does it last longer just because he sold it to a company ? 
  in other countries this makes it worth less , but in the country i accused of bending to corporate pressure it makes the copyright last longer . 
  also , you do n't seem worried about one hospital try to save someone 's life indirectly because they ca n't afford the patent to a certain incision . 
  it 's all the good i can imagine coming from this . 
  think rounded edges . 
  you have a very well thought argument , i just think i have different priorities . 
  in the article : you can patent surgical methods , not just life-saving medicines , now . 
  i do n't believe the current copyright laws are actually incomplete . 
  i think they are quite ridiculous now . 
  do you think the livelihood of a person needs to be protected up to 100 years after his death ? 
   * because they both have bigger corporate lobbying than consciences * ftfw . 
  yes , that . 
  i ca n't do that . . 
  if he wants i 'm near native in japanese , but japan is n't european ... yet . 
  so do you pm people who offer ? 
  i could send one from ireland , if you like . 
  i do n't speak a `` native language '' , though . 
  i think it looks awful at the end , but fantastic until then . 
  if you watch the video , i like it until 40 seconds . 
  from then it just looks like a cluster of stalagmites . 
  i pretty much added that last comment just to make it clear that i knew you were n't supporting the poster . 
  otherwise it might have been ambiguous . 
  ( i agree with clarifying it for non-readers though ), 
  i realise northern ireland would kind of mess up the design and all , but not including it in that picture really sends a message . 
  with that in mind , i enjoyed the last one the most :p, 
  that 's not why it 's hypocritical . 
  it being hypocritical has nothing to do with the aim of the bill but with parliament members trying to portray pornography and its viewers as morally bankrupt . 
  there 's a * le * and a * les * ? 
  are they pronounced differently ? 
  getting engaged is just asking someone to marry you . 
  that 's it . 
  do you have a lot of surprise weddings in france ? 
  i feel like for the sake of my point i should emphasize that with `` in a position '' i also mean `` to the degree that they are able '' which includes both how many people it helps and how much it helps them . 
  also that ( what you said ) is a fantastic idea . 
  yeah . 
  and if a country is in a position to help people who need help , it should . 
  it was also windy that day . 
  that 's probably what happened . 
  or someone just knocked it over for a funny picture . 
  worked for me . 
  what op said . 
  ... but , ireland is included and still pure anyway . 
  our biggest earthquake knocked an ashtray over once . 
  our only casualty . 
  not only designed it but scratched it into the coin himself, 
  it should n't , because municipal waste is waste which has been discarded by the public . 
  it 's also an average , probably taken from yearly statistics . 
  it includes any electrical appliances you throw out during the year . 
  also any construction waste ( wood , dirt , paint ) . 
  it also includes things thrown out to be recycled . 
  probably dutch . 
  when a word ends with an `` e '' in portuguese it has a `` y '' sound , pronounced kinsally . 
  but dutch kinsale would sound exactly the same as japanese . 
  i know what it means but there 's the problem that all the other `` greats '' have disappeared ( from popular titles , anyway ) and a lot of people , including british people themselves , think it 's just a grandiose way of saying `` britain '' . 
  that can be problematic . 
  those are regular nouns , which is fair enough , but i do n't like english anglicising every proper noun as well . 
  names of cities and people 's names should n't need to be changed , in my opinion . 
  i think the problem is the primary maths syllabus is too simple . 
  tables for 6 years is way too long . 
  we 're kind of taught that maths is being able to add and subtract , multiply and divide and we 're only taught it 's real problem solving value when we go into first year . 
  not only is it a late start , but i blame it for the `` wtf , this is n't maths , it 's letters and shit . 
  never using this '' mindset of the people who find ordinary level difficult . 
  i do n't think it 's massive ; i think the ordinary level is just too easy . 
  so it 's well worth going to lax route before the bonus points were introduced . 
  do n't mean to be rude or anything , but should n't you be telling us ? 
  well , i kind of do n't want to push it , but that never actually came into it . 
  he admitted the republic 's population is close to 5 million , but the actual statement he argued was  only some 4,600,000 are ** irish ** which is ambiguous . 
  i understand and have no issues with ni being part of the uk , but there is no demonym for the uk and whether or not the people of northern ireland should be called irish/northern irish/british is usually left to personal preference . 
  and he said  wonder how northern irish should be counted admitting he was n't sure . 
  while i overall disagree with his stance he has a point here because people in northern ireland can vote for our president so he technically represents some of them , too . 
  still , 100 % should have been specified . 
  19/21 in ireland today . 
  i actually went for a walk . 
  you can all have it back , it 's messing with my head . 
  except you 'll actually use the 5 cent . 
  you do n't need to throw them out . 
  in fact , you can now ask your friends for them . 
  they already reduce everything to .99 , this would just have them put it back up . 
  in my mind , it 's an improvement for both parties . 
  i hated that that was the first qualifier for best country . 
  if it was personal freedoms i would n't have cared . 
  ideally it should say civil liberties , i think . 
  so what *** i *** take from your response is that you 're going to contrast the american and non-american responses to show something about americans ... ? 
  better than `` britain 's british broadcasting corporation . '', 
  any language .
