  there are call centres here for japanese and korean companies . 
  so many , too . 
  not asking as much as overstating the point . 
  i just feel it needs to be overstated . 
   we do n't actually have an adjective for citizen of the uk apart from british . 
  honest question : how can people complain about the uk being called britain when the official demonym for people in northern ireland is `` british '' ? 
   i suppose the secular people might believe it 's a historical right . 
  that . 
  mostly that . 
  some also just believed they had a right ( or just a need ) as a homeless ethnic group to a homeland . 
   this is clearly not the most common interpretation . 
  no , but thousands were ready to accept japan 's offer for a jewish state to be made out of machuria . 
  not necessarily , as secular jews and non-jews can be zionists as well . 
  and there are branches that do n't believe israel needed to be in the location it is but rather just that there be a country for the ethnic group . 
  99 % sure it was a typo . 
  keyboard positions and all . 
  kaliningrad oblast ( the green above poland ) is a russian exclave ( part of russia ) and should be coloured the same grey as russia is . 
  just some uncommon knowledge for those interested . 
  maybe we can provide an answer for you once you unload that question . 
  did america join the uk in the fight against napoleon ~ 30 years after independence ? 
  i wonder why . 
    i did n't say anything about americans , but about the us . 
   you did actually . 
  no , he did n't . 
   * everything else you said . 
  * grow up . 
  this is n't about you or your dad . 
  sounds like he does deserve healthcare but it 's not about him . 
  this is about protecting society . 
  in one sense because rehabilitation works better than revenge . 
  and in another , protecting society from itself becoming one that condones slavery and torture . 
  a scumbag is still a human . 
  yes , what they did is terrible but terribleness is n't a good solution for terribleness . 
   most are *** addicted *** to the feeling of control it gives them . 
  others *** ca n't get off *** without the feeling they are hurting someone . 
  seemed like you needed the emphasis . 
  this person has a problem that can be fixed . 
  maybe everyone ca n't be fixed but does that mean we should never try ? 
  just pile punishments onto people until they feel like monsters . 
  but go on . 
  keep telling them they 're monsters . 
  when they listen and abandon the humanity they have left you should know you 've only made it worse . 
  child molesters are human . 
  calling them monsters does nothing to stop them . 
  there 's no level of criminal where the criminal stops being a human . 
  that 's where our legal systems seem to disagree . 
   successive and consecutive they work almost exactly the same but there are minor differences . 
  successive sequences generally must form a series while consecutive ones can happen randomly . 
  consider the term succeed . 
  there is intention behind succeeding something/someone . 
   no , i mean that a `` z '' symbol shows up in the pronunciation guide for each just like my three examples . 
  most words that end in 's ' , including those where the 's ' is follow by a silent vowel , use a ` z ' sound . 
  so this is hardly one of english 's worst spelling rules . 
  you claim - ise is n't `` phonetic '' , by which of course you mean that it 's ` z ' sound and should be spelled with a ` z ' , yes ? 
  but is 's ' really not acceptable for this pronunciation ? 
  rhymes , flies , drives . 
  they 're all '' ` z ' sounds '' spelt with an 's ' . 
  ah sure ... 
  a lot of the big tech giants do business all around the world through ireland . 
  i do n't know how the loopholes work , but i still do n't agree with them . 
  and what about the jobs they bring in ? 
  well paid but very few in number and i know a * tonne * of continental europeans who came to work those jobs . 
  not a `` der stealin ' our jobs ! '', 
  complaint , but more of a `` are we really benefiting from this ? '', 
  question . 
  we did until 1993 . 
  you 've only one year to go before gay marriage !, 
  good going !, 
  they had permission . 
  usually . 
  he is a very popular historical figure in europe and was extremely popular in turkey until recently . 
  he founded the modern turkish state from the ruins of the ottoman empire and ( heavily opinion from here ) made it into the most advanced and prosperous islamic majority state of the time . 
  erdogan is currently trying to undo his progress . 
  sounds like a race to the bottom to me . 
  our political system is too corrupt ? 
  let 's give all the power to the market leaders . 
  i wish japan was in the eurovision ... 
  japan would make a great edition . 
  there is a lot of articles about it . 
  ca n't remember the contents but they seemed to really push the idea . 
  yes . 
  the ones who want to unite with ireland are nationalists and the ones who want to stay with their current nation are unionists . 
  not confusing at all . 
  not helping . 
  the source is old and i agree the old ones are grey but i 'd much sooner call the new ones green ( though they 're really neither ), 
  i guess the kiddie porn sites they use would be off the radar and not affected by the ban . 
  yeah . 
  and countries like denmark who allow people their basic rights are the ones that are defending them . 
  you 're right . 
  they did n't say `` we will spend it '' but they intentionally said it in a way that made the population think they would . 
  do you really think that 's okay ? 
  no one is saying 52 % of the population was cheated . 
  but 5 % of that 52 ? 
  probably . 
  ireland is absolutely in the anglosphere . 
  not all 52 % , of course . 
  that would be ridiculous . 
  ( though i 'm intrigued to know what percentage you think it is , as you did say `` actions of the few '' ) but let 's go back a few comments . 
  lowendlevono accuses europeans of hating brits based on a small number of the pro-eu commenters on / r/europe regarding brexit . 
  you took his side .
