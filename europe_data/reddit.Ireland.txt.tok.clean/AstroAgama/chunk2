  ( i 'm pretty sure it is here ), 
  its not hypocritical to oppose the death penalty today and celebrate this . 
  i 'm not christian but i celebrate christmas . 
  i agree there needs to be more distinction but there has to be a certain degree of responsibility on the people . 
  in fairness , ireland isnt energy dependant on russia . 
  there are signs for that in tv studios , but it is n't common in debates and panel discussions . 
  honestly , crimea kinda feels like tibet all over again . 
  it 's also slightly annoying because podcasts tend to n quieter than music . 
  when i say ireland i mean the republic . 
  right , but if the taoiseach ca n't afford a surrogate nobody cant, 
  ivf is a thing . 
  ireland 's pretty boring . 
  ireland has only been historically dominated . 
  things have shifted and now the two largest party only have 50 % together . 
  that 's what makes stv so good . 
  in the long run it moves away from two party systems . 
  also ireland has a huge independent representative . 
  this map is confusing . 
  is it only including the red part from germany to italy ? 
  i thought it was bigger than that . 
  or is it including everything ? 
  right . 
  and voting for the left does n't mean i support open borders . 
  ireland is top 10 !, 
  hopefully brexit does n't hurt this . 
  eh , i dont know . 
  lesbian porn is nothing close to how a woman would pleasure herself . 
  it 's the colour of our presidential flag . 
  you left out the quote where she said this is a direct result of trumps visit . 
  the irish national anthem mentions english people if that counts . 
  ** see in the east a silv ' ry glow ** ** out yonder waits the saxon foe **, 
  whats the overlap betweeb lib dems and tories ? 
  does that count though ? 
  what actual interaction did she have with the faith ? 
  did she even read a quran ? 
  feels more she given an excuse to do what she wanted . 
  well he had a surprising depth in his voice , and it 's was just my style . 
  also he was adorable . 
  aw , i really liked the bulgarian kid . 
  the portugal guy just seemed arrogant . 
  oh somebodys got their knickers in a bunch . 
  but are they are unified movement in the same way labour was . 
  i mean ireland only got a social democrats party a year ago . 
  it 's funny , in ireland the labour party ( no actual connections with the british one ) has also collapsed but the left had grown while the centre shrinks . 
  it 's slow though , but maybe that means it 's more concrete . 
  is n't it more roman empire unity ? 
  and why places like ireland diverge ? 
  bar the fact that the campaign ca n't respond i ca n't help but feel releasing them now is because there 's nothing in them but they want the spectre of doubt . 
  problem is moderates would choose shadowy macron over fascist le pen . 
  eh , yeah based on his foreign policies i do n't think that will ever be the case . 
  you ca n't this is the norm and the last was the outlier from the same poll just cause you disagree . 
  look i 'm not gon na get into the ranking of what 's worse cancer or aids i 'm just saying sexuality cleansing is n't far from ethnic cleansing but at least it was n't parents murdering their children ( or at least i hope ), 
  concentration camps plus getting family members to kill each other ? 
  language is strongly connected to nationhood . 
  it 's often used as the justification of independence between countries and is a nationalist system believed the contain its own system of thought , values and culture . 
  the french language ( like many non-english eu languages ) is being spoken by fewer and less often . 
  therefore say ving it is to save france in a sense . 
  ( although that does n't get into the fact you can really will a language to existence but that 's a larger discussion ), 
  its up there . 
  so it seems le pen mumbles her way through for 90 % and then spends the last 10 % on a prepared attack on macron . 
  is this translator bad or does le pen have no idea what her next word is going to be at any given time ? 
  ireland 's still mostly boring . 
  also the population only has each other , the diaspora does n't have to be with each other . 
  ireland 's in the middle of a pretty bad housing crisis and we still havent made a full cultural shift to apartments . 
  whats attractive to the individual today to this though ? 
  they look like pawns and have given up their own identity . 
  i still have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  i responded to your point by pointing out that while both the candidate have unpopular mentors that has little correlation with their own popularity . 
  and now you 're going off on a speech about trump for some reason . 
  the us ? 
  what , i do n't what you 're talking about ? 
  you 're just making vague general statements . 
  i meant matter in terms of hurting their support . 
  and le pen is the heir of her father who is actively supporting her and was n't very well liked . 
  it 's almost like that does n't matter . 
  he worked in the financial sector , and is likeable . 
  anything else ? 
  considering where it is geographically thats better than it sounds . 
  now if only it could be more free . 
  reports say that brexit has done a lot for internal communication and working together . 
  let 's hope . 
  pretty sure most arent serious . 
  like 54 % of irish , c'mon . 
  dustin is basically our big bird . 
  except his a crass city boy with an attitude . 
  he 's great . 
  but there have been tons of generation born by the easy going into bad shit . 
  that 's not actually true though right ? 
  maybe because most of the people in a european subreddit are in the eu ? 
  roscommon no . 
  leitrim on the other hand ... 
  that wo n't be a problem is the tories have majority rule though . 
  another election would result in the same outcome . 
  maybe sinn fein and dup do better and the smaller parties do worse . 
  thats not going to fix anything . 
  politically its a partisan stalemate . 
  but should a border poll in northern ireland or a second reference in scotland occur we both know that 's not how may will handle it . 
  it will be an economic message to keep away choas . 
  that 's why i think even if these issues fail they are n't going away . 
  people are making their decisions but the pro-uk side is desperately lacking in a passionate argument .
