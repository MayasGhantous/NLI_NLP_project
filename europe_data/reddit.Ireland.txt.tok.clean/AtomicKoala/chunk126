  edit : efficient does n't necessarily mean best , of course . 
  edit : sozzlepops for my misinterpretation , uat2d . 
  does the valencian government have powers to levy emergency taxes ? 
  they can not simply leave citizens without healthcare like this . 
  double ? 
  thats ... mental . 
  we are talking $ 9-10 billion off the estimates . 
  ca n't it be a democratic federation , a republic in all but name , and keep the monarchs of individual states ? 
  i see no reason why we could not keep our own little royal families , and still have a republic at the european level . 
  of course , we could also do what malaysia do and have a rotating monarchy , where the monarchies of individual states elect one of themselves to be the the king of malaysia for five years . 
  the two states without a constitutional monarchy play no part in this , however . 
  anyway , the idea of a european federation meaning that constitutional monarchies must disappear in individual states is , in my opinion , a massive intrusion into the rights of individual nations , and one that a european government has no business getting involved with . 
  the idea of the uk leaving the eu is kinda scary for me . 
  our biggest trading partner leaving the union would have disastrous effects on much of the economy . 
  the uk economy would go to shit , and drag us down too . 
  furthermore , it could really effect northern ireland , which right now is reliant on uk and eu money to keep it stable . 
  it would put paid to any notion of unification , and the troubles could flair back up again . 
  i want to say , `` fuck them , leave them enjoy their mess if they leave '' . 
  but in all truth , i ca n't . 
  the uk joined with us , and if they leave , they could force us out too , and send both of us back decades , economically and socially . 
  * ** ` murrica **, 
  i think a lot of these downvotes are actually because this smujal guy spams this subreddit with pro-catalan independence articles , and nothing else . 
  it * is * a bit annoying to be fair . 
  ` hon the balearic islands . 
  miles is more a figure of speech these days * in ireland * , however in the uk road speeds are still marked in miles . 
  as for as measuring height and weight , lots of people , especially those who do sports , know their measurements in metric , in the british isles . 
  as long as people know both there should n't be a big problem . 
  edit : i 'm not saying metric natives should know both , just us imperialites . 
  and the the fact the uk stays out of schengen means ireland effectively cant join either . 
  i feel really guilty how everyone else learns english , it makes things so convenient ( for me ) as for irish . . well its kinda dead anyway . 
  people do speak it , and it is nice to have the * c\u00fapla focal * , but well , it 's not useful . 
  there will always be thousands of people who will keep it up anyway , ca n't say i feel much duty to myself . 
  northern ireland has 18 seats in westminster , and sinn f\u00e9in contest these seats . 
  historically ( a hundred years ago ) , the idea is that having dozens of absent mps would force parliament to grant ireland home rule . 
  that point is pretty moot now though , sf should take their seats in london or give back the money they take from taxpayers . 
  hey , i bitch about it all the time . 
   effectively every 70 year-old brit effectively fought on the side of nazi germany haha , brilliant !, 
  well , this is more an issue with single seat constituencies . 
  proportional representation is the way to go - even if it lets less savoury types get seats , it 's a lot fairer and prevents a two-party system . 
  why cant we have a combination of both ? 
  this is in reality what most european countries do . 
  these things really do n't appeal to me . 
  that said , i know a lot of people who have gone to vegas and really enjoyed themselves , so perhaps it would not be so bad to have one in europe and keep the money and tourists here ? 
  edit : that said ...  `` las vegas has more corruption and prostitution than anywhere else , '' pereda said . 
  `` and they want to bring that here ? 
  and the guy behind this , what 's his name , he 's been implicated in money laundering for thugs and assassins . ''  actually , not adeleson himself , but some top sands executives are under investigation , suspected of laundering money for mexican drug cartels . 
   critics of euro-vegas recognize that spaniards need jobs , but they say they should n't come at any expense . 
  local anti-casino campaigner juan garcia says spain will have to bend too many rules to accommodate adelson 's wishes . 
   `` adelson wants to let tobacco in other words get an exemption from spain 's anti-smoking laws -- and keep workers unions out , '' garcia said . 
  these things are bad . 
   the document also calls for a new european police organisation to guard the union 's external borders, 
   is eu becoming a irrelevant & heavily indebted 3rd world shithole at the same pace as usa or even faster ? 
  uncle fran\u00e7ois sounds really homely ... although i do already have an uncle philippe . 
   i suppose now we just have to treat europe as our country and parliament as the only important one , independence is dying . 
  i do n't know how i feel about it , i hoped for a confederacy . 
  no we do n't have to treat it as the only important government , just an important government . 
  our own national and regional/state governments still are , and will be in full control of the everyday things that effect all of us ; healthcare , education , taxes , justice , welfare , etc. 
  even with the fullest implementation of these proposals , european level spending would only be a single digit percentage of overall government spending . 
  i think kosovo is completely lost to serbia ... they shall have to move on , i am afraid . 
  i would think and hope that every member state would still certainly want an external affairs ministry - to deal with the european government , and for things outside of europe . 
  well , austria , finland , sweden , and ireland are all outside nato and claim to be neutral . 
  certainly sweden has the capability to defend itself , and austria and finland also , but without a strong associated military industry . 
  as for ireland , we maintain so small and ill-equipped an army that we basically rely on the uk as our deterrent . 
  well , lots of people would be aghast at the creation of a federal europe . 
  but lots would not either . 
  and i would support the federation of europe . 
  well , i would hope that if the falklands were ever attacked again ( or any eu member 's external territory ) , that there would be planes and ships from all over europe right next to british ( or whatever attacked parties ) ones . 
  as for getting unanimous decision , ireland or whatever country being a gobshite could easily prevent such a deployment , and i would not want my 1 % of europe making europeans less safe . 
  i think that no country that is in the eu is actually neutral . 
  ireland for example , will always support europe over russia . 
  lets not beat around the bush here , we are a small country and not in nato , but neutral ? 
  lies from politicians to appease the populace . 
  the thing is , the said reviling video is so crude and awful that it discredits the islamaphobe cause , and if the muslims who are angry would calm down , actually bolster the concept that islam isnt worse than christianity or judaism . 
   for example , maltese is official in the eu but catalan , spoken by millions more people , is not , because spain does n't want it to be . 
  i have a massive issue with this . 
  * irish * is an official eu language , yet catalan , which has far more reason to be official , isnt . 
  absolute bullshit . 
  its odd that ukraine and belarus are included when russia is n't . 
  they are all just as ( ir ) relevant as each other in stuff like this . 
   we still have parents in the east who refuse to send their kids to school , forced marriages , honor killings . 
  i would think that this is an issue with kurdish culture more than anything , sadly . 
  important bits :  five of the six biggest countries in the eu , excluding britain , have called for a radical overhaul of european foreign and defence policies to create a powerful new pan - ** european foreign ministry ** , majority voting on common foreign policies to bypass a british veto , a ** possible european army ** , and a single market for eu defence industries . 
   the german-led push , supported by 11 of 27 eu countries , embraces recent calls in berlin and brussels for a directly elected european president , sweeping new powers for the european parliament , and further splitting of the eu by creating a new ** parliamentary sub-chamber for the 17 countries of the eurozone ** . 
  -  `` aim for a european defence policy with joint efforts regarding the defence industry ( eg the creation of a single market for armament projects ) ; for some members of the group this could eventually involve a european army . '', 
   the backers include germany , france , italy , spain and poland , five of the six biggest eu countries omitting britain . 
  the netherlands , belgium , denmark , austria , portugal and luxembourg also signed up . 
   the recommendations include more incendiary steps , including ** a proposal to re-open and change european treaties by majority voting ** because getting consensus in a union of 27 or 28 has become too slow , acrimonious and unwieldy . 
  edit : [ report link ] ( http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0cc0qfjab&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msz.gov.pl%2ffiles%2fdocs%2fkomunikaty%2f20120918raport%2freport.pdf&amp;ei=3k5yuo3baotchaefmyc4ba&amp;usg=afqjcnfelwbk30nlfvgsx2wg35b7epcteq&amp;sig2=9lo4veqiufyhn1m7jumnbg ) this could be a game-changer for europe . 
  [ they had their referendum . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_general_election,_2011 ) i 'm sorry but , representative democracy . 
  they shall have another referendum in four or less years . 
   the lowest shares of students studying a foreign language were found in the united kingdom ( 32 % ) and ireland ( 58 % ) . 
  this quite disappointing , and i 'm slightly surprised . 
  everyone i know is studying a foreign language in second-level , i would have put the irish number at 80 or so percent . 
  then again , probably just where i live . 
  learning irish really does n't help though , its compulsory so one can not simply drop it to learn an additional foreign language , as they are already effectively learning two . 
  ah of course , just saying that you should n't feel bad , 
  thats not representative of romanians , just roma . 
  besides , i 'm pretty sure most europeans know how to dodge roma now . 
  the nice thing about selling them to egypt is that , egypt will use them as a deterrent while israel would be as likely to use them for war .
