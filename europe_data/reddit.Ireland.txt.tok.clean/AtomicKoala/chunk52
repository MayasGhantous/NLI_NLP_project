  france and germany publicly opposing turkey 's entry has only made it harder for turkey , as its people are thus inclined to look away from europe . 
  real genuine efforts have to be made by both sides . 
  its too early to know that . 
  i 'm sure people said the same when portugal made its transition to democracy . 
  people will learn from their mistakes in a democracy , at least . 
  do n't count on the muslim brotherhood governing egypt in a decade . 
  the people in libya who overwhelming supported the overthrow of gadaffi ? 
  the people of egypt who , not quite as overwhelmingly , wanted to see democracy ? 
  i 'm not sure of the relevance . 
  the taliban were far worse than gadaffi or mubarak to their people . 
  afghanistan is also a country with almost no development , unlike libya or egypt . 
  the nato intervention in libya was limited . 
  libyans did most of the work . 
  one needs only look at how quickly gadaffi lost tripoli . 
  did nato agents help on the ground ? 
  yes . 
  did they fight ? 
  not in any meaningful way . 
  what nato did was speed up gadaffis overthrow and prevent a stalemate . 
  intervention is sometimes necessary you know . 
  ah god now ... 
  more importantly , what is a mile ?!, 
  tell that to those who fell under taliban rule as the northern alliance were pushed back . 
  why ? 
  i think in a few hundred years it would be nice to see some sort of lose democratic federation , but thats far far away . 
  i doubt europe could handle having half the voting power of africa or india . 
  its really important to point out that this is only when the mother 's life - ** not health ** , is at risk . 
  we still have so far too go . 
  well , when you consider that france has a lower deficit , and is far closer to closing it , and isnt heavily dependent on a dodgy financial sector , i would say france is doing better . 
  france needs a good bit of structural reforms , cant get my head around the idea of retiring at 60 , when life expectancies indicate at least 18 years of retirement for most . 
  please ... make it stop ... 
   think of an election as picking the way you 'd like to be governed , not picking what you 'd like your government to do . 
  this . 
  this this this . 
  if the government did what we wanted them to do , taxes would be at 20 % of gdp , and spending at 50 % . 
  we should elect politicians to run the country in a certain way , not to just give us things . 
  sure that was the motto we had for the lisbon treaty referendum . 
  we got stability at least , 33 % is better than 0 !, 
  i know some of these words ... 
  apples debacle with their own new mapping app may just have made it so , by default . 
  remember google maps were default up to ios5 . 
  there 's more elections than just the presidential election , though . 
  i know that france uses nuclear as its main source of electricity - i think europe in its entirety must do the same . 
  indeed , thanks for the alert . 
  time to go to bed methinks . 
   the eu is becoming the eussr : dictatorial : greedy : corrupt it always amuses me how the eu is a socialist construction from one perspective , and a neoliberal cesspit from another . 
   europe is ` for life ' not just for christmas . 
  france shows us that it is possible to have an economy with plenty of heavy industry , that is not necessarily heavy on carbon emissions . 
  that said , france has massive work to do on emissions , however the task for other european countries is even more burdensome . 
  we can contribute a lot - by leading , and helping other countries reduce their emissions . 
  oh medication is very important . 
  i was dismissing deusdies ' opinion . 
  be [ le ] rus . 
  thought that might amuse you . 
  did n't realise he was working for the spanish secret service . 
  as for the rest , it should come of a shock to no one that it was russia who murdered him . 
  horrible death , remember seeing pictures of the man on tv . 
  i think germany has made some progress in recent years . 
  as i said when i noted it , i was pleasantly surprised to see that they did not vote against against the palestinian statehood vote in the un . 
  a long way to go yet , but yeah . 
  as for people seeing them as nazis for imposing austerity , thats a view light on thought . 
  very little of that kind of notionary around in ireland anyway , and we arent famed for being the most politically astute . 
   and this is exactly the problem ** a decent number ** with muslim immigrants . 
  fixed that for you . 
  yeah , i always find it ironic when people go on about ( very real ) structural problems in the french economy , while the uk economy gets ignored , with its massive deficit and dependence on a very dodgy banking industry that helped bring the global economy to its knees . 
  i think that a number of seats in parliament should be decided by a series of brawls in the chamber . 
  would certainly increase public interest in politics . 
  plenty of europeans have those issues too . 
  and one can do perfectly well with them , given support and proper diagnosis . 
  there is one crucial issue with unification - economics . 
  northern ireland as an independent country would be surpassed by a lot of post communist european countries , and massive austerity would be required . 
  united with ireland , it would cost us in the south thousands of euros per capita to keep them afloat . 
  a lot of economic cost for what many see as a troublesome country . 
  for the next decade or two at least its best they remain in the uk . 
  the economic cost is at least spread over 15 times as many people there . 
  nationalists see this too , most want to remain in the uk . 
  the uk government is fair , certainly these days , and i think a lot of nationalists see the sense in staying put . 
  edit : i should have clarified about the economic situation - northern ireland is massively subsidised by british taxpayers . 
  the standard of living is thus not as low as it would be otherwise , and indeed is better off in many respects than the republic . 
  can i be pedantic for a second ? 
  they are voting for his party , of which he is the leader , with the intention of having him become prime minister . 
  they are not electing him to the non executive post of president . 
  but yeah , fuck berlusconi and his ilk . 
  i hope thats a sentiment most can agree with . 
  cork/limerick ( or much of munster , whatever definition you want ) , has quite a high gdp/capita too , just saying . 
  ^ ^ ... might ^ ^ be ^ ^ from ^ ^ cork, 
   edit2 : a [ 2 ] shit storm is coming !, 
  http://www.novinite.com/media/images/2012-12/photo_verybig_145937.jpg must say that our enda is looking well . 
  what war was that ? 
  serbia ? 
  libya ? 
  yes , lets promote peace in the world by letting governments kill thousands of people , and allowing terrible wars to rumble on . 
  if you are on about iraq , only a handful of eu nations joined that , while many strongly opposed it . 
  no bother , i 'll take it off your hands !, 
  sure couldnt they just take turns like they do in malaysia . 
  liz can call first dibs . 
  complete with a halo of yellow stars of course . 
  i 'll give you whitaker and the literary lads . 
  would n't like to see the rest on my notes . 
  people should be on notes due to their positive contribution to society ( eg scientists , philosophers , etc ) , not because of historical significance for better or worse imo .
