ah , es como `` what planet are you on ? '', 
  should be interesting to see how this plays out over the next few months . 
  yes . 
  this comes up frequently when one of these european language maps is posted . 
  had they used census data for ireland as they 've done for wales , most of it would be green . 
  * [ proportion of respondents who said they could speak welsh in the 2011 census ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ektfunr.jpg ) * [ proportion of respondents who said they could speak irish in the 2011 census ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vqy4gk0.jpg ) `` who said they could speak '' is n't the same as what is actually spoken natively in these regions . 
  there 's no evidence they were used for defence . 
  the majority of them were built during early christian ireland when monasteries were flourishing , long before the vikings were a threat . 
  they were also badly located for defence , e.g in valleys ( glendalough ) or open plains ( monasterboice ) . 
  this would suggest that they were built for religious purposes . 
  the towers were generally built with very little foundation . 
  building the door at ground level would weaken the tower . 
  instead , the section of the tower underneath the entrance was packed with soil and stones . 
  that was the foundation . 
  do a search on google books for irish round towers , there 's loads of research there . 
   are you from clondalkin , op ? 
  n\u00ed hea , but i was reading the clondalkin wiki and completely forgot that dublin had its very own irish round tower still perfectly intact . 
  deadly . 
  scattered across ireland are the remains of 65 irish round towers ( irish : * cloigtheach * meaning `` bell house '' ) . 
  indeed , they are known as `` irish '' , for they are believed to be an almost exclusively irish phenomenon . 
  soaring as high as 34 meters above the ground , the towers are in remarkably fine condition considering the antiquity of their construction . 
  every tower is at the site of a known celtic church dating from the 5th to 12th centuries . 
  the structures still stand today because their round shape is gale-resistant and the section of the tower underneath the entrance is packed with soil and stones . 
  the lower portion is solid masonry with a single door raised two to three metres above , often accessible only by a ladder . 
  the main reason for the entrance-way being built above ground level was to maintain the structural integrity of the building . 
  about 120 examples are thought once to have existed ; most are in ruins , while around twenty are in almost perfect condition .

   the ** national day of catalonia ** is a day-long festival in catalonia . 
  it commemorates the defeat of catalonia during the war of the spanish succession . 
  the catalan troops that initially fought in support of the habsburg dynasty 's claim to the spanish throne were finally defeated at the siege of barcelona by the army of the borbon king philip v of spain on 11 september 1714 after 14 months of siege . 
  that meant the loss of the catalan constitutions under the aegis of the nueva planta decrees . 
  the holiday was first celebrated in 11 september 1886 , was suppressed by the franco dictatorship in 1939 and reinstated in 1980 by the autonomous government of catalonia . 
   independentist organizations and political parties traditionally lay floral offerings at the monuments of the leaders of the defence of the city rafael casanova and general moragues for their fight against the king philip v of spain . 
  typically , catalan nationalists organize demonstrations and meet at the fossar de les moreres of barcelona , where they pay homage to the defenders of city who died during the siege and were buried there . 
  throughout the day , there are independentist demonstrations and cultural events in most of catalan villages and many citizens wave senyeres and estelades . 
  just copied this off wikipedia , not sure how accurate it is . 
  maybe some catalans can pipe in . 
   right under that foreign island .

  my response on / r/mapporn seeing as it shows basque and catalan , i 'd be nice to see the other minority languages as well ( see [ this map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/germany_name_european_languages.svg/2000px-germany_name_european_languages.svg.png ) ) in irish , there is no simple word for `` i '' . 
  * water is * *** at me *** * is maith ** liom ** uisce -- ( ** i ** like water ) lit . 
  * water is good * *** with me *** * t\u00e1 uisce ** uaim ** -- ( ** i ** want water ) lit . 
  * water is away * *** from me *** * is eol ** dom ** -- ( ** i ** know ) lit : * is known * *** to me *** * t\u00e1 ocras ** orm ** -- ( ** i ** am hungry ) lit . 
  * hunger is * *** on me *** * t\u00e1 ruathar ** f\u00fam ** -- ( ** i ** am in a rush ) lit . 
  * attack is * *** under me *** * n\u00edl ** ionam ** bogadh -- ( ** i ** ca n't move ) lit . 
  * is not * *** in me *** * to move *, 
   there 's nothing `` draconian '' about this . 
  as others have said , you are absolutely incorrect . 
   en : ** draconian ** : * draconian laws , government actions , etc. 
  are extremely severe , or go further than what is right or necessary * ^ [ 1 ] ( http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/draconian )  es : ** draconiano ** : * excesivamente severo o muy r\u00edgido * ( excessivly severe or very rigid ) ^ [ 2 ] ( http://www.wordreference.com/definicion/draconiano )  fr : ** draconien ** : * d'une rigueur excessive , rigoureux , inexorable * ( excessive strictness , rigorous , relentless ) ^ [ 3 ] ( http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/draconien_draconienne/26694 ), 
  from an irish perspective , * fecking * is a benign expression that does n't have the same meaning as * fucking * . 
  as i was pretending to convey genuine aggression in my comment , i used * fucking * . 
  the comic uses * feck off * as it 's just in jest . 
  if it said * fuck off * it would be more aggressive and the comic would lose its playful irish connotation . 
  = in jest : `` ah sure , are n't ye silly altogether ! '', 
  * you fucking idiot = serious : you actually fucked up .

  it should be * fisting * . 
   ** man fined $ 300 for saying `` mate '' to a police officer **  a malaga local received a $ 300 fine for using the word `` mate '' to address a police officer . 
   he was charged under spain 's controversial gag law for * `` lack of respect and consideration provided to a member of the security forces in the performance of their duties to protect the safety '' * . 
   under the new law , citizens can be fined up to $ 600 for insulting or disrespecting an officer , over $ 30,000 for recording and disseminating images of police officers , and more than $ 600,000 for participating in an unauthorized protest outside government buildings . 
   the new law , approved by the governing right-wing partido popular led by prime minister mariano rajoy , is seen as a threat to basic human rights such as the freedoms of expression and assembly . 
   all opposition parties have already said they will void the law if they reach a majority in the spanish general election later this year . 
  * colega * literally means * colleague * , but colloquially it means * mate , pal , buddy , friend * . 
  a perfectly harmless word but obviously not respectful enough for the spanish ~ ~ gestapo ~ ~ police . 
  [ more about the gag law ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/06/30/inenglish/1435681072_581012.html ), 
  that 's true for a lot of languages . 
  spanish has * adios * ( to god ) , * ojal\u00e1 * ( allah willing ) . 
  english has * goodbye * ( god be with ye ) . 
  when irish speakers say * dia duit * for hello , they are n't literally wishing that god be with you . 
  the religious connotation has faded over time . 
  here are all the irish days : * * d\u00e9 luain * - day of the moon * * d\u00e9 m\u00e1irt * - day of mars * * d\u00e9 c\u00e9adaoin * - day of first fasting * * d\u00e9ardaoin * - day of middle fasting * * d\u00e9 haoine * - day of the fasting * * d\u00e9 sathairn * - day of saturn * * d\u00e9 domhnaigh * - day of the lord, 
  strawberry fields forever ? 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/opinion/spains-ominous-gag-law.html  the gag law would define public protest in front of parliament and other government buildings as a `` disturbance of public safety '' punishable by a fine of 30,000 euros . 
  people who join in spontaneous protests near utilities , transportation hubs , nuclear power plants or similar facilities would risk a jaw-dropping fine of $ 600,000 . 
   the `` unauthorized use '' of images of law enforcement authorities or police -- presumably aimed at photojournalists or ordinary citizens with cameras taking pictures of cops or soldiers -- would also draw a $ 30,000 fine , making it hard to document abuses . 
   the law 's main purpose , it appears , is to help the ruling party maintain its hold on power by discouraging the anti-austerity protests that have snowballed into widespread support for the populist podemos party . 
  podemos looks set to make major gains in elections this year . 
  the new law will allow the restriction of [ incriminating videos like these ] ( https://youtu.be/9zjcguu5mte?t=86 ) . 
  a scary precedent indeed .

  that 's not just the czech republic though in fairness .
