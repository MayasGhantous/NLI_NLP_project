   the ** european extremely large telescope ** ( e-elt ) is a ground-based extremely large telescope for the optical/near-infrared range , currently being built by the european southern observatory ( eso ) on top of cerro armazones in the atacama desert of northern chile . 
   construction work on the e-elt site started in june 2014 . 
  in december 2014 eso had secured over 90 % funding and authorized to start construction of the telescope , which will cost around one billion euros for the first construction phase .

   one idea put forward by rajoy is to turn spanish clocks back one hour from central european time , and to align the country with portugal , the uk and ireland . 
  this would in fact be a return to the status quo before 1942 when the country 's dictator , francisco franco , moved the clocks forward as a gesture of allegiance to hitler til .

  * anyone up for a sunday history lesson ? 
  i 've cobbled this together from some of my own posts in r/history . 
  um , i 'll try to keep this as clear and concise as possible . . * ** [ gallery of the 1916 rebellion ] ( http://imgur.com/a/3zp1h ) ** the irish rebellion of 1916 , also known as the * [ easter rising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/easter_rising ) * , was an armed insurrection centred in dublin with the aim of overthrowing british rule and igniting a revolution throughout ireland . 
  the two-week battle saw the heart of dublin city destroyed by british artillery and ended with the capture and execution of the irish leaders . 
  this marked the beginning of the [ irish revolutionary period ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_revolutionary_period ) ( 1916-1922 ) and the [ irish war of independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_war_of_independence ) , during which time the british administration collapsed throughout most of ireland , paving the way for an independent irish republic . 
  ** [ pic : results of the 1918 general election ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8mxfrsm.jpg ) ** in the aftermath of the [ irish general election , 1918 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_general_election,_1918 ) , sinn f\u00e9in 's elected members refused to attend the british parliament in westminster and instead formed a new parliament in dublin , [ d\u00e1il \u00c9ireann ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%c3%a1il_%c3%89ireann ) ( `` assembly of ireland '' ) , which [ declared irish independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_declaration_of_independence ) as a republic . 
  the ensuing [ irish war of independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_war_of_independence ) was conducted under this revolutionary government who sought international recognition and set about the process of state-building . 
  in response , the british government outlawed sinn f\u00e9in and the new irish parliament ( d\u00e1il \u00c9ireann ) , and the conflict intensified thereafter . 
  over the next two years , the irish republican army ( ira ) , recognised as the legitimate army of d\u00e1il \u00c9ireann , ambushed british army patrols , attacking their barracks and forcing isolated barracks to be abandoned . 
  ** [ timeline : collapse of the british administration in ireland ( 1919 -- 1921 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_the_irish_war_of_independence ) ** in april 1920 , 400 [ ric ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_irish_constabulary ) barracks ( british police force in ireland ) were burned to the ground by the ira , along with almost one hundred income tax offices and key administrative buildings . 
  as a result , the british inland revenue ceased to operate and the british criminal courts system collapsed throughout most of the country . 
  trials by jury could not be held because jurors would not attend . 
  the ric withdrew from much of the south and west of ireland , leaving it in the control of the ira . 
  the [ irish republican police ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_republican_police ) ( irp ) was founded under the authority [ d\u00e1il \u00c9ireann ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%c3%a1il_%c3%89ireann ) to enforce the ruling of the d\u00e1il courts , set up under the irish republic . 
  civilians were encouraged to subscribe to the national loan , which was set up to raise funds for the new irish government and its army . 
  taxes were paid to local councils controlled by sinn f\u00e9in , who naturally refused to pass them on to the british government . 
  thus , by mid-1920 , the irish republic was a reality in the lives of many people , enforcing its own law , maintaining its own armed forces and collecting its own taxes . 
  the british liberal journal , * the nation * , wrote in august 1920 that `` the central fact of the present situation in ireland is that the irish republic exists '' . 
  ** atrocities ** the british forces , in trying to re-assert their control over the country , often resorted to brutal reprisals against irish civilians . 
  on [ bloody sunday ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bloody_sunday_\\ ( 1920 \\ ) ) , 21 november 1920 , fourteen british intelligence operatives were assassinated by the ira in dublin . 
  later that afternoon , british forces opened fire on hundreds of civilians at a gaelic football match , killing fourteen and wounding 65 . 
  one week later , british auxiliaries were ambushed by the ira during a patrol in cork . 
  in retaliation , the centre of cork city [ was burned to the ground ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_burning_of_cork ) by british forces . 
  ** ceasefire / anglo-irish treaty ( 1921 ) ** on 11 july 1921 , after more than two years of conflict , the british government called for a ceasefire . 
  this led to the signing of the [ anglo-irish treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-irish_treaty ) on 6 december 1921 . 
  this treaty ended british rule in most of ireland and led to the creation of the [ irish free state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_free_state ) . 
  however , northern ireland , which had been created by the [ government of ireland act 1920 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/government_of_ireland_act_1920 ) , had an option to opt out of the irish free state , which it exercised . 
  ** evacuation ( 1922 ) ** by october 1921 , the british army in ireland numbered 57,000 men , along with 14,200 ric police and 2,600 auxiliaries . 
  the long-planned evacuation from dozens of barracks across ireland started on 12 january 1922 , following the ratification of the treaty . 
  finally on 17 december 1922 , two historic seats of british rule in ireland , [ the royal barracks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collins_barracks,_dublin ) and [ dublin castle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_castle ) , were handed over to the new irish national army and the last british garrison left via dublin port that evening . 
  [ ** irish civil war ( 1922 -- 1923 ) ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_civil_war ) the anglo-irish treaty provided for a self-governing irish state . 
  however , the treaty also allowed northern ireland , where the majority population were descendants of british settlers , to opt out of the new state and return to the united kingdom -- which it did immediately . 
  the civil war was waged between two opposing groups ; irish nationalists and irish republicans . 
  irish nationalists supported the treaty , while the republican opposition saw it as a betrayal of the irish republic , which had been proclaimed during the 1916 rebellion to encompass the entire island of ireland . 
  the civil war was won by the pro-treaty irish nationalists . 
  today , two of the main political parties in ireland , [ fine gael ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fine_gael ) and [ fianna f\u00e1il ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fianna_f%c3%a1il ) are direct descendants of the opposing sides of the war . 
  [ ** the northern ireland conflict ( 1968 -- 1998 ) ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles ) the conflict was the result of discrimination against the irish nationalist minority by the british unionist majority and the question of northern ireland 's status within the united kingdom .

  needless to say , ni is a lot more peaceful today than it was thanks in part to the [ peace agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/good_friday_agreement ) . 
  however , there is still sectarian violence between the irish and british communities and a need to [ physically to separate ] ( http://imgur.com/a/iojvj ) them in some areas . 
  the conflict is still raw with many people and it will take many decades for wounds to heal .
