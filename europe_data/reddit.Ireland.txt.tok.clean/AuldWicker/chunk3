  [ gallery of the 1916 rebellion ] ( http://imgur.com/a/3zp1h )  the irish rebellion of 1916 , also known as the `` easter rising '' , was an armed insurrection centred in dublin with the aim of overthrowing british rule and igniting a revolution throughout ireland . 
  the two-week battle saw the heart of dublin city destroyed by british artillery and ended with the capture and execution of the irish leaders . 
  this marked the beginning of the irish revolutionary period ( 1916-1922 ) and the irish war of independence , during which time the british administration collapsed throughout most of ireland , paving the way for the modern republic of ireland .

  revered war hero to the british , detested genocidal maniac to the irish , oliver cromwell came to ireland in 1649 as head of the english army . 
  over half a million irish people perished during cromwell 's campaign . 
  only nine months in ireland , cromwell gave birth to death , exile , persecution , indentured slavery , and a form of 17th century ethnic cleansing . 
  his name is forever associated with a burning hatred for the irish people . 
  [ here are some descendants of cromwell 's irish slaves .

  the irish government bought 7000 e-voting machines for $ 56 million , never used them , sold them for scrap for $ 70,000 . 
  then they spent $ 38 million on a new postcode system . 
  when it launched last summer , fedex , dhl , ups declared that they could n't use it due to its design , and the irish postal service does n't have all the sorting equipment to process them . 
  irish planning .

  an amazon.ie where we can see prices in euros and pay local shipping would be great . 
  we have an excellent rapid transit system called the [ dart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_area_rapid_transit ) , but there are several level crossings along the route so it is n't strictly considered a metro . 
  it 's strongly held by the irish that we have * the * worst public transport system in all of europe . 
  indeed , we are one of the only eu capitals without a rail link to the fucking airport . 
  while the rest of the eu was pouring money into metros and rail infrastructure over the past two decades , ireland was fecking around with frivolous road projects and motorways to nowhere . 
  granted , we now have one of the best motorway networks in europe , so much so that it 's now faster to reach any part of ireland by road than it is by rail . 
  ireland 's rail network would n't exist today without heavy subsidies from the government . 
  it 's a miracle it 's still running at all . 
  dublin has an electrified heavy rail system called the [ dart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_area_rapid_transit ) . 
  it was built in the early 80s and is considered one of ireland 's most successful infrastructure projects . 
  however , they never expanded the dart network and it currently only serves the east coast of dublin and wicklow , physically disconnected from the west of dublin . 
  dublin also has a tram network called [ luas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luas ) since 2004 , which is hugely successful . 
  they are currently ripping up the centre of dublin city to connect the two luas tram lines that they should have connected in the first place . 
  irish planning . 
  however , what dublin needs badly is an underground rail system that links all of ireland 's rail lines with the capital and the airport . 
  this can only be done underneath dublin 's ancient and narrow streets , and the metro north line will solve that . 
  [ dart underground ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dart_underground ) is another important project that will link metro north with the rest of the rail network , but we simply do n't have the cash to build both right now .

  which means less cabin baggage space for everyone , which means more people will buy priority boarding .

  the last official russian visit to ireland https://youtu.be/oof6vqhz5pa  boris yeltsin , and the irish delegation awaiting his arrival at shannon airport were already on notice to expect the unexpected from a man who had established a reputation as a loud , drunken , boorish loose-cannon . 
   at shannon airport , long after the scheduled landing time , the dignitaries waited , and waited , and waited , while yeltsin 's aircraft circled inexplicably above . 
  after a full hour it finally landed , only to just sit on the runway , doors still closed , for a further 15 minutes . 
   eventually , russia 's deputy prime minister emerged from the plane . 
  he explained that yeltsin was asleep , and that the russian president would be unable to attend a scheduled news conference about the northern ireland peace process . 
  he invited the irish pm to visit russia and the plane went on its way . 
   the assembled world 's media did n't hesitate to read between the lines , firing out stories that the russian president , too drunk to negotiate a flight of steps , had `` snubbed '' ireland 's prime minister . 
  reynolds put on a brave face , saying : `` i completely understand . 
  mr yeltsin was acting on the orders of doctors who said it would be better for him not to get off the plane . 
  it 's funny because in ireland the `` mainland '' is continental europe but to unionists in ni it 's great britain . 
  i do n't see how another island can be the `` mainland '' , but i guess it 's just a term of endearment by the unionists for their old master . 
   at least on the mainland france ? 
  yeah , it 's an odd one .
