  * http://i.imgur.com/cwy6aiy.jpg in 1913 , two french photographers travelled around ireland with autochrome colour plates , capturing the first ever colour photos of ireland and the life of irish peasants . 
  knitted shawls were worn by all women and it was common for boys to wear a type of kilt up until their teens . 
  because most are n't . 
  completely taking the piss because europe lets them . 
  republic of scotland . 
  26th in ireland too . 
  also called wren day https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wren_day  the tradition consists of hunting a fake wren and putting it on top a decorated pole . 
  then the crowds celebrate the wren by dressing up in masks , straw suits , and colourful motley clothing . 
  they form music bands and parade through towns and villages . 
  keep deluding yourselves . 
  thought that said he * defected * to the woods , like he was a recluse or something . 
  i suppose car ownership will plummet over the next two decades as uber-like automated electric vehicles become the norm . 
  less mulling , more action . 
   who was a god , not a king both . 
  in irish mythology he was the king that led the first battle against the fir bolg . 
  would n't expect anything less from murdoch 's british fox news . 
  yeah , she might hold french citizenship , but anyone who wants to see the complete destruction of france and french culture can hardly be called french , or european for that matter . 
  and they were forced out of ireland by the english in the first place !, 
  +1 for connemara 's unspoiled beaches and roaming cattle . 
  boooo !, 
  should be banned from ever working in finance again . 
  same for n. ireland and scotland , too . 
  and they are all the main separatist regions of europe . 
  have you got 800 years ? 
  but i 'm talking about the word `` united '' in the current title , which did n't come about until 1800 . 
   united kingdom was first used with the previous ( 1701 ? ), 
  act of union between england and scotland . 
  source ? 
   fairly . 
  care to expand ? 
  i 'm talking about the `` united '' bit in the title , which has nothing to do with the act of union 1707 . 
  `` united '' came into being in 1800 when the kingdom of ireland joined the kingdom of great britain . 
   it is the ( united kingdom of great britain ) and ireland . 
  are you sure about that ? 
  is n't it the united ( kingdom of great britain ) + ( kingdom of ireland ) ? 
   the acts of union 1800 united the kingdom of great britain and the kingdom of ireland to create the united kingdom of great britain and ireland with effect from 1 january 1801 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_of_great_britain_and_ireland, 
  yes , they need it to cook mars bars . 
   it would n't be the united kingdom any more though would it ? 
  the `` united kingdom '' comes from the joining of the kingdom of great britain with the kingdom of ireland . 
  if scotland left , it would still be the united kingdom because of northern ireland . 
  and i very much doubt they would change the union flag if scotland left . 
   britain = uk . 
  in british english . 
  in ireland , `` britain '' usually means great britain , the island . 
   ~ ~ british people ~ ~ ** anyone ** can easily apply they just need to have at least one irish parent or grandparent . 
  [ citizensinformation.ie / irish_citizenship ] ( http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving_country/irish_citizenship/irish_citizenship_through_birth_or_descent.html#l091af ), 
  gaelic language and culture originated in ireland and spread to scotland 1,500 years ago as the irish ( aka [ the gaels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaels ) ) migrated there and formed [ d\u00e1l riata ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%c3%a1l_riata ) . 
  by the high middle ages , their language became dominant throughout scotland and the isle of man . 
  however , in most areas , the gaels were gradually anglicised and the gaelic languages supplanted by english . 
  scotland takes its name from the scoti people , a name used by late roman authors for the irish . 
  it 's true most dubs call it football , but i 'm a dub myself from a gaa background and we all call it soccer !, 
  just depends which sport is more popular i guess . 
  it 's mostly called soccer . 
  football refers to [ gaelic football ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teabwrdb9xu ) , which is the most popular spectator sport in ireland . 
  most of the irish media have a `` soccer '' section for association football and a `` football '' section for gaelic football . 
  having said that , many people call soccer `` football '' as well , particularly in areas where gaelic football is n't as popular . 
  west brits do . 
  on paper it look like a made up language but i heard a recording years ago on a documentary of an old woman speaking scots and it was completely indecipherable . 
  unfortunately the only samples i can find online today are of native english speakers speaking scots and it 's not the same . 
  i do n't even know if there are any true native speakers left as claimed . 
  ah sure they 'll be grand . 
  for the love of god , scotland , do n't fuck it up this time . 
  ah sure it 'll be grand . 
  you can always pop over to dublin to reminisce . 
  kerrygold , lol . 
  i hear it 's popular in germany . 
  but it 's not like north korea and south korea , which are roughly split down the middle . 
  northern ireland occupies only ~ 16 % of the island , not even close to half . 
  i suppose the deal is that they can call themselves northern ireland and we calls ourselves just ireland . 
  sure she was n't from naas ? 
  we have linguistic features in irish called [ eclipses and t/h-prothesis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_initial_mutations ) , which are never capitalised .

  in irish , wales is called * an bhreatain bheag * ( little britain ) , england is called * sasana * ( saxons ) , and our own country * \u00c9ire * is named after a gaelic goddess of ireland . 
  ** sounds animals make ** dog = * bhuf bhuf * cat = * m\u00eddheabh * duck = * bheac bheac * crow = * gr\u00e1g gr\u00e1g * bird = * ts\u00edp ts\u00edp * rooster = * a-ch\u00e1ich-\u00e9ir\u00edg\u00ed-\u00e9ir\u00edg\u00ed * ( everyone-get-up-get-up ) ** sounds humans make when calling animals ** calling dogs = * hulla hairc !,

   *** luas *** ( irish for `` speed '' ) is a tram/light rail system in dublin , ireland , which in 2015 carried 34.6 million passengers . 
  the system has fifty-four stations and 36.5 kilometres ( 22.7 mi ) of track , and 14 new stations are currently under construction . 
   luas operates without a state subvention . 
  the service recorded a surplus of $ 985,000 ( $ 680,000 in 2004 ) - an achievement well ahead of an anticipated deficit of $ 2.5 million  * 1998 : the irish government gives the green light to the light rail transit system . 
  * 2000 : construction of the first luas line starts . 
  * 2004 : the first line ( green line ) opens . 
  * 2004 : the second line ( red line ) opens . 
  * 2006 : luas carried its 50 millionth passenger . 
  * 2009 : the red line is extended by 1.5 km with 4 new stops . 
  * 2010 : the green line is extended by 11km with 9 new stops . 
  * 2011 : the red line is extended by 4.5 km with 5 new stops . 
  * 2013 : construction begins on luas cross city * 2017 : luas cross city line opens , adding 13 new stops in the city center https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luas, 
  both the irish place names and the english phonetics are official and in use . 
  the irish appears first on signage and the postal service will honour addresses in irish , but obviously english speakers are going to find the english phonetics easier . 
  it was easier for catalonia and valencia to phase out the castilian bastardisations because the orthography is very similar . 
  irish orthography is very different and difficult for english speakers to write . 
  it would be quite a task convincing all english speakers to only use irish versions where the english one has been in use for over a century . 
  having said that , after irish independence , some clearly british imperial place names were reverted back to irish and are in use today . 
  english speakers have no problem using these irish versions today . 
  i guess if there was enough policital will and public support to dump the english phonetics , it could be done .
