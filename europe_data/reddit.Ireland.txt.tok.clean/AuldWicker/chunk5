  until that happens , the english remains . 
   why this weird english adaptation ? 
  short answer : the british army . 
  the vast majority of english place names in ireland are just phonetic bastardisations of the original irish . 
  when the ordinance survey ireland , headed by the british army , was mapping ireland in the early 19th century , they sent a team around ireland to collect upwards of 100,000 place names for their maps . 
  ireland at the time was majority irish-speaking so they recorded a rough english phonetic translation of these place names which were then etched onto maps to be used by the british administration . 
  many of these english names have stuck to this day . 
  old lesbian band now . 
  here 's the world lit up green for paddy 's day every year . 
  i know , but people want to see euro prices on the product pages and listings . 
  post brexit , who knows , but we 've been pleading with amazon for years for a localised site . 
  we 're not asking to have fulfilment centres here nor do we expect amazon uk and its sellers to deliver everything to ireland . 
  all we 're asking is for some simple changes to amazon.co.uk , like showing estimated prices in euros and allowing us to filter by delivery country . 
  the irish market is big enough to deserve that at least . 
  it 's not up to britain . 
  only the people of ni and roi can decide on reunification . 
  britain would be glad to get rid of it . 
  remind you of home ?

  no gas = no craic :(, 
   republic of ireland not the name of the state . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_the_irish_state also the map of ireland is laughably incorrect and filled with spelling errors . 
  [ ogham ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ogham ) predates the arrival of the latin script to ireland . 
  you might be thinking of [ insular script ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insular_script ) , which the english then borrowed from us !, 
  the irish had a their own legal system and were writing [ long before ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_irish_literature ) england and the english language even existed , but this does n't suit the anti-irish narrative of some . 
  there are a lot of similarities between palestine and northern ireland .

  northern ireland by identity vs brexit http://i.imgur.com/ihcc3df.jpg, 
   spanair well , with a name like that . . 
  no it does n't . 
  uk 's territorial waters extend about 20km from the coast , which the cable does n't go through . 
  i wonder how uk authorities will get their grubby little hands on it . 
  heh , you 're tagged as r/europe 's [ pizzaburger expert ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5e6vuw/brexit_official_dutch_pizza_box_puts_irish_flag/daa7wnm/ ) !, 
  moving on , why is ireland 13 in the dataset but 28 in the bar chart ? 
  oh , d\u00fan na ngall , betrayed yet again by the paint bucket tool . 
   a third of your island ** 16 % !,

  it 's an interesting subject , one which i would like to know more but it seems very complicated . 
  from what i gather from speaking to valencians , they do n't deny that valencian is exactly the same as catalan , but they want their own identity separate from catalonia and thus call their dialect valencian . 
  i wonder how long it 's been like this though ? 
  i know valencia was part of the crown of aragon , but was it ever part of catalonia ? 
  do they not have a legitimate claim to differentiate themselves from the rest of the catalan-speaking regions ? 
  nope . 
  * here we all are now , all the lads . 
  * pass the biscuits , kosovo , we need to talk about [ ulster ] ( https://thumbs.gfycat.com/shrillmagnificenthumpbackwhale-size_restricted.gif ) . 
  i got the reference thanks to watching hubble docs . 
  talking out of one 's hole is a national sport in ireland which can mean winding someone up with bullshit stories . 
  it 's called `` talking out of yer hole '' , and he 's very good at it . 
   guilty of doing too little guilty of doing too much covering up more like , all because the perpetrators were n't white . 
  the current situation with irish is that it is dying out in the [ gaeltacht ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaeltacht ) . 
  these are government-protected regions where the language is spoken natively . 
  it simply can not compete with the never-ending tide of english speakers moving in and irish speakers moving out , no matter how much government money you throw at it . 
  however , each census for the past 20 years is showing an overall increase of irish speakers across ireland . 
  between 2006 and 2011 , the number people who use irish daily outside of the education system [ rose by 5,000 ] ( http://www.gaelport.com/default.aspx?treeid=37&amp;newsitemid=7882 ) , an upward trend which continues in the 2016 census . 
  why is this ? 
  it is partially to do with the [ gaelscoil movement ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1gesg6d.jpg ) . 
  these are schools that teach exclusively through irish and students graduate with much higher pass rates in the leaving certificate than other schools . 
  there is huge demand for these schools and waiting lists are long as the government are struggling to open them fast enough . 
  so , it 's a bit of a mixed bag for irish . 
  it 's dying out as a native language but growing faster as a second language across ireland . 
  it 's pronounced like * seltic * in a lot of european languages , but in english , and even in the celtic languages themselves , it 's pronounced with a * k * . 
  the only time i 've heard it pronounced * seltic * in english is when referring to the football club in scotland . 
  that 's irish . 
  wow , that 's a very detailed grid status . 
  the irish one is much simpler . 
   big brother-little brother kind of relationship . 
  more like rape victim . 
  isle of man is not in the uk !!!, 
  ^ ( someone 's got to stick up for them ), 
   irish accent is also a brittish accent because it 's not . 
  does everyone in the indian ocean have an indian accent ? 
  do mexicans have an american accent ? 
  you 're confusing geography with politics . 
  here 's two excellent videos explaining the origins of the northern ireland conflict * [ a brief history of the conflicts in the north of ireland ] ( https://youtu.be/fch6sdwr-wa ) * [ why ireland split into the republic of ireland & northern ireland ] ( https://youtu.be/dcjmqgfhxni ), 
  out of interest , do you use `` british '' do describe all people of the british isles ? 
   ireland are still net receivers [ not anymore ] ( https://www.businessworld.ie/economy/ireland-contributes-more-money-than-it-gets-to-eu-for-first-time-564636.html )  ireland has become a net contributor to the eu budget for the first time since it joined the bloc in 1973 . 
  the country paid $ 168m more to the eu than it received in grants and payments in 2014, 
  the british government admitted at the time that the famine was an opportune moment to reduce the irish population . 
  here 's a few quotes from charles e. trevelyan , the man who had prime responsibility for `` famine relief '' from the british government . 
   '' [ the famine is an ] effective mechanism for reducing surplus population ''  `` the judgement of god sent the calamity to teach the irish a lesson , that calamity must not be too much mitigated ''  `` the real evil with which we have to contend is not the physical evil of the famine , but the moral evil of the selfish , perverse and turbulent character of the people ''  `` we must not complain of what we really want to obtain . 
  if small farmers go , and their landlords are reduced to sell portions of their estates to persons who will invest capital we shall at last arrive at something like a satisfactory settlement of the country '' . 
  112 in ireland . 
  is n't that the number we agreed on !, 
  i think santy comes from [ saint\u00ed ] ( http://www.focloir.ie/en/dictionary/ei/santa ), 
  oh boy , i do love a good civil war so i do . 
  does n't help that dublin city council have banned tall buildings . 
  now we have 4-storey shoeboxes built in the heart of the docklands , some of the most expensive land in the world , all because councillors think dublin should remain a quaint , low-rise village . 
  meanwhile dublin is in the depths of a massive housing crisis and rents are the highest in the world . 
   in a way , if you think about , ireland -- southern ireland -- is still part of the european union wow , i just realised that as well . 
  because `` southern ireland '' is * technically * an independent country , brexit does n't affect its status in the eu at all . 
  let 's take advantage of this loophole !, 
  and manx . 
  look , everyone , i found the guy who eats pizzaburgers !, 
  he 's r/europe 's pizzaburger expert .
