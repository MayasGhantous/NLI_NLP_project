  great my shame : my own children who sold their mother . 
  lots of disappointed illegal economic migrants on that i 'd say . 
  no hotel europe for you , folks . 
  [ suime\u00e1la\u00ed ] ( http://www.tearma.ie/search.aspx?term=integral ), 
  ah , but you 'll still have to pay roaming charges . 
  back to enjoy the generous social welfare state and plan the next attack from within . 
  well at least the trams are still running . 
  i like the purity of this monoglot 's irish . 
   `` i speak irish and say it like that . 
  it 's my dialect '' oh yes , lots of those people around . 
  `` i 'm irish , do n't you dare point out blatantly bad irish ! '', 
  when the duolingo course started , they got a learner to do the recordings , who mispronounced everything . 
  the course mods ( also non-native speakers ) said it was just a matter of dialect !, 
  so , apparently this `` dialect '' does n't different between * leabhar * and * leabhair * , or * a ch\u00f3ta * and * a c\u00f3ta * , so how the fuck are you meant to communicate properly in this butchered `` dialect '' ? 
  after repeated complaints , they finally admitted it was wrong and got a native speaker to re-record everything . 
  british-administered north-east of ireland . 
  it 's very worrying . 
  inbreeding leads to extremely low iqs , which is perfect for indoctrination . 
  til reddit 's thumbnail generator picks the last image on the page . 
  well done to svalbard and jan mayen , never even heard of them . 
  and expecting the rest of us to share the burden . 
  changing the face of germany , literally . 
  ^ somebody fell for the fake news . 
  irish navy of virtue : `` migrants for * you * and * you * and * you !, 
  * '' ^ ( . . but nowhere near ireland , are you fucking * insane ? 
  and when the welfare state collapses , what are all these young , jobless men going to turn to ? 
  it 's going to get very ugly . 
  only another 22,850 to go ( [ that we know of ] ( https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/huge-scale-of-terror-threat-revealed-uk-home-to-23-000-jihadists-3zvn58mhq ) ), 
  hence why snowden is in russia and assange in holed up in an embassy . 
  like a frog in boiling water . 
   but , please , take a look at the title : `` kicks out '' . 
  makes it sound like austria abused his rights , or persecuted him it 's no secret that the bbc are one of the most pro-immigration media organisations out there . 
  they are always pushing an agenda . 
  * [ bbc had ` deep liberal bias ' over immigration , says former news chief ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jul/03/bbc-deep-liberal-bias-immigration ) * [ bbc biased towards pro-immigration lobby , says study ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/10085715/bbc-biased-towards-pro-immigration-lobby-says-study.html ), 
  why would n't it be a thing ? 
  ireland is inconsequential to british people . 
  the recent cosying up to the dup and shitting on the peace agreement is just a recent example of how little the british know or care about ireland . 
  glad to see this going around , really sums it up . 
  the greeks used it alright , but the british brought it into the english language 400 years ago when busy pillaging ireland . 
  they never tell you that bit :d, 
   because it 's fucking miles away that 's never stopped you from stamping `` british '' on things that are n't yours   dee coined the term `` british empire '' and built his case , in part , on the claim of a `` british ocean '' ; including britain , ireland , iceland and greenland . 
  he used alleged saxon precedent to claim territorial and trading rights . 
   why do n't you call iceland british ? 
  they tried . 
   dee coined the term `` british empire '' and built his case , in part , on the claim of a `` british ocean '' ; including britain , ireland , iceland and greenland . 
  he used alleged saxon precedent to claim territorial and trading rights . 
   british people know that ireland is not a part of the uk hahahahaha . 
  the average brit has no idea where their borders begin and end . 
  source : lived in uk for 2 years . 
  i think a good comparison would be if spain called the landmass `` the spanish peninsula '' and then getting angry when the portuguese point out they 're not spanish . 
  the spaniards use meneame.net . 
  ireland will wise up he 's learning . 
  we call ourselves ireland so we do n't have to change the name after reunification . 
  english speakers often pronounce it * tee-shock * , but native irish speakers pronounce the * t * and the * ch * differently . 
  they never answer this one . 
  deport them to an eu-funded immigration centre in libya and they will quickly remember their nationality . 
   opinion : mohammed harun arsalai oh , [ this guy ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/05/responsible-deadly-refugee-journeys-170522080533683.html?platform=hootsuite ) . 
  does n't distinguish between genuine refugees and illegal migrants , is pro-open borders . 
  likes whipping up fear about `` nazis '' , `` far-right '' , `` fascists '' . 
  ticks all the boxes really . 
  ^ where are all these nazis you people never shut up about ? 
  europe must be completely overrun with nazis by now , invisible ones . 
  how tiresome . 
  speaking negatively of the harsh reality it too much to bear for some . 
  looks like an nvidia demo . 
  yeah , he 'll probably sue the spanish state for millions . 
  it just needs 50,000 volts . 
  would you like your steak * a la akbar * or * a la j' ihad * ? 
  in the 16th and early 17th century , before the english [ took control ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cromwellian_conquest_of_ireland ) over ireland , there was a busy trade route between ireland , spain and portugal . 
  in galway city on the west coast you can still see the remains of the [ spanish arch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_arch ) , where spanish galleons used to dock . 
  during this period , the tribes of galway controlled most trade from the west of ireland until the english besieged galway in the mid 1600s . 
  from then onward , all trade from ireland was controlled by the english , who naturally favoured trade with great britain and her colonies . 
  they forced our mobile operators to ditch roaming charges . 
  i mean really . 
  ffs , germany , would you ever cop on to yourself . 
  because there are as many people in dublin ( 1.3 million ) as the rest of leinster ( 1.3 million ) , they are often split for polling and stats . 
  at least in this union we are not murdered for being irish . 
  that 's always a plus, 
  and the north-east of ireland : http://i.imgur.com/koshwdh.jpg, 
  it 's no real surprise ireland is so pro-europe after being cock-blocked by britain from trading with them for centuries . 
  also , independence came at a great cost and the economy never really recovered until the 90s after receiving a lot of funding from the eu . 
   asked if they agreed with the statement `` given that the uk has voted to leave the eu , ireland should also leave the eu '' , just 16 per cent said they agreed . 
  to be honest , asking irish people `` uk did this thing , should you copy them ? 
  '' , they are probably going to say no before you even finish the question !,

  el partido popular lives on in his memory  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/12/spain-security-law-protesters-freedom-expression, 
  got ta garner those votes somehow . 
  you honestly think if pro-immigration schulz was in power he 'd do anything different to merkel ? 
   incompetent at integration . 
  incompetent at protecting borders and enforcing immigration laws . 
  you ca n't possibly integrate the enormous amounts of migrants that have come into europe over the past decades . 
  ghettoisation is always going to happen when you have a disastrous open borders policy . 
  when bannings were literal beheadings . 
  rest assured kfc have their best man on the case . 
  perhaps catalonia should set up a paypal account ? 
  i can throw them 20 $ . 
  virtue signalling from his golden tower like a lot of european politicians . 
   `` migrants for * you * and * you * and * you * , but not near my home , are you * insane * ? 
  also important is the direction and wetness of the rain , because in ireland it is horizontal and seeps into your bone marrow .
