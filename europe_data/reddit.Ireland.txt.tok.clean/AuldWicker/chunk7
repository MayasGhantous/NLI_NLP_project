  if dublin wants to be competitive with other eu capitals , the government has to repeal the council 's [ ridiculous restrictions on high density ] ( https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/dublin-city-council-asked-to-reverse-apartment-height-limits-1.2759551 ) . 
  we 've a severe housing shortage in the city which is causing astronomical rents and urban sprawl . 
  there is also an enormous infrastructure deficit . 
  we have no rail link to the airport and the heavy rail lines are not connected properly in the city . 
  we need to fast-track the [ dart underground ] ( https://youtu.be/kepttyz_1c4?t=72 ) and [ metro north ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svjvazs8f_q ) projects , which already had planning permission but no government seems to have the balls to go through with them . 
  if we continue to allow immigration at the current rate , it does n't take a genius to realise that europeans * will * eventually be replaced . 
  very wise , so should europe . 
  she would have loved to use them on the irish . 
  dublin does n't have ghettos though . 
  ^ tl ; dr : `` ireland is british . 
  now piss off , mick ! '', 
   did n't say you are . 
  it 's funny because i have you tagged suggesting you 've been at this before , 
  heroin and shitty weather ? 
  we 'd do n't have nor need tanks in ireland . 
  we have 14 of [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sflgtw1.jpg ) little things and 80 of [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ewsnjsr.jpg ) apcs , and a bunch of other armoured vehicles . 
  what ireland really needs is a fighter jet so we can protect our own airspace effectively . 
  people say it 's not worth the cost but i do n't think we should be relying on a foreign country [ to do it for us either ] ( http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/royal-air-force-jets-scramble-to-intercept-russian-bombers-circling-uk-and-ireland-35437672.html ) . 
   hatred for polish people , spurred on by geert wilders source on his hatred for polish people ? 
  i thought his problem was with muslims . 
   sick man of europe well , would n't that be a role reversal , but i do n't believe it for a second . 
  i think it should be scrapped to be honest . 
  the original idea was to reverse the declining population after independence and repatriate people whose descendants were forced out of the country . 
  http://i.imgur.com/cdjb5tg.jpg ireland 's population has been recovering now since the 60s so i see no point in this passport bonanza . 
  people seem to just use it to enjoy eu citizenship and have no intention of living in ireland . 
   you are the only bigot here . 
  i should 've checked your comments before , so i would n't had lost time trying to speak with a bigot and an ira supporter . 
  i will just block you . 
  ^ http://i.imgur.com/1fncbzq.jpg he goes through my post history desperately searching for comments but can only find me talking positively about spain and the spanish . 
  knowing he has completely lost the argument , he resorts to `` ira supporter '' and blocks me . 
  exact same tactic of the unionist bigots in northern ireland . 
  thanks for proving my point so wonderfully , u/rainymeadow . 
   so why after saying for the 4th time that i did n't mean to offend anyone you still refuse to believe me ? 
  because seriously , i did n't mean to offend anyone . 
  i can repeat it again , i do n't mind . 
  found that evidence of xenophobia yet ? 
  did n't think so . 
  you 're a complete liar nobody here should waste their time with . 
   argument ? 
  this is not a discussion . 
  i did n't want to offend anyone ( 3rd time i have to say it ) the problem here is that you refuse to believe me just because my country of origin , is n't it ? 
  still waiting for you to provide evidence of your outrageous claim that i 'm prejudiced and xenophobic towards spanish people , but we both know you ca n't . 
  it 's just a cowardly diversion tactic on your part because you lost the argument three posts ago . 
   you have your own prejudices about me just because of my country of origin . 
  source ? 
  or is this your defence mechanism because you know you have no argument ? 
   everyone in the fucking world adds `` o '' at the end of the words to make it sound like spanish but they do n't do it to be bigoted against a certain group in spain , do they . 
  big difference . 
   i find funny to add `` o '' at the end of each word to make it sound like spanish . 
  i find it bigoted to be honest , especially considering spain 's shameful past in relation to minority languages . 
  linguistic superiority over a subjugated group . 
  this type of bigotry is common with british unionists in northern ireland , eg . 
  * se\u00e1n * becomes * john * , and they find ways to [ ridicule the language ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-29895593 ) . 
  i 've seen time and again spanish unionists behaving exactly the same towards catalans and their language online , and this subreddit is no exception . 
  i 've never seen that last photo of the rifles and barrels before . 
  here 's another gallery of the 1916 irish rebellion http://imgur.com/a/3zp1h, 
  that ? 
  they barely even tried . 
  it was planned to fail from the start . 
  our navy is already out there , assisting the illegal traffickers . 
  `` there 's a fire in the building . 
  we better stop selling matches . '', 
  how about a naval blockade instead ? 
  but the correct way to detain a beast . 
   it 's pretty simple why they hate us . 
  we 've destabilized the entire region for decades . 
  that 's a very foolish misunderstanding of the situation . 
  the jihadists who are slaughtering us in the streets do so * primarily * because we are unbelievers . 
  it has a lot more to do with ideology of islam than you think , which is a far more worrying problem than just foreign policy in the middle east . 
  this is a very worrying trend in recent years . 
  where is it coming from ? 
  ireland was raided a few times by the luftwaffe . 
  one bomb was dropped near the president 's residence almost killing him . 
   about 2am on may 31 , 1941 , the luftwaffe dropped four high-explosive bombs across north dublin , killing 28 people . 
  one of the bombs came within a whisker of killing president hyde . 
  one of the windows of the president 's bedroom in which he was at the time sleeping was broken and a portion of the mantelpiece was dislodged . 
   irrespective of whether the nazis had intended to bomb dublin , it is hard not to imagine irish history would have been radically different if the luftwaffe bomb had landed a short distance further north and killed president hyde . 
  in this scenario , it would have been considerably more difficult for de valera to keep ireland out of the war . 
  so gaelic and manx are different as far as you 're concerned ? 
  practically none . 
  it 's quite amazing how different they are despite there being only 80 kilometres between us . 
  celtic syntax and morphology is similar but vocab and orthography is very different . 
  scots gaelic is very similar , especially to the ulster irish dialect . 
  it 's akin to the mutual intelligibility between portuguese and galician . 
  to me it reads like irish 500 years ago . 
  they never had an extensive spelling reform like irish did . 
  interested why you say irish gaelic but not manx gaelic or welsh brythonic ? 
  i 've never understood this usage because we never call it that in ireland . 
  * no comment *, 
  the impression i got driving through belgium is that the public realm is noticeably run down and tatty whereas in nl everything is immaculate and looks like it was built yesterday . 
  it ca n't be for lack of funding , surely . 
  are the belgians just not as arsed culturally ? 
  and i 'm not dissing belgium , ireland 's public realm is really shabby as well . 
  that 's one of the most european things i 've ever seen . 
  the luxembourgers are the pandas of europe . 
  what the fuck are the dutch doing up in the alps ? 
  get down from there . 
  i wonder would they notice if we just stole their entire wiki page ? 
  i think he 's mixed race . 
  would it still be safe to travel to czechia ?
