  note : i 'm from dublin and would like to see ni as a successful nation like scotland that we can have better relations with like the relations between ireland and the rest of the uk . 
  northern what now ? 
  the entire no campaign was mostly funded by evangelistic organisations in the usa . 
  that 's how they could afford to put up almost double the posters of the yes side . 
  dublin will just have to carry wicklow kicking and screaming into the 21st century . 
  and there lies the problem, 
  recently it 's become a topic more so than before . 
  there are several good proposals for different ways to allow some people outside ireland to vote but to change who can vote would require a referendum in ireland and unfortunately this is not very important to people still living here so there still is n't enough incentive for the government to legislate on it . 
  the reason irish people can only vote in ireland is that there is potentially up to 70 million people eligible to become irish citizens in the world and over 20 million of these already are , only 4.6 million people live in ireland . 
  this is a situation very unique to ireland in the scale of it . 
  the fear is that people voting from outside ireland would outnumber voters living in ireland overwhelmingly and this could result in a vote having a result that the local population do n't agree with . 
  essentially we could have a situation where the decisions that effect people living here could be made by people who do n't live here . 
  the reason irish people can only vote in ireland is that there is potentially up to 70 million people eligible to become irish citizens in the world and only 4.6 million people in ireland . 
  the fear is that people voting from outside ireland would outnumber voters living here and this could result in a referendum passing or failing or a government with no local support been successful in a vote . 
  it 's been reported in the news also . 
  ryanair and aer lingus had to put on extra flights for the increased demand . 
  to ireland is voting on marriage equality . 
  when it passes today homosexual marriage will be fully legal ( we already have civil marriage but there are several differences ) . 
  it will make ireland the first country in the world to give the lgbt community equal rights by popular vote . 
  on ireland about 1.3 million of the 4.6 million people living here live in dublin . 
  that 's about 30 % of the population living in one area . 
  we never blamed the eu for the recession and having to get a bailout here . 
  even during the worst of the recession ireland was one of the eu 's biggest supporters and support for the euro has always been very strong . 
  all blame was always directed at the government that was in power leading up to the recession . 
  that 's not what i said . 
  what i meant is it costs millions of euro to hold a referendum and is a huge undertaking . 
  would it not be more efficient to have several referendums held together every few years . 
  i know but the cost of holding so many referendums must be huge . 
  and i thought we have a lot of referendums at one or two every few years . 
  seriously how can you have so many . 
  the chart is wrong for ireland . 
  here you can get 15gb for $ 20 or 30gb for $ 35 on three 's 4g network . 
  ** irish ( gaeilge ) ** grianghrafad\u00f3ireachta = photography there seems to be some disagreement to what is the longest word as there are some longer words but some argue that they are just multiple words in one ( i do n't get it either ) . 
  also some medical terms are longer but medical terms are not word used daily . 
   ireland was already pushing for independence before world war ii . 
  ireland was already independent for over 20 years before wwii , hence we were n't in the war . 
  it was a coin issued in ireland to celebrate 10 years of the euro . 
  it was designed by a primary school student here aged about 5 or 6 . 
  i probably should have put / s after that comment . 
  i just thought it was very funny . 
  best reason i 've heard so far to vote yes . 
  here 's post from a few day 's ago that asked the same thing . 
  there are some good answers in it . 
  the unionist in ni hate us so much that they might declare independence from the uk if we were part of it again . 
  in ireland it 's amazing . 
  it has every road , address , business and even all the pedestrian only areas such as hiking tracks . 
  it even has indoor areas such as maps of the layout of the large shopping centre , so if you can find a shop it will direct you to the shop and the floor it 's on . 
  people here only use google maps . 
  sat navs such as garmin and tomtom are no existent here in recent years . 
  i think it 's so good because google 's european hq is here and they employ thousands of people and have a huge presence in ireland . 
  with all of these infographs ands stats been posted lately you would never think we had a bailout . 
  it depends on the job you get and other factors . 
  ireland has very high wages but is also on of the most expensive countries in the eu in terms of cost of living . 
  i 'm a student currently and working part time in retail . 
  i make $ 10.56 an hour ( 1.5 x this on sunday 's and double on bank holidays , xmas etc. 
  it 's about an average retail wage ) . 
  with this job i can pay my college fee 's , go on a holiday each year and afford a 2009 vw golf . 
  i do n't think there are many countries in the eu where i could afford all of this on a part time job but college fee 's here are very low compared to most of the eu . 
  celtic tiger economy 2.0 lads !!!, 
  let 's start partying again !, 
  ** ireland ** [ put 'em under pressure !, 
  - we 're all part of jackie 's army ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5pt65i2ny8 ) this song was written for the italia 90 world cup and is probably the most well know song in ireland . 
  even people born after the world cup know the words and when there is a world cup on it 's on the radio 24/7 . 
  [ scooter - `` the logical song '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yxta1auqps ) to this day you ca n't go to a nightclub in ireland without hearing this song played at least once even after 13 years since it 's release . 
  we ca n't allow the us to use this agreement to dictate eu foreign policy . 
  can ttip get any worse ? 
  actually we have had civil marriage for a few years now . 
  we are also having a referendum in a few weeks to change the constitution so there will no longer be a distinction between civil marriage and marriage . 
  i really hope the poles are wrong . 
  i do n't want to see sinn fein in power here . 
  there policies make no sense and their economic plan is a disaster but worst of all i do n't want the head of the ira to be our next taoiseach ( prime minister ) . 
  sinn fein is just the political wing of the ira and that 's the reason they have never done well in an election in the republic , just because we are experiencing economic hardship does n't mean you should vote for the ira to spite the other parties . 
   the low figure is 250,000 and the higher at 400,000 , a considerable number for a country of ~ 4,677,000 people . 
  i agree that there was a huge number of people who left ireland during the recession but some context is needed . 
  this only shows a 20 % increase in the number of people leaving ireland . 
  i ca n't find the article now that i read as it was a few months ago ( i wasted 20 minutes looking for it : / ) but according to it several surveys of people leaving ireland found that only 2 in every 10 were leaving ireland at the height of the recession was because of not been able to find a job and been on social welfare or students who feared ending up on social welfare . 
  this is still a stupidly big number for any 1st world country even if it was only for a few years . 
  the rest was general emigration that happens even during good times . 
  had those people stayed the effect would have not been anywhere near what the numbers suggest . 
  also during this period the population of ireland continued to grow as a result of immegration and birth . 
  this emigration increase only resulted in a slight slowing of population growth not fall in population . 
  i think the media is mostly to blame for making the emigration issue look much bigger than it really was . 
  edit : i 'll link the article if i can find it . 
  i 'll let you in on the secret to how ireland pay 's for everything . 
  ^ we ^ let ^ the ^ eu ^ fund ^ it ^ :d, 
  good news !!!, 
  we are richer than the uk , so ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita, 
  ireland already has civil union but our constitutions from the 1930 's defines marriage as been between a man and a woman . 
  this referendum is just a vote to change the wording to include same sex marriage . 
  a referendum is needed as under irish law our constitution can not be changed without majority support for the change by national referendum . 
  i do n't think there is one . 
  i think they chose ireland because of a case last year where microsoft successfully told the usa to fuck off when they tried to gain access to microsoft servers in ireland and the government backed microsoft up saying if the servers are in ireland it 's irish law , it does n't matter if the company is american . 
  10 years ago ireland was very rich , now ireland is very rich . 
  we do n't talk about what happened during the 10 years though . 
  all that matters is that we are rich again . 
  it was most likely a grenade from the war of independence or the civil war that followed . 
  people find grenades and bombs from the time almost weekly here so finding the grenade alone is n't really news worthy . 
  the rankings in this are completely wrong . 
  here is the correct rankings form 2014 , the 2015 ranking will not be out until the end of the year . 
  the uk is not a country but a collection of countries .
