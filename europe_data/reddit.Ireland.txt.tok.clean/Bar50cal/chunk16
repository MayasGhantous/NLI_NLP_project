  there is only 2 armed response police units in dublin . 
  ordinary police are n't armed and only certain detectives have a handgun , there are not armed checkpoint around dublin . 
  there was for about an hour after the shooting in that area which is normal practice after any shooting . 
  there is not a huge drug war going on that has everyone in dublin frightened . 
  this article as with all guardian articles that have anything to do with ireland is full of crap and extremely biased to make ireland look bad . 
  both . 
  they sold drugs to fund themselves but would n't let anyone else sell them . 
  but who is holding the title 2 years in a row ? 
  hopefully we can make it 3  [ six nations - ireland v wales : do n't let it go ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1x6wd68gau ), 
  today is the start this year 's six nations come on ireland , let 's show the welsh how rugby should be played !!, 
  well i 've never seen any irish media or other european media portray that europeans hate people from the us . 
  is this us media or european media ? 
  how the hell did they get eru uniforms . 
  ireland only has 3 eru units ( emergency response unit , the only armed response units in the country ) . 
  we have an unarmed police force so how did they get the exceptionally rare armed units uniforms, 
  our economy is actually larger now than before the recession , it 's now getting bigger than it ever was . 
  that 's what makes this so impressive as it goes beyond the initial recovery of the economy . 
  is n't there a simular agreement in place between ireland and northern ireland with cross border warrants and garda\u00ed can continue to chase suspects if they cross the border and vice versa , then when the suspect is caught the psni or garda\u00ed extradite him/her the same day . 
  does the fact the every nation in the un agrees that what the israeli government is doing is wrong . 
  even your closest ally the us claims the settlements and policies surrounding them are illegal under international law and yet somehow we are all wrong about it and israel is right ? 
  and this is probably the main reason the dup want the opposite . 
  northern ireland 's politics all to often comes down to one party doing not wanting to agree with the other just because ... 
  he was irish not british : /, 
  do you know what the commonwealth is ? 
  you can be a republic and be in the commonwealth . 
  the reason we were classed as british subjects is because until 1949 we were a british dominion like australia or canada . 
   the name hibernia was taken from greek geographical accounts ( from ) claudius ptolemaeus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hibernia i looked but ca n't find the first example of the personification of hibernia a women . 
  for anyone that does n't know . 
  [ hibernia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hibernia ) is the personification of and latin for ireland . 
  the statue of her above the [ gpo ( general post office ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_post_office,_dublin ) in dublin which was the centre of the [ 1916 rebellion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/easter_rising ) against british rule in ireland is what is shown on the coin . 
  why are so many brits convinced that the germans singlehandedly run the eu . 
  like all members the german 's ca n't do anything without the support of the other members nations . 
  i do n't understand either how we can have a single currency but not a fiscal union . 
  you might want to watch the news a bit more . 
  when restructuring our economy the double irish loophole for us companies was closed and existing companies only have a limited time to get their affairs in order . 
  our entire economy collapsed in 2008 , the eu and imf had to give us a huge bailout similar to greece but now our economy is the fastest growing in the eu ( by a lot ) and is actually bigger now than before the bailout . 
  wow , almost 70 % want out . 
  why is there such an anti eu sentiment there ? 
  what is the general opinion in northern ireland to a possible brexit . 
  are people divided or generally leaning one way or the other ? 
  the irish manufacturing plant was built back in 1982 before apple got so big and had to start contracting out work .

  the ira also recieved training in north korea, 
  it was scary how well they could get around . 
  in 1991 they actually carried out a mortar attack on 10 downing street . 
  i 'm irish but i was exempt from learning it in school so i was hoping some other irish speaking person could explain . 
  why does ireland begin with `` an t '', 
  i ca n't tell if your a troll or an idiot . 
  it was fucking idiots like you in the us funding the ira that kept the fighting going for so long . 
  they did that too in the uk and ireland, 
  not really that surprising . 
  people wanting to get and learn about a huge part of their history that has been forbidden to them for 70 years . 
  i have a big interest in history and have read mein kampf to get a better understanding of adolf hitler and how he developed such a cult following and made a cultured modern national do well ... 
  i do n't need to explain . 
  i 'm not suprised so many germans want to get a better understanding of their history . 
  also the book is a terrible read . 
  it 's complete rubbish and very hard to read , i can garauntee 90 % of reads wo n't get past the first few chapters . 
   why does it look like the level of fear in western europe is so much higher today than in the 1970s and 1980s ? 
  i can guarantee that fear levels in the uk and ireland today are no where even close to in the 1970 's and 80 's, 
  and france and the uk, 
  if you have money in any country there are no waiting times . 
  most country 's in the eu also have state pensions . 
  just by having worked for x years in a country you get a state pension , no need to pay into it as it comes from general taxation .

  in ireland we learn english as that 's the language we speak . 
  as a second language we learn irish which is not a foreign language . 
  then as a third language we learn a european language ( most commonly french , spanish or german ) . 
  that is why it is so uncommon for people to speak a second or third foreign language . 
  because a second foreign language is actually a third language and a third foreign language in this graphic is actually a forth language for irish people . 
  i think this is more suitable for / r/ireland , i doubt the rest of europe cares about dublin bus drivers . 
  also i find dublin bus drivers very kind and have seen the shit they put up with from some inner city commuters and am amazed they do n't complete lose it and somehow remain patient whe dealing with them . 
  also you must always thank the bus driver when disembarking ... always !, 
  ** ireland ** nothing has really happened here this week . 
  yesterday the country literally shut down for christmas , all businesses , the airports everything was closed . 
  no way in or out of the island for 24 hours . 
  it was a day for being with family and friends . 
  the only real news was that the taoiseach ( our prime minister ) ruled out a coalition government between his fine gael party and anyone but the labour party who he is currently in government with in the upcoming election . 
  also it has n't stopped raining in weeks .

  it 's damn near impossible to get a good cup of tea anywhere outside our fair isles . 
  i 'd also like to say , suck it uk, 
  could n't agree more . 
  worst airport i 've ever used . 
  wrong . 
  more people were born each year than died and emigrated . 
  our population would be growing without immigration . 
  yeah unbelievably the sale and importing of of them was illegal until 1978 . 
  abortion is one of the last really big things left from catholic ireland that has no place in modern ireland .
