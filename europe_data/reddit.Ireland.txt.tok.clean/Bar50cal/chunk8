  it 's just a very small minority in the south that ca n't understand the past is the past . 
  yeah they are both very good banks with a lot of branches in the uk for foreign banks . 
  completely bankrupt and still in the top ten :d, 
  oooooooooooooooooh snap !, 
  how is ireland socially backward , in our last presidential election the favorite to win for most of the election was david norrisn an openly gay man and equal rights campaigner . 
  the only reason he lost was because of a scandal he was involved in and for over 20 years previous we had female presidents for 4 terms . 
  we are one of the most open countries in europe when it comes to accepting other beliefs and foreigners ( very unlike parts of scotland ) . 
  last year our government gave gay couples as much rights as possible without holding a referendum as our constitution ca n't be change without one . 
  they said at the time there will be a referendum but we had more important things to worry about at the time ( almost went into a second huge recession and everything took a back seat ), 
  your looking to far into a spelling mistake, 
  as i said ` amerika ' is the german translation . 
  he is german and made a very understandable mistake . 
  the difference between the two is very small . 
  that 's the german translation . 
  well she did send the sas ( british special forces ) against unarmed civilians in ireland . 
  ireland is a very small country but has been very influential member of the eu more so than many countries bigger than it . 
  i 'm not saying we have as much influence as germany or france but having the eu presidency at the moment is helpful . 
  does n't matter you ca n't touch me . 
  yeah you should try that . 
  ireland will just sit on the sidelines again and see how things pan out . 
  if only we were that big . 
  from how well we are conversing i say we create a new party , the reddit party . 
  we could n't do any worse ? 
  currently in ireland all truck drivers have a special licence called a tachograph card which the driver must insert in a special machine to start the truck . 
  it the record if they speed or drive more hours in a day than is legal in the eu so if a garda ( irish cop ) pulls them over they ask for the card and can see a record of the last 2 weeks . 
  this system has been in use for several years now and has been very successful but government studies have shown it would not word for private cars . 
  sinn fein would be a disaster , they would ignore the economy , health care and everything else important and just hold vote after vote on unification with ireland . 
  at least with a dup / sinn fein split they do stuff . 
  do n't even joke about that . 
  then they would be able to do stuff without checking with london / dublin, 
  i linked the wikipedia page because that particular page has extremely accurate information about the history of ireland almost all of which is related to the celts , just look at the bibliography and references to see the quality of the information , we were called the celtic tiger because we are a celtic country that was undergoing rapid economic growth and i have dyslexia so i misspell words now and again . 
  also having studied irish history for several years now i really do n't think you no anything about it having said `` irish people are not , nor ever have been celts '', 
  volcano erupted and iceland sank . 
  you sir could n't be more wrong if you tried . 
  if you knew anything about irish history you would see ireland could n't be more celtic if we tried . 
  ( note : i 'm a history student ) hence our nickname in europe as the `` celtic tiger '' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ireland also a celtic block would be awesome . 
  it would solve a lot of problems , but i think we would be a bit lonely in the republic . 
  i like how ireland remains completely unchanged . 
  the current irish license is pink like the french, 
  whoever wrote this article has no idea what they are talking about . 
  for example in ireland private companies have very strict rules about what they can and ca n't do with personal information . 
  they ca n't do whatever they want with it like the author of this article says . 
  the `` official languages act 2003 '' officially made the irish language the official and first language of ireland . 
  that is why all government documents are printed in both irish and english . 
  it was done so the eu would give funding to irish language promotion . 
  in west galway you here an equal amount of people using both . 
  in ireland we ca n't decide which language to use . 
  our official language irish `` nollag '' ( only spoken by a very small minority ) or english . 
  flat 7up cures all illness 's in ireland . 
  ireland 's result is inaccurate because most of dublin has access to 250mb broadband and now some areas have 1gb speed available ( sandyford ) . 
  the rest of ireland your lucky to get 10mb if even so it averages as 10mb . 
  if you removed dublin from it out average would plummet . 
  i think it 's great that our constitution ca n't be changed without a referendum . 
  it prevents governments from pushing through changes they want but the population might not want . 
  come to ireland , we have one almost every year . 
  our government ca n't go for a piss without asking us first . 
  a movie filmed in ireland with irish and american actors, 
  nope, 
  for hundreds of years irish raiders would raids along the british coast and any ships around ireland . 
  there 's a reason rome never tried to invade ireland , we were way to up for the fight so it would have been to costly for ireland 's limited resources . 
  an abortion thread and no one is talking about ireland . 
  this is a nice change . 
  we 'll legalise it eventually . 
  polish is now the biggest immigrant group in ireland surpassing the uk .

  we already do that in ireland for decades . 
  guess what ... it 's had no ill effects .

  god damn dennis o'brien knocking us down the list !, 
  it 's ok . 
  i think everyone accepts now it british and irish humor to take the piss out of ourselves and each other . 
  video is geo locked to uk : /, 
  the naming situation is very similar to the one we had in ireland . 
  for almost 80 years after we got independence until the signing of the peace treaty in northern ireland in 1998 that the uk would not call ireland ` ireland ' . 
  everyone in the world knew the state as ireland but the uk would insist on calling us ` southern ireland ' , ` republic of ireland ' ( we are a republic but it 's not the name of the country ) or more commonly just ` the republic ' or ` eire ' instead of ' \u00c9ire ' ( eire is irish for burden while \u00c9ire is irish for ireland ) . 
  although the bbc still does this . 
  this was because they did not want to insinuate ireland ( the state was the same as ireland ( the island ) . 
  the same way we refused to accept the term ` british isles ' thankfully now both ireland and great britain have gotten past the whole thing and all our other animosity . 
  they now call us ireland and no longer use the term british isles officially . 
  the uk is now ireland 's greatest ally ( bff 's , ^ sorry ^ usa ) . 
  now if only northern ireland could grow up . 
  so do n't worry about greece too much , things can change very quickly . 
  it has n't even been 20 years and ireland an the uk have gone from a very similar relationship with a lot of distrust to ireland been closer to the uk than any other nation and vice versa . 
  so hopefully the same can happen with greece and macedonia . 
  compulsory irish comment : cromwell was a dick but queen elizabeth ii is ok , she came over for tea ... without an army and then invited us around for tea so we 're all good now .
