  did someone say potato ? 
  2014 q3 : ** +4.2 % ** 2014 q4 : ** +5.9 % ** 2015 q1 : ** +6.1 % ** 2015 q2 : growth continued and our economy is now larger than before the recession . 
  data out next week . 
  ** come on europe !, 
  get on our level !!!, 
  so germany is taking 800,000 supposedly , thats about 1 migrant for every 100 people . 
  which is a crazy number . 
  the uk is taking 20,000 , about 1 migrant for every 3,200 people in the uk so the uk really could take more . 
  ireland is now taking 5000 migrants or 1 for every 900 people in ireland which seems like a good number to start . 
  if every nation takes 1 for every 500 people in their population ( which i know is a lot to ask but not extreme ) the entire eu could absorb over 1,000,000 migrants . 
  the only problem is getting them to stay in certain countries . 
  today the irish pm is in brussels and is going to ask for ireland to be allocated even more refugees . 
  much more than our quota as public opinion here is now that we need to do more . 
  i 'm sorry but are you the raining six nations champions ? 
  did n't think so  and we will annoyed you left the eu so we will have to beat you [ this bad ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/159/404846965_426693af6b_b.jpg ) again in the rugby . 
  also this is as true for the world cup as the six nations https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbvbqpq4lxk, 
  as far as i know free trade , travel and all other agreements between ireland and the uk have already been drawn up so if the uk does leave they can be signed then and there so nothing between us changes . 
  your going to need those drinks after what we do to you today in the rugby, 
  no this is not a war of independence history site . 
  it 's a history of the ira terrorist scum who are trying to hijack the 1916 rising centenary . 
  sure we give a great ole ride we do . 
  just so you know europe generally likes obama but then again after bush ... 
  you guys love your flegs up there . 
  agreed, 
  while poland has been replacing the native population in ireland with it 's own we have been secretly taking over poland . 
  this is just the first step . 
  there 's only one way to find out !, 
  this means war !, 
  lebanon is the most well known middle eastern country in ireland . 
  this is because over 40000 irish soldiers have served there as peacekeepers making it the country ireland is most militarily active in ever . 
  47 of these soldiers have been killed in action while serving in lebanon . 
  the image of lebanon in ireland is actually good now even after losing so many troops . 
  i know a few people in the military and they all say going to lebanon was a great experience and the locals were extremely friendly . 
  yesterday ireland reported growth of 5.5 % so yes our economy is growing faster . 
  independent.ie / business/irish/economy-to-grow - by-55pc-this-year-goodbody-31447253 . html ( hope the link works . 
  i 'm on mobile ), 
  we did , we had jet aircraft but got rid of them as they were a needless expense . 
  we 're not very imaginative . 
  we just call it `` slaps '', 
  same in ireland, 
  just look at some of the stuff they posted on the embassy 's official twitter account . 
  are we not on reddit, 
  well in all fairness the israeli ambassador to ireland was sent here because he was [ sexually harassing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boaz_moda%27i#harassment_of_female_employee ) women in the israeli ministry of foreign affairs . 
  they could n't fire him so they shipped him off to dublin . 
  here he has called us a nation on anti-semitic people and racists . 
  he 's also posted several disgraceful images and messages on official israeli embassy social media here . 
  he has done a lot of damage to israels image in ireland . 
  hopefully they will send a better replacement to undo the damage . 
  i do n't think he deserves an official send off, 
  as a mayo fan i want us to win this year but at this stage after over 50 years i would sort of like the curse on the team to come true . 
  county carlow : does it really exist ? 
  i know the esa ! = eu but the eu makes up the majority of the esa 's member states . 
  we could claim it for the esa with eu support . 
  we 'll just have to carefully watch the canadians , there to close politically to the us . 
   legally we ca n't own the moon as a state we can claim it for the eu then since its not technically a state . 
  oh you mean the war you tried your best to ignore just like ireland until you were attacked ? 
   ally that supplies most of their military capabilities just so you know the us is not a military ally of either sweden or ireland and provides no military capabilities to either . 
  portlaoise is the highest security prison in the eu ( was used for holding ira prisoners ) and so you wo n't find much info about it online . 
  it 's even censored on google maps . 
  neither do we but their is n't real another word to describe it is there ? 
  one of the top posts ever on / r/ireland is about scotland the day after the referendum https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/2guh4u/how_everyone_is_feeling_this_morning/ we were a bit upset :( hopeing for a celtic union and all, 
  a huge amount of irish pubs across europe are run and owned by british people . 
  it 's usually easy to tell if it 's irish or british run.there was a story about it i read a few years ago , apparently the reason is irish pubs make much more money than english themed pubs . 
  you 've never seen summer in the uk or ireland have you . 
  i think we 've had a week or 2 at most this summer in ireland without wind and rain . 
  also a lot of our beaches are on the atlantic ocean where it 's windy as hell 24/7 . 
  could n't agree more . 
  the eu has transformed europe for the better in just a few decades and continues to do so . 
  yes i am, 
  they are currently commissioning 11 brand new ships . 
  1 entered service this year a second is entering service this week and the third is almost finished construction, 
  it not a thing any longer . 
  but until about 2 decades ago there was a lot of people whose parents and grandparents who lived through the conflict . 
  it has taken 2 to 3 generations for this civil war politics to die out . 
  the war of independence ended with the partition of ireland into northern ireland and the ` irish free state ' ( now renamed to just ireland ) . 
  this deal to partition ireland was accepted because irish forces would be unable to last more than another week or two of fighting ( the british did not know this ) . 
  anyway this decision to sign this treaty split the provisional sinn fein government into 2 sides the pro and anti treaty . 
  the anti treaty side left government and started the civil war . 
  the pro treaty side later won the war and evolved over time into the fine gael party while the anti treaty side evolved into fianna fail . 
  civil war politics had a huge impact in irish voting for decades but is no longer relevant other than to some very old age voters . 
  of all the pictures of noonan they could have used they use the one of him after his eye operation . 
  a few crazies in a nation of 4.5 million that ca n't let go of the past and have a very uniformed and bad understanding of our history for the last 100 years . 
  things can change very quick . 
  in ireland 5 years ago same sex marriage would not have passed a vote and this year what is supposed to be a conservative christian party held a vote to put same sex marriage as a right in our constitution and then introduced transgender rights . 
  in ireland we buy then in hardware stores, 
  i think ireland supported it because it wants unification at home and the uk objected for the same reason . 
  it was probably a decision based on domestic issues here and in the uk . 
  it had very little to do with germany . 
  yeah , but it 's 100 % accurate, 
  ireland only introduced postcode for the first time this week and made such mess of it all private couriers such as dhl and ups refuse to use it . 
  to post a letter in ireland you address it like this : mammy 's house mammy 's street mammy 's town ireland, 
  [ irish taoiseach enda kenny salutes queen in show of solidarity ] ( https://imgur.com/4bildyn ), 
  ireland is missing cork , galway and limerick . 
  all these cities have a population of over 100,000 . http://www.cso.ie/en/statistics/population/populationofeachprovincecountyandcity2011/, 
  your completely wrong here i 'm afraid . 
  the day enda responded in irish was a cultural day set aside since the early years of the state when all business in the dail is carried out in irish . 
  mick wallace knew this , a headset and translator was their for him but mick refused to use it . 
  we ca n't do it all at once , change takes time . 
  no fianna fail are now polling better than sinn fein . 
  also every prediction of the next election so far has shown a fine gael government again .
