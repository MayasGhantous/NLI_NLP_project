  if your grandparent was born in ** british ** derry , they 're northern irish and ** british ** like it says . 
  the other is irish , because they were born in the republic . 
  oh no , someone called me a west brit , i 'm not irish now . 
  fuck off wanker , just because someone has an opinion that agrees with 70 % of the population of ireland and 70 % of the population of the north , does n't mean i 'm anything , it just means i 'm a fucking realist who knows the situation far better than idiots like you who just dismiss opinions . 
  know why there was such a huge drive for unification that was especially strong during the 50 's up to the good friday agreement ? 
  study an actual irish academic history class , there was so much bullshit involved . 
  the northern ireland question was constantly brought up as a scapegoat for the absolute economic misery of ireland as well as very real bigotry up north against catholics that all culminated into a huge national sense of `` unification '' , despite the fact that there was a majority of the country that just did not want that and still do not want that , which includes statistically a fairly large number of catholics . 
  lots of people argue that we need to take it back . 
  there 's an entire population up there that absolutely does not want that , yet they 're always discounted in these talks . 
  so how about you fuck off with idealistic notions of what this nation should be and go read a fucking book and do some goddamn basic research . 
  yup , you 've yours and i 've mine , it 's all good . 
  yes , he clarified that in his next comment . 
  no chip , just refuting what you 're saying . 
  i ai n't a nationalist . 
  i really do n't care about uniting the two , i despise the ira after 1921 , i care about the unionists who are completely disregarded in most peoples discussions . 
  complete opposite . 
  also , arguing about meaningless stuff ? 
  you wrote to me , starting an argument that had no end and added nothing to anything . 
  it 's ridiculous to have you start something than turn around and state i 'm the one . 
  if you read my above comment you 'll see around 30 % of each side wants to unite . 
  the north is not as irish as me . 
  it 's not a fact . 
  it 's part of the uk , until its not , that fact wo n't change . 
  lol . 
  i have never in my life heard someone call themselves a nationalist and have a british flag represent them on here . 
  well done . 
  that 's quite a laugh , especially if you 're talking about the north . 
  mate , i really do n't care . 
  i 'm not being a dick , i 'm serious . 
  and ... 
  i am southern irish man if you want to put it that way , yes . 
  i 'm not being thickheaded about it . 
  i 'll talk small words . 
  he from north . 
  he 's part of uk . 
  live there . 
  not in republic . 
  law says he have passport from us . 
  he can have it . 
  still northern irish . 
  from north . 
  personally , i consider my friend who 's of nigerian descent , born here as irish . 
  if he was born in northern irish he 'd be northern irish . 
  i know about the agreement . 
  i 'm saying , he 's northern irish . 
  kindly kiss my arse . 
  what is someone from northern ireland ? 
  northern irish . 
  what 's someone from cork , donegal , dublin and wexford ? 
  irish . 
  it 's all well and good for you to identify as one . 
  i do n't think more needs to be said . 
  and there was a meeting that determined all northern irish people are not northern irish ? 
  you could talk in circles for days , but you 're ignoring the fact that you said yourself most of us do n't care in ireland . 
  we generally consider northern ireland it 's own country/state/whatever you would call an officially recognised border in the world with is own government , because that 's what it is . 
  i 'm saying i 'm not out to offend you , because that 's how it came across and several pms of others being very offended about things that were said politely and disagreed with them , because opinions that conflict ones belief are clearly bad ( s / ) made me think that , clearly i was wrong . 
  will do `` mate '' . 
  how nice . 
  yeah , you can be irish as a nationality and you can have a passport . 
  that 's allowed . 
  to us though , you 're northern irish . 
  i 'm not going out to offend you , i 'm literally stating a fact . 
  it 's an unpopular opinion , especially when the national mood is so high because of the 1916 rising celebrations , but no , you 're not , you 're northern irish , part of northern ireland , part of the uk . 
  just because you 're from derry and most likely catholic , does n't change that , no matter how strongly feelings are . 
  until a vote comes along , i do n't care . 
  if the people , in their majority , want to join , then i will . 
  i do n't want to impose anything on anyone . 
  ** e ** find it hilarious that there 's an amazing sentiment that we need to be united , a lot of people in my country do , but the fact is [ only 30 % in northern ireland want to be united and in ireland in some questions that dropped to 30 % also ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/prime-time-irelands-call-2426738-nov2015/ ) while catholics make up [ about 41 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_northern_ireland ) . 
  take that into account . 
  vast majority of these people grew up in the north , they have lived in the uk their entire lives , they have very little in common with people that live in ireland and it shows that a clear majority want to be there , including catholics . 
  but i 'm supposed to shut up , because clearly imposing a country over inhabitants that do n't want it is definitely a good idea and i 'm not allowed to state a fact , because i 'm not allowed to have an opinion , clearly . 
  they 're just people living in another country to me . 
  had a northern lad at a party last night and we talked at length about it . 
  basically they care far more than we ever will . 
  not to take away from it , but if that 's the case why is there such a huge interest from both sides in regards to israel and palestine ? 
  do you reckon maybe its one of those anomalys ? 
  my grandfather is from deep in the country . 
  i have to translate him speaking to people . 
  yes he is speaking english . 
  no that 's not irish . 
  he 's asking how 's she cutting . 
  irish here . 
  excellent students for the most part , intelligent , great mechanics and plumbers , work hard . 
  buff as fuck when it comes to the gym . 
  nice guys . 
  ca n't say i 've met a bad pole and i 've met a lot . 
  i thought it was banter actually haha . 
  i know you 're from sweden and have no sense of humour as a result , but this is typical irish british humour . 
  i find it funny that a bit of banter between two people was taken seriously by an idiot like you . 
  he was being humourous you cunt . 
  you do realise this was banter you absolute idiot ? 
  and i do n't drink with effeminate , closeted gay men with bad teeth , but there 's always a first time for everything . 
  how about we settle this over how much cups of tea we drink ? 
  i 'll drink you under the table . 
  can confirm , lots of croatians . 
  you did n't write enough to give that information . 
  from the context , these boys graduated and it looked like you said oh do n't punish them , coming across as an apologist . 
  are you stupid ? 
  if a boy rapes , thinks it 's fine to do and gets off free , he 's in a gang/group mentality , he 's going to continue to be a criminal . 
  if any native kids gang raped someone they 'd be put away .
