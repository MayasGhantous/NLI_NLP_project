  hahahahah , trying to twist the clear message here like that is kinda hilarious . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uzkrjsx.png ) the same map but done with a bi-polar color progression, 
  i agree , i think clinton was quite a good president , no doubts about that , but i still think he did a real shitty thing that hurt people close to him, 
  from reading the exerts , it seems he mean `` king '' as in the spiritual heart of the nation , like how many view queen elizabeth , rather than him trying to justify an emboldening of his executive powers, 
  that 's very interesting , thanks !, 
  can someone explain the difference between the eu parliaments in strasbourg and brussels to me ? 
  why two parliaments ? 
  beethoven 's 7th , second movement, 
  cheating on your spouse is fundamentally a shitty thing to do, 
  i 'm gon na admit i 'm fully given into the irish/british weather stockholm syndrome and say i prefer overcast and a cool breeze to clear skies and 25 \u00b0 + temperatures, 
  god the d\u00e1il looks a bit shite in comparison . 
  austria , can we borrow a few of your statues to fancy the place up a bit ? 
  the germans send their regards, 
  it 's not like the sky is gon na fall over this legislation passing, 
  and people being weirdly nostalgic about the idea of living in an era were they 'd probably be dead by the age of 35, 
  i will admit to it , and i commend the modteam for being some of the most energetic internet janitors out there, 
  i did not intend that . 
  nobody is attempting to interfere with your self-determination . 
  today is europride day , therefore the banner is the flag of the lgbt community . 
  the motivation starts and ends with that . 
  nobody wishes to , or is trying to force anything upon you . 
  i have no idea where this is coming from . 
  it 's europride day , therefore the banner is that of the lgbt flag . 
  nobody is stating there is anything wrong with being hetrosexual . 
  and of course you know i too feel strongly about this issue as well, 
  i am asking as a personal courtesy , to someone i 've known for around 2 years , to explain these posts . 
  as if americans could ever overthrow their government . 
  the rise of mechanised warfare in the 20th century put a swift end to that possibility, 
  expand on what you mean by these posts . 
   we can not allow americans to be more free then a continent on which democracy has been developed . 
  how does a right to bear arms make americans more `` free '' ? 
  be serious . 
  java what are you doing, 
  agreed,

  i 'm ashamed to admit i only have you on +17 java, 
  i was surprised there was no overlap until now to be honest ; i 've always expected the venn diagram of the two communities to overlap heavily,

  norway holding a similar level of eu integration as the uk , while outside the eu , is hilarious,
