   usa *** and russia *** seems you might have a bias . 
  is it not true that protesting was made illegal and things escalated from there ? 
  if the government had n't made it 's own peaceful citizens rebels and terrorists then they would n't be sheltering the bad apples . 
  the death penalty is disgusting but if i was going to be executed i would prefer a firing squad to lethal injection . 
  even hanging if it was done properly . 
  there was also the three year old who was crushed by a lift . 
  [ very tragic .

  these rating agencies are such bullshit , self fulfilling prophecy at its finest . 
  last i heard support was growing on both sides of the border . 
  does anyone havr any recent statistics ? 
  no offense ... but if you want to start a massive debate on the morality of some sort of political system you might actually want to know a bit more than assumed prejudices about it before you begin ... 
   legal equality you think that if the queen murdered someone she would n't be held accountable ? 
  i imagine she would a lot more than a rich white senator in the us would be . 
  having the sense to realise not every problem is solved with brawn i 'd like the most qualified person in the position regardless of gender . 
  * irish men who attempted to join a high class dating site for attractive people only were found to be third least successful at getting membership . 
  sample size , biased sample , etc etc. 
  all of your arguments are based on hypotheticals and `` i think `` s. police forces and militaries around the world have found roles for women and seeing as they probably know more about this and than we do i 'm inclined to believe women are more than capable to perform to the standard required . 
  there 's a fine line between apathy and asshole . 
  nah , you 're british !, 
  \\* ducks head *, 
  except those christians have political reasons rather than religious . 
  the whole catholic/protestant thing was just a means for both groups to identify irish from british . 
  it did became more than that but republican bombings are to do with politics not religion . 
  that flag has long since been bleached white by the sun . 
   you need me to provide a source that proves chuggers do what they do ? 
  hold on , i 'll head back to dublin , walk around with a camera , then upload it just for you . 
   not a single person who has ever walked through dublin would fail to know what i was talking about . 
  there is no need for a source . 
  you need me to provide a source that proves people were just as generous before chuggers showed up ? 
  hold on , i 'll head to any village in the country , chat to a few of the older residents , then listen to how everyone they know has been giving to charity for the last 60 years . 
  not a single person who 's lived in ireland since before the chuggers showed up would fail to know what i was talking about . 
  there is no need for a source . 
  interesting how you demand evidence for his claims but provide none for your own . 
  the british government can barely bring themselves to admit that they did anything wrong to the irish people , there is n't a chance they are going to prosecute anyone of rank over it . 
   e-textbooks can be acquired for a fraction of the price of printed ones , saving money , and can updated editions can be downloaded basically on a yearly basis well that would be true if the disgusting price of text books was actually due to the cost of printing them . 
  as soon as tablets become popular in classrooms the price of e-books will skyrocket . 
  just to play devils advocate , should we not hold the soldiers of a sovereign nation more accountable than some paramilitaries . 
  is it not possible that the fact that the british army acted in such a way and got away with their crimes caused even * more * violence in the north ? 
  gaelic is a family of languages including irish , scottish and manx . 
  while in a given context it could be understood as irish it does n't actually mean that . 
  most of the confusion comes from the fact that irish , in irish , is gaeilge ( gay-el-gah ) . 
  there 's a difference between some alcohol to numb sore gums and drugging children so you can use them to beg for money . 
  the cultural difference is pretty weird in that regard . 
  i had the misfortune to have to listen to one of my housemates describe her conquest of the night before . 
  some of the adjectives used after `` omg he was circumcised , i never saw one before '' were `` crusty '' and `` dry sausage '' . 
  i think he would prefer asylum . 
  i noticed too late , it 's gawker , do n't for the love of god give them page views . 
  for anyone wondering , it is a stupid editorialized headline . 
  an old guy wanked into the sea , was charged with sexual assault , was aquitted and some judge said something about masturbation being charged under disorderly conduct now . 
  move along , feel free to downvote the thread . 
  across the sky !, 
  well it tends to be handy when statistics are specific . 
  looks like they 're fishing for a default here . 
  apart from the winners . 
  i like to think the person in the right of the photo is like `` you rich fucker , i could have used that ... '', 
  it was produced by an irish company with irish actors for a british television channel . 
  * [ father ted !,

  * [ reeling in the years ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkqlrwrkmpa ) - awesome look at the history and pop culture of the country over the last few decades . 
  there is no actual narrations it 's all done through video clips of the actual events with a great soundtrack . 
  seriously check this one out if you 're interested in ireland . 
  - help me out here someone , i 'm not putting down fair city !, 
  it was more of an apology and observation than anything else . 
  i see you are living up to your username though . 
   foreign an national companies use luxembourg , gibraltar and ireland to avoid paying taxes . 
  irish business men also use spain to avoid paying taxes too . 
  you also have quite a lot of our drug lords in hiding .

  60m and i 'm suddenly living in beachfront property . 
  home rule was a bit of a pipe dream and even then it would n't have been true independence , we would be like scotland , wales or ni now if we went down that route . 
  the british were unlikely to be happy about a country with a grudge against them seeking independence in the middle of wwi . 
  india did n't even get their independence till 1948 and we do n't have the same scale of population to mount the unrest that brought that about ( not to mention that indian independence was also due to a lot of guerilla campaigns , not just gandhi . ), 
  we could have gotten our independence eventually by peaceful means but who knows how long it would have taken and the more integrated we became the chances of it happening would have gotten smaller and smaller . 
  i think the war of independence was the only way we could have gotten true independence before the 50 's at least . 
   collins was a terrorist . 
  one mans terrorist is another mans freedom fighter . 
   oliver cromwell ( bit of an odd one ; it would perhaps be better to say that he did heroic things than that he was a hero ) he was n't a hero , nor were his actions heroic . 
  every single one of his actions in ireland were disgusting and brutal . 
  he 's considered about as bad as hitler over here . 
  back when he was taoiseach bertie ahern refused to meet with tony blair because they were in a room where there was a picture of the bastard hanging on the wall . 
  he was nothing more than a genocidal murderer who decimated our population by nearly 2/3rds . 
  the penal laws alone are enough to cement his place as the single most hated person in the history of ireland . 
  not to mention the slavery , mass murder , destruction of culture and mass displacement of irish people . 
  maybe [ brian boru ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brian_boru ) too , the first high king of ireland . 
  was n't macedonia considered bum fuck sheep herder greece until philip though ? 
  so i am expected to be understanding of disgusting human rights abuses because ( and ireland btw has quite the opposite experience of colonialism than what israel is going through right now ) generations ago some european people were assholes ? 
  that is a morally indefensible position . 
  it 's probably the most competent to be fair . 
  i 'm just glad our politicians are too incompetent to really control anything . 
  there are 350 million americans spread across one if the largest countries in the world . 
  every american i 've met in ireland and abroad has been very friendly and polite .
