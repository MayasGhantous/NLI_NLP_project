  the problem is that they did n't do so in either way . 
  laws themselves , and the * application * of laws , are not the same thing . 
  you keep making statements that suggest you do n't appreciate the difference . 
  what the greens tried to do was use the claim that they were `` applying regulations '' to further a political agenda - but they were not in fact simply applying the law . 
  that was the basis for vattenfall 's case , and was found to be true . 
  hamburg were not at any point applying regulations properly and fairly - had they been , they would not have been found against . 
  all the `` blah blah rich people blah evil corporations '' does n't make a bit of difference to you being incorrect here , both in fact and in principle . 
  it just makes it clear that you do n't much care about what really happened , and do n't care much whether law is applied properly by governments as long as the result suits you . 
  unfortunately , it 's really kind of important that governments apply law * fairly * , not just when it suits politicians . 
   a court deciding years later that an isds panels made an incorrect decision does show the problem with isds . 
  no , the court did not decide that the decision was incorrect , because the isds decision was about discrimination , not about the legislation itself . 
   and in this case , do indeed show how isds hinder regulations from being written and enacted , in this case a coalplant was allowed to operate for years with sub-standard regulations . 
  clearly , if the regulations are implemented , there is n't a problem with the regulations being prevented by isds . 
  what hamburg failed to do in the moorburg case was act fairly according to the law . 
  they were sued by vattenfall because they did n't implement laws fairly , and they 're now being sued by the commission because they did n't implement them properly , as per the eu 's statement :  when authorising the plant , germany failed to carry out an appropriate assessment as required by the directive , and to assess alternative cooling processes which could avoid the killing of the protected species concerned . 
  that failure to carry out a proper assessment is a * further * failure by the hamburg government . 
  in the moorburg case , the greens in city government were n't applying law in a fair and non-discriminatory way - they used it to further a discriminatory political agenda to the detriment of a company they had an agreement with . 
  isds is intended for such situations , and operated correctly in awarding a judgement against hamburg . 
  but isds does not prevent the fair and non-discriminatory application of law , and can be seen here not to be applying in such a situation . 
  it was n't a question in the original of whether the law in question was a good law or not , or even whether it applied or not , it was a question of whether it had been applied fairly , and it had n't . 
  governments must apply law fairly - to support them when they do not simply because you happen to favour the particular arbitrary action in question is to support arbitrary government in general . 
  this is not the same thing as protectionism , though . 
  protectionism is n't a redistributive mechanism , it 's a subsidy mechanism for particular interests . 
  the redistributive mechanism in government-regulated capitalism is taxation , not trade tariffs . 
   the whole of eu should put large fees on chinese goods for instance , the reason their products are cheap is a combination of being shitty , their people being poor and working for little and them keeping their currency artificially low . 
  the eu does have large tariffs on chinese goods . 
  for example , the average tariffs on chinese solar panels for those chinese makers the eu regard as ** not ** being engaged in dumping are 47.7 % . 
  it also adds the point that isds is n't - as constantly claimed - a mechanism which hinders regulation for the common good . 
  here is a case where the same environmental regulations are being applied as caused the original isds case , but because they are not being applied in a * discriminatory * manner , they do not trigger isds proceedings . 
   plenty of companies have heavy investments in wind , for example well , again , since that c. 1.5 % of industry investment in renewables includes wind , `` heavy investments '' is obviously a very qualified term . 
  heavy compared to other players in renewables ( mostly startups ) , perhaps , but not heavy compared to their own investment in fossil fuels . 
   oil companies these days just see oil as part of their current portfolio but very few companies even see themselves as `` oil '' companies but rather as `` energy '' companies and want to be fully involved in whatever the future brings . 
  that 's fundamentally just those companies bowing to the inevitable - which they have nevertheless fought a long hard rearguard action against , and is still primarily an exercise in branding , to appear green to climate-conscious consumers as well as their own staff . 
  nobody actually * wants * to be the world 's corporate villain . 
  factually , though , the claim is largely bunk . 
  us-based oil companies , for example , invested $ 9bn in renewables 2000-2010 . 
  over the same decade * annual * investment in oil and gas extraction rose from $ 40bn in 2000 to $ 110bn in 2010 . 
  in other words , over the same period $ 9bn was spent by the oil companies on renewables , about $ 750bn was spent on oil and gas . 
  that does n't make oil and gas `` just ... part of their current portfolio '' . 
  it 's nearly all of their current portfolio ( 98.7 % ) , while they dabble a tiny bit in alternatives . 
   countries , which still rely on fossil fuel imports , espouse climate change acceptance to encourage investments in not so cheap and easy clean energy while lowering the price on fossil fuels . 
  `` espouse climate change acceptance '' ... compared with what the science suggests is necessary , no country does much more than pay lip service . 
  that 's why , 25 years on , the paris conference is still needed to make a decent ** start ** on limiting - not avoiding , just limiting - climate change . 
   this tradition , according to rams ' gr\u00edmur h\u00e1konarson , stretches all the way back to the old icelandic sagas and the descriptions of viking killing -- `` the heads fly off and the bodies split apart , '' he says . 
  `` that 's very funny , sometimes . '' there 's a line in njal 's saga ( icelandic ) where the rather psychopathic character skarp-hedin has just hacked someone 's leg off , and says to him `` there 's no need to look , it 's just as you think - the leg is off '' . 
  read the article preparing to be concerned about ttip increasing greenhouse emissions , ended up by being concerned about shoddy journalism . 
  the article constructs a horror story from flimsy material : 1 . two years ago ( under the previous commission ) the eu 's trade officials gave a briefing to energy industry reps - of which the content is apparently unknown - and asked for `` concrete input '' 2 . this is `` working closely with the fossil fuel industry '' , apparently - with the immediate assumption that the `` briefing '' actually consisted of the eu not only hearing the industry 's views , but immediately and uncritically rushing to ensure their realisation 3 . fossil fuel companies were then contacted to ask what their wish list would be , and it is then assumed that those would be the outcomes the eu would seek climate change is way more important than ttip , and undoubtedly the fossil fuels industry is a major player in poisoning the public debate about it with misinformation in line with their business interests , but this kind of shoddy scaremongering is playing the same game , which is both unnecessary and likely to be counter-productive . 
  the strength of the argument against climate change is that it is true - the claim that climate change is itself deliberate alarmism is a weapon in the denialist armoury , one that can only be strengthened by its use in this deliberately ( and shoddily ) alarmist `` journalism '' . 
  worse than that , i would n't even be sure that the agenda here is actually about reducing climate change - it seems more about stopping ttip , with climate change being pressed into service as a scare tactic . 
  that 's unacceptable . 
  foreign-facing ` news ' outlet in country reliant on fossil fuel sales for foreign earnings espouses climate change denial shock ... 
  it has increased over the last short while , but `` next to everything '' ? 
  no , not by a long shot :  early last year -- before the snowden revelations -- encrypted traffic accounted for 2.29 percent of all peak hour traffic in north america , according to sandvine 's report . 
  now , it spans 3.8 percent . 
  but that 's a small jump compared to other parts of the world . 
  in europe , encrypted traffic went from 1.47 percent to 6.10 percent , and in latin america , it increased from 1.8 percent to 10.37 percent . 
  http://www.wired.com/2014/05/sandvine-report/ next to nothing would be more accurate . 
   some encryption is vulnerable , encrypted messages will attract more attention . 
  cryptic encrypted messages would attract further investigation . 
  no , that makes sense . 
  the amount of encrypted communication is much smaller than unencrypted ( for now ) , and immediately suggests something worth investigating . 
  if the message content is also cryptic , that suggests something really worth investigating . 
  one man 's freedom fighter is another man 's bloody nuisance . 
   european leaders are naive , and had this strange idea that because they had achieved egalitarian , progressive societies , suddenly everybody else on the planet deserved a piece of it well , we 've always had the view that the rest of the planet should have some of what we 're having . 
   i believe as spaniard that bbc should remember what was life under terrorism threads . 
  call it ira or eta . 
  yep . 
  the reason there are no bins on the london underground is n't isis . 
   interesting . 
  i 've looked it up and in the eu only luxembourg and ireland have this kind of ratio . 
  and we 're both apparently rich countries somehow still getting net eu funding . 
   if the eu somehow clamps down on multinationals , i 'm guessing there will be a big adjustment in the irish economy . 
  maybe - but consider the current moves , which have led to the end of the so-called `` double irish '' arrangement ... and its replacement with a ` patent box ' arrangement which will have most of the same effects . 
  as long as most member states want to engage in tax competition there will be scope for creative tax arrangements that drastically lower the tax burden on multinationals . 
  any clampdown that hits ireland 's ability to engage in creative tax arrangements for multinationals also hits the ability of the other member states - and pretty much every member state wants that ability for themselves , so i do n't see a real clampdown happening any time soon . 
   where you guys moving everything around in wheelbarrows at the time considering the fact that you 're still catching up ? 
  pretty much , and economic mismanagement meant we did n't really do any serious catching up until about 20-25 years ago . 
  we would have become net payers in 2008 ... but , well , economic mismanagement again . 
  in addition , our gdp/capita is heavily affected by our foreign-multinational sector 's profits , which contribute less to our domestic economy than their earnings would suggest . 
  most countries gnps ( gross national product ) are 98-100 % of their gdp , ireland 's is about 80-85 % . 
  our eu contributions are based on gnp rather than gdp because the distortion is so large . 
  problem with parliamentary sovereignty plus majority government plus whip is that you 're effectively looking at government sovereignty . 
  always nice to see middle-aged entrepreneurs in the uk . 
   i think circumstances described in your exact fact pattern are fairly unusual i would n't agree - there are definite general patterns here , and they apply in a quite large number of real or potential cases . 
  a fossil fuel company knowing about climate change is one example , tobacco companies another definite case , and the principles apply to any situation where a company knows that the product/service it sells is harmful , but chooses to suppress that information or even actively misinform the public . 
  we have already very straightforward consumer law in respect of directly dangerous products , and the principle is both simple and clear - a company that knowingly sells a dangerous product is culpable . 
  the principle in the case of indirect harm is equally simple and clear , although proving such harm is more difficult . 
   so you 're not interested in existing disclosure obligations of listed companies ? 
  not to a disclosure obligation which relates solely to share trading , no . 
   what additional legislation would you like to see to cover this kind of case ? 
  i 'm interested in your thoughts on what sort of principles might be involved . 
  no , you had it more right originally , when you said you could n't imagine designing a law . 
   i ca n't think of any other legislation that would ** currently ** catch them . 
  that 's not what was under discussion :  i also ca n't really imagine ** designing ** a law to capture this kind of behaviour . 
  have another go . 
   if it were a listed company , then inside information rules would catch them ( on the basis that such information would be price sensitive ) . 
  that is a rather bizarre response . 
  price sensitive ? 
  inside information ? 
  you have the most peculiar approach to things .
