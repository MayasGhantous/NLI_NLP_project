  ( i just visited each year and it was something that came to my mind ) was all the fault of the cheap credit provided to them ? 
  this is the basic `` it 's the euro 's fault '' argument . 
  that even though the loss of control over interest rates at a national level was the single most obvious feature of the euro in advance , governments were supposedly entirely helpless to adapt in any way but snorting the cheap credit like free coke . 
  in ireland , we had some definitively mal-adaptive policy responses - tax breaks for property development and ownership , deliberately lax financial regulation , dramatic reduction of the tax base and shifting it from income taxes to windfall taxes on the property bubble , accompanied by huge padding of the civil service payroll and an attitude of throwing money at every problem , however small . 
  so a policy response was possible all right , but went the wrong way - taking all the crack cocaine and calling for more . 
  but we are supposed to forget all that , and blame the euro . 
  and probably re-elect the party who did it , too . 
  ... not as * much * . 
  ... but at least it 's not being undertaken simply because it 's popular with voters . 
  actually , i think you may be confusing government bonds with capital movement . 
  as for ` periphery ' , as has been said , that was hardly a eurozone effect . 
  iceland had exactly the same situation , despite not being in the eurozone , and expanding mostly into another non-eurozone country , the uk ( which also suffered a banking crash ) . 
  it 's rather more credible that the financial crash followed on from the wave of financial deregulation through the nineties , just as the previous financial banking crash in the thirties followed on from the deregulation of the twenties . 
  financial regulation has indeed been repeatedly identified as a major contributor to the bank problems in this crisis - but it apparently does n't suit some people to accept or admit that . 
  it sometimes strikes me that there 's two narratives to the financial crisis . 
  one is that laissez-faire financial regulation caused the problems , and that the solution is reimposing stricter regulation . 
  the other narrative is that the euro caused the problems , and the solution is to abandon the euro . 
  i ca n't help but note that one of these narratives suits the financial industry very well , and is also the narrative you invariably find being pushed very hard by any media associated with the city of london . 
  fortunately , the eu seems to have communally decided that the problem is more likely to lie with bank regulation . 
   what people do n't know is that it was german banks doing the lending , german banks had the highest amount of assets in ireland , and the second highest in greece and spain . 
  people actually do think they know that , but at least in ireland 's case , it 's completely wrong . 
  the total eurozone bank lending into irish domestic banks during the euro never topped $ 18 billion - that 's * all * eurozone bonds in * all * the domestic irish banks , including but not limited to the ones we bailed out . 
  the supposed exposures of german and french banks to `` irish banks '' had nothing to do with our domestic banks - those exposures were to their own subsidiaries in the ifsc . 
  nothing to do with our economy , nothing to do with our bank bailouts . 
  you do n't have to take my word for it either . 
  here 's philip lane ( tcd economist ) saying the same : http://www.irisheconomy.ie/index.php/2010/12/02/exposure-fears-for-irish-banks/ and here 's the actual data from the central bank of ireland : http://www.centralbank.ie/polstats/stats/cmab/pages/money%20and%20banking.aspx, 
  as maybe , but the convergence in rates you describe only happened after the euro launch . 
  you ca n't have it both ways . 
  the ecb creates stability , the national governments are then responsible for policy setting within the overall stability , as opposed to trying to set policy while also coping with instability . 
  ok , well , i hate to say it , but , yes , if you gave your son crack cocaine and a gun , and he took the crack cocaine and used the gun , then , yes , that 's his responsibility . 
  unless he 's not an adult , of course . 
  but that 's pretty much my point . 
  hate that !, 
  sorry to have only one up vote to give you for honesty on the internet ... 
  keynesian spending is a spending stimulus directly aimed at creating jobs - work programmes , government capital projects . 
  recapitalizing the banks is n't stimulatory spending , it 's a forced outlay required to keep banks functional as monetary and economic utilities . 
  no offence intended , but why use the term keynesian if you do n't really know what it means ? 
  particularly as a kind of derogatory epithet ? 
  it 's certainly not a keynesian response , if that 's what you 're saying ? 
  also , the keynesian response to a downturn is spending , not austerity . 
  cheaper credit does not automatically produce a bubble . 
  it 's necessary for the government concerned to treat the cheaper credit as a consequence-free money tree for that to happen . 
  irish governments responded to the availability of cheap credit by creating a mass of tax breaks for property development and property purchase , which had the effect of helping divert the cheap credit into the creation of a housing bubble . 
  they did nothing to try to divert that credit towards building or expanding indigenous businesses - instead , they created conditions where most irish smes bought into the property market , and are now burdened by negative equity . 
  cheap credit is not a bad thing in itself . 
  it becomes a bad thing when policy responses are inappropriate , as the certainly were in ireland . 
  what 's required is for a responsible electorate to elect governments with marginally more control than a two year old faced with a pile of sweets . 
  as to where the money actually comes from - there 's a popular myth that banks lend you other people 's money , and that therefore the money being lent out into the irish bubble `` must have come from somewhere '' . 
  this is n't what actually happens - banks create money by lending , and irish banks created most of the money they pumped into the bubble because they saw big profits in doing so , and we did n't have a regulatory regime that slowed them down , let alone stopped them . 
  the euro was n't the problem , our * response * to the euro was - but it 's easier to blame the euro than ourselves . 
  well , they must be doing a great job anyway - sure people are dying to get to italy . 
   tumba - pistil that separates pavement from the street ( i do n't know exact translation , neither does google ) could be `` bollard '' if you mean an upright post on the edge of the pavement . 
  if you mean the stone strip along the edge of the pavement , kerb or kerbstones . 
  if you mean the dip for water to run in , gutter . 
  that 's not particularly accurate , i 'm afraid . 
  the uk remains one of the world 's very few globally effective powers , and while it can no longer perhaps muster the force to invade entire countries by itself , there are few countries in the world the uk could not cause serious grief for , even in its kcurrent diminshed capacity . 
  that is true of only a small handful of countries , all of which sit permanently on the un security counil .

  there 's nothing particularly funny about the uk sitting on the un security council , when the uk is one of the world 's top military and economic powers . 
  just because the uk is no longer # 1 does n't mean it has dropped down to the status of third rate power . 
  it remains one of the world 's top powers . 
  hmm . 
  the last time that was tried was n't exactly a huge success ( although it was n't the disaster it 's often painted as either ) . 
  you could see the european council as the `` board of governors '' of the eu - setting directions etc. 
  given that the member states write the treaties , that 's a pretty accurate reflection of their role . 
  as for `` so many councils '' - people often add the council of europe in there , particularly in the uk , where little or no distinction is drawn between that body and the eu . 
  most of the issue you raise is n't really an issue - frankly , you could sort it out by renaming those posts as bezbojnicul says . 
  or one can just bear in mind that despite the word `` president '' , bezbojnicul 's versions are what they actually mean . 
  the idea of transferring all powers to the ep does n't fly , though . 
  it appeals because `` it 's more democratic , innit ? 
  '' , but what would actually be achieved is turning the ep into a european government by default , without first creating a european demos , and robbing the member state governments of their reason for creating and supporting the eu in the first place , when they still control and provide 80-90 % of `` eu '' functionality and all of its funding . 
  as delenda_east says , it argues an almost complete misunderstanding of what the eu is , what it 's there for , how it functions , and of its constitutional architecture , which as it is currently designed balances pretty well the need for it to serve the interests of the european governments ( who are themselves elected representatives of their citizens ) , the european project and its sub-projects such as the single market , and the european citizen directly . 
  irish - less speakers than you . 
   to acknowledge that security and geopolitics involves power and the ability to project power does not make you a nationalist . 
  it makes you a realist . 
  not really . 
  there 's a difference between accepting that there are balances of power - obviously there are - and seeing balances of power as an acceptable system of international relations . 
  as delenda_est says , that model has led to catastrophic failures . 
  in a sense , it 's not unlike the free-market models , which tend to do the same , but the consequences of balance of power busts tend to be a good deal * boomier * than financial busts , if you see what i mean . 
  yeah , the social consensus in prenineties ireland was n't exactly a great outcome . 
  amateurs . 
  indeed , not thinking war is a good way of resolving issues in the first place . 
  neither have i , i 'm afraid . 
  assuming they 've transposed the legislation , which they should have done , then yes . 
  no , the guarantee is already in force . 
  people do n't necessarily know it , and that includes people working in businesses and shops . 
  no , the guarantee is already in force . 
  people do n't necessarily know it , and that includes people working in businesses and shops . 
  in the uk it 's six years under the sale of goods act 1979 - well , england six under that law , scotland five under a similar scottish law . 
  you may be offered a one-year `` commercial guarantee '' , but that 's in addition to the eu 2-year guarantee and the uk 's 5 or 6-year guarantee . 
  i do n't think the article suggests that putin 's actions in ukraine are either acceptable or the result of the us acting as if it had won the cold war . 
  what it says is that as a result of those earlier decisions , the same kind of diplomacy that ended the cold war is not an available option . 
  and that is true , and a regrettable outcome of earlier mistakes , and it does have implications , negative implications , for how the ukraine crisis will unfold . 
  hmm . 
  french and luxembourg meps voting against . 
  and quite a few german meps , too . 
  i 'm betting they 're from western , particularly south-western , germany . 
   the eu parliaments travelling circus even the eu parliament - perhaps particularly the eu parliament - do n't want this . 
  but the french do . 
  the advantage of strong , charismatic leaders is that they can appeal to the masses and get things done their way .
