  * this argument is not based on anything - at all , mind - in the studies , but solely on you using a dictionary ( rather badly ) i 'm pretty sure you know that 's wrong . 
  i 'm certain i do . 
  nevertheless , i 'm also certain you 're going to keep insisting you 're right , so i might as well stop pointing out that you 're not . 
  although when i say `` stop '' there , i should add the qualification `` in this exchange '' , because i would n't want you to think that i 've stopped for all time . 
  i 'll obviously still point it out whenever i see you claiming the `` chilling effect '' is real . 
  that 's the difference between `` stop '' with and without the qualification , after all - and you know it perfectly well . 
   when politicians/civil servants say we have to wait and see the outcome of a case before we proceed you ca n't claim something is on the agenda either . 
  of course you can . 
  if legislation is being drafted , and is planned to be put before parliament , then it 's on the legislative agenda . 
  it means it 's going to turn up at some point in the near future - that the government is still clearly intending that it happens . 
  if legislation gets delayed for a period , it 's usually said to have `` fallen down '' the legislative agenda . 
  dropping off the legislative agenda involves the government having no apparent intent to have it go ahead . 
   it 's not a fallacy when you use the words wrong , and try to claim your wrong interpretation proves you 're right . 
  you claiming legal chill does n't mean deterring when it 's literally what is means it 's just you being wrong and me trying to educate . 
  you 're just trying to use a dictionary to hit me over the head and win a claim you have been able to provide no other basis for at all - i mean , let 's be clear , you 've been completely unable to show anyone writing about `` regulatory chill '' and including any measures of delay in their study , so you 've been reduced to saying that the dictionary says that a word used in their definitions * can * mean that . 
  it 's not even as if i 've claimed it ca n't - i 've just pointed out that for it to mean that , you have to add a duration . 
  dictionaries are n't guides to usage , and this is a usage issue . 
   and claiming all papers world wide who talk about the deterring effects of legislation/isds only mean it in the way you interpret it . 
  well , yes - because if they meant delay they would include delay in their study , and none of them do . 
  i 'll make the point again - you can not have the phrase `` delayed but not prevented '' or `` delays but does n't prevent '' , both of which are in regular use , if `` delay '' and `` prevent '' are synonymous in the way you claim . 
  using `` prevent '' without a time period does not mean `` delay '' - it only means `` delay '' when used with a time period . 
   except many would consider not passing a law for 5 or 10 years for no apparent reason abandoning it . 
  perhaps , but nobody applies the term to laws that have remained actively on the legislative agenda for a few years to be `` abandoned '' , because by remaining on the legislative agenda they clearly have n't been . 
  well , maybe not `` nobody '' - presumably you do . 
  and campaigners may use the term emotively , of course . 
  but you wo n't find people saying that ireland/norway etc have `` abandoned '' their plain packaging laws , because they have n't . 
   you should really stop and read the defenition of words instead of assuming they mean what you think they mean you should really stop trying to win arguments by referring to the dictionary . 
  it 's a logical fallacy : [ argumentum ad dictionarium . 
  ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/argumentum_ad_dictionarium )  the basis for that joke is that stop has multiple meanings that are used interchangeably . 
  just like prevent or deter . 
  the word does n't have `` multiple meanings '' - its use is contextual . 
  without an implied or explicit period it means `` stop indefinitely '' . 
  you 're trying to make one sense of it be another , but the two senses are easily distinguished . 
  to have `` prevent '' mean `` delay '' you * have * to qualify the word `` prevent '' with a duration . 
   and in delaying them they prevented plain packaging ** for an extended tie period ** . 
  which is the best they can hope for . 
  see , here we are again . 
  to make it clear that you mean `` delayed '' when you say `` prevented '' you have had to add the period of prevention , and have done so . 
  if we do the sentence without it :  and in delaying them they prevented plain packaging . 
  we can very clearly see that it implies that they 've managed to put plain packaging off the agenda indefinitely . 
  you can not construct a sentence where `` prevented '' means the same as `` delayed '' without adding ( or implying ) , as you had to above , a time period . 
  that 's why the phrase - the * commonly used phrase * - `` delayed but not prevented '' exists . 
  qed , i 'm afraid . 
  feel free to go on arguing , but let 's be clear that you 're wrong , and you 're only arguing because you ca n't admit it . 
   article from 2012 , government officials said it way before that not by any source i 've seen or that you 've provided - they all say that norway ` supported ' australia 's introduction of plain packaging laws , in 2012 . 
  what i can find is stuff like this :  the australian government intends to introduce plain packaging from 2012 , and other countries such as the uk ( ukdh ,2008 ) are currently considering such an option . 
  plain packaging is under discussion in norway , ** but is not yet on the political agenda ** . 
  that 's from an article published in 2013 - [ nicotine & tobacco research 15 ( 2 ) ( 2013 ) ] ( http://www.hera.helsebiblioteket.no/hera/bitstream/10143/302277/1/scheffels250913_perceptionsofplain.pdf ) - although more likely it was written in 2011 . 
  you 're welcome to claim facts , but you need to back them up . 
   sure they ca n't directely , but they can fine the contry extraordinary ammounts unleess they law is overturned . 
  you know this . 
  it is n't a fine , it 's an award of compensation . 
  the distinction is important . 
  and the `` extraordinary amounts '' are largely theoretical - the largest award is probably occidental v ecuador ( $ 1.77 bn ) , which is also as far as i can see the only award over a billion . 
   but id did in other countries . 
  as far back as 2012 norway , ireland , india , uk were publicaly supporting plain packaging , none have it yet . 
  except , again , ireland has no isds treaties , so isds can not be a reason for delay in ireland 's case - despite which , the delay in ireland is the same as the others . 
  plain packaging has also been subject to domestic cases , the most important of which is the uk case , which has just finished . 
  so the assumption that all these delays are isds-related is just that , an assumption . 
   but it is , there is no use in you simrly ignoring dictionary defenition to fit you argument . 
  when authors say laws were prevented , they are usually referring to laws that were prevented for a time . 
  i 'm sure you can provide sources for that . 
   and not happening includesm , `` not happenig for a time period '' . 
  a law can not be said to be prevented if a government has announced its intentions to make such laws , and has proceeded from there to the law without at any point abandoning it ( or significantly watering it down ) . 
  and that is the case for all the laws we 've talked about . 
   otherwise no laws can be said to have been prevented as they might pass at some point in the future preventing something `` indefinitely '' ( that is , without an implied or explicit period ) is not the same as `` permanently '' - that things might change in the future is an expected and implied part of `` indefinitely '' . 
  all that is required is that what has been prevented is no longer on the calendar . 
   you think delays arent part of the chiling effect , because it smahes your world view that the chilling efect is not real . 
  i think it because nobody else but you includes delay as part of the chilling effect . 
  you 've completely failed to show that they do - all you 've done is insist that they `` do really '' even though there 's absolutely no evidence for them doing so . 
   when authors talk about isds cases having a chilling/deterring effect they obviously inlude delays . 
  no , that 's only if we redefine the words they use to include that meaning , which nobody but you is doing . 
  no , really . 
  your argument that authors mean `` delay for a period '' when they say `` prevent '' has no support at all . 
  you 're relying on a specious claim that dictionary definitions of the words they use can be bent to include delay by claiming `` prevent '' is the same as `` prevent for a specified time '' . 
  as i 've pointed out repeatedly , the latter construction is a proper one , but * only with the addition of a time period * - and nobody is using it that way . 
  all you need is a couple of respectable sources who state that `` prevent '' includes `` delay '' , and you have none . 
  you just keep insisting on it being real , without evidence , because , to quote you , it `` smashes your world view '' that there 's no evidence for a major plank of anti-isds propaganda . 
   similarly , world like stop , or prevented will cover both `` tempererarly stoped '' or `` stopped indenfently . 
  you are saying people obvioslu only mean stopped indefenetly when they say stop . 
  other they would have said stopped temporarily the use of words like ` stop ' without a time period does indeed imply stopping indefinitely . 
  you can see that , for example , in the idea of `` stopping smoking '' . 
  if i say `` i stopped smoking '' , then the implication is that i have stopped smoking indefinitely , without the intention of doing so again . 
  uses of words like stop and prevent come in three forms - with an explicit duration , with an implied duration , or indefinite . 
  in addition , all include the idea of abandonment of an action/activity . 
  that is , in fact , the basis for jokes about stopping smoking , like `` it 's easy to stop smoking - i stopped smoking at least 10 times yesterday '' . 
  the same goes for statements like `` i 've stopped drinking/driving/visiting my family '' - again , the implication is of indefinite stopping and no further intent , and adding something like `` until next time '' makes the claim a joke . 
  similarly , a question like `` did you stop your friend from drinking '' can only be answered with a single affirmative `` yes '' in cases where either the stopping is of indefinite duration , or the drinking is of definite duration . 
  you can either have stopped your friend from drinking since the point when you started doing so , or the question can relate to a particular occasion , such as a party , in which case the duration is by implication that of the party . 
  if you really only stopped your friend from drinking for a week , or for the first half of the party , then to simply answer `` yes '' to the question is deceitful - you need to add the duration of the effect . 
  turning back to the idea of preventing the enactment of a law , you can not simply answer `` yes '' to the question `` has x prevented the government from enacting this law '' unless either there is a duration already under consideration ( `` this year '' , or `` on this occasion '' ) , or the law has been prevented indefinitely . 
  it is very obvious that as far as philip morris is concerned , the isds cases have not prevented plain packaging laws , but only delayed them . 
  just to hammer the point home , let 's look at the phrase `` delayed but not prevented '' . 
  let 's do a google search for it and see whether that 's a phrase that gets used . 
  after all , if the words mean the same thing , as you claim , the phrase would be meaningless , right ? 
  [ surprise !, 
  it 's a very common phrase .

  you ca n't say something is `` x but not y '' if x and y are the same thing . 
  so , clearly , they 're not .
