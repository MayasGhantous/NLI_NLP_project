  the council ( so , the * elected * ms governments ) have always held the final say over eu legislation , so ` democratisation ' actually means giving the parliament more control over eu legislation . 
  but more control for the parliament over eu legislation means less control over legislation for the member state governments . 
  it 's actually a transfer of power from the national level to the supra-national level - and that is something which many people object to , and indeed characterise as ` undemocratic ' . 
  the whole argument about ` democratisation ' therefore stumbles over two different conceptions of what is actually democratic . 
  the only thing on which the two different democratisation forces agree is on taking power away from the ` undemocratic ' commission , but there really is n't any power to take , because the commission has very little real power - as the article points out , the vast majority of legislative is * already * in democratic hands . 
  the true question is not * whether * it should be in democratic hands , because it already * is * , but * whose * hands it should be in . 
  it 's also important that the member state governments write the treaties which transfer their power to the parliament . 
  they are cautious about doing so not only for the obvious reason of losing their own power , but because the european parliament is necessarily an ongoing experiment , and because past a certain point , the parliament becomes capable of * taking * power - as was seen in the spitzenkandidaten process , which was a political coup by the parliament , allowed by most member states , opposed by the uk . 
  would n't meet the criteria for entry . 
   look into the provision of direct proton chemo and not allowing any countries to provide other that america ... come back to me ok , i 've searched all the leaked ttip documents , and there is no mention of either proton chemotherapy or chemotherapy at all . 
  where does this claim come from ? 
   she wants to make a `` informed decision '' but ignores anything that suggests remain is the better option . 
  ah , well , that 's the debate in a nutshell . 
  still , surely the idea that the immigration situation is quite possibly * worse * not better with brexit should have some impact . 
  just repeat `` if anything , brexit will make the immigration problem worse '' a few times ... it might have an impact in the voting booth . 
   she wants borders back in the eu so people can not be smuggled across 1 border , walk freely across it ... as well potentially get smuggled into the uk since borders would make it harder . 
  the eu countries , even in schengen , have the power to control their borders - so , for example , there are immigrants stopped at the italian-french border , having come in by boat to italy , and wanting to cross france heading for the uk . 
  the power to do so was n't really an issue before the current migration crisis , but borders are being firmed up . 
  the uk also has the power to stop people entering - otherwise there would n't be immigrant camps at calais because those people would be in the uk already . 
  brexit does n't remotely solve your mum 's problem , though . 
  the uk leaving the eu does n't create borders anywhere else , and the uk already has the border control to stop immigrants at calais . 
  even with the uk outside the eu , immigrants will still be able to cross italy and france to reach calais if that 's the arrangement between italy and france . 
  on the other hand , with the uk outside the eu , nobody will be arguing the uk 's case for preventing that happening . 
  on the contrary , immigrants that make it to the uk having crossed the eu are no longer an eu problem . 
  as a non-eu country , the uk 's borders would become entirely a uk problem - eu countries would n't have any reason to assist the uk with preventing people smuggling , and the uk would be outside the various eu arrangements for detecting and preventing people smuggling . 
  i 'm not suggesting that french and other eu border control and police would stick their heads into the back of a van full of illegal immigrants and say `` everyone here for the uk ? 
  great , good luck , on your way '' , but the uk 's border problems will not be an equal priority any more . 
  so , while hopefully brexit would n't actually make the situation * worse * , it really offers nothing that makes it better . 
  better than that . 
  you can never * prove * that something has no negative impacts - you are , literally , asking to prove a negative . 
  so no paper to date has found that gmos have health impacts ? 
  they just have n't looked hard enough . 
  deaths from nuclear power , even nuclear accidents , are next to zero ? 
  only so far ... 
  annoys the tits off me , as a green . 
  and yet , one of the big reasons irish politics do n't fit the standard left-right mould is because our two main parties actually follow broadly that ` ethnic ' cleavage in irish society . 
  i 'm quite serious about that , btw - for example , this paper : http://www.kevinbyrne.org/pubs/byrneomalley2013b.pdf, 
  to be fair , it 's not a case of the `` no true scotsman '' fallacy . 
  that it allows us in modern times to waive any moral responsibility for the irish part in the british empire is a happy accident , although you can see how it stems from a country achieving independence from that same empire . 
  these are the same leaks as before ... ? 
  as you can see , we ( or at least a good chunk of us ) do n't acknowledge those people as irish , even if they were born in ireland and considered themselves irish . 
  a bit like being english but blaming the british empire on , say , ` normans ' - after all , a fair chunk of the irish ascendancy were norman in origin too , and were in ireland not much less time than the normans in britain ( maybe 200 years less out of nearly 1000 ) . 
  nationalism likes simple ` truths ' and national homogeneity - independent ireland was constructed on the basis of a ` nativist ' mythology and identity which basically excludes the previous elite as ` un-irish ' , despite their strong role in brining about independence . 
  and that constructed identity is sufficiently strong for this to be a highly unpopular point of view even now . 
   please excuse me if i can not provide specific citations at this point . 
  it would be somewhat more excusable if it were n't a very common claim . 
  in fact , the only visible evidence suggests that `` some economists '' asked by the economist at the time thought that not joining the euro * might * reduce the uk 's attractiveness to fdi - a total of one economist was quoted as suggesting that , ian wooton of glasgow university . 
  the majority of economists asked did indeed `` favour '' joining the euro , but none of them seem to have stated that the uk 's economy would `` collapse '' - they just thought it would add a pointless cost to retain a floating exchange rate with a major market when the option was there not to do so . 
  other sources ( [ for example ] ( http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/british-politics/what-are-the-arguments-for-and-against-joining-the-euro/ ) ) seem to have been then quoting the economist . 
  thanks for that !, 
  the ep debate would have been on the original `` connecting europe facility '' as part of the budget . 
  the various points at which the parliament would have been involved can be found with a [ site-limited google search ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?num=100&amp;newwindow=1&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;q=%22connecting+europe+facility%22+site%3aeuroparl.europa.eu&amp;oq=%22connecting+europe+facility%22+site%3aeuroparl.europa.eu&amp;gs_l=serp.3...277.5365.0.5684.24.17.0.0.0.0.143.1092.5j5.10.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..14.0.0.67mbaq_dsji ) . 
  variously : * [ committee stage approval ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20131007ipr21607/connecting-europe-facility-committees-approve-infrastructure-funding-mechanism ) * ep brief : http://www.europarl.europa.eu/regdata/etudes/brie/2015/565903/eprs_bri ( 2015 ) 565903_en . pdf ( pdf ) the decision on which projects get funding would n't be debated in the parliament , it 's delegated to the connecting europe facility coordination committee and signed off on by the commission . 
  however , there 's a parliamentary assessment of the facility available from earlier this year , so it may come up for debate again : http://www.europarl.europa.eu/regdata/etudes/idan/2016/572677/ipol_ida ( 2016 ) 572677_en . pdf ( edited to make links work , because some of the ep links have parentheses in them , which breaks reddit 's link formatting ... ), 
   and at what point said background does n't matter anymore varies wildly . 
  some people are well integrated in the 2nd generation , some still are n't in the 35th . 
  there are people whose entire genealogy is english who do n't integrate well with english society . 
  it 's just that nobody tries to explain their failure to integrate by pointing to an ` immigration background ' . 
  i think part of the problem is that the political class are looking at the standard indicators - gdp , etc - and that those indicators do n't tell you what people are experiencing . 
  unfortunately , i do n't see that as something that will be solved by brexit . 
  it 's a counterpoint to a common tangle of leave psychology , which can be summarised as : * the eu lacks influence in the world * the uk lacks influence in the eu so * the uk will be better able to resist globalisation/have more influence outside the eu his point is that while the uk in the eu may * feel * it lacks influence , this is nothing compared to the lack of influence it will actually * have * outside the eu . 
  the uk is a big economy within the eu , but it 's a minnow on the new global stage - sure , it 's the # 5 economy , but japan is the # 4 economy , and because japan acts alone it has next to no influence globally . 
  and my father is 85 , and has held his opinion on the eu for at least 30 years . 
   but this is such shit . 
  your opinion of my opinion noted . 
  i shall endeavour to treat yours with the same consideration . 
   why were n't the lenders who gave the money to greece forced to take the loss ? 
  they did - there was a $ 100bn write-down forced on the private lenders . 
  were you not aware of that ? 
  they have already been bailed in , back in 2011 . 
  greece had to recapitalise its banks as a result ( and borrowed to do so ) , since a lot of the private lenders to greece were greek banks ( and cypriot ones , which cyprus had to recapitalise ) . 
  that write-down was 50 % of the value of bonds held by private creditors . 
  yes , the amount could in theory have been doubled to 100 % , but then the creditors would have fought it in the courts , because holding government bonds is n't like putting $ 5 on a horse at the bookies - you get all kinds of legal safeguards and rights . 
  and yes , you could simply strip those away by decree , but in doing so you make government bonds everywhere ( and especially in the eurozone ) a much less attractive investment - which puts the price of borrowing up for * everybody * , at a time when all governments are heavily in debt . 
   somewhere some foreign institutions are slowly being feed eu tax payer money , the greeks only get to hold it for a little while . 
  no , greece is being fed eu tax payer money , in order to keep up repayments on the money it already borrowed and sustain its deficit . 
  i do n't know why it does n't get mentioned , but greece is not running a balanced budget , let alone a surplus - it does n't even have a primary surplus . 
  that means it needs to borrow to pay for existing borrowings * and * to pay for government spending . 
  greek debt has increased again since the original rescue because their finances are not sorted out , and despite the howls , austerity measures have not cut greek government spending to match government income - it may in fact be impossible to do so , because cutting government spending cuts government income . 
  the greek economy is still contracting . 
   the greeks ca n't get anything from the eurozone , they showed that when they had their standoff and referendum , back when varoufakis still rode his motorbike to press conferences . 
  if they ca n't get help when they need it so desperately , then what reason do they have to stay in this community ? 
  the love of foreign banksters and pensionfund buffoons ? 
  because they do n't have any other options . 
  their debt is not sustainable , and neither is their government spending , even after drastic austerity cuts . 
  the eurozone is n't as generous as greece would like , but nobody else will give them anything at all . 
  the only thing keeping greece afloat at all is the eurozone . 
  i do n't think you really appreciate how badly fucked-up the greek economy is . 
  if it were a company , it would have been forced into bankruptcy several years ago and wound up , and a lot of people would be in prison for cooking the books , because it was actually bankrupt long before that . 
  but it 's not a company , it 's a country , so it ca n't actually be made bankrupt or wound up . 
  but it can become extremely poor , and the options are to be rather poor with eurozone support , or * very * poor without it . 
  that 's why greek governments that get into office on opposition to their bailout deals change their tune within a month of assuming office . 
  from the sidelines , it 's possible to pretend there 's some magical way out . 
  from the driving seat , it 's clear that there is n't . 
  what you 're basically saying is `` this is a shit lifeboat , greece should jump into the sea '' , as if being on your own in the water is somehow better than being in even the most poorly equipped lifeboat - * when you ca n't even float * . 
  and you 're calling for debt relief , when nearly all greek debt is owed to eurozone taxpayers . 
  now , i do n't object to the idea of ireland ( and by extension , me , as an irish taxpayer ) giving greece debt relief , even though ireland is n't in a great financial position itself - i would vote for it at referendum - but i really object to anyone calling for it when they do n't understand that that 's what 's involved . 
   why ca n't a greek government pull the plug on something ? 
  because there is nowhere else to go . 
  there is no deal or situation which is better than that on offer from the eu .
