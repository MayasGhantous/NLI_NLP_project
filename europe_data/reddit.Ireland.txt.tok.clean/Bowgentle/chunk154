  others `` engage in debate '' to shock , annoy , upset , etc. 
  ( please do n't try to characterise these as `` not true debates '' or `` not true debaters '' , since that would be adding the `` no true scotsman '' fallacy to the existing begging of the question - they are the * real * debaters , and the * real * debates . ), 
  people do not tend towards truth , and debate does not tend towards truth . 
  people tend to what is persuasive , and debates are won by persuasive speakers/ideas . 
  the human brain is not a truth-discovering device , language is not a truth-discovering tool . 
  i do n't really know how anyone can believe these things . 
  well , i do , of course - they 're persuasive . 
  unfortunately , they 're also wrong - human reason has n't evolved to reason our way to truth , but to persuade . 
  there are methods which can compensate for that deficiency , of course , pre-eminently the scientific method . 
  and i would have absolutely no objection at all to free speech under scientific scrutiny . 
  but the majority of people do not apply scientific methods in the marketplace of ideas - they apply a variety of convenient heuristics , biases , and received prejudices . 
  as such , most of what 's traded in the marketplace of ideas is false coin , knock-offs , snake oil , and outright lies , as is the case for any unregulated market . 
   i said that it tends to prevail via discussion . 
  if a government can ban speech that it does not like , then you run a risk of having a positive feedback loop where a government gets into power that does not like some idea , restricts discussion of it , and tends to shift the debate further away . 
  that is a danger , but a much small one than you suggest . 
  you 've had to use the example of an autocracy to illustrate it , rather than a democratic government , even though democratic governments do have the power to limit freedom of speech . 
   i do n't think that there 's any more basis for saying this for saying that `` freedom of expression was intended to be an absolute right '' -- that is simply an assertion . 
  you 'll find that freedom of expression * is * limited where it is enshrined in law , by the same laws , by the same legislative bodies . 
  unless the restrictions were some kind of bizarre and repeated accidents , they 're clearly part of the intention that the right to free speech enshrined in law is not absolute . 
  that 's not to say one ca n't believe in free speech as an absolute right , just that it has never been legally enshrined as an absolute , because legal systems have to deal with the real world , in which people are neither perfect nor perfectible . 
   there is n't another way to do proportional representation that makes any sense . 
  a shout out for pr-stv here !, 
  no list system , no threshold . 
   if you permit free speech , you rely upon the mechanism that in the marketplace of ideas , truth tends to prevail . 
  it seems to me that that works reasonably well . 
  there is no real evidence for this assertion , i 'm afraid . 
  it 's just a statement of faith . 
   if you disallow that , you have to have some mechanism for determining which ideas are goodthink and which ideas are badthink . 
  presumably your government determines that . 
  my own view is that the government currently in power is not a very reliable mechanism for coming up with what the list of `` correct '' ideas to hold are . 
  in a democracy , that contradicts your previous assertion . 
  the government is produced by election , elections are held in the marketplace of ideas . 
  if your belief that truth tends to prevail is correct , the government that gets elected should reflect that . 
  if , on the other hand , you prefer to claim that elected governments do not reflect the marketplace of ideas , it 's hard to say what the value of that marketplace is supposed to be , and likewise freedom of expression . 
  freedom of expression was not intended as an absolute right - it is limited in many ways . 
  rights are rarely absolutes - they are theory , and must bow to pragmatism . 
  this does n't actually work . 
  people whose ideas are `` driven underground '' may go on thinking them , but they 're aware that their ideas are not broadly acceptable - they are less likely to air them publicly themselves , and they 're unlikely to act on them . 
  people whose ideas are given air time give other people the impression that these ideas are ok to have . 
  those who are like-minded are thereby strengthened in their convictions , and those who might not have come to those ideas are introduced to them . 
  those who would hold them anyway become more likely to act on them , in the belief that they 're doing something that will be viewed positively . 
  people are first and foremost social animals . 
  social acceptance or rejection of their ideas strengthens or weakens the attraction of them . 
  most people believe what most people believe only because most people believe it . 
  sure , you might believe that by allowing those ideas free expression , they 'll find themselves shouted down in the internet 's ` marketplace of ideas ' by other people and changing their minds , but that 's not what happens . 
  first , those people will find a nice filter bubble , and will only venture out of that refuge to cross swords with those who they see as ` the enemy ' - people are not persuaded by their enemies , and if they have a refuge where they will be praised/consoled for their battles , very much less so . 
  instead of people testing their ideas in the marketplace , you have zealots and crusaders backed by refuges of the like-minded . 
  places like stormfront negate the idea that the marketplace of ideas has the value of shining a light that disperses dark ideas . 
  second , if those who share such ideas organise - again , places like stormfront , the chans etc - then those people are capable of creating an impression of much greater numbers than they actually have , in addition to their zealotry . 
  again , that 's persuasive for people who otherwise would n't be persuaded , and eventually for media figures and politicians who can get to believe there 's a support base available . 
  third , a lot of the ideas of concern are basically authoritarian ideas - and authoritarians respond very strongly to approval/disapproval by established authority . 
  some ideas are , quite simply , bad ideas . 
  they 've been road-tested extensively , the results are in . 
  we know that nazism is a very bad idea , and we also know that it 's a seductive one . 
  same for racism , sexism , climate change denial , and several others . 
  we do n't need to let these ideas run around freely and do their thing , and we should n't naively believe that because they 're bad ideas nobody will be persuaded - if nobody was persuaded , there would n't be anyone promoting them , yet there they are . 
  you do n't give a cancer a free hand in the belief that because it 's aberrant it will somehow be eliminated by ` healthier ' cells . 
  compared to national parliaments in their own country , sure . 
  but the ep almost certainly gets more coverage in each member state than do the parliaments of * other * member states . 
  i ca n't recall the last time an irish newspaper covered the doings of , say , the finnish or swedish parliaments . 
  that 's reasonable enough - ireland has 11 resident meps all looking for press coverage , and no resident members of the finnish or swedish parliaments . 
  to be fair , it 's more a case of coverage . 
  if half the stupid things said in the irish parliament were reported internationally , it would look a lot worse than the ep . 
  well put . 
  you 're rather ignoring the fact that germany 's in 2014 is ** up ** from 43 % in 2004 , ireland 's ** up ** from its low of 44 % in 1994 , france ** up ** from 41 % in 2009 , netherlands ** up ** from 30 % in 1999 . 
  there is no pattern of continued overall decline , and just picking first and last gives a distorted picture . 
  but , hey , your story is your story . 
  that 's the overall average as reported in the media . 
  the details are as i have given them , derived from national turnout reports . 
  you 're welcome to the figures if you want them , and can check them for yourself . 
   no the falling voter turnout has been a thing since the beginning , unrelated to new additions . 
  very slightly , but no more . 
  for the eu-9 , it started at 66 % in 1979 , dropped to a low of 55 % in 1999 , and has risen since to 57 % . 
  for the eu-12 , it started out at 66 % in 1979 , and has been steady at about 55 % since 1999 . 
  for the eu-15 , the first full election in 1999 had 53 % turnout , and so did the 2014 one . 
  the accession states came in with an average of 31 % turnout in 2004 , rose to 32 % in 2009 , and fell again to 28 % in 2014 . 
  as i said , it was the addition of the accession states with low turnout that lowered the all-eu average , not a continued fall in the turnouts of countries already voting . 
   this is evident from voter turnout not really . 
  voter turnout in the `` old eu '' countries for ep elections is a small but steady amount below that for national elections , and is not falling . 
  the gap is reasonable - the ep has less effect on day to day life than the national parliament . 
  the overall fall in average all-eu turnout is the result of the addition to the average of the ex-communist countries , which have very low turnouts for ep elections . 
  that 's hardly surprising , since these countries are less integrated with the eu , and national politics still has the post-independence fire one might expect . 
  surely no more necessarily messy than , say the uk 's system , with a scottish , welsh , and northern irish assembly as well as the westminster one . 
   tad straw man there to be honest , no one opted to not have access to the single market theresa may decided it not really a straw man , because theresa may is the pm . 
  the media largely appear to be going along with what she 's doing as well . 
  that 's `` the uk '' as far as everyone outside it is concerned . 
  not sure . 
  am trying to help with upvotes !, 
  pretty much feels like you 're at the end of the world there . 
  nothing but sea ahead of you . 
  we do hear as much now about chinese companies as we used to about us companies . 
  we do hear as much now about chinese companies as we used to about us companies . 
  you know that * you * can report this ? 
  the fraud notification system ( fns ) is a web-based tool available to any person who seeks to pass on information concerning potential corruption and fraud : http://ec.europa.eu/anti-fraud/olaf-and-you/report-fraud_en, 
   the most obvious thing for me is the legal system . 
  our common law legal system is very different to those of nearly all of europe . 
  it 's perhaps worth pointing out that the uk is not legally homogeneous , nor the continent - the continent has three different systems of civil law ( napoleonic , germanic , nordic ) and scotland uses a combination of civil law and common law . 
  meanwhile , ireland uses common law , but does n't think of itself as not being european in the same way england and wales appear to . 
   keep in mind we have countries like canada , the us , nz and australia who have extremely similar cultures and the same languages to us . 
  i do n't deny the attachment , but is it actually much more than sentimental ?
