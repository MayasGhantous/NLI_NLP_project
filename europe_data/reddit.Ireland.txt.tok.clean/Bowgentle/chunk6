  at least one jar of them in the fridge , need more soon . 
  i do n't think there 's an irish dumpling . 
  soda bread . 
  ah , well if you want a * defence * of it , you 'd need someone who believes it !, 
  darwin could easily be considered a form of theistic evolutionist himself : `` there is a grandeur in this view of life that the creator breathed into several forms , or into one , the breath of life , and these have gone cycling on , giving rise to forms most beautiful and most wonderful to behold . '', 
  from the conclusion of `` on the origin of species '' . 
  the process is natural , but `` guided '' in the way all natural events are , by being part of god 's ineffable plan , and with god having started the whole ball rolling . 
   and , therefore , if britain just reduced the numbers of people who can move to britain from continental europe , it would n't change the principle either . 
  yes ...  no . 
  just that ukip 's immigration policy would result in a more ethnically diverse set of immigrants into the uk . 
  follow the * same * logic in both cases . 
  not really , given those people can already immigrate to the uk . 
  increasing the numbers of them does n't change the principle . 
  are you really trying to tell me that ukip are in favour of increased immigration ? 
  because that * would * be news . 
  those are pretty bizarre criteria . 
  there 's no such thing as a writ of habeas corpus in scotland , while identity cards are suggested at various times in all jurisdictions , including the uk . 
  while you 've carefully picked australia , other anglosphere countries do have identity cards - either non-compulsory ( as canada and the us ) or compulsory ( as south africa and singapore ) . 
  if you 're going to pick and choose what makes countries compatible , what makes your set of criteria universally valid or otherwise important ? 
   also , ukip want to favour ties with and immigration from the commonwealth ( this obviously has a much greater `` range of people '' than the eu does . 
  uh-huh . 
  so ukip would be in favour of substituting free movement from commonwealth countries for free movement from eu countries ? 
  i do n't think that 's actually the case . 
  if you were to set up a test where immigration was more open to countries which shared a set of common values - democracy , free press , sexual/religious tolerance , etc - that 's discrimination still , but not on a basis of nationality/ethnicity . 
  country x is not being discriminated against simply because it is country x but because it does n't share an adequately similar set of values - if it is judged to adhere to those values at some future point it will no longer be discriminated against . 
  funnily enough , there * is * such a set of values , and such a set of membership tests . 
  and , interestingly , one can take farage as knowing that . 
  i do n't `` mind '' whether it 's the case or not , and i 'm not sure why i should do so ... ? 
  so ... `` political resistance '' and `` dirty tricks '' = people joining other groups ? 
  ukip claim to have formed efd by overcoming `` political resistance from across europe '' and a `` nasty dirty tricks campaign '' . 
  anyone any idea what he 's referring to ? 
  or is this just more `` ukip , the party * they * do n't want you to vote '' thematic rhetoric ? 
  they both have very minor representation in the non-english parts of the uk , and it 's only `` growing significantly '' in the sense of a small increase on tiny being relatively large . 
   ukip 's definition of `` us '' is british nationals , whereas the french socialist definition of `` us '' is eu nationals . 
  i 'm not really sure why one is `` narrower '' than another , is it just based on the fact that one has more people than another ? 
  contains a greater range of people , although your attempt to reduce it to an absurdity of numbers is entertaining at least !, 
  you 're simply trying to squash everything into a racist/not-racist dichotomy , when i have rather strongly made the point that it 's a spectrum . 
  i 'm * not * saying that ukip are racist , and others are n't - i said ukip are * more * racist because their definition of `` us '' is narrower . 
  i 'd still see ukip as fundamentally english party , much as the tories are - and their vote in scotland is of a similar scale . 
  i do tend to forget about wales !, 
  ukip pursue a more limited immigration policy , so yes , by the earlier logic that 's exactly the conclusion . 
  eh , they 're fundamentally an english party . 
  yes , all such divisions are racist/xenophobic , and it 's only a question of degree . 
  ukip are more racist/xenophobic than other parties . 
  having said that , it 's possible to have immigration restrictions which are n't either racist or xenophobic . 
  open borders between , say , an economically complex and socially diverse rights-based democracy and an monocultural oppressive theocracy is going to result in a flow of people who might not be entirely ready for life in the more complex society , and who are likely to be a problem . 
  no , ukip 's main policy plank is immigration , at least for its supporters . 
  that comes clearly out of all the research and polling . 
  leaving the eu is a related issue due to freedom of movement - and has the handy feature that you can talk about eu immigration , which lets one pretend that one 's opposition to immigration is n't about brown people and the like ( well , except where those brown people are romanians , of course ) . 
  immigration is always a racist/xenophobic issue . 
  you either think of people as `` people '' and see them all as having the same rights and worth , or you mentally divide them up into `` people of my nationality and others '' , `` people of my ` sort ' and others '' , `` people of my cultural background and others '' etc , and assign rights and worth on that divided basis . 
  immigration is only an issue if you follow the latter way of thinking - and guess what ? 
  that 's racism/xenophobia . 
  you can dress it up whatever way you want , but it 's still dividing the human race into `` them '' and `` us '' , and assigning us more privileges than them . 
  you can even have a sliding scale , like nige does , where germans are ok , and romanians are n't ( and we all `` know the difference '' , apparently ) , so that you can claim that the fact you 're prepared to classify * some * foreigners as `` pretty much ok '' means you 're `` not a xenophobe '' . 
  but history 's classically racist systems did exactly that , whether dividing coloureds from blacks , or '' octoroons '' from `` quadroons '' , or accepting the brits as `` ubermensch '' . 
  ukip may not be the bnp , but their electoral success is built first and foremost on dividing the world up into `` them '' and `` us '' , and ascribing greater worth to `` us '' , while ascribing `` our '' problems to `` them '' . 
  that 's not even arguable . 
   there 's no politics , just shouting and making loud noises so they can appear as the good guys to the most ignorant people and everybody else is corrupted . 
  it sounds like that english party ... four letter acronym...uk-something-something ... tip of my tongue . 
  reckon grillo would get along well with them . 
  if only i could remember their name !, 
  no , being a mild racist makes you a mild racist . 
  it 's distinguishable from wanting to leave the eu , which is merely a political position . 
  `` spilled your juice '' ? 
  disturbingly phrased ... 
  this has possible implications for the eu-us safe harbour agreement , which basically says that us data protection is acceptable under eu privacy law . 
  the agreement was last updated in 2000 or so , and has not been amended in any way to take the snowden revelations on board . 
   what is he going to do , organise a second referendum ? 
  a more referendum-y one , with extra referendumness . 
  or , perhaps , one in which the tories do n't campaign for staying in . 
  or , more realistically , campaign for staying in in an even more lacklustre and divided way than they will anyway . 
   it would n't be enough for me personally however !, 
  that 's unexpected !, 
  to be fair , though , our protocols regularly have to be replaced with new protocols saying the same thing for exactly that reason . 
  when there is n't actually a rational reason for concern , it 's hard to address the concern . 
  but , but it 's not a * british * reform . 
  so it does n't count . 
  that would at least be funny , and a recognition of the uk 's special paranoia . 
  and as an irish citizen , i ca n't really grudge that , given the several protocols we 've had appended to the treaties to cater for our own paranoias . 
  would a protocol noting that `` ever closer union '' as a form of words has no pre-determined federalist outcome do ... ? 
  unlikely , i think - it 's a very specific group of people who have a paranoia about it , and they 're not really numerous enough to make it worth replacing with some form of words that 's less elegant . 
  you might just have to face the idea that if there were sufficient support for a federal europe , the words used will certainly not prevent that happening . 
  in the absence of sufficient support , the words will not make it happen . 
  `` ever closer union '' does n't imply anything other than what it says - that we get ever closer together . 
  that is , grow together as a team or couple does , get to know each other better and better , work together better . 
  there 's no specific political outcome . 
  once again david cameron shows he has the sure political touch of marie antoinette . 
   mind you i am not lord and master of the english language but in my book your interpretation is contradictory . 
  i do not consider it entirely fair to come to your conclusion . 
  i can appreciate that it seems that way , but it 's like asking me whether i support the idea of `` moving the local playground along the road towards ghent '' and claiming my `` tend to agree '' allows you to move the playground all the way into ghent , when i 'm thinking of at most a kilometre or two . 
  there is no contradiction , only a problem of badly defined meaning . 
  and indeed that 's one reason people can be sceptical of federalism - it 's the old saying `` give them an inch and they 'll take a yard '' . 
  my `` inch '' is support for `` more europe '' , i do not support anyone taking the `` yard '' of a federal europe . 
  i 've had brits get extremely rustled about not having every single island of that archipelago lumped into being `` british '' so i am supposed to be playing it safe here , clearly i have failed . 
  ah well , sorry about that . 
  it 's exactly because the brits ( specifically the english ) tend to refer to `` the british isles '' - in a proprietary sort of way as if ireland still belonged to them - that the irish have a problem with it . 
   would n't it be wonderful if eurobarometer simply asked `` do you support the idea of your nation joining with other willing nations into a european federation ? '', 
  frankly it would be marvellous if they just asked the same questions regularly . 
  but yes , the `` evolution towards a federation of nation-states '' question is particularly woolly .
