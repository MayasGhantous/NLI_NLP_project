  that the boards of quangos are political appointees is generally regarded as pretty unacceptable ( ireland has about 5,000 quango board seats , half of which are in the direct gift of ministers ) , but at least quangos are n't usually in charge of things like granting building permits . 
  so , no , this would n't actually fall under the category of corruption , it would only be corrupt if it had been done for monetary gain , rather than political gain . it is in fact a part of normal practice - and suddenly isds makes more sense , particularly since in this case the state government was the same party as the main federal government party , and vattenfall apparently had no joy at all attempting to resolve things through central government . 
  i agree that that it * feels * like corruption to me . 
  when the irish greens were briefly ( and as it turned out , disastrously ) in coalition government from 2007-2011 , the minister for the environment was a green td who had been elected with a mandate to prevent the building of an incineration plant . 
  he did try to find a legal route out of the contract , but ( a ) there was no suggestion that compensation would not be due if he did , and ( b ) it was n't by anything as underhanded as changing the permit requirements . 
  ffs france , sort your shit out . 
   i do n't mind this for contractual matters , but for matters dealing with quantative restrictions and measures of equivalent effect , i 'd rather it were dealt with by a public court set up to represent the deal as a whole , not a private one . 
  a bit like the european court of justice . 
  so would i , but that actually does impact sovereignty rather more . 
  veolia successfully suing egyptian government for raising minimum wage . 
  ok , so - excuse the long reply : ** veolia ** 1 . the case has not in fact been settled - hardly surprising , given it only started in 2012 . 
  so any claim veolia have been successful is false . 
  2 . the case is a contractual dispute . 
  veolia has a joint project with the city of alexandria - a landfill gas recovery project supported by the world bank as part of greenhouse gas emissions reduction . 
  the contract contains a clause raising the compensation for veolia if costs increase - veolia says that the increase in minimum wage increased the costs of the project ( it also says the city police failed to prevent the massive theft of dustbins by the local population ) . 
  what veolia is suing for , then , is breach of contract by the government . 
  it 's not suing for the overturn of minimum wage legislation - it is looking for compensation due to it under the contract it has with the city on a project to reduce alexandria 's emissions , and which the egyptian government is not willing to honour . 
  that the increase in project costs came about through the minimum wage legislation is basically irrelevant , and this is not a case of veolia suing for lost profits either .

  1 . there are two vattenfall cases , not just one . 
  one is settled , one is not . 
  the big case is the second one resulting from germany 's decision to abandon nuclear power by 2022 , and not only is it not settled , an arbitration panel has n't even been agreed as yet . 
  the two cases are being conflated by campaigners . 
  2 . the smaller case was , again , a contractual dispute - hamburg had contracted with vattenfall in 2007 to construct a coal-fired power plant ( not a nuclear one ) . 
  the company had originally planned a smaller plant , but was encouraged by hamburg to expand their plans to a larger one . 
  hamburg set certain environmental conditions for impact on the elbe by the plant as part of a preliminary permit for construction . 
  vattenfall proceeded with construction on that basis . 
  4 . when the final permit was issued 11 months later , the environmental conditions in it were of sufficiently different character ( much more restrictive ) to render the whole project unviable , according to vattenfall . 
  vattenfall sued on the basis that the decision to make the conditions of the final permit much more restrictive was taken for purely political reasons - the plant 's construction being hotly contested locally . 
  hamburg claimed on the contrary that the additional environmental restrictions were part of its ongoing attempt to meet the standards of the eu water framework directive . 
  6 . arbitration supported vattenfall . 
  first off , the water framework directive had not changed in the period between the preliminary and final permits , so the argument that the final permit was the result of trying to meet obligations under the directive ring very hollow . 
  what * had * changed was the head of the permit-issuing authority ( the new one was a christian democrat politician and senator ) , and it was agreed at arbitration that the imposition of a level of environmental requirements sufficient to render the project unviable was a deliberate political act to prevent it going ahead . 
  the final permit was amended in the direction of the preliminary permit as settlement . 
  vattenfalls ' request for arbitration is here : http://www.italaw.com/documents/vattenfall_request_for_arbitration_001.pdf as a green myself , i 'm perfectly happy to see a coal-fired plant prevented from construction - however , i think it 's also clear that the way in which it was done was wrong . 
  vattenfall had made an investment on the basis of a legitimate expectation that the final permit would be similar to the initial permit , and the change between them was done on a vote-seeking basis by a local politician . 
  i have no objection to politicians seeking green votes , either , but if a company has entered into an arrangement in good faith , arbitrary and underhanded termination for political reasons is not acceptable . 
  ** vattenfall 2 ** 1 . this is the big case , with vattenfall suing for lost investment in nuclear plants . 
  the case is a long way away from being settled , and details are so far a little vague . 
  2 . the basis is that in 2010 the eleventh amendment to germany 's atomic energy act sanctioned additional energy supplies that would extend the life of germany 's nuclear plants by eight to 14 years ( lifetime extension ) . 
  vattenfall , on the basis of that legislation , invested in its nuclear plants in germany . 
  vattenfall will likely argue that it has not been treated fairly and equitably , as it had legitimate cause to assume that the legal extension of 2010 would remain in force . 
  based on this expectation , the company invested in nuclear power plants . 
  according to the company , vattenfall has invested some $ 700 million in the two nuclear power plants kr\u00fcmmel and brunsb\u00fcttel in recent years , with the belief that these reactors would be taken back into operation . 
  it 's worth pointing out that german nuclear companies are also suing the german government , and the entire nuclear industry in germany is of the opinion that the decision to phase out nuclear - particularly so shortly after the 2010 amendment extending the lifespan of nuclear plants and expanding their role - was purely an emotional and populist response to the fukushima disaster . 
  the case is n't even really started yet , so it 's hard to say what the outcome will be . 
  it 's different from vattenfall 1 , where the hamburg government had clearly encouraged vattenfall to build , and then a new head of agency had made a clearly and entirely political decision to stop the plant . 
  ** philip morris **  ongoing dispute in australia by cigarette firm trying to sue australian government for passing law to remove branding from cigarette packages . 
  1 . these guys are complete weasels . 
  2 . again , the case is not settled , so again a claim that it has been successful is false . 
  what action there has been so far has been in australia 's favour : 3 . 
  the permanent court of arbitration decided last year that australia will be allowed to challenge philip morris asia 's right to contest their plain packaging laws , on the grounds that the company only bought shares in its australian arm so that it could launch the case - australia believes the fact that philip morris asia only acquired its shares in the australian company 10 months after the government had announced it would implement plain packaging means it does not rightly fall under a trade agreement we have with hong kong . 
  4 . see 1 again . 
  again , we do n't know what the outcome will be here , but it seems more than likely that philip morris do n't expect to win , only to drag proceedings out and attempt to put other governments off following australia . 
  this is an obvious attempt to use an isds mechanism to ` chilling effect ' , but if the case goes against philip morris it may well have the opposite effect . 
  a good summary : this is a textbook case of alleged regulatory expropriation . 
  there is no direct taking , but there is an obvious restriction of the claimant 's right , based on public policy purposes . 
  whereas expropriation for public policy purpose is never unlawful per se , it requires compensation ( not just under the bit , but also , for instance , under protocol 1 of the european convention of human rights ) . 
  the case will therefore hinge on whether the effects of the plain packaging act are expropriatory ( under art . 
  6 of the bit ) . 
  from : http://www.sidi-isil.org/sidiblog/?p=1360 ** general ** what should be obvious from this wrap-up is that the cases being cited as * successful * ` anti-state ' actions under isds are all actually still in arbitration , and certainly have not been settled in favour of the companies . 
  even the claim that vattenfall have been successful through isds relates to a different case than the one to which its name is linked . 
  only in philip morris ' case is what is sought a reversal of legislation , and , well , frankly , those guys are weasels . 
  they 'll come at the moves against tobacco from every angle they can think of , as well as some which probably came as part of the whole trading their souls to satan package . 
  i do n't think they 're a good reason to oppose something whose uses are * generally * much more reasonable . 
  hard cases make bad law , as they say . 
  there is a general principle underlying all of these - everyone agrees that the state has the right to legislate , but what is at issue is the question of whether , when they legislate to someone 's detriment , that someone is entitled to compensation . 
  as a general principle , i personally support the principle that they do - that governments may pass legislation , but may not do so without compensating those affected by it . 
  i suspect that most people would agree with that principle , as long as the compensation is fair and proportionate . 
  i also suspect that proponents of the scare stories know people accept that principle , which is why they concentrate on claims that isds prevents states from legislating ( which it has n't ) or that the compensation involved is excessive . 
  in respect of the latter point , the claims are based on maximum * estimates * of the compensation that * might * be * claimed * by companies ( preferably multinationals for extra non-sympathy ) in cases which have not actually been settled at all , and are made without any reference to the amounts the companies may have actually lost . 
   their analysis may be right , but there are no practical solutions they can offer . 
  that 's the problem . 
  austerity sometimes looks like churchill 's quote about democracy - `` austerity is the worst solution to a crash , except for all those other solutions that have been tried from time to time . '', 
   yep , and once the treaty is open for democratic scrutiny it will be too late to change anything of it , let alone turn it down . 
  no , it will be released in advance of the votes on it , and meps have access to the negotiations on an ongoing basis . 
  it will be voted on by 29 national parliaments ( i 'm including the us houses ) and the european parliament before it can be ratified . 
  where do people get the idea it 's not going to be voted on ? 
  if it comes to it , the commission is negotiating on behalf of the eu governments , and reports back to them at each stage . 
  if you have an issue , communicate it to your government . 
  meanwhile , the european parliament holds votes setting out what it considers acceptable in ttip - again , contact your mep . 
   the ttip would provide business with the ability to contest some political decisions which affect their sales in a special court . 
  while it is potentially interesting , ensuring that political favoritism is not a concern , it will probably be out of small business possibilities ( financially speaking ) to call it , and it opens the way to a global lowering of standards - like labor and environmental laws - because `` it hurts business '' . 
  this is the supposed `` chilling effect '' , about which much has been said . 
  i say `` supposed '' because despite its importance , i 've not seen anyone showing it to have happened . 
  the size of actual awards in isds cases , as opposed to the original claims for compensation , tend to be of the order of $ 10m , a figure which government cockups routinely cost without any apparent effect on their willingness to continue making cockups . 
   why would we agree to possibly worse rules written by china or russia ? 
  it wo n't be a case of agreeing to them - it will be a case of companies preferring to comply with chinese or russian standards and not bothering with eu or us ones , because within a decade or two , china will be a market of 800m affluent consumers ( assuming current trends continue ) as opposed to its current 100m . 
  it 's no coincidence that ttip would create a ` common market ' the size of china 's projected market . 
   also , it introduces a law which allows companies to directly sue a country in private international courts if they 're unhappy with how these laws have been applied . 
  this represents an extraordinary shift in sovereignty from democracies to private capital . 
  no , it 's in 1400 free trade treaties negotiated by eu member states over the last 50 years . 
  it does not allow a company to sue `` if they 're unhappy with how these laws have been applied '' - they can sue only for compensation , and only on the basis that a government decision is discriminatory against a foreign investor . 
  most isds cases are basically breach of contract cases , where the national government have entered into a contract with a foreign firm , and then unilaterally changed the terms or broken the contract . 
  awards tend to average out at about $ 10m , which is not anywhere near enough to put a government off such actions , and isds actions involving general legislation rather than administrative decisions almost invariably fail . 
   even italy is backing this , it 's not northern europe vs the south anymore . 
  although it kind of was until greece went on a charm offensive . 
   my argument is that those products and chemicals are banned for a reason . 
  if the product safety standards remain the same in the eu , ttip will have literally no impact at all and there would n't be a point to it . 
  no , that 's not the case .
