  i strongly suspect it 's deliberately so , since your question would , i think , produce a much smaller `` overall agree '' figure . 
  yep . 
  and he 's not going to let it go , either . 
   you did n't use the word `` meaningful support '' , you used the term `` preference '' . 
  come on now , you do n't think `` tend to agree '' equates to a `` preference '' ? 
  well , no , not really ( sorry ! ) . 
  i 'm not just doggedly defending a bad choice of words - like i said , i 'm in the `` tend to agree '' category , but would oppose a `` federal europe '' . 
  and i think this comes back again to the question of definitions . 
  i have no problem at all with the idea that there are more people in favour of `` more europe '' than are opposed to it - even during the crisis , and despite all the noise about euroscepticism , that 's been a steady preference . 
  what i have a problem with is the idea that this equates to support for a federal europe . 
  it does n't in my case , and while you could call that anecdotal , it 's actually meaningful , because it means that the category of people who answer `` tend to agree '' to the question about `` evolution towards a federation of nation-states '' includes people who are opposed to a federal europe . 
  unless i 'm unique , that means you can not use `` tend to agree with the idea of evolution towards a federation of nation-states '' as a proxy for `` preference for a federal europe '' . 
  which leaves the question of how one can `` tend to agree with the idea of evolution towards a federation of nation-states '' while opposing a federal europe . 
  easy enough - i support going some way down that road , some way along that path of evolution , and stopping before we get to a federal europe . 
  the definition of `` federal europe '' i 'm using here is probably the tricky bit . 
  what i mean is an eu whose `` federal centre '' is constitutionally and/or practically no longer subject to the member states . 
  also ... it 's best not to refer to ireland as part of the british isles , in conversation with irish people . 
  i do n't mind personally , except that you seem to have lumped europhilic ireland in with eurosceptic uk . 
  we are taking different things away from the data . 
  i simply do n't see the `` very small minority '' that you do given that if the states with  50 % will to federalize suddenly did , the resulting state would be the largest in both population and gdp of europe ( ~ 4 trillion euro , 127 million population , which gives a gdp/capita of israel ) . 
  well , like i said , i do n't see `` tend to agree '' with the statement `` the eu should develop further into a federation of nation-states '' as meaningful support for federalisation . 
  i very definitely would n't see it as `` will to federalise '' - it might be describable as `` probably tolerant of increased federalisation , depending '' . 
  i 'd be in the `` tend to agree '' category myself , and i oppose the idea of a `` federal eu '' . 
   and 110 support the spinelli group . 
  which is about 14.5 % , the same distance the other side of that 11 % . 
  this is one of those questions which is bedevilled by the issue of definitions . 
  a `` federation of nation states '' is a hugely vague concept which does , as you say , have some support - vague concepts often do . 
  if you count `` totally agree '' plus `` tend to agree '' as `` support '' , then this particular vague suggestion has support of 44 % overall ( 11 % totally , 33 % tend ) . 
  i admit i would not in general accept `` tend to agree '' as `` support '' or `` tend to disagree '' as `` opposition '' . 
  and even on that basis there is nowhere with a `` super-majority '' - the countries where ( total + tend )  50 % are czech republic ( 55 % ) , france ( 55 % ) , cyprus ( 54 % ) , austria ( 54 % ) , poland ( 63 % ) , and slovakia ( 52 % ) . 
  i guess if you excluded the do n't knows as well as counting both `` total '' and `` tend '' as support , you could claim better figures . 
  personally , i 'd only accept the `` totally '' on each side as `` support '' or `` opposition '' respectively , because `` tend '' does n't translate into political action . 
  on that basis i 'd say the idea of even so vague a form of federalism as `` developing further into a federation of nation-states '' has 11 % support across the eu . 
  looking at the recent elections to the ep , we find that 62 meps have signed a [ federalist pledge ] ( http://www.moveurope.eu/newly-elected-meps-who-pledge-to-support-a-federal-europe/ ) , which is 8.25 % and very much in line with the eurobarometer 's `` totally agree '' . 
  what confuses the matter is support for further integration ( in some areas , where desirable ) , which is much wider , and opposition to a united states of europe , which is not actually something that fits under `` a federation of nation-states '' . 
  anyway , does that answer the question ? 
  yes , i know what you 're doing , and what you think you 're doing - you 're attacking a wilful ignorance which is n't there because you 've mistaken the discussion of a political point for ignorance . 
  like i say , you 're concentrating on the disrespect being shown to a fetishised object - and ignoring the way such fetishisation enables the use of such objects for propaganda purposes entirely at odds with their origin . 
  not very unlike what happens with the us constitution , or indeed the bible . 
  if it were at all likely that cameron intended to use the magna carta to make the point that the arbitrary exercise of power by the executive is something that can be successfully fought , and which * must * be fought if people are to gain or retain rights , you would have a point . 
  unfortunately , that is not likely , and you 're missing the author 's point by concentrating on his `` disrespect '' for the magna carta . 
  the author is not opposed to the restriction of executive powers by laws granting rights , and is unlikely to be unaware or disapproving of the magna carta 's historical significance in that respect . 
  if the magna carta can be used as a propaganda tool that supports the status quo - and it can be , has been , and will be here - then it needs to be disrespected as a fetishised document . 
  your difficulty with that is alarming , particularly as a history buff , because it demonstrates the emotive force of the historical significance of the document itself as part of the status quo . 
  and propaganda is all about emotive force , about fetishisation of this kind - your arguments here demonstrate very well how difficult it would be for history teachers to resist this particular exercise in propaganda . 
  not really . 
  i think you 're focusing on the , er , ` disrespect ' being shown to the magna carta rather than the point the author is making . 
  which in some ways rather demonstrates my point about the dangers of fetishisation . 
  the magna carta is essentially an irrelevant historical abstraction which , in the hands of someone like cameron , will not teach the value of the * struggle * for rights , but instead glorify the status quo . 
  indeed - but perhaps if you 'd been an irish boy at an english public school , you 'd draw a different conclusion . 
  well , more trying to draw them into the circle jerk . 
  the author 's point is that this particular circle jerk is a pro-establishment and very tory vision of english history - and one which traditionally leaves out awkward people like the irish , scots and welsh , as well as the tolpuddle martyrs and their ilk . 
  no , i suspect the author 's concern is exactly what i 've outlined . 
  magna carta was a key point in the history i was taught a generation ago in a highly tory pro-imperialist public school - the sort of place that still had a six-day week , boarding , cadet corps on monday afternoons , and sent the sons of the upper middle classes into the army , the church , and the city of london . 
  it was taught in exactly the kind of fetishised way i think cameron intends ( he 's a product of very similar schooling , after all ) , as something to be proud of but which was fundamentally not a symbol of struggle needed , but of how everything was already for the best in this best of all possible englands . 
  i rather think the author knows this too , because i suspect he 's another product of the same educational system . 
  if you do n't think that 's what he wants from it , i 'm simply going to beg to differ , because i really do know exactly what cameron 's thinking of here . 
  there is n't any way that the eu can become a federal europe unless that 's wanted by a very solid majority of eu citizens ( and politicians ) . 
  at the moment , it 's the preference only of a very small minority , so it 's effectively irrelevant to the eu as it stands . 
  the current eu is a joint action framework for the member state governments , not an entity separate from them . 
  it is * never * superior to the member states as a group - the powers it has above * individual * member states are those of a referee where the member states have agreed on pooled decision-making . 
  as such , there 's no reason to oppose the eu on the basis of something that might never happen , and which , if it does ever happen , will happen only because it 's desirable or acceptable to the majority of europe 's people . 
  it would be more sensible , surely , to support the eu as it is ( in principle , given its many imperfections ) , and to oppose federalism as a tendency within that ? 
  not that there 's much to oppose , really - mostly belgians . 
  it 's always wrong to fetishise a document , whether that document is the us constitution , magna carta , or the bible . 
  what matters , and has always matters , is the struggle of people to resist arbitrary power . 
  no document , no `` bill of rights '' means anything unless it is kept alive and backed by a constant willingness on the part of the people to resist arbitrary power - the document itself means nothing on its own , and its erection into some kind of enduring symbol of freedom carries with it the dangerous implication that you are already free , do n't need to struggle , and can go back to sleep . 
  that 's particularly likely to be what 's made of it in the hands of a tory government . 
  i 'll say this again , because the implications appear to go unheard : there is * no * country which did not save its larger banks if it could . 
  people are welcome to make up their own special specific reason why their specific country saved their banks - bullying from outside , euro membership , cowardly leadership , corruption - but it 's redundant . 
  no country that could save its larger banks so failed to do so . 
  people need to get used to this fact , because the special explanations imply that in the next crisis countries might * not * save their banks , because the special explanation you used this time might not apply . 
  but the special explanation is not true - your country * will * save its banks . 
  you can then invent another , new , special explanation for this entirely predictable outcome . 
  it will be equally wrong . 
  are you saying bond rates for state bonds in the us are uniform across the country ? 
  because last time i looked , illinois had an a - rating , florida had an aaa rating , and i presume their borrowing costs reflect those differences . 
   when the country bailed the banks ( which was mandatory , as it was an order of the eu ) the eu has never had the power to issue such an `` order '' , and i ca n't imagine it will ever be given it either . 
  on the contrary , the decision to bail the banks was a joint decision by the member states of the eu , with the eu instructed to assist with that . 
  when someone says something is an `` eu decision '' , you should always be careful to check whether it was a decision by the institutional eu ( commission , parliament , court of justice ) or a decision by the member states ( european council , council of ministers ) . 
  the declaration about banks on the 12th october 2008 was a council declaration , meaning a group decision by the member states ' governments , not something `` ordered by the eu '' . 
  that should hardly be surprising , given that after lehmans * every * other country , eu or not , bailed out their larger banks if they could . 
   he also condemned as `` unacceptable ... the orchestrated campaign of defamation '' against juncker after reports of harassment by british tabloids of members of his family in luxembourg who had called the police to complain . 
  seriously ? 
  the amount covers the salary of the mep and everything else as well . 
  irish meps usually provide a full breakdown , like this one by nessa childers : http://nessachilders.ie/my-work/transparency/ 2013 salary : pre-tax : $ 95,482.44 after tax ( irish tax * and * eu tax ) : $ 56,602.80 2013 travel ireland-brussels/strasbourg : $ 30,671.57 fully vouched ( approx 50 return trips/year ) 2013 travel in ireland : $ 9,577.77 vouched 2013 subsistence : $ 41,041.00 for 135 days 2013 staff costs : $ 260,771.08 for 6 people ( paid and reviewed directly by the parliament ) 2013 office expenses : $ 57,403.00 2013 health insurance : $ 1370.80 2013 conference and event costs : $ 33,733.00 fully vouched and paid directly to service providers looking at an mep 's costs it 's probably more reasonable to think of them as a small consultancy business . 
  the ceo of the business has to spend over a third of the year in attendance at brussels/strasbourg , plus attending events and conferences both as part of communication with the public and to boost expertise . 
  the business of the consultancy is to help steer legislation on behalf of the people of a region and communicate that legislation back to them . 
  the expertise provided by staff is extremely important . 
  meps vote on a very large range of legislative issues , and if they do n't have their own researchers , there are plenty of lobbyists willing to supply them with information on a topic ... 
  85k per year !, 
  now you just need to successfully get tens of thousands of people to vote you into the job ... although your salary will only really be $ 85k , and you 'll face a potential career-ending performance review in 5 years time . 
  poor analysis . 
  this is n't a fight between germany and the uk , because juncker is n't germany 's `` choice '' , and it is n't a battle about cameron 's vague plans for `` eu reform '' . 
  juncker is the parliament 's choice , which merkel is endorsing somewhat reluctantly , while cameron opposes the very idea of the parliament being able to choose . 
   i would say that having a strong eurosceptic member of the union is one of the key planks in preventing `` federal abomination '' . 
  if the uk leaves , who is going to form the opposition to such a venture ? 
  everyone else , of course . 
  it 's a peculiarly eurosceptic thing to believe that everyone but them is just gagging for a federal use . 
  only a rather small number of people want a use .
