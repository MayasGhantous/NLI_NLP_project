  maybe i 'm mistaken ? 
  i 'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to economics . 
  why is germany so in favour of austerity when even in countries where the majority in favour of it there is a sizable opposition ? 
  itt : people from outside greece commenting on the political situation there they 've only taken notice of in the last few months, 
  idiot, 
  no , he 's saying he 's glad they did, 
  well i work until 4am every weekday so do n't get too envious, 
  i realised i could n't tell the difference because it was early in the morning and i was whispering the words so as not to wake my family, 
  i do hear it now , i think i was just brain dead , i posted that comment at 7am , well before i normally work up, 
  are n't those the same ? 
  do i say my th weird ? 
  well , i do n't know , the population distribution of [ iceland ] ( http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/downloads/maps/gpw-v3/gpw-v3-population-density/isldens.jpg ) is very different to [ ireland ] ( http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/downloads/maps/gpw-v3/gpw-v3-population-density/irldens.jpg ) . 
  if the americans have a problem they can change their tax laws . 
  actually not though , when the facts are considered and not just this newfound notion that some other countries governments decided , and then told everybody .

  i think it 's more of a `` well ideally no , but why put another roadblock in the way of independence by being against the monarchy too '' surely , no ? 
  but now the facts are wrong, 
  if they had won would they have been allowed to go again next year ? 
  in a referendum , yeah kind of, 
  just curious , what about irish seems cool to you ? 
  i 'd love to know !, 
  have you come across it before ? 
  no to eu but yes to all of the eu 's laws without getting a say in creating them . 
  was it ever blood or was n't it more about culture, 
  okay so, 
  pretty sure it 's from this morning dude, 
  i know well , i 'm actually very proud of our defence forces record n, 
  it 's still funny though, 
  yes so why did you keep it is less than half old people want it is what i mean ? 
  i like 1 , 10 and 15 in that order !, 
  but 57 % of people voted against the current tri-colour ? 
  ron\u00e1n mullen is such an arse, 
  plenty of rats and snakes in my town, 
  theres no such thing as a state under communism, 
  how do you propose to take the means of production into private ownership without using totalitarian methods ? 
  would you say that north korea is democratic ? 
  because they 're called the democratic people 's republic and they are none of those things , or is that `` no-true-scotsman '' too ? 
  i have an orange in my pocket , it 's long and yellow but `` no-true-scotsman '' means it 's still an orange . 
  communism is explicitly not totalitarian . 
  just because the democratic people 's republic of korea says it 's `` democratic '' does n't mean it is . 
  just because a cult leader says he 's a profit does n't mean that he is . 
  the problem is you 're looking at it on a very micro scale , and at a macro scale where benefits to every man would result from a systemic change . 
  i 've seen your comments up and down this thread , you have no idea what communism is other than that you 're extremely against it, 
  communism is about decentralising power . 
  if you bothered to do any research whatsoever into what you 're talking about you 'd know that the phrase `` dictatorship of the proletariat '' simply means that the destiny of the people is in the hands of the working class , the opposite of `` the dictatorship of capital '' - it does not mean a totalitarian dictatorship . 
  centralised power states like the ussr were not communist states . 
  this thread is full of idiots and former soviet countries equating totalitarianism with communism which is absolutely idiotic . 
  reactionaries get out !, 
  explain ? 
  because the very definition of communism is to give every human equal opportunities . 
  you 're up and down this thead denouncing communism and yet you have no idea what it actually is . 
  because the system we live in demands that they do, 
  showing you have no knowledge on the subject, 
  except the eurocrats were elected , the people just do n't give a damn about the elections when they happen . 
   ... the oecd 's ** director of its centre for tax policy and administration ** pascal saint-amans said definitively that ireland ** did not fill any of the relevant criteria ** for the oecd to class this state as a tax haven . 
   `` the definition for a tax haven that was ** internationally agreed ** classes it as a country with a zero tax rate , no transparency or exchange of information , and no real operations on the ground there , '' i ca n't tell if you 're thick or just stubborn . 
  a left wing irish website ? 
  the oecd is not ` one guys ' opinion . 
  it 's the opinion of one of the worlds largest organisations that specifically deals with tax avoidance . 
  and the independent is a hugely right-wing publication , with the largest newspaper circulation in ireland . 
  in fact it 's your opinion that 's just `` some guys opinion '' . 
  yes , it 's so vague and does n't have set criteria other than `` low '' . 
  the oecd gives a better and fuller definition http://m.independent.ie/business/irish/ireland-not-a-tax-haven-says-oecd-29443601.html, 
   it depends on your definition what definition are you using ? 
  your own made up one ? 
  according to the oecd ireland des not fit the definition of tax haven by any means . 
   with the obvious aim to draw multinationals into setting up `` headquarters '' not sure why you have headquarters in inverted commas since generally they are actual headquarters.having a highly educated , english speaking workforce within both the eu and the eurozone is a much higher draw for multinationals than a transparent tax regime , though that does also contribute . 
   12.5 % is shockingly low . 
  ireland 's rate is low but is transparent . 
  the effective tax rates when compared across the eu put ireland towards the higher end . 
  ireland is not a tax haven for christ 's sake , how this meme ever gained any traction is beyond me . 
  i know of an american girl who was studying in amsterdam and her parents made her come home early because of the paris attacks ... 
  b-b-but i got # 5 extra in my wage slip after a budget so they 're brilliant !, 
  i wonder what czechs think of ireland because since i first visited czechia it has been my favourite country outside my own . 
  i 'm not sure i trust your claim that there 's 5 billion statistics being pushed out every week . 
  i just make the food the night before and bring it to work where they 'll have microwaves and grills to reheat it, 
  no it is n't, 
  and use the euro, 
  how ? 
  kwee-shak ( but the k has more of a throatiness to it ) is how i 'd pronounce that . 
  interviewer is / u/stabinthedart original post is [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dublin/comments/4azbqi/i_went_into_town_yesterday_to_show_people_why_i/ ), 
  i just do n't get it at all , i have free texts and already use messenger . 
  all my friends have facebook so maybe it 's different to your situation i just do n't get why in my situation those people are using what 's app and not messenger . 
  i just do n't understand why in a world where basically everybody has a facebook account people use a different facebook app that less people use to do exactly what facebook messenger has been doing for years . 
  it just boggles my mind , what is the point ? 
   the city is used by the eu as an example to eastern europeans of how not to grow a city . 
  interesting , do you have a link where i an read more ? 
  we decided not to elect a government just in time for the centenary of 1916, 
  sounds about right !, 
  just so you know renua is similar to the irish ` r\u00e9 nua ' which means ` new era ' but also sounds like `` renew '' in english . 
  horrible party but excellent name . 
  he 's not saying he does n't like the dublin accent , he 's saying the narrator did a bad job at the dublin accent . 
  korfball too !, 
  well he 's not the pm anymore , he 's the leader of an election campaign so really he should be straight with what his plans are . 
  he thinks that by being vague he can act as though he knows more than the other parties . 
  you 're kind of picking what ever a you 're mentioning very selectively though is my point . 
  these terrible thing happen in every war and ca n't be excused , but on the whole civilian casualties make up a small proportion of the people murdered by the republican side during the troubles , less than the british army and hugely less than the loyalist paramilitaries . 
  i 'm not defending them , i 'm just saying that things are n't always as black and white as `` terrorism '' or `` legitimate military tactic '' especially when the legitimate military is secretly conspiring with paramilitaries on one side and engaging in mass killings of unarmed civilians . 
  actually it tuned out that the army council still existed but was no longer involved in paramilitary activity . 
  there was never a danger of returning to the troubles the government on the `` brink of collapse '' was simply a distraction tactic because of the dup leader 's dodgy dealing with nama coming to light .
