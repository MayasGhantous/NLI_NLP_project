  can retain their own language and have an excellent fluency of english i do n't see why that would be any different for ireland . 
  personally , i think there should be no problem for primary schooling to be entirely through irish . 
  i went to an all-irish school and it did n't hinder my english at all , rather it made it easier to learn french later in life and has given me a huge appreciation for the uniqueness of the language . 
  there are words in ireland that just do n't exist in english and there is a difference in the way the language is used that can help to express oneself with a different perspective . 
  this actually already happens in ireland , some people saying that children should be taught chinese instead of irish . 
  typical french answer to regional languages, 
  warning : this is what americans actually believe, 
  he said 53 % of his income is gone in taxes , i 'm not sure what you 're arguing since even going on your figures that 's wrong . 
  employer prsi is not a tax on the employees income , as if you are prsi-exempt paying your income does not get increased . 
  it is a tax on the employer based on the employee 's remuneration . 
   your average will be considerably less than this . 
  exactly my point . 
  edit : i just realised i 'm not replying to the same person , apologies / r/ewannnn, 
  40 % on everything * over * 33,8000 . 
  10.75 % you saw is paid by the employer not the employee . 
  so no , this commenter is mistaken as far as i 'm concerned . 
  he 's not being charged tax of 53 % is what i 'm saying, 
  i work in payroll in ireland and honestly ca n't fathom a situation where his tax could be this high even taking that into account, 
  it 's nonsense , it 's either a lie or a gross misunderstanding of how taxation works, 
  i 'll bring some grappling hooks to the giant 's causeway this weekend , you stand on the other side and make sure they attach properly and then i 'll reel you in . 
  you might need tog o down to your border with england during the week and saw scotland off so it 's easier for me to reel you in . 
  thanks, 
  you 're some gowl, 
  growth for the sake of growth is the definition of cancer, 
  `` defence '', 
  plus if you do try to leave then you have to deal with b\u00f3thar na dtreabh and the headford road punishing you with traffic, 
  hiberno-english . 
  i have never ever ever in my life as an irish person heard someone say `` irish '' and mean english . 
  uhhhh no it does n't, 
  yeah just like how we translate documents into germanic for the english, 
  purge the blairites chairman corbyn !!, 
  it 's not about now it 's about doing research , publishing a whitepaper on what the reunification process would look like and then making an informed decision . 
  saying there 's no appetite and so we should do nothing helps to do nothing other than maintain the status quo . 
  kerrygold is fine , it 's just that all irish butter ( dairygold , connaght gold ) is the same quality as kerrygold , even the aldi version ( kilkeely gold ) . 
  of course we are not counting those `` spreads '' that are n't real butter in this example . 
  what polls are you talking about ? 
  any i 've seen show the [ overwhelming opposite ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/prime-time-irelands-call-2426738-nov2015/ ), 
  it absolutely would pass , there is almost no situation under which it would n't pass, 
  why is that necessary ? 
  tenner says you 're from the pale, 
  post in / r/ireland to get pint buddies, 
  aw okay , 
  everybody waits the same . 
  nobody gets to cut in line because they 're rich, 
  `` let the poor die so the rich can be free '', 
  ooooh that 's good !, 
  two manhattans and you light them on fire ? 
  yes but sweden has pop music superpowers the rest of the world does n't, 
  re.stores are so cheap , dodgy-looking , barren and shite compared to when thy were just topaz stores , i never go into mine anymore . 
  i 'm a different person, 
  it 's easy for them to vote against something when they 're not in government . 
  i just think that if they ended up in a coalition again they 'd happily fold and vote with a bill like snooper 's charter without so much as a second thought, 
  i just do n't think it 's as much of a red-line issue for them as you think it is, 
   people do n't want the rest of the country to become berlin for people outside germany can you explain what this means , for context ? 
  what policies are implemented in berlin by the government there ? 
  they flipped on the issue of student loans which was much more of a big issue for them than encryption ... 
  no way man , only thing lidl has going for it is the bakery , everything else is wake compared to aldi, 
  i know this is bait but it still made my blood boil, 
  majority of scottish trade to ruk subsequently goes on to the eu actually . 
  `` if it meant the government paying $ 9bn a year '' is a fairly loaded question and the question also does n't give a timescale . 
  go out on the streets and ask if people would be in favour of eventual reunification within our lifetimes and see how high the response is . 
  last i had seen this question asked it was ~ ~ over two thirds in favour . ~ ~ [ 82.5 % in favour not including `` do n't knows '' . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_ireland#in_the_republic_of_ireland ), 
  no it makes as much sense as calling europe `` the french continent '' and then claiming it 's a geographical term when everybody points out how ridiculous and politically loaded that term is . 
  why the fuck do you even need a term for both islands ? 
  whats the geographical term for ireland and iceland ? 
  the irish isles ? 
  do you see how bloody idiotic this `` geographical term '' bollocks is ? 
  thanks for your perspective , it was very interesting to read . 
  i like most of macron 's big , european-wide ideas but i have to say his domestic policy is not too my taste and some of it creeps me out . 
  * sighs *, 
  is there really no hope for a m\u00e9lenchon / hamon team up ? 
  together they could have as much as macron or le pen . 
  imagine if it ended up being m/h vs macron for the presidency !, 
  the problem is that for many in the uk their only knowledge on interaction with northern ireland is when the provos placed bombs in england . 
  they do n't have much knowledge of the preceding apartheid state in northern ireland and the crushing of the civil rights movement that lead to the development of the ira . 
  it 's telling that you often see comments saying things like `` they should have pursue peaceful means '' or that peaceful protest should have been their modus operandi . 
  what this fails to realise is that peaceful protest asking for integrated schools , the right to vote and get jobs , and an end to gerrymandering were shot down by the british army and opposed by loyalist groups . 
  if peaceful protest in not working and the police are disinterested in protecting one section of their population then surely violence is inevitable ? 
  it 's not palatable , or nice , or good of course but it was inevitable . 
  it 's therefore disheartening and stupid for people to turn around and say they should have pursued protest or politics when this was their original aim . 
  in the end mcguiness was willing to sit down and negotiate peace , and it was his side that had to work to convince the unionist side to sit down and negotiate peace , as they were the side opposed to the good friday agreement because it helped to end unionist dominance of all facets of normal life in northern ireland . 
  please let me be clear i am not glorifying the actions of the ira and i do understand why some of those within great britain would feel the way they do , i just feel that there is the absence of recognition by a lot of them ( not all ) of how british policy in northern ireland lead to an inevitable violent fight back . 
  and peacemaker, 
  yeah maybe if you 've never read anything about him . 
  father of elected monarchy and tyranny maybe . 
  eh no not really, 
  i like how your tldr is many times longer than your actual comment :d, 
  i think this commenter is thinking of with when he was chosen as one of the [ ten greatest britons . 
  ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2341661.stm ), 
  not reeeally what i said , i just think it was a silly choice of event by the daily mail . 
  also `` arrested the wrong people '' is very different to `` deliberately perverting the course of justice '' . 
  here 's an [ exhaustive list ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vstdov0c1do&amp;t=200 ), 
  well yeah , except the right hand picture is of a bombing where 4 people were [ framed by the police ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guildford_four_and_maguire_seven ), 
  halloween is also irish !, 
  yeah i 'm sure south america would love to be in a union with a country that conducts a coup any time a leader is elected that they do n't like . 
  i 'm real proud of it because i thought of it on the morning that brexit ref was lost and posted it on r/scotland and people seemed to like it . 
  it 's would be so funny if it actually took off . 
  thanks bby, 
  thanks friend !,
