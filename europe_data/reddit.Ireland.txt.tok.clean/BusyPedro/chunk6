  i 'll leave it up for people to laugh at me, 
  that 's your opinion but it 's definitely not an extreme idea . 
  an extreme idea is guillotining the bourgeoisie . 
  nationalised public transport exists in many countries , such as ireland - which is governed by the conservative party at present . 
  jesus is this the point we 've gotten to where that 's considered extremism ? 
  he 's a moderate social democrat . 
  nothing he 's proposing is extremely radical , just different to the current preoccupation with neoliberalism in much of the west . 
  do it ya cowards !, 
  in ireland they 've started just saying ` pride ' instead of all the letters which is a good idea i think, 
  maybe some people are just communists ... not everyone who disagrees with you is brainwashed !, 
  but why not at least ask the question . 
  it could give us some context to what a hamon/melanchon alliance might look like, 
  why is there never a question asking hamon/le pen melanchon/le pen or macron/fillon ? 
  it 's nowhere near the difference of east germany but there is a lot of artificial state intervention and an extremely large public sector to maintain it 's viability, 
  okay , now take one of those small countries and draw an arbitrary line around one of it 's biggest cities and see what happens . 
  look at my comment reply to another user for more context on why i have this opinion . 
  currency , legal system , tax difference , transport links , political system and many companies only operate on one side of the border or the other, 
  well my core reasoning for my statement is just to look at the fact that in the uk belfast is an isolated city cut off from the mainland and doubly cut off by a border on the island . 
  in a united ireland belfast would immediately be the country 's second city and many of the roadblocks to trade and isolation would be gone . 
  look at donegal which could serve as a great feeder on consumers into derry . 
  it already does to a certain extend but barrier remain . 
  look at this [ transport map ] ( http://www.discoveringireland.com/images/stories/ireland/train_routes.jpg ) for instance , the north not only cuts itself off but causes trouble for donegal and other parts of the border regions . 
  this [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/31ako0/why_would_a_united_ireland_make_sense_for_any/cpzx8f2/ ) goes into far greater detail about wy the conventional wisdom on ui is flawed at best and wrong at worst and i urge you to take a look . 
  finally we have this [ report ] ( http://prcg.com/modeling-irish-unification/report.pdf ) into modelling a united ireland though there have been questions raised about this report due to it 's funding . 
  username not relevant, 
  on the other hand , it kind of only runs such a deficit because of partition and would be more likely to eventually thrive after reunification, 
  irish people get on great with the poles !,

  hahaha exactly !, 
  glad you enjoyed it !, 
  you do you , friend !, 
  thanks !, 
  did n't realise till you said it, 
  lem me know how you get on . 
  i recommend drinking a lot of beer before eating them for proper authenticity . 
  sounds good, 
  man apart from [ garlic cheese ] ( https://supermacs.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/garlic-cheese-fries.png ) we have [ curry cheese ] ( https://supermacs.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/curry-cheese-chips.png ) chips or [ taco fries ] ( https://supermacs.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/taco-fries.png ) , are either of those the same thing ? 
  i thought you were trying to annoy me by calling me a britton, 
  try harder, 
  the one for ireland did n't even say pie . . 
  had a look at the page on [ uefas site ] ( http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=2304882.html ) . 
  it seems like the data is absolute bollocks since they asked one person in each country , and also not even displayed on the map properly according to the bollocks they came up with . 
  we do n't eat pies man, 
  i meant it was odd that we would be lumped in with the uk since the map has borders , not that all the different countries have national teams . 
  oh baby i 'd wreck a garlic cheese chips right now, 
  yeah i did find that odd, 
  usually burgers and hot dog . 
  i 'd say we 've been lumped n with the uk or something . 
   disposa ca n't tell if typing error or biting satire of how our government treats our diaspora, 
  why ? 
   that 's like wearing shoes two sizes too small on purpose so you can feel relieved when you take them off at night . 
  brilliant !, 
  haha, 
  haha, 
  yep, 
   turkey . 
   europe . 
  ireland will outlive you all, 
  i can accept that people might be pro-tpp but that 's pretty crap reasoning . 
  wat country are you ? 
  how dare you stereotype !, 
  i 'm extremely hungover , not drunk !, 
  not cool but funny, 
  i think it 's circulation was just over 20,000 last time i checked but i 'm not sure where to find the current circulation figures of irish magazines . 
  i 'm not sure if this figure will seem low to people from other countries but the village is quite well respected and is generally read by academics , government officials , business people and those in the voluntary sector . 
  haha come to ireland and find out for yourself !, 
  but i see from your account that you are a brand new account pushing an agenda so the facts probably do n't matter, 
  it 's a bit mad but i think irish have a culture of being willing to say anything for a joke and not taking things too seriously . 
  please explan, 
  imo it 's better to use gnp , since aic assumes increased consumption = increased welfare which does not account for cultural difference with regard to the importance of consumption . 
  what do the red lines appearing on some countries mean ? 
  we could make the united states of europe and russia and then call all of our laws user agreements . 
  is it every calendar year or every 12 month rolling period ? 
  perhaps , but that 's a separate issue that would need a solution . 
  it 's not really an excuse not to try something in my opinion . 
  difficult to get the idea going but it 's not any more impossible than financial auditors , nuclear power auditor or other sensitive industries . 
  really ? 
  i was n't aware of that . 
  it would take a while to build up the capability but i do think it is realistic . 
  think about the complexity of a financial audit on a company like gm , where there 's a will there 's a way . 
   let the free market sort it out . 
  because that always works out great . 
  why have a government at all sure ? 
  you 're assuming zero transaction costs . 
  what 65-year-old has a full understanding of the capabilities of new tech companies ? 
  what 13-year-old has an awareness of the legal and social consequences of clicking i agree ? 
  what everyday working person with no interest in tech has the time or the interest to learn everything about privacy laws and the capabilities of deep learning technology . 
  we elect governments to enforce rights and to create rights to protect us . 
  you can disagree with specific governments but to say that because someone does n't understand something that they therefore do n't give a shit about privacy is a gross misrepresentation of the truth . 
  to say that the free market will fix it is a gross misrepresentation of history , intelligence , economics and human behavior . 
  what we need as a society is to come up with data protection auditors in the same way as we have financial auditors . 
  experienced developers that can go in to these companies and audit their source code to ensure compliance with data protection laws and uncover any potential malicious conduct . 
  this may seem difficult to do now but going forward it will be a necessity in my opinion . 
   registered voters not population . 
  consider that universal suffrage was only extended to all 4 years prior to this vote and that people with a nationalist background were disproportionately affected by the absence of the right to vote prior to this . 
  well i tend to agree with you in one sense but you 're also glossing over the fact that the vote was boycotted by nationalists , and the fact that the border was originally drawn to ensure a loyalist majority - so things are not always that cut and dry . 
  `` t\u00edr gan teanga , t\u00edr gan anam '' is a popular phrase in ireland that means a country without a language is a country without a soul . 
  hate to be that arsehole who does around correcting people 's irish , but it 's scamaill , not scamallach . 
  what you wrote means `` one may live without one 's friendly , but not without one 's pipe '', 
  that 's why i said he 's as right as you can get without becoming fn,
