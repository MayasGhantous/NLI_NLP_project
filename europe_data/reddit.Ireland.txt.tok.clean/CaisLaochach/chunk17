  bearable , but not great . 
  ireland does n't have conventional factory jobs though . 
  we were never an industrial economy , we went from agricultural to services . 
  most industrial output in ireland is either focused on agriculture or high-end products , e.g. , medical equipment , pharma , etc. 
  how many thousands of government workers were sacked ? 
  how much did taxes go up by ? 
  and for how long ? 
  what services disappeared ? 
  what was social welfare cut to ? 
  if you consider most of those questions , unpleasant as people might find the idea , very few of those measures were in any way harsh . 
  usc was hated , but for most people it was an extra 5 % tax , taxes that had been cut under ff anyway . 
  the big `` losers '' to usc were ( and remain ) the wealthy , who end up paying north of 50 % in taxes on a large chunk of their income . 
  services were reduced across the country but few if any disappeared . 
  indeed , we saw no real attempt at rationalisation . 
  early in the crisis a lot of economists and commentators thought there might be scope to tackle certain bloated public sectors , such as healthcare . 
  however , that was n't done either for fear of the political consequences . 
  social welfare rates were reduced for under 25s significantly but the core social welfare payment was saved for most people . 
  and of course pensions were raided , it was that or start sacking people and/or raising taxes . 
  if you think austerity was harsh then you clearly do n't know much about ireland 's economic history . 
  ireland is 2010 to 2012 was a lot wealthier than any time in the 1980s . 
  irish people do n't look at our gdp , we look at our gnp . 
  have done for years . 
  the greek governments of recent decades have to be culpable . 
  as do our own , and those in italy , spain , portugal . 
  greece was not run sustainably for a long period of time and that leads to the current situation . 
  unfortunately for the greeks , there is little appetite to fix things , so the eu wo n't help them more than it has to . 
  nah , as a concept that 's overstated . 
  if you look at corporate tax rates across europe , the major countries have very high ones . 
  if you look at average corporate tax rates paid , it 's always significantly below that . 
  [ http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/france-has-lower-effective-tax-rate-than-ireland-study-227320.html] ( http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/france-has-lower-effective-tax-rate-than-ireland-study-227320.html ), 
  ireland was able to escape with minimal austerity , but it caused a lot of political unrest and abject misery for a significant minority of people . 
  greece is a basket-case compared to ireland and needs substantive reforms that would likely be brutal . 
  ah dublin 's ireland in a microcosm . 
  it contains some of the poorest areas in ireland and almost all of the richest ones . 
  i meant in terms of agricultural rather than size !, 
  ireland was a basketcase until the 90s . 
  norway and ireland would have had similar historical economies . 
  we did n't find oil though . 
  our gdp is `` artificially '' boosted , as the irish government has made quite clear . 
  as to the latter , irish governments use indirect tax to tax the angry poor . 
  as to the former , ireland was a largely agricultural economy that transitioned to a service economy without much in between . 
  it means that you have an economy built upon high-end manufacturing ( we produce an awful lot of europe 's pharmaceuticals for example ) and the provision of services . 
  as such , there are large parts of the country that would never have really developed into anything other than a post-agricultural economy . 
  meanwhile , in the major cities , i.e. , dublin and cork , and their hinterlands there are large amounts of very well remunerated-jobs and the inevitable trickle-down effect leads to comparatively decent incomes across the board . 
  easiest place to find it is here : - [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taxation_in_the_republic_of_ireland#rates_of_income_tax] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taxation_in_the_republic_of_ireland#rates_of_income_tax ) the tax rate up to 33k for a normal person is 20 % . 
  given that the median income is about $ 20k , that 's $ 4k in tax per annum . 
  however , there are quite generous tax credits that wipe out 1650 of that . 
  thus , you 're only paying about $ 2.5 k in tax before deductions . 
  most people will incur enough expenses to eat into that $ 2.5 k sufficiently to be paying effectively no income tax . 
  only half our working population pays income tax . 
  we 're not very good at raising taxes . 
  would n't there just be the same level of regulatory capture ? 
  for now , sure . 
  there 's going to be a concerted effort to introduce consolidated cross-border tax rates . 
  we were weaker then , and the double irish was causing more harm than good . 
  everybody knows it 's a fighting retreat with our tax rates . 
  not sure we 'd be so bolshie if you were right . 
  [ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5j5idw/ireland_to_fight_eu_order_to_collect_13bn_in_back/dbdks6d/] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5j5idw/ireland_to_fight_eu_order_to_collect_13bn_in_back/dbdks6d/ ) ireland is almost never this aggressive in defending our interests , we 've always relied on a conciliatory approach . 
  well again , ireland 's case is that apple 's treatment was not special but available to any company involved in international trade from here . 
  tbh , i suspect we 're going to win the appeal . 
  the commission appears to be trying to create political pressure on our government because it knows it 's in the wrong . 
  well , no , it 's not about that , it 's about the commission alleging apple got a special deal and the revenue commissioners saying that was n't true . 
  it was n't enforced but attitudes to homosexuals could be appalling . 
  there were also some isolated instances of violence that attracted despicably little in the way of punishment . 
  cork is slightly more economically productive than dublin . 
  limerick has always been shite . 
  germany does n't seem to hate jews anymore . 
  why wo n't austria women vote for kinder , kuche and kirche ? 
  i just ca n't quite figure it out ... 
  if we 're being official there 's no such place as the republic of ireland . 
  derry 's got a much scarier accent . 
  clinton 's centre-left by american standards . 
  ireland 's big problem is that most young people came of age during either a massive financial bubble or in the aftermath of its collapse . 
  a great many lefties here are demanding spending levels akin to the boom days , and winning a lot of support amongst the poor and young . 
  it 's leading to a scenario where the centre-left has largely died because they 've largely accepted this is unsustainable , meaning that the centre ground is being completely ceded to the right . 
  was n't there some issue with sindelar retiring rather than play as well ? 
  my memory is n't great on the subject . 
  partially because the highlands were cleared , as was the west of ireland . 
  those floods a few years ago in the riviera were insane . 
  plus quite a few of the towns and cities are built on steep enough slopes . 
  those do look class , in fairness . 
  appearing in front of multiple judges is a nightmare . 
  traditionally it was to scare the ever-living piss out of potential litigants and to engender a healthy sense of awe in the minds of ordinary people . 
  these buildings were designed to frighten , to impress and to always remind people of the power of the law , of justice and of the state . 
  the issue in ireland is that there 's always been a lot of money from america sloshing around the pro-life movement and they 're very unhappy at the idea that somebody might do the same for the other side . 
  spend some time in the chancery and jr lists and you 'll get a feel for them . 
  they 're rural people , usually farmers concerned about land value . 
  the people objecting to wind turbines are in no way `` gucci-wearing middle-class guardian readers . '', 
  the vast majority of the objections have come from farmers and rural ireland . 
  this false narrative again ? 
  the deal is `` shit '' because it costs too much to extract oil in irish waters . 
  there are two ways to find oil , spend * billions * yourself , or let the private market do it in exchange for generous tax , etc. 
  guess which 80s ireland went for . 
  also , the law can be changed pretty easily . 
  and if it were procured by corruption , even more easily again . 
  and people said there 'd be no benefits to brexit . 
   you can not have bad debtors without bad creditors . 
  where did you come up with that nonsense ? 
  how are italy and spain not major economies in their own right ? 
  italy is certainly almost as large as the trio you 've mentioned .
