definitely getting a * lucha libre * vibe from these . 
  i suspect the edl is composed of fantasists who spent their childhoods watching wwf/wwe believing it was real , the same level of disconnection from reality it takes to actually believe that the uk is being taken over by immigrants . 
  i think that comic was reposted quite a lot during the competition . 
  [ yes , as evidenced a few weeks ago ... ] ( http://cache2.asset-cache.net/gc/450710808-germany-fans-celebrate-during-a-public-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=iwsasset&amp;k=2&amp;d=gkzz8bf5zl1ziijumxa7qxnu5lmosd1%2fkaqpicczagcyy83c9tytuuld0pq9%2f8cz ), 
  couple of possible alternatives - [ carrickfergus castle ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/carrickfergus_castle,_reflections_at_sunset_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1098306.jpg ) and the [ bushmills whiskey distillery ] ( http://accessibleireland.ilikecake.ie/advertisement_thumbnail/251image.jpg ) - the world 's oldest licensed whiskey distillery . 
  also , politics aside , i 've always thought [ stormont ] ( http://www.tom-molloy.com/images/landscapes/stormont.jpg ) is one of the most impressive and imposing parliamentary buildings i 've ever seen . 
  edit : i 'd be tempted to make the antrim coast road from larne to portrush a wonder as it includes many of the ones already listed and is a beautiful scenic drive . 
  that 's what i thought - from what i read i got the impression that arriva were updating a large portion of the fleet and phasing out the old vehicles . 
  i suppose the new ones are more pleasant to travel in ( i 've taken the old buses during summer when the temperature was around 40 \u00b0 c and ac would have been very welcome ) and more efficient and environmentally friendly , but it 's still sad to see a tradition die out . 
  are they still running the old yellow buses in malta ? 
  i remember reading somewhere not long ago that they were to be phased out and the whole business sold to a major operator - possibly stagecoach !, 
  edit : seems it was arriva - and they [ appear to have pulled out . 
  ] ( http://coachandbusweek.com/2014/01/arriva-leaves-malta/ ), 
  yeah , it was the legal obligation part he failed to comply with , which is why he was dismissed . 
  i wonder if / r/shitthedailymailsays is a thing yet . 
  hmm , apparently it is , but there are n't any posts there . 
  strange , i 'd have thought it should be full . 
  i first remember the term `` boat people '' being used in the late 1970s by national media in the uk to describe refugees attempting to escape from vietnam by boat after the war . 
  i guess it 's just a term that has stuck around . 
  i think it was meant as a [ tasteless joke . 
  you can buy it in norway too , i saw it for sale in safari and many other shops in bergen . 
  [ `` irelande douze pointe '' ] ( http://youtu.be/ps3kxgo_gro ) fucking masterpiece . 
  i think it 's the norm in mexico - at least it seemed to be in mexico city and cancun . 
  might be different in other parts of the country . 
  perhaps the uk could lean a little heavier on some of its dependencies and overseas territories that facilitate similar arrangements , such as jersey , isle of man , gibraltar , british virgin islands , bermuda etc. 
  no mention of whiskey or would that be included under vodka ? 
  presumably aquavit would fall into the same category as well ? 
  because something did n't go the usa 's way . 
  it must be an attack on their freedoms . 
  i 'm really not sure which aspect of this story i find most wtf , that the swedes have a children 's tv programme with musical arses and talking turds , or that russia is trying to use it to dissuade ukraine from closer ties with the eu . 
  the photo does it for me , i can only imagine the character on the left sitting there thinking , `` three years at drama college well spent . '', 
  you might appreciate [ this video . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p_0s1typju ), 
  non-profit means that it 's not set up to make profits for shareholders . 
  it wo n't run at a loss , but the money raised will go back into the industry and infrastructure . 
  the experience of privatising the utility industries in the uk has been that shareholders have benefited greatly at the cost of reduced investment in infrastructure . 
  if investment interferes with the business of returning dividends for shareholders you can pretty much guarantee which one will lose out . 
  good point , i 'd be all for that too . 
  is there any good reason for ukraine not having free trade agreements with both the russian-led group and the eu ? 
  does it have to be either/or ? 
  that 's an england flag . 
  the northern irish version has a shield with a red hand in the centre . 
  as a native english speaker i find polish incomprehensible . 
  looking at any word of more than about five letters - basically not either * z\u0142oty * or * \u017curek * - leaves me wondering how the hell it 's pronounced . 
  i 'm not completely sure about the other two either . 
  it 's not far off what the last pope said , that the child abuse scandals which dogged the catholic church were down to an increasingly secular society , rather than an environment within the church that turned a blind eye and covered them up . 
  i suppose in a way he was right . 
  if society had n't become more secular there would n't have been any accusations . 
  there would have been just as much clerical abuse , just no allegations . 
  i wonder if the new guy is going to do anything about clearing that mess up , or if he 's more likely to carry on hugging the poor and unfortunate , and distracting from the real issues . 
  `` flogging a dead horse '' is slightly different , that 's more pursuing an issue that has already been resolved rather bringing up an old contentious issue . 
  the english equivalent is [ `` straining the greens . 
  '' ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=straining%20the%20greens ) i do n't think it 's commonly used any more . 
  i 've heard that one in regards to [ something other than the weather . 
  ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wetter%20than%20an%20otter%27s%20pocket ) another animal one that i 've used is , `` rough as a badger 's arse . '', 
  it 's a description of feeling ill , either from sickness or a hangover . 
  to go awol . 
  a bit old-fashioned , but a polite way of announcing that you 're going for a leak is to say , `` i 'm going to turn my bike around . '', 
  i do n't think it 's widely used any more . 
  similar one in english is `` let sleeping dogs lie , '' in other words not restart old arguments . 
  * raining cats and dogs * is an english idiom for heavy rain i 've always thought strange . 
  you 're logged in on the wrong account . 
  i would n't , i 'm in the process of emigrating to canada , so i 've had to explain the situation a few times . 
  this one 's either a moron or a troll . 
  i 'm going with troll for now - that 's not to say they 're not a moron as well . 
  it 's a distinct possibility that they have a foot in each camp . 
  i 'd have thought so . 
  i suppose it depends on how good your local bottle shop is and how extensive their imported beer range is . 
  you could probably contact the brewery and ask them if you were that interested . 
  that 's a pity as it used to have quite a distinctive taste before inbev took over . 
  i do n't like it at all , although i 'm talking about the canned stuff contract-brewed in the uk . 
  it has some nasty off-flavour to it that i do n't like - much like one of the polish beers , \u017bywiec i think . 
  i 've had a few decent italian beers from [ birra del borgo ] ( http://www.birradelborgo.it/en ) which is located slightly northeast of rome . 
  their beers are generally [ rather highly rated . 
  ] ( http://www.ratebeer.com/brewers/birra-del-borgo/6100/ ) they also collaborated with dogfish head and the [ milanese brewery baladin ] ( http://www.baladin.it/en/ ) to set up a [ microbrewery in new york ] ( http://www.eataly.com/birreria/ ) attached to an italian restaurant . 
  good call . 
  i visit bergen quite regularly and drink hansa in preference to ringnes . 
  that said , last time i was there i found a bar selling \u00c6gir and n\u00f8gne \u00d8 beers , so i drank them instead and was very pleasantly impressed . 
  tabloid headlines would be : * it 's brrritain !, 
  i think it 's an attempted joke about [ this story . 
  ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20130930-france-against-romania-bulgaria-schengen-roma-europe-immigration ), 
  i knew that everything portuguese became incredibly fashionable among the upper class following the marriage , but i did n't know the specifics - other than tea . 
  also , the alliance between portugal and england is the world 's oldest , with the [ earliest treaty dating to 1373 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-portuguese_treaty_of_1373 ), 
  i call myself irish because i was born in ireland to irish parents , have an irish passport and birth certificate and lived 19 years of my life there . 
  the portuguese started it , the english copied them when catherine of braganza married charles ii . 
  before that it was a coffee-drinking nation . 
  i 'm sure there are people who could arrange that . 
  thanks . 
  one of the things that saddens me most about northern ireland is the quality of politicians there . 
  there are issues that affect everyone - unemployment , education , the economy etc , etc , etc ; but for decades rather than address these very real issues the politicians would rather argue about flags and murals . 
  what really grinds my gears is that progress was initially made by the sdlp and ulster unionists towards sorting this shit out , but for some reason the more extreme parties - who stood against progress at the time - have become the main parties . 
  it runs completely counter to common-sense in my opinion . 
  if anything one of the main dividends of * peace * should have been a move away from sectarian politics towards the centre-ground . 
  quite why the reverse has happened is beyond my comprehension . 
  preferably one who does n't have a terrorist history and is n't a member of a fundamentalist sect . 
  the most popular one would be guinness , but the best - at least in my opinion - would probably be [ whitewater brewery 's belfast lager ] ( http://www.whitewaterbrewery.com/index.php/beers ) which actually tastes like a good german or czech lager ; and much better than the bland mass-produced crap normally available . 
  i 'd rather have zurek and/or golabki . 
  probably something that goes well with czech beer . 
  i 'm not exactly sure .
