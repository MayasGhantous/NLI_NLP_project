  there 's a whole range of criteria used to determine * happiness * in this study and i 'm sure we could debate the validity of the methodology from now until doomsday . 
  [ the introduction to the report \\ ( pdf format \\ ) ] ( http://unsdsn.org/files/2013/09/worldhappinessreport2013_online.pdf ) sets out the definition of * happiness * that they were trying to measure and section 2 contains the description of the method they used and the conclusions they 've drawn as well as the table . 
  taken out of context of the report the table 's pretty much a useless cherry-picked piece of data . 
  i must confess that i 've only skimmed over it and have n't read it in detail , but the explanation is probably in there somewhere . 
  ( i 'd probably be more likely to read it if i could get my hands on a print or ereader copy than trying to read it on my computer screen .

  another norwegian . 
  amusing since i 've been to norway more often and for longer than i have been to any other country ( other than ireland and the uk where i live . ), 
  wonder if i 've caught norwegian attitudes there . 
  do danes normally sing when they have n't been drinking , because i 'm fairly sure irish people do n't . 
  going off-topic here , but do norwegians sound drunk to you ? 
  only when i go to norway and try to speak the language i get told that i speak like a dane with a mouth full of pebbles . 
  it can be . 
  i have a close friend from norway and she pronounces * v * in english as * w * - despite having lived in england for 15 years . 
  no idea how she pronounces it in norwegian as i do n't speak the language and it all sounds like a form of singing to me . 
  i always thought a german `` v '' was pronounced more like an english `` f '' as in words like * volk * or * vielleicht . 
  maybe later , but spain is still likely to be a damn sight better than what they were leaving .

  german is a very easy language to learn . 
  the grammar is pretty basic , words are pronounced as they are spelled and there is n't a plethora of accents - just an occasional umlaut .

  i said that haddock with a poached egg is a traditional english breakfast - as are kippers .

  just a pity they 're so damn expensive . 
  fair point although i think i might have seen norwegian brie . 
  i 'm in bergen at the moment and am planning on going to the supermarket tomorrow to buy ( among other things ) cheese , so i 'll take a look . 
  back home in the uk much of what is sold as brie is domestically produced , so i would n't be too surprised to discover it was the same here . 
  are you suggesting that the tax on wine should be greatly reduced too ? 
  the selection of cheeses in safari is fucking apalling though - compared with a british , french or german supermarket . 
  the problem here is the effect on consumers , it will simply lead to even higher prices and less choice . 
  as the article states :  earlier this year , farmers ' dairy cooperative tine called for increased duties on cheeses that directly compete with jarlsberg and norvegia . 
  reactions by consumers led to the proposal being dropped . 
  i do n't doubt that jarlsberg and norvegia are pleasant enough cheeses in their own right , however if i go to the supermarket to buy cheese i 'd prefer a choice of more than two products .

  that last piece of legislation pretty much banned all modern hand-guns including .22 and smaller . 
  interestingly none of the legislation extended to northern ireland - although that 's part of the uk as well .

  in the uk the laws were substantially tightened following two mass shootings . 
  the first in [ hungerford in 1987 resulted in 31 casualties - including 16 fatalities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungerford_massacre ) - and led to the introduction of the [ firearms ( amendment ) act 1988 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/firearms_%28amendment%29_act_1988 ) ; and the second in [ dunblane in 1996 resulted in 32 casualties - including 17 fatalities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dunblane_school_massacre ) - and led to the introduction , first , of the [ firearms ( amendment ) act 1997 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/firearms_%28amendment%29_act_1997 ) , then later [ firearms ( amendment ) ( no .

  in answer to your question there 's a difference between being proud of your country and believing it 's better than all the others . 
  perhaps it 's because the right ca n't tell the difference between patriotism and xenophobia that they give the former such a bad name . 
  does n't surprise me that the mp insisting the bbc should play ` god save the queen ' was andrew rossindell . 
  i had the debatable ` pleasure ' of meeting him several years ago when he was running in the constituency where i then lived . 
  thoroughly nasty , jingoistic little englander through and through . 
  not very bright either . 
  many of those organisations calling themselves ` armies ' were n't organised , official armies either , but they were n't referred to as the ` so-called ' liberation army of judea or whatever . 
  thank you , that makes things a lot clearer . 
  not directly related to this story , but the following paragraph at the bottom about the recent train attack in germany attracted my attention :  the ** so-called islamic state ** later claimed the attack , releasing a video of the attacker who was shot dead by police as he fled . 
  i 've noticed the bbc do this every time they mention is . 
  i do n't remember them talking in the past about the ` so-called ' plo or ` so-called ' eta or ` so-called farc ' or ` so-called ' ira - or any other group for that matter , so what makes is special ? 
  i thought they were called ` islamic state ' because that 's their name .
