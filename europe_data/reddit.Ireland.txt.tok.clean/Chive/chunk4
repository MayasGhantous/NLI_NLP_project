  how would you define their gender knowing what you now know about them ? 
  is it their outward appearance , their genitalia or their attitude ? 
  did you not notice that nobody replied to [ my earlier post ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/yl016/this_why_i_dont_trust_swedish_officials_handling/c5wkou0 ) it makes much the same point . 
  [ this one as well . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/yl016/this_why_i_dont_trust_swedish_officials_handling/c5wlq83 ), 
  i could think of several better reasons to be gay rather than club prices , but whatever floats your boat . 
  different states do , but many are in different stages of legislation so as to codify it . 
  it 's fine to have a gender-reversal operation but often much more difficult to cope with the bureaucracy of something like applying for a driving licence , passport or medical card . 
  if you turn up in a dress looking like [ this - reasonably sfw ] ( http://cdn2.pornstarblognetwork.com/www.ladyboybenz.com//wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ladyboy-benz-dress-0.jpg ) but your photo id says that you are [ male - most definitely nsfw ] ( http://ladyboy-lover.asianlb.com/resources/images/ladyboy_benz_shoots_massive_stream_of_cum_1.jpg ) - then that 's where the discrepancy applies . 
  i doubt that in the examples i 've shown most doorstaff would try to double-check , but there 's a pressure on them not to be taken in by fake photo id - and if the gender on the id does n't obviously match that of the would-be patron , then they 'll want to make further enquiries . 
  it 's extremely unlikely - at least in my experience - that would involve examination of genitalia , however it still represents major inconvenience to the person wishing entry to the establishment . 
  as i said - there 's a process going on in some european countries where your gender on official documents is your expressed gender rather than your birth one and it 's legal to change them as you see fit . 
  it 's taking time but we 're getting there . 
  it 's not deadmau5 , it 's the operators of the venue . 
  does that apply to man-tits too , or only to vaginas ? 
  what if i wanted to go for a drink with [ buck angel ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buck_angel ), 
  that 's pretty much how it works here . 
  you 're allowed to do whatever 's not explicitly banned , but there 's nothing stopping the government banning whatever the fuck it wishes to . 
  the uk is a country run for and by the elite ; the proles know their place and get on with it - with little to no resistance as long as they are entertained - it 's the same policy that josef goebbels invented for the third reich - keep them entertained , slip the message in subtly , and they wo n't revolt . 
  the trick is working out where the path of least resistance lies . 
  that 's the only difference between our political parties . 
  they 'll push their own agenda as far as they can until it encounters an obstacle . 
  the biggest lie that we have swallowed in this country - outside of religion although the two can sometimes go hand-in-hand - is that politics is boring and somehow irrelevant . 
  that 's bullshit and by swallowing that lie we 've left the decisions which fundamentally affect every resident in the uk to a handful of unrepresentative wankers . 
  the second biggest lie is that politicians are worried about the lack of interest in politics and want to do something about it . 
  if it happened that the british people took a strong interest in the decisions which directly and indirectly affect them , then all of our elected representatives would be out of office and most , from parish councillors to members of parliament would be in gaol . 
  it 's unfortunate that the civil war was so long ago that its memory has long since died under a tsunami of apathy . 
  many other countries i think would do so , but i have more faith in sweden - and indeed most scandinavian countries - than i do in many others . 
  indeed . 
  i 'll have to take them off if i want to go to the gig . 
  or perhaps i 'll just mosey on down the road to the 24-hr biker bar and have a better time anyway . 
  happens - or at least used to happen - in the uk too . 
  i think there was a discrimination case some years back over the issue but not sure . 
  it has been a very long time since i went to a club . 
  pretty sure it 's [ illegal here now ] ( http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/discrimination_e/discrimination_discrimination_because_of_sex_or_sexual_orientation_e/taking_action_about_sex_discrimination.htm#direct_sex_discrimination ) , not so sure it does n't still go on . 
  not any more . 
  apparently sweden put a stop to extraordinary rendition flights back in 2006 . 
  ironically enough the [ original source for the story appears to have been wikileaks . 
  i see . 
  wish the uk had something like that in place too . 
  we do n't even have a written constitution here , so nothing setting out any explicit rights . 
  you seem to have omitted the first line of that paragraph . 
   extraordinary rendition provoked a diplomatic crisis between the united states and sweden in 2006 when swedish authorities put a stop to cia rendition flights . 
  there was a bad mistake made in 2001 about 12 weeks after the twin tower attacks , but since then it appears sweden has done a great amount to put its house in order in this regard - even going as far as to use undercover intelligence operatives to check up on what the americans were really up to and subsequently banning the cia rendition flights . 
  does the portuguese constitution have a ban on extraditing portuguese citizens ? 
  i know that some countries have that in place just not sure which ones . 
  i know that russia has a blanket ban on extraditing its own nationals and i think france and maybe germany do as well . 
  no worries , thanks for the link , i might need it in future . 
  i know how to do it that way , but i 'm looking for a better exchange rate and lower charges than my bank applies . 
  my bank 's strange . 
  it 's great for uk domestic things but not much use for anything else . 
  cheers . 
  i see the discrepancy between the mid-market rate and the rate i 'd get , but it 's not as bad as some other places . 
  i 'm shopping around to see what the best-value and safest option is . 
  thanks . 
  i 'll have a look at that . 
  thanks . 
  you 're right about travelex but i was mainly using them by way of example . 
  edit : signing up for an account with them now . 
  i 'll see how it goes . 
  it 's a bit more involved than that first company i found but that 's a good saving on the exchange rate and the amount i 'm transferring is quite close to that figure . 
  this online company appears to do it cheaper than my bank would , which is why i was thinking of using them . 
  that 's the plan . 
  i was thinking that i 'd use my bank debit card to send a payment to my friend 's bank account . 
   obiang 's lawyers say the avenue foch mansion belongs to the `` state of equatorial guinea not to the presidency '' . 
  obiang 's father has ruled equatorial guinea since 1979 and i would assume that he is , in the fine tradition of dictatorial kleptocracies , lined up to take over the presidency as heir apparent . 
  under those circumstances is there really any significant difference between state property and the personal property of the ruling family ? 
  i suppose the case could be made that it 's used for state functions in much the same way as an ambassadorial residence ; however i would have thought that it would be necessary to have made the french government aware that the property served such a purpose . 
  interesting to note that he has already had [ homes in south africa seized ] ( http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/equatorial-guinea-playboy-s-cape-homes-seized-1.266679 ) as well as [ similar action in the us . 
  ] ( http://www.globalwitness.org/fr/node/7833 ) with [ approximately 75 % of the country 's population living below the poverty line ] ( http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/countries/central-africa/equatorial-guinea/ ) despite the massive oil revenues , i 'm left wondering why equatorial guinea is n't subject to the same sort of diplomatic treatment as iraq under saddam hussein . 
   for years , the mountainous region straddling the border between afghanistan and pakistan seemed like a mecca of sorts for militants . 
  surely if they 're islamists the only sort of mecca would be mecca . 
  i 'm not sure i understand it either but i 'll give it a shot . 
  historically muslims and christians were at each others ' throats for centuries with accusations on both sides that the others were infidels and heretics . 
  a whole series of medieval wars between the sides in the iberian peninsula , middle east and balkans did little to improve matters . 
  do muslims accept the position of jesus as the son of god ? 
  no , and this is historically unacceptable to christianity in the same way that christian disregard for the role of mohammed is unacceptable to islam . 
  the situation then arises of two religions tending towards disparity but also competing for hearts and minds - as both are aggressively expansionist in terms of seeking converts and adherents - in close geographical proximity . 
  in such a situation it 's inconceivable to many followers that the competing religion could worship the same deity . 
  whether this is a position that would have been promoted if the ottoman and holy roman empires had n't been waging war with each other for so long is another question . 
  my suspicion is that it 's a throwback to a medieval power-struggle when each side was promoting propaganda that portrayed the other as heretics and barbarians . 
  possibly because of [ ongoing seismic activity there ? 
  ] ( http://earthquake-report.com/2012/05/18/the-2011-submarine-volcanic-eruption-in-el-hierro-canary-islands-spain-eruption-overview/ ) according to [ this report ] ( http://www.canariesnews.com/2012/07/03/el-hierro-update-page/ ) el hierro experienced several minor earthquakes on saturday 7th july this year . 
  while this is true , most christians have a strong aversion to regarding allah as being the same god . 
  its not the christian god in turkey which apparently has a belief rate somewhere around 90 %, 
  ca n't say i have . 
  last time i went there i had a great time and would love to return . 
  nearly all the major museums and galleries in london are free , you only pay to see special exhibitions same as you would anywhere else . 
  for really good beers check out [ brewpub.dk ] ( http://www.brewpub.dk/index.php?id=english ) near the city hall . 
  no free beer unfortunately but definitely the best beer i found in copenhagen . 
  the jacobsen brewery at carlsberg was a close second though , and the brewery there is sure worth a visit . 
  that 's a perfectly valid point . 
  most other anthems seem to be about the country or its citizens , not some hugely privileged individual whose ancestors were slightly better at fighting than someone else 's . 
  you never know . 
  it 's more identified with monty python than anything else now , and since there are few institutions more quintessentially british perhaps the american independence aspect could be overlooked . 
  not really . 
  i live in england and have done for several years . 
  it 's more that i think monarchy is an outdated form of government .
