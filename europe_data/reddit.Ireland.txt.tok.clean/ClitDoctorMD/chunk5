  greek is more like italy rather than turkey you see the examples you 're pick are countries that are geographically close thus its quite likely culture is similar between geographic neighbours . 
  however take places within the eu take are geographical distant and it simply doesnt apply , eg ireland and croatia , spain and latvia , lithuania and france . 
  the geographic distance angle is one that applies across the world and isnt confined to the eu , its simply a result of ethnicities living in one geographic location that was divided in two due to wars etc. 
   the culture of germany is and has always been much closer to the italian one , spanish one , british one rather than the chinese culture . 
  substitute germany with america , canada etc and the same is true . 
  you 've pick china which is a cultural extreme so to say that germany is more like france than china doesnt really serve your point . 
   he roman empire and the spread of christianity played a big rol in this , latin had many words derived from greek and now we have italian , french , spanish , portuguese and rumanian as main neo latin languages who derive from latin . 
  english has many words which originate from french , german also has some words which originate from latin , unlike any asian language . 
  language of course have roots in similar historic languages but that doesnt mean the countries themselves are similar . 
  to take the inverse example , the huns were a group of nomads from asia who came to settle in central europe , therefore the two have a same shared history however i dont think anyone would think central europe and asia have similar cultures . 
   we all celebrate the christian traditions in europe even if many are atheist , we for sure do n't celebrate any islamic tradition . 
  by traditions what do you mean exactly ? 
  aside from easter and christmas which are celebrated worldwide not just in europe i dont know what you 're referring to . 
   so yes there is a european culture . 
  we thats that settled then . 
  perhaps but that must be a new thing , i 've been to belguim , france , germany and holland in the past 12 months and havent seen it . 
  they reason we have an eu isnt to do with culture , it was to do with preventing war . 
  interdependence of france and germany was key to this , that is what the ecsc and later the eec secured . 
  it just so happened that interedependence led to economic growth , the process had nothing to do with culture . 
  the eu has tried to manufacture a culture with eu passports , an eu anthem etc but blatant constructivisation on the part of the eu has if anything led to a pushing away on the integration front . 
  its not that impressive when 1 in 7 people in the world live in china . 
  its 13 in ireland ... 
   what about schuko becoming the only european plug all jokes aside the irish/uk socket is much better than the european one as the longer prong is designed to get the current flowing . 
  this means it is much more safe that the european pin , especially in regards to little children messing with a socket . 
   we europeans started to have a common culture . 
  if you honestly believe this you need to take off your eu federalist glasses , to say that bratislava culture is common to say dublin is laughable . 
  there is no common european culture as much as the eu and some posters here would want you to believe . 
  fact is there is more in common between anglo-sphere countries ( uk , ireland , canada , us , australia etc ) than those countries and their european counterparts . 
   at present , the eu institutions have three working languages -- french , german and english - with the interpretation or translation of most meetings and documents into ** all 24 official languages ** . 
  unless of course that language is irish because our government signed that right away ... 
  yeah if everyone could learn english that 'd be great , yeah it sucks for a while but in a few hundred years you wont even remember you had your own language to being with , it worked great for us !, 
  usually from someone british - ` so are you from southern ireland ? ' . 
  no i 'm not , there is no such country as ` southern ireland ' , its ireland , just ireland . 
   the best union would 've been germany , uk , benelux , france and ** italy ** , that 's it . 
  the rest is either too poor , ** corrupt ** hmm ... 
  i 'm sure its a great consolation for people in crimea that the eu is great ... 
  the irish rangers which are our special ops are known to be pretty badass aswell . 
  the same thing that had been agreed upon twice already going back to the 1880s and hadnt been implemented ? 
  brilliant . 
   beef dont worry lads , we 've got this . 
  went to berlin and was surprised how respectful every pedestrian was of the road lights . 
  i mean you could be standing on an empty street at 6am without a car for miles and unless the light said you could walk they would n't walk . 
  this may just be an irish thing but when theres a gap in traffic we generally cross the road , regardless of the colour light . 
   ireland - i was the only pedestrian in the in the entire republic who respected traffic lights . 
  is it bad that when i went to germany i was shocked how even with no traffic on the group pedestrians would refuse to cross the road unless it was a green light ?

  ditto with the word terrorism . 
  terrorism as a modern conception is used against sub state paramilitaries , by most definitions it cant be applied to states . 
  essentially it serves to give states a monopoly on violence . 
  this will get a lot of love here from the federalists but honestly whatever way you think on the future of the eu i hope your opinion isnt based of a racist violent ex-host of a car show . 
  edit : just saying i 'd imagine is clarkson was pro brexit his opinion here would be dismissed out of hand . 
   the secretary of state may by order direct the holding of a poll for the purposes of section 1 on a date specified in the order http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/pdf%20files/nipeaceagreement.pdf, 
  its not been good per se for most people . 
  the ` recovery ' has been two tiered , the uppers classes feeling it more while theres a massive rural vs urban divide . 
  90 % of new jobs are created in dublin , rural ireland is dead and gone . 
  rural police stations have been closed and likewise with hospitals . 
  ah the green & gold kerry express line . 
   it 's when stormont calls a referendum and that 's that no its not , under the good friday agreement only the british secretary of state ( currently ms villers ) can call a unity poll . 
  you 'd have something like this i 'd imagine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89ire_nua, 
   northern irelander here ; he basically has to say this - his party sinn fein have refused to take there seats as mp 's in westminster ** for ages . 
  ** since sf was founded in 1905 they 've always had a policy of abstentionism . 
  i 'm not arguing that they arent represented proportionally to their population , they are , its something the uk parliament does quite well , the electoral system is a whole other issue . 
  but like i said i think you want ni to be more important than it is . 
  its 1.5 million out of a uk population of 60 million . 
  its so detached from the mainland in an economic and political sense . 
  i mean look at the big leaders debate last year , did you see sf , the dup , alliance party or the sdlp on it ? 
  no you didnt even though all had the same or more seats than the greens . 
  sf and the dup had more seats than plaid who were on it too . 
  in an identity sense the british identity is completely different in ni as it is on the mainland . 
  in ni its really a form of ulster nationalism than british . 
  would you want to be associated with the 12th of july parades ? 
  do you think anyone outside the bnp and national front identifies with that ? 
  i think you 're kidding yourself here , there is 18 seats ni in a parliament of 650 . 
  sf abstains so in reality there is 14 seats in a parliament of 646 , or 2 % of seats . 
  even if they all voted as a uniform block ( which they never do ) they would still be utterly irrelevant in the grand scheme of things . 
  the issue of irish unification is for many people an emotional one , economic arguments dont play a large part for most nationalists in northern ireland . 
  ni as a whole nevermind sf have zero relevance in a modern uk . 
  they 've called for votes repeatedly , but only the british secretary of state for ni can call a vote , sf and the ni assembly have no power to call a vote .

  http://www.rte.ie/news/primetime/2015/1104/739633-prime-time-cross-border-poll-test-page/ on the question of whether they 'd like to see a united ireland in their lifetime 30 % said yes and 43 % said no , by excluding the 27 % undecideds you arrive at the figure of 41 % of ni in favour of a united ireland , a decent starting point . 
   britian pick up the tab to fill the # 11 billion hole in the norths finances just on this issue , heres a post that dispells a lot of the # 11 billion ` hole ' . 
  it 's certainly an odd system !, 
  that act as ` caretaker ministers ' until new ones are elected . 
  so they just carry out the day to day running of the department , they do n't pass legislation or anything . 
  zero chance of another election being held soon , theres just no appetite amongst the public or parties for one . 
  but i wouldnt rule one out in the next 18 months . 
  what does all this mean ? 
  well every party will put forward a candidate for prime minister but none will command an overall majority so enda kenny and the cabinet ( even those who failed to get re elected ) will stay on as acting ministers until a new government will be formed . 
  so who will form a the new government ? 
  well to form a government you need a majority of the seats in the house so in the irish case that is 80 . 
  after the last election the parties have the following : fine gael 50 ( outgoing leader of coalition , right wing christian democratic party , sit with the ipp in the eu ) fianna f\u00e1il 44 ( right of centre populist party , tend to be social democrats in opposition and liberal in government , no seats in eu currently ) sinn f\u00e9in 23 ( socialist republican party , formally political wing of the ira , sit with the nordic left grouping in the eu ) labour party 7 ( outgoing junior coalition partner , claims to be social democratic , currently no seats in the eu ) aaa-pbp 6 ( an alliance of the far left socialists , no current meps ) social democrats 3 ( newly founded , name is self explanatory ) green party 2 independents 26 so as you can see we have a very fractured parliament currently , the most fractured in history . 
  both fine gael and fianna f\u00e1il come out of opposing sides of the irish civil war and have traditionally commanded 80-90 % of the votes with this election being their lowest combined total at 50 % . 
  policy wise not that different but are sworn enemies . 
  fine gael wants a formal coalition with 50/50 split of ministers and a rotating prime minster ensuring stability while fianna fail wants to support a minority government from the opposition benches . 
  fine gael are opposed to this as then fianna fail could bring down the government whenever it suited them . 
  similarly fianna fail do n't want to be a coalition partner of fine gael as it would copper fasten them as the smaller of the two parties . 
  well what about the rest ? 
  neither of the two aforementioned parties want to talk to sinn fein . 
  historically this position was due to the ira but it is increasingly obvious it ca n't last forever with sinn fein cementing itself as the 3rd largest party . 
  the ira disestablished having gone on its last ceasefire in 1997 and in light of this sinn fein support has risen from 1/2 % , to 14 % .
