  it 's about its relative power . 
  the funding its gets from the us means it has one of the world 's most advanced military systems and it is that which is important . 
  alan shatter has huge influence with the taoiseach ( prime minister for / r/europe 's sake ) enda kenny he was one of the frontbench who backed him after the attempted coup from richard burton in 2010 . 
  he 's jewish by birth so i 'd imagine that 's where his affiliation comes from . 
  it 'd imagine growing up in a war zone has a large amount to do with it . 
  i mean we 're talking about 60 years of occupation by israel . 
  if russia continued to occupy your country against the democratic will of the people do you think that people would just stand for it ? 
  it 's very easy for us in europe to pick holes are them but when you live in the world 's largest concentration camp you 'll find your patience wearing thin pretty quickly . 
  yeah you 're right i really do n't understand why were all recognise israel ... 
  not a chance with our current government our foreign affairs minister and former justice minister are both heavily pro israel . 
  i 'd imagine it 'd be part of any agreement that would have sinn fein in power . 
  it was a draw . 
  tell the people who live there that !, 
   ireland to repeal ** law ** giving religion special position in irish schools  ** rule 68 ** hey lets not let a little thing like facts get in the way of a good headline . 
  as frankie boyle pointed out , ` unionism is the belief that two similar countries are better together , unless those countries are in ireland ' . 
  the actual question was broken down more than the graph . 
   i 'd also like to add , it is not very constructive to say , that because it is n't legal that it is `` insane '' . 
  other people may have a different outlook on it as you . 
  some people would deem the woman 's choice to not carry the child , does not supercede the unborn child 's right to life . 
  thank you for having an open mind . 
  i swear some people are so intolerant , i 've been called a misogynist and catholic evangelist for not being in favour of open abortion . 
  similarly although i voted yes for gay marriage when i criticised yes voters taking down no posters and damaging them i was called a homophobe . 
  there difference is the state is responsible for speaking up for the party which can not speak up for itself , whether that be a baby in the womb , a 3 year old or disable people . 
  its not as simple as you are making out . 
  worth noting the opinion of the irish people , people are in general like myself open to limited abortion ( incest , threat to baby/mother etc ) but there is no appetite for full open abortion . 
  heres the result of a recent poll on the issue : https://img.rasset.ie/000b55a5-614.jpg, 
  you showed your bias in your first line , is a baby only a baby when it was born . 
  my aunt had a still born kid , 7 months old , the little thing had eyes , a mouth , hands feet the whole lot . 
  under no circumstances would i have described it as anything but a baby . 
  it takes two to tango but hey lets just ignore that shall we . 
  nothing quite like modern ultra liberals pretending that abortion is a woman only issue ... 
   working time ** directive ** directive being the key word , i.e. 
  not legally binding . 
  this is great for irish users , with the pound being so strong against the euro amazon.co.uk is just too expensive , this is a great alternative . 
  just an fyi the promo video for the metro is for the old system that was planned years ago and scrapped so this new plan may differ slightly from that outlined in the video . 
   ireland also left out north ireland , although i do n't know the percentages in that case . 
  this is way more complicated than we ` just let out north ireland ' . 
  nationalists won the majority of seats in places there but unionist violence and collusion with the british army ( see : [ curragh mutiny ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/curragh_incident ) ) saw ireland partitioned . 
  even after that election the ira had to fight a 3 year violent campaign to bring the british government to the negotiation table , something neither side in catalonia want i 'm sure . 
  even at that point ireland wasnt independent but rather was given a federal type parliament with limited powers similiar to what already exists in catalonia today . 
  essentially the comparison is apples and oranges , the two are completely incomparable . 
  pretty sure the north of ireland does n't do sunday shopping . 
  yeah take that britain !, 
  i find it interesting that ireland is a lot higher than other western countries . 
  i can only assume that it is due to an appreciation of our neutrality . 
  im not disputing there were other reasons either , hence why i said one of . 
  but i wouldnt be taking the opinions of a defunct unelectable party like libertas as being representative of irish public opinion . 
   it was ** one of the ** main reasons we rejected the lisbon treaty initially, 
   has n't claimed to be since the cold war yes we have , repeatedly . 
  it was one of the main reasons we rejected the lisbon treaty initially . 
  slightly bitter are we ? 
  is it ? 
  i 'm using a direct comparison to the topic being discussed ? 
  you do n't think germany has improved post unification ? 
  that does n't make it right though . 
  slavery was tradition too . 
  i 'd imagine like with german unification there would be a large block of eu money set aside to soften the blow . 
  romantic reasons aside the economic benefits particularly for ni and the border counties would be astronomical . 
  the whole north-west of the island has been chronically underdeveloped as a result of partition . 
  yeah this is the whole thing about brexit that not many people have considered . 
  i mean closing the border in ireland is much bigger than a trade issue , symbolically it is also a strong move . 
  nobody wants the irish/british armies manning the border again . 
  hopefully common sense prevails and we can come to an agreement to maintain the current status quo in the case of the brexit . 
  shocker as unionists in northern ireland say something mental . 
  thankfully the british government has never paid much dues to their suggestions . 
  i wouldnt hold your breath . 
  this year we in ireland are celebrating the centenary of the 1916 rising here and sought to get back a flag of one of the groups that fought in the rising . 
  the flag was stolen by the british army as a trophy in the aftermath of the rising and has been on display in the imperial war museum since the 30s . 
  we 've secured it back on loan for the year but it 'll have to go back to the iwm after august . 
  crazy to think we have to ` loan ' something that was stolen from us !,

  nomadic tribes of israel were there thousands of years ago , it was n't captured as such . 
  huh til, 
  scotland was a kingdom too , it would still be the united kingdom of great britain . 
  the uk was created by the 1707 act of union , ireland did n't join till 1800 . 
  if it was a uk wide referendum there would be a united ireland tomorrow , people in the uk do n't care for ni . 
  you 're a bit muddled up . 
  firstly westminster does have a say in the matter by virtue of the fact that only the british secretary of state for northern ireland can call a legally binding vote . 
  also as per the good friday agreement a vote on unification would take place north and south on the same day . 
  in fairness he 'd have a good hiding spot in londonderry seeing as nobody knows where that is ... 
  i call it ireland seeing as that is both the name of the state and the island . 
  the good times are back !, 
  you shouldnt take a politicians views as representative of the population . 
  people in ni vote for the dup because they 're unionist and hardline , not because they 're anti gay marriage . 
  i think that 's wrong . 
  i know a few people with dual passports . 
  also under the good friday agreement people living in the north can get an irish passport or a british passport or both of they so wish . 
  the irish state wo n't revoke citizenship for someone in the north if they get a british passport , that would be huge news if they did . 
  the dup actually have never signed the gfa . 
  they 've always opposed it . 
  the gfa was signed by the nationalist parties and the uup who were the largest unionist party at the time . 
  the dup signed the st andrews agreement in 2007 with sinn fein and that is the basis on which they are in government not the good friday agreement . 
  i do n't think most people thought of it in that much depth . 
  the dup are the main unionist party in the north and they backed the leave campaign so many of their voters did likewise . 
  general john maxwell is the man who ordered the executions of the leaders of the 1916 rising . 
  he 's commonly referred to as the man who lost ireland . 
  i do n't get this trend of calling ireland eire . 
  i know its the name of the state in irish but it just seems odd in an internet context where most people would n't recognise it . 
  the british government and the vast majority do n't give two shits about the north and its been that way for a long long time . 
  that 's actually a common mistake .
