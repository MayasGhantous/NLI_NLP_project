well , because john dee could n't tell fact from fiction largely wasppoker . 
  his other greatest hits include claiming britain discovered america and that the british empire was founded by king arthur . 
   ( long time no see wasppoker - i 'd thought you 'd given up trolling the irish here . 
  for those just joining us , wasppoker is / r/europe 's token anti-irish troll - legends have it that his origin involved a horrible accident where he became trapped in a tricolour for a month by immigrants resulting in a deep seated trauma and a burning need to tell everyone . 
  `` everyone one '' means every one of those countries is one of your closest allies . 
  not that you only have eu allies ... that aside : economically ? 
  ballpark 50 % of your trade sounds pretty closely allied to me . 
  militarily ? 
  the bulk of nato nations also sounds pretty close to me . 
  everyone of your neighbours is perfectly accurate as well . 
  it 's a remarkably simple presentation of a complicated situation . 
  not quite the same thing . 
  and if you fly your chair to the moon , you 'll have a space program too . 
   seriously , wishful thinking aside , when you unilaterally place barriers between yourselves and every nation ( ~ ~ bar switzerland i guess ~ ~ edit : turns out switzerland is also in the single market ) within 1.5 k km ... yeah , that 's definitely isolationist . 
   ** everyone one of ** your closest allies  to say they are ** all ** our closest allies these terms do not imply the same thing . 
   i thought it was a core subject in irish primary schools ? 
  am i wrong as is english ? 
  the only difference there , is more of our population speak one than the other as a first language . 
   you mean the government has n't involved itself in the proliferation of the irish language ? 
  this is what i mean about you not having a grasp of the situation . 
  the current government actually wants to remove irish as a core subject and the government in general is under fire for only paying lip service to the idea of irish as an officially supported language . 
  most gaeilgeoir these days are either from gaeltacht areas , community led gaelscoils or painfully picked up fluency after their school days were done . 
  i do n't think you understand the situation at all and i 'm not massively sure why you 're dragging the government into it ? 
  it 's hard to put it into words properly but you 've the wrong end of the stick on this . 
  that saying has more to do with understanding the common names of people and places as more than funny rote learned sounds . 
  it has to do with understanding why our dialect of english has funny turns of phrase , and what that strange saying your granddad used to say actually was . 
  when we lose irish , we lose those things . 
  so , it 's a little saddening to hear you dismiss it as some sort of screwed up nazi-ish national pride thing . 
  i 'm guessing you 're not from a country where you have anything to give you empathy with this situation - you probably have the same first language as your grandparents did ( which i do not ) . 
  unfortunately not as well as i 'd like to - mostly just where it intersects with my own country 's history . 
  : / it 's really interesting trying to read scots gaelic and manx as an irishman btw - you can really see the languages separated at different times . 
  scots gaelic is still fairly understandable with just weird spellings/shifts & phrasings making it muddy but manx is something else - i have to try to sound out everything before i have the slightest hope of grasping the word even if i know the english translation ( and even then most i ca n't get because they 're very different to the equivalent in irish ) . 
  do you get the same thing trying to read scots gaelic or irish ? 
  bizarrely , i 'm pretty sure it 's actually the exact reverse . 
  manx 's written weirdness is because the manx became literate in english or welsh first before developing a written form of their language . 
  they were trying to fit their language to a set of letters that did n't really match up to their own sounds , and had wildly differing sounds depending on where english had nabbed the vocab they were mimicking from . 
  in contrast irish and scots gaelic had the advantage of scholars who could both speak and write in irish so they had a much smoother transition from ogham to insular script ( with extra gaelic letters covering the extra gaelic phonemes ) and their different roman alphabet versions in the modern day . 
  no , it 'd be 40 % of our total electricity demand . 
  [ this ] ( http://smartgriddashboard.eirgrid.com/#all/generation?scroll=fuel ) is useful for visualizing the data . 
  take a look at the fuel mix and set it to month - renewables ( mostly wind ) made up about a third of our electricity generation this month . 
  i think you 're misunderstanding what i 'm saying a little . 
  there 's a whole pile of agreements between accrediting bodies worldwide - an irish educated engineer is as entitled to practice engineering in the us as a us educated engineer . 
  there 's literally no difference between the degrees as far as ability to practice in the us goes . 
  the difference is that a licensed us engineer wo n't automatically have chartered status in ireland and vice versa - unless they go become chartered in ireland ( or in the opposite case the irish chartered engineer gets their professional license in the us ) . 
  as for lawyers - us law degree holders also are n't able to practice law based on their education ... they also have to pass the bar exam . 
  you 're also reading into what it says about the california and the mass. 
  bar too much . 
  cali is n't experience based - it 's based in part on whether or not you were called to the bar elsewhere and are transferring . 
  just is n't covered in detail because it 's not really one of the bar exams people take when they go state side . 
  there 's always hoops to jump through in any unusual circumstance - but to take us back to our beginning , it 's hard to see `` foreign degrees and certifications really are n't worth a whole lot in the us '' as a valid statement if we can see clear examples where they 're seen as identical for the purposes of practicing protected professions . 
  also , yeah , it 's a little bit off topic but it 's probably better not to use first world in that case . 
  it has dodgy connotations , is n't accurate in this case , and is wildly outdated anyway . 
  just say prosperous or the like . 
  actually , in the case of engineering and medicine it definitely is n't up to the employer . 
  if you 're eligible to take the professional exams , you can take them . 
  for the majority of other degrees , it 's really always up to your employer even if you had a us degree as they have no special legal standing . 
  as for nyc bar , [ here ] ( https://www.lawsociety.ie/documents/career_support/154usa.pdf ) is the law society of ireland 's write up on it . 
  section 3.1 is what we 're talking about here . 
  if you fancy a more painful read , [ this ] ( http://www.nybarexam.org/rules/rules.htm#520.6 ) is the relevant bit of the rules of the court . 
  specifically paragraph 1 . 
  as for the english speaking bit , yep , i certainly have it easier in that regard ( though btw first world means nato aligned - which we are n't ) though there 's plenty of non-english speaking countries that have the same accredited status for both medicine and engineering . 
   foreign degrees and certifications really are n't worth a whole lot in the us ( to the point where you may very well have to go back to an american school anyway ) i 'm pretty sure you 're not right on this . 
  i know the professional degrees for my own country at least are recognized as equivalent to the us ones . 
  you need to take your licensing exams , but that 's a different thing ( that you 're not eligible for without the relevant academic standing ) . 
  i can say for certain that irish engineering degrees have the same academic standing in the usa as their us equivalent ( washington accord ) , ditto our medical degrees ( just need the usmle ) and our legal degrees are accepted for the new york bar exams ( i 'm pretty sure for the rest as well - but that one i know off the top of my head ) . 
  if you 're interested [ this ] ( http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~irlkik/ihm/index.htm ) is a pretty good set of info and maps although the sourcing is all over the place & it 's not the prettiest . 
  it 's a good place to find out a little more about where to start looking for info on particular names though ( from memory , it should have a key for sept/clan names cross referenced with the common modern irish name versions somewhere though i ca n't see it right now ) . 
  it 's always the way of it - until people 's attention is drawn to something , they 've not had a reason to look into it . 
  you mean province . 
  the county would be galway which is in the province of connaught ( not being pedantic - just good to prevent confusion down the road ) . 
  genealogy and surnames are one of those really interesting windows on history - if you tug on them for long enough you 'll end up reading about all sorts of eclectic parts of history you would n't otherwise encounter . 
  that 'd also make some sense - connaught is the province * where a lot of the native irish ended up after being forced off their land during the plantations . 
  seems weird that it 's there if the map 's supposed to be 1500s ( pre ulster and cromwellian plantations so before that migration ) but who knows ? 
  * ireland 's divided into four provinces ( old celtic kingdoms ) which each hold a handful of counties . 
  just grabbed [ this map ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3vlc-jnwxkc/trfwddy-u7i/aaaaaaaaaeg/y5pvcod0hmu/s1600/provinces+of+ireland.gif ) from google but it looks accurate to me at a glance . 
  well , the point i 'm making is that the 1911 census is too far from henry the 8th to be a good reference point here . 
  it needs to be based on something a little closer - and there 's an important reference document for irish genealogy that was written within a hundred years of this date . 
  part of the problem , bizarre as it sounds , is the process of anglicization of irish surnames was largely a case of whoever wrote it down decided what the name was . 
  which means that across ireland you ended up with a lot of different anglicized surnames that are actually the same original irish name , and a lot of identical anglicized surnames that are actually surnames with wildly different origins that got mangled in translation . 
  so , you have to be extremely careful in what you assume a surname means . 
  that 's complicated . 
  gallowglass in this case means scottish norse-gael mercenaries who settled in ireland serving the irish clans . 
  they were prized for their loyalty , skill and morale . 
  over generations , as the original gallowglass families married and recruited among the irish , and the term drifted into describing a type of warrior rather than a source of them - elite heavily armoured soldiers who fought with polearms like the sparr axe or other heavy two handed weapons . 
  they were basically the gaelic equivalent of knights . 
  i 'm not surprised - especially if it 's in the north of ireland on that map , you may well have gotten it through the scots who got it through d\u00e1l riata initially . 
  it shows up here as well - we occasionally have divergent versions of the same surname where one set was an irish surname that ended up in scotland and got reimported in a different form during the plantations . 
  bar the 1911 census ( which is n't relevant for the time period ) the rest of the data lacks citations . 
  this is n't great because the names of castles are not a good proxy for the actual locations of clans ( not every sept would have castles since they were a norman introduction and not every castle name relates to who actually held it ) . 
  on top of this , we 're talking about a period which is just before the writing of the irish book of genealogies - you 'd expect at least a citation or cross reference with its contents . 
  so , on the 1911 census , it 's not a strong data source here because the gap between the death of henry the 8th ( 1547 ) and the 1911 census includes , off the top of my head , the cromwellian plantation , ulster plantation , desmond rebellions , flight of the earls , introduction of the penal laws and two major famines . 
  all of those had serious impacts on where various surnames showed up and in what form . 
  if you follow it through it 's just a link to a site selling a print of the map - no sources given in it . 
  because they are two separate waves into ireland . 
  the vikings arrived around 795 , and the normans in 1169 . 
  well , the bigger problem is that our power system is too small for cost effective nuclear reactor designs . 
  give it a few years though and small modular reactors might start being a possibility , 
  i 'll happily read those when i get a chance ( if you happen to have links for them , that 'd be appreciated ) . 
  on the soul tax , are you familiar with the penal law tithes ? 
  quite similar except in that it was n't per man , it was per catholic - and it was for the purpose of supporting the protestant faith and along with mandatory subdivision of catholic held land holdings ( save if anyone converted to a protestant faith in which case they would inherit everything - and the other heirs nothing ) was part of the legal structure to force conversion .
