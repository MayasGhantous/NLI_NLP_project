no , i 'm saying that the molotov-ribbentrop pact was a byproduct of allied inaction and soviet opportunism . 
  the ussr offered a military alliance with the uk and france against the nazis just 8 days earlier and it got rejected . 
  if fianna f\u00e1il had any stones they would 've called the fucker 's bluff and told him to fuck off . 
  the ecb had no right to dictate fiscal policy to anybody . 
  oh , i know . 
  but democratic socialism is nonetheless socialism , it 's just a bit more ecumenical than other kinds and can be bended in a lot of different ways . 
  but it 's still meant to be solidly anti-capitalist . 
  but if you view social democracy as the centre and democratic socialist as the midway between trotskyists etc. 
  and social democracy , then yeah you guys make perfect sense . 
  just because the scale is linear does n't mean it has no variations or that multiple kinds of people can not sit on it . 
  anarchists are different to socialists yet both sit on the far left of the spectrum . 
  there 's more than one kind of `` far left '' , you know . 
  democratic socialism is not social democracy , if they 're actually democratic socialist then they 're pretty far left . 
   well for one thing , when they split poland down the middle . 
  and ? 
  where 's the alliance ? 
  or is it every time two different nations have done things to mutual benefit it is now an * alliance * ? 
  or is it just that you 're determined to rewrite history to make the western powers look glorious , pure and good ? 
  it 's because the military is seen as an extension of policy implementation and political maneuvering . 
  elsewhere it is used as a tool of expansion , aggression , imperialism or purely neutral defensive purposes . 
  though that is not to say the russian army is * not * any of those either . 
  when were the nazis and soviets ever allies ? 
  the funny thing is that this would have never been necessary had the western powers decided to help hitler along on his merry way and work against the soviets from the get-go . 
  ireland ca n't comply with the schengen agreement because it shares a border with the uk and has freedom of movement with the uk , which has come about from nearly a century of bilateral relations . 
  i do n't think it 's fair to `` ask '' ireland to also leave the eu . 
  not every country is the same . 
  forcing them to act like they are is disingenuous and a recipe for disaster . 
  more ? 
  it 's similar but different . 
  m5s is centre-left populist , and one of its main issues are the eu . 
  for example it teamed up with right wing euroskeptics as opposed to joining gue/ngl , which is essentially the big tent for the radical left . 
  podemos is more radical and the eu is kind of a sidepoint . 
  both advocate a more direct democracy , but in different ways , and podemos is supported by the much more radical elements in spain , like the syndicalist unions . 
  the more coverage corruption is getting in media , generally the more work is being done against it . 
  most left wing parties are either opposed to the union altogether or are in favour of a looser confederacy . 
  gue/ngl 's candidate , tsipras , advocated for the latter . 
  the only different thing about the two sets of propaganda is the attitude * you * have towards them . 
  they 're functionally identical , both send a message of hope - where putin is russia and ukraine 's last hope against the imperialist west , where obama is the hope for america , where they 're both seen as harbingers of peace . 
  you 're joking , right ? 
  no , i think the ** coast guard ** has a job that explicitly involves ** guarding ** a border . 
  what ? 
  where have i spoken about the government ? 
  are you intentionally misunderstanding what i 'm saying ? 
  thread : ** coast guard - `` we are opposed to the concept of open borders '' **, 
  open borders = redundant coast guard/patrol etc. 
  pretty straight forward concept . 
  you 're right but i do n't fully agree . 
  long before the iron curtain fell down , neoliberal policies were being testrun and enacted all across the world . 
  we can see with various puppet states across latin america , batista prior to the cuban revolution , the pinochet regime in chile , even thactherist uk and after anwar sadat got assassinated in egypt , mubarak enacted massive neoliberal policies . 
  the difference is that when the marxist-leninist/stalinist/state capitalist economic systems in the eastern bloc hit crisis in the late 80 's - for a variety of reasons - that , coupled with decades of political repression , the social safety nets were no longer enough to keep the populations content . 
  i think a lot of people who toppled the pact states did not do so to change the economic and social systems , but to change the political systems . 
  everything else was just a side effect . 
  to think , for quite a few decades north koreans had a higher quality of life . 
  i wonder how it all went so down hill . 
  well that 's how the modern capitalist system works . 
  we 've lost most of our growth potential , we 're stagnating . 
  we 're going to keep going in this boom-bust cycle and it 's only going to get worse . 
  and that 's not just my opinion on the matter . 
  what a shocker that the people who 's job it is to safeguard borders are actually opposed to the degradation of borders ... bad for job security . 
  the soviet union really bastardized socialism in a lot of ways and it just became an extension of russian imperialism . 
  a more industrialized russian empire , really . 
  lenin himself was in favour of `` national liberation '' , as we would call it . 
  from * the socialist revolution and the right of nations to self-determination * ;  victorious socialism must achieve complete democracy and , consequently , not only bring about the complete equality of nations , but also give effect to the right of oppressed nations to self-determination , i.e. , the right to free political secession . 
  socialist parties which fail to prove by all their activities now , as well as during the revolution and after its victory , that they will free the enslaved nations and establish relations with them on the basis of a free union -- and a free union is a lying phrase without right to secession -- such parties would be committing treachery to socialism . 
   there is tons of factually wrong stuff in this . 
  where and when exactly has israel done `` ethnic cleansing '' or `` mass murder '' ? 
  you 're kidding , right ? 
  what do you think the settlement process is ? 
  that they ask them nicely to please vacate the land and that if they get rejected then it 's no big deal and they 'll ask later ? 
  the settlement process is ethnic cleansing . 
  i guess you did n't pay attention to the last conflict . 
  or the one before that . 
  or the one before that . 
  or the one before that . 
  or the one before that . 
  or all the constant violence and oppression that 's been going on in between . 
  nope , that has n't been happening . 
   and israel also has not annexed anything , because palestine has never been an actual country . 
  at the time israel was founded the territory was under british control , before that the ottomans controlled it . 
  there simply has never been a palestinian state . 
  `` ukraine is n't even a real country , crimea has always been russian , we deserve that land ''  that obviously should n't mean that it has not been a misery for the native people that have been displaced , but speaking in terms of `` annexation '' and `` occupation '' simply makes no sense . 
  what do you call a unilateral military presence in a foreign land ? 
  a layover ? 
  occupation is , under international law , temporary . 
  annexation , which is categorically illegal under international law , is when foreign presence becomes permanent . 
  speaking in terms of `` annexation '' and `` occupation '' makes absolutely perfect sense . 
   how does one reason with extremists ? 
  a question the palestinians have been facing for decades regarding israel . 
  one would think that if israel were the democracy it claims to be , that if israel is the civilised society it claims to be , that israel , the more politically , socially , technically , and militarily advanced country would take a step and stop breeding extremism with its radical ultranationalism . 
  but they do n't . 
  because the government in israel is fundamentally no different to the government in gaza . 
  except israel has n't been under threat for ** decades ** . 
  every single neighbour bar syria is bought off or not interested in fighting anymore , and their treatment of palestine and their relations with syra and occupation of the golan heights are not related topics . 
  building increased settlements , ethnic cleansing , mass murder - none of these are signs of a country * anywhere * under * any circumstances * `` defending itself '' . 
  it would n't matter if we were in the middle of world war 3 , the actions of the israeli government , primarily in palestine , are not and never have been defensive actions . 
  they 've been acts of absolute unbridled aggression . 
  palestine as a region was economically self-sustainable and can manage ** perfectly fine ** when israel is not bombing it , blockading it , burning its fields , sinking its fishing boats , or occupying the very land itself . 
  it may come as a shock to a citizen of a country unaffected by war , but under the above conditions ** nowhere ** is an economically sustainable country , and to take a stance that we should not recognise a state as a result of that plays directly into israel 's hands . 
  if we are to state that palestine * de facto * `` does not exist '' then we must cease calling it an * occupation * and referring to it as an * annexation * , because an occupation is by definition a temporary affair , yet israel has not shown any interests in ending it . 
  buying the place i could see as vaguely possible .
