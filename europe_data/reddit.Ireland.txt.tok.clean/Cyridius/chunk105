   make their people think they 're all going to die and they will oust that fucker in 3 hours . 
  and you get this information based on what ? 
  make these people think fascists are all out to get them is only going to harden their resolve . 
  seriously , you guys seem to think that this is some sort of easy game where when one side swings their dick harder than the other that the other side gives up . 
  wan na know what russian military doctrine actively encourages ? 
  use of tactical nuclear weapons when conventionally outmatched . 
  so , yeah , if you think surrounding them with big guns is going to make them back down , you 're sadly mistaken . 
  the ussr went under those conditions for decades . 
  tell me why exactly we should escalate the situation ? 
  russia does not back down from escalations . 
  period . 
  they never have , they never will . 
  you can not scare a man in putin 's position into stopping . 
  you can scare him . 
  but it does n't mean he will quit . 
  this conflict is practically existential for russia . 
  if they admit * defeat * on this ? 
  they 're done . 
  their regional influence is no longer existent . 
  we need to deescalate the situation , allow russia to save face , and come up with an agreement that at least * looks * like it 's giving in to some russian demands . 
  that 's how the cuban missile crisis was resolved . 
  the whole play was aggressive on the ussr 's part , but the us gave something in return for them backing off , and it paved way for better future relations . 
  yes . 
  if he 's going to continue , let him . 
  right now pulling out all the bells and whistles to have our shit pointing east is n't going to give him a reason to stop escalating . 
  right now we need to cool things down . 
  if we match him move for move that 's not going to happen . 
  sounds like zhirinovsky alright . 
  if we want things to cool down we need to stop this posturing and military maneuvering . 
  putin 's a strongman , he wont back down from escalation . 
  [ do n't forget romania 's one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7e87aiu22q&amp;hd=1 ), 
  the problem is that all the power lies with germany , france and the uk . 
  all of us might as well be satellite states on the economic front . 
  tell me what leverage we 're going to have in a banking union ? 
  all policy will be dictated by germany and france . 
  strategy games are actually legit in learning that kind of stuff, 
  russia vs ukraine dota2 bo5 let 's go . 
  ukraine 's won the world champs in 2011 , russia gon na get fuuuucked . 
  i edited my comment literally 1 second before you posted yours . 
  they put a gigantic amount of money into the banking sector . 
  they spent . 
  by your own admission that 's keynesian policy . 
  yes , that policy was more geared towards spending on public works , but the bailout is another aspect of it . 
  edit : you know what , i 'm just being round about and refusing to admit i used the wrong word . 
  yeah , it 's not very keynesian . 
  yes , germany was pressured into the euro but there was no way that was going to happen unless we adopted german economics . 
  people seem to think that the causes of the eurocrisis are solely the fault of those countries which received bailouts ; primarily greece and ireland . 
  what people seem to forget that for each irresponsible borrower there is also an irresponsible lender . 
  what people do n't know is that it was * german * banks doing the lending , * german * banks had the highest amount of assets in ireland , and the second highest in greece and spain . 
  on top of that , during the years prior to the eurocrisis , germany was enjoying a very hefty surplus at the expense of the rest of the eurozone 's export industries . 
  it stimulated no domestic demand and it out muscled everybody else in intra-eurozone exports . 
  so while germany was benefiting from all those exports , it was doing so at the expense of those countries which it would be later bailing out . 
  it was * germany * that torpedoed the stability & growth pact , which would have prevented this whole mess in the first place , and massively undermined the maastricht treaty , which removed all pressure for any kind of fiscal responsibility from eurozone states . 
  * germany * broke the fiscal rules before any of us . 
  all i 'm saying is that there 's definitely more than one party at fault here . 
  when we fell over we expected germany to pick us up , not break our legs , give us a wheel chair then tell us we should be thankful for the service . 
  the loans we 've been given are nothing short of humiliating , and greece has it far worse . 
  neither of us have improved at all in the years since we were bailed out and all the austerity policies have done for us have dramatically reduced our quality of life . 
  when we talk about the european union , we 're meant to share the prosperity when things are great , and then share the burden when things go bad . 
  instead of sharing the burden , germany acted entirely out of self-preservation as opposed to any benevolence , and still have n't recognized their own responsibilities in the lead up to the crisis nor their own poor decisions during it . 
  we ( greece , ireland and any other bailout recipients ) are paying so that german banks can get off with as little harm done as possible . 
  we fucked up in a *** big way *** but we are not exclusively responsible for the economic situation we are in . 
  austerity is what * we * got . 
  what would you call the bailouts for the banking sector ? 
  meh , gb , ireland , and spain/portugal do n't use russian gas afaik , so that a ` int a problem . 
  why is it that economists and journalists figured this out years before the eu did ? 
  there was no `` misdiagnosis '' , only intentional ignorance and the unwavering demand to implement german , ~ ~ keynesian ~ ~ economic policies . 
  that is legit hilarious, 
  spying on your own citizens ? 
  a government that 's had the highest record of persecution of whistleblowers in american history ? 
  repeated suppression of hearings from other whistleblowers ? 
  and to top it all off , starting a global manhunt for him . 
  the * only * word that can sum up the us gov 's treatment of snowden and men like snowden is betrayal . 
  i do n't blame him for deciding to not become a martyr . 
  i 'm gon na be fair here ; western interests were a * catalyst * . 
  ukraine is a complicated country . 
  it 's essentially two countries mashed into one with very distinct political alignments and so on . 
  one side wants russia , the other wants europe . 
  the eu tells ukraine that it ca n't have both . 
  it ca n't sign any agreement with the eu and then do the same with russia . 
  which is justified , it makes things difficult for eu to work with ukraine if ukraine also has to mind its agreements with russia . 
  but the thing is , ukraine is divided . 
  it was poor political maneuvering , not malicious , but the ukr . 
  gov got forced to make a decision , either of which pissed off half of the country . 
  lose-lose . 
  and here we are . 
  so , it 's not that the eu intentionally exerted its influence to create this problem . 
  in fact , i do honestly think they realized precisely where the fucked up when they sent the three foreign ministers to negotiate , but the fact is european , western , interests , created a situation whereby there was going to be political unrest in ukraine , due to its inherent conflict with russian interests . 
  ... in their military bases . 
  the entire peninsula is not a russian military base . 
  [ full site here ] ( http://www.democracynow.org/2014/4/17/we_are_not_beginning_a_new ) if anyone 's wondering , democracy now is a left leaning website , i 'd say it 's slightly biased in favour of russia , but it 's generally ok . 
  personally , i think cohen is very close to the mark in his analysis . 
  `` republic of ireland '' , `` fine gael '' , 1939 , 68 `` republic of ireland '' , `` fianna f\u00e1il '' , 1926 , 20 `` republic of ireland '' , `` labour '' , 1912 , 34 `` republic of ireland '' , `` sinn f\u00e9in '' , 1905/1970 , 14 `` republic of ireland '' , `` united left alliance '' , 2013 , 2 `` republic of ireland '' , `` socialist party '' , 1996 , 1 `` republic of ireland '' , `` workers and unemployed action group '' , 1985 , 1 that 's the d\u00e1il eireann ( parliament ) counts , done out of 166 seats . 
  i can do the same for european parliament and the seanad ( irish senate ) as well if you want . 
  i could even do it on local level ( using a total of all local seats in ireland as opposed to going through each individual council ) which has a much more varied representation . 
  sidenote ; sinn f\u00e9in was initially founded in 1905 , thus making it the oldest surviving party ( dozens have come and gone in the past century ) , but it was split in two in 1970 over the drift towards communism , and became the worker 's party ( which initially kept the name `` official sinn f\u00e9in '' , it now has no seats in government on the national level ) and sinn f\u00e9in . 
  fall men . 
  se\u00e1n fitzpatrick got off . 
  `` we have no illegal military formations , they 're self-defense forces ! '', 
  it 's a sad day when people need to be bribed to defend their country from imperialism .
