  i thought they were a useful counterbalance to the us hegemony , but now i see them as so irrelevant they need to pick on neutral neighbours in order to assert their quickly dwindling legitimacy as a political power . 
  they wont use that . 
  aircraft like this are an intimidation technique . 
  it 's political suicide to use jets on dissidents occupying buildings in an urban area . 
  he probably thinks everyone behaves like the balkans . 
  jesus how many people is that ? 
  any idea what they 're chanting ? 
  austerity works , guys !, 
  hopefully there 's a full investigation and the assailants are charged appropriately . 
  right so you 're the third person here who has told me they suck . 
  what have they done to tarnish that reputation ? 
  he 's only person i 've given 27 legitimate downvotes to . 
  papal influence . 
  sorry , but being neutral and being in nato are mutually exclusive ideas . 
  you can not be both . 
  this is specifically why west-aligned countries such as finland , sweden , switzerland , austria and ireland are not in nato . 
  you ca n't just give a country equipment and say you fulfilled your obligations . 
  nato is a * military pact * and as such being a part of it requires a * military response * . 
  i 'll take the bet on scotland . 
  yeah , i 'm sure you 'll be right there with them kicking out those `` commies '' alright . 
  if greece stayed neutral in a conflict with any nato member they 'd be expelled from the alliance and its political weight nonexistent . 
  of course , it 's pointless discussing possibilities that will never happen . 
  nato has been saying that for years . 
  gallup 's reasonably accurate , and on top of that their polling uses scientific method with a good spread of demographics . 
  their questions are also varied , if you look at the poll op posted , so it 's not like they were loaded questions . 
  ouch . 
  yeah , that 's what i was worrying about . 
  pretty much . 
  i was gon na ask why they just did n't blow the tires on the yellow car when it stopped , but then i remembered .50 s are huge and there 's no guarantee that would n't hurt someone ... 
  though honestly if that happened they 'd be asking for it . 
  probably moving from one base to another . 
  is of best strategic planning !, 
  gallup is extremely reputable . 
   not here and not in the vast majority of europe . 
  mass-immigration did n't take off here until the mid-80s and was n't even considered remotely sane until the 70s . 
  prior to that the only documented case of immigration was a roughly one-thousand blacksmiths being taken in 500 years ago in preparation of war , more than half of which returned home within a year . 
  you keep referring to `` here '' , tell me where that is . 
  and on top of that , i would * love * to see sources that people only started coming to your country in large numbers in the 70 's . 
   then you 'd be talking from a point of view of benefitting yourself and your own ethnic group at the cost of the natives . 
  a hypocritical ethnochauvinist and a massive shill in other words . 
  you just like using words you do n't understand . 
  shill , again , we 've been over this . 
  ethnochauvinst , now that 's just telling of your inherently low iq . 
  people tend to use big words they do n't understand to try give their shitty arguments legitimacy . 
  you * do * know what the word chauvinist is , right ? 
   they 'd be ireland 's problem . 
  of course still far more easily employable than the vast majority of unemployed immigrants as well but that 's rather beside the point . 
  ok , why ireland 's problem ? 
  and what if those immigrants were american , british , or from any english speaking country ? 
  not to mention the tonnes of residency laws that prevent people from simply coming over here and claiming aid , so they * must * work , regardless of where they are from . 
   the basic purpose of states as made up by a people to do it 's duty and protect them . 
  you might as well ask why african states care about their native black ethnic groups or why israel cares about the jews . 
  i bet you 're the same kind of person that thinks africa 's a shit hole because its run by blacks , right ? 
  so , tell me , what about multi-racial countries ? 
  belgium , russia , spain , the united kingdom , the us , canada , australia , new zealand , and so on . 
  should they not care for all their ethnicities ? 
  or just the most populous one ? 
  or how about turkey ? 
  are they right to treat the kurds like shit ? 
   and pray tell what `` mere accident of birth '' is that ? 
  til babies choose where they are born  naturally . 
  that is a fact which applies to every society out there , state or no state , no doubt to your childish annoyance . 
  i suggest you read the universal declaration of human rights , some time . 
  it might be enlightening . 
   `` western '' civilization has nothing to do with it , most of historical western society would laugh in your barbarian face . 
  it 's simply you globalist scumbags who 'd like to turn europe , and only europe , into your summer resort and get upset when you 're told you 're not welcome . 
  my summer resort ? 
  hate to break it to you , you piece of shit , but i 'm born irish . 
   your kind of relativism is if anything the only ideological enemy of `` western '' society in the modern day . 
  hmm , let me see . 
  seeing as your entire comment is nothing more than grade-a ** bullshit ** laced with insults , allow me to respond in kind . 
  you are an ultranationalist , scumbag , piece of shit and your existence is a shit stain on society . 
  keep being absolutely detrimental to this planet and keep wasting good air , because frankly i will be enjoying every single moment that society progresses while reactionary fucktards like you keep futilely resisting change . 
  of course , you 'll never realize your own problems due to your sub-80 iq and it will always be the filthy barbarians ' fault !, 
  and if i 'm being insulted by racist fucks like you , i know i 'm doing something right . 
  you ca n't have a policy of austerity and job stimulus at the same time . 
  one is centered around spending as little as possible , the other is centered around spending until the economy is stimulated . 
   no , they 've killed themselves by deciding to try and cross the ocean in a boat that is n't seaworthy . 
  do you use that logic to justify murder ? 
  surely it 's their own fault , they did n't dodge all my bullets !, 
   wanting or hoping for something does n't make it a right . 
  nor does it make it wrong . 
  what is your point ? 
   if we let them in , they 're a huge drain on society because we 'd need to educate them before they 're useful , and feed them all the while because they ca n't get a job without education and knowing the language . 
  assuming all are either uneducated or unemployable . 
   why should it be our responsibility to help them ? 
  common human decency . 
  human rights . 
  trivial things , i suppose . 
  source on this ? 
  firstly , you have no fucking clue [ what a shill is ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=shill ) secondly , mass immigration was around * long * , *** long *** , *** long *** before the 70 's . 
  mass immigration of north africans into france started post-wwii . 
  then we start getting to countries such as the united states which has been an attraction for large amounts of immigrants since its conception . 
  i wont bore you with the details , it might go over your head . 
  and i just * laugh * how you essentially ask if i 'm `` one of them '' , as if being an immigrant makes me inherently diseased or something . 
  but what if i was an immigrant ? 
  what if i had a good education and filled a high skill job , like a doctor ? 
  what then ? 
  am i still a `` problem '' ? 
  ok , let 's say i 'm not a doctor .
