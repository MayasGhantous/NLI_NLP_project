  the likes of trotsky , who tried to push for more democracy , were politically undermined and deposed by stalin and his supporters before being exiled and eventually killed , and this was a pattern maintained by the soviet leadership after that point . 
  communism was never realistically on the cards . 
  if it was , they would have adopted trotsky 's theory of global revolution as opposed to accepting stalin 's socialism in one country . 
  marx himself was n't keen on going into detail on the `` getting to communism '' stage , only vaguely what it would look like . 
  he focused his energies on finding flaws in the capitalist system and providing a critique , and he never moved away from that in a notable way , other than his contributions to sociology/his challenging of hegel 's theories . 
  the dictatorship of the proletariat ( in terms of terminology , today 's liberal democracy would be considered a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie ) was the initial stages of a transition to communism as theorized by lenin and itself has had considerable opposition and criticism from the left over the past century . 
  you ca n't just tell people to `` read fucking engels '' one , they wont . 
  two , they wont take anything on board . 
  it 's like me telling someone to `` read fucking mein kampf '' - people think they know all they need to know already . 
  [ here 's a video of them beating people who disagreed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emk6qmvma3w ), 
  no , your idea that nato is a defensive alliance as opposed to a global hegemonic power used to secure its primary members ' interests is incredibly naive . 
  it has nothing to do with invading russia . 
  yes . 
  ireland during world war ii was just over 2 decades old as a state and not yet a republic and struggling to assert its independence as a separate entity from the empire . 
  it was in an economic war with the uk until 1938 and viewed the entire war as a failure of the world powers , and that smaller states should jot be involved . 
  it was not alone in this view ; denmark , luxembourg , norway , belgium and the netherlands were all neutral until they were invaded . 
  why would ireland join a war when nobody other than the germans were willing to deal in weapons ? 
  even then , ireland was a benevolently neutral nation and gave significant aide to the britain , and allowed its people to fill manpower gaps in the war machine . 
  the only real difference between ireland and denmark was that denmark was invaded . 
  a note that implied unity was on the table . 
  realistically there was no way it would happen , you ca n't force people to be part of a country and a post-war cabinet would have immediately backtracked . 
  unity is also not independence . 
  well the whole point was that we were trying to show we were separate from the empire . 
  you should understand that the struggle for total independence was still politically ongoing at the time . 
  we 're not in nato cus of northern ireland , though . 
  or that was the reason . 
  all the statistics were measured inin usd . 
  i thought about converting but decided i might make a mistake with the numbers . 
  because spain does n't want to play ball . 
  the uk treats separatism very differently to other countries . 
  constitutions are open to interpretation , otherwise there would n't really be need for judges . 
  shut up you piece of shit ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  i welcome an independent investigation on the issue . 
  i do n't believe there was any such genocide - or even ethnic cleansing - going on , but *** if *** there was even a mild possibility , then it 'd be good to research it extremely thoroughly and make sure that all the bases are covered . 
  so , yes , you are an islamophobic bigot . 
  you 'd have thought society would have raised you to be a decent human being , but i guess not . 
  so you 're an islamophobic bigot , then ? 
  oh , you mean cherry picking lines out of a book totally out of context is totally legitimate now ? 
  i guess i should n't expect high standards of critical thinking from people like you . 
  let 's break down this bullshit quote by quote . 
  `` kill the unbelievers wherever you find them . '', 
  is not in the qur ` an . 
  in fact , in the preceding passage of the qur ` an 2:190 , it says the following ; `` fight in the way of allah those who fight you but do not transgress . 
  indeed . 
  allah does not like transgressors . '', 
  it literally says `` fight in self-defense and leave other people alone '' . 
  ------ `` make war on the infidels living in your neighborhood . '', 
  is not in the qur ` an . 
  it is a passage on how safeguarding islam is not something simply done in the battlefield , but is done at home as well in winning the hearts and minds of the people . 
  ------------- `` when opportunity arises , kill the infidels wherever you catch them . '', 
  is not in the qur ` an . 
  it is a passage about the polytheists , whom the muslims at the time were at war with , and it says `` kill them where you may find them , but if they repent , give * zakat * and pray , and let them go their way '' . 
  i 'm assuming you do n't know what * zakat * is , it 's one of the five pillars of islam and it 's essentially social welfare . 
  the first welfare states of mankind were established in the 7th century , under that principal . 
  ------------ `` any religion other than islam is not acceptable . '', 
  is not in the qur ` an . 
  `` the jews and the christians are perverts fight them . '', 
  is not in the qur ` an `` maim and crucify the infidels if they criticize islam '' is not in the qur ` an ------------------ `` punish the unbelievers with garments of fire , hooked iron rods , boiling water melt their skin and bellies . '', 
  - this is an incorrect paraphrase , but in the qur ` an it 's a fucking description of hell . 
  good job , / u/viking83 ---------------- `` the unbelievers are silly urge the muslims to fight them . '', 
  is not even a sentence , but is similar enough to what 's there . 
  the passage describes that 20 believers would overcome 200 nonbelievers , and as such instead of running for the polytheists trying to kill them - muhammad was urged to fight . 
  in case you forgot , the muslims were violently persecuted and almost all passages related to violence against nonbelievers are specifically orientated towards these people - the polytheists . 
  ---------- `` muslims must not take the infidels as friends . '', 
  is a misquote . 
  it says ( me paraphrasing ) `` do n't take non-muslims as allies over muslims , except when it is absolutely necessary and prudent to do so '' . 
  it says absolutely nothing about personal friendship . 
  ------------ `` terrorize and behead those who believe in scriptures other than the qur ` an . '', 
  is not a passage . 
  the passage that is there describes that believers should guard against the word of satan and that those who betray islam for satan will have terror instilled in them and their necks and fingertips stricken . 
  so while their is an element of violence to this , there is nothing in this passage at all about telling muslims to go out and behead people , it is a direct quote from allah . 
  the reasoning given for this punishment in the * following * passage ( because trying to have context would be simply * too logical * ) is not simply that they disbelieved , but that they actively * opposed * allah and his messenger and worked to undermine them . 
  ---------- `` muslims must muster all weapons to terrorize the infidels . '', 
  is simply a misquote intended to fit an agenda . 
  the actual full passage is as follows ; `` and prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war by which you may terrify the enemy of allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know [ but ] whom allah knows . 
  and whatever you spend in the cause of allah will be fully repaid to you , and you will not be wronged . '', 
  the word `` terrify '' is used once , in which it is that your military might and faith in allah is to strike terror in your enemy on the field of battle . 
  so , i 'm so * terribly * sorry that i played the `` muh context '' card , it just so happens that * context is pretty fucking important * . 
  yeah , i noticed after i posted : /, 
  yeah , trying to associate the flag of europe - not just the eu - with a brutal , authoritarian regime responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths and extreme suffering is really an appropriate thing to do . 
  why do n't we just compare the american eagle with the nazi reichsadler while we 're at it ? 
   if you need me to inform you on the problem muslim immigration has created for europe , i do n't think we have much to talk about . 
  how are economic and humanitarian migrants meant to reflect badly on islam ? 
  what islamic practice have they taken part in that has specifically done bad to europe and `` europeans '' ? 
  and explain to me , explicitly , what precise problems it is that `` muslim immigration '' has caused that is explicitly , entirely , 100 % the fault of the migrants , and explain to me the negative intentions of these migrants ? 
   why are you so keen on defending religion and religiously motivated crime ? 
  why are you so keen on not knowing anything about what you 're talking about ? 
  name a single crime that i have defended in this conversation . 
  just one . 
  should be easy . 
   i never said i did n't read it for someone who 's pretending to know about it , you sure are dodging a simple yes or no question . 
   sorry , the qu '' '' '' '' '' '' ran mature . 
   i said i do n't want the quran to form the basis of the judgment of islam 2014 . 
  so you do n't want the scripture from which all interpretations and derivatives of islam are created , to be used as judgement for islam ? 
  sound logic . 
   i let the actions of muslims 2014 form the basis of the judgment of islam and to be frank ... it 's not going very well . 
  not going well based on what ? 
   what does it matter if i did or not ? 
  how is this even a question ? 
  how can you even pretend to understand something when you have n't even read it ?
