  yes , it does appear that the sky , is in fact , up . 
  i do n't get why people think this is some grand power play by the eu . 
  they offered a trade agreement to ukraine . 
  it got rejected . 
  the people were pissed , they protested . 
  * ukrainian * police shot * ukrainian * protesters and as a result the * ukrainian * president got overthrown by * ukrainians * . 
  i do n't see where either russia or the eu came into this internal affair until the * russians * invaded crimea and the * russians * annexed crimea against the will of the * ukrainians * which the * eu supported * . 
  the european union , compared to the russian federation , has played an * extremely * passive role in this entire affair and worked repeatedly as an intermediate between pro and anti government . 
  the plan the * european union * drafted involved keeping the pro-russian yanukovych . 
  so when people tell me that the eu always had this plan to own ukraine and that they 're equally to blame for this whole mess and that they 're just as imperialist as russia but they 're just much more sneaky about it , i do n't know what the fuck they 're talking about . 
  til military = literally criminal, 
  there 's actually no nuclear weapons in orbit . 
  russia 's had plans for war with sweden for decades . 
  ukraine should do itself a favour and invite un observers in all its contested territory so that russia ca n't just start showing up and start chipping pieces off . 
  surely a rectal smasher is attracted to gayness . 
  there 's a *** drastic *** difference between the size and scale of the kiev protests and the * few dozen * armed gunmen seizing a building in one city and a few hundred breaking into a few buildings in another . 
   everyone wins ... 
  except the ukrainians .

  [ reminds me of a rather relevant stage in irish history ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/easter_rising ) i can only say to ukraine is that they should be careful . 
  handle it with too heavy a hand and you can create far more problems than you fix . 
  there 's no need to throw away the racism , that still works . 
  it 's funny because luxemburgians are a branch of communist . 
  not really , let 's be honest . 
  you could argue france , the uk , poland , the us ... 
  but the rest ? 
  i doubt they dictate any kind of policy . 
  grey = not nato teal = nato red = russia gold = russian sphere of influence, 
  italian politics is funny . 
  personally i prefer the [ four provinces ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/four_provinces_flag.svg/800px-four_provinces_flag.svg.png ) and [ fenian revolution ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/the_fenian_flag_%281858%29.svg ) flags . 
  i would be up for a new flag . 
  the tricolour is kind of boring . 
  the uvfs one condition on cessation of activities was that the will of the majority always be followed . 
  the internet is n't an american invention . 
  get out . 
  does nobody care for the workers ? 
  for the most downtrodden an unrepresented ? 
  these people have been the true victims of the economic crash and yet they are being the ones punished , not the governments and upper classes responsible . 
  yeah , let 's forget about all that territory that russia already stole . 
  it rotates regularly . 
   government is promising to start killing people [ 20 ] ( they 'll reanimate death sentence ) if it will be excluded from council of europe ; tl ; dr if we get excluded we 'll start killing our own people ? 
  we 're metric in ireland . 
  imperial is used colloquially . 
  economic libertarians aka fuck the middle class and workers in particular ? 
  no thank you . 
  i fucking hate it . 
  i hate that socialism has been hijacked by fake socialists . 
  there 's nothing * socialist * about this . 
  that 's where we 're talking about . 
  if you 're going to respond please read . 
  it 's amazing i never heard about this . 
  i highly doubt it . 
  europe would intervene in that kind of situation . 
  wait , you actually formed a human chain from one part of catalonia to another ? 
  fuck , that 's dedication . 
  indians/pakistanis etc. 
  are formerly of the british empire , the commonwealth . 
  eastern europe has never been under their dominion . 
  most foreigners sympathize with the nationalist cause , eastern europe moreso than others due to their past experiences under the ussr . 
  had the boundary commission done as was promised to us by lloyd george we would have had a united ireland in the 20 's when the north realized that it could n't economically survive . 
  we were meant to get all the catholic majority areas back , and when those catholic majorities elected nationalist councils in their areas , they actually attempted to split off from the north and rejoin the south of their own volition , because they had effectively been abandoned . 
  of course , our government did n't accept these councils ' oaths of loyalty to the republic and after the unionists restored order , they made sure there were never nationalist councils again . 
  who is `` our '' ? 
  our governments , our banks , our businesses ? 
  it is undoubtedly true that many `` ordinary '' people did spend beyond their means , but many have been burned because of what `` more important '' people have done . 
  canada , america , australia is where irish people are going . 
  places with jobs for them . 
  it 's hard to get a record of the unemployed when there is a gigantic rate of emigration, 
  when there is nobody to speak for the downtrodden then it is no surprise when they act with violence, 
  `` very well '' is putting it extremely generous . 
  our politicians have no savvy and are slaves to higher powers . 
  our working class has been stomped into dust , and our middle class not much better . 
  the only people ireland is going `` very well '' for are corporations and the politicians enslaved to capitalist interests . 
  the quality of the video is so bad i actually did n't notice that . 
  abolish the commission and shift all power it had to the ep . 
  the president of ep could be removed . 
  and i do n't know why we have so many councils . 
  not in the us , they 've gone far past the point of diminishing returns for government investment in healthcare . 
  bloated bureaucracy dominated by corporate interests only goes so far . 
  a roundabout way to do it , but i can see the logic . 
  it 's got it 's pros and cons . 
  major cons being that we lose a european powerhouse and a significant economy . 
  pros , we do n't have someone trying to divide and undermine the eu from within . 
  they kind of do . 
  east asia is a hotbed of unresolved conflicts fueled by ideology . 
  the us has already has to stop s.korea , taiwan and japan from arming themselves with nukes . 
  [ at least they do n't kill you for it anymore . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/mzorpbiakcg?t=3m45s ), 
  clegg , for the love of god why are you debating him . 
  all you 're doing is giving his views validation by drawing attention to him . 
  threats are one thing and generally empty , annexation of territory is very real . 
  our labour party does n't act like a labour party .
