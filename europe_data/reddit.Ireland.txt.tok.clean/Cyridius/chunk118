  the time factor is n't the deciding factor in a violent uprising . 
  the time factor is a deciding factor in a democratic negotiations , as it readily displays that things have been thought through , both sides have had significant time to plan their yes/no campaigns , the local governments can prepare for independence and the local population has time to prepare . 
  not election or referendum or any democratic process can be sufficiently prepared in such a short period of time . 
   it is interesting how you quote nato reports , as if they were objective and have the purpose of determining the truth . 
  the truth is that nato countries benefit from the kosovo independence , since they found an ally in kosovo and since a usa military base bondsteel is located there . 
  usa and its allies have no benefits from crimea entering the russian federation , and that is the only reason it is against russia 's efforts to allow crimea to join the federation . 
  un = / = nato . 
  one has 2 letters , the other has 4 , not easy to mix up . 
   now , since obviously you claim that being terrorised by another nation is reason enough for claiming independence , should serbs be allowed to claim independence in parts of kosovo they inhabit , since they are victims of terror by the albanian majority , and fear their safety ? 
  if that is the case ( the kosovo constitution provides specifically for protection of minorities ) , then absolutely it should be put to a referendum , with negotiations between the serbian government and kosovo , and arrangements should be made . 
  of course , you ca n't negotiate with what you refuse to recognise . 
   why would n't you want the will of the crimean majority to be respected ? 
  is it necessary to bomb a nation first before a region is allowed to separate ? 
  because the `` will of the crimean people '' is not represented with a foreign invasion force occupying it . 
  i do n't see how this is difficult for people to get . 
  what the fuck, 
  / u/user _ history_bot cyridius ohhh , i wan na try this, 
  babies have died from that disgusting ritual . 
  only a monster would support this . 
  it 's individual preference and a discussion that 's not even relevant to the topic at hand . 
  great account . 
  i love it . 
  everyone totally took the bait . 
  that sounds hilarious . 
  the minority language bill did n't pass . 
  just scaremongering from the russians . 
  not to mention the context of kosovo/crimea is n't even close . 
  nato forces were in kosovo on a `` humanitarian war '' mission , which was vindicated in 2001 when the un found there was a `` a systematic campaign of terror , including murders , rapes , arsons and severe maltreatments '' by the yugoslav forces . 
  nato troops were clearly identified troops , with uniforms and badges . 
  kosovo was a un mandate for a transitional period , with a un task force ( kfor ) there to maintain peace . 
  not to mention the kosovo war started as an armed struggle by kosovars , * for * kosovars . 
  nato did n't ignite it , nato did n't fabricate it . 
  on top of this , both kosovars and yuogslavs were committing war crimes on one another . 
  and on top of this , this was over the period of years , with a backdrop of violence , where one country was fighting for * independence * , not annexation by a foreign military force . 
  now , compare this to crimea . 
  no violence , especially of the ethnic nature . 
  no violent rebellion by crimeans for independence . 
  then out of nowhere , unmarked russian troops invade and take over the infrastructure . 
  then the crimean government gets ousted and in place a pro-russian government ( which held ** 4 % ** of the popular vote ) was put in its place . 
  then that 4 % government announces a referendum . 
  all ukrainian forces , who were entirely a neutral force in the political unrest - *** entirely different *** to yugoslavia - are trapped in their bases by the russian troops . 
  then the referendum is held , where both options are essentially to join the russian federation . 
  all in a period of 2 weeks . 
  not months , not years , * weeks * . 
  all of this , with no prior popular call for independence from the crimeans . 
  kosovo became independent in 2008 after * nearly a decade of oversight * with widespread international input on their constitution and negotiations between kosovars and yugoslavs ( and later serbians ) . 
  yeah , it was a unilateral declaration , but it has always been the will of the majority . 
  it ca n't be compared . 
  i do n't know how anyone who has any kind of brain can make a comparison with kosovo in regards to crimea . 
  the similarities they share are ... nil . 
  non-existent and totally fabricated . 
  austerity was a success here . 
  we still have tonnes of problems ( such as emigration , huge issue ) , but it saved us from worse . 
  the problem with austerity is when it 's done in half-measures . 
  you get all the negatives with none of the benefits . 
  what 's the education system in spain like ? 
  do all the young people have skilled qualifications ? 
  the russian military tech is almost entirely all old cold war tech and their military is almost entirely conscripted . 
  they 're not a scary force , just numerous . 
  the country 's too poor to invest in it . 
  a well planned defense from a professional military would be an extremely costly attack by the russians and i do n't think they 'd go through with it . 
  crimea is obviously lost , i think we all need to get ready to redraw the borders on the map , but in a war scenario ukraine and absolutely put up a fight , especially with western aid . 
  they 're probably just trying to sell their support at a bit more cost . 
  a nice bit of funding or some nice equipment in exchange for recognising and supporting russia 's ukraine gambit . 
  do n't think of it as voting in your country , think of it as voting in your constituency . 
  this is how most elections work . 
  it 's a bit early to tell , there 's a lot of misinformation out there . 
  but russia does have special forces geared towards terror ops and infiltration into enemy countries . 
  on / r/nottheonion, 
  it 's warming up to russia . 
  the inclusion of russian speakers kind of makes this useless . 
  fair enough . 
  i admit my mistake then and that my views on this particular point were misinformed . 
  by creating a split between gaza and the west bank with illegal settlements ? 
  [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/un_palestine_partition_versions_1947.jpg ) is the 1947 border as of the 1947 un resolution and it demonstrably shows continuity in both israeli and palestinian territories . 
  i do not consider the creation of an israeli state in of itself illegitimate , however the current borders are as a result of conquest and occupation , which the western world generally recognizes as an illegitimate form of territorial expansion . 
  russia ( as the soviet union ) was doing this long before now . 
  letting the americans in now would pave the way for future transatlantic monopolies . 
  no thanks . 
  downvote troll guys , ignore it . 
  no need to worry , we 'll cooperate . 
  wait , so you 're blaming the ** eu ** for giving you money because ** czech ** politicians are corrupt ? 
  so instead of blaming the czechs , who are doing all the stealing , you 're blaming the eu . 
  your attitude is essential to the peace process !, 
  keep up the good fight / s, 
  the gaza strip is one of the most densely populated areas on the planet . 
  given israel forcibly separated them from the west bank , they ca n't exactly move around . 
  because contrary to popular beliefs arab countries do n't give a shit about palestinian people . 
  they all hate eachother and the only unifying factor is their dislike of israel . 
  nobody wants to pay out of pocket to house the refugees or help in the rebuilding effort . 
  great way to foster discussion . 
  i was n't going to downvote , but now i will . 
  what 's the point ? 
  israel will just blow it up . 
  do n't know why i 'm getting downvoted . 
  the next time hostilities occur , israel will just bomb it , as they always do with infrastructure in palestine , and then claim that there were `` bad guys '' there . 
  what happened in the 18th century has absolutely no bearing . 
  there have been major societal , cultural and population shifts in that time period . 
  what happened in the 20th century is still very recent . 
  russia is the successor state to the soviet union - it has inherited all the agreements with the soviet union , it can also inherit its past , especially as the soviet union was primarily russian in nature .
