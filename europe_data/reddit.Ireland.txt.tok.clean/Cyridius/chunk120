  i would see greater leniency . 
  as in , remove `` probably cause '' - if i want to own it , i want to own it , reasoning should be irrelevant . 
  on top of that . 
  i would see mandatory training courses introduced ( as of now there are none which is why so many accidents happen with firearms in places like the us ) . 
  in ireland for example we also have gun safes and it 's mandatory to own one of the proper size and type before we own * any * guns . 
  screening is already done in the us , and in ireland and i 'm sure most countries . 
  i would have no firearms registry so that the government would n't know whether or not i had a firearm or not , or if they did know it would not specify how many or what type . 
  alot of people laugh at the whole `` fight against tyranny '' deal , and i do n't blame them . 
  it 's far fetched , not likely to happen in my lifetime or even my children 's lifetime , and it 's just so out of this world when you think about it . 
  but after ukraine , or any of the * dozens * of countries around the world that have at one time or another in recent history slid from democracy to tyranny to dictatorship , it 's plain for everyone to see that it can happen anywhere . 
  i 'm saying the right for both me and my property and anyone else staying in my house to be safe on my property supersedes a person 's life when they enter my property with malicious intent , either to harm me , my family , my guests , or anything i own . 
  absolutely , yes . 
  they put themselves in that situation . 
  i would n't shoot a person without warning them , obviously . 
  the threat of a firearm is more than enough to scare people away . 
  i would call the law enforcement , i would then get my rifle , and i would hunker down in a safe place , preferably upstairs , and if the home invader made their way to me i would announce my presence , that i was armed , and that i would shoot . 
  after that the ball is entirely in their court and i 've done everything by the book . 
  firearm is a deterrent . 
  a criminal - regardless of whether or not he 's armed - is not going to put his life on the line for a tv . 
  the threat of a gun is enough to stop most people in their tracks . 
  absolutely , i 'm about to head out now but i 'll attach a reply to your comment later today . 
  `` practically always '' - all you need is one time and they have you cold . 
  if i own a firearm and i 'm in my own house i have the advantage no matter what they bring . 
  so your argument is that someone who is breaking the law by stealing from me , or otherwise harming or attacking me , should be allowed to do so because if i resist * they * might get hurt ? 
  where 's the logic ? 
  people should n't be killed over material goods . 
  people should be killed over intentionally seeking to harm other people and those people who they are harming defending themselves . 
  i do n't really like / r/guns , it 's an ok sub . 
  i did all my research on my own . 
  i think the american model of firearms ownership is flawed to a certain degree but the fundamental concept of each man or woman has the right to own a firearm for whatever reason - self defense , a hobby , security , or to fight a tyrannical government ( which we should all know can very much happen anywhere ) , i think these ideals are extremely important . 
  it 's not like the us is unique in this , many european countries allow ownership of firearms for self-defense , they just do n't have the * right * to have them . 
  or maybe if i have a gun they wont be braindead stupid and they 'll go pick a safer target . 
  furthermore if i have a gun and they have a gun i have the homefield defensive advantage . 
  i know my house , they do n't . 
  sorry i 'm not of the belief i should let criminal thugs steal from me . 
  nope , self-defense is not suitable cause for rifle ownership . 
  i own my rifle for sports shooting , which is how it sees its daily use . 
  however my beliefs towards firearms is what lead me on to that hobby . 
  well why should i ? 
  it 's my house . 
  and that 's assuming there 's even a way out . 
  what if i 'm upstairs ( where i should be in a home invasion if i value my safety ) and he is blocking the only exit ? 
  creating a eurocorps would involve the dismantling of domestic militaries for anything other than defensive purposes or police actions . 
  it 's too costly to maintain two separate and equally effect armies . 
  but forcing a surrender at all could be impossible with a nuclear trigger . 
  they invade ukraine , ravage it , kill millions , then we beat them and ... ? 
  what , we all just put away our weapons now because there 's an insane man with a nuclear trigger ? 
  i 've been robbed just about once , by two people . 
  at knife point , and also someone who was using what looked like a pellet gun . 
  in ireland , actually . 
  actually it is . 
  crime rates in areas with high gun ownership density in the us have overall lower crime rates . 
  on top of that the use of , or threat of , privately owned firearms stops an average of 1.65 million crimes every year . 
  and on top of * that * , 8 in 10 of those incarcerated in the us for a violent crime said they would not have committed the act if their victim was armed . 
  you 're justifying no firearms because it means burglars are more inclined to rob me because it 's easier and safer , therefore i wont get hurt ? 
  i 'm pretty sure i get to keep all my stuff * and * i wont get hurt if i shoot the stupid fucker that tries to break into my house . 
  which is entirely true . 
  or it could 've been prevented if that mother locked up her firearms better , as she absolutely should have been doing . 
  or it could 've been prevented had you had an adequate mental healthcare system . 
  which , honestly , is the * real * discussion america is afraid of having , it 's disgustingly bad healthcare system , primarily in mental health . 
  much easier to scapegoat guns . 
  i find it stupid , hilarious , and saddening all at once that people still scapegoat firearms for * people * being bad . 
  a weapon is a tool . 
  a knife can be used to cut food or make dinner the same way it can be used to stab someone , and in the same vein a firearm can be used to stop bad people doing bad things as it can be used by bad people to do bad things . 
   in europe , it 's freedom from having to worry about guns . 
  why not both ? 
  i own a rifle . 
  i live in ireland . 
  we have almost no gun crime ( about 5 or 6 murders a year with a firearm , if even . 
  though it is on the rise , i believe ) . 
  i value my firearm highly . 
  i think it is essential to my autonomy as a human being with a right to self-defense . 
  in the case of a home invasion i 'd rather hunker down in my room with a rifle than with a baseball bat when i face a man with a pistol ( or any weapon for that matter ) , or cower up in my room and wait for unarmed garda\u00ed to come to my house 10-20 minutes later only to find out i 'd been gutted and the guy left my house ages ago . 
  justice does n't do me any favours when i 'm cold in the ground . 
  i think europe is superior to america in pretty much every way . 
  every way , except the *** right *** to bear and keep arms . 
  i did n't always think that . 
  i thought firearms were barbaric and only ignorant , dumb americans could want to own them . 
  then i read about them , learned the statistics , accepted a few common sense realities , and realised what a firearm really is , and now i could n't imagine myself without one . 
  yeah , i do n't think i 'll ever be in danger of a home invader . 
  but in the case of a home invasion , i 'll be just fine , and the added utility of using it competitions i think makes for a great hobby , and in the very worst case scenarios i can use it for hunting . 
  i honestly think a good rifle is man 's best friend in most dangerous situations . 
  actually roma is considered offensive and the proper term is romani , you filthy racist scumbag . 
  i 'd rather have a gun on me than nothing at all so that people do n't think about robbing me in the first place . 
  there 's a ** massive ** paranoia of immigrants , especially muslims , in mainland europe and the uk . 
  other than that it 's all solid . 
  you 're saying you do n't know any pro-british person that feels that they were bullied into it . 
  and you 're saying that you do n't know any irish person that would give it up . 
  well , i doubt any pro-russian in crimea would say they were bullied into the federation . 
  northern ireland was , in my opinion , the crimea of the 1920 's . 
  while the irish revolution was in full swing ( the british had promised up home rule if we fought for them in wwi then did n't follow through ) , they passed the ** government of ireland act 1920 ** which gave the north-east of ireland - the six counties now known as northern ireland - self-government within the united kingdom . 
  and when the revolution was done , the revolutionaries did n't have the majority in the north anymore because of the partition . 
  if you were to take ireland as a whole , the north and the republic , you would fine a population of about 15 % in * favour * of union with the british . 
  however , if you cut that up into north and south , you 'll find the north has a majority pro-british , and it is * that * region the british focused on getting , not the south . 
  what i 'm saying is that russia will not care about what the whole of estonia thinks . 
  they will take whatever region has the pro-russian majority in it and disregard the rest of the country . 
  and yet here we are with a partitioned island and a minority pro-british population . 
  if you take into account the whole island pro-british is ~ 15 % but had a majority in the region that is now northern ireland , and it would be the same with any region russia would chew off . 
  it 's a complex , you know , going from being the whole poster boy of the union to an embarrassment everybody wants to forget . 
  i was kind of surprised at the czech republic 's result .
