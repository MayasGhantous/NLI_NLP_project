  not because it was being asked ( ireland has a long history of conflict with israel , or we did until we got a jewish minister for defense , now we 're `` a friend of israel '' ) , but that the czechs are indeed pro-israel . 
  france would preemptively surrender to russia . 
  the mid-1900s kind ? 
  the commission works with what it has . 
  ultimately all it can really do is talk to member states and tell them to do stuff , and after that it 's out of their hands . 
  absolutely , we have a barrier to entry for a reason . 
  if moldova wants into the eu so bad , make those reforms and make them quick , and then they stand a serious chance . 
  the union does n't like promising join dates . 
  it 's more of `` you 'll get there when you get there '' kind of deal . 
  so philosophical such edge much retard, 
  turkey has wanted that to change for a lonnnng time . 
  might be now they chance it . 
  it 's funny that some of those searches are clearly for a different thing lol , like georgia and turkey - and how montenegro does n't even * have * a `` why is '' search result . 
  and i just realized i forgot moldova . 
  it 's `` why is moldova so poor ? '', 
  poland can into intelligent questions ? 
  well what 's nato gon na do ? 
  invade russia over a supposed connection to alleged terrorist attacks ? 
  believe me , a small country like estonia ... 
  if you create a big enough problem , bully them enough without actually attacking them , they might well give up the territory for free . 
  he 's saying that that 's what svoboda thinks in order to disassociate russians from slavs , thus making ukrainians the true `` slavic people '' i suppose . 
  i hold great concern for europeans within the russian federation . 
  it 's not like russia ca n't do things other than invade . 
  fund separatists/extremists ? 
  infiltrate with russians ? 
  they have special forces geared towards terror tactics . 
  what military reasons does the us want kosovo for ? 
  it has military bases in almost every country in europe , i struggle to find what major advantage kosovo would bring it . 
  and given what had just happened in bosnia , it 's not even a stretch to believe genocide was a possibility if not in effect already . 
  and if * any * violence was occurring in kosovo , it still makes it wildly different to crimea where no blood had been spilled until yesterday - by * russia/crimea * , which would be the equivalent of kosovoars/nato killing serbs , if we 're so determined to make direct comparisons . 
  one was on the backdrop of genocide , the other was not . 
  not to mention [ this is what happens in a conscript army ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=342_1376864182&amp;comments=1 ), 
  because they still think it 'll be like the winter war mkii . 
  ukraine is n't constantly fighting in wars/insurgencies . 
  russian military is much more dangerous to be in . 
  not to mention ukrainian conscription 's been over for a while now . 
  the answer to two of my questions is [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20q04q/i_am_member_of_the_european_parliament_margrete/cg6eue6 ), 
  the answer to two of my questions is [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20q04q/i_am_member_of_the_european_parliament_margrete/cg6eue6 ), 
  you 'd be surprised man , a lot of retards in the west gobble up that shit just because they look for any reason to be contrary to america . 
  so that they can untie it whenever they feel like it . 
  if the euro were to collapse , the danes still control the krone and can tough it out much better . 
  does that have any realistic basis or are they just looking for someone to blame ? 
  they 'll be asked to leave their land and compensated with premium real estate in siberia . 
  no no no , they 're crimean self-defense forces !, 
  you 're excused . 
  well it does n't get much more de-escalated than radioactive ash !, 
  lower case m is quite often used when referring to currency . 
  hey margrete and welcome to / r/europe !, 
  thanks for taking the time out to answer some questions . 
  ** firstly ** , assuming you 're in favour of a sovreign palestinian state , how would * you * solve the current impasse between israel and palestine ? 
  the traditional two-state solution adhering to the old 1967 borders as of palestine as laid out in unsc resolution 242 ? 
  or do you not believe that realistic at this point ? 
  ** secondly ** , as a member of the green party , how do you feel about nuclear power and do you see it as an suitable intermediate power source while transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy ? 
  ** thirdly ** , as mep , what are your feelings towards further european integration within the european union ? 
  as in , the shifting of more power to the european parliament and other legislative bodies of the union , as well as a possibility of formation of a single unified european military ( a step up from our current battlegroups and eufor task forces ) . 
  ** fourthly ** , on that note , what reforms ( if any ) would you make to the process of creating and passing legislation and applying it to eu member states ? 
  ** fifth ** , what was your most unexpected experience as member of parliament ( both in denmark and brussels ) . 
  what surprised you the most ? 
  ** lastly ** , what has been your favourite place to visit in europe , and why ? 
  edit : and while i 'm thinking about it !, 
  what do you think about energy dependence on russian gas exports amongst various countries within the european union ? 
  yes , then you talk about the uk . 
  the european union as a whole has quite little in terms of trade with russia . 
  we 're russia 's biggest trading partner , they 're not even 10 % of ours . 
  i would n't doubt their resolve . 
  turkey is quite protective of tatars . 
  it was very much a great leap of faith on both sides to keep it secret . 
  geopolitics seems to be the layman 's term for political machiavellian scheming in relation to foreign policy . 
  the fight over crimea is a good example of geopolitics , because it 's a strategic location . 
  the strait of bosphorus is also a good example . 
  in the midst of that rant , all i can say is `` lol '' trying to equate russian media with western media ? 
  how much koolaide have you chugged down lately ? 
  and , no , turkey is n't getting as much coverage . 
  no fucking shit . 
  turkey is n't an international crisis . 
  turkey is n't verging on war . 
  turkey is n't occupation and annexation . 
  we do n't rely on trade with russia at all , and russia will never turn off the gas unless it 's an outright war situation . 
  you 've been spamming this subreddit with pro-russian ( or more accurately , rabidly anti-west ) drivel since you created your account a grand total of 1 day ago . 
  please fuck off . 
  so i 'm assuming this will be a new post , i 've quite a few question !, 
  thanks for setting this up guys , hopefully it gets deserved attention . 
  [ message received ] ( http://img.pandawhale.com/100259-dat-joe-biden-face-gif-state-o-ndqs.gif ), 
  it would be expensive and ** time consuming ** . 
  in order to get a proper network of pipes established , it could take russia years ( especially if we want to make it * really * hard for them by having a little chat with a few countries ) , in which time europe could achieve energy independence . 
  hitler always had this moronic idea that bigger was better . 
  it was only ever used once because the logistics were too ridiculous . 
  fuck the ira . 
  they 're the disgraceful dregs of what once used to be a proud organization with tangible goals . 
  they 're glorified drug dealers themselves . 
  fuck the northern dissidents , for that matter , they have no public mandate for their violence . 
  i do n't want to have closer ties with another regime of tyranny and human rights abuses . 
  sadly , morality is lost on politics . 
  the spoiler effect . 
  lib dems got 3rd last elections , coalitioned with the tories , did n't do everything they promised , and back to strategic voting it is . 
  fptp at its best . 
  the same state that forcibly takes your money every time you get a paycheck . 
  your duties to the state are what the state decides what it appropriate . 
  i think mandatory * training * is great imo , mandatory enlistment not so much . 
  being forced to fight in a war you do n't agree with is fundamentally wrong - something a slave would be doing .
