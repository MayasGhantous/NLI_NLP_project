  there was an influx of troops and there are russians all over crimea that have seized strategic points and ousted the local government . 
  it absolutely , categorically , undeniably , is an ** invasion ** . 
   it 's the law a law of discrimination . 
  you do n't seem to realize laws can be bad things . 
  dae think god is stupid ? 
  if there were latin people still there and they wanted independence you might have a mildly equatable situation . 
  this article comes from a standpoint that views prisons in a fundamentally damaging and absolutely idiotic manner . 
  as a centre of punishment and not of rehabilitation . 
  the conditions in a prison * should * be good . 
  the best way to make someone your worst enemy is by kicking them while they 're down . 
  they 've had a terrible life which has lead to them breaking the law , and then they get this horrible news that they 're being sent to prison . 
  now , when they get there do we doubly reinforce that feeling of depression and unhappiness , or do we make them a bit more comfortable , try to get them better and gear them towards rehabilitation so that when they get out , they 'll have a better perspective and never do something like that again ? 
  if people leave prison feeling that they 're improved themselves and that things are n't all bad , they wont fuck up and put themselves back in there . 
  if people leave prison feeling that society has betrayed them in their time of need and that they have absolutely nothing waiting for them , they wont give a fuck . 
  what is unfortunate in this circumstance is that you 'll always have a piece of shit willing to abuse the system . 
  that 's just the way it is . 
  if there 's something good being done for someone , a bad person will abuse it to their advantage . 
  how would sweden joining nato benefit the alliance anyways ? 
  all they 've been doing over the past decade is military downsizing . 
  it 's absolutely true that after the ussr the us treated the russians like losers . 
  and that was wrong . 
  regardless , even if they still treated them like shit , russia is still categorically `` the bully '' . 
  and so is the us . 
  and china . 
  and probably the eu , too , while we 're at it . 
  the difference here is that russia is invading a neighbouring country over fabricated claims with no basis in reality . 
  that 's it . 
  that . 
  nothing more . 
  nothing less . 
  that is the simple fact . 
  no more discussion need be had . 
  done . 
  has it been done by others in the past ? 
  yes . 
  and that was wrong , too . 
  but it 's already been done and can not be changed . 
  this is * still * being done and * can * be changed . 
  unless there was ethnic cleansing or genocide , russia has no legitimate cause for intervention . 
  absolutely none . 
  their past claims ? 
  entirely irrelevant . 
  the size of the russian population ? 
  entirely irrelevant . 
  russia 's political interest ? 
  entirely ** irrelevant ** . 
  russia 's butthurt over american diplomatic incompetency is the least important thing there is right now . 
  and i have no sympathy for them . 
  i wish my people were n't so fucking stupid sometimes . 
  it 's not appeasement if you 're the aggressor . 
  because people are n't made of money ? 
  and because they have to move because of your arbitrary discrimination ? 
  russia does n't give a fuck about the domestic politics of ukraine . 
  every fascist in the country could be killed and put 6ft into the ground and ukraine would still be run by fascists as far as russian warmongering needs to be concerned . 
  then they 'll take finland and that 'll be that . 
  make no mistake , this will not be a repeat of the winter war . 
  egypt is pretty fucking close as well . 
  the other side of the mediterranean a ` int that far . 
  dat crimea flag accompanied by statements of a clearly brainwashed person . 
  account 3 days old ? 
  bullshit checks out . 
  i really need to get a handbook to all the political processes of the eu . 
  i expect it would be bigger and more boring than the bible, 
  there has never been an attack on a nato member , period . 
  it 's entirely untested , which is good and bad . 
  good because it means nobody wants to fuck with nato , and bad because nobody knows what would actually happen . 
  we really need to fix that and then add another house that represents the interests of nation states . 
  it 's not a factor of eu competency , it 's a factor of eu 's internal squabbling . 
  it can not act with strength because by doing so members would claim infringement on their sovreignty - and we all know there are certain people who would use that to gain momentum in an anti-eu movement ( * coughukipcough * ) . 
  the fact of the matter is that domestic politics and internal disunity has rendered the eu powerless to act anywhere * outside of the eu * . 
  while i agree with you in principal , it 's the budapest ** memorandum ** . 
  it 's a paper shield and one ukraine should n't have taken as a guarantee of protection , the wording is far too vague . 
  furthermore , it guarantees they will respect the territorial integrity of ukraine , * not * defend it . 
  we should be leading the charge in europe while the us takes care of the pacific . 
  i 've never had a lower opinion of the eu as an institution then i have now . 
  proxy war . 
  people are stupid if they think the us ( and probably eu memberstates ) are n't organizing under the table deals to hand over equipment , money and intelligence . 
  not to mention many countries have the power to effect a war directly with small units while keeping their hand in the matter concealed . 
  i believe in distinct racial differences , but dear god i lol 'd at the idiocy . 
  i 'm irish but i 'm also an egyptian national . 
  how does that work in your world ? 
  race = / = nationality . 
  your nationality is where you hold citizenship in , your race is decided by the gene pool you inherit the most traits from ( to dumb it down ) . 
  because we do that all the time . 
  why not ? 
  i 'm willing to bet it was russian provocateurs, 
  being between the two would imply that either obama or thatcher was worse than putin . 
  now thatcher 's a fucking piece of shit , but what made her so bad was that she was very anti-working class and shit all over everybody who was n't well off . 
  do n't tell me putin is * better * than her in that regard , the same man who stays in power through stealing public money and funneling it to mega-wealthy oligarchs . 
  then there 's obama , who 's just been a gigantic disappointment as opposed to a force of evil . 
  he 's two faced , he lies , and he 's responsible for the expansion of drone-based warfare - but in reality anybody in his position is going to invest heavily in unmanned combat . 
  under obama the americans have pulled out of iraq and afghanistan , or are in the process of pulling out depending on how you see it , and obama has also been pretty diplomatic in terms of foreign policy - i do n't think i was the only one who supported intervention in syria when the revolution first started there , before it became a dirty civil war . 
  i do n't think you can really pin obama as evil . 
  incompetent and weak ? 
  possibly . 
  putin does n't care about domestic economy . 
  he lines his pockets either way . 
  he cares about creating a foreign distraction so people at home do n't know/notice their economic struggles , or just simply put it down to their enemies oppressing them . 
  remember post 9/11 america , where if you spoke out against the military in the wrong neighbourhood there was a high chance of something bad happening to you ? 
  well , put that against a backdrop of economic collapse .
