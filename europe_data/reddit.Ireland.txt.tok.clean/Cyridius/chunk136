  makes me wonder why the tax payer is subsidizing those bastards in the first place . 
  the day israel enters the eu is the day i call for ireland to leave . 
  if the veto still exists if that day ever comes i 'm sure the irish people would encourage its use . 
  corruption is what made ireland such an economic catastrophe . 
  anglo-irish bank alone crippled our economy by crippling the banking sector and is what forced the imf and ecb to bail us out in the first place . 
  right now ireland is 193bn in debt ( which is 117 % of our gdp ) . 
  anglo irish bank directly cost us 30bn , and as a result of its dealings causing a widespread banking crash , there was an additional 100bn on top of that to bailout the banking sector . 
  so 130bn of ireland 's current 193bn debt can be traced back to anglo-irish bank . 
  any why did we bail them out ? 
  well , let 's say people in high places help out their friends . 
  at least now that we have a different government in power , fitzpatrick and his cronies are being brought to justice and i hope that bastard gets locked up for the maximum 60 year sentence and lives out the rest of his life in jail . 
  however , former taoiseach bertie ahern still needs to fully answer for his crimes of corruption , and the maple 10 ( 10 people who fitzpatrick gave anglo-irish loans to so they could in turn by shares in anglo-irish bank and drive up the share prices ) need to be brought to court for fraud . 
  while we 've managed to kill big time corruption with this government , an attitude of excessive discretionary expenditure by politicians using tax payer money still exists , hundreds of thousands have been claimed on extortionate holidays , alcohol , transport , hotels , the works . 
  and to add onto that , the health service executive is a bloated bureaucratic mess which is draining the country 's health service , where funds could go to much more important places like the front line staff who have much more strain on them to the point they 're verging on breaking , and i 'm more than sure there 's been piles of corruption going on in the backroom meetings with hse for a number of years now , with all those `` administrators '' walking away with hefty bonuses . 
  and to add even further that an garda s\u00edoch\u00e1na ( police ) have had a major whistleblow recently on large amounts of corruption in road traffic policing , waiving penalty points by the dozen , not to mention i know of several corrupt garda\u00ed myself who have on more than few occasions not enforced the law because they knew this person or that person . 
  ah , thanks for explaining . 
  so basically what he 's saying is that there 's no need for a commissioner from every country ? 
   i would consider lessening the geographic restrictions on commission membership . 
  this might take time , but think about your national government . 
  nobody in ireland , for example , would call for the government to be composed of one member from each of the 26 counties . 
  i do n't understand what you mean . 
  can you explain further ? 
  i would compress the bureaucracy to streamline the decision making process ( for eg . 
  abolish european council ) . 
  i would make joining the eurozone a mandatory condition of membership , with people only attaining membership of the union when they are economically capable of being a member of the eurozone expansion of eufor capabilities and standardization of forces across memberstates simplify the clauses for the union and force uniform conditions across member states without exceptions . 
  for example , all french territories should be an official part of the european union regardless of their geographical position . 
  accept mediterranean countries so long as they meet all the requirements of membership put more pressure on bordering nations to work towards joining the union, 
  ** ireland ** that bastard sean fitzpatrick is finally being brought to court for inflating the stock prices of anglo-irish bank , which lead to the bank 's collapse and as a result the collapse of the irish banking sector , leaving ireland with 130bn of debt ( for perspective ; we 're currently 193bn in debt and that 's 117 % of our gdp ) .

  `` our grey and damp countryside is now being used to reduce our carbon footprint and bring in revenue to the country . 
  fuck that '' hopefully these people are all ignored . 
  cripplingly inefficient bureaucracy 2 . 
  a politics lacking in true ideology 3 . 
  poor infrastructure outside the capitol ( it 's great in the capitol though , and 25 % of our pop lives there so meh ) 4 . 
  political inaction on major issues 5 . 
  cost of living in relation to wages and taxes 6 . 
  youth unemployment 7 . 
  brain drain - everybody is emigrating to canada , australia and the us ( and i plan on joining them ) 8 . 
  lack of certain personal freedoms 9 . 
  us islands must be different , you see . 
  unfortunately , no , our stance on neutrality is prohibitive to modernization . 
  in terms of manpower , we 're not really lacking when you consider our population ( we have a standing army of ~ 10k , which is more than lithuania , slovenia , and only slightly less than sweden - keep in mind this was 5 years ago , so it might be less now ) , but our hardware has always been outdated surplus from western europe , with only 14 `` mbts '' and a negligible navy , most of our military `` might '' is infantry , and the arw are very much on par with their foreign equivalents . 
  almost all our hardware if from the 70 's - our `` main battle tanks '' are actually scorpions which are light recce vehicles ... 
  after the belgians granted the congo independence , katanga - the congo 's wealthiest region , broke off with belgian and corporate backing . 
  to prevent the soviets from intervening , the un sent a mission there of which the irish were a major part . 
  the un 's mandate was to * enforce * peace , so they essentially went to war with katanga . 
  th irish were digging in a belgian mining town called jadotville when a botched un operation in elizabethville caused open hostilities between both sides . 
  the white settlers of jadotville , as well as belgian paratroopers , ex-french foreign legion mercenaries , and katangan soldiers , attacked the irish ( whom were sent there to protect the white settlers - ironic ) . 
  the irish held off against this attack ( 5,000 men vs. 150 ) for 5 days and then surrendered when they ran out of ammunition and water . 
  the irish were heavily involved in almost every military operation in katanga at the time . 
  capitalist investment into telecommunications infrastructure came into those regions much later than into western ones . 
  scandinavia already had this and it failed miserably because it was proven to be a load of bullshit and pseudo-science . 
  but we still need to worry about russia . 
  they can bully us if we do n't have a strong defense , and right now they 're very close to doing that . 
  without our own strong , independent military , we 're nothing more than lackeys to american interests . 
  eastern europe/soviet bloc countries were all late to the game , so they have far more advanced infrastructure . 
   because they have about 2 a ~ ~ week ~ ~ ** day ** . 
  we care . 
  but as we see it , it 's all in the past . 
  it 's done . 
  both us and the british are different now . 
  the european union has played a significant role in patching things up . 
  fair enough . 
  if you guys ever want to watch a good movie on the whole independence movement from 1916 until 1922 , * michael collins * is an ** amazing ** film , you should be able to watch the entire thing on youtube by now , it 's been out for nearly 2 decades ( and still maintains its quality , it 's aged quite well ) . 
  we 've moved on . 
  everyone that fought those battles is dead now . 
  smuggled and failed . 
  it was captured by the british . 
  sea . 
  i do see your point though . 
  eire is the name . 
  get over it . 
  edit ; i 'm wrong, 
  it is n't a myth . 
  if you read newspapers at the time and witness accounts as well as popular reaction , it was not supported by the public . 
  we didnt want independence , we wanted home rule , as was agreed by the british to be given to us by 1914 . 
  after the martyrdom of the rising 's leaders , only then did the republican movement gain momentum . 
  padraig pearse knew that when he organized the rising , naming it a `` blood sacrifice '' . 
  even they knew their movement was n't popular - the largest irish force left on the island ( national volunteers ) would n't even help them despite being nationalist . 
  i 'm going to have to disagree here the only way to end the violence was to have both sides sit down and agree to stop . 
  locking the leaders up would just have created a power vacuum and increased violence . 
  i have very mixed feelings on the subject myself . 
  i understand where both sides of the conversation come from - i 've switched between both camps enough times to know . 
  but the conversation of abortion is just a much more emotionally charged one than any other , and both sides are pretty much not reconcilable because both views are fundamentally different to their core . 
  hopefully most of them step on an ied and stay over there forever . 
  i remember they said he was almost certainly going to die , too . 
  i wonder how different the world would have been if that worked out . 
  they 're pretty much already done that . 
  anarchists in a nutshell . 
  do it slowly , in steps , but make those steps large and significant . 
  yes but we 're part of the eurozone .
