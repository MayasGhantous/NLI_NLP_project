  punderful . 
   first of all , it 's not strictly true . 
  the euro 's popularity has fallen sharply among crisis-hit countries . 
  but even so , it tells me that either they 're idiots and do n't see the connection or that they 're afraid of the repercussions that an exit from the monetary union would entail . 
  or , like me , like the concept of a monetary union and hope for stricter regulations in the future to prevent this happening . 
  people who like free speech ? 
  oversight is still oversight . 
  they can ignore it until it gets changed somewhere down the line . 
  because the british army was a primarily impartial peacekeeping force who are only responsible for 10 % of the deaths in the entire conflict , almost all of which were militant . 
  as of 1969 , the british army 's deployment was an * immediate * result of the battle of the bogside and a seen need to protect roman catholic populations , primarily in derry and parts of belfast . 
  the other reasons the army was deployed were due to the insufficient numbers of ruc to enforce law and order , and fear of an ira uprising in belfast . 
  while the british army hardly has a spotless record in the north , both in handling nationalists and unionists , they were deployed as an impartial force in response to the spiral of chaos that the north was descending into . 
  it 's absolutely true the british army was an ineffective animal when it came to true protection of the nationalist population , but to compare a * uniformed * security force there to enforce law and order and prevent governmental collapse with a paramilitary organization is audacity . 
  these were never going to go anywhere . 
  all of the political parties in the north make their living by pandering to their demographics . 
  sinn f\u00e9in can not ease up on some of their stupid claims ( like throwing in the british army with the ira and uvf ) without pissing off their voters , the sdlp ca n't take a stance against some of sinn f\u00e9in 's stupid claims because they 're nationalists and have to be `` unified '' , and the unionist parties ca n't look to capitulate to a version of history that makes them look as equally culpable as the republicans without them looking like shit . 
  the unionist parties have staying power because they look after loyalists and unionists . 
  which means they ca n't shit all over them and expect to keep their seats next election . 
  definitely . 
  my father 's sunni , my mom 's catholic and i 'm atheist . 
  the ideological differences between sunni and shitte ( and other denominations ) are as broad , and often much broader , than the differences between catholic and protestant . 
  muslims are a rapidly growing community in ireland , though , mostly due to educated arabs immigrating to work in the health sector and science/engineering . 
  with that said , there 's still a negligible amount of them here ( 49,000 according to the article , which is correct from when i last saw the statistics ) . 
  actually , `` baile \u00c1tha cliath '' ( dublin ) = bridge over the ford or town of the hurdled ford i know `` blackpool '' is derived from dubhlinn but i 've never actually heard dubhlinn be used , it 's always been baile \u00c1tha cliath . 
  anyways , there seems to be quite a few mistakes in this map , looks like it was compiled by someone with no local knowledge . 
   is it just domestic v. foreign ? 
  in a nutshell . 
  canada has a similar idea ; a set amount of radio airtime has to be dedicated to canadian artists . 
  the overall goal is to promote domestic culture as opposed to external culture influences ; for example i reckon ( though i 'm not an expert in the field or in on their policy making so this is conjecture ) that if a french band was playing russian music or something then they would n't benefit from cultural subsidies ( or whatever it is the government actually does with money from the tax ) . 
  i 'm honestly confused at what this opinion piece is trying to say . 
  the `` big wigs '' at anglo need to be taken to the cleaners and locked up . 
  most of this bloody mess is them , they *** lied *** to us , our government , our regulators , and our government is complicit in their fraud . 
  pure corruption and this is why we need radical changes in our governmental infrastructure and bureaucracy . 
  this is a stupidly common misconception . 
  the irish government did not take out these loans . 
  banks did . 
  the bondholders . 
  the government bailed out these people , these private entities , with taxpayer money . 
  by burning bondholders they mean not paying off their debt for them . 
  it 's not ireland hono ** u ** ring it 's debts , it 's ireland paying off somebody else 's debts . 
  poles are always good value for money , but a poor long term investment . 
  i actually missed that and it 's hilarious now that i see it . 
  germany is all the worst things ( lest trustworthy , most arrogant , lest compassionate ) and greece is all the good things . 
  i think we might have a contender for most arrogant ... 
  i 'm surprised ireland 's never mentioned as compassionate , even though we 're the highest per capita charity donors in europe and like 3rd on the planet . 
  we were n't currently shitting on the brits . 
  though i suppose as an irishman , every time is `` shit on britain '' time . 
  thanks for clarification, 
  would n't be the first or last time the french got their hands dirty in the region . 
  they were israel 's chief arms supplier and helped them achieve nuclear capability , before they got supplanted by the us . 
  not to mention the coordinated invasion of egypt with israel . 
  what do you expect , it 's russia . 
  i know it 's ironic , me saying that in context to what i 'm replying to ( making a broad-stroke comment ) , but let 's not pretend that russians are n't xenophobic and let 's not pretend that they do n't shit all over muslims on the regular basis . 
  they 're also extremely tolerant towards gays , amirite ? 
  innocence is subjective . 
  by being a tax paying citizen you are supporting your government in whatever it is doing . 
  period . 
  collateral damage is shitty . 
  it 's terrible that children get harmed and killed . 
  that 's the worst thing to ever happen in an act of violence like this . 
  but every movement is a terror organization when it starts and there 's always civilian targets at some point or another . 
  mandela 's acts of terror were bombing civilians and school buses full of white children , and he 's hailed as a man of peace . 
  michael collins , the irish revolutionary , put hits out on civilians all the time , and he 's loved by us . 
  castro rounded up and imprisoned or killed all those who opposed his socialist/communist ideals , and there are people all over the world who support him , let alone the cubans . 
  and that 's just getting started . 
  the old adage applies here ; one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter . 
  russian imperialism is the root cause of these terror attacks . 
  the first & second chechnyan wars , the subsequent oppression of nationalist movements in the caucasus regions has lead to the rise of islamist radicalism in chechnya , dagestan , and so on . 
  the involvement in syria does not held either , especially when you 're facing people with the financial means of the saudi princes , who can fund terror attacks forever . 
  i know that if ireland today was still under the rule of england , that we were denied our right to self determination , that the english people were supporting their government and what they were doing , that we were oppressed and denied our freedom , i would pull the trigger myself . 
  some people are willing to kill for their ideals , some are even willing to die for them , and while they 're not right , they 're not * wrong * either , and we ca n't judge right from wrong , from the outside because we ca n't possibly share their perspective or their experiences . 
  i 've always made my opinion clear when it comes to independence movements ; every people has a * right * to self determination . 
  i see the right to one 's own country as a basic human right that is denied to too many all over the world . 
  while terrorism is never the first option before peaceful and political negotiation , it should never be ruled out as `` evil '' or `` wrong '' when all else fails . 
  and all else * has * failed in russia . 
  if we ruled out every resistance movement as `` evil '' or `` terrorism '' or `` wrong '' , then you can say goodbye to the irish republican army in the war of independence , which was labelled by the british government as terrorists , you can say goodbye to the french resistance in world war ii , you can say goodbye to the united states of america , you can say goodbye to poland , and pretty much most of eastern europe , let 's not forget the baltic states , either . 
  or the scandinavian ones for that matter . 
  you can say goodbye to pakistan and india and bangladesh . 
  it 's endless . 
  so , yes , it 's a horrible thing that people are being killed here , but let 's not pretend the russians are on the righteous side of good , or that we have an enlightened view of the conflict , or that the terrorists are good or bad guys , hell , despite my big response , i wont even pretend that i know i 'm right . 
  i 'm just a guy with an opinion . 
  we do n't * know * who 's doing these attacks and more importantly we do n't know * why * . 
  so , despite what 's been said , let 's not be stupidly emotional and sentimental and try to approach this violence from a more pragmatic or logical point of view before me make judgements . 
  could be a variety . 
  i doubt non-muslim non-tatar russian citizens would be involved , but to many the caucasus is as much russia as russia itself , and would count those living there as russian . 
  given how separatist movements in russia have taken a turn towards islamic radicalism , i reckon russian converts would be much more inclined to join a terror organization . 
  but that 's just an outside view . 
  ok , * subject * . 
  now pick up that can . 
  we 'd stay in . 
  the eu has done too much for us ( while simultaneously fucking us in the ass , but hey beggars ca n't be choosers ) and we 're too small to want to opt out . 
  not surprised . 
  yeah , we might finally agree on whether or not it 's ok to wave a flag or not . 
  stupid violence over outdated politics . 
  definitely does n't need them . 
  russia 's a land based entity more than anything , and the soviets only accepted to kinds of neighbours ; vassals or enemies . 
  very land based army . 
  would only have needed them defensively or to power project in the pacific , but the pacific was never their thing and killing carriers is n't as hard as it used to be . 
  we will be neither with or against the germans , but secretly we 'll be britain 's bitch . 
  i wish we all kept the irish language alive .
