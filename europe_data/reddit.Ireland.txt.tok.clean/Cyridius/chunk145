  this is what this entire crisis is about , ignoring matters of political principle in that the entire basis of the european project is at stake , economically a greece default has a potential to be a massive disaster for every other country in the eurozone and if anything will hasten its breaking up , with countries like spain , portugal , ireland and even italy realising that the concept of `` european solidarity '' is nonexistent and following suit . 
  you realise he has hundreds of billions in european debt to play with , right ? 
  default , exit the euro , crash europe 's economy . 
  the arrogance here is that the troika has repeatedly rejected perfectly good and workable deals that meet all their demands . 
   can you actually point out a single proposal that syriza 's government presented to the troika that you personally believe no one would ever reject pretty much all of them . 
  is is absolute madness that the troika has rejected the deals offered by syriza thus far , and even right wing economists would not think otherwise . 
  this is an entirely politically motivated assault on the european left . 
  i do n't think that 's fair to french people . 
  russia has 4 armies for its separate sectors . 
  what 's on the border with ukraine and nearby east europe is only a single section of the russian armed forces . 
  they have others operating elsewhere with more than enough manpower for each front . 
   a bit too simplistic , and a bit too disingenuous . 
  a bit simplistic , absolutely not disingenuous . 
  the rest of europe seems to be happy patting itself on the back for `` saving '' ireland in its time of need , but the reality is europe put a gun to our head and forced us into our course of action , a course of action which put ** 42 % ** of europe 's banking debt on a population responsible for ** 11 % ** of it . 
  that is 1 % of europe 's population is paying for 42 % of europe 's banking debt ; extortion and robbery at best . 
  and where did all of this bailout money go ? 
  not into the irish economy , just as it has n't went into the greek economy . 
  it 's gone purely into the hands of speculators and gamblers , the loss was socialised and the profit was privatised . 
  before the present blackmailing of greece i held some hopes of the european leaders coming to their senses , but it 's quite clear now that profits come before people and the european project is subordinate to the profiteering of capitalists and subordination of debt colonies - and the governments of portugal , italy , ireland and spain are in no small way part of the present problem , acting as colonial overseers , immune to democratic will under the mantra of `` there is no alternative '' to the `` medicine '' of austerity and the dictatorships of the markets manifesting themselves politically through the troika institutions . 
  `` oh shit , someone 's caught me being a fucking dickhead , better tell them to calm down and pretend they 're annoyed over some trivial thing ! '', 
  hey , smartass , what there in any way , shape or form is in contradiction with any single fucking thing i 've said ? 
  before being a condescending piece of shit at least read what you 're responding to comprehensively and try to fucking understand it . 
  prick . 
  what it says in the title . 
  that 's the border crossing between turkey and syria - on the syrian end the territory is controlled by isis . 
  at the time this picture was taken , the refugees from a nearby town which is about to be a battle site between the ypg and isis are trying to cross over . 
  the turkish border was initially closed on the turkish end - after a few days the border was opened , and then isis closed it from their end . 
  this is where you see them herding people back towards the town they fled from ( presumably to use as human shields , though this is only speculation ) . 
  as turkey is neutral , they of course did not intervene in what was happening on the other side of the border . 
  the borders have since then open and closed a few times depending on isis 's mood , on the turkish end it is now generally open . 
   people flee to europe : / r/europe says to repel them . 
  not me !, 
  why are turkish nationalists so weird ? 
   exactly . 
  why should turks try to help the pkk ? 
  do you guys realize that the pkk is responsible for 40,000 deaths in turkey ? 
  it seems like it 's a bit of a joke for you guys . 
  it 's like asking the us to help al qaeda because `` isis is worse than them '' . 
  they 're both terrorists . 
  yeah , because i 'm sure the pkk lined up all those 40,000 people and put a bullet in each and every one of them . 
  the turkish army in its 30 years of counter-insurgency never once killed a single human being . 
  pkk are n't `` nice guys '' anymore than turkish kurdistan 's military dictatorship and its backers were . 
  i do n't expect turkish nationalists to have a balanced view of the subject anymore than i expect a kurdish nationalist to , though . 
   by the way turkey took in 200,000 kurdish civilians from kobane to save them from the conflict not including the 2 million syrian civilians it took in . 
  where 's the god damn appreciation ? 
  `` no turks you go and get killed fighting the isis barbarians and we 'll watch you from home . '', 
  thanks for taking war refugees from a city that was less than a kilometre from your border , i guess ? 
  do n't get me wrong , the refugee efforts of the neighbouring countries in syria are admirable . 
   if europeans are really that worried they can take the 2 million syrians off turkey 's hands since they 're not offering any sufficient humanitarian aid i would be perfectly happy with europe taking more war refugees from syria . 
  considering the millions of them that exist we 've taken very few , only in the tens of thousands on a non-humanitarian basis . 
  it 's not like i 'm advocating europe not help people while shitting on turkey for not helping people enough . 
  those people may exist but i 'm not one of them . 
  it 's not so much as `` supporting '' as it is `` tolerating '' . 
  right now isis is fighting the pkk and ypg - these organisations have been fighting the turkish governments for decades ( either directly or indirectly ) over kurdish autonomy and rights in turkey ( or straight up independence ) - to the point that up until a few years ago turkish kurdistan was ruled by what was effectively a military dictatorship . 
  ypg 's success in fighting in syria , due to its affiliation with the pkk , is in the long term a bad thing ( as far as turkish authorities are concerned ) . 
  best outcome for turkish authorities then is isis and kurds to wear eachother down . 
  of course a lot of turkish people are very opposed to this strategy but alas unless there 's a big shift in government in turkey this wont change ( and even then , depends on how the turkish military acts ) . 
  with hdp 's success last election there might be a change in approach , though i do n't think this is likely . 
  it 's a very iffy thing . 
  the crossing is between isis controlled territory and turkey ; isis has closed it and opened it on a whim . 
  stay around long enough i might fill my mind with a bullet from one of those weddings . 
  celebratory gunfire for anything is probably one of the stupidest things i 've ever heard about . 
  ca n't miss what you do n't remember , but i have no attachment to the euro . 
  whichever is economically more sound at the time in question is what i support . 
  i 'd agree with you if there were n't so many economic benefits to getting married in most places . 
  in ireland for example there were , what , ~ 260 differences between a civil union and a marriage , let alone between nothing and marriage . 
  under the current system , marriage has material benefits . 
  expecting people not to avail of them is pretty ridiculous imo as for the abolishing of marriage ; it wont happen . 
  marriage is a contingent part of property rights - inheritance and all that kind of stuff . 
  until private property relations are n't really a thing , like under socialism or communism , then marriage will necessarily be maintained . 
  the usa is going through the same austerity programs as here . 
  cutting to education , welfare , services etc. 
  is all ongoing , just at state and municipal levels . 
  granted , there was n't all that much to cut to start within the us , but it 's not for lack of trying . 
  austerity is a very backwards view to take if you want to save things ( even varoufakis ' stated view was to save european capitalism from itself ) but capital thinks mostly in terms of short term profits and maximisation of profit , so the general population 's reaction to things does n't come into it . 
  for capitalists the crisis has been great , billions have been taken from the general population and transferred to them , only possible through austerity . 
  so while austerity is in the long term a very bad idea , especially now that it has radicalised a lot of people in a very anti-capitalist way , in made people richer which is ultimately what matters as far as they 're concerned . 
  austerity is beyond europe and results from the crisis of capitalism and the markets currently ongoing . 
  just see what happens when you have a party that tries to implement keynesian reforms like syriza in greece , or a country which tries to have an independent economic policy like venezuela . 
  both get viciously attacked by other states in the interest of capital . 
  they have done and always will . 
  the odds are that halal food was prepared in a perfectly humane manner ( as humane as killing animals gets ) . 
  in western nations the standard practice is to stun the animal prior to killing anyways . 
  there 's no real reason to oppose any law banning the other method of ritual slaughter . 
  yeah , i prefer slaughtering dead animals . 
  lol no it is n't . 
  it * can * do , but the modern standard practice is to stun it beforehand so it feels no pain . 
  of course , some , many , do not follow this rule for convenience purposes but in any western nation this is how it will be prepared . 
  halal meat is haram ? 
  * head explodes *, 
  fascism , and nazism , can apply to peoples of any nation . 
  with that said , fascists are n't the most clear thinking bunch to start with . 
  doing god 's work , bot . 
  i think it was because they seriously intended on following their campaign promises , which puts them at odds with the rest of europe and as such the media in these states will be negative . 
  of course now that 's all changed , syriza now is not the same as it was in the first weeks after the election . 
  open borders . 
  it 's moved way more to the right , politically . 
  the issue here is that , even discounting the sexist social attitudes towards women ( assertive women = bitchy , assertive men = confident , etc. 
  ) , things that are part of human life like having a child are squared off onto the mother . 
  the mother is expected to and pressured to take time off work to care for the child - if they have a husband to provide .
