  nah , i would n't say over a year . 
  a good 4 or 5 months though since our last gypsy thread . 
   oh , now i see . 
  only socialist branches of anarchism are the real anarchism , so of course anarchism is a socialist ideology . 
  how aptly . 
  so you have no argument , therefore you 're going to resort to being pedantic ? 
  let me be very specific for you , then . 
  * all mainstream anarchist movements are socialist , almost all notable anarchists in history have been socialists , the biggest mainstream anarchist today , is socialist , when people refer to `` anarchists '' they refer to socialist anarchists , otherwise they specify which anarchist it is * *** furthermore *** , i specifically mentioned the likes of anarcho-capitalism in my comment , where your comment said `` i do n't see anything socialist about anarchism '' , and i *** expressly *** refuted that . 
   yeah , i heard that before , no real socialism no , i said `` no fixed definition '' . 
  i understand that english is not your first language , but that does n't give you an excuse to lie . 
   how unfortunate that every time someone tried to implement marxist ideology in real world all we got was genocide , slavery , dictatorship , suffering and hunger . 
  as opposed to this never happening under capitalism ...  but of course , you will tell me that the ideology is flawless just the people implementing made mistakes so it was n't `` real socialism/communism/whatever '' never once have i said that . 
  point exactly to where i said that . 
  otherwise you 're putting words in my mouth ( typical of you ) . 
   if ideology fails one time , it could be that it was implemented wrongly . 
  if it fails every time - there 's probably something wrong with ideology . 
  shitty logic that makes absolutely no sense . 
  if you try something once and it fails , then it has failed every time and it can never be tried again . 
  by your logic . 
   i ca n't wrap my head around the fact that there are still people treating marx 's works seriously in 21th century . 
  it was proven to be wrong multiple times . 
  it 's a dead end . 
  a lysenkoism , a creation science of ideologies . 
  except it has consistently be proven right , so i do n't know where you 're getting that from . 
  [ x ] you have n't understood corporations, 
  [ anarcho-communism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anarchist_communism ) [ libertarian socialism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libertarian_socialism ) [ anarcho-syndicalism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anarcho-syndicalism ) [ anarcho-socialism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_anarchism ) not to mention leftwing , post-left , collectivist , left-wing market , and more . 
  anarchism is almost entirely comprised of anti-capitalist movements , and even movements that are not anti-capitalist by ideology are filled with anti-capitalists , with the exception of anarcho-capitalism ( i.e. 
  right libertarianism ) - and as a result they almost invariably drift towards socialism/communism . 
  socialism is has no fixed definition ; not the degenerated worker 's state of the ussr . 
  the ussr was a byproduct of marxist-leninism , a socialist tendency , yes , but one of dozens . 
  if you insist , however , that there is a single definition of socialism and that the ussr was it , that just makes you closed minded . 
  for example , the communists/socialists that fought in catalonia during the spanish civil war were predominantly anarchists of some variation . 
  paris commune , for another example , was run mainly by anarcho-syndicalists and other revolutionary socialists . 
  and i can probably find more . 
  regardless , there is *** plenty *** about anarchism that is socialist . 
  it 's the most widely accessed as it 's published by the socialist equality party , which has significant followings in canada , germany , the uk and us , but in terms of actual on-the-ground socialists , they 're no popular . 
  it 's the most widely accessed international socialist site but there are * dozens * of socialist sites so it 's all split up . 
  just to give you an example , these are the self-posts in / r/socialism about wsws http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1xc0sv/wswsorg_has_been_blacklisted/ http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/26lpg4/what_is_your_opinion_on_the_wsws_are_they_a/ http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/2e5p9j/what_activities_can_members_of_wsws_take_part_in/ http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1xhizc/keyword_search_hits_wswsorg_vs_socialistworkerorg/ http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1axy8g/is_the_socialist_equality_party_and_the_wsws/ http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1ges5l/why_do_sepwsws_reddit_supporters_consistently/ so it 's not like they 're loved by other socialists , despite their significant size . 
  in terms of size , they 're not precisely fringe , but in terms of general opinion and how other people look at them , they 're probably one of the most fringe socialist organizations around there . 
  it is personally one group i 'd rather was no associated with the left at all , and i 've gone through some [ great lengths to express this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/2dzlmo/the_deafening_silence_of_the_us_media_and/#cjuqwi1 ), 
  anarchism is a socialist tendency , which means it has everything to do with communism . 
  so you 're telling me anarchism inherently = ussr ? 
  there were ethnic canadians in need . 
   who 's the looney here ? 
  i dunno , which one of us thinks that the person who believes the free market is an infallible force of god and that by abolishing regulations only good things can happen , and that general population 's needs are secondary to the profits of big companies and hoarding of wealth ? 
  both questions have the same answer . 
  hint : it 's you, 
  \\  ancap \\  calls someone else a looney lol, 
   are we all talk ? 
  well , this is a discussion board . 
  it 's because eu citizenship is a function of citizenship of individual member states . 
  the only way eu would be able to police that is if there was only one passport for all of the eu ( so do away with irish , french etc. 
  passports ) or if they had two separate passports , which would just be confusing and annoying . 
  that 's a to-scale representation , i think . 
  most maps do n't show the sizes of countries like canada accurate . 
  you really notice it if you overlay [ alaksa onto the rest of america ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_1crih1is-cg/tsuoyflvu-i/aaaaaaaab9a/vtm0whs5sq8/s1600/alaska.png ), 
  we ca n't have a currency union without a fiscal union . 
  i would not have made the euro a currency to replace all the others until we were sure of that . 
  however , without that , i would 've used the euro as an international currency within europe to be used as a common currency for convenience so that , say , i can use euros in the uk and france as well as their domestic currencies , which helps with things like exchange rates . 
   was the ussr occupation un hungary more lenient ? 
  no , the invasion of the hungarian ssr by the soviets in the 1950 's is where the term `` tankie '' comes from . 
  a lot of people , though , underestimate how much many people in a few of the eastern bloc countries liked the [ degenerated workers ' states ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/degenerated_workers'_state ) that the pact nations were practicing . 
  that 's about as neutral as the ground really gets in this conflict . 
  i do n't know many communists or socialists that actively support russia 's stances . 
  any that do are usually considered morons . 
  [ this is what some of us thought about those spanish communists going to ukraine to fight ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/2d40a2/two_spanish_brigadists_have_joined_donbass/ ) trying to talk as if `` the left '' supports russia is just not very accurate . 
  anyone who 's spent time on the left knows that trying to get us to agree on anything is like herding cats , let alone support a regime like russia . 
  what the majority of the left * does * think , however , is that the ukrainian government is literally just as bad as the russian one , and that it 's not really very relevant that ukraine is being invaded as that does n't change who the ukrainian government is , fundamentally speaking , and therefore they 're not worth supporting . 
  what 's pretty much leading the charge on that stance is the fact that svoboda had disproportionate government power and that right sector/azov battalion is allowed to exist , which gives incredibly ultranationalist/nazi tones to the ukrainian side , to which leftists are fundamentally opposed . 
  it does n't help that the ukrainian government has attacked leftist ideology in a way not even russia has attempted ( yet ) . 
  but make no mistake , the vast majority of leftists do not support russia - organizations like wsws ( probably the most obvious example of russian shilling ) are widely disliked amongst the leftists that * are n't * wsws ( though that 's because they 're huge pieces of shit , not specifically because of russia ) - however , while leftists do n't support russia , that absolutely does not mean they support ukraine . 
  most either do n't know what to think , or think they 're both incredibly shitty , or a few minorities think either russia is still ussr in disguise and therefore it is perfect , or they think ukraine is a brand new country that is on the path to great democracy and should be supported against evil russian fascists . 
  you have to understand that leftists do not see international relations and politics in the same frame of mind as everyone else , and trying to explain it to other people is quite difficult . 
  [ it was actually humanitarian aid ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov_bread_basket ), 
  it would n't have really made much sense 20 years ago . 
   a snap icm poll for the guardian declared the snp leader the victor by a margin of 71 per cent to 29 per cent impressive, 
  nobody actually knows what to do with it . 
  it either gets dumped illegally in somalia by private corporations or it 's held in sites around the country while people figure out how to dispose of it in a more permanent fashion . 
  they have a plan for what is essentially digging a giant fucking hole in the ground and dumping waste there where it can decay for tens of thousands of years . 
  irish sea 's already polluted from nuclear waste from the brits , so knock yourself out . 
  [ this one was used 1918-1944 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/internationale-ru.ogg ), 
  no it 's not . 
  where do people come up with such ignorant bullshit when there 's so much information to be found on the internet ? 
  this is a crime of unspeakable proportions . 
  we must bring these terrorists to justice . 
  italy has always had a large muslim population as a byproduct of the muslim conquering of sicily/parts of south italy , plus it 's quite close to north africa so more people movement . 
   i 'd hope that the economic crisis is n't playing a role . 
  economics plays the primary role in such things . 
  `` zeal of the convert '' is a thing, 
  no dude , anything that does n't involve angrily yelling at the russians about how evil they are while simultaneously sending troops to ukraine is literally hitler . 
  the french were always sending us armies . 
  they were cool like that . 
  of course , they usually got shitstomped , but it 's the thought that counts . 
  [ just because everything else seems to be taken , and because some modern anthems are based on it , i 'll go with l'internationale , which is sort of an anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuw_aabjcpe ) catchy as fuck . 
  [ here 's what it 's based on ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuw_aabjcpe ) it 's a much more slowed down version of l'internationale , still used btw , just with different words . 
   yes everyone is jumping to trust russia now because wonderful precedents were set [ 1 ] and everybody lived peacefully thereafter . 
  i 'm not talking about deals with russia ; unless russia wants to join a military alliance with europe and all that crap . 
  i 'm talking about european states . 
  international brigades - we need more of these . 
  increasing the integration/cooperation of european forces , particularly with states that feel threatened by russia , and having them deployed in these threatened states , is as much of a guarantor for safety as any of these countries can reasonably ask for .
