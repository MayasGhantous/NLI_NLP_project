  though in context of this discussion , yeah , i suppose it 's pretty fucking nazi . 
  a large protest gets suppressed by the police and then turns violent ; what do you expect people to do ? 
  one where protesters are not broken up by riot police or threatened and intimidated by hired guns with government uniforms , where journalists do n't have their rooms and offices raided and their stuff stolen and broken , where the people can expose the wrongdoings of their governments without reprisal , where people are not threatened and intimidated by their governments and where we are not kept under the government 's watchful eyes day and night for `` national security '' . 
  the idea that the western world is somehow not a police state is the biggest myth of our time . 
  we 're all police states with a sugary coating , it just turns out that sugar has rotted the teeth of americans . 
  `` freedom '' is farcical and only exists so long as your submit to your respective governments . 
  the catholic church does not `` rule '' ireland and has n't since the early 90 's , thank fuck . 
  that does n't mean we 're not an incredibly conservative country anyways . 
  our constitution is incredibly influenced by the catholic church - which is why we 're locked into these laws because the irish people have no way to force legislation in the government . 
  every change of this nature requires an amendment to our constitution , which requires the government willpower to change it and then it gets put to a vote . 
  there was supposed to be a constitutional convention to sort all that shit out and draft us a new one , this government , but it got delayed indefinitely ( i.e. 
  not going to happen ) . 
  no , we have to wait for government initiatives to change the constitution in a way they deem fit , then we vote on the options they give us . 
  they 're a vocal minority but they 're also a significant voting base .

  wahabbism should be banned from entering europe . 
  that thing 's a fucking cancer on the planet . 
  exhibit a : isil, 
  the fact that there exists a place where corporations are the voters instead of people is mind boggling to me . 
  please no , let 's not destroy ukraine 's domestic market . 
  they have no problem with food . 
  this comes in the wake of something that is nothing short of a horrific crime perpetuated by the state , where a victim of violent rape was [ denied access to an abortion ] ( https://twitter.com/hilarylennon/status/500934970836545537/photo/1 ) on the basis of our archaic and outdated laws as a byproduct of christian religious influence in our constitution .

  no guys , really , we 're not owned by corporations , we swear !,

  [ what people think ireland looks like ... ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/ireland_-_plains_of_south_kildare.jpg ) [ i present to you ... ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/burren_0513.jpg ) the burren . 
   how many other occupations and conflicts are you against ? 
  all of them . 
  if you can stop being racist now , that would be nice . 
  yeah , sure . 
  no , i do n't think being raised areligiously in a predominantly catholic , secular western country biases me towards palestinians . 
  and what you just said is racist/wideranging offensive stereotype . 
  but , hey , if you want to attribute being against war crimes and foreign occupation as an islamic policy , go ahead , i do n't think any will complain . 
  ah right , i was born to muslim parents ( but not raised as muslim ) and lived in ireland , so they 're stuck in my head as `` middle names '' . 
   i do n't count passing through places on the train as having been to them . 
  you 're not missing much with louth . 
  yeah , that 's what i was trying to impart . 
  in my example , muhammad would be the grandfather . 
  figured him skipping over louth on the map might 've been an accident . 
  i dunno , i think he 's some sort of british or irish individual anyways . 
  well , it 's austral ** asia ** to be sure . 
   ireland is now included , using a 101 km tunnel from dublin to holyhead . 
  if this were to ever happen , irish people would be so pleased . 
  it 's where all the good weather is haha, 
   now here is a candy and please move out of this continent yeah , no . 
  i 'd never seen a picture of orb\u00e1n until now . 
  guys looks like he 's some villain . 
  northern irish ? 
  took quite a bit of googling ( like 2 mins which is an eternity in internet time ) but i found it ; http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140118201217/althistory/images/e/e4/europe_county_map.png, 
  so far what 's come out of you ; * racism * complaining that people call you out on it, 
  when you come up with something that is n't racist shit i 'll consider you worth my time to take seriously . 
  what , so we ca n't fix everything so we do absolutely nothing ? 
  great solution to the world 's problems . 
  dae think all arabs are the same person and are part of a massive conspiracy ? 
  every thread , everywhere , to do with the middle east you spam this . 
  spam it . 
  with nothing to support your statements . 
  absolutely nothing . 
  you 're also the same person that said antisemitism was an islamic practice . 
  * clearly * you are the most informed , unbiased and non-sectarian/xenophobic individual here . 
  the only thing muslims have in common is that they 're muslims . 
  to state that they 're `` one group '' would be to say that poles are the same as russians because they 're both slavic . 
  not exactly . 
  muhammed ( and variants ) are all very common as first names , but the way islamic naming conventions work is that your middle names are the names of your ancestors . 
  using myself as an example ( fake names obviously ) , i would be sami hassan muhammad zachy el-sayed , where each name along the line would be an older generation . 
  i 'm not quite sure how that gets accounted for in these statistics .

   a force for good in the world lolwut, 
  like the un actually matters for shit . 
  it 's a paper tiger that stamps things with approval for some bonus points politically , if it denied the intervention it would n't have mattered . 
  hurr durr white flag surrender monkey, 
  we should 've gotten rid of nuclear weapons years ago . 
  everyone . 
  the amount of times we 've nearly blown ourselves up is insane . 
  it depends on where you draw the line . 
  a lot of ireland 's history is n't well documented , the celts did n't like writing . 
  if you google `` ireland 's oldest city '' you 'll get waterford , around 914 a.d. 
  but there 's references to settlements where dublin is today around 2,000 years ago . 
  so it 's still up to debate i suppose . 
  maybe she can ban poverty while she 's at it . 
  that 's pretty modern . 
  there is no way in hell ukraine has lost 10,000 troops and has n't sued for peace by now . 
  that 's over a tenth of its fighting force . 
  and there 's no way they 'd keep that many deaths under wraps , the separatists would be screaming it . 
  the reality is that the average rank and file soldier knows as little about what 's going on as we do , and it 's like that for a reason . 
  look at that baby . 
  all muslim . 
  you can see the evil in his eyes . 
  lol wtf, 
   you can . 
  why ca n't you ? 
  you just said it was a trade off . 
  can we stop this ? 
   that is about as bad as things have gotten in the last half a century in this `` corrupt '' system . 
  really ?
