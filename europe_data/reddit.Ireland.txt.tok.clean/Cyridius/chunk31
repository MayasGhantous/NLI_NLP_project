  what about the 28 labourers that got shot ? 
  the people who did it are walking free . 
  or how about the financial terrorism brought upon the people of europe by investors that were protected by the ecb and our governments ? 
  and that 's not even the half of it . 
  not even close to half . 
  not even a quarter . 
  i ca n't believe you 'd say `` that is about as bad as things have gotten '' . 
  and no shit you prefer it to syria and iraq . 
  there 's a dramatic difference between a failed system that actively works against the general population in the interests of a few people , and a failed system that does not work , period . 
   and the less influence it has on the international stage . 
  it 's a tradeoff . 
  why would i care about prestige and dick swinging contests on the international stage if i ca n't vote for a government that enacts policies in our interests domestically ? 
  i 'm a federalist from an internationalist perspective . 
  but there 's so much wrong with a federal europe from my point of view , ideologically speaking . 
  * it will use its position of strength to get into wars like the us and russia * it , like all governments , does n't know how to fix the new economic problems we 're facing . 
  * it makes it harder for citizens to make real change in their countries . 
  a citizen 's involvement in democracy gets progressively more insignificant the larger the country/population . 
  * looking at all the european parties in the ep , i feel pretty sad at the thought that those are our political future . 
  they all seem pretty much the same to me , as evidenced by the fact that the so-called socialists are working with the so-called conservatives . 
  it , like all governments , will be another race to the centre of the spectrum . 
  so , it 's not that i oppose a federal europe on principal . 
  it 's just that if i 'm going for a federal europe , i want something in it that * actually improves our democracy * . 
  i do n't see how this does . 
  there 's nothing new in the system , it 's the same old , corruptible , ideologically bankrupt parliaments that we have in our own countries . 
  oh * yeah * , how dare the people have a second decision on a treaty when more information is brought to light ? 
  * clearly * these things are set in stone after the first vote and can never be discussed again under any circumstances , * especially * when new information concerning the key issues is available . 
  its a political union whether you like it or not, 
  and tell me , what happens when the justice system is corrupt ? 
  well , what * did * they expect ? 
  syria is no place for europeans , it 's worse than going to afghanistan at the height of the insurgency . 
  organisations are * constantly * kidnapping europeans to use for ransom money , because we pay . 
  obviously we should help them , but it 's a case of `` wow , you 're fucking dumb '' . 
  i 'm feeling some unsavory thoughts coming from your direction , citizen . 
  cease them immediately . 
  and pick up that can . 
  you do n't seem to know very much about [ larkin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_larkin ) . 
  revolutionary syndicalist ? 
  founder of [ itgwu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_transport_and_general_workers'_union ) ? 
  founder of the [ irish citizen 's army ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_citizen_army ) ? 
  left the country after the [ lockout ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_lock-out ) ? 
  came back in the 20 's and founded the [ irish worker 's league ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_worker_league ) , which was communist ? 
  tell me , precisely , what it is that i do n't understand , again ? 
  a descendant of charlemagne , clearly . 
   on human rights , the united states must be a beacon . 
  and i stopped there . 
  i was tempted to at the `` why america should care '' part , was pretty close at `` american ideals . 
  universal values '' . 
  but i could n't go further after that . 
  [ james `` big jim '' larkin ] ( http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e7/ff/6a/jim-larkin-statue-on.jpg ) , syndicalist , communist , unioniser . 
  that was a really good video of dublin imo, 
  but we 're not one entity , so we should n't count ourselves as one . 
  laurels are very roman empire . 
  we need to lobby for this * right now * . 
  [ this is the closest i 've found ] ( http://i962.photobucket.com/albums/ae101/legiazus/ah%20flags/imperialeu.jpg ), 
  i 've seen a red/white version of that flag before . 
  [ also , european empire ] ( http://i962.photobucket.com/albums/ae101/legiazus/ah%20flags/imperialeu.jpg ) [ and there 's this , dunno what it 's from ] ( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131107204613/callofduty/images/1/15/flag_of_the_federation_of_the_americas.png ), 
  oh , there 's a few , so i 'm gon na put down 3 jus ' cus fuck da police . 
  i 'm not a fan of most more `` contemporary '' music ( eg . 
  bono/u2 ) so most of the shit i listen to from ireland is politically orientated [ only our rivers run free ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prqznzvd3fi ) [ irish citizen 's army ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf0avxwadn4 ) [ james connolly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9axxwwdtyc ), 
  nobody expects the german inquisition . 
  [ yeah ? 
  well ours has more explosions and music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9akqgz_-bq ) and like [ artillery and shit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw_741b6ugq ) . 
  they have a youtube channel dedicated to dispensing unimpressive videos lol, 
  i just copy/paste the checkmarks from the internet . 
  i got bored of that so i set up a macro using res so i just clicked a button and they appear res \u2611, 
  something something black gold something something mercenaries something something blood for oil, 
  [ maybe it 's a case of ... ] ( http://meme5.net/#i=meme-morpheus;t=what_if_i_told_you_denmark_has_no_sovreign_soil;b=because_it~27s_subservient_to_the_usa~3f; ), 
  it 's a bit of a myth that communism was an eastern phenomenon . 
  it was * very * strong in the west . 
  there 's no country anywhere that has n't had very strong communists ( except for maybe countries like ireland or the uk where they were extremely divided ) . 
  communists/socialists probably got elected to local councils and so on . 
  yes , the term is `` dictatorship of the proletariat '' i.e. 
  99.999 % of the people rule by exerting a monopoly on force on the .001 %, 
  communism was quite strong in the us before the second red scare/mccarthyism . 
  some people just get the statutes to stop them being thrown in some dump somewhere . 
  i know that 's how the one in seattle came to be ( coincidentally , seattle is , nowadays , one of the forefronts for socialism in america ) . 
  nice , that 's a bit like having a piece of the berlin wall , except not everybody has one . 
  it 's a contentious topic . 
  he died before he could do anything useful . 
  keep in mind that after the 1917 revolution that the rfsr was in civil war until 1922 , so there was n't really much room to do anything good for anybody when they were spending their time trying to secure power and stop themselves being overthrown by tsarists , and the man himself died in 1924 . 
  it 's one of the main reasons why i do n't understand all this ideologically driven hate for lenin , like everything bad that happened in the world from 1917-1991 was his fault . 
  what was it that lenin did that particularly made him disgraceful ? 
  more disgraceful than the hundreds of other political figures that have statues dedicated to them , that is . 
  well the ussr and sfry were n't exactly best friends . 
  awesome , how 'd you get it ? 
  poland 's is funny , not sure if it 's just meant to be vulgar humor or meant to be some sort of satire that i 'm not getting . 
  i 'm a socialist and even i admit lenin did n't create a `` utopia '' , lol, 
  you realize karl marx was an economist and marxism is a critique of capitalism and nothing more , right ? 
  of course you do n't , that would require you to know what you 're talking about . 
  i was gon na ask `` why does everyone wan na tear these down so much ? 
  '' , then i remembered why the ira blew up nelson 's pillar . 
  oh wow i did n't know countries actually used reverse osmosis as a primary source for water . 
  that must make it pretty expensive over there . 
  if you do n't have any lakes or anything , where do you guys get your water ? 
  dense populations or cities usually take longer to traverse . 
  taking ireland for example , it can as long as 2 hours to get from one end of dublin city to the other ; yet it would take about the same amount of time to travel from cork ( south ireland ) to dublin . 
  rekt \u2612 not rekt \u2610, 
  i 'm not sure if it would ; maltese , unlike romanian and other latin languages , is derived from arabic quite extensively . 
  it 's a semitic language . 
  the irish and swedes worked pretty well together in the 60 's .
