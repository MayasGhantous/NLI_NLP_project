  it 's our cooperation with sweden ( and finland as well ) in un peacekeeping that was one of the deciding factors in our being part of the nordic battlegroup . 
   why do you say that ? 
  because almost every country that escaped being occupied by either axis or allies did so by being underhanded and partial to one side or another , and it was 75 years ago , if norwegians are still annoyed about things that sweden did in wwii , they have problems . 
  there 's been so many times people have been executed in the us only to be found innocent after the fact . 
  or so many cases where the issue is highly up to contention either due to poor/potentially fabricated evidence or trial errors . 
  in a cell they have a chance to appeal and get out . 
  you 're the same as the saudis and chinese . 
  great standards to hold yourself to . 
  now we just need to maintain that for 15 consecutive years and we 're home free !, 
  we have a huge property bubble forming in our capital city atm . 
  not anywhere near enough houses to keep up with demand . 
  hey , at least he 's not fucking kiddies like the clerics of a certain religion that 's mainstream . 
  one of the possible meanings . 
  french is tricky like that . 
  `` university of dublin '' , known more as `` trinity college '' after the more official name `` college of the holy and undivided trinity of queen elizabeth '', 
  i do n't know what you 're talking about with `` genocide in europe '' but kuwait was a far more nuanced conflict , and the usa intervened for its own interests , not on some humanitarian mission . 
  afghanistan did n't attack anyone and the [ taliban offered bin laden ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/14/afghanistan.terrorism5 ) up almost straight away . 
  and at the end of it all , the us never found him in afghanistan . 
  that war was one of opportunity . 
  the un does not do anything without the us 's approval , it 's league of nations 2.0 so do n't pretend that was forced on america . 
  case in point ; israel . 
  no concrete resolution has gone through because america , against every other country in the world , has veto 'd it . 
  keep in mind israel is committing crimes in palestine that america has allegedly bombed other countries to prevent . 
  i 'm not doing any strawmans here . 
  you 're the one repeatedly bringing up genocide , stalin , and all other kinds of bullshit as if it 's relevant to this conversation . 
  you 're the only person using strawman here . 
  fair enough . 
  i 'm no fan of the russian media machine . 
  none of the kurdish populations really agree politically , from what i understand, 
  i 'm sure there 's a reference here that i 'm missing . 
  there 's a lot of variation in how people think that problem can be addressed . 
  no , you 're using strawman arguments here . 
  saying that it was a geopolitical disaster that the major counterbalance to the usa collapsed is not saying `` i fucking love the ussr they 're the best shit ever lenin aliv in russia '' . 
  the third reich had no such level of importance at any stage of its existence , but nice try failing at invoking godwin 's law . 
  i 'm not apologizing for anything . 
  grow up . 
  that shit was ridiculous . 
  1st gulf war somalia bosnia haiti kosovo afghanistan 2nd gulf war libya and if we want we can throw in iraq again , which would make it 9 . 
  but i tend to include that with the 2nd gulf war , because it 's an byproduct of what happened after the usa destabilized the middle east . 
  but hey , you can go be cool with your outdated and inaccurate stalin references , and i 'll just stick to being mature . 
  it 's removing the positions of power . 
  if we simply knock one elite out but keep the hierarchy , someone else will come in and fill their place as the new elite . 
  if people refuse to recognize a power structure exists , it simply can not function . 
  we 're in a position where we 're subconsciously submitting to a hierarchy that , if you think about it , has no real justification . 
  it just so happens today , as for centuries , that the elites have covered themselves in the fabric of legitimacy and benevolence ; instead of the divine right of kings or the natural order , or how they protect us against other feudal lords and care for their serfs , they 're now the `` self-made '' businessmen , the international corporations , the `` job creators '' . 
  disaster is a term used depending on perspective . 
  if you 're the kind of person that does n't like foreign interventions , then it was a disaster . 
  why is it that if anyone disagrees with your views it 's `` whitewashing putin 's words '' ? 
  it 's a legitimate view to hold , entirely independent of putin . 
  and i 'd love to see independent russia invade iraq or bomb libya . 
  keeping in mind as well that chechnya was not an intervention on foreign soil , it was part of the russia federation and an entirely internal issue , though i do n't agree with what russia did in that situation in the slightest . 
  if you want to talk about russian imperialism vs. american imperialism , the motives and goals are dramatically different and russia plays the small game of regional interests where america plays the big game of global control . 
  try arguing that today 's isis crisis is not a byproduct of what america did over a decade ago . 
  * that * is a visible effect . 
  the context behind the interventions russia did at the early-mid 90 's was very different to what they 're doing decades later , and is * certainly * different to what america has been doing . 
  i do n't agree with anything about what russia 's doing , but and yes i suppose `` event '' or `` development '' are more neutral words , but that would imply that i 'm neutral about their occurrence ; i think for geopolitics , the collapse of the ussr was a * bad * thing . 
  hell , even socially speaking it was possibly one of the worst humanitarian events in the post-world war 2 era , that shock-transfer from the soviet systems to the new liberal ones . 
  all i 'm saying , is that without the ussr as a counterbalance to america , the usa has been able to run roughshod over the entire planet on a whim for the past few decades . 
  yeah , russia has been fucking with its immediate neighbours , but it had and still does not have , nowhere * near * the hegemonic control the usa has , and that 's indicated by how isolated it immediately became when it tried to enforce its will on a neighbouring nation , in contrast to the relatively non-existent consequences for the us for similar situations . 
  it is a tricky thing , but it 's also something that we ca n't do in the current political constructs because the elites make all the decisions . 
  governments are managed by the wealthy , therefore will oppose any initiative to redistribute wealth in a serious manner simply will not work . 
  the only time there is exception to this rule is when countries are so small that there 's large levels of social mobility and the distance between a politician and the people he rules is essentially nonexistent , and even then it 's only in certain situations when the country has specific things to its advantage . 
  the most logical solution in the other situations is simply to remove all the elites , therefore allowing governments to accurately represent the people and act in their interests as opposed to the interests of the wealthy . 
  a radical solution , but if it were not for radical solutions we 'd still be serfs or slaves !, 
  the problem is that entire families are emigrating , or it 's people with no ties to home . 
  the whole freedom of movement deal has let entire families move around where before it would 've just been the bread winners going abroad to get work and they would ** send back ** the money , where it would be spent ** at home ** which would help stimulate local economy . 
  that 's not happening . 
  entire villages in places like bulgaria are entirely depopulated , and it 's like a blend of a socially developed society with an undeveloped economy ; people are not getting married so young as they used to and having families , so they 're leaving nobody behind to send money back to when they leave . 
  and , realistically speaking , `` european solidarity '' is a joke and it 's why the idea of a federal europe happening any time soon is so unbelievable . 
  more from the ukrainian propaganda ministry coming up next !, 
  back to you , reddit . 
  `` yeah , does n't matter if you were born here , raised here , and spent your entire life here , you do n't get the same rights a anyone else because your parents were immigrants . 
  have fun ! '', 
  how about we do n't shit all over immigrant populations and then complain when they do n't integrate well ? 
  where 's the single-strike system for `` natives '' ? 
  [ they 've armed kurds recently ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/08/iraq-kurds-isis_n_5663739.html ) though , yeah , from what i understand maliki 's stance was untenable , though he 's saying he does n't recognize the new pm , so things could get out of hand . 
  the arms will filter into syria one way or another . 
  there are kurds fighting for independence in syria , should the iraqi kurds split off , the arms we give them now could well be given to the syrian kurds , which in the long run means western arms circulating around syria . 
  the iraqi government has been arming the kurds themselves already . 
  it 's a desperate situation . 
  i doubt it 'll be massive but if it 's enough to do the story justice then i 'll be happy . 
  it 's not cheap or a strawman , it 's fucking realistic . 
  we have to talk about the crown dependencies because they 're a part of the problem ; if ireland does as you want today and end its tax haven status , all we 've done is fucked ourselves . 
  the problem still exists for virtually everybody else . 
  why would we do that to ourselves and have virtually no benefit for either ourselves or everyone else ? 
  it makes no sense . 
  this is very much an issue that needs to be solved cooperatively , not by picking on weaker states until they capitulate so the next guy in line can take its place . 
  tax havens are not a localized issue ; they are a * global * issue . 
  picking on individual countries is * precisely * how nothing gets done , and the only reason people do it is to get bonus points politically , everyone knows it 's not going to change unless * everyone * is serious about ending them . 
  and i just explained to you why picking on ireland is a pointless endeavor . 
  look at your crown dependencies , which are a magnitude more severe in their tax haven status , and when that 's done you can criticize us . 
  i 'd rather not cut my leg off to save your little finger , if that 's what you 're asking . 
  there 's no `` global wealth disparity '' being caused by our policies and that 's a ridiculous myth . 
  if we stopped doing what we 're doing they 'd move to the next biggest tax haven - like one of the many british overseas territories or crown dependencies which are classified as actual tax havens , unlike ireland , which is , at worst , a `` semi-tax haven '' , like the netherlands . 
  but hey , if the uk fixes all of its numerous tax havens ( isle of man , jersey , virgin isles , bermuda , caymans ) , the usa fixes its tax havens ( puerto rico and delaware ) , the netherlands fix its semi-tax haven status , and luxemburg and switzerland get rid of their own tax haven , then i might support my country working to do the same . 
  until then , get off your high horse , thanks . 
  yeah , let 's oppress minorities and have a system to deport them to countries they 're not form , that 's always worked out well and definitely wont ever backfire . 
  yet we will dismiss anything coming out of russia on the basis that it 's russian . 
  if we 're going to take that approach , we ought to be consistent on that , no ? 
  why would any company stay if we removed their incentives ?
