  and after that , leaving dozens of countries either in civil war or under the rule of brutal dictators . 
  saudi arabia , iran , iraq , syria , israel-palestine , egypt , libya , morocco , algeria , tunisia , sudan , and many others - all are the way they are today because of capitalism , because capitalism does not see the need to ensure the people living in these countries have any of the same rights as we do , because there 's no profit from that . 
  not to mention things like how the [ usa constantly oppressed anti-capitalist movements globally ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_condor ) , or how [ it tried to constantly topple anti-capitalist regimes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bay_of_pigs_invasion ) , or [ how it spread propaganda and brainwashed the population against anti-capitalist movements ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_scare ) , you do n't need to be communist to have dirty hands , any anyone with common sense knows that one . 
  maybe you have n't heard about the kaesong complex ? 
  where south koreans go to get slave labour off of north koreans , much to the detriment of their own people , obviously . 
  but hey , norks are cheaper labour !, 
  or maybe you never heard about [ south korea 's us-backed dictator ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syngman_rhee#political_repression ) not like it 's a rare thing when [ fight for `` freedom '' and all that ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_vietnam ) or maybe you do n't know about how israel 's economic growth is intrinsically tied to the cheap labour it gets from the palestinians who 's land they 've stolen due to its settlement policies ? 
  or how about how the usa [ constantly suppressed labour movements in south america ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banana_massacre ) so that its own corporations could maintain cheap labour ? 
  or how about that time belgium got a region to secede and then [ propped it up , so its corporations could maintain control of the mining sectors ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congo_crisis ) do those sound like the actions and results of benevolent , non-authoritarian regimes , to you ? 
  define `` authoritarian & invasive '' , one could easily argue that the usa is authoritarian and invasive . 
  if you mean totalitarian police state , then you 're going to struggle to explain to me how every attempt at socialism has deteriorated to totalitarian police states , because it simply is n't true . 
  he 's an `` anarcho '' - capitalist , do n't be surprised if it 's incoherent . 
   there are more examples of it in communist countries than capitalist countries . 
  no there are n't . 
  what i 've *** never *** understood about americans is why criticism of capitalism is so damn taboo in your society . 
  it is n't a perfect system . 
  not even close . 
  marx was n't some revolutionary ; he was an * economist * , who produced * critiques * of capitalism , which at the time of his writings , was a relatively new economic system . 
  his line of thought was n't `` fuck these bourgeois liberal fucks '' , it was `` well , this system is a massive improvement over the last one , here 's all the good things it does , here 's who it benefits , here 's who does n't benefit , here 's where it goes in the long run , and * here * , is what we can do better '' most of us these days have * no desire * to revisit the soviet union . 
  most of us follow left communism , trotskyism , anarchism , or some form of democratic socialism ( which back in the day was called social democracy ) . 
  marxist-leninism is not a common ideology . 
  wander over to / r/socialism some time and take a look at the flairs . 
  stalinists/maoists/marxist-leninists are pretty damn rare . 
  in fact , a lot of socialists are something called `` market socialists '' which advocate keeping the market but having it so it 's worker owned businesses competing instead of traditional capitalist ones . 
  you may think marx/marxism is some giant boogeyman , but he/it * does * present legitimate critiques of capitalism and all you need to do is read through marx 's ( admittedly boring ) works to see that . 
  it 's become * slightly * more progressive because most of the rabid racists moved to / r/european . 
  but there does n't go a day without a massive , popular show of racism . 
  but at least it is n't constant anymore . 
  what did i miss ? 
  straight from china . 
  there 's obviously . 
  china does n't do spheres of influence , and even if it did all of its neighbours would be outside of it . 
  asia has far too much conflict between nations for a system like europe to evolve ; we have our `` spheres of influence '' here because of the cold war and the east-west divide ; asia did n't have that , it was * real * war over there and * real * conflict . 
  that 's a general leftist saying , i believe . 
  when worst comes to worst , the social democrats will choose the capitalist establishment over you . 
  good luck with that . 
  that 's not how downvoting works . 
  `` fuck you russian this is n't against you it 's against putin do n't you sick russian fucks understand ? '', 
  yeah how dare anyone have an opinion on anything ? 
  fuck scum , they should let cameron and the party do all their thinking for them . 
  again , a deflection ; `` you 're the real racist here , not me , the person saying racist stuff '' are you an actual nazi ? 
  that might put this in context . 
  the idf has n't fought another military in 40 years . 
  i would n't even begin to call the `` most moral army in the world '' one of the best until they fight an actual army in their current generation 's lifetime . 
  the deathtoll in gaza does n't speak to competence or professionalism , just better technology . 
  that 's all besides the point . 
  my concern is , like with muslims going off to fight abroad in this or that organization , that when they come back they will be radicalized . 
  a jew going off to fight in the idf is already a person with extremist leanings , now imagine they come back after a tour in the idf , and i think the muslims here should have as much cause to be worried as people are about the muslims who come back from abroad . 
  there are * thousands * of people with dual-citizenship fighting in the idf ; most of them are americans , but hundreds of them are european . 
  that 's as legitimate a concern for us who do n't want to bring external conflicts home . 
  i 'll say the same thing for ukraine , and syria , and libya , and anywhere else . 
  if we 're going to be passing judgement on people who go abroad to fight ideological wars , we should at least be consistent about it . 
  again you 're painting them all with one brush . 
  the bolsheviks in russia also had the `` approval '' of the jews in germany . 
  more nazi rhetoric . 
  at the same time we 're allowing these people to go off to war and come out highly militarized and indoctrinated people . 
  especially with no formal network like with our own military forces to aid in reintegration into civilian society , we could find ourselves with extremely violent , radicalized individuals walking our streets , and who knows what they 'd do ? 
  we all know that the idf is , contrary to saying , * not * the most moral army in the world , and similarly organizations such as isis get into some pretty nasty shit , surely radicalized jews and muslims is something we should be worried about ? 
  and the same goes for people who go off to fight in eastern ukraine , of which there are quite a few . 
  you do n't join the military to be safe . 
  should we stop them coming back ? 
  i ` ts a bit of a shit show . 
  astroturfing is incredibly common , a lot of people only really heard about it from russia doing it but the israelis mastered that shit a decade ago . 
  a deflection ; standard response when confronted with the reality of precisely what it is your are saying . 
  you know full well what i said and meant . 
  next will be denial ; `` i never said that about muslims ! '', 
  tell me , what is it that `` moderate '' muslims must do to satisfy you enough to counter your entirely baseless statement that they 're working in league with extremist muslims ? 
  this idea that moderate muslims are responsible for what extremists do is exactly , word for word , what the nazis did to the jews . 
  you are spewing nazi rhetoric . 
  did n't know muslims all shared the same hive mind and could predict what everyone is doing at every moment of the day . 
  that must help with their conspiracy to take over the world . 
  because they spend billions on money that trickles down to people , who then spend it ... keynesian economics , man . 
  government stimulus gives people purchasing power , who then go and purchase stuff and stimulate the economy . 
  but when they 're white `` natives '' it 's a social issue , it 's *** never *** a social issue when it 's the muslims . 
  you see , they 're actually part of a conspiracy where they take advantage of they 're untouchable status to mindless cause violence and mayhem because they 're naturally barbaric people . 
  * just like the jews and the gypsies , do n't you see !? 
  how dare you suggest that economic conditions can shape social behaviour of a group that 's strongly effected by the economy ? 
  we all know it 's genetics . 
  they are * frequently * criticized by the majority , it just does n't get news coverage because it does n't buy into the anti-islam conspiracies that grab headlines . 
  this sounds a lot like theories nazis would say about the jews . 
  but we know it 's different this time because the billion + muslims in the world are all part of a grand conspiracy . 
  white rights , 4chan , stormfront , great apes , take your pick , they all frequent this sub . 
  no dude if you want it to work you got ta remove the / s, 
  that 's moronic as fuck . 
  you might be able to get away with it when you talk about arabs from the middle east who are very culturally similar , but there 's dramatic differences between a muslim in morocco and a muslim in indonesia . 
  or how about bosnian or albanian muslims ? 
  muslims are not a homogenous or even remotely uniform group ; in fact they 're the complete opposite . 
  well it 's a trillion dollar business . 
  if the us keeps bombing the fuck out of countries , they 'll spend billions upon billions buying from manufacturers to replenish their supplies , or buy their research . 
  assuming that money trickled down , which it would n't , but assuming it did , then the people at the bottom would have more money . 
  if they have more money they 'll buy more things . 
  if they buy more things they 'll stimulate business . 
  stimulating business is good for the economy . 
  again , * assuming * trickle down , it would be good for the same reason an increase in things like the minimum wage would be good ; more purchasing power amongst the workers --  larger middle class --  more stuff purchased --  more revenue for business --  stimulated economy . 
  common sense ? 
  give your workers more purchasing power and they 'll buy more stuff , which stimulates the economy . 
  rich people do n't stimulate the economy because they hoard wealth and all they do is buy `` rich people stuff '' like luxury jets and yachts . 
  it 's good for corporate arms dealers and mercenary companies , and it would be good for the economy in general if that money they made trickled down to the population , but it does n't , so it 's just a good money making scheme for war profiteers .
