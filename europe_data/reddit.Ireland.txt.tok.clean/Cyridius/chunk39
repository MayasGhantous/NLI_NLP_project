  they'er almost all single decker buses . 
  we have double decker buses ( as seen in the picture ) and they 're still almost always full . 
  not the only one , but i think most people will disagree . 
  catalan , basque , scots , welsh , danish , swedish , finnish , etc. 
  are all languages that can only ever be spoken by a few million people but people want to keep them alive in order to preserve their culture and national identity . 
  people have been fighting for the irish language extremely hard for the past 150 or so years . 
  that 's no the worst that goes on up there . 
  the loyalists warped him into some hero for ulster that was defending it against the tyranny of the rest of ireland . 
  i bet that japanese article with broken english that says it 's a `` right of passage '' to kill dolphins is still circulating . 
  why do you all have such small buses ? 
  small , but deadly . 
  i 'm sure / r/shitamericanssay will get shit on that . 
  where else are they gon na pawn all that pocket change they looted from the dead passengers ? 
  no , that would be logical , and we do n't believe in that . 
  yeah , just the christians are in danger , none of the shia who get flat out executed for being shia . 
  i have no problem with the bishop 's call to take in asylum seekers . 
  i 'd just rather it not be sectarian in nature , sectarianism being the main reason christians would be seeking asylum to start with . 
  none of this would 've happened has israel not blockaded gaza for years on end , going back on ** two ** peace deals they made with pa that stated they would lift the blockade . 
  none of this would 've happened had israel not continued and expanded its settlements into the west bank . 
  none of this would 've happened had israel not used the `` investigation '' into the murder to the israeli teens as an excuse to kidnap hundreds of palestinians and many hamas leaders . 
  none of this would 've happened has israel accepted the palestinian surrender from the pa that conceded all the settlements on the west bank and the right of return . 
  none of this would 've happened if israel recognized palestine as an independent state . 
  none of this would 've happened if israel negotiated directly with hamas , using words instead of bombs . 
  but hey , how dare the ~ ~ jews ~ ~ palestinians rise up against the ~ ~ nazis ~ ~ israelis ? 
  israel has a massive technological , social , and financial advantage over palestine , yet they use methods that show what a farce any social progress they 've made is . 
  when the israeli defense ministers are saying they 're going to `` visit the holocaust on gaza '' , or when they all praise the violence and murder of the idf , or when they decide that despite the fact tunnels need two entrances to work , they needed to invade gaza to get rid of them , or despite the fact that there 's 50 % more bombs and shells going * into * gaza than coming * out * of it , israel is still just defending itself against the ~ ~ subhuman filth ~ ~ terrorist palestinians . 
  it does n't matter what hamas does , israel refuses to negotiate or talk with them and considers them a terrorist organization . 
  and then israel rejected the palestinian authority 's negotiated peace that gave them all the settlements and revoked the right of return . 
  the motive is irrelevant when you instigate a war on a false premise . 
  it 's a bad idea in general . 
  the idea that information that gets out onto the news or media is `` private '' or should be `` forgotten '' is anti-democracy in that it exists to deliberate subvert informing the general population on the actions of the upper classes ( actions that are frequently against their interests ) . 
  if this law was , firstly , putting the onus on individual websites instead of on search engines , and secondly had a time lock of 3 or 4 * decades * , then i might consider it to be a good idea . 
  ceos are people . 
  so are shareholders . 
  and managers . 
  my point is that that is n't censorship , but a violation of someone 's privacy . 
  however , it is not private to , say , erase that you wrote a book and now want to hide information about that . 
  or erase that you were at a protest rally some time . 
  or erase that you were involved in this financial transaction . 
  that 's public information . 
  on the flip side , it is not that i fundamentally disagree with this right , it 's that i disagree that it 's forced onto a single , corporate entity . 
  google is going to do what it did with youtube and take everything down , as i predicted before this was ever introduced . 
  the responsibility needs to be shifted onto individual websites and networks so that * they * can decide to unlist it or not . 
  you 're trying to tell me this right to be forgotten is n't a golden bone being thrown to corporations ? 
  mcctaggart is an american , though . 
  though that 's not his worst crime by a long shot . 
  yet it is the courts , essentially a supranational entity , censoring . 
  not a private company . 
  people are being * forced * to censor . 
   if a sex tape would get to internet ( via upset ex , for example ) there 's already legislation against revenge porn in most countries . 
  it 's a violation of privacy , not a censoring of public information . 
  [ c\u00fa chulainn , maybe ? 
  i 'm not quite sure if he was alive bc or ad , but he 's one of ireland 's greatest warrior-myths , compared to achilles and hercules ] ( http://badassoftheweek.com/cuchulainn.html ), 
  nothing happened for a while . 
  then we got some cavemen on boats . 
  then we got some celts that basically fucked the cavemen into extinction . 
  and then there 's some myths and legends about kingdoms , warriors , and all that shit for a few hundred years . 
  due to us basically being celts and having an oral history well into the second millennium , we 're not really sure of the political shape of ireland and are working mostly on myths and legends with a sprinkling of facts . 
  we can surmise that there were hundreds of celtic warlords that basically did nothing but fight eachother all the time , and that was life for ireland well into the 7th century ad ( we assume ) when what we * think * was the high king of ireland ( who had suzerainty over the island ) started to be a thing . 
  but bc ireland was a dreadfully boring place, 
  something tells me he 's a country mile more democratic than the appalling dictator of azerbaijan . 
  well it 's not like bosnia is in the eu to start with . 
  if the population of the region votes for it in a free and open manner , i 'm in favour . 
  however , i think ethnic nationalism is a backward as fuck way to approach independence . 
  hmm , you 're right . 
  no , a whataboutism would be `` it 's ok for w to do z because x did y '' or things of that nature . 
  saying `` well , this has not gone well before , and it 'll probably go wrong again '' is * not * whataboutism . 
  post history . 
  lives in israel , talks shit about muslims and arabs and constantly spewing zionist crap . 
  he was asking what you were smoking . 
  i think that 's a legit question , i wan na get some of that shit . 
  american press takes its queues from the american government . 
  mainstream press in the us is not a reliable source of information , it 's just subtle about the bullshit it is feeding you whereas rt and russia tv are out in the open batshit crazy conspiracy morons . 
  the iraqi government was ? 
  that 's not a whataboutism at all , stop abusing that word . 
  it 's a mention of historical precedent . 
  the precedents may be shit , but it 's not whataboutism . 
  he did n't mention iraq once , *** you *** did . 
  this should be ukraine 's job . 
   i do n't want to make a massive reply to your comment so i 'd just ask you to google `` koran violence '' and read the passages yourself . 
  ah yes , a google search , truly giving you the best opportunity to understand the nuances and context to religious passages . 
  i do n't disagree with you generally speaking , i just think that this idea that it 's even a core islamic belief or one of the pillars is simply untrue in its very fundamentals . 
  islam is not the `` religion of peace '' that moderates like to defend it as , but it is n't exactly megaviolent nor particularly violent . 
  i 'm generally a stalwart defender of free expression , but i would n't mind isis supporters being locked the fuck up or deported to syria . 
  fuck those people . 
  i do n't want any fucking isis flags at demonstrations , it 's usually a handful of fringe piece of shit motherfuckers and it makes everyone else look bad . 
  `` hey non-americans , what do you like most about your country ? '', 
  `` american here , i know you specifically said no americans , but let me tell you about the greatest country in the world '', 
   blows my tiny american mind . 
  lol 'd, 
   like , who the fuck genuinely supports isis ? 
  some sick , ignorant fuckers . 
   but yes , i guess people who truly follow the koran would probably be supportive of isis . 
  not really , no . 
  islam does not say to go and mass execute people for being of different religions . 
  it has never said that and the belief that it ever has stems from absolute unwillingness to learn anything about the qur ` an or the context behind its passages . 
  and really , to add to that , if we started saying progressive members of x religion are not really followers of x religion , we 'd still be stoning people and burning people for apostasy . 
  not only does it politically alienate progressive and moderate followers of a religion , it also dulls momentum for any progressive change in a religion . 
  christianity used not to be as laid back as it used to be , but it is the way it is because progressives reformed things from the inside , and we need to be supporting these progressive people in islam as the * actual * muslims , instead of dismissing them and removing their credibility and relevance in an effort to demonize islam as a whole . 
  hmm there are maybe three i can come up with .
