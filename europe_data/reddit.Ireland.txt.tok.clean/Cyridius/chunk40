  of course it goes without saying that both the irish and brits know of most of these battles , generally speaking , given our historical relations . 
  there was the battle of the boyne , which was between the mostly dutch/british protestant forces against the mostly irish catholic forces , on behalf of william of orange and king james respectively . 
  after the irish defeat , which was largely based on morale and rout as opposed to actual battle losses , king james fled to france where he was able to raise an army to come back for the next battle ... 
  the battle of aughrim . 
  this was the last battle of the williamite war and the irish-french forces were on the cusp of victory , and would have won if not for a stray cannonball decapitating the french general , marquis de st ruth . 
  after his death the jacobite side collapsed and it was a williamite victory , leading to the victory of william of orange in ireland and the exile of thousands of irishmen . 
  a third battle , though i 'm not sure if it 's really that famous , would be the siege of jadotville , which took place in 1961 in the congo , which resulted in a katangan pyrrhic victory . 
   it is really interesting to see how paris and london became the only main hub for france and uk but that the german-speaking world maintained a dense network of local hubs . 
  the two capitals of their respective kingdoms vs. the decentralized nature of the holy roman empire , i 'd say . 
  the uprising was a sound idea when you 're working under the assumption that the soviet union is on your side . 
  the mistake was making that assumption . 
  except there 's a genetic variation between every single human being . 
  at what point do you draw the distinction of race ? 
  it 's an entirely arbitrary decision . 
  people just happened to settle on skin colour ( not explicitly , there are a number of things , obviously ) , as opposed to say , something like hair . 
  or eyes . 
  it 's an entirely social creation . 
  probably because it was n't really worth it/convenient enough . 
  damn immigrants . 
  wait , people actually * speak * welsh normally in wales ? 
  i thought it was like irish here . 
  after spending years opposing a war that would set worker against worker for the interests of war profiteers , the day after his death , general mobilization was declared , and two days after that , war . 
  in an effort to stop the war , juares organized general strikes in both france and germany , before being murdered by nationalist , raoul villain . 
  his wife was imprisoned for court costs after villain was acquitted , and villain spent the rest of his days in spain where he was killed by anarchists during the spanish civil war . 
  where in a time socialists across europe were abandoning their antimilitarist stance and supporting war , he stood against it and for the interests of every person in europe . 
  his party , sfio , eventually split in 1917 between the supporters of the russian revolution and the reformists , both of which exist as the communist and socialist parties respectively , though hollande 's socialist party would have juares turning in his grave . 
  jobs , you say ? 
  we 're an american vassal state , good luck with that . 
  now i want to see that graph finished with how much the employer makes from paying that . 
  i 'm not ethnically irish . 
  i 'm not ethnically irish . 
   they should have had early parliamentary elections already . 
  yeah , because having elections in the middle of a civil war is * really legitimate * . 
  i ** barely ** excuse the presidential elections because ukraine literally had no president . 
  they do , however , have a parliament with elected representatives . 
  inb4 all muslims are terror - oh , too late . 
  peace , through superior firepower . 
  how are you ever in a situation where an elephant can take a shit on you ? 
  how do you pronounce `` bitte '' ? 
  can we come too ? 
  we 're closely related . 
  depends . 
  it can be anything from ear-a , to air-uh , to air-ah, 
  no , no , no , you have to get the children , they 're not * truly * innocent . 
  you know , i 've faced a lot of racism in my life , and not * once * did i feel the need to travel across the world , kick someone off his land and claim it as my own . 
  but that 's just me . 
  the hippocratic oath is not legally binding , many doctors today do not even take it . 
   / u/bowgentle [ 5 ] [ +6 ] is one of my favourite posters , a really knowledgeable guy ( his stuff on ireland and the gfc is fantastic as well , albeit in / r/ireland [ 6 ] ) . 
  gon na have to second that , he 's pretty consistent in his quality posting . 
  trust me , from what i 've experienced they 're probably filtering out a lot . 
  they 're not sneaking it in , like . 
  it 's clear as day . 
  the racists and other forms of junk on the internet are pouring into / r/europe, 
  eh , he definitely a ` int as bad as he used to be . 
  i can actually tolerate him somewhat . 
   also i got aggressive pms for days after that . 
  i think most of us active users no dat feel, 
  this was long before the start of the war . 
  too late , your mistake has been enshrined in my comment . 
  a true testament to their manhood . 
  wait , there 's surgery for that ? 
  please do . 
  maybe while you 're gone you can reflect on how shitty `` anarcho '' - capitalism is . 
  i 'm sure i 'd love it if i could read it haha, 
  yeah , because `` personal freedom '' is what an ancap wants , ** lol ** freedom for the rich , literal slavery for everyone else . 
  i would rather live in a fascist society than that bullshit , at least then while i 'm being oppressed into slavery i 'll have a welfare state to support me . 
  i laugh how your *** entire *** counter-argument in support of anarcho-capitalism is based on pedantics and deflecting arguments by pointing at socialists . 
  that should just show how entirely shallow it is . 
   yes , but being member of this hierarchy is voluntary . 
  if you do n't like what they tell you to do you resign . 
  and then you 're dead . 
  the distinction in * actual * anarchism is non-existent . 
  hierarchy is to be abolished . 
  `` voluntary '' hierarchy or otherwise . 
  there is *** nothing *** anarchist about anarcho-capitalism . 
   honhonhon , because socialist societies are the prime examples for personal freedoms . 
  honhonhon because that was the point at all . 
   you are a lost cause , man . 
  yeah , * i 'm * the lost cause , not the person who believes abolishing regulations is a * good thing * , not the person who believes worker 's rights * do n't exit * , not the person who believes in an ideology * entirely geared towards the rich getting rich at everyone else 's expense * , not the person who wants to revisit feudalism , he 's not the lost cause , * i * am the lost cause . 
  the one thing i can safely assure myself about is that anarcho-capitalists are more fringe than nazis ( with good reason ) . 
  it 's a fucking hierarchy where one person is at the top and tells people below him what to do . 
  if businesses were n't hierarchical they * would n't be capitalist , they would be socialist * . 
  holy shit . 
  * what ? 
  * what the fuck do you think a company is ? 
  u wot ? 
  i just love the morons that call themselves anarcho-capitalists without even realizing what an oxymoron that is . 
  you realize anarchism is all about the dismantling and removal of hierarchical systems , right ? 
  and that capitalism * is a hierarchical system * ? 
  you can not be an * anarcho-capitalist * , anarchism and capitalism are polar opposites . 
  they do n't meld . 
  anarchism is a * socialist ideology * . 
  it 's like a * joke tendency * along the lines of anarcho-stalinist , which people will say * as a joke * , yet ancaps are very serious ( sadly ) . 
  so , i know from the start that people who identify as `` anarcho-capitalists '' are pretty fucking stupid to begin with . 
  i 'm not even going to delve into the depths of stupidity that go with the ideology of being an ancap to start with , because anyone with 1/8 a brain can see what happens when you remove virtually all state regulation and oversight over corporate powers . 
  being an ancap is essentially being a feudalist , given that corporations internally are tyrannical hierarchies and they would be in sole control of all the land , populations and resources . 
  that 's because we all know immigrants are n't actually people . 
  ebola is n't an airborne virus . 
  so long as our health services are tracking what 's going on , we should be fine . 
  the most worrying thing is that it can have an incubation period of up to three weeks , making it hard tondetect early .
