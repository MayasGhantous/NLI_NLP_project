  it 's unfortunate it broke out in w. africa , cus frankly the people are not educated enough and wo n't listen to the health services , and governments do n't have resources to seriously control it . 
  while it can have a mortality rate of up to 90 % , it 's an incredibly local virus and it has a very , very small likelihood of ending up here . 
  moreso if you 're an island . 
  well that explains it . 
  what a coincidence !, 
  [ memes , you say ? 
  it 's not a very democratic institution , is it ? 
  then again , our so-called democratic institutions have no problem ignoring the will of the people here , either , so not like it matters . 
   do n't forget that even the us considered kla a terrorist organization , until they found it more suitable to call them `` freedom fighters '' . 
  that 's how it always works with the us terror list . 
  same shit with saddam hussein , he was a savage terrorist dictator until they wanted to sell weapons . 
  no they fucking do n't . 
  then again , you 're an anarcho-capitalist ( i.e. 
  feudalist ) so i doubt you could tell the difference . 
  [ context ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2c11xv/reurope_is_now_a_default_subreddit_for_europeans/ ), 
  wooo we 're not relevant enough for polls !, 
  right then , if he 's not a german citizen then . 
  if he 's stateless , where can they expel him to ? 
  there is no state of palestine in existence . 
  that did n't take long . 
  and there 's every possibility it would n't . 
  the whole point of nuclear weapons is defensive use , and seeing as using them essentially means killing yourself , they 're kind of redundant are n't they ? 
  a limited , conventional war would be the most likely outcome in any conventional conflict between the u.s. and russia . 
  worst case scenario is use of tactical nuclear weapons from the russians , because they 're conventionally outmatched . 
  we all have more chance of blowing ourselves up by accident than eachother intentionally . 
  nuclear disarmament is common sense . 
  would turning off the wifi and transmitting capability ( aka flight mode ) not do the same thing ? 
  america had no real reason to propagandize against the nazis at that point , this was long before things started getting serious . 
  i think amhr\u00e1n na bhfiann a ` int that bad, 
   it 's literally just a minute of saying all english people are cunts . 
  you do n't like that ? 
   and you wouldnt call that islamism ? 
  because there 's nothing islamic about this . 
  as you said , he 's using islam as a pretext to implement backwards , archaic laws . 
   why , is the term islamism inherently negative ? 
  because it 's used with a negative connotation in this context ? 
  baseless insanity ? 
  except when the government is doing it the services are more affordable , have better working conditions and are generally far more expansive services that cater to our needs i.e. 
  they are not entirely driven by profit motive . 
   the deliver services for example could be a private companies that would compete for contract with local post offices . 
  and then what happens in the long term is that those companies drive up the prices and the government owned post offices ca n't move anything as cheaply as they could previously . 
   private companies maximize profits and strive for efficiency . 
  and they do that by lowering the quality of the service to cut costs and then driving up prices . 
  they attempt to maximize profits with the * least effort * and this has consistently proven to be the situation every time a major national service gets privatized . 
  the quality goes down and the prices go up . 
  public ones do n't need that incentive because every dime of tax payer money goes straight back to services provided to the tax payer , whereas in a privatized service where the primary interest is turning a profit , the services need to get massively cut , people need to get laid off , and the quality needs to go down . 
  this always leads to worse services provided for the consumer , poorer working conditions for the workers in the service , and higher costs for the consumer . 
  if they 're getting subsidies on top of that ( as they usually do ) , we get all of the above + our taxes go towards it as well as an extra cost . 
  the way i see it , it 's just an entirely unnecessary process that 's done entirely for the interests of some corporation that does n't have * our * interests ( the most important interest ) at heart and it ultimately does n't pay off . 
   islamisation well that did n't take long . 
  happiness now outlawed . 
   we 're not actually producing iron or gold , either , but they still have cost ... commodities not necessary to live . 
   water has cost because a ) it is a scarce resource b ) the process of providing it has cost . 
  maintaining the infrastructure requires resources ( both physical ones and human labour ) therefore it has cost . 
  so your solution is to put this scarce resource into the hands of people who 's *** sole interest *** is turning a profit ? 
  that does n't even mildly concern you ? 
   somebody has to pay the cost . 
  so your solution is to put it in the hands of profiteers ? 
   you just do n't get it . 
  yeah , i do n't get it . 
  i do n't get that we should n't put a resource which we need to live into the hands who 's *** sole entire existence is to turn profit *** . 
  something tells me i 'll * never * get the logic behind that one . 
   not everyone who disagrees with you is a paid shill or part of an organized downvote brigade . 
  um , i did n't say that ? 
  wtf ? 
  [ tupac aliv in serba ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_tdj-l84_8 ), 
  why does there need to be competition for a * post office * ? 
  and if it 's private why should we subsidize it ? 
  so we 're going to sell off our government service to someone who 's interest is entirely profit-motive , then we 're going to pay tax payer money * anyways * and then force tax payers to pay for the service itself , which will be more expensive than when it was government run . 
  makes no sense from a consumer perspective at all . 
  the eu is quite a neoliberal institution . 
  or rather it has many neoliberal stances . 
   sorry , i do n't follow . 
  do you mind elaborating ? 
  i think what he 's saying is that we ca n't actually attach a cost to water because we 're not actually producing it , we just have a monopoly on the distribution . 
  as for one of your earlier points ;  this is a false dichotomy and completely the wrong way to frame the problem . 
  water being a right means nobody can be actively denied access to it , not that access to it should be free this in of itself is a contradiction . 
  if i have to pay for something that means that i * can * be actively denied access to it . 
  what happens if i do n't pay ? 
  i get no water . 
  so as a * right * , i do n't have a * de facto * right to clean water , the most necessary building block of life . 
  everyone *** needs *** water , it 's one of those things that should * never * be monetized for profit . 
   i 've never seen any particularly strong anti euro-sceptic feelings here , but that 's probably because the actual matter of the eu is generally not what is discussed here . 
  you must 've missed election time lol, 
   it 's more for people in europe who like the eu . 
  not really , no . 
  there 's a lot of discussion here where you do n't have to like the eu to take part in it , and nobody is going to stop rational criticism of the eu . 
  given that the eu is one of the most powerful entities in the world , not to mention it 's a supranational federation that encompasses most of europe , i think that it is n't exactly a problem that it 's discussed nor do i think it 's over-represented in discussion . 
  it 's a big deal . 
  you say that , but racism and things of that nature are already regularly upvoted here . 
  ah well , if things get too bad i can just migrate to / r/europeans, 
  europeans can produce just as much bad quality as americans . 
  i love 11, 
  was n't attempting to deflect . 
  i 'm just saying , everyone 's got skeletons in their closet . 
  umm , no it 's not ... ... . isil 's success comes from political dissent in iraq from an incompetent government . 
  the vast majority of the territory it holds is desert and very large parts of the populations ran away . 
  isil is n't as big as you 're making it out to be , and while they wont simply be crushed and swept under the rug , they 're going to be relegated to another organization on par with al qaeda , or at the very worst case scenario , the taliban . 
  i 'm just going to save myself time and reply to your other comment as well . 
    you realize not every muslim believes the exact same things and that the interpretations are widely different ?
