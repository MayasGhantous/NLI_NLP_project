   actually , islam is very ... coherent , for lack of a better word . 
    it 's as racist to call muslims women haters as it is to say black people are criminals or lazy . 
   yeah well what i said is that `` there is a lot of minogyny '' in islam . 
  because there is . 
  the link above is one example . 
  but hey , it 's racist to imply communists have something against private ownership and nazis do n't like jews . 
  i mean , there are different interpretations and all people are different . 
  right ? 
  no , islam is not coherent at all . 
  if you want to compare it to other organized religion , it 's about as coherent as a church choir where every person is singing out of sync . 
  they 're all reading from the same hymn sheet but what comes out is entirely different . 
  there 's no church hierarchy and it has as many separate denominations as christianity itself , all with varying levels of extremism . 
  anyone can claim religious authority , so long as someone will listen to them . 
  i can not open up a church tomorrow and claim to be a catholic priest , however i could open a mosque and claim to by a sunni imam . 
  combine that with the extremely uneducated population , and that leaves a lot of room for muslims to start getting wildly different ideas on what things actually mean . 
  compound this with the fact such islamic pastors are viewed with massive amounts of respect , as my own country used to view catholic priests , people can be influenced to think whatever it is their religious authority desires them to . 
  you need only look at ireland 's development during the 20th century and you can see this happen , just with different names . 
  secondly , your comparison of muslims to communists in terms of how they viewed their respective `` enemies '' ( jews and nazis respectively ) ** does not match up ** . 
  i do n't doubt antisemitism is a real thing in north africa and arabian regions but it is politically charged , not religiously , where in a region where religion is a very strong identifier due to the weakness of the nation-state concept , jews can often be synonymous with israel . 
  in the western world , that does n't fly , and rightly so , but they mean two different things in two different places . 
  in contrast to the communist view on nazism , where they were two ideologically opposed forces , islam and judaism are not ideologically opposed at all and there 's nothing in either judaism or islam that dictates as such , except for ** highly ** contextual passages that applied to very specific situations . 
  the passage which you 've highlighted as misogyny is not widely practiced in a word for word fashion ; in reality , countries like egypt have massive divorce rates , and that 's a country with a population with very strong religious roots ; islam , like all religions , tends to get outmoded as society changes , and like all religions , they tend to adapt with the time . 
  one example i can give off the top of my head of a non-islamic country having religiously influenced draconian laws was that divorce was ** outlawed ** in ireland until 1996 , and that was because of the catholic church . 
  so , yeah , you can say islam was/is a misogynistic religion , but it is n't even ** close ** to unique in that regard , and the general populations are progressing at their own rate . 
  the problem for ** us ** is when descendants of immigrants to western countries grow up disadvantaged and then end up turning to extremism and reigniting these kinds of beliefs , and that in turn creates `` integration problems '' . 
  the problem is not islam in of itself , it is the socioeconomic status of people turning to its more fundamentalist aspects . 
  you 'll see the same thing in the us and christianity , poor/disadvantaged populations end up being very religious ( one of the things that has lead to the `` religious black people '' stereotype ) . 
  in conclusion ; 1 . 
  you are exaggerating isil 's influence . 
  right now it 's big because it capitalized on a volatile political situation , and extremists muslims use them as a rallying point . 
  not to mention their flag is very generic and can be used entirely independent of isil in of itself . 
  islam is not a coherent religion . 
  while the very fundamentals are largely agreed upon , there is a lot of variation , even within the same islamic denominations 3 . 
  combine this with the uneducated populations , and religion can be used as a tool of political influence , created religious extremists 4 . 
  antisemitism is real , but the cause and meaning is not exactly what we usually recognize it as 5 . 
  there is no inherent diametrical opposition between islam and judaism ( and by extension muslims and jews ) , excluding the opposiion that comes from the reality that they are two different religions 6 . 
  misogyny is real but hardly unique and not as widely practiced as one might think . 
  if one were to criticize islam on this , it would have to be a pretty universal condemnation of many religions , particularly the abrahamic ones . 
  turns to fundamentalist/extremist religion is a matter of socioeconomic status , not fundamental fact of belonging to that religion in the first place . 
  yes i 'm aware i went on a bit of a tangent, 
  says the guy who just outlined his three stage conspiracy theory of how muslims want to take over the world . 
  i 'm sure you made your effort to welcome them with open arms . 
  a history book written by pope urban ii ? 
  ah yes , if one considers that there 's more than just one factor - that factor being islam - they 're an `` apologist '' . 
  classical example of what this `` debate '' is . 
  people are so afraid of a critical analysis of their own country that they 'll move heaven and earth to make it look like it 's those dirty foreigners who refuse to do anything and wont integrate out of choice . 
  so you 're saying every muslims everywhere hates jews ? 
  a revolution ? 
  a coup or regime change ? 
  sure . 
  [ they a ` int the only ones ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_scare ), 
  thanks boss , i needed to go chillout . 
  your phrasing was fine , people are just being a bit uptight about it . 
  science do n't real , god said so, 
  so you 're saying the netherlands is a utopia with no poverty and no poor education , and i have to prove to you that it 's not . 
  despite what the politicians say , there is a very substantial population in the uk that enjoys being in the eu or at the very least admit to its myriad of benefits and would not want to leave . 
   i claim that relative to the rest of the world they are not . 
  they 're not living in the rest of the world . 
  they 're living in the netherlands and only the conditions in the netherlands are of any relevancy whatsoever . 
  again , are you claiming that the netherlands has zero poverty and zero poor education ? 
  i do n't think i could 've dumbed it down any further for you to understand it . 
  like , i do n't even know where the fuck you came up with your premise . 
  you genuinely pulled it out of your ass out of absolutely nowhere . 
  me : `` not all muslims believe the same thing '' you : `` so you 're saying that all muslims believe the same thing as x radical group !? '', 
  i do n't know where you learned to read , but i do n't need your `` help '' for anything and i most certainly do n't need a `` way out '' . 
   are you claiming the netherlands has a lot of poverty and poor education ? 
  are you claiming that they have no poverty or poor education ? 
  i was n't aware bin laden was born and raised in the netherlands . 
  i 'm not responding to anymore of your comments . 
  try reading first before responding . 
   ** you realize not every muslim believes the exact same things and that the interpretations are widely different ? 
  ** how the hell is this saying they all muslims the same thing ? 
  how is that even remotely implying that ? 
  i do n't really mind either way , it 's harmless . 
  pretty sure that 's a load of shit . 
  one person can cause a lot of trouble . 
  they 're a pretty small minority but american and alarmist media will never let that one slide . 
  got ta keep up the narrative of europe being swamped by barbaric muslims . 
  most of these people turn into radicals and extremists because they 're from poor or rundown areas and have poor education . 
  as good average life here is compared to elsewhere in the world , there are still very much the haves and have-nots , and the vast majority of the time these radicals come form the have-nots . 
   but what i meant to point out is that it 's not a case of `` isis 's black flags are flying in europe '' at all , like the article seems to suggest . 
  it 's an american publication , they 'll exaggerate it as much as possible to make it look like the muslims are out to commit holocaust 2.0 in israel, 
  [ this is what i think about these kinds of arguments ] ( https://fbcdn-photos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/t1.0-0/10517583_1456524347944908_3687506567247217305_n.jpg ), 
   now let 's say instead : `` he 's muslim , so he believes xyz '' . 
  in this case , the argument makes more sense because by definition , a muslim is a person who believes certain things . 
  you realize not every muslim believes the exact same things and that the interpretations are widely different ? 
  it 's not some organized religion like catholicism , there is no standard interpretation as laid out by the church , and there has n't been since the fall of the ottoman empire and dissolution of the caliphate ( which correlated with a marked rise in extremist islam , i might add ) . 
  it 's as racist to call muslims women haters as it is to say black people are criminals or lazy . 
  yeah man because this is an islamic practice, 
  i 'd imagine that those protesters at the hague are n't exactly mainstream , either . 
  the point he was making that `` i ca n't imagine this happening in the us '' was simply a false claim , it happens , it 's just fringe and nobody gives a fuck , in the same way these people here are fringe ( but we apparently do give a fuck ) . 
  this is an argument that is pointless to have here . 
  / r/europe is filled colonial apologists . 
   these are the stupid things you can expect when your moderators are part of the cabal that runs the defaults . 
  ** it 's an oligarchy man , they 're takin ' over **, 
  i 'm largely indifferent to this post 's existence , i just do n't see the point . 
  most of the people in / r/europe know the basics and are familiar with what 's what . 
  from what i understand this whole thing was spawned by a discussion about users hating mods for some reason , which makes the reception of this thread hilariously ironic . 
   unless it turns out they are all brainwashed bingo . 
  they 're brainwashed from birth to think they 're stopping a second holocaust .
