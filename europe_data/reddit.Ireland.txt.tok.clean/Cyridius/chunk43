  i ca n't really sum up a tl ; dr because there 's too much to the video , you should really watch it when you can . 
  because it 's world ** news ** , not world ** talksdonebyformeridfsoldiersthatarerelatedtocurrenteventsbutarentactuallynews **, 
  i 've just come to accept how fickle reddit is lol, 
  til europe is only the 28 member states of the eu , not the 22 other ones . 
  iranians are great for integration . 
  they 're a very progressive people . 
  [ after watching this i felt a significant degree of sympathy for the young men in the idf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93hqlmrzkd8 ) , it really just gets across how easy it is to fall into this trap where , no matter what you 're doing , your mind perceives it as * necessary * to protect yourself and your people . 
  this conflict is not a localized one . 
  it 's global . 
  it always has been . 
  and its continuation is a test of the very values we as human beings claim to hold . 
  no , that 's honky . 
  [ just asking questions , right ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beck_v._eiland-hall ), 
  given that ukraine has thousands of soviet era military vehicles lying around it would n't be surprising for the russian forces to pick them up and get them running again . 
  it 's not like all the military bases in the east held out . 
  not really making an argument here . 
  and then we can ignore all the cases where they aare let off with a slap on the wrists ? 
  how many of those prosecution ended with a conviction ? 
  you 're the best . 
  american soldiers are immune to the law everywhere . 
  ah , more typical israeli propaganda . 
  that 's not what hamas does , but keep drinking down the kool-aide . 
  it was to counter your points that dictatorship has historical precedent away from corporations . 
  yes , that 's true , but there 's a *** lot *** of precedent for corporations attempting to prop up regimes that are favourable to them , usually undemocratic or dictatorial ones , and this is done in order for a corporation to pursue even more wealth , and from there , power . 
  so when someone says to me , the answer to prevent corporate domination is a dictatorship , in reality a dictatorship is the most likely thing to come from corporate domination . 
  11 million euros , all of which has to pass through israel , go under israeli inspection , and get rejected or denied based on israeli judgement . 
  it 's a great gesture , but what the people of gaza need more than money , is a strong stance against israel , which france categorically will not take . 
  do n't assume he does n't agree with that . 
  this war is driven entirely by israel 's military industrial complex . 
  developing new weapons and methods , and testing it on the palestinian people before selling it world wide . 
  [ here 's a good talk from an israeli 's perspective ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93hqlmrzkd8 ), 
  yeah man , despite the fact hamas 's policy as a grassroots organization is to do things like provide services and care for the population . 
  they did n't get into power on a platform of destroying israel , they got in because they actually gave stuff that the people needed , like healthcare and food and other services . 
  if you need to look at their m.o. , take a look at the muslim brotherhood , of which hamas is a part of . 
  fallacy fallacy . 
  in history a dictatorship existed as a matter of securing power and wealth . 
  power and wealth are two things corporations endlessly pursue . 
  they 're in the eu , the eu has a set of rules , values , and ideals that it essentially enshrines . 
  fundamental ideas like freedom of press , speech , and democracy . 
  hungary is violating them . 
  a dictatorship is nothing more than the political manifestation of corporate interests . 
  dictatorship is rife across the third world and it 's not because the people there enjoy it . 
  said it before and i 'll say it again , there needs to be an official eu inquiry into the activities of the hungarian government in order to investigate their violation of european values . 
   `` democracy does n't have to be liberal , in hungary the democracy for the working class is coming . '', 
  yeah * right * , i 'd like to see that ultranationalist implement a worker 's republic . 
  not going to happen . 
  i do n't see this hang up on half black . 
  you ca n't be `` half black '' , it 's the colour of your fucking skin . 
  if obama was a pasty white american , he 'd be white . 
  not half-black . 
  those are both practically speaking , the same argument just rehashed , which was addressed [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2brtk0/racist_propaganda_posters_in_russias_perm_region/cj8aut6 ), 
  [ this conversation was had further down ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2brtk0/racist_propaganda_posters_in_russias_perm_region/cj89rzo ) conclusion ; this stance is bad, 
  lol k, 
  looks pretty black to me . 
  going from your deleted comments , you 're one of those `` words only mean something if you want them to ! '', 
  types . 
  that 's pretty fucking stupid . 
  if i called obama a nigger , that would be racist by pretty much everyone 's account . 
  but seeing as to you , nigger is just a word , it does n't matter unless people want it to matter . 
  does n't work like that . 
  words with deeply ingrained cultural use have a meaning whether you want them to or not and no amount of `` le edgy racism '' will change that . 
  secondly , you seem under the impression that there 's virtually ~ ~ one ~ ~ no difference between calling bush a monkey and obama a monkey . 
  the big difference is that obama is black so that calling him a monkey is a culturally ingrained insult which compares him to a species widely regarded as intellectually inferior in every capacity , not because he 's dumb all by himself , but because he 's black and according to racist `` wisdom '' , blacks are actually directly related to monkeys due to their looks . 
  so , no , calling bush a monkey is not the same as calling obama one . 
  the first one is an insult on intelligence , the second one is questioning his actual humanity . 
  there are a million different ways someone can get across obama being a moron if they wanted ; for example , they could 've used a donkey - it 's even the democratic party 's mascot , would 've worked * fine * . 
  but no , this poster is racially motivated no matter how much you want to excuse it . 
  `` half black '' lol, 
  i do n't think he was a neonazi ( not sure , was n't really interested in his ideology ) , but he was very strongly anti-muslim . 
  absolutely . 
  i find it shamefully ironic that so many feel the need to lump `` jews '' with `` israel '' , even if it is simply a subconscious connection , it needs to be fixed . 
  the more antisemitism solidifies and shows , the more justification exists for israel . 
   often visit white supremacist websites ? 
  they 're good for lols if you ever browse places like stormfront the people are so moronically stupid it 's like a caricature of reality . 
  could 've sworn i 've seen that picture ( sans russian ) on white supremacist websites . 
  [ well , it 's not new anyways ] ( http://images1.naharnet.com/images/92702/w460.png?1379178585 ), 
  are you really stupid enough to think those two situations are in any way equatable ? 
  no , the embassy here is insane . 
  [ here 's an interview with the ambassador ] ( http://www.newstalk.ie/ireland-criticised-for-failure-to-vote-on-uns-gaza-resolution ) choice excerpts ; `` the idf is the most moral army in the world '' `` the un human rights council could already have long ago changed its name to the un terrorist rights council '', 
  we have zero tolerance and heavily enforced drink driving laws here , and it still happens . 
  police ca n't be everywhere . 
  that just says everything , does n't it ? 
  here 's another one to sate your interests https://twitter.com/israelinireland/status/492032403716997120/photo/1, 
  you 'd think so , but it 's not rare for the israeli embassy to say stuff like this . 
  they have a pretty high tolerance for fuck ups if it 's the embassy interns . 
  this is the same guy who said we should rename the un human rights council to the un terrorist rights council . 
  this is the same guy who said we should rename the un human rights council to the un terrorist rights council . 
  it 's shockingly similar i suppose , the revolutionaries only surrendered because the brits were inflicting too many civilian casualties . 
  you should listen to the recent newstalk.ie interview with the ambassador ; http://www.newstalk.ie/ireland-criticised-for-failure-to-vote-on-uns-gaza-resolution scroll down to get to it . 
  this is the same guy who said we should rename the un human rights council to the un terrorist rights council . 
  given that there 's quite a significant crossover between the people that believe in that conspiracy and the people who hate jews , i 'm not sure i agree . 
  how can you claim that with any kind of legitimacy when all the cities in the east were held by separatists who would n't let anyone vote ? 
  why does nobody look at the name of the people they 're talking to ? 
  no , it was a coalition of the willing . 
  it only became nato forces when it died down into an insurgency . 
  afghanistan was nato all the way . 
  what 's the resemblance ? 
  it 's in the arab nature to hate and murder jews / s, 
  funny tidbit ; israel started as a group of jewish socialist commune and was initially part of the soviet bloc until the american money started flowing , and was a very leftist state up until the 80 's .
