   the ease under which redditors support `` palestine '' bothers me since it usually means that they are also `` anti-zionist '' ( in quotations because it usually means something else ) . 
  well it did n't take long for the ad-hominem strawman of `` if you do n't like zionism you hate jews '' to turn up, 
   i 'd have a ulster if i was them . 
  mate you can keep it . 
  the cost of not treating your workers like shit . 
  benefits , safety regulations , and so on . 
   that depends allot on how many regulation the gov will remove in order to decrease the costs of hiring people so your solution to the unemployment crisis is to treat employed people like shit ? 
  the only reason a voter does not know what is good for them is because they are denied information or manipulated . 
  the hague only goes after weak people that do n't have the backing of a major hegemonic power . 
  all russia need do is take him in and we wont get him at all , same thing happens with people on `` our side '' as well . 
   what a weird ~ ~ week ~ ~ year for aviation ... 
   why ca n't i turn your sentence around to you ? 
  you ca n't turn it around on me because it makes absolutely no sense to do so . 
  i 'm calling you out on your bullshit . 
   can you please bring on some arguments besides emotions and ad hominem , why the things that i post are bad ? 
  probably because all the sources are incredibly biased and you 're trying to massively spread a one sided view ? 
  spreading propaganda is bad and you know it . 
  you ca n't turn this around on me . 
  your *** entire *** post history is israel today , the daily jewish forward ( what you posted here ) , and other various sources of very strong pro-israel propaganda , or fear-mongering papers ( like this ) , or anti-muslim submissions . 
  you have a large negative comment karma for a reason and it 's because people recognize you 're full of shit the second you actually share an opinion . 
  almost your *** entire *** post history is literally pro-israel propaganda or anti-muslim/pro-christian crap . 
   let him get exp playing mayor as of now , which the kievans seemed to approve since they elected him mayor . 
  / r/outside, 
  but you ca n't discover that in the midst of civil war . 
  we saw what happened during the presidential elections . 
  people called assad 's elections a `` sham of democracy '' specifically for that reason . 
  how can we not say the same here ? 
  where did i bring up the wbc ? 
  they 're probably the most likely people to burn an american flag in anything . 
  you need to just stop what you 're doing . 
  you can ask any american and even they will tell you that americans are pretty fucking big on their flags . 
  there was nothing hypocritical in what i said . 
  if anything , if we were going by you , *** you *** would be the one using wbc to represent the usa . 
  yeah man , the crazy people in belfast can be extrapolated to represent the 507 million people in the eu . 
  you 're such a tryhard man . 
  every time something that can be even remotely construed as even mildly `` anti-american '' ( lol ) you come out of the woodworks . 
  just stop . 
  thanks haha the whole point of me applying was to see if i could improve the quality of the sub . 
  if the current mod team did n't think i was fit for it then i can only assume that they made the right call !, 
  how are you sure the media is reflecting the population as opposed to the population reflecting the media . 
  that 's generally how it happens ; people get their information from media outlets . 
  if media is so heavily beating the war drums and falling behind the government official stances without criticism , then the population will fall in line with what the media is telling them . 
  media freedom is about more than laws . 
  it 's about atmosphere and intimidation . 
  if you can legally say anything you want but are relentlessly attacked , intimidated , and so on and so forth , that is not free media enviornment , it 's a suppressed media enviornment . 
  allow me to correct ; * some * people will care , but they 're just too idiotic ( i 'm not sure idiotic is the right word - nationalist maybe ) to realize that those people who just run around and can only express themselves with shit like this are usually fringe and generally crazy fucks ( again , not sure if `` crazy fucks '' is the proper term here , it 's hard to explain ) . 
  and i do n't consider it too much in bad taste . 
  sports and politics have always been intrinsically linked no matter if we want them to be or not . 
  like every time the ussr and usa faced off in a sport . 
  regardless of that though , i always consider physical violence an absolutely no-no when those involved have nothing to do with it . 
  the daily mail is such good journalism . 
  i read the israeli news and the only one i 've ** ever ** seen go against the grain is ha'aretz, 
  here we 're not so crazy when it comes to flags . 
  nobody cares if you burn or deface one , in america you can get the shit kicked into you for hanging it upside down . 
  and i 'm not exaggerating when i say that . 
  more soldiers than police, 
  i agree , but that distinction generally does n't matter to people in favour . 
  he 's saying that playing the game is pointless if it 's rigged against you from the start . 
  if virtually nobody you vote for follows through on their promise , it represents a failure in the state . 
  the reality is that this ukrainian government is not really that different from the old one . 
  i do n't really care about the cp being banned , they were a load of corrupt pricks , but what i do n't understand is why organizations such as right sector can still run around . 
  it wont happen, 
  [ nobody will use nukes in an armed engagement .

  there is such a colossal amount of bullshit , ignorance , propaganda , willful ignorance , bias , incapability to read , hypocrisy , and just general lack of knowledge on your part that i refuse to continue this conversation . 
  i have already refuted all your point here , you 've not read them , i 'm not going to respond to someone who is not going to hold up his side of the conversation . 
   learn the history . 
  do n't tell * me * to learn the history , i 'm far more informed on this topic than you are . 
   i am in no way defending israels war crimes , but you are defending hamas 's . 
  yes you absolutely are . 
  claiming that both sides hold equal responsibility despite the fact that there is one obvious , clear , blatant aggressor is apologism . 
  you are blatantly defending israel 's crimes . 
   the whole reason this started was the kidnapping and killing of three jews , and the retaliatory kidnapping and arson attack on a palestinian . 
   then hamas launched rockets , and that culminated in what we see now . 
   tl : dr its tit for tat , both sides are at fault , stop being so ignorant of the past . 
  that 's not what happened at all and the fact that * you * are calling me ignorant is a hilariously ironic statement . 
  i try to keep my cool with people like you , but seriously , try and at least fucking read about what you 're talking about before spewing baseless bullshit . 
  let 's break down the shit you just said . 
   the whole reason this started was the kidnapping and killing of three jews , and the retaliatory kidnapping and arson attack on a palestinian . 
  firstly , no , that is not the `` whole reason '' . 
  again , fucking ignorant . 
  at least you got the kidnapping and murdering shit right . 
  but still , i love how you like to sanitize it by calling it an `` arson attack '' . 
  they fucking burned him alive . 
  both acts are criminal and condemnable . 
  yes , they were * criminal * and required a * criminal investigation * , not an * act of war * as israel used it as . 
   then hamas launched rockets , and that culminated in what we see now . 
  absolutely not . 
  in the search for the kidnapped kids , israel encroached on palestinian territory , * kidnapped * several * hundred * palestinians , many of which were * top hamas leaders * . 
  and they still hold them in detention camps without charge . 
  still no rockets from hamas . 
  there were rockets , but hamas claims responsibility for each and every one of its rockets , and during this period they were dead silent except to * deny all involvement in the kidnapping * . 
  repeatedly . 
  but according to the israeli government , `` hamas will pay '' , facts be damned . 
  then after the boys are found dead , israel ramps up the war rhetoric , blaming hamas with absolutely zero evidence , while hamas continues to deny all involvement . 
  then israel bombs the fuck out of gaza , * then * hamas fires rockets and claims responsibility . 
  the * reality * , not the biased one sided bullshit , is that netanyahu used the kidnap and murder of three israeli children as a pretext to launch a criminal war in gaza with the intent to eliminate his political opponents , hamas , and to pave the way for the expansion of settlements in the west bank due to the break down in relations meaning israel no longer had to restrain itself in its ethnic cleansing of the palestinians . 
   tl : dr its tit for tat , both sides are at fault , stop being so ignorant of the past . 
  oh , an `` tit for tat '' implies equality . 
  there is absolutely nothing equal about this conflict , it 's one nation instigating conflict on another in order to expand its colonial agenda in the region .
