  the more you pay them , the better conditions they work in , the more regulations there are , the more expensive it is , and then it stops being cheap . 
  workers in china or bangladesh etc. 
  are not treated well , because companies go there to get * cheap labour * and because the people there are poor and uneducated , they can treat them like shit in order to keep labour costs down . 
  you absolutely can not have one without the other . 
   your hypocrisy disgusts me . 
  in the same breath that you attack cheap labor , you defend buying your shitty iphone and other of the stuff you apparently cant live without `` because you 're a consumer so its not your fault '' . 
  i do n't force any companies to treat their workers like shit . 
  i want something , i will buy it . 
  it 's not under my control to decide how it gets to me and to say it 's my fault that chinese workers are treated like shit is nothing short of corporate apologism . 
   either you support cheap labor , or you dont . 
  lol because black and white views are * so * informed and nuanced . 
   if you buy cheap durable goods from china , you might as well buy them from africa and then also save on the emissions from transportation . 
  i would rather buy shit from countries where workers are n't exploited . 
  but that country does n't exist . 
   but apparently you just dont want black people to have access to jobs . 
  lol so , if you ca n't read or think , is your capability of discussion limited to oppressing africans and strawman statements ? 
  i would love for africans to be employed . 
  but you 're said and deluded to think that slave labour is `` providing jobs '' , it 's fucking cheap slave labour so we can get cheap commodities , and you support it if you insist on its propagation . 
  my stance is not even remotely difficult to grasp , and i do n't know where you 're getting 90 % of your comments from . 
  so sry i no commie no mor pls forgiv kill moslem pls, 
  and the sky is n't blue . 
  how many white muslims are in france , again ? 
  i do n't need to equate islam with arab , it 's synonymous when it comes to racists . 
   he was saying quite the opposite - that 's not okay for muslims to come to europe and treat everyone else as subhuman filth . 
  yeah , man , calling muslims parasites ( as he 's done before ) is *** definitely *** not in any way racist !, 
  i like your style !, 
  then again , you 're no stranger to spewing racist bullshit . 
   your defence of their actions is as disgusting as the actions themselves and this is your same defense as last time you got called out for being racist - `` how dare you accuse me of being racist it 's not racist if it 's true it 's just realism fuck how can you defend these pieces of garbage to endorse rape and murder you 're disgusting ''  and it 's the fact that they can rely on someone like you appearing in every discussion trying to shut down any debate or condemnation by screaming `` racist ! '', 
  over and over , that they get away with it and feel like they can pull this sort of shit with impunity . 
  no , sorry , i 'm going to call racism on racist bullshit . 
  has it occurred to you that people can discuss problems about minorities without being racist fucks ? 
  i do n't think it has . 
  and yours is / pol / worthy, 
  i shout racism at racists . 
  you can deny you 're racist all you want but that does n't change the reality that you 're a fucking racist , and all the downvotes in the world does n't stop you from being a piece of shit . 
   we wouldnt assume sovereignty of the land , just rent it . 
  it wouldnt be slavery if people are free to move there and move away . 
  your logic is that africans come to these little patches of rented land because there 's no jobs in africa . 
  so if we treat them like shit , they 're stuck there with nowhere else to go . 
  that 's effective slavery . 
  you do n't blame someone for getting a job that 's going to treat them like shit when they need it to survive , you blame the employers for treating them like shit . 
   besides there would be ngo oversight . 
  and that does n't mean anything . 
  again , how do you think labour is cheap ? 
  it 's because workers are treated like shit . 
  if you want ngos with worker care and health being their priority , you do n't get cheap labour . 
  it 's one or the other . 
   and great double standard you have there , if you 've ever bought anything made in china or se asia then you have supported `` slavery '' too . 
  it is n't a double standard at all to buy these products ; we 're consumers , we ca n't decide where our stuff is made . 
  it * is * a double standard to be against one practice and supporting the other , and i am categorically against the treatment of workers in china etc. 
  no it is n't at all . 
  it 's a baseless , ignorant , generalizing , stereotyped accusation . 
  `` race realism '' is still racism , and i do n't see how someone from hungary has sufficient experience with muslims to even begin to make that kind of statement . 
  i a ` int complaining about the downvotes themselves as much as i am about the opinion they represent - that it 's ok to treat muslims like subhuman filth , which is what he 's advocating . 
  karma is not an issue , i 've got it in spades that i can take these downvotes 100x over and still have more to spare . 
  the point i was making is that if white people ( because you can i both know he 's talking about arabs , let 's not pussyfoot around this ) were looting it would just be another standard case of criminals taking advantage of disorder . 
  but no , if it 's arabs it 's some sort of crime against humanity and they should be deported or filth or whatever the fuck it is . 
  you 'll *** never *** see his reaction to `` europeans '' doing the same thing . 
  grenshen so smart pls educat me i dno how live farage pls, 
  how do you think labour is cheap ? 
  these people would become effective slaves and it would be a restart of colonialism . 
  i would rather an epidemic of homeless foreigners than to sponsor slave camps so i can get cheaper iphones . 
  nationalism is a bigger cancer on this content than any amount of muslims , but * race realists * ( because they ca n't be racists obviously ) do n't get that . 
  lol ur so smart pls educat me, 
  every country has gone through that stage . 
  as people get more educated , the birth rates decrease . 
  probably just a load of tards from / pol / downvoting everything as they usually do . 
  10/10 title would editorialize again, 
  no , only if you 're an ignorant moron that knows nothing about islam to start with . 
  brown people sure are scary !, 
  yeah , because universal human rights are an elite thing , despite the fact they 're * universal * . 
  human rights exist for a reason . 
  they 're not some fancy-ass abstract invention made up one day by some old guys a few centuries ago . 
  they 're created on the basis of centuries of thought , human experience and historical precedent . 
  that 's true , but there 's that , and then not giving a fuck about who else they hit as long as they get the guy they want . 
  got ta love another round of racism from our resident islamaphobe edit : you can keep downvoting me but you ca n't ignore reality . 
  his post history ? 
  loaded with racist bullshit . 
  his comment ? 
  if you `` race realists '' want to ignore the fact that you 're pieces of shit , fine by me . 
  got ta love that casual racism . 
  so , where 's your massive indignant outrage when white people do this ? 
  or is it just that the sand niggers are n't people to start with ? 
  edit : so the downvotes are telling me that white people have never looted anything before ? 
  damn , i need to brush up on my history to be sure about this . 
  got ta love casual racism . 
  got ta love casual racism . 
  edit : so , did you forget to switch accounts or something ? 
  got ta love casual racism . 
  edit : dae brown people are n't europeans guys ? 
  you 've said that before , and yet you still have n't told me whether or not you know each and every one of these people personally . 
  do you ? 
  or is it just more of your anti-islamic rhetoric ? 
  funny how you did n't mention all the shia ethnic cleansing and massacres by isil , which is far more prevailant than any crimes against christians . 
  edit : great show guys , downvote me for calling someone out on his continuous bullshit . 
  maybe all of you know the protesters personally and can tell me whether or not they protested against boko haram ? 
  or maybe you can explain to me why it only matters when christians are getting killed by isil ? 
  there are a tonne of europeans . 
  i do n't see why people like you need to bring your xenophobia into everything . 
  edit : dae think if someone is not my colour or religion they ca n't be european !,
