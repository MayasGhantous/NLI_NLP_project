  `` god damn jews , free palestine '' \\* grabs air jordans *, 
  so israel is a terrorist state ? 
  or is it only terrorism when muslims do it ? 
  it 's not even that israel just bombs densely populated areas ( where are the people going to go , anyways ? 
  ) , it 's that they use munitions that are expressly going to kill a lot of civilians . 
  white phosphorus , cluster bombs , flechette canisters from their tanks , artillery , naval bombardment - there is absolutely zero finesse to their operations , where surgical precision is required . 
   it does n't matter what show of good faith israel delivers on , because hamas will continue firing rockets regardless . 
  yeah - no . 
  hamas did n't fire any rockets until israel attacked them . 
  hamas claims responsibility for each and every one of their rockets fired into israel , and all those rockets going into israel before their bombing campaign ? 
  hamas denied all involvement . 
  in fact , if we 're going by the israeli account of things , hamas has for * years * been trying extremely hard to preserve the peace with israel and stop rockets being fired from gaza into israel . 
  of course , hamas is still the bad guy when israel unilaterally invades palestinian territory , kidnaps several hundred hamas members , and then starts a bombing campaign . 
  israel used the murder of those israeli kids as a pretext to launch an invasion with the excuse that hamas was behind those murders , despite absolute denial . 
  and under the cover of this conflict , israel can now restart their policy of ~ ~ settlement ~ ~ ethnic cleansing of the west bank . 
  the settlement policy is just polished up version of ethnic cleansing , and everyone knows it . 
  those who decide to settle in the west bank do so with the full knowledge that they are displacing people living there , expelling them from their own land and leaving them with nothing . 
  you need to be pretty fucked in the head to be ok with that in the first place , so it comes as no surprise that the settlers view the palestinians as little more than rodents . 
  it 's funny because alan shatter did a total 180 on our policy towards israel , even proclaiming ireland `` a friend of israel '' and so on and so forth . 
  nothing to do with him being jewish . 
  it 's that kind of imbecilic action from people that has lead to this conflict in the first place , imo, 
  fighting an occupational force is terrorism now ? 
  oh , right , yeah , it 's only terrorism when we do n't do it . 
  nope . 
  the loyalists just tend to like the opposite of whatever the nationalists like up north . 
  i 'm sure you know each and every individual there personally . 
  yeah , and [ israel is fascist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjw8u0ach4q&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=37s ) we can cherry pick things all day . 
  except nobody knows ireland as `` republic of leinster '' - holland has been the passing term for the country since i was a little kid . 
  yes . 
  but that 's different - politically - to say , al qaeda killing 2000 people and the usa killing 2000 people . 
  they both have the same cost of life , but the first one is not a state actor , it 's a paramilitary organization and as such has no civilian accountability . 
  i dunno , maybe because calling slavoj \u017di\u017eek a `` contrarian leftist '' is like calling noam chomsky a `` contrarian linguist '' or piketty `` a contrarian statistician '' . 
  have you considered , possibly , that just because it does not align exactly to what you think does not make the article `` contrarian '' or `` unsubstantiated '' ? 
  i would love to see all these unsubstantiated claims , because this article is literally saying what everyone already knows ; money talks in politics, 
  and what exactly do you base your statements on ? 
  i also find it hilarious that you use `` contrarian leftists '' as some kind of insult . 
  how dare people think differently to what i do !!!!, 
  i 'm sure we can all simply relegate slavoj \u017di\u017eek to the post of `` contrarian leftist '' . 
  just lol, 
  they 're all equally condemnable but they 're not the same thing . 
  no , i think unaccountable organizations are entirely different to state actors , as anyone with common sense would . 
  oh yeah , because that 's entirely the exact same thing . 
  i 'm sure he 's scared . 
  what does europe 's ire look like , again ? 
  a few months considering sanctions ? 
  israel seems to enjoy conflating the two . 
  it 's funny because most of the hardcore ultranationalist zionists are western immigrants . 
  you see the jews calling for palestinian blood at a protest in tel aviv ? 
  thick american accents . 
  poor bastard hahaha better luck next time . 
  i think i 'm just going to block you . 
  you are not interested in discussion . 
  i 'm not sure what standard procedure is in this kind of situation , but given the rebels ' previous treatment of the dead i doubt it 's exactly a good thing . 
  rt is shit at what it does . 
  rfe/rl has had 70 years to practice what they 're doing . 
  they have better writing quality , better journalism , and that 's the best kind of propaganda - the kind that convinces you that it 's legitimate and that those * other guys * are propaganda . 
  rfe/rl was funded by the *** cia *** , people . 
  it does n't get much more obvious than that . 
  now it 's funded by the us federal government . 
  it a ` int a complicated chain . 
  pointing to rt and saying `` well those guys are really fucking obvious so that 's why rfe/rl is cool '' ... does n't make sense . 
  except those are state news media . 
  rfe/rl is not state media , it 's independent media based in europe that reports on europe . 
  except it has a history of being funded by the cia and then the us federal government . 
  it is n't even in the remotely same league as the bbc , cbc , rt\u00c9 , npr etc. 
  the best propaganda is the kind that convinces you it is n't even propaganda . 
  rfe/rl has good writing and is subtle about what it does , but it *** is *** a propaganda network nonetheless . 
  yeah , they were avoiding a thunder storm . 
  a pilot decision . 
  what of it ? 
  holland is the broad colloquial use and is easier and quicker to type . 
  the ukrainian government is about as trustworthy as the russian one . 
  they 're our buddies for now but let 's not forget both countries are run in very , very similar manners . 
  if we give weapons to them , a few bribes down the line they 'll end up somewhere we do n't want them . 
  seriously , i may have missed something , but since the first big round of sanctions a few months ago , have we actually done anything else ? 
   eu does n't differentiate between lives of ukrainians and its own citizens . 
  that is it does n't give a shit about either . 
  that 's a novel way of putting it . 
  the netherlands , uk or france might be able to invoke the relevant nato articles , but wont . 
  dude that 's like totally uncalled for . 
  like you do n't know the longterm psychological impact the famine has had on our national psyche . 
  it was a seminal era in irish history that laid the foundations for our very freedom . 
  taking pot shots at us for the famine is a dramatically disproportionate response and i 'm asking for - no , * demand * - an apology for this totally unprovoked disrespect of irish culture and heritage . 
  he did n't respond , huh ? 
  those french sure give up easily . 
  historical ties possibly, 
  el salvador is finally more relevant than ireland . 
  yeah right , as if the elections are legitimate . 
  russians are as much victims of putin as the rest of us are . 
  russians are no more responsible for what 's going on in ukraine than the americans are for iraq or the israelis are for palestine . 
  we 're all pawns on the chessboard and our governments are the players . 
  we should be uniting together against this war not attacking eachother over implicit support . 
  do we really want to find out ? 
  i think our opinion has been one sided here , though understandably . 
  firstly , i do n't believe the incident was intentional . 
  that 's not consolation to the families , clearly , but there 's more than just the families to consider here . 
  we have governments that exist to be emotionally detached from the situation . 
  so , in the context of this likely being an accident , responding with immediate hostility is not the best idea . 
  secondly , and i know people hate this being brought up , but a significant portion of the blame lies also on malaysia airlines . 
  this is , to me , at the very minimum a charge for gross negligence on the part of the airline , who decided to fly a passenger aircraft over what everybody knew was a combat zone when planes were getting shot down there on the regular basis .
