  in practical terms there 's very little difference between socialists and communists . 
   but this video is biased and twisted in many ways to make it seem like the government are dumber than the train . 
  opposition parties tend to do that !, 
  yeah , i 'm a rabid antisemite , let 's just ignore that i said antisemitism was a problem and needed to be stamped out [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2aw2r8/antwerp_rally_calls_for_slaughter_of_jews/cizly6v ) , [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2awjyy/belgium_shop_owner_refuses_to_sell_to_jews/cizlfwn?context=3 ) , and [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2awjyy/belgium_shop_owner_refuses_to_sell_to_jews/cizl4cu?context=3 ) . 
  people like you fucking disgust me , and before you play that shameful antisemite card , i mean you , individually , as a human being . 
  you should go to / r/israel because that 's where people like you i.e. 
  manipulative pieces of shit that spam pro-israel propaganda , belong . 
  and it 's not even that you 're just pro-israel , you 're blatantly anti-muslim . 
  as if that 's a fucking surprise . 
  and , see , if this `` information '' ( you mean propaganda ? ), 
  was in any way remotely true , i might actually agree that you should post it here . 
  but , no , it 's propaganda . 
  and socialist brigades ? 
  lol every time people disagree with me it 's a brigade , it 's surely not because i 'm an ignorant dumbfuck , no sir !, 
  keep trying the play `` what do you mean * you people * !? '', 
  card and see how far it actually gets you in a conversation where someone is legitimately challenging you . 
  the answer is `` not far '' . 
  you belong in whatever circlejerk shithole that suits 1-day old not-new-accounts like you . 
  and here we go with the `` if you 're against israel you 're an antisemite '' bullshit . 
  you know , that 's just fucking offensive the actual victims of antisemitism and you should be embarrassed . 
  ohhh , i 'm so hurt . 
  tell you what , if you promise to keep all your israeli propaganda and bullshit on / r/israel where you belong , i 'll keep all my socialist shit on / r/socialism, 
  says you . 
  for people unaware , v\u00e4nsterpartiet ( or `` left party '' ) is a left wing socialist party , so you can see the context in which the video is being made . 
  it 's pretty accurate , so , no defamation . 
  no it is n't . 
  i 'm just gon na tag you and end this discussion . 
  you 're clearly a troll and a xenophobe . 
  tell le pen i said hello . 
  you just ignored what i just said to you . 
  coptic = organized religion which church and pope islam = disorganized grassroots religion with no church, 
  it 's based on a poor study , which [ has been discussed here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2aw2r8/antwerp_rally_calls_for_slaughter_of_jews/cizrzxf ) . 
  there 's quite a few different estimates , from as low as 10 to as high as 26 . 
  due to belgium 's laws , it is not easy to calculate . 
  your claim was entirely founded on the basis that there 's no antisemitism from the coptic church 's clerics but there was from imams . 
  i solidly refuted the logic behind your statement . 
  i do n't need to go any further . 
  if you 're just going to call everything that 's against israel antisemitism then i 'm not going to bother having this discussion . 
  that seems to be the criteria you 're going for . 
  if you 're going to go on some people calling for bad things to happen to some jews somewhere as a definition of widespread antisemitism , then europe has a very pervasive problem with antisemitism . 
  and your ignorance of islam is showing . 
  unlike coptic clerics , imams hold no general authority . 
  islam has no church . 
  it 's a disorganized religion . 
  anyone can call themselves an imam or cleric . 
  egypt has only very recently introduced a law which was trying to bring islam under state control that required imam 's to be registered and approved by the government . 
  so , yeah , i 'm sure there are dozens of `` authoritative '' imams calling for jew blood . 
  it is n't fear mongering , it 's realistic . 
  germany has always taken a very pragmatic approach towards russia . 
  i 'm sure germany stands with europe , but does it stand unreservedly with ukraine ? 
  i doubt that . 
  diplomacy is n't frowned upon , it 's just not working in this situation . 
  all during germany 's diplomatic efforts , russia and ukraine have both consistently been escalating the conflict , there 's been no improvement . 
  and if germany wants to impose sanctions , it can do that any time it wants . 
  they do n't need to wait for italy to do it , though obviously we 're all stronger together . 
  do n't take him on his word . 
  when it comes to anything muslim he 's about as reliable as hitler talking about the jews . 
  it is n't . 
  his claims are entirely unsubstantiated . 
  mcctaggart is infamously full of shit when it comes to anything to do with muslims . 
  i would n't worry about him . 
  yes , those people . 
  yes , there is a serious problem with muslims and antisemitism , i 've said as much elsewhere . 
  however , it is unsurprising the elchardus drew a lawsuit given that he was linking islam , the religion , with antisemitism , which simply is not an accurate sentiment . 
  many muslims are antisemites , but it is not a muslim practice . 
  it 's a cultural thing , not a religious one . 
  for example , coptic christians in egypt would also have a large number of antisemites . 
  there is very much a fine line between what you can and can not say without liability , and there is a point where you simply can not claim you 're a victim when you 're making such statements . 
  is of easy soviet ingenuity , comrade . 
  an international brigade , you say ? 
  yeah but they were preexisting members . 
  i think it 's a barrier to joining , not a clause that must be constantly maintained . 
  which makes sense . 
  no , germany has a pragmatic stance . 
  if it can find a way out without massively losing face , it will . 
  if it can arbitrate between both sides and allow itself to be friendly with both , it will . 
  if push comes to shove , nobody actually knows where germany will stand . 
  why would we want to encourage that thought ? 
  if we just let this shit slide it becomes an `` ok '' opinion to hold and it just creates a society of division with an atmosphere of hate . 
  i do n't think someone should have the right to deny service based on irrational racial or religious hatreds . 
   oh please these people are always on the fringe on legality and constantly battling in court cases . 
  maybe they should n't talk so much shit and people would have less excuse to bring them to court . 
  one would think that you , a person so strong in defending free speech , would at least want that speech to be accurate and informative when it 's politically motivated . 
   hardly ever happens . 
  no one from this rally is going to get arrested , i guarantee it . 
  this is assuming it even * happened * , as they 're describing it . 
  remember what website is reporting this - and remember that nobody else has picked up on this . 
  i 'd rather not take haaretz at its word , it 's less reliable than rt. 
   and beyond this , the media wo n't even pay any attention to this protest . 
  mainstream european newspapers runsconstant editorials on the dangers of the ukip/fn / ... but you wo n't see a single mention anytime of this story or the dangers of rising anti-semitism in europe by muslim immigrants . 
  ... and that has nothing to do with the main point . 
  you 're complaining that the news is n't banging on and advocating your anti-immigrant agenda 24/7 ? 
  sorry , there are far more important people to talk about than ukip , which does n't even hold any seats in national parliament and is famous for doing absolutely fuck all but leech taxpayer money . 
  fn is pretty much only relevant to france , especially after le pen 's failure to form an eu group - not to mention they hold only 1/4 of the seats and far , far less on the national level . 
  again , not a very relevant party in order to warrant constant news coverage . 
  believe it or not , the anti-immigration agenda is not all that pervasive in europe . 
  haaretz , such impartiality !, 
  and what a surprise !, 
  posted by a day old account !, 
  edit : and i 'm editing because i saw your comment and your downvote ;  are you trying to say something ?
