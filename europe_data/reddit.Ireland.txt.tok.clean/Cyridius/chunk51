  yeah , i am trying to say something . 
  i 'm saying it 's not surprising that a poster to / r/israel who 's post history is filled with pro-israel bullshit and is posting haaretz as a legitimate source ( haaretz is less fucking reliable than rt ) is probably the most obvious not-new-account i 've seen in weeks . 
  due to the historical context , muslims are n't terribly fond of jews . 
  it is n't right and should be stamped out . 
  i have a westernized , highly educated , high skilled muslim father , but he 's still an antisemite . 
  it 's some sort of weird cultural fuckery . 
  but then again , europeans are n't so different when it comes to certain religious or ethnic groups ... 
  why do you people need to lie all the time ? 
  all i ever see ; lies , lies , lies . 
  why ca n't you make a point without lying ? 
  criticizing immigration : *** protected *** speech - hence why people like marine le pen and nigel farage are walking free , despite all their lies . 
  call of violence against a specific group : *** unprotected *** speech and people get locked up for it all the time . 
  i nearly would n't mind the anti-immigration bullshit people spew if it was n't so fucking stupid and loaded with lies . 
  oh yeah i know that ; there 's a lot about american presence i do n't like , but i mean in this context ( hurr durr us should stay out of european affairs ), 
  i would laugh if they said it was ukrainian territory and redrew all their maps to make it so . 
  oh , it 'll be enough , but russia will veto everything and china is not going to go to bat for ukraine . 
  no , if east ukraine is still declaring itself independent , it creates similar issues to crimea . 
  ukraine would never give up crimea anyways , it 'll be the next kosovo in that russia 's allies will recognize its control over the region and ukraine 's allies wont . 
  america 's the only country going to bat for ukraine ; and people here talk of them like they 're some sort of parasite or nuisance . 
  yeah , and the cubans living in florida are going to speak of castro 's government fairly . 
  if the e.u. 
  stated that all servers were subject to its law , would then say yes that we would have jurisdiction over all servers . 
  one of the main points of storing data abroad is to avoid government efforts to secure information - like the us gov. 
  now even * our * data , as * european * citizens , is not safe on * our * servers because * america unilaterally said so * ? 
  fuck that shit . 
  america 's law is not global . 
  i am not an american citizen . 
  these companies are doing nothing in america . 
  if the usa wants to try and impose its laws in europe , the government can get fucked . 
  no , i do n't believe returning a region to its old colonial overlords is going to fix anything . 
  if anything similar were to happen , it should be made an international mandate , governed by the u.n. - as was the original plan for jerusalem . 
  much ussr propaganda was very similar . 
  it was very anti-nato anti-war . 
  or at least * something * more productive . 
  yeah man , what a fucking coward . 
  who would n't have the balls to get themselves kidnapped by the cia and taken away forever ? 
  massive entertainment got bought out by ubisoft , so there probably wont be another one . 
  oh absolutely . 
  if there was ever legislation that infringed on worker 's rights , i 'd be absolutely against it . 
  i suppose it 's very much a wait and see situation in this regard , because we do n't know anything about what he 's trying to do or the specifics of it . 
  slovenia was part of yugoslavia , which was n't part of the ussr bloc . 
  it pursued much different socialist policies which would in turn have a far more different effect to that of other communist bloc countries . 
  slovenia has also always been historically developed so it 's benefited from that . 
  do n't try to argue this here , it does n't work . 
  but really most countries are artificial constructs of one thing or another ; i do n't consider them illegitimate as a result . 
  democracy works ; but this is n't democracy, 
  [ only slightly related , but i always loved world in conflict 's juxtaposition between propaganda and reality ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbpmvburuaw ), 
  god dammit croatia , stop being more progressive than us !, 
  it 's crazy that how , in relation to our cost of living , our minimum wage is quite * decent * , yet somehow nobody can ever fucking afford anything . 
  and fine gael youth 's `` genius '' idea was to * lower * it . 
  either the studies and stats i 'm getting are *** all *** bolloxed or every irish person on the minimum wage ca n't manage finances . 
  there needs to be an increase in the minimum wage and that scam bridge bullshit needs to get scrapped/fixed . 
  the uk already has a minimum wage . 
  what the fuck is there to opt out of ? 
  because the nordic countries are a perfect utopia and every single country on the planet has absolutely nothing that will ever be better than a nordic country and that nordic countries and people are literally infallible . 
  jesus , i knew ignorant morons that lived outside of the area thought that , but i never thought that was an opinion held by people that lived there . 
  yeah , i 'm sure `` continental europeans '' ( whatever the fuck that means ) do n't understand , even though germany uses ( used ? ), 
  the exact same model yet they introduced a minimum wage . 
  where did you get that idea from ? 
  try being anywhere else on reddit and not being an american . 
  you get told how fucking amazing the us is , and the second you disagree it 's an `` anti-american circlejerk '' . 
  similar ? 
  maybe . 
  worse ? 
  you 're kidding me . 
  hey , if there 's no state , there 's no regulations so you do n't need to buy anyone off to avoid them !, 
  corruption = fixed . 
  economics does n't occur in a vacuum , if the us is benefiting more from this deal than us , that will boost their growth quicker than ours and cause problems in the long run . 
  neither do i. 
  oh in terms of writing quality rfe/rl is better . 
  but the best kind of propaganda is the kind the gives an illusion of legitimacy . 
  rt is by far , more blatant and stupid . 
  rfe/rl is more subtle and clever . 
  well , it is a propaganda website . 
  but the last time it was called out on it everyone got downvoted and attacked for being pro-russian . 
  this site is funded by the us federal government and formerly the cia , simple as that . 
  i rate it as reliable as rt. 
  but hey , because it shows russia negatively ( big surprise ) , nobody cares . 
  those things were more features of the entire cold war era as opposed to the soviet union in particular . 
  belarus is n't ? 
  so would any rational human being . 
  if there was any organization today worth viewing both with extreme disgust and extreme fear , it is the cia . 
  they 're essentially our version of terrorists . 
  they told me i could be anything ... 
  man , you guys over there in ukraine are really progressive and setting the standard for european values !, 
  i think hamas are part of the elected government of palestine and that if israel wants them to stop throwing rockets at them they should stop warmongering and negotiate . 
  but that 's just the voice of reason and logic talking , who cares about that ? 
  or the french . 
   palestine is simply a geographic region , that 's it . 
  how the fuck do you think states are made ? 
  palestine has been a region with a distinct and different population moving for independence since * ottoman * times . 
   saying that israel is occupying something is incorrect it simply is n't . 
  it is not incorrect . 
  it absolutely is not . 
  in any way , shape or form , is that incorrect . 
  even using your dumb argument , the modern , existing palestinian state is occupied by israel in the west bank . 
   let 's ignore the fact that gaza is run by hamas , a terrorist organisation , and israel is constantly being bombed from there . 
  so , would you feel about a russian occupation of lithuania ? 
  sounds like a good idea to me . 
  better not fight back , you terrorist .
