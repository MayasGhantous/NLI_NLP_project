  the idea of a `` terrorist organization '' is hilarious when it 's just a synonym for `` organization fighting against my geopolitical interests '' . 
  there is such a thing as christian communism !, 
  regardless , securing rights for oneself is one in the same as securing rights for everybody . 
  socialism is about securing democracy and worker 's rights in order to empower the common people to make decisions that effect them and their community . 
  given the nature of this community and the ethos on which it runs , socialist iconography such as the typical ch\u00e9 , or the hammer and sickle or the anarchism icon ( which is more prominent in spain than elsewhere due to its very strong anarcho-syndicalist roots ) is going to turn up . 
  that 's a terrible argument . 
  firstly , palestine is a firmly established state and has been for longer than israel has , going further back than the british mandate of palestine which encompasses both [ israel and palestine ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/palestine_frontier_1922.png/320px-palestine_frontier_1922.png ) . 
  secondly , ignoring palestine 's historical borders , it 's modern day internationally recognized territory encompasses the west bank and gaza strip , the former of which is occupied by israel and the latter being under blockade and constant terror attacks by israel . 
  your statement is beyond ignorant and shows an absolutely absence of knowledge of the region in general . 
  if you are not even remotely informed on the topic , why do you comment on it ? 
   independent palestine will be another country of immature islamist like saudi arabia , egypt or syria . 
  and this told me you know nothing about the region , which i suspected from the start of your comment . 
  egypt and syria are not `` islamist '' countries . 
  they do not have sharia law . 
  they do not have restrictions on religious freedom . 
  of course , syria is in a civil war , but beforehand it was a secular country . 
  so your argument that palestine is doomed to become some islamist backwater has no basis in reality . 
  and so what if it does ? 
  that 's called self-determination , hamas and the plo are the democratic leaders of palestine . 
  israel is n't a pluralist country . 
  it is n't a stable country . 
  its contribution to science in anything other than developing new weapons is vastly overstated . 
  israel is an apartheid , jewish state that is as far right as any palestinian state would be . 
  in fact , it has repeatedly invaded and occupied the only other democratic country in the region ( lebanon ) . 
  there are no `` statistics '' of the state that you mentioned , just a laundry list of inaccuracy followed by a nonsensical attack on its neighbours . 
  our role should be to sanction israel . 
  people will call for russian blood in the streets because they 're initiating a proxy war in ukraine but wont bat an eye at the rampant human rights abuses of israel . 
  if we 're targeting countries like north korea , russia , iran and so on with sanctions , we should be consistent about it . 
  one would think an apartheid state that is occupying foreign land , denying people their right to self determination , violating the geneva convention on collective punishment , as well as violating a vast swathe of articles on human rights , is an apartheid state worth sanctioning . 
  right now all we keep doing is saying `` pretty please israel stop committing mass murder '' . 
  forcing sanctions on israel ( and on palestine as well in certain circumstances ) will at least give an air of seriousness to the peace talks ( right up until israel throws a hissy fit and calls us all antisemites ) and our role in them as a neutral observer and arbiter . 
  ah , just the kind of people we need in the world , religious nutjobs like you . 
  better to risk my life for nothing than to lose my life for nothing . 
  it 's not like their homeland , torn by war and exploited by western corporations , are exactly a good place to stay . 
  yeah , because a capitalist institution never receives subsidies for anything , just absolutely useless coops that do n't do anything for anyone ( except their workers , but fuck the workers they do n't matter unless they give profits to the capitalists ) . 
  the new one ... 
  * hillary * is too `` think of the children '' for you !? 
  12/10 representative of ireland, 
  absolutely not, 
  that 's the pessimist way of looking at it !, 
  ask what could go * right * !, 
  i 'm just going off your comment history . 
  i suppose in your world not a single individual has ever left a capitalist country ? 
  dae think communists are actually commu ** nazis ** !? 
  it 's not like people ever migrate out of capitalist countries amirite i bet you 're also the kind of person who thinks nazis were socialist , too . 
  anything to indicate those are actually in ukraine ? 
  yeah , how dare they take advantage of systems readily available to help them in order to improve their lives ? 
  a lot of that town is made possible through subsidies ; it is n't a profitable place , which is the whole point of the article - `` people before profit '' . 
  that does n't mean it 's not working . 
  it 's just wealth distribution . 
  how do you feel about all the european subsidies poland gets ? 
  so you 're telling me that people can ignore the market in a market based society ? 
  yeah ... 
  the whole idea that a single business owner is supposed to be responsible for job creation is what the invisible hand does . 
  the free market decides that someone can make a profit and as such they will borrow money from the bank , open a business and hire people to take part in wage-labour . 
  that is the invisible hand at work . 
  this is not what happened and this is why there are , contrary to the rest of spain , many employed people in that town . 
  it is n't a profitable town - it receives government subsidies , but regardless of that profit , the human cooperation has dramatically improved the living conditions of people in that town , and that is because they did not wait for the free market to recognize they were worth a shit . 
  instead , they created worker 's cooperatives - a socialist practice - collectivized the work for the community - a socialist practice - and are attempting to improve the lives of all the people in the community regardless of the profitability or their own personal wealth . 
  because people see `` communist '' and think `` communist = bad '' . 
  yeah guys !, 
  i ideologies i do n't understand should go away where i ca n't see them so i never have to think !, 
  yeah , because one person opening a business and receiving the fruits of the labour of 20 people is * so much better * than 20 people jointly opening the same business and sharing the profits equally . 
  in fairness , connolly was planning on staging his own uprising with the irish citizen 's army . 
  one would wonder what would 've happened had he tried to instigate a socialist revolution , but at the end of the day he was as much on board with the blood sacrifice idea as pearse was . 
  i 'm not sure if we 're allowed to play favourites , but out of all the people in our history , i love james connolly . 
  he was a true revolutionary and a man who truly believed in fighting for * everybody * , regardless of whether they were catholic , protestant , irish or british . 
  plus , he 's some serious quotesporn material . 
  it might then surprise people that the man was a member of the communist party right up until 1991 . 
   why is it that whenever someone criticizes islam , someone else inevitably comes in with `` but christians ! '' ? 
  because you targeted islam specifically . 
  why not criticize all religion , given that slavery also has an extremely prominent root in christianity ? 
  what is it about islam specifically ? 
  not to mention the anti-civil rights movement in say , countries like the us , were very much rooted in christian movements - for example , the klu klux klan . 
  christianity is of relevance to any discussion involving direct criticism of islam , as it is to ensure the logical consistency of the critic . 
  if islam is a truly evil belief system for x , y , and z reasons , then surely christianity ( and other beliefs ) should also be evil if they fit the same criteria . 
   i 'm not a christian and the actions of christians bear absolutely no relevance to this discussion . 
  yeah , sure , so you 're not a christian - why is it then the only religion you 're constantly criticizing in your comment history is islam , despite the fact it shares hundreds of similarities to christianity ? 
  why is it islam that is constantly the target ? 
  why not at least attempt to hide your bias , or be consistent , by criticizing religion as a whole ? 
  or even just abrahamic religions ? 
  nope , just islam . 
  in fact , you 've gone so far as to express open hatred for islam and advocate for ** banning ** it as a `` primitive , barbaric ideology '' . 
  so , tell me , where is this shared hatred for christianity ? 
  you 're not a christian , after all , you should be able to impartially assess both religions on their merits and reasonably deduce than they 're both incredibly similar in their teachings . 
  yet you do n't seem to ever speak negatively of christianity , or its other cousin religion , judaism . 
  assuming that you , as an indian-american , are atheist - why is it , then , that islam specifically , objectively , bothers you more than a practice of another religion that fits the same criteria ? 
   however , i will point out that no other modern religion ( christianity included ) , codifies and legitimizes slavery in its holy book the way islam does . 
  that is factually incorrect . 
  normally i would suggest a reread of both the bible and the qur ` an , but after reading your comments ( not just now , but in general on this subreddit ) , i am of the belief you have read neither the bible ** or ** the qur ` an , so there is no * re * read to be had . 
  i strongly suggest broadening your religious education beyond clickbait links which yield very little information - information that has no relevance to modern society . 
  it 's an effigy of a catholic and they 're hanging him . 
  yeah man cus slavery is exclusively islamic , christian europeans have * never * dealt in chattel slavery in their entire existence . 
  how dare those people fight for their interests . 
  and people say socialism ca n't work . 
  this is what happens when the workers take destiny into their own hands and stop waiting for the invisible hand to sort their lives out . 
   however , in many times in the past ( such as wwii ) our neutrality was very much one sided try telling that to a brit !, 
  they eventually went native , so you could argue is started with the cromwellian plantations . 
  it does not matter if it happens to both bing and google . 
  they are separate .
