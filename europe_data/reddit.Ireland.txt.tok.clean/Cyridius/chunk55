  that 's madness , we all know that the only bad people in the world are communazis , nationalists do n't pose any threat in europe . 
  physically ? 
  yes . 
  principally ? 
  i hear chopping my cock off lowers the risk by 100 % . 
  there is absolutely no proven benefit for a healthy , hygienic male . 
  it 's a practice that is driven by medical companies in the u.s. because there are significantly large profits to be made from it . 
  um , fgm is not an islamic practice . 
  male circumcision is , but not fgm . 
  fgm is an african practice that transcends borders and religions and is widely condemned by islamic scholars . 
  germany has almost no deals at all with russia . 
  i 'm down for that . 
  collectivize the benefits , collectivize the burdens . 
  what does that comment have to do with anything ? 
  are you suggesting we all become russia now ? 
  ** you make good on your word . 
  that is what a country with good international relations does , this is common sense **, 
  do you really want european companies to become more american ? 
  they 've been playing bad/mediocre the entire tournament . 
  with a result like 7-1 i do n't think there 's been a team more deserving of losing this wc . 
  does he mean an actual socialist or a social democrat ? 
  considering it 's s&d , probably the latter . 
  i certainly would n't complain about a shorter working week , anyhow . 
  as a unified force we would n't need to up our military spending . 
  we 've already got a huge army . 
  if anything we could probably downsize a bit in terms of manpower and spend a bit of that on expanding logistics capabilities . 
  yeah ... 
  i was kind of like `` we do n't need no mo-fuckin ' united snakes of amerikka '' and then i saw that . 
   i do n't think there is anything particularly left about this and i would rather prefer if it was not proposed in a left vs. 
  right dichotomy . 
  i mean i would rather prefer if people who identify with the right would not be alienated from it by presenting it as a leftist idea . 
  it is very much a leftist policy . 
  it 's something leftists have fought for and those in the right have fought against for a long , long time . 
  it was the communists that fought long and hard for the 8 hour workday , and again you can see here this solution was pushed forward by a coalition of three leftist parties , while it was opposed by everyone else . 
  the shorter workday has always been part of the worker 's rights movement , and communists , socialists etc. 
  have always been at the centre of that . 
  the shorter workday is something worker 's rights activists have been fighting for for over 100 years . 
  your same argument could 've been used back when we secured the 8 hour workday . 
  but i do n't think i can expect a nuanced appreciation of islam and the qur ` an from someone who posts to / r/conspiracy and who claims that muslims `` will be fighting right in europe '' and who states `` killing a muslim is always positive '' . 
  go back to whatever little hole of stupidity you came from , and please stay there . 
  he posted the same bullshit here . 
  i think it 's really important this is done right , because it could lead to a very important change for not just gothenberg , but for the people of sweden and potentially everyone in europe . 
  so , while i 'm dismayed it 's been delayed , if the research is done seriously , it 's important to realize that delays are part of quality . 
  i also think it 's very important for people to see the good things the left can bring them as opposed to simply the usual rhetoric we 're all so fond of . 
  ** requirements ** - account age  1 year * yes * - 500 + combined karma in any subreddit * yes * - be on reddit at least once per day to review the mod queue * yes * - moderate at least one other community of 1,000 subscribers * no * ** questions ** do you have any experience with automoderator ( / r/automoderator [ 1 ] ) , css or the mod toolbox ( / r/toolbox [ 2 ] ) ? 
  ( not required ) ------------- i do n't have much experience with either of those three ; i have toolbox installed , so i 'm familiar enough with how it works . 
  automod , not so much . 
  i 've never used it . 
  and in regards to css , i 've dabbled but i 've not designed entire subreddits . 
  i do have a sub that i screw around with on occasion to try this or that bit of css but it 's usually very small things . 
  ------------- what timezone are you in , and when are you generally on reddit ? 
  -------- i 'm in the utc/gmt timezone . 
  resident of ireland . 
  i 'm on reddit a few times a day and i do n't really have a fixed schedule in that regards . 
  ------------- what is your favorite/least favorite thing about r/europe and what could be implemented to make it better ? 
  --------- i think / r/europe is great because it 's a place to discuss europe and european things , and news in context with europe , that you do n't really get anywhere else in the us-dominated reddit . 
  it 's like a little space for european perspectives to take the forefront over everything . 
  what i dislike about it is the racism , and even just general nationalist tendencies . 
  it 's a decent enough reflection of europe in that regard , i suppose , but there is often an absurd amount of racism and general hate speech and what it does is generally bring the discussion down , and personally think that 's a function of users from places like / pol / coming in a flooding specific threads . 
  i 'm also a very political person by nature , so i tend to get rather annoyed over `` informed ignorance '' ( where someone who has all the information will still ignore it in favour of a warped view ) . 
  what moderators can do to fix that is really rather limited in scope . 
  it 's very much an attitude issue and moderating does n't make that attitude change or go away , unless you straight up ban the culprits , and at the same time it brings up the question of whether moderators should really be policing opinions . 
  i think when it comes to simply hateful racism/xenophobia etc. , it should get hit with the mod-hammer and after a certain number of warnings , just ban the user . 
  of course , with the size of this subreddit , you need more mods for that . 
  enter me !, 
  i think in general , moderation has its place , and i think a lot of users like to point to / r/askhistorians as an exemplar of the quality of a strictly moderated sub , but i think that is n't precisely the style / r/europe is going for ; while we do want good discussions with value and ideas and constructive debate , i do n't think we really want to make this a subreddit for `` expert discussion '' , so to speak . 
  so there is a very fine line in this regard . 
  but the friendly atmosphere of / r/askhistorians is something i think all subs should strive for . 
  ----------- what would make you a good moderator ? 
  ----------- it 's a tough question , really . 
  i 've moderated outside of reddit before , so i know how to arbitrate disputes . 
  while i do get passionate about topics ( even to the point where i could be called disruptive ) , i am capable of being objective with authority while doing so , so there would n't be a case where i 'd simply abuse it when i got annoyed and cause problems . 
  with that objectivity , i also think i could fairly enforce the rules , regardless of what those rules are . 
  so , in that context , i 'll still be my usual self in discussions , but when it comes to moderation , i 'll be far more professional . 
  i also think i would be pretty transparent with users and very active and open in communication with other moderators . 
  i 'm also pretty active so i 'll be able to see things happening , and also with that activity , i have an interest in seeing this sub thrive . 
  / r/europe is where i post more than any other subreddit , so i would have great care in ensuring it maintains the quality it deserves . 
  i also think i could bring some pretty good ideas to the moderator team . 
  so , in short , i obviously have my faults ; i can get aggressive , abrasive , - even too personal - in discussions . 
  but with that , is also the ability to be a quality contributor and when i become moderator , the negative aspects will give way to a more professional approach . 
  and with that responsibility , i will do my utmost to make / r/europe the best subreddit it can be . 
  airport security is one of the most useless endevours ever . 
  someone with half a brain would be able to fashion an explosive and some weapons using what they can get on the other side of it or what they can get through anyways . 
  not to mention it misses shit so often . 
  i once forgot i had my swiss army knife in my bag and they totally missed it . 
  it 's crazy and sad , really . 
  here is a terrible man , a man who has done terrible things as a gangster ; injured people , stole from them , probably killed people . 
  and then when he finds the will power to finally make himself a better person , to change who he is ... 
  he goes off to fight some twisted war allah would have never asked for , in his name . 
  and i think that 's just tragic . 
  no i 'm not overreacting in the slightest . 
  every single time we discuss any politics in regards to russia and europe , in comes one of you saying `` but in communist poland x y z '' . 
  if you want to use the nazi vs. soviet argument , let 's talk about nazi propaganda of the jews . 
  for every single piece of `` correct '' propaganda the nazis put out , there are hundreds of lies , hate mongering , bullshit . 
  if you want to defend that , fine . 
  but then you are no better than them in that regard . 
  if you want to support propaganda networks because they tell the right lies , you are no better than the russians you speak out against . 
  i will remember this next time you complain about propaganda . 
  being against immigration does n't make you a racist . 
  being against foreigners because they 're foreigners makes you a racist .
