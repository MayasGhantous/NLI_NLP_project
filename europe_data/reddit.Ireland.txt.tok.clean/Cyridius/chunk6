  stop playing stupid . 
   do you have any articles about them fighting is ?

  these are really obvious and i should n't have to explain them to you . 
   because they 're terrorists ? 
  if it looks like a terrorist , walks like a terrorist , is denounced like a terrorist and kidnaps children like a terrorist ... it might be a terrorist . 
  this bad logic and bad reasoning . 
  people do n't do things `` because they are terrorists '' . 
  they do things for specific reasons which are intended to progress towards a specific goal . 
   i 'm using it to mean `` a person who uses terrorism in the pursuit of political aims '' , a description that fits the taliban and the pkk . 
  in that case , almost everybody 's a terrorist . 
   so are they fighting is ? 
  or just affiliated with a group that is ? 
  both  kazakhstan , azerbaijan , syria , and kyrgyzstan are n't in nato . 
  why do they list pkk as a terror group ? 
  syria because their affiliate groups are active in syrian kurdistan - same reason with iran . 
  kazakhstan and turkey have quite close diplomatic relations , they support eachother on the international stage with various things and turkey was the first country to recognize kazakhstan in 1991 , as well as building a pipeline ( with georgia and azerbaijan ) . 
  not to mention kazakhstan , along with azerbaijan , and kyrgyzstan are members of the [ turkic council ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkic_council )  france has them listed as a terrorist group . 
  according to wikipedia france '' bans organisations connected to the pkk on terrorism-related charges '' . 
  yes , it does . 
  france has , quite recently , complied more with turkey 's demands at a more hardline stance against the pkk and its affiliated organizations . 
  they - along with belgium and the netherlands have started going out of their way to hunt down training camps and organizations in europe affiliated with the pkk . 
   so they did n't kidnap children earlier this year ? 
  this is a horrifying and entirely immoral practice , and i do n't understand why they would do something like that . 
   the taliban also had a lot of popular support for a time . 
  i 'm willing to bet more than 15,000 afghans support them , are they also not terrorists ? 
  i would n't call them terrorists , no . 
  they were an ultraconservative undemocratic government that was in the way . 
  if we 're going to use the term `` terrorists '' for `` people we do n't like '' then there is no point having this conversation . 
   is pkk fighting is ? 
  yes . 
  they 're also affiliated with the ypg in syria which is doing the bulk of the us-backed fighting in syria , most notably now in kobane ( along with some fsa ) . 
   if they are n't a terrorist organization , why are they considered such by nato , the usa , and the eu ? 
  they 're not even considered terrorists by everyone in the eu . 
  just the institution , and to show the entirely political nature of that designation , the eu has ignored european court rulings to annul the designation of the pkk as terrorists . 
  why ? 
  well turkey is in nato and the designation was entirely a political move to satisfy them . 
  they 're a national liberation movement acting against the interests of the turkish government . 
  turkey is in nato . 
  there 's your link . 
  eu countries have ~ ~ all ~ ~ aided pkk leaders and militants at some stage ; greece armed them in the 90 's , austria helped them avoid interpol , they have various connections with various european governments like france as well , their tv stations are allowed to broadcast here , we let movements that support and fund them act without much harassment , and various things like that . 
  we do n't even believe ourselves when we call them terrorists . 
  that 's not to give them a spotless record . 
  not by a very , very long shot . 
  they 've done some very bad things . 
  on the flip side , the turkish government has done just as bad ( arguments can be made that say they 've done worse ) yet we do not consider them terrorists . 
  the pkk has , in the past , bombed civilian targets , and killed civilians intentionally . 
  which is bad . 
  but they 've always been moving away from that and have , generally , moved away from it altogether , though only in the 7 or 8 years or so . 
  for a `` terror organization '' , they have quite a lot of popular support from the people they claim to be fighting for - you do n't get a 15,000 + strong fighting force with 30 years of fighting without the support of the people you live amongst . 
  is that why we went to korea ? 
  host nato bases and nukes and helped protect the west against the soviets ? 
  yeah , and were you protecting the west when you arrest kurds going over the border by the hundreds and let is recruits slip on by ? 
   last time you could n't argue with me you said `` i had a big empire mentality '' oh ? 
  * i * could n't argue ? 
  i was n't the one who said the kurds has no right to independence . 
  yeah , i actually think i ca n't argue against someone who 's against human rights . 
  let 's quote your little gem of big empire mentality ;  i am against both their goal and their means to reach them . 
  occupied state , yeah right . 
  we 've held that territory for literally a millenium with no problems . 
  you heard it here , folks !, 
  kurds have * no right * to self-determination . 
  independence , shall be combated at all costs . 
  and hey ...  if they fight , they 'll be fought against . 
  seems simple enough . 
  and people wonder why there 's a `` terrorist '' organization . 
  great fucking logic there . 
  but hey , if you want to misquote me by saying you 're `` like a serb '' , let me just quote myself ;  you sound like a serbian ** that 's still buttsore that people wanted to leave the glorious yugoslavian federation ** . 
  i love your little `` play dumb '' mentality . 
  keep spewing the propaganda of the turkish government , maybe one day someone other than you will believe it . 
  the `` race to the bottom '' you describe is a key element to neoliberal policies . 
  deregulation , privatization , cuts to spending , free market - * laissez-faire * . 
  this does not produce a wealthy population which can spend money to stimulate the economy . 
  what you 're describing here only requires one word ; neoliberalism, 
  well are n't you the official representative ? 
  ok , now how do i pronounce * that * . 
  `` could be '' ? 
  it was . 
  until 2002 they were under * military rule * and the kurdish people were treated as enemies . 
  they were tortured , massacred , imprisoned without cause , the villages were bombed and the the children taken away . 
  the level of damage caused by turkey as opposed to the pkk is astronomical ( this is not to play down the pkk side , who have killed thousands upon thousands ) . 
  even when in 2006 the pkk declared a unilateral ceasefire with the intent to talk , turkey kept bombing . 
  if you are asking the kurds about the pkk condoning the killing of innocent people , you should go back to istanbul and ask the turks the same thing about their own governments . 
  the difference is that one group is fighting for national liberation and self-determination and the other one is fighting for oppression and land . 
  oh , and it happens to be in nato . 
  though its commitment to the alliance is obviously a load of horseshit when it 's doing everything it can to improve the position of daesh against the kurds , the only force on the ground capable of fighting them off right now . 
  i do n't condone the pkk 's actions which specifically targeted civilian - though i think it should be noted that attacks on tourists have been almost all carried out by tak and condemned by the pkk , though this is not civilians as a whole and this is wrong - but their designation as a terror organization is a joke when they are a popularly supported group with very specific political aims , in which they would stop fighting when their aims are met . 
  they 're not al qaeda who would go find a new enemy after they beat their old one , nor are they daesh who would not be content with simply iraq or syria . 
  it 's not just `` shitty on both sides '' , it 's one side ( turkey ) taking a shit on the other and then getting it thrown back at them . 
  turks ca n't handle people disagreeing with their government propaganda . 
   pkk is a terrorist organization and they have been siegeing military posts for 4 days now . 
  according to turkish government . 
  the source for all that is true and free , clearly . 
  the blockade is illegal under international law and is a total blockade . 
  please read up on the history of the blockade before spreading lies . 
  you can not have democracy while under occupation and siege . 
  or is the secession of crimea legitimate to you ? 
   so the other 76 % of the population who all earn less only make up 20 % . 
  it hardly seems fair that the top 24 % of earners should pay for everything hence 20 % comes from the rest of the population . 
  and tell me , what % of this country 's wealth do these people earn ?
