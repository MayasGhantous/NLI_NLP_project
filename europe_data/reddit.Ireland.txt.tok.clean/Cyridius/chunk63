  right now this is n't ideological or even on policy , this is a power struggle between the federal eu gov and the states . 
  heil o'duffy, 
  that 's hilarious , loads of the people in that thread are literally the people he 's making fun of . 
  see it 's because ukrainians are n't actually an ethnicity , they 're really just russian / s, 
  loyalist scumbags give everyone that 's not a white british protestant a lot of shtick . 
  that joke is as fucking hilarious as it is dark . 
  black humour man , polandball is great for it . 
   russia borders ** buffer nations ** why do n't you just tell us you 're in favour of puppet states , dictatorship and backwards , primitive concepts such as vassal states and denial to self-determination ? 
   the current ukrainian state is an artificial construct of soviet border drawing . 
  * this * dumbfuck argument again . 
  you 're retarded . 
  nuclear war would n't end humanity , but the likelihood of it ending society as we know it is pretty high . 
  nuclear fallout would be global , as well . 
  yeah , what a dumbass , everyone knows american is the first language ever . 
  you 're fucked in the head . 
  the first thing you do when you hear about a 16yo being tortured to the brink of death is bring up crimes perpetrated by people of his ethnicity to justify it . 
  some people do n't consider him serious or radical enough . 
  well that was rather anticlimactic . 
   and they hate `` anarcho capitalists '' because those are too radical with removing the state . 
  something tells me that is n't why they hate anarcho - *** capitalists ***, 
   what are the people responsible for that ? 
  self-proclaimed anarchists trying to `` raise awareness '' or people just looking to cause trouble . 
  true , but i do n't go there for the intelligent discussion . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'll give it a shot when i see the chance . 
  yes , the monopoly on violence is a pretty big deal . 
  but from my experience with anarchism - both in reality and on the interwebs/articles - it just does n't look like it wants to organize . 
  edit : except maybe anarcho-syndicalists, 
   sort of the opposite of say , leninist `` democratic centralism '' yes , `` variety in discussion , unity in action '' , i never really bought into how lenin did it , though to be fair to the man he staged a successful revolution . 
  though it really depends on how it 's done , i prefer a more decentralized method based on a system of soviets . 
   ever heard of iww ? 
  iww is n't really anarchist , but point is taken . 
  interesting . 
  i always believed internationalist thought was a byproduct of economic stance , strange to see it become so bastardized elsewhere . 
  turkey does tend to have much stronger socialist and communist tendencies ( tkp comes to mind ) , so it 's not surprised it 's on the turkish side . 
   my point is that you have to think hard and long about whether you are looking at the evidence and deciding on a conclusion or you are making up a conclusion first and rationalising why it 's correct second . 
  the thing is that anarchism then means something different to how it does now . 
  anarchists were willing to be politically active , organized , and were actually willing to launch an organized worker 's revolution . 
  today , i would n't be able to say the same thing . 
  today , anarchism is more about breaking windows and shouting `` anarchy ! '', 
  than it is about actually progressing the movement . 
  they 're so anti-establishment that they literally refuse to organize themselves , and that 's just ridiculous . 
  and this is coming from someone who used to identify himself as an anarchist . 
  it was n't an ideological shift that made me decide to ditch anarchism , though that did come later , it was the people . 
  if you need to look at the difference , you just need to read about the anarchist movement in spain in the 30 's , and in catalonia during the civil war . 
  they were organized and getting shit done right up until uncle joe stabbed them in the back . 
  so , it 's not really much of a `` well you 're just using nostalgia to justify your views '' , it 's more like `` anarchists today are different to those yesterday , and i prefer the ones yesterday '', 
   just to belong to the group . 
  well that 's just ironic i do n't like anarchists , because it changed from being anti-state to anti-organization . 
  anarchists ( generally ) reject trade unions , reject the idea of forming leftist organizations which can act in anarchist interests , reject the idea of working with other leftists , and reject the idea of democratic reform . 
  if you 're going to reject democratic reform * and * reject extra-political organization , then you 're not in any sort of position to ever change anything . 
  they 're so anti-establishment that they just shoot themselves in the foot . 
  spanish civil war , bro . 
  satire with a historical context about one of the most violent and bloody civil wars in europe ? 
  i think it fits , personally . 
  / r/lewronggeneration is an amazing sub . 
  because it is n't an islamic practice . 
  it 's a cultural mindset . 
  yeah , one influences the other , but they 're not the same thing . 
  there are some christian countries with higher rates of fgm , and it 's exceedingly common all across africa , regardless of religious dominance . 
  nah , the source is in the album . 
  here it is ; http://rednblacksalamander.deviantart.com/, 
  how 's the socialist movement in cyprus , anyhow ? 
  they 've failed the people ; they 've been a smashing success for the ~ ~ slave ~ ~ corporate owners though . 
  circumcision is obviously fucking stupid , but this really has nothing to do with that right now . 
  as a circumcised male ( * shakes fist angrily at islamic traditions * ) , from what i understand that medically fgm is a very different beast to male circumcision . 
  it actually does n't , given that it has no basis in islam and is condemned as a practice by islamic scholars . 
  your xenophobia is n't an answer to everything , you know . 
  [ yes , it 's wrong ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2io5ifwkdw ), 
   rather than the imbeciles that make it to be head of government . 
  so you would rather someone who 's only qualification is being born to represent you instead ? 
  i volunteer . 
  of course you 'd disagree . 
  american ideas of justice are a joke . 
  i do n't know what 's to like about someone who will have elevated status and things such as legal immunity for their entire life just by pure chance of them being born to the right parents . 
  one should not be punished for the wrongdoings of others . 
   not a terrible loss if he actually did it . 
  such barbaric thinking . 
  at least they did n't get knocked out in the group stages . 
  at least you got into the group stages ... 
  the us also has a gdp more than 7 times higher . 
   as long as you have even semi-legit elections you have democracy . 
  i would argue otherwise . 
  in an election where all the candidates are using the same playbook , there is no democracy , yet it would be entirely legitimate . 
  democracy can be one thing and one thing only . 
  the will of the people made manifest . 
  representative democracy is a sham where men and women will run on policies and promises that they have no intention in following through on . 
  it 's a lie , and as such the will of the people is not being heard , is not being followed , and the ruling system can not be democratic . 
  sometimes when someone is healing a broken bone , it does n't set right . 
  you do n't just tell them `` well , that sucks , you 'll just have to deal with the handicap '' and let the bone heal badly . 
  you just have to break it again and set it right . 
  the only way to permanently ensure true democracy is to have the people control how their lives are governed , directly , and have this right constitutionally enshrined . 
  a heavily decentralized , localized form of government managed with direct democracy is as close to will of the people one can get . 
  the people should be the second house of legislation . 
  dublin city is the least irish part of ireland . 
  if you wanted to get traditional ireland , go to places like galway . 
  even cork would be grand . 
  you do n't go to dublin expecting to see many gaelgoir . 
   what if irish took english 's place and people 's knowledge of english become comparable to their current knowledge of irish ? 
  ireland would be a more closed off culture .
