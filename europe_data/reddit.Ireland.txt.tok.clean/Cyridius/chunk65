  you 're right , you ca n't make a living . 
  if a bulgarian is moving to sweden and taking a job in a logistics company , he will need a living wage . 
  if a bulgarian is in bulgaria and taking a swede 's job , that 's just outsourcing and that has nothing to do with immigration , but with neoliberal globalization of the workforce . 
  we can keep increasing the minimum wage , but all that will lead to in the long run is capital flight to other , poorly regulated countries , as is happening now with manufacturing and resource harvesting in south america , africa and asia . 
   all radical solutions are bad , we should make this process slow so these type of wage gaps can not happen . 
  this is just the middle ground fallacy . 
  an `` even '' approach is n't necessarily the best one . 
  it is that same `` even '' approach that has led to this situation , with social democratic governments being unable to pay their bills and being unable to keep their population happy and employed . 
  one would argue that the * only * solution would be a radical one . 
   does he somewhere prove that communism would do equally or greater amount of economic growth ? 
  if we were to take marx 's analysis - which is statistically supported by piketty ( this is excluding marx 's own work which is sufficient in of itself ) - yes . 
  using marx as an example , he theorizes that capitalism has a time and place in terms of propelling economic and scientific progress , but will inevitably become detrimental to the population , stagnate and lead to ever increasing inequality , erosion of democracy and , eventually , tyranny . 
  the evidence of these predictions coming to pass is evident for every informed person to see , regardless of your stance of marxism or socialism in general . 
  and to add , it 's argued the , in the same way capitalism emerged from feudalism , socialism will emerge from capitalism and , some argue , communism will emerge from socialism . 
  it 's a natural process . 
  you will not find many socialists who will say `` capitalism has never done anything good '' , but you will find that every socialist will say `` capitalism is not benefiting the population anymore , it 's time we need to move on '' , and that stance is very much supported by the facts , and you can see the effects of capitalism very presently in current events . 
  `` if you say that white people are saying racist shit about non-whites , you 're racist '' - / u/llanita going by your other racially motivated comments , you 're part of the problem . 
  piketty - the \\ # 1 statistician on this planet - has empirically shown in his book * capital in the 21st century * what marx laid out in his initial writings such as * das kapital * . 
  that under capitalism , the rate of increase of gdp is getting lower and lower , and inequality is increasing - ** everywhere ** . 
  productivity is not increasing . 
  immigration was n't the key point . 
  he mentioned it insofar that immigrants were being used as a scapegoat by right wing parties and the ruling class in order to shift attention away from the actual economic issues . 
  that people who did not know better were taken in by this idea out of desperation , not malicious intent . 
  that is not what i said in the slightest . 
  how much racist shit do you see about white europeans said here ? 
  none . 
  how much racist shit do you see about non-white europeans said here ? 
  tonnes of shit . 
  it 's a very easy and logical conclusion to make that the racist people here are white/european . 
  that is not even remotely - not even in the *** same fucking league *** - as saying `` all white europeans are racist '' . 
  i know you like to make gigantic , illogical leaps , but even for a contrarian like you this is a stretch . 
  have you read any books on the matter ? 
  preferably by reputable economists ? 
  [ citation needed ], 
  that 's not what he said . 
  general population is disillusioned with current establishment , will vote for anyone who looks like they 're promising change . 
  this explains rise in far right in greece , france and denmark . 
  syriza and podemos make major gains , thus opening up the possibility for a major anti-capitalist movement in europe , especially if they translate these gains into national elections . 
  so calling out people for being racist is racist now ? 
  til, 
  hah , good one . 
  this subreddit has a major race problem . 
  and that problem is n't that there are too many non-christian non-white non-middle class europeans . 
   did i say that it should be tolerated ? 
  it 's pretty heavily implied . 
  any thread involving muslims , immigrants , socialists or roma is going to go bad places . 
  israel gets mixed reactions , surprisingly . 
  that 's probably because they 're mostly american and right wing , so they see israel as an ally against all the evil muslims . 
   i 'm just shocked i 'm shocked that you 're shocked . 
  / r/europe is a hub for racism and it 's validated by the sheer number of them that are here . 
  it 's pretty representative of europe as a whole , though . 
  i 've had people here telling me i should go back to my own country because my parents were immigrants . 
  because `` quality of healthcare '' is n't something you call a category . 
  if you wanted `` quality of healthcare '' then there 's no detail or nuance to the study , all you 'd need to do is have one rating for quality of healthcare and another for cost . 
  if you actually read it and make an attempt to understand it , the `` quality of healthcare '' is pretty much a natural conclusion of the categories already there . 
  it tells you in the link ... 
  `` but the government can never do anything efficiently ! '', 
  what about gitmo ? 
  you 're creating a false-dichotomy and you know it . 
  you know and i know and everyone who 's read his comment knows that he did not mean `` every single roma ever on this planet is living in absolute abject poverty '' , and you can spin all the anecdotes and try to use `` but i 'm * technically * correct '' all you like , but it does n't make what you said any less intentionally misleading . 
  oh , wow , this is such a load of shit . 
  most roma live like absolute shit and everyone with common sense knows that . 
  people who are loaded do not spend their lives committing petty crime that they can get done for . 
  roma are and have been - *** particularly *** in the last century - been discriminated against , persecuted , and worse . 
   the law stand because most peoples do n't want to break it in significant ways . 
  that 's the way it is with all law in any country . 
  when the general population decides it will ignore a law or policy , the courts will never keep up and the police will just stop enforcing it . 
  tl ; dr nazification, 
  `` whataboutism '' is n't a fucking catch-all to end an argument . 
  he 's making valid points through use of so-called `` whataboutism '' that do , in fact , pertain to the discussion . 
  a lot of scum were n't even tried at nuremberg . 
   but since the decision has to be made at some point does it really , though ? 
  finland has played the russians and nato off for decades . 
  if they continued their approach of neutrality , they can still maintain the benefits of nato protection while maintaining solid relations with russia . 
  and realistically you wont join without sweden . 
  just because a country is predominantly muslim does not mean that it is inherently backword or conservative , and people really need to shake this perception . 
  you 're right though , the longer akp is in power , the more regressive it becomes . 
   nice . 
  did n't they just lost at 20 ' 000 vs like 1 ' 500 ? 
  so much for hardware alone ... 
  they barely even fought . 
  they fled , and left 400 million usd worth of american equipment for isil to loot . 
   is that true ? 
  more or less . 
  every institution is corrupt . 
  when we discussion `` corruption '' , i suppose it should be '' ** extreme ** corruption '' , which is pervasive at the national level in eastern europe/balkans . 
  i say leave it . 
  this is a problem that only the iraqi people can solve . 
  if the west intervenes , there 's no legitimacy to the end result . 
  the iraqi army is extremely well equipped . 
  it just has shit morale because the people they 're fighting for are arguably worse than ol' saddam himself , just with a facade of democracy . 
  that there are thousands of iraqi troops , even at top levels , that are questioning whether isil or maliki are worse than one another is a serious indicator of much more fundamental issues in iraqi politics that we can not solve with more bombs . 
  we may bomb isil to the stone age , but that does n't solve the underlying issues that are allowing such a *** small *** force to plow through iraq . 
  though , of course , if the us does not intervene , [ iran will beat them to the punch . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/14/iran-iraq-isis-fight-militants-nouri-maliki ) a big thing that 's happening now though is that shia muslims all across iraq are flocking to the fight , because if isil takes control of their neighbourhoods they 're either gon na kill or expel all non-sunnis living there . 
  so there 's a potential here for a dramatic rise in sunni-shia conflict in iraq . 
  just let them fight it out . 
  the people of iraq will fight isil or stand with them . 
  it is not for us to decide . 
  when the current established system of corporate feudalism is abolished and we depose the ruling class , sure thing .
