  maybe if they tax it high enough they 'll take enough money out of circulation to cancel out the inflation effect , but that 'll just piss off the middle class , who wont benefit from basic income at all . 
  it 's trying to impose socialist social principles into a capitalist economy using a capitalist frame work , and i just do n't see that working . 
  if you want to try and alleviate massive unemployment using capitalist methods you * have to * make education absolutely accessible and encourage a start-up economy where people band together and encourage worker 's cooperatives . 
  i personally consider that only half way doing it , but if there 's any alleviation to be found in the capitalist framework , i do n't see any other way the people do not get massively fucked . 
  surely though we should be focusing on improving standard of living and lowering the retirement age as opposed to making it easier for old people to work ? 
  that was an entirely unexpected turn of events . 
  anyone who claims there is symmetry between left and right knows neither the left or the right . 
  his videos on idioms are hilarious . 
  we 're not a beautiful people . 
  that 's why i love all the polish immigrants !, 
   `` imperialist '' would imply that libya would be added to the attacker 's country proper not really , no . 
  an imperialist war is waged in order to exert your influence of another country in the region in order to specifically benefit at the expense of that country . 
  you do n't need to change borders , just either subjugate the current government or install a friendly one , therefore expanding your sphere of influence in the region . 
  you can not say the libya of today is hostile towards western powers as it was under ghadaffi . 
  to people talking about how he 's not complaining about the pro-eu comments , you 've missed the entire point of this post . 
  euroskeptics believe they 're treated unfairly on this subreddit . 
  not a totally unfounded opinion , but one i generally speaking disagree with . 
  what he is saying , however , is that you can not expect to be well received when your comments have no nuance to them . 
  if you express your opinion in terms of `` you 're all fucking stupid '' , or `` you people are all sheep bowing to your european masters '' , or `` the eu is the axis of evil '' , which , while the comments may not be so blatant as to say it in such plain terms , many of the so-called euroskeptic comments are limited to that kind of expression . 
  so , when you put those up and get massive amounts of downvotes , you ca n't complain about the circlejerk going against you . 
  yeah , that same circlejerk will upvote comments of similar quality that are pro-eu , we get it . 
  it 's a problem . 
  but it 's not one you can solve in the reddit system , so really for purposes of this debate , ignore it . 
  what he is saying , i believe , is that when you 're trying to go against the circlejerk , you need to frame your opinions intelligently to actually show that you understand the issues and nuances . 
  the problem arises when even the intelligently framed posts are downvoted , but that can go either way depending on the thread and even time of the day . 
  what makes you think everyone wants to go to the uk ? 
  yeah , people are too stupid for democracy / s, 
  you 're right , it 's a constitutional monarchy . 
  this argument is a load of crap . 
  yes, 
  it was a rather ** hands off ** approach ( \u2022 _ \u2022 ) ( \u2022 _ \u2022 )  \u2310 \u25a0 - \u25a0 [ ( \u2310 \u25a0 _ \u25a0 ) ] ( http://www.myinstants.com/instant/yeah/ ), 
  it 's called the ** cock ** pit of europe for a reason . 
  it 's like the village bike . 
  us island folk are inbred . 
  get outta my union ye bad-teeth 'd ugly red skinned bastards with yer bad food and yer tourism and yer uncontrollable alcohol abuse . 
   i was a bit shocked to learn that neither the british ** nor the irish ** consider themselves european . 
  what ? 
  i never understood why countries do not hold referendums for such important things . 
  in doggy years . 
  an alliance of conservatives and reformists study ? 
  that surely has no biases . 
  another few choice quotes ; `` more integration in the eurozone * is inevitable * , when we have a common currency , we need more common policies ... that is the logical consequence of the choice we made many years in the treaty of maastricht '' `` we have overcame the existential threat to the eurozone , i have never said we have overcame already the job crisis and the economic crisis '' `` often we acted a little too late '' `` the message of extremists , this is not helpful at all ... 
  when your proposal is to leave the european union , is that not extremist ? '', 
  `` there was a problem of structural unemployment in the eurozone , long before the crisis , we did n't tackle that problem at that time ... 
  it was a failure , i will not discuss the responsibility , so let 's say it was a collective responsibility '', 
  a wide range of sources , from first hand accounts , to history books , to documentaries , to things as simple as wikipedia . 
  and of course , school , but everyone knows that simplifies it down , biases it and is n't nearly in depth enough for a full understanding . 
  i do n't see these demonstrators toting ak-47s and bombing buildings . 
  the whole point of the freedom of movement ( which ireland should not be exempt from , but i digress ) is that it is no different going from paris to antwerp then from birmingham to london . 
  and it 's their democratic right to attempt that , democratically . 
  it 's a throwaway troll account . 
  i 'm just using your logic . 
  you 're telling me it does n't matter how or why a friend/relative has been killed , and that it will create separatists . 
  but for some reason which you have absolutely not elaborated on , this only applies for one specific situation , which kind of removes the whole `` does n't matter '' argument you 've proposed . 
  so , either you 're contradicting yourself or , yes , your logic has gone completely over my head . 
  basic military strategy dictates your cripple the enemy infrastructure before trying to attack . 
  this is one of the reasons why . 
  you go in when they have their full coordinated ability and you 're going to end flattening half the city and you 'll turn everyone against you . 
  i humoured you up until this point because i was curious as to what your logic would be , but you have none . 
  for some reason an ** attack ** on the ground which causes magnitudes more casualties and collateral damage is preferable to an ** attack ** on the air , because both sides will be shooting and therefore nobody will get blamed when someone gets killed in the crossfire . 
  this makes no sense . 
  people do not think like that . 
  the two armies do not line up in a field and a load of civilians do not , of their own volition , stand between them . 
  there is no situation where this turns out well for the ukrainian authorities in terms of public opinion , so they 're going for the route that makes the most military sense . 
  to quote you ;  you think the family and friends of those `` casualties '' are going to be listening to you or kiev lecture them on tactics on why it 's acceptable to bomb them ? 
  they 're not going to care how their family/friend is killed . 
   yes it would be far bloodier and have greater casualties , but it least it would be more likely to decrease the number of separatists rather than increase it . 
  and you make this statement based on what ? 
  you 're saying airstrikes cause separatists because their family members are getting killed . 
  a ground attack would massively increase the number of dead civilians . 
  massively . 
  a ground attack is simply not feasible . 
  at all . 
   given that they have such overwhelming advantage no they do n't . 
  my comment went entirely over your head . 
  ok , so , no air strike . 
  how do you propose the ukrainian government deal with the separatist administration in luhansk ? 
  he sounds like a fucking retard . 
  well , shucks guys , i guess we should just burn all the human rights documents . 
  you realize the *** whole point *** of a universal human *** right *** is that it is taken as granted and supersedes all levels of law ? 
  the situation would be a lot of worse off if we let the state devolve into an open civil war . 
  the problem was simply bombing the shit out of things and then leaving it alone , which is a typical western thing to do . 
   they could just ship them back , with military escort , to the country they disembarked from . 
  if they 're calling for asylum , that 's illegal and a violation of human rights . 
  which is not a policy we should encourage or adopt . 
  racial profiling creates more problems than it solves . 
  try making neutral comments with any flag . 
  but this is n't a hostage situation , it 's a regime propped up by an external government . 
  first thing you do in a war ( and this is a war , let 's be real ) is try and knock out the administration to make it harder to coordinate . 
  unaligned people do die in this situation , yes , and it 's tragic and should absolutely be avoided at all costs , yes , but i 'm sure it 's a damn sight less civilian casualties than trying to take it on the ground . 
  use of cluster bombs are illegal and i doubt the ukrainian airforce has any . 
  yup . 
  but most wo n't because it is n't practical or sustainable , and they 're culturally the same . 
  not so with scotland . 
  the uk will become mighty and strong again and all will be right in the world . 
  it 's also in a densely populated civilian area . 
  you ca n't do that shit , man .
