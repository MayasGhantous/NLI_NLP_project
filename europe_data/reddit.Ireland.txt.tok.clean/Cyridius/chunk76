  how do you mix capitalism with the thing created specifically to destroy it ? 
  socialism is created under one condition ; worker control of the means of production . 
  this is fundamentally the opposite to capitalism . 
  more pints . 
   this is however limiting freedom . 
  limiting the freedom of corporations . 
  like i give a fuck . 
   saying people can not own stuff is terrible not what socialism is . 
   read up . 
  nice wiki page bro , if i spam you with them does that make me automatically right ? 
   because countries like china and russia are totally 100 % completely green . 
  you 're so ignorant and like to just point fingers at others . 
  where has country even come into this ? 
  both russian and china are capitalist states . 
   capitalism is exactly what 's doing this . 
  no it absolutely is not . 
  capitalism is in no way ; * paying workers what they are worth . 
  in order for capitalists to make a profit they can not pay workers the value of their productivity . 
  this is a fundamental fact . 
  * it is not reforming the system , and actively campaigns against any and all infringements on its exploitation of the workers . 
  * it is not abolishing corporate hierarchy . 
  * it is not introducing worker 's cooperatives , and coops are socialist by nature . 
   capitalism assumes competition and unbiased law making . 
  that would be quite a lovely race to the bottom . 
  if you think socialism is a laugh , anarcho-capitalism is the biggest joke in the ideological book with absolutely zero basis in reality . 
   because the law makers or politicians for instance would definitely not get special treatment ? 
  why would they ? 
  if a politician committed a crime , he 'd get the same punishment as the dock worker does , not to mention the prestige of law makers is dramatically reduced given that all important decisions are made via direct democracy . 
   are you trolling ? 
  great response . 
  so you have nothing to say about how all the capital is gravitating towards the same organizations ? 
  this is the pretty basic concept of `` the 1 % '' , though that 's hardly extreme enough , it 's more the 0.1 % owning everything . 
   communism is good on paper but bad in practice . 
  totally unsubstantiated claim . 
   like capitalism is litterally the devil oh , i 'm sorry , i 'd hate to offend the local multimillionaire . 
  something tells me that if one thing is the root cause for the vast majority of bad things that have happened in the past ~ 200 years , i can safely say it 's a bad thing and we should want to get rid of it . 
   can you come up with arguments why capitalism should be abolished ? 
  preservation/increase of democracy and control of the people ( putting an end to oligarchy and plutocracy , created as a result of capitalism ) 2 . 
  reduction/elimination of social and economic inequality ( currently increasing as a result of capitalism ) 3 . 
  reducing/eliminating exploitation of third world countries ( currently increasing as a result of capitalism ) 4 . 
  stopping destruction of the enviornment ( currently ignored under capitalism ) 5 . 
  paying workers what they 're worth , either through reformation of the wage labour system or abolition of corporate hierarchy with the introduction of worker 's cooperatives ( a system proven to be effective ) . 
  capitalism by nature does not do or encourage any of this . 
  equal rights for all , regardless of social class , employment or race , gender , and religion . 
  prevent global economic stagnation 8 . 
  prevent global monopoly  totally what i said . 
  and this is * totally * what i said ;  saying `` hurr durr capitalism is litterally worse than stalin '' is ignorant . 
  not my fault you can not understand your own logic . 
   i totally said socialism is the worst ideology ever you 're the one that said communism was stupid . 
   i have n't heard one reasonable argument against the concept of capitalism . 
  depends on your definition of `` reasonable '' . 
  if you want to deny reality and statistics as empirically proven repeatedly over decades of study , then no , there is absolutely nothing wrong with capitalism at all . 
   saying `` hurr durr capitalism is litterally worse than stalin '' is ignorant saying `` hurr durr socialism is literally stalin '' is ignorant . 
  it 's late . 
  do you even know what socialism is ? 
  you should look up polandball . 
  mass immigration and the problems allegedly with it are a function of the system which we * all * , *** universally *** live in , no matter what part of the world we 're from . 
  and that system is an unjust system that benefits the elites at the expense of the enviornment and the people . 
  it should not be these immigrants that you or me or anyone else is angry at ; we should ** embrace ** these people . 
  what we should ** all ** be angry at , universally , is the system that forced this to happen ; ** capitalism ** . 
  and it is this system we should seek to change , not the immigration quota . 
  nothing new from the turkish government . 
  how long before tayyip is dealt with ? 
   the uk , comprising over 10 % of the eu population , has no representation in the governing party of the eu . 
  that 's entirely their own choice . 
  people are getting mad with the eu instead of getting mad with their politicians which are * making the choice * to keep out of government . 
  if the tories wanted into the epp tomorrow , they 'd get it , and they 'd be given a notable enough role while they 're at it . 
  of course , a woman spends her whole life working hard , and rising through the ranks in the system , but all of that will be superseded by whether or not she 's good looking . 
  europhile = someone interested in europe . 
  in terms of politics they 're two very different places . 
  they 're more contrarian than shitty . 
  he has a diametrically opposed world view . 
  we all know america can never be like europe because america is so much bigger with so many more people with so much diversity . 
  not really , no . 
  do you consider someone 's life fulfilled if all they can do with their life is afford shelter , food and drink and then do nothing else but go to and from work ? 
  no tv , no internet , no anything , just the three more-or-less universal fundamentals . 
  we should be talking about life fulfillment , not just what people need to keep breathing . 
  everything is expensive in ireland . 
  they 're cutting 6,070 $ per month are n't they ? 
   so , it is a big topic , not to `` paint russia as satan '' could 've fooled me and a lot of other people around here . 
  we get it . 
  russia is literally satan . 
  can we move on now ? 
  can we stop seeing the frontpage spammed with blatantly biased propaganda ? 
  please ? 
  i 'm glad i 'm not the only one who noticed [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=author%3agiggster&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on ), 
  that 's roughly 72,000 $ per year per mep . 
  is that in response to the riots ? 
  why should european firms have to pay for * american * violations of sanctions on countries which are not our enemies ? 
  states like cuba hold no ill will towards european states or european interests . 
   what got teaches us about ~ ~ the struggle for the ec presidency ~ ~ politics, 
  yeah , spain , ireland , portugal and italy definitely have no catholic population . 
  of course , finland , lithuania , czech republic , estonia , latvia , hungary , bulgaria and slovenia all being below the eu average is just an abnormality ... 
  those are two separate issues . 
  this is not data protection , it 's removing specific links from turning up on the search to stop us users finding out information easily . 
  it falls on google to deal with it , the same way it fell on youtube to deal with dmca takedown requests ; in short , they take down everything automatically on request because the demand was far too high to deal with it on a case by case basis . 
  i have one problem with this whole deal ; that it puts the onus on ** google ** ( and other search engines ) instead of the websites hosting the information . 
  it 's dumb as fuck to centralize all the requests , there 'll be millions and it 'll become the new dmca takedowns on youtube . 
  they have to go with a candidate . 
  if they do not , they give up pretenses of democratic legitimacy .
