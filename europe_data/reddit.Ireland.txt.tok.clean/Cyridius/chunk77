  in the live debates , each and every one of the candidates * insisted * that there would be no other commission president than the people standing on that stage . 
  the voter turnout was abysmal this year , and that was with a very thorough , all-guns-blazing media campaign , and with a new policy that voting has more say . 
  it would be a *** lie *** from * all sides * if a non-party candidate was put forward . 
  if merkel wants to be buddy buddy with cameron , fine by me , but do n't squander my fucking vote to do it . 
  i , for one , would want no part of a european union that does that , and in future elections - both european and national - i would be giving my vote to eurosceptics . 
  stewart lee had an amazing video on this but it appears to have been taken down for copyright infringement . 
  yeah , that 's what i meant . 
  the severe weakening of labour in westminster could lead to another party rising . 
  space is the new frontier and we 're all looking for a new america out there . 
  it 's an exciting time to live in . 
  at least it opens up the way for ukip !, 
  if you 're trying to show wealth spread , gdp per capita a ` int the best one . 
  ~ ~ we ~ ~ they may have more gdp per capita , but the inequality gap is far smaller ( though increasing ) . 
  5 star movement has gone over to lepen iirc, 
  yeah and a decade ago they were upset about the polish . 
  and a few decades before that it was the indians and the pakistanis . 
  i believe so . 
  0.2 % of our population ? 
  i a ` int worried . 
  it 's incredibly hard to find actual numbers on it though . 
  i think total migration is something over a million a year , though by nature it 's very difficult to tell with illegal immigrants . 
   i assert that other than scientific and technological advances , the majority of `` change '' in the last 25 years ( the last ~ 200 years , really ) is the kind that should be resisted , not welcomed . 
  so , other than the end of slavery , woman 's suffrage , equal rights regardless of race , gender and creed , healthcare , a welfare state ( proven to dramatically improve everybody 's life ) , and so on , should * all * be resisted ? 
  what the fuck are you smoking ? 
  and that 's not even bringing in the massive social shifts that technology brings . 
  that 's not the same thing at all . 
  women 's suffrage , civil rights , so on and so forth , are not things you can hold the same opinion on for decades on end . 
  a party that maintains apartheid is a good policy and does not change on that for `` democratic legitimacy '' is just a joke . 
  parties can , do , and will change stances on issues as information becomes available , their party membership changes , and the world changes . 
  that 's simply how it works . 
  there 's a *** radical *** difference between that , and a party running , * today * , for an election * tomorrow * and going back on all of its promises once in office . 
  with the former , you know what the stances are and that the opinions have changed , with the latter they flat out lied to you . 
  it 's xkenq , he 's the local xenophobic , racist , misogynist far right mascot around here . 
  what 's worrying is that he has positive karma , so someone out there agrees with what he says . 
  yes , women 's suffrage , such a hot topic . 
  ukip and fn are not the same party . 
   vlaams belang ( the extreme right-wing party you talked about ) has a very socialist economical programme can you summarize it for me please ? 
  the camps were not just for jews ; in fact they were there primarily for political prisoners and social undesirables - at first . 
  the main plan for hitler was to , as comical as it sounds , deport the jews to madagascar ( then a french colony , but would be handed over to the germans for administration ) where they would no longer be a problem for him . 
  that was the plan , but due to germany 's failure to defeat britain , they went with extermination instead . 
  we had on and off war with a foreign force for about 800 years , no big deal , we only had french , english , spanish , italian , dutch , scottish and god knows how many other armies fighting its way through here at one point or another . 
  see , what your little fairy tale where western europe was somehow magically at peace for the past few thousand years has forgotten , is that ireland is and always has been an extremely important strategic location and its always been a point of conflict . 
  the british only threatened to invade us twice during world war ii , not a big deal i suppose . 
  see , your question is fucking moronic . 
  this is n't a dick swinging contest , grow the fuck up . 
  seriously , `` how many times has ireland being invaded '' ? 
  how old are you ? 
  i 've said this before and i 've said this again , poland is as much part of europe as ireland is , and yes i would be willing to fight for it . 
  which is specifically why i 'm not a bloodthirsty , moronic warmonger . 
  what fantasy world do you live in where war is an even remotely pleasant possibility ? 
  anyone with a modicum of common fucking sense should avoid any kind of warpath and continue to use economic coercion and diplomacy . 
  putting people in power who can do nothing but take their dick out and try and measure it against putin is fucking stupid . 
  poland is not in danger . 
  simple as that . 
  get your head out of the clouds and back to reality . 
  you 're fabricating danger . 
  if poland is ever in danger , every single country in the baltic region is in danger , and as such there will be no danger of inaction . 
  they are as likely to run into trouble as we are . 
  that does n't mean we are in danger , that means poland is not . 
  simple version ; eu commission proposes legislature it goes to a parliament committee that discusses and has a smaller vote on it european parliament votes on it . 
  other than that it is functionally more or less the same as any other parliament , with its own political parties ( in the form of groups ) and its own chairman ( known at president of the european parliament , last time it was martin schulz ) . 
  ghettos as a temporary solution , yes . 
  hitler 's plans for the jews were to deport them all the madagascar where they could n't bother germany anymore . 
  when war broke out , he obviously could n't do that , and simply shooting them was considered inefficient ( and traumatizing for the soldiers ordered to do it ) so in january 1942 , wannsee conference , and we know the rest . 
  they 're as likely to run into trouble as we are . 
  stop being dramatic you think we would n't be effected by your fantasy war ? 
  us , a country with a huge polish population ? 
  us , with a very significant british presence on our island ? 
  we 're a part of the american logistical network , where do you think they stop over on the way to iraq ? 
  every time there 's a world war , we go off to fight . 
  so do n't think we 're some passive , weak , isolated little island . 
  a warhawk creates problems that can only be solved with war , he does not fix problems with diplomacy . 
  more solutions , less warmongering, 
  i personally find it hard to believe cocaine is the leading stimulant * anywhere * . 
  it 's expensive as fuck . 
  a true drug of the upper middle class . 
  i laugh how it highlighted and zoomed in on malta just to tell us it had no data . 
  not comparable . 
  the rise of fascism was not a world shaking event . 
  it was notable , but countries were being led by monarchies for centuries , fascism was essentially more of the same , but with different emphasis . 
  nobody could have predicted the holocaust , so trying to play that card gets you nowhere . 
  in fact , the outbreak of war is what started the holocaust , due to the influx of jews from the polish territory that was annexed . 
  but that 's aside the main point . 
  britain and france were not in a fit state to fight a war against germany , a heavily militarized nation . 
  the two states had just started recovering from a massive economic crisis and the strength disparity in military capabilities between the french + british and the germans was huge , especially as we got closer to the outbreak of war . 
  the remilitarization of the uk was n't really fully complete even by 1940 . 
  and then , we have to take into account that there was a very large amount of sympathizers . 
  not just on the hand of fellow fascists in france and britain , but we have to remember that german actions were , by and large , seen as a rebellion against what was regarded widely as a punitive , extreme peace negotiation . 
  many leading political figures and generals at the time saw the versailles treaty as a prelude to another war . 
  then we have the stalinist elements within the populations which created political instability , simply because of the molotov-ribbentrop pact , and they essentially took their orders from moscow . 
  in france this was very apparent , even in the middle of the war , when the germans instigated operation barbarossa , the french resistance had a huge influx from the communists , who until then had done nothing . 
  it was only around the push for the annexation of the sudetenland and the later full annexation of czechoslovakia that people started to realize germany was after far more than its simple traditional holdings . 
  the `` peace in our time '' speech was a farce , chamberlain knew it . 
  it was chamberlain who declared war when the nazis invaded poland . 
  he only resigned after the norway invasion was repelled , as it was a huge blow to not only british morale , but british capabilities in the region . 
  so , when you 're talking about `` warhawks '' in the 1930s having been beneficial ? 
  it would have only changed things for the worst . 
  warhawks is what caused the versailles treaty , and that 's a very large part of what caused the rise of nazism in germany . 
  there needs to be a fine balance between diplomacy , economic coercion , and intimidation . 
  war should always be , *** always *** be , the very final option , and it should n't be something you threaten without the intent of going to war to start with , because countries have in the past , and can do again , simply talk themselves into wars that could 've been averted .
