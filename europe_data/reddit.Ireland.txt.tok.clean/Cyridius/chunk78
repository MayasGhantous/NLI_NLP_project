   the first article is about sub-african immigrants in morocco . 
  it points out that moroccan government treats their immigrants badly . 
   the second article is again about african immigrants who comes to morocco , not actual moroccan poverty or ill treatment . 
   the third article is again about sub african immigrants and not the state of their wellbeing in their home countries . 
   the fourth is about immigrants being treated like garbage , again not their wellbeing in their home countries . 
   the fifth is again about how the moroccan government treat immigrants . 
   none of your articles says that any of the immigrants are poor or they 're fleeing war . 
  you know full well this is as a result of europe *** paying *** morocco to do this . 
  and you clearly know very little about the state of africa , and you blatantly ignored articles that mentioned specifically war and violence . 
  here , let me link it to you ; http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2007/09/05/19443/moroccan-crackdown-strands-african.html there are currently ** 15 ** conflicts going on in africa , 5 of which are going consistently 1000 + deaths per year . 
  1 of those 5 is in north africa , 1 is somalia ( which we all like to forget about ) , and the other 3 are subsharan countries , the primary source of immigrants . 
  but sure , none of them are fleeing from war . 
  / s you think wealthy people risk their lives to emigrate here ? 
  i 'm not trying to be mean , but that is fucking retarded . 
  i a ` int gon na deny wealthy people are emigrating , but they 're going to do it safe and legally , because we do n't turn away people with money . 
   which is ? 
  why are you so mad about people who want to help them in their own countries ? 
  sorry , i value these people over the state of the economy . 
  it 's not like we have a welfare state to take care of the unemployed or anything , that would be a crazy idea . 
   if you really want to help these people you volunteer there . 
  my parents would also have been some of the people you * de facto * condemned to death on the other side of the border , but fuck them right , i guess they just ran shit out of luck because they were born on the wrong side of the mediterranean . 
   we have doctors without borders and engineers without borders already and that 's a huge progress . 
  doing very little in the long term . 
  great organizations , utmost respect to them , but they 're not going to realistically fix much . 
  they do amazing work , and they can help small communities , but that 's not doing anything to develop a country infrastructurally and it 's not creating jobs . 
   if we take in the people who try we 're going to need to spend more and more resources in our own countries and less and less in the developing nations . 
  we spend jack shit on developing nations . 
  we bribe governments to do what we like to suit our corporate interests . 
  for example , nigeria 's main source of income in the long term is going to be oil exports . 
  which we 're encouraging because it means cheaper prices for us . 
   your demands are unrealistic . 
  no they 're not . 
  okay , maybe they are a little , but if we stuck to `` unrealistic '' ideas , we 'd never get anywhere . 
  we should be striving to make these ideas a reality , not sitting by and saying `` it 's too much '' . 
   the economy will decline with a lot of immigrants where 's your proof of this ? 
  i see this getting thrown around a lot ; where is the proof influx of immigrants is directly correlated to economic downturn ? 
  it is n't . 
  people have been mass immigrating to europe for decades and we 've went through several boom-bust cycles , and you know what ? 
  immigrants did n't cause a single one of those . 
  every time we talk about eu enlargement some people harp on about all the immigrants . 
  you know what , the polish have been moving around europe for a decade now , and unless you want to pin the eurocrisis on polish immigrants , then those claims seem pretty unsubstantiated to me . 
   segrigation and cultural conflicts this , this i can understand . 
  large , uncontrolled influxes of immigrants into a single country will cause this problem . 
  but we 're 28 countries . 
  why are we not able to diffuse the immigrant population amongst all of our memberstates , using economic strength , size and population as metrics for who gets how much ? 
   ireland was once a very poor nation but it built itself up we built ourselves up because we all emigrated and sent the money we earned in other countries back home which stimulated the economy . 
  and we also had the european union constantly pumping money into the country . 
  the eu has not taken on anywhere close to similar level of investment in a non-eu state , and i do n't expect it to unless it suits its interests specifically . 
   no you 're saying that everyone who do n't agree with you are heartless scum . 
  i 'm not going to say they 're heartless . 
  that would be an exaggeration . 
  but i 'm not going to say that it 's not flat out , a wrong thing to do and it is an extremely poor set of priorities we have if we 're going to toss out people who can , in the long term , lead to a net contribution to the countries they both live in and the countries they are coming from , because some right wing parties have scared us with baseless rhetoric . 
   surely the us would gladly help if needed . 
  the public would not be glad . 
  there is a very large anti war sentiment in the us and people are driving increasingly towards isolationism . 
  nato holds a very important framework which would oblige the us to go to war . 
  this is why america stations troops in europe ; both as rapid response , but also to justify to the public that if a european country is being attacked , its troops are * also * being attacked and therefore america has to respond . 
  the long and short of this is ; yeah , * maybe * the eu can handle defense on its own , but there is absolutely no logical reason we would cut out several allies which we are on good terms with , just for the sake of it . 
   but , would n't you like to see that reigned in ? 
  it would be a sham . 
  anything the us wants to interfere in , it will interfere in , removing them from a military alliance ( or dissolving the alliance , which would leave out countries like canada as well ) does n't do us any favours . 
  nato is a military union . 
  it has hierarchy , streamlined organization , independent chains of command that can kick the wheels into motion in a very efficient manner . 
  they have the entire framework and decades of experience . 
  the eu is a fledgling economic union which extreme amounts of internal dissent . 
  it 's a bureaucratic mess . 
  using the cdsp for example , it requires a meeting of the european council and unanimous agreement of all member states , and as the eu expands , that will become an even more bogged down process , as individual states can and will look after their interests first . 
  when countries join nato , they * explicitly * join nato , there is no other baggage attached to it . 
  it is military , pure and simple . 
  if we were to militarize the european union , you * will * have to shove it down people 's throats , because it adds tonnes of baggage to the union that individual states may not actually want . 
  there are more than a few nations in the eu that are not nato members ( sweden , finland , ireland , austria , off the top of my head ) and they are not in nato for a reason . 
   do you have a source or are you just guessing ? 
  second half of it ? 
  common sense . 
  poor people , big desert , hostile government , what the hell do you think is going to happen to them ? 
  first half ?

  people in europe are so god damn worried about economic effects that they forget the extremely more important human element to this problem . 
  these people are running from persecution , ethnic cleansing , civil war , murder , tyranny , and abject poverty in order to have an opportunity of living . 
  not living well , * living * . 
  where are our european values ? 
  why are these people denied rights that we demand for ourselves and take as granted , simply based on accident of birth ? 
  these people are living , breathing human beings , and they * deserve * the same rights as we do , and that includes personal safety , and the right to the pursuit of happiness . 
  and that is not and * should not * ** ever ** be based on any other metric than the fact that they * are * living , breathing human beings . 
   this argument is so bad . 
  `` let them in or you 're litterally the devil '' , i mean really ? 
  so , when people say this to me ? 
  all i can say is , ** yes , really ** . 
   the eu would not rush to their aid if the russians tried to pull a crimea move ? 
  realistically ? 
  probably not , no . 
  the eu is a fragile community . 
  not a military alliance . 
  it has the cdsp , but that is not a hardline military pact . 
  nato is . 
  clearly serbia did not get a large enough dose of freedom . 
  the us does not need nato to meddle in our affairs . 
   i believe that europe is now fully capable of defending itself . 
  it is n't . 
  we have the numbers , we have the technology , but we do n't have the logistics .
