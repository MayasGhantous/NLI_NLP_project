  yeah , you do n't need to be a fascist to be a giant piece of shit . 
  furthermore , all the aspects of fascism that everyone here give a fuck about are the ones blatantly apparent in fn ( and other eurocynic parties ) such as unapologetic racism and blatant ultranationalism , both of which are integral parts of fascist ideology and give fascism legitimacy . 
  imagine fn gets government in france tomorrow . 
  will the nazi party be so extreme anymore ? 
  pretend that statement was a complete fabrication . 
  he is still a rabid holocaust denying , ultranationalist , xenophobic , racist piece of shit . 
  france gave ultranationalists 25 % of their vote in the eu elections , putting them first . 
  hah , look at those losers in italy , not voting extremist !, 
  the northern irish get very mad about their flags . 
  yeah , the kulaks who killed are their produce and hid all the grain stock and massively exacerbated food shortage leading to a famine ? 
  such good guys , if you ask me . 
  kulaks were n't wealthy middle class , they were landowners who resisted collectivism . 
  oh , absolutely , socialism has drastically changed over the last few decades . 
  revolutionary socialism used to be far more prevailent , as well , and i suppose communists today probably fill that niche . 
  it 's not as much of a simplification as you think . 
  simplification , yes , but not by too much . 
  socialists and communists , broadly speaking , are in the same camp . 
  communists will , 9/10 times , follow the same route of socialists , but will want to take it a step further . 
  socialists , not always , but a lot ( if not most ) of the time , see socialism as a natural evolution , and as such communism as a natural evolution . 
  in nuance , both sides are different , but in practicality , until we reach a socialist society , the vast majority of communists and socialists can be referred to as one in the same . 
  there are some communists crazy enough to think we can simply skip socialism , but meh . 
  i do n't think we can agree with that , no . 
  in most countries , parties advocating violence are swiftly banned . 
   there no longer is a struggle of the classes , the working class is no longer suffering and oppressed . 
  socialists disagree very strongly with that statement . 
  capitalism is inherently exploitative , people 's livelihoods are dependent on capitalists , therefore the workers are suffering exploitation . 
   compared with other parts of the world or the european past , everyone is really wealthy and compared to shit , anything can taste good . 
   todays problems are different . 
  and the answer for todays problems is not the answer the left is able to give right now . 
  how so ? 
   and thus , they fail at elections . 
  tell that to the likes of sinn f\u00e9in and syriza . 
  far left parties everywhere are getting stronger , if not in the voting polls than with grass roots support , and as voter apathy maintains , these parties will be able to attract larger voting bases that * will * go out and vote for them in elections . 
   all the far left parties i know of advocate a violent overthrow . 
  no they do n't . 
  they call for a radical change . 
  the method of achieving this is widely varied amongst parties . 
  quite a few are reformist parties who believe they can change things from running within the currently existing political system and getting a majority . 
  others believe the system is inherently against them and do not trust this , this is revolutionary socialism . 
  there are different forms of socialism . 
  many , many different forms , and the far left is fond of splitting up over these differences . 
  for example , in ireland with have the socialist party like i said , which subscribed to trotskyism ( `` communist '' ideology ) , and then we have the communist party of ireland which follows marxism-leninism . 
  the problem here is that you 're seeing `` communist '' and `` socialist '' as two different ideologies . 
  they 're the same . 
  but within this there are dozens of branches that will cause splits . 
  and they ca n't all call themselves the socialist party . 
  and many communist parties are old and left over from the cold war when `` communist '' was also a name very much in vogue for socialist movement . 
  if you ever read the literature of some communist parties , most of them describe themselves as socialists . 
   but they need to find a way to make it compatible with the realities of the modern society . 
  socialism is n't supposed to be compatible with the modern society , it 's meant to supplant it with a socialist one . 
  that 's the whole point . 
  modern society is capitalists . 
  socialists want out of this society and into a socialist society . 
  any deviation in order to make it more compatible with modern society is simply an ideological betrayal . 
  the closest think you 'll get is democratic socialism . 
  if you want to break an anti-right wing circle jerk , just say you 're a socialist . 
  / r/europe is a decent example of what modern politics is like . 
  everyone is afraid of both extremes and are clinging so tight to the centre that anything that deviates is inherently bad . 
  socialism , to the surprise of many , is the same as communism when we 're talking politics . 
  communists is just the name attached , `` jus cus '' . 
  communism is the final form of the state of society that ( most ) socialists want to achieve , socialism is the transition stage , thus , socialist parties . 
  for example , the socialist party i am a member of in ireland is trotskyite-democratic socialist . 
  anarchism is a strange one , simply because it has diverged so much . 
  up until recent years , anarchism would be pretty much synonymous with libertarian socialism/anarcho-socialism , but now you have even more crazy shit like anarcho-capitalism and all that kind of stuff . 
  so , if we 're using the more accurate square table ( which i think *** by far *** is the best table for displaying the differences in socialist ideology ) , anarchism is the bottom half of the table , but can vary between the left and right parts quite significantly . 
  you would n't get killed for being well off middle class . 
  you 'd get your assets seized for being a businessman . 
  if you resisted you might get killed , yeah , but the vast , vast , vast majority of the population will not get their shit taken from them . 
  meh , there 's a lot of stigma against socialists left over from the cold war . 
  i tend to avoid discussing it when eastern europeans are active in threads because they 'll jump down your throat due to their ignorance of how broad socialism is . 
  and then they 'll ignore you when you tell them what socialism is about and then explain that the beliefs i hold are n't real . 
  so , i 've come to the conclusion that you 're all fascists / s, 
  by `` update their economic concepts '' you mean `` throw away centuries of firmly held economic ideology and totally gut the core concept of their party '' ? 
  the golden dawn . 
  but we should be afraid of the lefties , right gaiz ? 
   sure , but the far left bash anyone who disagrees with their economic policy . 
  yes , people to tend to bash people who ideologically disagree with them . 
   the extreme left advocate violence just as much as the extreme right the far left advocates radical change . 
  the method by which it is done is not a unified stance amongst the left . 
  american libertarians hijacked the term . 
  libertarian socialists are essentially anarcho-communists which is as far left as you can go . 
  democratic socialists are the same . 
  greens tend to be far left on the spectrum , but it is n't a guarantee . 
  rad . 
  social democrats can be considered far left . 
  socialists are about as far left as you can go . 
  social democrats are centre-left , but radical social democracy can also be considered far left . 
  yeah , we should really value the input of a bunch of retards that are telling everyone who is n't white to go back to bumfuckistan . 
  fuck the golden dawn . 
  and *** fuck *** all their supporters , they are the absolute antithesis of what europe is , and everyone that believes these parties have anything worth adding other than fearmongering , racism , holocaust denial , and xenophobia should go fuck themselves . 
  and that 's not even getting started on their non-racial ideological ** bullshit ** , all of their science , climate , and rights records are so abysmal that if all their supporters dropped dead this moment i would n't shed a single fucking tear when i awake the next morning to find the collective iq of the human race has gone up radically and problems might actually start getting solved . 
  i 'm not denying that front national , ukip and everyone like them , are racist , xenophobic , ultranationalist pieces of shit , no . 
  yeah , i 'm the cunt , not the far right ultranationalists who hate foreigners but are n't actually racist , right ? 
  shut the fuck up . 
  we did n't fight a world war to give pieces of shit a chance to do it all over again . 
  every true believer of democracy should use every tool at their disposal to silence , demonize and marginalize far right closet fascists at every possible turn . 
  both sides of my family fought the nazis in north africa and europe . 
  more than enough of them died fighting it . 
  and after that most of them who survived died fighting israel . 
  they 'd all be turning in their graves right now to see this bullshit rising in europe again , and i do n't want to have anothet war to preserve the ideals they died for .
