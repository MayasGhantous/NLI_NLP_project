  regardless of us being heavily influenced by the us , i do n't think you could say we 're * dominated * , mostly because there has n't been a situation where european and us interests have been legitimately add odds ... yet . 
  absolutely . 
  we should always be skeptical . 
  i always thought `` euroskeptic '' was a bit of a misnomer , personally , `` eurocynic '' might be a bit more accurate . 
  most of the good vodka is n't actually russian , anyways . 
  but yeah , +1 sanctions . 
  congratulations on being part of the problem . 
  enjoy your new tag . 
  execution of pows would be the stupidest thing they could do . 
  it will turn the population against them . 
  and is n't that a fucking war crime ? 
  there 'll never be an open conflict with russia , so , yeah . 
  the european union is a single institution , not 28 joined institutions . 
  as such , the european union , as a single institution , encompasses all 28 member states , in the same manner the united states , as a single institution , encompasses all 50 states of america . 
  i think most countries have a citizen test ? 
  i do n't get that joke . 
  the florida man one . 
  i love ` straya ( do i fit in now ? 
  ) , and i 've been somewhat keeping up with ozpolitic , as i like to call it , and it 's just so unfortunate what the current gov is doing over there . 
  hopefully it 's as you say it is and their work gets undone next time around . 
  a * maoist * party in * belgium * ? 
  the fuck ? 
  the 12 stars would n't be something turkey would object to , jesus and the apostles are something islam very much believes in . 
  though i 'm speculating , i do n't know if that is the case or not . 
  little bit of a , little bit of b, 
  our police are unarmed . 
  we have several branches of armed police but they are only used in situations where they might be needed - hostages , armed robbery , drug bust etc. 
  all of which are extremely rare here . 
  ( edit : drug bust , not so rare ) the only time i can remember a garda ( garda is what we call police here , the force is `` an garda s\u00edoch\u00e1na '' i.e. 
  `` the guardians of peace '' ) shooting someone is during a bank robbery , oh , i dunno , a decade ago ? 
  it 's so rare it 's very difficult to find information on it . 
  while it happens , garda\u00ed are rarely shot . 
  they 're very highly respected here . 
  s my d , allemagne , and bow before the glory of my ** 4.5 / 0.2 ** dl/ul internet . 
  the good news is that we might finally get 100mbps fibre optic out here in july . 
  you 're exaggerating , but you 're also not . 
  america is generally no more dangerous than most parts of europe to someone visiting . 
  you 're more likely to get stabbed in london than you are in new york . 
  but the justice system is pretty shitty ( so is the irish one , but in a different way ) . 
  this is due largely to privatized prison systems , which is not something we would have to worry about . 
  you really should have bolded the rest of the sentence ; ** if the police shoot at a person [ they ] should seek to only temporarily incapacitate the person . 
  the shots will be primarily directed against the legs , ** *** but if circumstances warrant , the police shoot directly against the body *** the distinction is important . 
  in america , lethal force is immediately authorized if the cop 's life is endangered . 
  it appears in sweden , lethal force is only authorized when absolutely all other options have been expended . 
  the whole `` shoot for the legs '' thing does n't make much sense taken on its own . 
  especially seeing as major arteries that will cause you to bleed to death if they 're hit are located in the legs , and it 's nigh on impossible in a high stress situation to shoot a moving target in the legs ( coming from someone with experience shooting , it 's very difficult to hit moving targets even under controlled circumstances ) . 
  so , the second half of that sentence makes the whole thing much more realistic . 
  this is so british . 
  helicopters do not give you that much of an advantage against a professional military . 
  what 's so illegitimate about it ? 
  it wo n't stop , either . 
  if you removed freedom of movement , they 'd simply come in the long way . 
  and no country will turn back doctors . 
  this can only be fixed in the host countries . 
  doctors leave because they 're getting paid shit for long hours , poor working conditions and they feel they deserve better . 
  france 's sarkozy can suck my balls . 
  castle doctrine is orientated towards personal safety . 
  makes some sense , surely if someone is in your house illegally they 're not there to give you a hug ? 
  by the way , defense laws are so varied in europe there are multiple versions of the castle law on several european countries . 
  in fact the american one was first drafted from the british ones . 
  ... and dear god no . 
  meh , it 's not just our taxes and so on . 
  if that were the case , there are other places in europe to go . 
  we 've a pretty solid working force for the tech industry . 
  all the companies that are present here have convinced the youth to go into tech related education and get jobs in the tech field . 
  while i have no doubt our taxes do play a significant part , there 's more than enough legitimate tech jobs here that we should n't be ashamed about it . 
   which happen not to be the pro-eu parties . 
  that 's not true . 
  murder when it comes to defending property is pretty subjective opinion wise . 
  woah , people , what 's with the downvotes ? 
  i did n't say * i * thought that, 
  well , we are capitalists , and imperialists , but it 's not like russia and china a ` int either ... 
  the only side i 'm on is that of the people , personally !, 
  as much as i dislike fn , it 's far removed from the party under her father . 
  fuck the ttip . 
  of all the times to say something racist , saying it while being robbed by the subject of your racism is probably the most acceptable . 
  it was about the accuracy of the source . 
  there 's a very , *** very *** big difference between aggravated assault with a weapon and someone getting punched in the face so hard their eye socket was fractured - which by the way is a far less serious injury than a knife in the face , albeit with a possibility of severe damage if fractured in a certain way and not treated properly . 
  that was n't even close to being the object of discussion , and you know that . 
  it is n't even remotely the same as getting stabbed in the face . 
  that 's just scummy as fuck, 
  they 're profiting from the european institution while harping on about how evil it is . 
  that 's pure hypocrisy . 
  if they were so dedicated they would sit in abstention and not get that money in the first place . 
  you ca n't edit the title on reddit . 
  dae think western powers are the only ones capable of evil ? 
   not generally , economically . 
  there is no differential . 
  one can not be economically far-left without being a socialist or communist ( or anarchist ) , those are economics-based ideologies . 
   there is n't a straight line from the far left to the far right , by your logic all far right parties would be fascists . 
  broadly speaking , there is . 
  that 's why there is such a thing as `` far left '' or `` far right '' , because there is a broad scale and each term is reserved for extremities . 
  fascism ( aka corporatism ) , national socialism , and ultranationalism are all far right . 
  communism and socialism are all far left . 
  anything that is not those is in between . 
  far right/left is supposed to be used specifically to denote those ideologies . 
  far right/far left are also known as radical right and radical left . 
  your left wing party can not be radical because it supports the current political framework . 
  but other than this , i understand completely what you 're saying , this is really a discussion of semantics , when we get right down to it . 
  your party is relatively far left , that 's fine then .
