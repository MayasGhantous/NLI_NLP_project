  is it private just because he says it is ? 
  what about meetings between politicians or civil servants ? 
  what about a million and one different things . 
  the whole idea that one can simply litigate against a body like google because it displays the results of a search not only makes the search engine totally untrustworthy and functionally ineffective , but it is a major breach in freedom of expression . 
  and no , expressing myself and then nobody being able to see or hear it is not `` freedom of expression '' . 
   but citizens of member states should n't be pigeonholed into a situation in which they became members of a federation without even realizing , let alone consenting to , such an action . 
  this is the crux of the issue . 
  any and all moves towards further european integration ( or even disintegration - i.e. 
  any treaty changes or new treaties ) should be done by direct democracy - popular vote . 
  this is the only way we can actually instill trust in the giant bureaucratic hole that is the eu . 
  the eu commission should be abolished/merged into the european parliament . 
  the european council is supposed to represent the interests of the member states , let it behave similarly to 2 ^ nd chamber . 
  it does n't matter who does it . 
  i agree with you in a broad sense , but at what point can you say something is/is not a socialist policy . 
  the vast majority of us support it . 
  maybe not an ideologically socialist policy , but it is a policy very much championed by democratic socialists . 
  federalization is on the agenda , even for politicians , yes . 
  that is what is at the end of the road for european integration , the same as it was for the united state when they became independent . 
  probably not without getting smaller , no . 
  let 's be realistic ; the differences between east and west are far too large . 
  the living standard in bulgaria is nothing compared to , say , the uk . 
  how are these two countries meant to be in a union without taking all the money from one country and dumping it into the other ? 
  which wont happen . 
  the european union in the future will be a union of inequality . 
  to me , that is not `` working '' . 
  regardless , i support the eu in hopes that it will change and adopt policies to address this problem . 
  it 's something largely supported by american socialists because in the us , minimum wage is not considered a `` living wage '' and therefore has to be increased in order to allow the workers to live on minimum wage from a single job . 
  when did they lift the marriage bar again ? 
  say what you want about the church , but the nuns ran their hospitals better than the government, 
  worker 's rights + wages , and enhancement/reformation of european battlegroups . 
  did you read the article at all ? 
  the drinks are banned on basis of caffeine content , and guess what , most coffee does n't make the cut . 
   for minors . 
  of course , do minors really need to drink coffee ? 
  when i was in final year of highschool i did , yes . 
  i was still 17 for a significant portion of 1st year in university . 
  the student life in late high school and in uni involves a lot of work and more than enough times if you want to enjoy your life it means sacrificing a few hours of sleep here and there . 
  they should be banning drinks based on sugar content , not caffeine . 
  this law does n't make any god damn sense otherwise . 
  not to mention the `` gateway drug '' argument has been used for decades in relation to other substances and , really , it 's pretty much bullshit . 
  damn corporate thugs . 
  too bad they 're doing it under an oligarch 's orders and not their own free will . 
  the power should be in the hands of the workers , not some fat cat . 
  yes , you are right , i confused monolithic with mesolithic . 
  yes , you are absolutely correct . 
  i confused mesolithic with monolithic . 
   by my argument they ca n't if all parties involved in the act at the heart of the suit are dead . 
  if even a single slave owner or slave was still alive then make a case by all means . 
  but these are *** state *** lawsuits , it has nothing to do with the people alive , it has everything to do with exploitation of the people in order to use their labour to harvest resources and ship them back to the colonial overlord . 
  the former colony never saw the fruit of those labours in the form of investment into the country , education , infrastructure , and so on and so forth , and as such they are seeking those benefits , which is , if you read it , what the lawsuit is for . 
  these are things that transcend a single human life . 
  they are not looking for personal , monetary compensation for the people . 
  they are looking for state structures like hospitals , schools , roads , and so on . 
  their requests are reasonable and almost entirely humanitarian/nation building in nature . 
   but there has to be a line drawn somewhere or the vatican is liable to be sued for every crusade it sanctioned . 
  yes , the line is drawn at colonialism . 
  the crusades and colonialism are not equatable . 
  if a man robs a bank , and hands everything off to his son , does the son keep the money ? 
  citizens are paying for shit that is not their fault * all the time * . 
  it is the state being sued , not the people . 
  and believe it or not , the state of the united kingdom is the same one that bought and sold slaves , it is not a different one , it is a direct continuation . 
  by your argument , * nobody * can ** ever ** sue the state . 
  i was n't born in egypt . 
  racist fucktard . 
  go back to / pol / with the other 12 year olds . 
  something something illuminati something something lizard people, 
  um , native civilizations were not monolithic . 
  backward as fuck in a lot of ways . 
  but definitely not anywhere near stone age . 
  i prefer `` stormfront or reddit ? 
  '' , list of comments and you have to guess which site it 's from, 
  the icc in relation to world powers is an ineffective organization and might as well not exist . 
  any of the big human rights offenders with notable power and influence - say china , russia , israel and the us - would never let a single citizen be locked away by the icc . 
  they would n't extradite , and on the off chance they ended up in the hague , half of them would probably bust them out . 
  hell , it 's even law in the us . 
  did n't take long for muslim immigrants to come up . 
  racists are predictable as fuck . 
   we should still keep it calm as much as we can . 
  that 's exactly what you * should n't * do . 
  governments respond to , and have only ever responded to , violence . 
  if the government is capitulating to you without violence , then it is because you are threatening violence , either explicitly or implicitly . 
  it 's an indian reality tv show . 
  she 's meant to verbally goad them into responding . 
  the contestants know this . 
  however , she broke the rules and hit him , and , annoyed by this , the guy hit her back . 
  and then ... how can she slap ? 
  what 's confusing me is that unemployed youth are not turning to communism . 
  i guess fascists are just better at politics ? 
   that 's 8 countries . 
  out of how many now , 56 is it ? 
  that would actually be 8 out of 11 . 
  if you were n't so busy being dumb as fuck you might 've been able to read . 
  i 'm not going to dignify a racist 0-day troll account . 
  most of western europe was involved in colonization . 
  portugal , france , spain , uk , italy , germany , netherlands , belgium ... 
  it 's not a question , it 's a fact , and most of those countries that they colonized , primarily africans , are still suffering as a result . 
  it is n't ? 
  i honestly do n't think european left will adopt an austerity policy , it 's fundamentally contradictory to everything they stand for . 
  he had absolutely no presence, 
  no , there really was .
