  you said this was communist ideology , when it * factually * is not . 
  it is ussr imperialist policy . 
   i understand what communism is , and i like it in theory , but the world is n't clay that we can mold into an idea that someone forms . 
  but you do n't . 
  you know what stalinism is , maybe a bit of leninism and maoism , because it is those branches of communism that can possibly lead to dictatorship . 
  the rest of them are designed as ground-up movements which involve either dissolution of the state or extreme decentralization . 
   point proven . 
  i have n't lived in the gaza strip , so i wo n't take a fucking side . 
  you did n't * prove * anything . 
  all you did is show me that you have no capability for abstract thinking or empathy . 
   if you think people are too selfish and power hungry to live well in a capitalist society , how do you think they would do when a control system is put into place , and the only thing keeping the system running is good will and honesty ? 
  because it is n't just run on good will . 
  it 's run by a democracy and constitution . 
  secondly , when the vast majority of the population is benefiting , there 's no reason they would want to compromise it . 
  there 's a distinct difference between living in a society that encourages selfishness and exacerbates greed and one that focuses on community and sharing . 
   also , we already have effective capitalist systems in the world . 
  sure do !, 
  and i would nonetheless remove it , because even if the conditions in these capitalist systems were better than other capitalist systems , they 're still capitalist and still exploiting the workers . 
   the social-capitalism practiced by the germans , swedes , and french for example works well for who ? 
  the homeless ? 
  the working class barely scraping by ? 
  those living in the banlieues ? 
  maybe you should tell the people of greece that capitalism is their friend and that it only looks out for them . 
  maybe then they 'll forget that it was capitalism that brought this economic crash down on us and capitalism that implemented austerity . 
  `` just a few beatings , was n't that bad '' - simon stalin . 
   the problem with people like you is that you 're naive , and you always find reasons why the bad stuff about communism does n't count , and why the good stuff ( that you can get without communism ) does . 
  explain to me then , what are all the bad things *** communism *** brought you . 
  not the ussr , communism . 
  again , i repeat , *** not *** the ussr , *** communism *** . 
  i feel the emphasis again , not the *** ussr *** , *** communism *** , because it appears you are unable to tell the difference . 
   the problem with people like you is that you automatically assume that your form of thought is flawless and that everybody who does n't think like you is a `` problem '' . 
  no , the only `` problems '' are greedy capitalists ( though i suppose calling a capitalist `` greedy '' is just superfluous ) who 's sole goal in life is to exploit every other human being on the planet . 
  do you think the work place should be democratically managed between the people working in at every level , with all the profits shared evenly in according to contribution ? 
  if yes , congratulations , you 're a communist . 
  do you think jesus christ as portrayed in the bible was a good person ? 
  if yes , congratulations , you admire a communist . 
   the problem with people like you is that you obviously do n't know enough about the things you talk about if i knew nothing i 'd probably still know more than you about this . 
   because it was communism that dictated how the ussr would treat its occupied countries . 
  cite to me the book , publication , page number - preferably a direct quote - of any of the works by marx or engels that dictate that neighbouring countries must be subjugated and dominated as buffer states between the glorious revolution and the capitalists . 
  i 'll save you some time ; there is n't one . 
  you probably wont find one from lenin or trotsky either . 
  the policies which you so ignorantly claim are communist were ones developed by the ussr - a statist , imperialist , dictatorship . 
  you may be able to get away with claiming it 's stalinist and therefore communism , but try and be an open stalinist today and you 'll be derided among the radical left in almost all political discourse . 
   you have n't lived in a post-soviet country have you ? 
  i do n't need to live in a post-ussr country to know how to read and be educated . 
  it 's not that i think you 're an idiot , i just think you 're supremely ignorant of the ideology and your educational system and popular culture have just reinforced this ignorance as opposed to making you question what you think . 
   also , starting a response off with `` nope ! '', 
  already ends your argument , one would think an opening statement would start my argument , not end it . 
   just because you start off like a child . 
  hardly . 
  i start off with a statement of fact . 
  are the soviets an indication of what a people 's revolution looked like ? 
  ** nope ** . 
  according to the latest polls , sinn f\u00e9in is pretty much trying with fianna f\u00e1il . 
  i do n't even want to know the implications of that on a national level . 
  not reddit the organization , i doubt that , but if you wanted to start a grassroots social media campaign , reddit would n't be the worst place to start it off . 
  pretty shit logic because anyone with half a brain would be able to tell them that as soon as they criminalize it it 'll just open a deregulated black market industry and open up the way for far more abuse . 
   cultural marxism this seems to be the buzzword of people who are scared of change . 
  do you even know what cultural marxism is ? 
  i have him tagged as a troll account, 
  peace through superior firepower . 
  you 're lobbying for lobbyists to lobby for more lobbying right now . 
  i 'll have to pick up some of his works then , because i can definitely see the issues with communist movements - many people are just waiting for `` the revolution '' without actually realizing how terrible that all really is . 
  bloodthirstiness is a good word for it . 
  no but i 've read about him , from what i `` know '' he seems like a skeptic . 
  that 's not communism, 
   i am well aware that several u.s. states engage in this practice , is it even remotely beneficial ? 
  except their fiscal policy comes from the federal reserve . 
  why is n't tsipras in on this ? 
  anyways unfortunately i wont be able to watch it , i 'll have to get the next one . 
  euronews is not minor , it 's the most watched news channel on the continent . 
  `` romania poor '', 
  you have nothing on me op , last night my mom shut off the internet when i was playing xbox, 
  basic income is a short term capitalist solution , but in reality the only way i see the world improving over the next century is socialist revolution . 
  i do n't think the problem in particular with be unemployment , but that it will be the slow erosion of the middle class , widening gap of inequality and the fact that you 'll still be dirt poor because you 're not being paid shit . 
  there 'll always be reliable jobs in tech , and the `` problem '' is that most people already know this and the number of youth studying in tech-based degrees has been dramatically rising . 
  specialists are becoming more and more common in their given fields and as such are less and less valued . 
  why is a labourer dirt cheap ? 
  because you can toss him out at any time and bring in another . 
  and so it will be in the future for people with skilled education like mine . 
  and when today there 's a dozen people that hold the same wealth as 50 % of the population of the planet , it 's only getting worse as more of the wealth is getting sucked up by the same top 0.1 % and the inequality gap is increasing . 
   if the soviets were any indication of what a `` people 's revolution '' looked like nope !, 
  problem with you and people like you is all they see about communism is the ussr , despite the fact , for example , the limerick soviet is grassroots and marxist in nature , whereas the bolshevik revolution was leninist , stalin 's rule was stalinist , and after that it was crony capitalist under the guise of marxist-leninism . 
  not that i blame you for your views in the slightest , in stems from a poor history under the ussr and poor education on communist ideology ( which on the latter i definitely do n't blame anybody for , it 's really hard to sit down and read about it ) . 
  ignorance about communism 's diverse possibilities has more or less lead you to see it all as one block ; statist , centralised , communism . 
  whereas marx and most common mainstream communist thought is for decentralized democratic rule . 
  both lenin and mao staged communist revolutions in countries which have more or less been universally declared as unfit for communist revolution , and because of that they were forced to enact un-communist dictatorial rule . 
  i guess what i 'm trying to say is all stalinists and communists but not all communists are stalinist . 
  for example the eurocommunism branch specifically denied stalinist influence and after the prague spring many west european communist parties identified with that . 
  and i do n't hungarian communism would have been so bad had the ussr let things take their course and let hungarian communism take its course of natural evolution . 
  communism is n't what fucked your country , it was the ussr . 
  north korea officially renounced communism . 
  i thought that was more or less what the schengen did ; visa-free travel, 
  schengen now includes moldova ? 
  it 's god 's wrath for the other ones, 
  i posted an opinion poll here and it got downvoted . 
  long story short , sinn f\u00e9in is barely coming out on top , and they 're with gue/ngl ( radical left ) - as is the socialist party , which is doing poorly . 
  sinn f\u00e9in is slightly euroskeptic but not on the level of other parties like ukip etc here ; http://cdn1.independent.ie/incoming/article30220933.ece/91fb0/alternates/h342/poll+graphs+1.png http://cdn4.independent.ie/incoming/article30220934.ece/91fb0/alternates/h342/poll+graphs+2.png, 
  there was no free state at the time . 
  there was a very strong communist element to the revolution in ireland , but it never fostered into a socialist republic as the nationalist movement was dominated by more pragmatic leaders .
