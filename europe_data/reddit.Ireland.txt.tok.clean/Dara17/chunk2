  we have so many multinationals here that they can essentially write the rules , and when it comes to financial rules/regulations it 's the strangest & ugliest kind of [ transparent ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/finance-industry-won-key-tax-concessions-in-budget-1.1487724 ) - ^ [ r * ] ( https://pay.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1jxzch/finance_industry_won_key_tax_concessions_in/ ), 
  well , [ neelie kroes ] ( https://twitter.com/neeliekroeseu/status/357556288156205057 ) wants to make sure net neutrality is n't touched . 
   another democracy forced to pick between the shitty and the less shitty . 
  yeap , that summarises the last 15 years of irish politics too . 
  just the germans ? 
  how about the eu ? 
  i ca n't fathom how she 's held in any regard after the last 5 years of her stewardship of the eu 's downward spiral . 
  though the irony of a former east-german being part of a spy system greater than the stazi must be a bitter thing to accept . 
  god helps those who help themselves apparently . 
  from the final pre-negotiation report : http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/february/tradoc_150519.pdf `` the hlwg recommends that the united states and the eu seek to reach bilateral agreement on globally relevant rules , principles , or modes of cooperation in the following trade-related areas : \u2022 customs and trade facilitation : ensuring effective measures to facilitate trade between the two sides , with a level of ambition that goes beyond the disciplines under negotiation in the wto ; \u2022 competition policy \u2022 state-owned enterprises and other enterprises that benefit from special government-granted rights ; \u2022 ** localization barriers to trade : measures designed to protect , favor , or stimulate domestic industries , services providers , or intellectual property at the expense of imported goods , services , or foreign-owned or foreign-developed intellectual property ** \u2022 raw materials and energy \u2022 small - and medium-sized enterprises \u2022 transparency . '', 
  oh , i get a sinking feeling this will be used as a back-door acta and encourage the walmartification of the eu . 
  plus , i wish they spelt ` favor ' correctly . 
  i think this is a wise approach , until we can eat rating agencies , 
  no , but you 'd be amazed at the mistakes that get made ( formula and cell ) . 
  i 've seen people fired for less than those mistakes , -0.1 % to +2.2 % creates quite the policy difference . 
  i doubt it 's something professors keep their jobs with in many universities , it would n't last a week under an honest financial company audit . 
  statisticians are , it looks like some economists do n't always as odd as that seems . 
  then again , financial companies would n't exist without excel . 
  if everyday investors only knew how much of their life-savings depend on people being good & thorough with excel . 
  i try to be , but 5 years of austerity is enough experimentation . 
  it should have worked by now , if it was going to . 
  shame that does n't translate into decreased [ unemployment ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/unemployment-rate ) . 
   the debt ratio increased from 60 % to 90 % in 4 years , without improving the affected economies in any way . 
  nor has increased austerity . 
   i think it is implied we are talking about europe hence , olli rehn . 
  the inclusion of the sentence prior to the quote does n't change its meaning or the clear mention of the r&r study 's conclusion in the quote by mr rehn , nor did you specify a country in which you are looking for proof of the influence of study on monetary policy . 
  here you go :  `` [ i ] t is widely acknowledged , based on serious research , that when public debt levels rise about 90 % they tend to have a negative economic dynamism , which translates into low growth for many years . '' -- european commissioner olli rehn there 's more in the link http://qz.com/75117/how-influential-was-the-study-warning-high-debt-kills-growth/ edit : also , it was n't a bug in excel , instead it was using excel poorly and not checking the formulas - http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/04/microsoft-excel-the-ruiner-of-global-economies/ here 's another link for policy influences :  german chancellor angela merkel pointed to france 's lag in competitiveness last year by criticizing the gap between german and french unit labor costs . 
  she has cited research on debt and economic growth by rogoff and fellow harvard professor carmen reinhart to back up her debt-reduction policies . 
   in europe , r&r 's work and its derivatives have been used to justify austerity policies that have pushed the unemployment rate over 10 percent for the euro zone as a whole and above 20 percent in greece and spain . 
  in other words , this is a mistake that has had enormous consequences . 
  is one typical life-span all it took for this to rear its head again ? 
  nuance is needed , that not all asylum applicants are war-fleeing refugees is well understood . 
  that angela merkel has shat on her on own doorstep is clear to see - but that 's no excuse for base reactions . 
  the rise of the far-right is what this europe was born from - how does a return to europe 's nadir make it better ? 
  if islam is unacceptable for its strict rules ( something i think is the case in places like saudi arabia , but not islamic countries as a certainty ) , then what advantage is the far-right other than a cosmetic replacement ? 
  same shit , different way . 
  should n't ireland be in green ? 
  i would disagree . 
  while , on the surface , it has been between governments - all the decisions have ultimately been the ones that angela merkel espoused and according to some strong-armed the rest into following . 
  today 's news that german ministers knew about vw 's test cheating months ago , and yet did n't fix it , suggests to me that there 's a ` brush it under the carpet ' mentality at work . 
  the same mentality , i think , that has watched greece deteriorate & the syrian civil war escalate for ** years ** - yet here we are looking at these situations as if they could n't have been forseen . 
  being european was something i was proud of - i 'm not sure when i 'll feel like that again . 
  i fear this is going to be like the greek debt issue with european leaders vacillating , ` turning corners ' but ultimately making the problem worse & more intractable . 
  for the first time since i formed an opinion on the matter , i would now view leaving the eu as a solution rather than nightmare . 
  if angela merkel is secretly trying to show the world the perils of eu federalisation , i think she 's doing a good job . 
  i ca n't believe i once thought highly of her . 
  now we just have to find out who took the [ irish crown jewels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_crown_jewels ) , or find the truth amidst all the colourful humourous rumours . 
  yeah , par for the course to use first name only . 
  if it swaps to surname only then the person is usually on the way out the door . 
  it would seem the roman catholic church is n't capable of loving children at all , why else would it continue to cover up child rape & all the other documented abuses ? 
  i do n't understand the eu sometimes . 
  greece followed the eu & imf 's plan for years and it ended in the mess that exists now . 
  let 's hear jean-claude talking about his own failures to deliver ? 
  does he need reminding of the imf 's recent mea culpa for not realising how much damage their economic policies would do ? 
  if he 's worth hearing out , then why are n't there more success stories to his policies ? 
  why are n't we hearing more from european leaders about his repeated annual failures ? 
  you have my sympathies !, 
  yeah , documentation can definitely be a thing . 
  but then it 's biggest trouble shooter is using search engines for ' [ problem ] + [ software type ] ' . 
  if it 's not in official documentation , there 's usually some kind soul who has banged their head off the keyboard long enough to type the solution into a forum 's pages , 
  well i can see the logic in that from the the point-of-view of going with the longer established market presence . 
  as for the tco , i think enterprises appreciate the flexibility that comes with the open-source route 's cost - as well as more control over upgrade-shock . 
  the advantage with open-source in this case is that a company can grow its own support & expertise ; and eventually rely on itself . 
  the team does n't have to resort to outside help because of a closed-source wall it ca n't see over . 
  it can do code-audits as soon as an upgrade arrives or is requested , and alter what it needs to . 
  it is also immunised against forced-upgrade paths from closed-source vendors insisting that currently used software will no longer be supported . 
  plus , in a world of increasing surveillance & hack attacks - every place from kindergartens , shops & hospitals up to governments , multinationals & militaries will insist on the best security they can get . 
  taking it ` on faith ' from a closed-source vendor is no longer enough , not by a long shot . 
  whether inside a definition of ` critical infrastructure ' or not - many institutions & businesses will not accept it anymore . 
  ca n't see how countries looking to trim their squeezed budgets of huge licensing fees will agree to that . 
  nevermind the effect it would have on it education : imagine government school students not being allowed to use open-source code for projects , teachers not use open-source as code examples , use open-source systems as the bed-rock for real-world job preparation for the it industry . 
  the list goes on . 
  this proposal is as unworkable as it is protectionistic . 
  you 've got to wonder what closed-source code companies are proposing this , and what it says about their prospects that they would push for this type of short-sighted clause . 
  it 's worth getting [ unstuck for some things ] ( http://lh3.ggpht.com/_9f9_ruess2e/tgxepasxiti/aaaaaaaadf0/ageomb7mq9k/s800/pod0018-merkel-superglue.jpg ) , though i reckon the greek government must be getting tired of the ` solutions ' coming their way at this stage . 
  i guess it 's all about who pushes the button . 
  ejector seats are the new hotness this season anyway . 
  it 's not a comfortable watch , it took me two sittings to get through it - what happens to the kids does n't seem right at all . 
  i reckon it also depends on the age it happens . 
  i lost all faith in religion at 12 / 13 years of age - so puberty and all its roller-coasters did n't have that baggage sitting beside it . 
  i imagine to lose religion after having puberty + religion must be a fair amount harder . 
  absolutely , one of the loudest ` no ' vote advocates ( breda o'brien ) received a payment for being called ` homophobic ' on a tv chat-show by a guest a few months back ( a crazy story on its own ) . 
  did she give all that money to charity ? 
  well some of it : `` she described the $ 85,000 figure as quoted in some media as `` fairly accurate '' . 
  figures quoted in the sunday business report reported that john waters got about $ 40,000 , with the rest going to five members of the iona institute : david quinn , dr patricia casey , dr john murray and maria steen '' +1 = breda she would n't be the sort to spend such cash on herself when the christian thing to do would be to give that kind of easy money to the needy !? 
  i - `` so what did she do with the money from rt\u00c9 ? '', 
  b - `` some of it i gave to charity ... the rest went to pay my bills . '', 
  i - `` how much went to a good cause ? '', 
  b - `` that is like asking me what i had for my breakfast . '', 
  i - it seems some things are simply not for public consumption . 
  http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/gays-should-abstain-from-sex-like-all-unmarried-couples-31153701.html * it 's no surprise that she wrote an article in a national newspaper wondering where the ` yes ' groups were getting funding , though they 've declared all their funding , while many on the ` no ' side declared so late that they 're still not fully registered . 
  the group she 's with , iona , had to do a recent [ u-turn ] ( http://atheist.ie/2015/04/iona-institute-sipo-u-turn/ ) on registering for the referendum . 
  the people on the ` no ' side seem to wade through the stench of hypocrisy so frequently that they 've forgotten it stinks . 
  oh , that reminds me of watching [ jesus camp ] ( https://youtu.be/oy_u4u7-cn8?t=667 ), 
   it 's in pretty bad taste to compare nazism ( the oppression he references ) with a constitutional argument over legislative prayer or nsa surveillance . 
  are you serious ? 
  marco rubio is denigrating the 70th anniversary by co-opting that event with his appalling track-record on most of the freedoms that were established and promoted as a result ww2 . 
  it 's not remotely in bad taste for me to point his hypocrisy out , the bad taste is entirely his and frankly yours for not even caring to notice . 
  this article is intellectual and historical dishonesty of a brazenly tawdry order . 
  do you genuinely think people are going to fall for it ?
