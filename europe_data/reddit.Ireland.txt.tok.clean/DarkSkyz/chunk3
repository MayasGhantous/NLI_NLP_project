  look at what happened in dublin today , this thing affects dublin , oh my god something happened in dublin , the weather is bad in dublin !, 
  oh yeah , and some fella got stabbed in kilkenny or something - rte news . 
  other than that , there 's some good shows like the comedy series hardy bucks about young lads living in a small town . 
  you may know the guy who plays the viper in it from his `` adele wo n't stop calling me '' video . 
  republic of telly is a good comedy sketch show , though it can be hit or miss really . 
  love/hate was the best gangland drama to come out of ireland in years . 
  it looks like it 's over now , though people are speculating always that they could be bringing it back . 
  there 's a lot of crap shows on rte2 , such as `` meet the mcdonagh 's '' . 
  it 's literally the daily life of an irish traveller ( gypsy ) family . 
  watched a bit of it one night , there was a 5 minute scene of two children eating breakfast and talking about if they were going to get married one day . 
  simpsons at 6 o clock is always there though , perfect timing for dinner . 
  on the front of talk shows , the most prominent one is on friday night with the late late show . 
  it 's ... alright . 
  its yearly christmas episode , the late late toy show , is probably one of the most well loved shows in ireland , and has a great [ drinking game ] ( https://i.imgur.com/vjnpax3.jpg ) to go along with it if you ever feel like watching . 
  there 's always something for everyone in the audience !, 
  the ray d'arcy show is on saturday night , it 's new , and it 's complete shit . 
  the first week he got a jack nicholson impersonator on and pretended that he was actually jack nicholson until he revealed at the end of the interview he was n't . 
  tv3 used to be a hub of english soap operas but since utv ireland moved in it 's after losing them all . 
  just has a few american shows like judge judy and gameshows left now . 
  jeremy kyle in the mornings as well . 
  they 've tried to introduce their own toy show in the last few years but it 's been shit . 
  vincent browne leads political discussion on tv3 , he shows no mercy with the people he 's interviewing and will rip them to shreds if they do n't come prepared . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh1no2ghnnc ) a fantastic example from last years mep elections . 
  that about sums up irish tv . 
  lol, 
  it wo n't come into practise here till about summer 2016 , but up north they 're planning on doing the minimum pricing around the same time . 
  fuming over this nanny statism , this is not the right way to go about things . 
  a fucking 24 can slab for 50 euro or so ? 
  disgraceful shit . 
  fine gael are fucked in the next election for sure after this . 
  the best folk singer ireland had was [ luke kelly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euafmlvojow ) . 
  he sang and played banjo for ireland 's most famous folk group , [ the dubliners ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksdzokpvedc ) . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55obes98pj4 ) a [ few ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1vpdseb_30#t=48s ) [ of ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aengxispjhc ) [ my ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmn9xv3o3pc ) [ favourites ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytbc7cktwpo ) . 
  one song i absolutely love by them has to be [ seven drunken nights ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8hb5nzwe4i ) , sung by ronnie drew , because of how silly it is . 
  they also did a fantastic version of one of the hardest songs in my opinion that you can properly sing , [ the rocky road to dublin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtekuwrpuwg ) . 
  unfortunately kelly died in 1984 due to complications brought on by his alcoholism , and the group have disbanded since their final 50th anniversary tour , with many of the original members having passed away . 
  now , another big thing in irish folk music is the theme of rebellion , against the british . 
  some you 'll find will be about the [ 1916 rising ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b605qq7xbzm ) and the subsequent [ irish war of independence ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orifieizip4 ) , [ some ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwm8pcaynbm ) are just general rebel songs . 
  many were also written before and during the troubles in northern ireland , often being about [ ira ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxptoxjozgg ) [ members ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrcol1g9yja ) , or about the [ issues ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxzheokvn0s ) of the civil unrest during that period . 
  from county to county you 'll find many local folk songs too , but these would be some of the best in my opinion . 
  edit : just gon na add two more , [ christy moore - ordinary man ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lih5duoz824 ) and [ song for ireland - the dubliners ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz_dhcduutu ) ( also the last song recorded by luke kelly before his death ), 
  i 'm not worried about ireland being attacked , we 're not under a state of emergency at the moment . 
  i 'm just saying if you 're in a country that 's had a recent massive attack i 'm sure the police and government are n't just going to pretend day-to-day lives can go on as normal for a period of the future . 
   bend over and drop your pants if you want calm down there , armchair revolutionary . 
  yes but you did n't have possible terrorists running rampant across the states during the time of 9/11 . 
  there 's been quite a lot of attack warnings and plots foiled over the past few weeks here . 
  a massive terrorist attack occured not to mention the wave of migrants , god knows how many are actually terrorists , pouring across europe . 
  this is n't fucking 1984 , this is a rational response to a very dangerous climate . 
  look at how many terror attacks are being foiled across europe recently . 
  until this crisis is dealt with you ca n't expect life to go on as normal . 
  itt : people not understanding what both thought police and state of emergency is, 
  oh i 've got a great pronouncation story from some americans going through a village in kerry . 
  my friend 's da and his friend were drinking outside a pub in the village they lived in when some irish americans come by in a car . 
  they lean out at the two lads with their map and ask them if this is `` clog-hane '' ( the village is called cloghane , but pronounced cla-haan . ), 
  the lads nod and one of the americans goes `` boy , this sure is the asshole of ireland is n't it ? '' . 
  the friend of his da 's replies , `` yeah , we get a lot of shit flowing through here . '', 
  would you ever fuck off out your high horse there lad . 
  even though i 'm a guinness/murphy 's drinker i 'm still a bit surprised it 's the most drank beer over here . 
  most people i know drink carlsberg or bulmers cider . 
  can we please for one thread like this not fucking reference 1984, 
  great job pulling that statistic out of your arse . 
  in ireland , i 'd say the vast majority of children have seen cows , they 're all over the place here , considering beef being a massive export . 
  the amount of vegans in this thread is surprising . 
   lessen suffering kek, 
  honestly i feel this situation will have the media 's attetnion a lot longer . 
  it seems many countries are starting to close their borders , which is sure to lead to violent clashes at the border gates , and of course mass outpouring of sob stories from liberal medias , as well as demonizing stories from right wing ones . 
   the people 's republic of caaaark ftfy . 
  though it really should be  least favourite neigbour : dublin fucking jackeens . 
  as someone from ireland , thank christ . 
  it 's so bloody expensive now to order from the uk site with the currency difference , not to mention their shipping prices . 
  have to got through a third party there ( parcel motel ) if you do n't want to get completely ripped off on shipping . 
   as if refugees are all criminals . 
  the guy is referring to the calais migrants , who are illegal immigrants . 
  you seem to call them refugees here . 
  oh stop being so pedantic . 
  you know damn well that those in the calais jungle are not all refugees . 
  your logic is you do n't like the other persons argument so you jump to call them a racist , therefore shutting down the argument . 
  nah i 'm grand thanks . 
  if someone was to make a joke about two irish lads i would assume they 'd use them names and would n't be offended because they 're popular irish names that come to mind . 
  huh . 
  you learn something new every day . 
  i knew they were n't letting murderers out , i was just making a joke . 
  it 's alright bashir , we know you did n't really mean to kill those 4 people with a kitchen knife . 
  you 're free to go . 
  now muhammed , bring in that traitor who called erdogan a dog on twitter !, 
  completely , the guy seems like a total egomaniac . 
  it really is n't , he 's exaggerating . 
  we do n't like israel but the only people who 'd care about someone being a jew is someone already looking for a fight . 
   any new police powers will be used to fight piracy . 
  yes , the main concern in this is that because of terrorist attacks ... we wo n't be able to pirate stuff ? 
  calm down comrade . 
  as much as i support their cause if it was a right wing group protesting migrants there would be uproar . 
  children should n't be holding signs at protests full stop but i also understand the parents might not be able to get anyone to mind them . 
  there 's more to a nation than a name . 
  there 's a culture and a history behind that , one that is very hard to erode . 
  when i think of a nation that you describe of , i think of sweden and look how well trying to erode their own culture is going for them . 
  ireland is a country with only fresh independence and a history of being a victim of oppression . 
  the nation is proud to stand as they do and it would be very difficult to get rid of that feeling . 
  ugh i hate this sentiment . 
  should i feel shameful for being proud of my country ?
