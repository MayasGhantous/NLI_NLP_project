* tastes like beer but it looks like cideeeer * ... 
  so should we start calling dutch gold gouda ? 
  * for any irish out there * ... 
  were n't up for the craic with us either , soft pricks ... 
  how old was this guy ? 
  the somali air force has n't existed since [ 1991 ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/somali_air_force ), 
  is this from the ceausescu documentary ? 
  he 's probably more understandable in [ english ] ( https://youtu.be/gejajl_huh0 ), 
  always preferred [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/gpfjtokuzqm ) as a song about war , or [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/f1yxhzpcmaq ) for a folk song ...

  not saying anything about the nazi thing , it * is * unfortunate that the nazi 's named the battle of the bulge operation after [ wacht am rhein ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_bulge ) though ... 
  feckin ' swiss , they always have to be * so * different ... 
  it sounds feckin ' huere geil is what it sounds like ... :-) seriously though , i learned german in school in ireland , but worked summers in switzerland with relatives , i lived for a while in germany later on and those few summers had * destroyed * my german , i used to get some properly funny looks ... 
  not the greatest quality video in fairness , that said , its even more disconcerting if you actually speak german :-) ... 
  i dunno dave , ode to joy always makes me happy ... 
  trust the frenchman to have le * mot juste * ... ;-), 
  that was brilliant !, 
  i do n't know about german having negative pr , i speak it myself ( albeit with a horrendous irish/swiss accent ) , i was more speaking about the eu anthem being in german , we have a thing in our country about the germans being our * real * [ rulers ] ( https://youtu.be/bdme0kdu5ak ) :-), 
  if fat les ai n't culture i do n't want to know what is ... 
  considering your flair i thought you were going to link [ vindaloo ] ( https://youtu.be/va6npu-1aue ) ;-), 
  there 's definitely a traditional irish/scottish air to that , to my ears , different yet the same . 
  of course someone with a username like u/treehaggis would be posting about bagpipes btw ;-), 
  we 're a pretty advanced lot us irish , not like those unsophisticated scots with their outdated wind instrument technology ... :-), 
  jesus , i never knew that , thanks for the til ... 
  how the hell did you end up with bagpipes in the balkans ? 
  we mess up a lot of things as a union , but at least we got the anthem right , always brings a tear to my eye . 
  do n't kill me , but i actually prefer it in [ german ] ( https://youtu.be/a23945btjyw ), 
  hang on , you lot have [ uilleann pipes ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/uilleann_pipes ) ? 
  we 've just got to roll with the punches cormac ... 
  oh * you * ;-), 
  ah c'mon , he was always good for an aul flare up !, 
  good man , that 's an attitude that 'll end well ;-), 
  fair enough , i do n't entirely disagree with you about some of the stuff posted there . 
  you were good craic though , and you always seemed to have a bit of self aware sharpness about you , you were definitely an addition , despite that you 'd probably take that as an insult ;-), 
  you 're missed over there , genuinely , you 'd be welcomed back with open arms you know . 
  your brand of american exceptionalism was the closest the sub ever came to to perpetual sas motion . 
  to be fair to you , you even got the odd zinger or two in yourself ... 
  did i say any of that ? 
  i do declare , i must be getting quite forgetful , one only has to peek at your comment history to find some racist , xenophobic , true blue , good ol' american exceptionalism !, 
  hey chief , i 'm familiar with your past work , no need to pretend with me !, 
  oh , its * you * , hello !, 
  have an aul ' edit at your post , i think the moooslems may have been interfering with your internet machine , cos ' you 're coming coming across as an ignorant , illiterate racist who does n't know what he 's talking about . 
  you 're better than that , you 're an ignorant racist who does n't know what he 's talking about ;-), 
  nope , the contrary in fact , but its hardly comparible to be fair , gerry adams was n't calling for the extermination of the british people before , during , or after the troubles ( do n't know why you felt the need to italicise that particular word , but hey , you do you ) ... 
  its a tricky balancing act between accepting their history and asserting their estonian nationality i 'm sure . 
  there 's no easy solutions i 'm afraid , you can use us as a cautionary example if it helps !, 
  well i suppose if they are russian ethnic towns they can call things what they want ? 
  it does n't say much for their willingness to realise that they are actually estonian , but that 's another problem entirely , and hopefully not one as bitter and violent as we experienced . 
  a lot of maps had to be thrown after we won independence , if that was the worst of it we would have counted ourselves lucky ... 
  do n't bother kumpel , read that fella 's post history , there 's no point ... 
  absolute bollocks quite frankly ... 
  drop the welfare state ? 
  the very cornerstone of the our ww2 european social compact ? 
  yeah , that 's not happening , the us system is used as a cautionary tale in europe , the australian immigration system will be adopted before the welfare state is abandoned ... 
  * terribly * hard not to go godwin with bayer in fairness ... 
  i was only joking really , still though , its your country , at least no one tried to tell us what monuments we could or could n't have around the place . 
  quick question actually , did you guys have a load of streets and places that you had to rename after gaining independence ? 
  should of done what we did with our former occupiers monuments , and [ blown them up ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nelson%27s_pillar ) in a hilariously half arsed manner ... 
  jesus lads , and i thought * we * were bad with the territorial revanchism , no wonder the poles fit in over here so well ;-), 
  oh i think we bang on about it enough for it to have edged into the consciousness of * some * r/europe posters ... 
  and what a service , in fact , i thank you for it ... o7, 
  err , i know you normally take the piss , but thats kinda true : `` what is that in your hand ? 
  it is a branch . 
  of what ? 
  of the tree of liberty . 
  where did it first grow ? 
  in america . 
  where does it bloom ? 
  in france . 
  where did the seeds fall ? 
  in ireland . '', 
  * please resume normal service *, 
  i 'm a week late to this , you 're a glorious bastard , shine on you crazy diamond ... 
  not `` americans '' , people like you , and it ca n't be a job , no job is this easy ... 
  if people are subscribed to r/europe by geolocation , can they not just unsubscribe americans by geolocation ? 
  disgusting stuff ... 
  i reckon we could wrangle a parachute payment out of you lads along the lines of `` x amount for y years and you 're done , otherwise , we 're voting no ( the republic gets a vote too you know ) '' , bargain for you fellas in the long term ... 
  cheap fucking credit , corrupt/incompetent local planning , topped off by eejits ( amongst whom i count myself ) who `` had to buy before prices go up even further '' , result : no joke , a lost generation and a fuckload of empty , most likely shoddily built , houses in ballygobackwards that no cunt in their right mind would consider living in ... 
  6 ai n't bad i suppose , still , our third level sector is woefully underfunded ... 
  no , our fried rice is awful , and their bigger neighbour that they used to be part of decided to get rid of them , our path was , well , more than a little bit different ... 
  to be fair , if i was that far down the rabbithole , i 'd probably already * be * an mi5 agent !, 
  i 'd say there 's plenty of room in downing street , and i hear brighton is lovely this time of year !, 
  * might be going down a bad road with this one if i 'm honest * . . 
  good man , all about the recycling so we are !, 
  * doffs cap roguishly * ... 
  you 're not wrong , there 's a lot of debate about how to move forward at the moment , we 've just finished electing a hamstrung smorgasbord of a parliament though , so signs are n't good ... 
  well , if you 're into that sort of thing ... 
  yeah , its funny stuff , there 's a bunch of them , mostly soccer related though . . 
  * begins fashioning suspicious package * . . 
  * twitches * ... 
  well , there 'd definitely be jobs in dublin in your field , you 're right , there 's a couple of big firms in cork , galway and limerick as well , not sure if they 'd have people specialising in that area though . 
  donegal is lovely , west clare for the win though , maybe not so much with the quiet in fairness ... 
  yup , rakes of biotech in galway , pharmaceutical in cork , and tech in dublin ( apple in cork as well of course ) , i 'd say most jobs that would be available to americans would be highly technical or upper management though ... 
  i 'm going to go out on a limb here and guess , badly , funnily enough i know someone who was working for larionovo and then got a job in revenue right before the recession hit , talk about poacher turned gamekeeper !, 
  plenty of work in galway if you know how to pull a pint , not so much if you do n't have a visa though , unless you have an aul ' irish granny stashed away somewhere ... 
  bulgarian holiday homes for some , more comfortable hospital trolleys for others !, 
  you have to be careful though , would n't want the big bags of unexamined cash to get damaged !, 
  you 're [ welcome ] ( https://youtu.be/gejajl_huh0 ) !, 
  always nice to receive financial advice from our german [ overlords ] ( https://youtu.be/old8nv7c8qs ) !, 
  ireland here , who needs aircraft carriers ?
