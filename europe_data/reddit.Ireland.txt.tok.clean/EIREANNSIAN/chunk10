  the discussion was `` ireland never invaded or colonised anyone '' , not `` the irish never did anything wrong '' , and you 're conflating the actions of a country , the uk , with that of an illegal dissident organisation , the ira , they are not comparable . 
  playing a role in the british empire is absolutely something i would be ashamed of , it was a horrendous blight on the world , killed millions , and exploited and ruined hundreds of millions of people for the benefit of a few ... 
  ireland was n't * voluntarily * part if the union , you seem to be missing that part , we were britain 's first colony , and what the hell does the ira have to do with anything , they have n't been an arm of the irish state since 1921 ? 
  the fact that starving irishmen joined the british army to feed themselves and their families ( also bearing in mind that you could not be a catholic officer in said army for quite a significant period ) , or that some individual irishmen were imperialist , does not make ireland complicit . 
  is poland complicit in the holocaust because some poles collaborated with the germans ? 
  you obviously have no clue of the history of british rule over ireland , so i 'm not sure i should bother continuing ... 
  sorry , but i do n't get your point ? 
  are you seriously trying to say that because ireland was colonised and ruled by britain , something it had no power to alter , and suffered from horribly , that it was * also * responsible for the actions of the british empire ? 
  seriously ? 
  you 're trying to make that argument . 
  irishmen joined the british army because it was that or starve , hardly due to enthusiastic support for the glorious empire , jesus christ ... 
  yeah , i can see that , i suppose being english speaking i am more exposed to brits/yanks doing it online ... 
  i 'm not trying to say that british people are morally inferior , or that british people today have any culpability for what happened in the past . 
  what i 'm getting at is not that british people are denying what their country did in the past , but that * some * attempt quite rigourously to whitewash their history , `` everyone was doing it '' , `` we gave them the railroads '' , `` britain brought civilisation '' , `` the famines were due to economics/bad administration '' , you see things like that online quite a bit from british posters , there 's some even in this thread , and i would class that as denial of a sort ... 
  i agree with your first point completely , every country , including my own , has people who like to exaggerate the importance of their own country ( see the wave of `` best fans in the world '' bollocks from the euros for a recent irish example ) . 
  with regards to the teaching of a countries history though , and this may be because i 'm irish and obviously would have my own biases , i do think there 's something amiss with how it is taught in the uk , purely based on how many people you see online ( not an ideal sample section i know ) whitewashing and hand waving away what happened , its not every british person , not even a majority , but enough to make me think that perhaps kids in school are n't being taught a balanced narrative ... 
  the tribes and kingdoms of ireland absolutely went to war with each other , that 's true . 
  i 've no doubt that other nations at other times would have * liked * to do what the british did , but they did n't , so it 's a coulda-woulda-shoulda kind of thing . 
  there 's a not inconsequential number of british people today who glory in their former empire , either not knowing , or caring , what it actually did around the world , which is quite disturbing if you ask me . 
  i 've had conversations with british people who have told me that they are not taught about the irish famine , the indian famines , the destruction of cultures , things like british concentration camps in south africa or kenya , only the good things about the empire . 
  meh , you 're reaching a touch if you have to go back to the 6th and 7th centuries tbh , and the picts were n't a nation state , they were a group of tribes/clans basically ... 
  no worries :-) . 
  believe me , most irish are painfully aware of our history , it did n't involve colonising or oppressing other countries though ... 
  as daniel o'connell said about mr wellesley , being born in a stable does not make one a horse , and the same goes for other anglo ascendancy types . 
  they were n't irish , and did n't consider themselves irish , they were the descendants of colonists and rulers put in place by the british , they were british , also , `` awesome people from the empire '' , lol , what do they teach you over there ... 
  were we fuck !, 
  really , you ca n't think of a single european country that never colonised or oppressed other countries ? 
  not at all !, 
  * sings * `` low lie , the fields of athenry '' ... 
  to be fair , they 're forever telling us the famine was caused by `` market forces '' and not by the fact that they were a bunch of robbing genocidal bastards . 
  my own theory is that a bunch of robbing bastards used market forces to commit genocide , but that 's just me !, 
  * import potatoes * ? 
  why did n't me think of that sooner ? 
  what use is a mountain of butter without any spuds to spread it on ? 
  that 's just torture !, 
  oh believe me , we 're all literally dying to see `` famine 2 , potato-boogaloo '' ... 
  oh , we 've a few , 1649 , 1690 , 1796 , 1798 , 1800 , 1803 , of course 1845-1852 were n't fantastic , 1867 , and 1916 , you could probably throw 1969-1998 in there as well ... 
  we 're good at that in fairness , you never know , we could get the yanks to chip in a few bob as well ... 
  i ** reject ** your guess as it is obviously * not * made in the spirit of reconciliation ... * breathes heavily * ... 
  well , [ here 's ] ( https://youtu.be/gejajl_huh0 ) another one for you then !, 
  jesus that guy was brilliant , the levels of ridiculous ott accents of people on that show pretending to be one nationality , speaking another language , to somebody pretending to be a different nationality speaking another language again , just bloody special . 
  i do n't see non-native english speakers getting it tbh ... 
  voiceover on allo ' allo ' ? 
  i ca n't get my head around that !, 
  my granny used to love that show , the painting of the madonna with the big boobies was a particular favourite ... 
  please tell me it was n't dubbed ... 
  a british look at [ northern ireland ] ( https://youtu.be/wxpyw_w5pgo ), 
  look through youtube comments under a video about * any * country and you 'll find hate . 
  if there 's a video about ireland you 'll find hateful comments under it , guaranteed , its hardly a useful yardstick for judging how real people view a country , however , its 15th most respected country in [ this ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2015/07/15/the-worlds-most-reputable-countries-2015/#6dd4a4f33802 ) survey , and scores highly in any other one you can lay your hands on , internet trolls and brexiters do not represent the majority views of europeans ... 
  germany is n't hated in europe , that 's ridiculous ... 
  still the same amount of fiscal rectitude on display though ... 
  you know that they 're not singling out netflix right ? 
  it 's not like they had a choice of `` netflix , or something else '' ... 
  if by that you mean mel gibson had some burgers when he was filming it in the curragh well then , you may have a point !, 
  to be fair , if they 're american soldiers , they 're probably already * in * a mcdonalds . 
  now * that 's * forward deployed ... * belly toward enemy *, 
  good man , you 'll fit right in ... 
  5 a side over 75 's * priests * football ? 
  because we have an opening , do you like drink and girls ? 
  ah yeah , i was only joshing , and mainly referring to the citizenship by birth two generations out , which is pretty generous by european standards . 
  i know that they have citizenship exams and ceremonies for people becoming naturalised citizens ... 
  yeah , we 're one of the easiest countries in the eu to get citizenship in , probably a side effect of no bastard wanting it until very recently !, 
  i could see it tightening up in the near future , there 's already a lot of us applications , and uk ones have been rising since the brexit referendum was announced ... 
  any other irish here take that and feel that we 've been tricked into something ? 
  i keep looking out my window expecting to see aul ' liz coming up the hill riding a corgi to take me away ... 
  in ireland its : what was your grandma/grandpa 's name ? 
  mary/paddy ? 
  you 're in !, 
  you 're not handy at the aul ' soccer by any chance ? 
  oh look , he 's back , do n't worry , he 'll delete it in a bit , notorious coward this lad , the current theory is that an irish navvy rogered his aul ' one and she 's never been the same since ... 
  too true ... 
  yeah , i 'm the bigger eejit for getting drawn into this shite twice in as many days !, 
  got to learn to let it go , there 's no talking to some people ... 
  [ nope ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/celtic_britons ) !, 
  ireland is not british , at all , full stop , and irish people are not britons , or british , the same way estonia is not russia , and estonians are n't russians ... 
  going around in circles here chief , you 're no more open to being convinced than i am , its boring at this stage , you do you , i 'll do me ... 
  believe what you want man , xd xd xd, 
  like i said , whatever you want to tell yourself chief , no butthurt here , though you seem a touch worked up , just pointing out facts , the fact that an outdated political term is in a dictionary does n't make it true , or a fact . 
  myself and others will be happy to correct you when you make the mistake of using the term , happy to help !, 
  seems like a fair few people here disagree with you , but you keep telling yourself that chief !, 
  whatever makes you happy ... 
  well , he was fat , british , and an imperialist , soo ... not bitter , not denying facts , the fact that you 're reduced to going * nyaa nyaa i 'll do what i wan na * is enlightening and illustrative though . 
  like i said , call them what you want , just expect to be corrected for being wrong , have a good one !, 
  that 's the thing , it has n't been in popular use for 2000 years , at all , if you 're reading wikipedia pages you should understand that , and i 've already explained that to you . 
  used once , by a greek who was never there , and then popularised by a fat british imperialist for political reasons 1600 years later is not `` in popular use for 2000 years '' . 
  and it 's not `` a few left wing nationalists '' , who have an issue with , or do n't use , the term , its the people of ireland , their government , and the government of the united kingdom , so , pretty much everyone that matters . 
  no , they have n't been called the british isles since roman times , they were briefly called the british isles by a greek who never visited the islands , and thought there were three main islands . 
  the term was popularised by the british imperialist [ john dee ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_dee ) in the 16th century as a means of claiming british ownership of , and control over , ireland . 
  you can call the islands what you want , just expect to be corrected by irish people if you call them the `` british isles '' , because , when you get down to it , the isles in question are not , in fact , british , no matter what a 16th century fat imperialist would like to tell you . 
  read [ here ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_isles_naming_dispute ) , its not about being politically correct , its about being correct , and `` british isles '' is not the accepted term , and is far from a fact , its a hangover from british imperial days , and should n't be used , the same way that ceylon , rhodesia , bombay , siam and burma should n't be used ... 
  no worries , happy to help !, 
  well , english people have a celtic heritage amongst others , just to be clear , british \u2260 celtic ... 
  why would he ? 
  out of anyone listed the english would be the * least * offended by the name ... 
  no , we 're [ not ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/brittonic_languages ), 
  no it 's not , neither the british or irish governments use the term , for obvious reasons ... 
  a british person is somebody from britain/great britain ( some scots might n't be happy with it ) . 
  you could say a british person is a citizen of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , but there 's plenty of people in northern ireland who are not british , so i 'd stick to english , scottish and welsh to be safe if i were you . 
  what * is * 100 % certain is that irish people are in no way british , we used to be occupied by them , but that 's not the same thing . 
  dunno about the welsh , they can look out for themselves , we 're certainly not though ...
