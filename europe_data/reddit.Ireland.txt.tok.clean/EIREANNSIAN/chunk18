  the uk has created this situation , not the eu . 
  i was talking to someone from ni , and used the word `` our '' , it 's sad to come across so many brits who struggle with their own language , but unsurprising ... 
  you defame innocent people that your country murdered , your opinion counts for nothing , you are objectively an awful person . 
  i 'm glad you find me insufferable , it warms the cockles of my heart . 
  if i can annoy someone as abhorrent as you you i think i 'm doing some small service in this world ... 
  good stuff . 
  i 've screenshotted your attempt to blame murder victims for the crimes of your country 's military . 
  it should be illuminating to point out your position in the future on this sub , thanks !, 
  far more innocent than yours anyway ... 
  but i 'm guessing someone like yourself is proud of their government 's murder ... you seem the type , scum that is ...

  and who would be responsible for that ? 
  i gotcha bruv , any questions , i 'm here for you ... 
  tee-shuck , or tee-shack , depending . 
  it means `` chieftain '' or `` leader '' in irish ... 
  i think we 're a disastrous brexit off a border poll , we 're around 10 years off a nationalist demographic majority ( many of whom would not want to rock the boat now ) , if they 're given a clear opportunity to improve their lot i could see it happen ... 
  well i vote for invasion anyway ... 
  they 've obviously never met an actual irish person then , or anyone who 's met an irish person , or seen one on tv even . 
  it shows a shockingly poor grasp of history and current affairs that is sadly unsurprising ... 
  `` lol '' , will do ... 
  rubbish , they 're having their red white and blue cake and eating it on top of a # 350 million double decker bus ... 
  the `` stop hitting yourself '' method of international relations , let 's see how well that works for the uk ... 
  we had to shoot our way out of the union we did n't want to be in , something a * lot * of brits do n't seem to think pertinent ... 
  you irish are such a contentious people ... 
  i 'm sure we 'll all be fine with the british drawing a line across our island again , sure there were n't any troubles with it the last time they did it ... 
  the uk 's action has caused this matter to arise , they are the ones responsible for its consequences . 
  if you ca n't comprehend why that is the case i 'm afraid i 'm not going to be able to help you ... 
  did the eu kick the uk out while i wasnt looking ? 
  you did n't do that for us you lying bastard !, 
  do n't worry though , we 're all pals now , but you ca n't blame us for treating you like the mate who shat himself on a night out with the whole brexit thing ... we 'll be over in the corner with belgium and germany having a pint while you lads tidy yourselves up ... 
  the length and depth of anglo-irish animosity goes far deeper and longer than that between the uk and germany , at least on the irish side ... also `` two world wars and one world cup '' - quite a few english people at the drop of a hat , or is it 10 german bombers ? 
  irish people get nervous when they hear brits talking about sharing the love , their previous experience with british love being a touch on the rapey side ;-), 
  that fucking eejit ... because [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b3eqlnk.jpg ) mong just * inspires * confidence in his geopolitical insight ... 
  `` lol '' replied the entire country of ireland ... 
  ah , grand so , cheers !, 
  oh , sorry about that , did n't spot it , apologies !, 
  well , yes , does n't stop certain sections of the british press trying to push the narrative that there is though . 
  misery loves company i suppose ... 
  the french ? 
  r/mapswithoutireland edit : huh , fuck me , that 's an actual subreddit ... 
  well , we 'd call them `` knackers '' , `` scobies '' or `` scumbags '' , but yes , your friends are not wrong ... 
  i mean , the uk helped cause a lot of the world 's problems , would have been best of they 'd chosen to leave other countries alone a couple of hundred years ago ... 
  so is the uk , and france , and holland , and pretty much half of europe by that ridiculous standard , that 's not deflection , that 's just a statement of fact ... 
  the eu ca n't force ireland to make any changes to its tax regime that are n't already agreed by treaty ... 
  [ this ] ( https://www.google.ie/amp/www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/08/frances-former-tax-tsar-sentenced-three-years-jail-tax-fraud/amp/ ) france ? 
  the one with the hilariously notorious opaque tax system where headline rates mean nothing ? 
  * that * france ? 
  yeah , no , try again , eejit ... 
  `` ireland is nothing but a tax haven '' you , now have a look at yourself chief , and * maybe * your own country 's practices , before you start flinging shit around ... eejit ... 
  you might want to look at some of your compatriots if you 're looking for xenophobic posters to ban ... 
  ireland as california ? 
  i think climate wise we 're more like washington state to be honest ... 
  [ sure ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/republic-of-ireland-among-most-tolerant-in-world-for-religion-1.3046766 ) [ thing ] ( http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/irish-among-most-tolerant-in-europe-357109.html ) irish people racist as fuck ? 
  do n't chat shite , there 's a good lad ... 
  ok then !, 
  sarcasm , learn what it is chief ... 
  history 's eternal victims , the british ... 
  it 's non-existant ( or might as well be ) in ireland , and we 've had proportionately more polish immigration than the uk or the netherlands , so it 's certainly nothing to do with the actual polish people ... 
  [ yup ] ( http://www.thepoke.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/c_uc_aexkaik6cythumb.jpg ), 
  how exactly is it ridiculous and paranoid ? 
  hardly surprising that ireland wants no association with britain is it ? 
  meh , fuck em ' , they 're a tiresome annoyance on this sub , i do n't see the harm in pissing them off ... 
  those peace loving brits , all they ever do is try to get along with others !, 
  aww , i 'm sure you 're hopping up and down , you should be thanking me for giving you a reason to vent your ever-present bile ... * your welcome *, 
  weirdly , being irish , he 's the * other * sort of island monkey , as opposed to the more usual inselaffen ... 
  - ireland , we think you 're a grand bunch of lads ( los malvinas son argentinas ) - the west of ireland is the prettiest , galway and the burren , west cork is very nice - the best food for me is in italy - prettiest women : czech republic , poland , scandanavia, 
  err , did you somehow miss out on who your countrymen elected president , and the party that they 've handed parliamentary control over to ? 
  did you also miss the vile shit your president has said about european countries and the threats he 's made against them ? 
  sorry chief , if you do n't expect an altered tone from europeans after that , then i 'm afraid your delusional af ... 
  i mean , if my countrymen elected someone like trump i 'd be pretty fucking mortified ... 
  fdr died before the end of the war , in fact , he died before hitler ... 
  was dead before the war even ended , not sure what the op is on about there ... 
  we should really get a british version of that , there 's enough apologists around here to justify it ... 
  `` christine kinealy , a great hunger scholar , lecturer , and drew university professor , relates her findings : almost 4,000 vessels carried food from ireland to the ports of bristol , glasgow , liverpool , and london during 1847 , when 400,000 irish men , women , and children died of starvation and related diseases . 
  she also writes that irish exports of calves , livestock ( except pigs ) , bacon , and ham actually increased during the famine . 
  this food was shipped under british military guard from the most famine-stricken parts of ireland ; ballina , ballyshannon , bantry , dingle , killala , kilrush , limerick , sligo , tralee , and westport . 
  a wide variety of commodities left ireland during 1847 , including peas , beans , onions , rabbits , salmon , oysters , herring , lard , honey , tongues , animal skins , rags , shoes , soap , glue , and seed . '', 
  since you 've now descended into insults , i have to say that it 's quite something that someone such as yourself , so utterly devoid of any sense of morality , should call me an idiot after displaying such a shocking lack of even the most basic and elementary reading skills . 
  i suppose i should expect nothing better from the type of troglodyte that would attempt to defend and diminish the long history of british atrocities around the world , you truly are pathetic , and devoid of any decency , you should be ashamed of yourself , but you are n't . 
  we 'll leave it there , there 's nothing further to be gained from interacting with your type ... 
  yup , of course the holodomor and the irish famine were purely administrative errors that just * happened * to result in the deaths of millions and the near destruction of the societies afflicted , which just * happened * to be an aim of the government 's involved ... 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_famine_ ( ireland ) #irish _ food_exports_during_famine, 
  they stole the land , turned the people into serfs , and * increased * food exports from ireland under armed guard while over a million people died and another million emigrated . 
  yeah , the british , great lads altogether , true altruists ... 
  it just keeps getting better !, 
  `` own country '' oh jesus , please stop , i ca n't take any more !, 
  they did something similar in ireland during the famine , it was all just a great big accident though , of course ... 
  reads literally * anything * to do with the history of britain in ireland ... `` backstabbing '' - rolls around the floor creased over laughing, 
  laugh when they drop a nuke on trump 's toupee ? 
  that nag was a fuckin ' tout who got what was coming to him ... also , shergar was an irish horse , could n't really be stolen from the brits ... 
  irish special snowflake status confirmed . 
  seriously though , we 'd lose out feckin ' minds , there 's nothing more denigrating to an irishman than being called british , * shudders *, 
  `` countrymen '', 
  yeah , that would * not * go down well , fine with winding the yanks up though ... 
  yeah , no ... 
  it 's thankfully not even a remote possibilty , 88 % eu approval in ireland ... 
  jaysus , that suit and tie colour combo alone, 
  ireland is ironically one of the few countries that runs a trade deficit with the uk , so by current prossecco-and-german-cars british thinking , ireland will be better off with brexit !, 
  `` man jumping off cliff would like some company '', 
  damn , son ...
