  whack a few barrel bombs onto regularly scheduled ryanair flights , job done . 
  that said , the excess baggage charges would be a bit tasty , do n't think you 'd fit a barrel bomb into that hand luggage measuring bastard of a thing ... 
  no way of countering that with any kind of metric device , i 'd say * that 's * why you lot retain imperial measurements , checkmate yuropoors !, 
  `` large '' , you 're very kind with your wording there ... yeah , i made a fat joke , sue me ... 
  `` colombian criminal peasant '' ? 
  that 's a very specific subset you 've got going on there , unless you 're implying that all columbian peasants are criminal ? 
  if you get a chance , check out [ love/hate ] ( love/hate http://imdb.com/rg/an_share/title/title/tt1625724/ ) , its finished now but it 's one of the best shows to come out of ireland ... 
  i think there 's more calls for them to cop on and negotiate some deal , but it 's a shitshow , no doubt about that ... 
  ** triggered ** ... 
  nice , saved ... that [ said ] ( https://youtu.be/jdkn57xveki ), 
  [ well ] ( https://youtu.be/vyk9ryccy2a ), 
  cheers !, 
  no bother , like i said , do n't take it as gospel , everyone has their own take on things , the way things are shaping up the only two possible governments are fg/ff ( historically unprecedented , unlikely ) and ff/sf/l ( they 're all out for each other 's voters , and sf has vowed not to be a junior partner with ff or fg ) , the only possible alternative is a minority government ( very unstable , and ff love a ministry ) or a new election , the budget will be september/october . 
  my advice ? 
  order in some popcorn in bulk ... 
  who does n't ? 
  here 's an explanation of the parties i posted earlier on : `` fianna fail : origins in the anti-treaty side ( did n't want to accept the partition of ireland and the compromises in the peace treaty after our war of independence ) of the civil war and the splitting of the original sinn fein . 
  republican ( not in the us sense , and only in name only these days ) , centrist , populist , with some left ideology at times but only as window dressing . 
  would have had a power base in both the cities and the countryside . 
  in power the longest out of any party , presided over the celtic tiger and subsequent economic meltdown , decimated in the last elections . 
  fine gael : origins in the pro-treaty side after the split of the original sinn fein and civil war . 
  would be viewed as having a rural , conservative base , though it would get votes in cities , and has a liberal wing . 
  flirted with fascism in the 30 's ( though that is overblown , it was a party that merged into what became fine gael ) . 
  currently the senior party in power , not popular with young people . 
  sinn fein : claims a linear descent from the original sinn fein ( though many would dispute that ) , was the political wing of the ira for many years , embraced a political path in the 80 's , after the hunger strikes , and entered the dail for the first time . 
  had very few seats for a long time , is very polarising and `` transfer-phobic '' , popular with a lot of young people , not so much with the older generations , who remember the troubles . 
  would still be viewed by many as having a `` whiff of cordite off them '' , particularly with gerry adams as leader . 
  won big in the last elections . 
  leftist politics , populist , very organised , used to be quite eurosceptic , not so much anymore . 
  quite popular destination for protest votes . 
  labour : the only large party that is n't descended from the original sinn fein !, 
  would have roots in the trade union movement , would mirror the british labour party in many ways , has been the junior party in several coalition governments , with both fianna fail and fine gael , gets obliterated after each one , and will again . 
  has moved more centrist in recent years , with sinn fein taking left votes , fianna fail centrist , and now the new social democrats coming to take what 's left . 
  is going to get hammered ( unfairly in my view ) this time round , has quite an unpopular leader in joan bruton , who does n't come across well . 
  has an election pact with fine gael . 
  a plethora of smaller parties , left and right , the social democrats ( new ) , the greens ( destroyed after going into power with fianna fail ) , renua ( quite right-wing , think us republican ) , aaa/pbp ( anti-austerity , protest politics , left wing , disjointed . 
  and finally , independents , the bane of irish political life ( in my view ) , single issue , local focused , a magnet for protest votes , parochialism and the disillusioned . 
  top topics , health ( our health system is a disaster ) , housing ( nothing 's being built ) , taxation ( basically who will cut more , and for whom , at this point ) , education ( university fees and the secularisation of primary and secondary education ) and the repeal of various property and water charges . 
  anyway , there you go , any irish people feel free to correct me , i may have let my own biases leak in a bit there ! '', 
  bon !, 
  coller \u00e0 ces b\u00e2tards anglais ^ i have no idea if that makes any sense , i used google translate , thought we 'd get that out of the way from the outset ... 
  well , you 're english , love never came into it , mild , arms length tolerance would be a happy medium ;-) that said , your love of coffee makes you beyond the pale , in every sense , i am about to commence active shunning ... * shunning engaged * ... 
  and here we were , having a nice chat like civilised people ... ** get out **, 
  not sure how keen we are on it either , the right to a quick cup of tea is intrinsic to our national identity , and you lot are n't far behind us in the tea stakes . 
  that 's why we need you to stay , without you we 'd be laid bare to the coffee drinking barbarian hordes ... 
  yay !, 
  * less powerful kettles for all !, 
  it does n't make up for it , at all , but i appreciate the sentiment !, 
  yerrah , apart from rooting for every team playing against england from international football to tiddlywinks we 're all pals now , we 'd miss you if you left , plus , we 'd be fucked * please do n't leave * !!, 
  well done on the win ... * grumble grumble * ... 
  when does n't she ? 
  well , to be fair , that 's because you always vote for us and we never vote for you , always feel a bit mean about that if i 'm honest ... 
  yeah , but ff has bounded back , which does n't really fit that narrative in fairness . 
  i completely agree with you about the rest though , people outside of dublin have felt very little of the recovery ... 
  i would n't call incorporating the workers party as being `` filled to the brim '' , good point on the seanad seat though ... 
  yeah , it should be sinn fein/pira ... do n't think labour were ever the political wing of the ira either , labour/ca maybe ? 
  we are living in interesting times politically , its great craic ( until the whole thing gets driven over a cliff ) , as for the rugby ? 
  bit of a dead rubber for us , so chances are we 'll beat you now that it does n't matter , just to be a pain in the hole !, 
  there 's no `` may '' about it , they absolutely wo n't get back in , we just have n't a clue who will ... 
  lol , well , we 're not california , not by a long stretch , we had a bad summer last year , [ here 's ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/the-weather-is-just-shocking-isn-t-it-just-shocking-1.2301028 ) an article on it !, 
  yes , many , we had a bad experience with not having and we 've made sure not to run out since , we 're not latvians ffs !, 
  i 'm with you , i had no problem in vegas , dry heat , fine , you 'll live . 
  you 'll have a grand time if you visit , everyone seems to , if you are there 's a really good resource called r/irishtourism that one of the lads over on r/ireland did up , loads of info and tips and advice , plenty cheap now with the $ / $ exchange rate ... 
  if it 's nice , its lovely , if it 's not , well , there 's always the pub , never really gets humid either way , we 've a coastal climate . 
  i 've travelled the world a fair bit , and you ca n't beat ireland on a sunny summers day , its so * green * , you do n't appreciate it till you leave . 
  the ohio river valley during the summer can suck my balls , fuck me , you leave the house and five minutes later you 're bathed in sweat , i had to take two or three showers a day , irishmen are n't made for that shite . 
  i often wondered what possessed the people spreading out west to settle there , a pack of germans going , yeah , its hot as balls , i ca n't breathe , we have n't invented air conditioning yet , and we 'll be under five feet of snow in a few months , perfect !, 
  if you like potatoes : heaven if you do n't ? 
  well , there 's always the pub !, 
  no wonder there are so many of you lads over here !, 
  only for them , everyone else can pay more ...

  yeah , i 've been out in pittsburgh , a mate of mine used to run a pub there , the claddagh , do you know it ? 
  i liked pittsburgh , good craic , a bit gritty but not in a bad way , unlike cleveland ... 
  galway , any time , there 's always something going on , but pints mainly , start with a few in taafes with the wild island boys , bound to be a bit of a session going , few songs , be grand , on up to the crusties in neachtains , take the piss out of said crusties while trying to crack on to the birds . 
  knock on up to tigh ceoili 's then for a few scoops , maybe grab a smokey bacon burger in supermacs for the roughage . 
  head over the river to the roisin dubh to see how the other half are getting on . 
  at this stage it 'll be around 10 or so and you 'll have a bit of a goo on , so back across the river , pop into the quays for a hop off a few tourist beurs , then into the front door for the rest of the night .
