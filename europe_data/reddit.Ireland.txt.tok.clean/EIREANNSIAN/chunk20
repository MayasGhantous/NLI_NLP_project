  to try and class the irish experience in the uk as in anyway equivalent to that of scotland , wales or england is fucking disgusting quite frankly . 
  your dismissal of the millions of dead and scattered is stomach-turning , truly . 
  such ignorance ... 
  has to be in tricolour form though , or have a cool blue triangle ( holla czechia !, 
  ) , otherwise it 's icky ... 
  because the choice was between that and starving ... 
  ** needs more red white and blue **, 
  i think you do them a disservice , i 'm entirely sure that the royal family crockery collection is a complete set , as is the royal mint battle of britain commemorative coin collection ... 
  there 's a little china bulldog as well ... 
  bless them , they 're their own little cottage industries . 
  i can just see them now , beavering away at their keyboards , bedecked in union jack 's and sipping tea out of mugs with the queen 's picture on them ... 
  why , can he fire trump ? 
  what ? 
  it 's the other way around ? 
  who gives a flying fuck about `` mad dog '' ( ffs ) mathis so ? 
  his word is n't worth shite if his boss is trump ... 
  can be zesty from time to time also ... 
  ireland is the only european country with a population lower than it had in the early 19th century , we 've plenty of room in fairness , just not in fucking dublin ... 
  red white and blue strong and stable, 
  depends on the accent though ? 
  tee-shock or tee-shuck are the ones i hear most commonly ... 
  yup , that 's about right . 
  which is fucking crazy ... 
  welcome to the wonderful world of the irish language !, 
  it gets worse ... 
  * australian ... 
  probably too busy listening to mozart and eating schnitzel to pay attention to the road , the louts ... 
  no result for ireland ... 
  it 's truly a mystery ... 
  i presume he 's referring to [ irish travellers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_travellers ), 
  they certainly do n't appear to like it up em ' , do they ? 
  deserters , or does the british army not punish deserters ? 
  would n't have it any other way ... 
  strong and stable ... 
  and red white and blue ... 
  hence why it is an innacurate , anachronistic term , and not used by either the british or irish governments , or any international body of note , i 'm glad that you are acknowledging it 's uselessness and why it should not be used ... 
  how does the fact that he was a propagandist detract from the fact that he was disseminating british propaganda , i.e , that ireland was owned by britain and was therefore a british isle ? 
  in addition , there is no indication that the term was in use by anyone prior to dee , not sure where you 're going with that ... 
  ireland is not a british isles , and let 's not have this conversation twice ... 
  he had a very specific reason for bringing the term out of an ancient text and into the english language , as we both know . 
  we do not use the greek name for pretty much any area or country , the actual greek who used it never visited the islands , it was a dead , innacurate term promulgated by an avowed british imperialist to express dominion over ireland , that is the factual reality ... 
  says who ? 
  the greeks ? 
  you must have missed my reference to the english language , and the thousand or so years where it was n't used by anyone , just another archaic and incorrect term ... 
  what part of ** `` in the english language '' ** are you struggling with in particular ? 
  grand so , good man , choccie hob-nobs if they 're going ... 
  cup of tea to seal the deal ? 
  a happy compromise ... 
  it 's not a geographical term , it 's a political term that did n't exist in the english language until it was introduced by a british imperialist ... 
  the always delicious irony of a brit labelling another country parasitic ... 
  i mean , who needs to watch the bloody news to know what their country consists of and who it 's citizens are ? 
  that 's pretty basic stuff surely ... 
  that does n't change the fact that close to half of british people either do not know whether or do not believe that their own supposed countrymen are eligible to vote in a general election . 
  not sure what bearing people in ni voting for their own parties has on that ... 
  apparently a whole pile of people ? 
  it has nothing to do with not liking the ussr in my view , and a whole lot to do with poor education and hollywood ... 
  `` the movies '' also `` what 's a history book ? '', 
  the uk \u2260 england , as you are of course conveniently ignoring , no-one except you mentioned england . 
  do try stay on topic , there 's a good chap ... 
  looks like you 're more american than [ irish ] ( https://www.google.ie/amp/www.rte.ie/amp/873610/ ) then chief , maybe you should shag off home ... 
  swing them a bit maybe ? 
  but not too much , i do n't really think there 's any good answers here ... 
  i mean , the worst bread i 've ever had in europe would be upper mid-tier bread in the us . 
  two things you lot do n't seem to do well on the mass consumer level is bread and chocolate ... 
  look , i know you 're upset that le pen lost tonight , and that makes me glad , so i wo n't bother with the rest of your shite , there 's no point linking you anything , you 're beyond education ... sweet dreams !, 
  nope , net contributor since 2015 , sorry if that upsets you ( not really though , you 're not a very pleasant person ), 
  how that man never won an emmy i 'll never know ... 
  this is why wilders lost ... 
  this is why macron won ... 
  it has actually , so you 're wrong , but , of course , you 're wrong about most things , so what 's new ? 
  this is why le pen lost ... 
  `` what do i do with my fucking hands ?!? '', 
  http://www.rte.ie/archives/2014/1118/660538-out-out-out/ in fairness , the evil aul ' bitch had enough negativity for more than one occasion ... 
  was n't it `` out , out , out '' ? 
  schadenfreude , fuck the bozos , also , it amuses me ... 
  * retches * ... 
  this is why le pen lost ... 
  well , macron is coming after our corporation tax , he 'll get no where , but still ... 
  without nationalism irish people would still be under the british boot . 
  there are different forms of nationalism , there 's nothing wrong with civic nationalism ... 
  keep going , honestly , you 're fantastic !!, 
  ;-) lmao ... 
  god , you morons are endlessly entertaining , your idiotic schtick does n't work over here , but please , do n't stop trying , it 's hilarious !, 
  the ~ ~ canadian ~ ~ irish government has apologized for ~ ~ justin bieber ~ ~ bono on several occasions !, 
  you 're weird swinging from the outrageous and insulting to the reasonable is honestly quite entertaining ... 
  meh , we inflicted bob geldoff on you , everyone 's got their share of cunts !, 
  what a delusional , insufferable cunt ... - the entire country of ireland, 
  please do n't confuse me with that gobshite , we could n't be more different !, 
  i 'm pretty sure we 've been a net contributor since 2014 , and definitely are now and will continue to be , and most irish people have no issue with that at all , considering how much we got from the eu , and how much we gain from the single market . 
  the kdb is of * some * benefit to companies engaged in r&d , but no-where close to what they got out of the double irish , which i am glad is being removed by the way , but which i would point out was far from the sole responsibility of ireland ... 
  i mean , it absolutely is important , you saying it is n't does n't really carry any weight i 'm afraid . 
  it 's really hilarious how this is being framed as a `` favour '' somehow , it 's not , it 's reality ... 
  no , they 're not , eu , us , then uk ... 
  [ my information indicates that ireland has been a net contributor since 2014 ] ( http://m.independent.ie/business/irish/ireland-contributes-more-money-than-it-gets-to-eu-for-first-time-34815450.html ) the double irish was identified as an issue , and is now being ceased . 
  i 'm not really sure what you meant by your last line there , i 'm merely correcting the two assertions you made about ireland 's contributor status and the double irish ... also , the knowledge development box is far from a substitute for the double irish ... 
  ireland has been a net contributor for several years , the double irish is no longer possible for new companies since 2015 , and will be phased out by 2020 for existing ones . 
  no , that 's just realism , the eu is going to have one border with the uk , through ireland , quite an important matter no ? 
  villages ? 
  bruges , luxembourg , etc are villages now ? 
  well , it wo n't , and it absolutely would not be the best option , it would undermine , if not destroy , the entire basis for the single market , freedom of goods , capital and services without freedom of movement would do untold damage to the accession states , and would never be accepted by them , or by countries like ireland for that matter ...
