  that * you had agreed and signed up to in advance * ?!? 
  you call * that * bullying ? 
  never going to happen , you 're absolutely deluded if you believe that the uk can have anything approaching the benefits of the single market without fom . 
  if that 's what you 're holding out for , you are truly sorely mistaken . 
  ireland is there , in the middle ... 
  ouch , right in the human rights !, 
  well , turkey is off most people 's lists , so is egypt , tunisia , etc. 
  i do n't see that changing anytime soon , should benefit tourism in iberia , italy and greece ( and croatia !, 
  it 's the friday of a bank holiday weekend , and my comment was a joke , in other words : tl ; dr and * yawn * ... 
  he was accurate and concise anyway ... 
  hitler was n't from ireland , silly ... 
  [ ireland ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_republic_of_ireland ) [ south korea ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/south-korea/gdp-per-capita ), 
  now you 're just trolling chief , weak sauce ... 
  well , now you know better !, 
  and before you ever possibly visit ireland , so bonus , you 'll live !, 
  [ of course not !, 
  see also , the birmingham six and the guildford four ... 
  you should check out * calvary * same kind of vibe , if a bit darker ... 
  nah man , it has to be [ gubu ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/gubu ) , a multiple murderer finally being caught by the police * in the attorney general 's house * ?!, 
  only in ireland ... 
  yeah , there 's not many in the dail actually going to irish classes i 'd say ... 
  varadkar has a bit of gaeilge in fairness to him , and has been improving it the last few years ... edit : autocorrect, 
  it being nearly cut off from the rest of the country by the border does n't help either ... 
  the borders of the uk did change , ireland won independence ... 
  ireland rounds as well now ... 
  could n't give a shite , pretty sure our president 's an atheist and i could n't tell you what religion our prime minister is , if any ... 
  not really , when you get down to brass tacks , the easter rising was a military uprising against the british , celebrating that in any real sense while the troubles were happening just would n't have been politically possible ... 
  loads of irish as well , terry wogan , graham norton , dara o'briain ... 
  yeah , i think the troubles caused easter monday to be downplayed , hopefully that changes ... 
  our national day is probably the most widely celebrated in the world i 'd say , sometimes in a very cringey fashion , but it 's fun to see parades and events all around the globe ... 
  do n't forget going to the gaeltacht , or german/french college ... 
  you could n't imagine [ this ] ( http://c2.thejournal.ie/media/2017/02/14956059_1194890970557295_7086391295141469707_n-752x501.jpg ) fella getting big approval ratings ? 
  do you not see him there ? 
  on his little bike ? 
  beats some royal any day of the week imo ... 
  ireland dude : horse , skin , a mhac , awesome : deadly , savage , gas , bang on , fierce , tasty ,, 
  fair enough , but fifa decided that , not another country !, 
  but we do n't ? 
  republic of ireland is only used for soccer , and that 's because of northern ireland , it 's called ireland for everything else ... 
  how 's that ? 
  yeah , here in the republic we have christmas , stephens , new year 's , good friday and easter monday and paddy 's , then a may , june , august and october bank holiday , so 10 , but good friday is a bit of a grey area , a lot of businesses close , as does the civil service , but banks dont ( afaik ), 
  i was wondering why you mentioned st andrews and not paddy 's actually , that explains it !, 
  also st patrick 's day in ni ... 
  i 've done a long weekend in in ny before , as have friends , i would n't call us rich off the back of it though ... 
  all road signs in ireland are in both irish and english by law , in some gaeltacht areas where irish is the majority language the signs are in irish only ... 
  honestly , all the `` l '' counties are a bit shit , and never trust anyone from a county without a coastline ... 
  i thought that was carlow ? 
  leitrim exists , it 's just unfortunate that that is the case ... 
  for the pension you do not have to be resident . 
  for social welfare you have to regularly check/sign in , can be contacted regarding job opportunities , and have to be available for training or education , i think there may also be some kind of checks regarding people travelling so i 'm not sure . 
  ireland being an island , it 's not as trivial a thing to travel to another country as it is on mainland europe ... 
  pretty sure you have to be resident in ireland to claim social welfare . 
  a lot of pensioners move abroad though , the base state pension without extras or an additional private pension is $ 230 per week ... 
  ja and jb are the same amount at the max [ rate ] ( http://www.welfare.ie/en/pages/jobseekers-supports.aspx ), 
  yeah , ireland is n't cheap , but there 's a definite problem with a lack of incentive to work in some cases ... 
  $ 190 per week for a single unemployed person , indefinitely , plus housing benefit , child benefit , single parent family benefit and family income supplement for single parents/parents . 
  ireland has one of the most generous social welfare systems in the world . 
  err , the uk does n't have stv for westminster elections , they have fptp ... 
  a landswap , say , i dunno , 6 counties , they can go first , cos we 're cool that way ... 
  well , that and abortion , so it looks like we 'll be grabbing our own third rail pretty soon !, 
  north ( north north ) - nutjobs , may get explodey if deprived of flegs . 
  kerry - stupid , hayseeds , like to consume alcohol and drive cars as a means of expressing their culture cork - separatist region , unjustified yet unbreakable belief in their superiority over all other parts of the country cavan - cheap fuckers , shite accent galway - hippies and drunk students , the odd gaelgoir and wild connamara man wexford - strawberries and shit accents limerick - would you like to be stabbed ? 
  all the other `` l '' counties - just universally shit and inbred , there are no good `` l '' counties in ireland dublin - scumbags and west brits , there is no greater insult in ireland than to be referred to as british . 
  the not so affectionate term for dublin people in the rest of ireland is `` jackeens '' , because when the rest of the country turned it 's back on british royalty visiting , the people of dublin lined the streets with little union jack 's , `` een '' at the end of a word in ireland being a diminutive ... 
  northern ireland is n't similar to ireland ? 
  could have fooled me ... 
  ehm , northern ireland ? 
  the uk is n't our biggest trading partner anymore , and , having been around for the lisbon treaty , i 'm unsure as to how being given the opportunity to vote on the matter again after the concerns of irish people were addressed ( concerns which were conflated and twisted by the anti-treaty side and ineffectually addressed by the pro-treaty side ) constitutes bullying . 
  the eu has been fantastic for ireland , and will continue to be so , certainly far better for ireland than being some kind of economic satellite of an increasingly nationalist uk , cut off from our largest trading partners ... 
  80 % support for the eu in ireland , you wo n't be unsurprised anytime soon ... 
  we do n't value hate speech though , i 'm happier with our attitude ... 
  great movie !, 
  brilliant acting from ddl as usual , and he really nailed the accent of course ... 
  there you go !, 
  it 's great fun , you might struggle with the cork accent if you 're not irish though !, 
  really ? 
  that sucks , i thought it was available all over , it ca n't have cost netflix that much to get the rights ... 
  great flick , real natural feel to it ... 
  young offenders is on netflix , it 's actually pretty funny !, 
  i 'd say the commitments , intermission , the guard or calvary for a real irish feel , leaving aside historical movies like michael collins or the wind that shakes the barley ... 
  ahh , madame guillotine !, 
  that seems like the most sensible option , death to all tyrants !, 
  we 'll see , i just think that they 're lucky , getting * two * referendums in a few years , we had to shoot our way out , shit buzz ... 
  scotland is in the uk chief ... 
  not the uk . 
  have a good paddy 's day yourself !, 
  look up the history of ireland if you think you 're alone in that ... 
  i 'm interested to hear replies to this myself ... 
  arts graduates ... 
  for those [ downvoting ] ( https://youtu.be/6zkl91lzcmc ) ... 
  [ paul o'connell ] ( http://www.ilovelimerick.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/paul-oconnell.jpg ) , the rugby player , it is rumoured that superman wears paul o'connell pyjamas . 
  he 's also a [ smart ] ( https://youtu.be/zuajbxx9omi ) fucker ... 
  definitely do , slow paced but great fun , * very * irish in tone , well worth a watch !, 
  the dole is $ 188 , bit of a silly figure that , i mean , you 'd earn just shy of $ 400 pw gross on minimum wage ... 
  yup , same director as calvary and the guard too !, 
  have you seen those ? 
  great flicks !, 
  [ love/hate ] ( http://m.imdb.com/title/tt1625724/ ) [ paths to freedom ] ( http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0272404/ ) [ intermission ] ( http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0332658/?ref=m_nv_sr_1 ) [ i went down ] ( http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0126344/?ref=m_nv_sr_1 ) [ garage ] ( http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0878674/ ) [ the commitments ] ( http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0101605/ ), 
  set in ireland , with irish actors , about the irish war of independence , so 50/50 i 'd say , great film nonetheless ... 
  brexit , who 'll replace the taoiseach , all to be followed by a nice , calm , abortion referendum at some point , just to bring us all together as a nation again ...
