  the craic ... you can have fun in other countries , but you ca n't have the craic ... 
  no , and there 's a lot of historical baggage with referring to ireland as `` eire '' ... 
  corned beef and cabbage, 
  would 've gone with paddy or pat myself but yeah ... 
  do , come on over , we 're big fans of the poles over here as well , you 're a sound bunch of lads ... 
  r/ireland is pretty good , plenty of shitposting , not the most representative of ireland politically , but pretty bang on for our attitude towards life and sense of humour , just passed 100,000 subs as well , my favourite [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/3dpuxy/visiting_your_beautiful_country_this_weekend_want/ ), 
  i mean , so would ian paisley ... 
  [ err ] ( https://youtu.be/zg9n3ypn9i8 ) ... 
  dunno , roy keane and robbie keane were pretty well known in their day , also , wellington ? 
  ( i know , we do n't like him and he did n't like us , he was still irish-ish ), 
  also called that in ireland . 
  i saw [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/mofozem.png ) and i thought of you !, 
  be sound , for the boys in green, 
  you 're not really helping yourself here buddy, 
  ooh , mean !, 
  this thread is just a bit of fun chief , i would n't be getting so whingy , makes you look like a humourless eejit . 
  [ anyway ] ( http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1497/production/_86217250_berlusconi.jpg ) , i have no idea what would have made me doubt italians [ intelligence ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/31/15/37c16bf700000578-3767201-image-a-60_1472653614419.jpg ) ... 
  people like us ... 
  to be fair , i 'm not sure the italians are in a position to be criticising national intelligence ... 
  we are our own unique type of cunt , utterly unrelated to the class of cunt that england produces on an industrial basis ... 
  better quality of cunt over here though ... 
  and we are n't a pack of cunts , there 's that part too , small difference i know ... 
  no bother , thought was being ridiculous enough by mentioning robert the bruce !, 
  i was making a wee joke pally , obviously not a very good one !, 
  did you just call us english ?!, 
  i 'll fuckin ' fight ye , robert the bruce or no robert the bruce ... 
  well , if you 're in the uk , come over to ireland for a few days , couple of days in dublin then head over to galway or cork ( galway would be my recommendation , but cork is great too ) ... 
  or wales ... 
  the auld ' sod does n't sound particularly appealing but there you go ... 
  errr ... 
  thanks for devaluing your currency so that we can import cheap shit ? 
  slob , bog , boycott , brogue , clock , craic , galore , hooligan , lough , phoney , slogan , smithereens , tory and whiskey , there 's a pile more as well ... 
  ca n't beat a good aul ' gagglefuck though ... 
  * fight, 
  the [ great famine ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_famine_ ( ireland ) ), 
  scottish , french, 
  yeah , fuckin ' triggered over here , ** europa is best continent , all other continents inferior !, 
  that `` europeans with vehicles '' thing was a bit odd , i mean , most european adults would have a car , or access to one . 
  anyway , yes , people are always hopping over the border to northern ireland for stuff , and vice-versa . 
  it would be quite common now for example with the exchange rate for people to travel from pretty far to do their `` big christmas shop '' , importing cars would be common enough as well , though there is a tax on that , a lot of the time it can still be a 10-20 % net saving ... 
  well , we 're next door in ireland , have equally shite weather , and i would n't call us `` mentally cold '' ... 
  i do , were the flemish and walloons blowing each other up with the active participation of the french army in war crimes ? 
  belgium is not comparable to ni , some serious shit went down there , for a long time , well within living memory , it 's not two different cultures in one country , it 's two similar cultures who fucking despise each other ( by european standards ) living in an artificial statelet designed to give one of them a majority , said majority is disappearing steadily , the only comparable country in my view is yugoslavia ... 
  it really is n't a runner tbh , and has near zero support in ni , unionists would never accept it as they would n't be part of the uk , which is their entire identity , and nationalists would just use it as an excuse to reunite with ireland ... 
  nah , and independent ni would be the least likely outcome , it 's completely unable to support itself , and completely divided on a level waaay above belgium . 
  it 's also not legally possible , under the good friday agreement the possibilities are to either remain in the uk or reunification with ireland . . 
  well , there would be * some * ( not many at all ) catholics who vote for the uup , for example . 
  there 's also the alliance party . 
  there are protestant nationalists and catholic unionists in ni , just not many of either ... 
  well , no catholic would vote for the dup anyway , both the sdlp and sinn fein are left , the dup are fairly hard right . 
  you are correct though , there is no even centre-right party in the north for catholics/nationalists to vote for , that 's not going to change anytime soon though ... 
  christ no , sinn fein has always been left , they were marxists for a good while , honestly , a lot of irish revolutionary/nationalist thought has been leftist , considering that the fight was against the uk that is hardly a surprise no ? 
  how does it have the hallmarks of a far-right party ? 
  from the [ wiki ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sinn_f\u00e9in ) `` sinn f\u00e9in currently is considered a democratic socialist or left-wing party . 
  [ 85 ] in the european parliament , the party aligns itself with the european united left -- nordic green left ( gue/ngl ) parliamentary group . 
  the party pledges support for minority rights , migrants ' rights , and eradicating poverty . '', 
  ff and fg are basically centrists , and renua were a good bit further right than them , and consisted mainly at the time of fgers who 'd left/been kicked out over their objection to any relaxation of abortion legislation . 
  of course , they were roundly rejected , who knows what they consist of now ... 
  sinn fein is not right wing , it 's left wing , and populist , nationalist parties/movements in ireland tend to be left wing , which is not the norm , i know ... 
  also , ireland , no far right party ( of any note , that anyone has ever elected someone from ) here , the closest we came to were [ renua ] ( http://www.renuaireland.com ) and they were destroyed in the last election , and were n't far right by any real metric ... 
  it 's the business ... 
  redbreast, 
  last christmas the mod team , who had been steadily becoming more and more of a pain in the ass , removing comments they did n't like , arbitrarily banning people , went full on power mad 1984 . 
  there was a user revolt , mass resignation , a few account deletions , and we got a new mod team who leave us the fuck alone for the most part and are actually pretty sound . 
  basic enough stuff ... 
  oh we have the best arguments , * the best * !, 
  oh i remember the christmas mod war very well , we lost a lot of ~ ~ good ~ ~ men ... 
  join us ? 
  we 'll make him a mod !, 
  also , bean an t\u00ed 's , no other country has those either ... 
  also , conflating the troubles as `` catholics versus protestants '' ... 
  thought so !, 
  i have family from that area , when i was visiting as a kid on a sunday we used to take the effin road to the effin church , to listen to the effin priest ... 
  you sure you 're not talking about effin with that limerick one ? 
  it portrayed devalera very innacurately , apart from that , a good movie . 
  the wind that shakes the barley would probably be more accurate tbh ... 
  as long as it 's the year when it 's $ 5.99 i 'm happy !, 
  dunno , the $ 5.99 pinot grigio in tescos is n't half bad tbh ... 
  the national museum is a great way to spend a day , you 're right , i suppose the book of kells in dublin is a bit like the mona lisa in paris , long queues , ticked off the list and on to the next item , december might be a bit handier though queuewise . 
  it all depends on what op is interested in , something like the guided tour of glasnevin cemetery might interest him if he likes history , or if music 's his thing there 'll be loads of good gigs on around that time , probably need a bit more info from op ... 
  no problem , there 's lots to see in ireland , do you guys have any particular interests/things you like to see generally ? 
  i could give you a few tips based on that ... 
  you wo n't be able to get marijuana under any ( legal ) circumstance in ireland . 
  recommended sights in dublin ( you do n't say how long you 'll be staying or where so i 'm assuming you 're staying in dublin ) would be the book of kells , guinness storehouse , kilmainham jail , and trinity college library . 
  if you 're actually visiting the * real * ireland let me know and i 'll give you a few pointers , also , check out r/irishtourism , its a reddit archive featuring piles of reddit threads from people asking for advice on things to do and places to visit , loads of info there as well ... 
  well , we also have `` feck '' , we 're an adaptable people so we are ... 
  not sure , we do n't have tizer over here ... 
  [ this ] ( http://cdn.thejournal.ie/embeds/twitter/87885df8858a916e5513d914f1a812f8.png ) is lemonade in ireland , its fizzy , we also have red lemonade , which is n't common elsewhere , its a chemical mess beloved by children and people who want a cheap mixer for their vodka ... 
  the west of ireland is the real ireland honestly , dublin is just another city with some interesting museums and good pubs , if you 're ever over again try the coast up from cork as far as sligo/donegal depending on time available ... 
  staying in dublin too long , all you need there is two , three days tops ... 
  ehm , do you want to reread that ? 
  i 'm not being funny , but i 've no idea what you 're trying to say , apart from some ridiculously uninformed dig at the end ... 
  `` a few thousand '' ?? 
  [ 1.3 million ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911 ) asylum claims in the eu ( and norway and switzerland ) alone in 2015 , in * addition * to non asylum immigration , are you trolling ? 
  err , have you heard of the syrian refugee crisis at all ? 
  i 've seen it mentioned in the news , from time to time , easy to miss in fairness ... 
  the craic ... 
  yeah , burned into my brain that was , $ 1.27 to the pound , i think the novelty of having a new currency got most people using it pretty quickly , * loads * of bullshit `` what 's that in real money '' jokes though , iirc ... 
  yeah , that one was a real `` fuck you '' , however , the troubles were still going strong at that stage , and it was right around the hunger strikes , thatcher was ( and is ) * despised * in ireland ... 
  you 'd see some outside some international corporate hotels , not so much anywhere else , that said , not sure how many irish flags you 'd see flying in the uk !,
