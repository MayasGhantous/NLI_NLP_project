  snackbox on your way home , a happy man ... 
  yeah , i 'm from ireland but lived in cincinnati for a bit , fuck the summers in that part of the country , humid as hell and nasty , i 'd take an irish summer any day ... 
  raining three days a week is a good summer in ireland ... 
  they 've softened it a lot since they realised it was n't a popular stance ... 
  it can get crowded , yes , but older people ( who tend to vote in high numbers ) normally vote during the day , you do n't see queues around the block like you sometimes do during the day ... 
  yeah , and i would n't vote for those fuckers either !, 
  before transfers its more than a bit lopsided , the issue at hand is that fine gael is proposing across the board tax cuts that will disproportionately benefit the wealthy , throwing things out of balance , and leading to the kind of narrowing of the tax base that contributed to our economic crash ( in my view ), 
  polls are open till 10pm , gives time for people to vote after work or coming home from college ... 
  ireland has a pretty progressive and fair personal tax system after transfers ... 
  labour did n't do too badly with what they had to deal with over here either , they restored social welfare payments , pushed through the marriage equality legislation , and tempered fine gael 's more torylike tendencies , but they were savaged by the left and blamed by the electorate , its not fair in a lot of ways . 
  a good chunk of the irish electorate seems to believe that if you compromise on * anything * as a junior partner in an coalition that you 've betrayed the voters . 
  we 're no strangers to coalition government but we do n't seem to grasp what it entails ... 
  so a gun-runner and two gombeens , fml ... 
  no , not in the sense of the uk liberal party , the closest we have to them would be our labour party , ( or perhaps the social democrats but they 're very new ) which has drifted towards the centre while sinn fein stole their lunch on the left ... 
  thanks chief !, 
  hi , i 've resubmitted it , but added ireland to the title because it was n't mentioned in the headline , is that ok ? 
  while not having much truck with greece 's current government , or their strategies over the last few years , this is a completely different matter . 
  europe has completely and utterly let greece down in this , there 's no sense of urgency in dealing with this crisis , and no sense of unity , if the brits were looking for ways in which the eu is failing , this is it ... 
  that 's about it , ni has the ethnic conflict twist as well : * what are you ? 
  * * i 'm an atheist actually * * right , right , but are you a **** protestant *** atheist or a ** catholic ** one ? 
  * only in ni is that a conversation that could quite reasonably happen ... 
  yeah , i saw that , he still features a few times , all for irish related trolling as it happens !, 
  well if the quiet part is population density its right for ireland , wrong for the uk , which is quite densely populated ... 
  10 and 14 not the most accurate for ireland , we 're hardly quiet , nor are we protestant ... 
  check him out on u/removalbot !, 
  it 's hilarious !, 
  nope , well known around these parts ... 
  nope , he * hates * us , makes me laugh , looks like he might have deleted his account , he 'll be back though , and with greater bitterness , like a crap british sandperson ... 
  we got guarantees with respect to the fears raised , and then voted for the revised treaty presented to the irish people ? 
  mods ? 
  here ? 
  lol . 
  he 's been doing this for ages , you should see the stuff he deletes !, 
  over which we will have a veto through referendum at every stage , i do n't see the problem tbh ... 
  well , at least i do n't delete my posts after spewing racism around the place , off you pop now , troll ... 
  this guy is a well known racist troll , most of us do n't bother with him anymore . 
  the current theory is that an irishman gave his ol' mum a delivery up the back passage ... 
  do n't bother , well known anti-irish racist , posts here on the regular ... edit : aaand u/citee _ londinius deletes his post again , like clockwork , silly little troll ... 
  we 're not talking about catholic rule of protestant countries though , are we ? 
  we 're talking about british rule of ireland , and glorious `` british democracy '' . 
  the penal laws and their predecessors and successors were `` mild '' ? 
  in relation to what ? 
  the spanish inquisition ? 
  source for wealthy protestants leaving ireland in their droves during the famine ? 
  i fully understand the greater european historical period , please provide and example of a famine close to the scale of the great famine in 18th century europe , i await it with rapt attention ... 
  before or after it was bribed out of existence ? 
  you do n't see the difference between a protestants ruling a protestant country and a catholic one ? 
  because the difference , as i 'm sure you 're extensive studies would have shown , is quite stark , resulting in a few million dead people . 
  `` nationalist imagination '' , i 'm afraid you have that confused with facts my friend , i hope you did n't approach your irish studies with this lack of academic rigour , as i would would fear for your final result , unless they give extra points for whitewashing your ancestors crimes in the uk ? 
  maybe they do , i would n't know , different curriculum , thank god ... 
  the protestant middle class left ireland during the famine ? 
  that , i 'm afraid , is not correct , they were too busy profiting from food sales to the mainland uk and the like while their neighbours ( not countrymen , i 'm sure you know they did n't consider themselves irish ) died in the fields and streets in their millions . 
  great way to thin the herd of serfs , a famine , of course , they 're * such * unpredictable things , you can never tell if decades of laws prohibiting catholic ownership of land , outright theft of resources , banning education , and absentee landlords will bring one about . 
  that 's why you have to ensure that when one * does * come about you chalk it up to market forces and hold your hands up saying '' whoops !, 
  how did that ever happen '' , absolving yourself of all blame and guilt , for other examples , ask a bengal . 
  of course , for maximum effect , you * must * keep exporting food while you 're doing this , would n't want any english bellies grumbling , would we ? 
  if full fiscal union entails the removal of the ability to set our own tax rates its a non starter , you and i both know that , but we 're a hell of a long way from that ... 
  thankfully now out of print ... 
  ireland is one of the most pro-eu countries there is , there 's not a single anti-eu political party , even after the last 5 years , i do n't see any treaty not passing unless it infringed on tax sovereignty or defence ... 
  `` the big book of denying democracy to others , particularly if they 're brown or irish '' there 's several volumes ... 
  the irish parliament until 1801 ( when it was bribed by the british into disolving itself ) `` in 1720 , a westminster act known as `` the sixth of george i '' gave the british parliament the right to pass laws for ireland . 
  the only weapon of the irish house of commons , now wholly protestant and largely controlled by wealthy landlords , was its powers of taxation . '', 
  `` the british government were undemocratic thieves to their own people too ! '', 
  great argument for british `` democracy '' 3 . 
  `` british policies of theft , murder , and subjugation along with the targeted attempt at the destruction of irish culture caused many people to flee ireland '' not sure what your point is there 4 . '', 
  ... being altogether beyond the power of man , the cure had been applied by the direct stroke of an all-wise providence in a manner as unexpected and as unthought of as it is likely to be effectual . 
  the judgement of god sent the calamity to teach the irish a lesson , that calamity must not be too much mitigated . 
  ... the real evil with which we have to contend is not the physical evil of the famine , but the moral evil of the selfish , perverse and turbulent character of the people . '', 
  charles trevelyan , head of administration for famine relief , 1840s of course , you know all that , being the student of irish history that you are , you were , of course , not trying to put a gloss on the brutal british treatment of ireland to assuage your own feeling of national pride , that would be ahistorical ... 
  oh , i was n't having an issue with the balance , its just that he said in the video that only british citizens can vote , and i thought the juxtaposition of the other part was a bit odd , just my 2c ... 
  irish citizens can also vote in the referendum if they live in the uk , also , having the voiceover say `` the eu for decades has dictated to the uk about nearly everything '' while the graphic shows that only 53 % of uk laws are eu derived is , well , a bit inconsistent . . 
  so did i , odd ... 
  and we have n't even joined in yet !, 
  who would be asking those questions ? 
  certainly not irish people ... 
  its a shame for them , but it was never likely that we 'd both get out of the group , could still have happened going in to the last few games though . 
  you know , its weird , i do n't mind `` home nations '' at all !, 
  i throw a major strop at `` british isles '' but `` home nations '' does n't have any negative connotations for me , i think it 's quite a nice way of phrasing things ... 
  they had a tough group in fairness , though they did shoot themselves in the foot a bit , and could hardly have expected that the mighty ireland would get a win and a draw from the germans ... 
  his intentions are quite clear , the guy is an asshole . 
  you do realise the origin of the link between ireland and potatoes ? 
  `` joking '' to an irish person about potatoes is the equivalent of `` joking '' to a jew about zyklon b, 
  what possible other reason could the person i was responding to have had for making a `` potatoes '' joke than to mock the deaths of millions of my countrymen under british rule ? 
  he can go fuck himself , if you dish it out , you get it back ... 
  well , i was just responding in kind to the dickhead above me , i do n't really think it 's funny ... 
  * yawns * , boring , here 's a proper joke for you : what 's the difference between brits and smarties ? 
  smarties do n't melt in the tube !, 
  yeah , shag off , there 's a good moron ... 
  ah , bigotry and ignorance , how unsurprising ... 
  you have a lot to be ashamed of as well , and the arrogant attitude you are displaying is certainly representative of the certain sector of british society that many dislike ... 
  i agree 100 % , i 'm far from a republican , it just irks me when i hear one side , normally the ira , being picked out as `` having gotten away with it '' , its quite prevalent in certain sections of the british press . 
  there 's people walking around , loyalist , republican , and british army who should be in jail , but it was the only way peace could be achieved ... 
  depends what you define unhelpful as , if you think it was unhelpful to not be overly receptive to a british state that was itself involved in murders , bombings , and collusion in terrorism then no , ireland was n't very helpful . 
  why would ireland be helpful to a state that was unlawfully killing irish people ? 
  and also normally omit the british soldiers who murdered people who are also walking the streets ... 
  in fairness to the french , one out of four ai n't bad , against the germans . 
  the brits and the yanks ( and a few others ) have them beat on that of course , but there you go ... 
  i 've read 7 % ... 
  '' `` other sovereign countries that have such low tax rates and lax regulation that they ** can ** be considered ** semi-tax havens ** are : '' ireland is n't a tax haven , we have a transparent , low corporation tax system , that is n't a tax haven . 
  it can be annoying on here sometimes , getting the phrase thrown at you by be people who do n't understand its meaning , not that i 'm saying you are doing that . .
