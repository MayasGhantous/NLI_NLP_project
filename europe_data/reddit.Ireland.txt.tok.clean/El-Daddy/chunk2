  no one is planning on stopping orange marches or start burning union jacks or anything . 
   ( vi ) recognise the birthright of all the people of northern ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as irish or british , or both , as they may so choose , and accordingly confirm that their right to hold both british and irish citizenship is accepted by both governments and would not be affected by any future change in the status of northern ireland .

  i do n't think you know the difference between what a `` nation '' or `` state '' is . 
  it 's part of the good friday agreement . 
  residents of ni have a right to both irish and british citizenship , regardless of the constitutional status of ni . 
  love this one . 
  i really wish there was a proper recording of this performance . 
  to be pedantic , the normans who arrived in ireland were very much cambro-normans rather than anglo-normans ... they were almost all from wales and the west coast . 
  i love seeing the tr\u00eddhathach in unexpected places !, 
  i guess my problem was the disconnect between your thoughts on how it 's ok for st patrick 's saltire to be used in the union jack , but not on the harp to be used in the coat of arms . 
  the harp itself was only ever used as a symbol for ireland under british rule , be it through the `` lordship of ireland '' or `` kingdom of ireland '' . 
  ( as we both know , only later on in the years did their authority actually stretch beyond the pale , but you get what i mean . ), 
  i am a big fan of our current usage of the harp since gaining independence , ~ ~ but it 's origins are n't gaelic . ~ ~ ( ok so i looked up a few [ references ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_ireland#cite_note-nli-8 ) while writing this comment and it turns out it 's more ambiguous than that , so thanks for making me look it up !, 
  disregard previous stuff ! ), 
   from mediaeval times the harp has been regarded as the heraldic symbol of ireland . 
  as such it is illustrated in the  armorial wijnbergen , a thirteenth century roll of arms now preserved in the hague . 
   the same source gives the blazon ,  or technical description , of the arms of ireland as follows :  * le roi d\u2019irlande : d\u2019azure \u00e0 la harpe d\u2019or . 
  *  these arms may appertain to an aspirational high kingship after the norman invasion . 
  certainly they were never the  arms of the lordship of ireland . 
   so yeah , i 'd be happy to claim it is an irish invention . 
  as for the current uk coat of arms , i would n't go as far to saying that it represents a claim over ireland . 
  i think it 's simply easier to keep the old part of the crest representing ireland and have that represent the part of ireland that falls under their jurisdiction . 
  if the 6 counties were indeed all of ulster , as some people like to pretend , then it would be a different story - the red hand would be the more appropriate choice . 
  i 'd also like to see the harp off the coat of arms and st patrick 's saltire off of the union jack in the near future - though perhaps for additional reasons !, 
  tbh lad i 'm just confused at this stage . 
  you 're getting all sorts of things mixed up and then changing what we 're talking about with each comment . 
  nope , the coat of arms of ireland is a golden harp on a blue background , the exact same description of what formerly represented all of ireland in the uk 's crest . 
  it 's also used as the presidential standard here , when it 's in a flag rather than a crest . 
  golden harp on a green background is the coat of arms of leinster . 
  i think the harp crest itself is class , but it 's also a british creation . 
  whenever we had a high king of our own they were more associated with the flag of whatever province they were from . 
  the harp being used as a symbol of ireland done when henry viii named himself king of ireland . 
  the saltire serves the same purpose as the harp does on the coat of arms . 
  how could you be happy with one and not the other ? 
  ... sounds good to me !, 
  what about st patrick 's saltire on the union jack so ? 
  ukraine 's one is just so cool . 
  i love the rurikid link . 
  the harp represents ni . 
  if that is the case , it 's pretty bad form on the part of the propagandists . 
  irish republicanism and nationalism has been secular and inclusive from the onset , just look at wolfe tone , robert emmet , grattan , mccracken . 
  and of course parnell . 
  i ca n't say definitively that it is the case , but it is a widely-held theory . 
  must 've had some gom of a primary school teacher . 
  it 's fine in limited poetic usage , depending on the audience . 
  definitely not where someone could read it and not know any better . 
  it was never green , white and gold . 
  green represents the old gaelic traditions , and the republicanism of the united irishmen from the 1790s . 
  orange represents the supporters of william of orange and the irishmen who associate themselves with him . 
  white represents peace . 
  `` green , white and gold '' is commonly believed to be a unionist / pro-british propaganda , with white and gold being the colours of the papacy , as they believed that ireland was in most senses ruled from rome . 
  other than that , i think you 're dead on when it comes to culture . 
  we 're pretty good at assimilation . 
  yes . 
  and an oft-repeated one because of the attractive alliteration . 
  see [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ov9wx/real_average_gdp_growth_in_years_20052015/dcmoy5n/ ) . 
  blame the pale . . big population base right there . 
  dublin is far worse than it should be , but especially considering what you 're getting i would n't put it nearly on london levels . 
  hon the lads, 
  not at all actually , but / r/pasglop explained it well . 
  the gaelic languages originated in ireland and the brythonic languages in britain . 
  your foresight is commendable . 
  i was just letting you know more out of interest  the accent on irish up there is hilarious though . 
  when i was in school and we were doing aural tests listening to recordings , there was always a speaker donegal or the like , and the class pretty much always gave an audible groan when they came on . 
  i still remember what one of them started off with . . '' * is mise se\u00e1n de paor , is mise an duine is sine sa chlann * . . '' very understandable , just so distinctive . 
  ulster irish a dialect/accent , definitely not a distinct language , there 's very few differences . 
  it 's londain in standard irish too . 
  for anyone that does n't know , scots gaelic is * very * similar to the irish language ( we call it gaeilge ) . 
  scots gaelic derived from old irish , but even nowadays their descendants are pretty much mutually intelligible . 
  anyway . . interestingly , in ayrshire in south-western scotland , there is also a town that is also called \u00c1th cliath in scots gaelic , but its name in anglicized as hurlford . 
  oooh , interesting . 
  well with a more enabled parliament , the land acts and the transfer of land ownership could 've ended up happening in the pre-famine era , getting rid of the whole ascendency absentee-landlordism and pauperism that you describe , and they were the root the problem to begin with . 
  of course had we gotten independence in 1798 in the first place . . now that 'd be all a very different ireland . 
  so you 're saying that if there was no 1798 , then the act of union would n't 've occurred , and grattan 's parliament would 've been able to mitigate more of the effects than westminster did ? 
  a lot of this depends on whether or not there was catholic emancipation or not . 
   the irish were in their position because they were rebellious and failed to liberate themselves . 
  there was a price for that . 
   if the potato blight had seriously affected the uk as well ireland was part of the uk at the time . 
  it was supposed to be one of the constituent countries of it , the richest country in the world at the time , and it still happened . 
  before ireland was ~ ~ fully annexed ~ ~ added , it was the kingdom of great britain , not the uk . 
  i love the window seat that looks into right into tara st station , so you can see the poor feckers commuting as you enjoy your friday afternoon guinnesses . 
  nope , not at all actually . 
  gaelic literally means `` of the gaels '' , gaels being the celtic natives of ireland . 
  scots gaelic as a language is descended from old irish , as irish people settled in western scotland in the 500s/600s , forming a kingdom of `` d\u00e1l riada '' . 
  what we know as scotland back then was called pictland , and the native picts ended up adopting the gaelic language and culture that had come over with the people of d\u00e1l riada . 
  the gaelic kingdom and pictish kingdom eventually combined , and became the kingdom of scotland . 
  the whole idea of `` scottish '' is basically taken from pictish adoption of gaelic culture/customs/language , which gradually changed over time and became more of it 's own thing , but the languages irish ( gaeilge ) , and scots gaelic themselves are very very similar . 
  the native pictish would 've spoken a `` brythonic '' language , which were also celtic languages , but native to britain as opposed to ireland . 
  it 'd be more similar to welsh than anything else . 
  did n't know that one , sitheach is n't in use in modern irish . 
  so yeah , whoever told you `` wolf '' is full of shite . 
  ah , it 's the same translation as macintyre and macateer . 
  in irish anyway it 's `` mac an tsaoir '' , which is literally `` son of the carpenter/craftsman '' . 
  the closest translation of the surname in english would probably be carpenter , or wright . 
  love this ad . 
  just give it an auld * yeeeeeoooooooo *, 
  i was actually going to go for leitrim , but then i forgot ... 
  let 's say roscommon costs more money than it brings in .
