celtic republic *, 
  different periods in irish mythology iirc , it goes mytological -  fenian -  ulster -  modern . 
  [ fionn maccumhaill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fionn_mac_cumhaill ) for the feinian cycle and [ c\u00fa chulainn/s \u00e9tanta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/c%c3%ba_chulainn ) for the ulster cycle . 
  alright , thanks . 
  dublin gaa , everyone outside of dublin has a friendly hatred for dublin, 
  p1q4 : it can be both , i feel these answers are restrictive, 
  i always feel the term `` irish nationalist '' has a very different meaning . 
  you often would associate nationalists with neo nazis or the sort , but in ireland , they 're often republican liberals who are just very passionate about their country . 
  i 'm a liberal , and i 'd definitely consider myself a patriot and , to an extent a nationalist . 
  i guess that nationalism is more liberal here due to our history . 
  brythonic celtic languages are fucking unintelligible like damn how d o you go from the 3 gaelic languages to the 3 brythonic languages ? 
  obviously michael d higgins, 
  you could probably get to see them all in a day tbh . 
  it 's still way cooler though and '' - land '' is pretty overused in english, 
  ireland is one of the only celtic place names in english to make sense , going from eire to ireland . 
  if you mean gaelic football or hurling , then gaelic football , and if you mean soccer or hurling , then still , soccer i think, 
  [ the only history books you 'll ever need ] ( https://www.amazon.com/ireland-horrible-histories-special-terry/dp/1407110225 ), 
  allright , thanks for the response , 
  live near an annual rally 's spot . 
  lots of young people in their cheap hatchbacks modded to shit every year . 
  we call them `` boy racers '' . 
  they 're cunts . 
  was n't aware that the uk drive on the right . 
  i used to say something like `` yeah , hello ? 
  '' , but i 've sped it up to the point that i now just answer the phone with the name of a colour, 
  do you think that ni could benefit from a option for a liberal or leftist unionist party ? 
  is there already one ? 
  or is this just not plausible ? 
  i 'd say at least 5 % of us speak english . 
  rough estimate though . 
  connor murphy would probably be the most generic irish name i can think of . 
  everybody know the first and last two lines , along with the tune . 
  in our defence , it 's in a language we do n't speak much . 
  sadly . 
  left lib -6 -5, 
  i havent read everything from him , but what i have read ( sormlight , emporers soul and the reckoners ) , have all had amazing magic systems . 
  i 've been meaning to read the first mistborn book , but christ the man writes faster than i can read . 
  yer not from ere yer from america, 
  sorry no , my parents were irish, 
  the potato blight of 1840 combined with the brits taking everything else really fucked us over . 
  ni thigim aon gaeilge ach spreche ich etwas deutch and i of course speak english, 
  the stormlight archive by brandon sanderson is great , interesting politics and landscape . 
  it is a bit cliched in the medieval stuff , but its magic system is pretty unique imo . 
  it just seems so odd , idk why it 's just an extremely strange thought for me , if i went to someone elses house and took off my shoes , i 'd feel in the wrong . 
  probably a city in austria or south germany if i had to , but i love ireland . 
  york s, 
  `` a burning issue '' damn wwf now 's not the time for jokes, 
  northern ireland ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  different eu countries have quite different foreign policies , so idk . 
  so a eurocentric european army ? 
  do n't have any gangster rap , but i do have [ the taoiseach dancing at a bruce springsteen concert ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcfwex-5aus ), 
  all harmless from what i know . 
  i 'm still terrified . 
  i 'm from ireland and i live nearby the naming inspiration , i always presumed from the name that it was irish , the skeelig islands are a fairly big landmark here . 
  i have a theory that every person in ireland has an aunt named mary . 
  we really do n't learn much at all about the crusades over here . 
  i guess it 's because of being mostly uninvolved and having our own thing going on separate to europe a lot in history . 
  can `` watching the badges '' please now become a euphemism for gay sex ? 
  [ the book of kells ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/book_of_kells ), 
  `` ar muin na muice '' means to be happy , but directly translates to `` on the pigs back '' i always found that quite funny . 
  well , henry viii was pretty bad and all , reforming the church and leaving religious tensions in ireland to last hundreds of years . 
  so it 's either him or cromwell . 
  some are good , some are bad would be the general thoughts . 
  we have a long history with christianity and it 's types , i personally do n't care for either of them . 
  if you 're from rural areas , you probably need a car , if you 're from a city , you may not . 
  that pretty much goes for everywhere, 
  damn ... 
  he 's changed, 
  praise be to johan !, 
  i saw this comment while listening to `` no bullets fly '' on spotify , 
  history , i love my country and i love learning more about it , even if some of the subjects are a bit taboo regarding the civil war and such . 
  irish, 
  i live near a national park , makes me remember why i fucking love this country every morning, 
  although vilnius looks much `` cleaner '' and more modern and almost sleek , i just think that kaunas has that happy gaudy christmas feeling . 
  you know ? 
  sabaton has to be one of my favourite bands at the moment . 
  wolfe tones , sabaton , and the beatles . 
  i would , just it 's fucking expensive and i 'm lazy . 
  if you 're feeling morbid , [ the river saile ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tllyag5ax3c ) is an old children 's song in ireland . 
  never been to orlando or cali , i have been to paris though , so i will continue to delude myself that paris is better until i get the option to go to orland/cali one day . 
  i can wholly relate to that whole going to a catholic school full of atheists thing , i 'd presume it 's very common nowadays . 
  most likely because of the old idea that being irish equates to being catholic , and people do n't think much past that . 
  mount & blade : napoleonic wars, 
  the `` britons '' were the celtic tribe in north england before the romans , angles , saxons , vikings etc came and replaced the celts in england with germanics, 
  i imagine that most people will just carry on with their days , save druggies . 
  that seems to be a common stereotype , i wonder how strongly it holds up . 
  it 's interesting how nationalism is usually really associated with conservatism , but in our country it seems to be reversed . 
  i once spilled my tea , complete disaster !, 
  that 's up to them i guess , 
  as long as you do n't take scotland , we need them for r/celticunion but some nords seem to like to claim that scotland is nordic , when they 're celtic . 
  not at all , we say hi by offering people tea , even if they are driving past on a highway at 120km/h . 
  and you 're expected to keep your promise about tea even then . 
  it 's in our constitution . 
  one of us , one of us , one of us , one of us , one of us !, 
  the secret of kells is pretty good too , and apparently that studio made another movie which is also quite good . 
  does seem that way does n't it . 
  she was just famously a bit of a cunt towards irish people , i understand that she brought reforms in the uk , but one of the best european leaders ? 
  thatcher ? 
  fucking really ? 
  personally i fucking hate nathan carter because he 's just a shit musician , but we also have a lot of scummy politicians , and are particularly famous for our pretentious musicians .
