france is like a dream to me , that 's how bad it is . 
  it simply does n't have power over services like education like everywhere else . 
  it has really impacted our politics . 
  people often vote for someone because `` they fixed the road '' since you have to go your td ( mp ) to get something done . 
  so now we have extremely bad planning with places getting facilities where they were not needed so the local politician can get some votes . 
  i have an entire system devised . 
  5 or 6 regions with powers in environment , health , planning and infrastructure . 
  and about 70 municipalities which would control education , social services , culture and other things . 
  if a united ireland happens , which it very likely in a couple decades there would be a real need for it . 
  i would envision there being two more regions ; east ulster and west ulster and then each region would have a certain number of representatives , with east ulster having more to give the unionists more influence and also a grouping for the diaspora . 
  the local government is something that really needs to be looked at . 
  we are the most centralised state in europe . 
  ireland does n't even have a proper level of municipal government . 
  the counties would be too big to be considered municipalities , but too small to be regions . 
  they have no real power apart housing . 
  but even if they wanted to do something different they would n't have the funding to do so . 
  pronunciation : bh = v , b ` fhearr = bjar , deo = joe , silent b in mbanjo . 
  translation : joe has a wife and joe has a banjo and joe 's wife has a banjo . 
  joe on the banjo would be better than joe 's wife on the banjo . 
  pronunciation : bhacaidh and bhacfaidh = vakee translation : do n't bother the son of the beggar and the son of the beggar wo n't bother you . 
  t\u00e1 bhur ng\u00e9 ag ithe \u00e1r ngas glas pronunciation : ng before e , \u00e9 , i or \u00ed = \u00f1 as in spanish , nh before a , \u00e1 , o , \u00f3 , u , \u00fa = ng as in ring , th = h. 
  translation : your goose are in our field . 
  our stem is your goose 's beak . 
  your goose is eating our green stem . 
  pronunciation : s before e , \u00e9 , i , \u00ed = sh , mh = v , ea = a as in cat . 
  translation : seven sitting chickens walking in the snow . 
  i have and never will need a gun . 
  even our police do n't have them . 
  did you practice irish and spanish outside of school or did you reach that just through the leaving cert ? 
  it is quite bad . 
  there is way too much rote learning instead of learning how to for proper sentences . 
  there is lack of emphasis on the spoken part of the language . 
  there are oral exams which are worth 40 % of your final exam , but most people just learn off answers instead of trying to make them up on the spot like in an actual conversation . 
  for the last two years the main focus is literature . 
  but the vast majority of people would n't be able to have a spontaneous conversation at that point . 
  there is also a common criticism of there being too much grammar , which is true . 
  but the real problem is they they correct you on grammar that you 've never learnt . 
  they teach it as if everybody is a native speaker when only a small minority would be . 
  but they really do need to teach the more complicated stuff due to irish grammar being so different and unique . 
  fortunately due to the rise of the gaelscoileanna and the gaelchol\u00e1ist\u00ed , there 's been an increase in irish being spoken outside of the gaeltacht . 
  but it 's far from becoming a regular language anywhere . 
  there needs to be serious reform if that is going to happen . 
  it goes h1 , h2 , h3 ... with a 10 % difference between each . 
  h stands for higher level . 
  if you do ordinary , it 's o1 , o2 , o3 ... less than a h6 or o6 is a fail . 
  i presume you mean subjects instead of the amount of classes in a day . 
  every student does english , irish and maths . 
  you only have to another three , but every school makes you do another one . 
  we have them all year round . 
  there are never any changes to the timetable within a year . 
  for their optional subjects a large majority do higher level . 
  classes are always mixed and start out at higher level but people sometimes drop to ordinary later on . 
  the higher level course is just the ordinary level one plus extra things . 
  for the compulsory subjects classes are usually separated . 
  if somebody starts out at higher level they can drop to an ordinary level class since they are always on at the same time . 
  for science no , there 's biology , chemistry , physics and agricultural science ( do n't ask ) . 
  for maths yes . 
  there 's also applied maths which is more the maths of physics . 
  it 's not a common subject and is usually done as an eighth subject after school . 
  they do n't exist in any way at leaving cert level ( the last two years of secondary school ) . 
  it 's something that i 've always liked so much about the american education system . 
  there is a year before the leaving cert called transition year which is meant to be a time where you can do stuff like that and things less academic . 
  but in reality nobody does and people usually just sit around doing nothing for the year . 
  classes of literally just sitting there talking would legitimately happen . 
  in transition year , homework is a foreign word , but after you get a lot . 
  from right to left ** bold ** fine gael ( clan of the gaels ) : ** bold ** currently the biggest party . 
  usually considered centre-right but they usually go into coalition with labour and end up being more at the centre . 
  most business people and farmers would vote for them . 
  for most other people it depends who their family supports . 
  ** bold ** fianna f\u00e1il ( warriors of f\u00e1l ) ** bold ** was the second most successful party in the western world before the recession . 
  it came first in every election , but then came third in 2011 and came second last year . 
  very populist . 
  they can be centre-right , centre or centre-left depending on the mood . 
  they will say anything to get elected . 
  they had a very broad range of voters due to this . 
  there is n't any real big difference between fg and ff . 
  most people vote for one over the other because that 's the side their family supported during the civil war . 
  but what is really stupid about this is that nobody cares about the issue it was about , the anglo-irish treaty . 
  there is n't any debate about it . 
  this means that they are merely voting for them because `` that 's who my father supported . '', 
  ** bold ** labour ** bold ** used to be the third largest party , but is now the fourth and was mainly supported by the working class . 
  it 's working class support is pretty much gone . 
  it 's now mainly supported by the liberal middle class . 
  it claims to be centre-left but is really in the centre . 
  ** bold ** greens ** bold ** were in coalition with fianna f\u00e1il . 
  before the recession so lost all 6 of their seats in 2011 , but got 2 last year . 
  the same demographic as labour would support them . 
  ** bold ** social democrats ** bold ** not really a party . 
  it was formed by 3 independents , one of whom left to join fianna f\u00e1il . 
  it 's two tds are very respected and are seen as very trustworthy and competent . 
  the one who left was even more so , but he has lost a lot of his supporters for joining the party of corruption , which he had often criticised . 
  it 's a centre-left party aspiring to the nordic model and is very anti-corruption . 
  ** bold ** sinn f\u00e9in ( we ourselves ) ** bold ** currently the main nationalist party in northern ireland and the third largest party in the republic . 
  it 's now the main party of the working class . 
  it also has strong support among young people . 
  it 's very supportive of irish unity and nationalism and mentions in nearly every second sentence . 
  but this nationalism is very different to the far-right . 
  they are for instance criticising the lack of response to the refugee crisis and are calling for better conditions . 
  it 's economic policies are often called ridiculous but are often commonplace in the rest of europe . 
  there 's a very bad image problem due to it being associated with the ira , but with the current leader due to step aside in a while and replaced by somebody with no connections this may change .
