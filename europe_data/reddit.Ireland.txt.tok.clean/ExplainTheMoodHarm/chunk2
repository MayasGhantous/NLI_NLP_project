  shit situation all round . 
  while i would n't go that far , it is a huge issue ; hence why the irish government has been working to maintain cta . 
  the problem is that the viability of the cta will depend on the type of deal that the uk gets from the eu . 
  how is it in their interests to do it any sooner . 
  nominations open today and close tomorrow . 
  if there are more than two candidates , tory mps will vote to determine the two that will go forward to the party membership . 
  hustings to follow and then membership vote with new leader in place by 9 september . 
  whole thing to be organised by the tory 1922 committee . 
  it 's an inference , and probably a weak one , from the statements made by simon fraser , the former permanent secretary at the foreign office in the article above . 
  they may have been semi-european for a long time , but it 's a huge loss , i think , for both the eu and the uk . 
  sad day . 
  that wo n't happen in the foreseeable future . 
  but it 'll be hard to maintain the cta without border controls elsewhere . 
  they 're definitely going to try that angle but i ca n't see much traction on the freedom of movement for eu citizens . 
  civil service really do n't want brexit to happen . 
  whoever comes in they 're going to advocate deferring notification as long as possible and seeing if the ground has changed after other upcoming european elections . 
  and they really seem to believe that their might be an opening within the eu on the free movement of people . 
  exactly . 
  and if the hard border is n't between ni and roi will it be between the island of ireland and britain ? 
  yes , particularly this :  finally , keep immigration at high levels . 
  many people who voted for brexit wanted it to come down , but that is a debate for another day . 
  both governments will want the common travel area to continue , whether that will be possible remains to be seen . 
  after brexit , the border between ni and roi will be an external border of the eu . 
  all other eu borders come with border controls . 
  with brexit , roi could come under pressure to enter the schengen agreement ( the only reason we did n't before was the uk opt out ) ; if that comes to pass then there almost certainly be stringent passport controls . 
  the situation would be even more fucked up if , for any reason , the uk was not fully in the eea under a norway type agreement as then ` brussels would have to determine the arrangements by which uk nationals , capital , goods and services gain access to ireland to enable the internal market to function ' . 
  [ report ] ( https://www.academia.edu/26337674/policy_paper_brexit_ireland_and_northern_ireland?auto=download ), 
   moody 's expects that the high degree of uncertainty over the uk 's future trade relationship with the eu will lead to lower gdp growth over the next two years , in response to diminished confidence and lower spending and investment . 
  moody 's expects real gdp growth to be roughly 0.5 % lower in 2016 and roughly 1 % lower in 2017 than the agency 's previous forecasts of 1.8 % and 2.1 % , respectively , as noted in ` moody 's changes outlook on uk sovereign rating to negative from stable , affirms aa1 rating ' . 
   during this period , moody 's expects reduced credit demand to result in lower business volumes for uk banks . 
  the agency expects a modest increase in unemployment and lower asset prices to lead to higher credit losses . 
  moody 's also expects that the uk will need to renegotiate new `` passporting '' agreements with its eu partners , which could lead to additional costs for banks if the final agreements fail to replicate current conditions . 
  september now i think . 
  the only way they 're `` coming back '' is if they do n't leave ( i.e. 
  do n't notify under article 50 ) in which case they 'll keep their exceptions . 
  highly unlikely and while i 'd really like them to stay it 's hard to see that working for anyone . 
  perhaps if things deteriorate sufficiently in the next few months ... 
  perhaps , but whatever happens is reliant upon the internal dynamics of the tory party who 've already ruled out the possibility of a second referendum . 
  i guess , defer notification and hope there 's a change in political context . 
  even then , something would have been permanently broken . 
  dalia grybauskait\u00e9 , never heard her talk before and i know nothing about her ; but i like her in this segment . 
  q : what are you going to say to prime minister cameron today ? 
  dg : i think he needs to say something to us , not us to him . 
  q : will there ever by a brexit ? 
  dg : i think psychologically , mentally , brexit is already in place , because of [ the ] vote and because it was proposed in the first place , because of ambitions of a few politicians and [ their ] country became a hostage of these ambitions . 
  q : what happens if article 50 has never been triggered . 
  dg : welcome , welcome back ... 
   ... they are relishing the schadenfreude . 
  much like the irish ... brexit is a major crisis for ireland . 
  we 're willing to work with our european partners on this outcome . 
  sure . 
  but before notification , from the uk 's perspective , it would be better to have a deal in place with the eu . 
  after notification , the uk do n't have a decent bargaining position . 
  no negotiations before notification indicates a degree of eu hardball . 
  that position may soften over the next several months , or not . 
  yeah . 
  most of these wo n't come to pass in any case . 
  but there is an issue and europe has several problems on the horizon . 
  according to the [ report ] ( http://www.ecfr.eu/page/-/ecfr_181_-_the_world_according_to_europe%2527s_insurgent_parties.pdf ) , the 34 putative referenda advocated by various european `` insurgent '' political parties are on issues such as eu membership , eurozone membership , and refugee relocation quotas . 
  actual referenda issues and `` insurgent '' parties seeking referenda on these issues :  ** their country 's eu membership ** : austria 's fp\u00d6 , france 's front national and communist party ; czech republic 's kscm , party of free citizens , and dawn -- national coalition ; sweden democrats ; danish people 's party ; belgium 's vlaams belang ; bulgaria 's ataka ; germany 's afd ; hungary 's jobbik ; italy 's lega nord ; conservative people 's party of estonia ; the netherlands ' pvv  ** ukraine association agreement/other association agreements : ** belgium 's vlaams belang ; germany 's afd turkey 's eu membership : bulgaria 's ataka and patriotic front  ** nato membership : ** bulgaria 's ataka legitimacy and content of refugee policy : conservative people 's party of estonia ; germany 's afd ; belgium 's vlaams belang  ** `` abuse of free movement '' : ** sweden democrats refugee relocation quotas : estonia 's party of people 's unity ; hungary 's fidesz ; and jobbik ; poland 's kukiz \u201915  ** their country 's eurozone membership : ** germany 's afd ; italy 's five star  ** movement eurozone responsibility towards greece/compliance with stability and growth pact : ** estonian party of people 's unity ; portugual 's left bloc  ** enlargement issues : ** germany 's afd ; austria 's fp\u00d6  ** future changes in eu treaties/further transfer of sovereign powers : ** portugal 's left bloc ; sweden democrats ; estonian party of people 's unity ; austria 's fp\u00d6 ttip : slovenia 's united left and slovenian people 's party  ** national issues , such as independence of regions , repercussions for elected officials : ** spain 's podemos ; romania 's democratic nationalist party ; croatia 's human shield party and most, 
  juncker has just reiterated that there wo n't be negotiations with uk until there is official notification . 
  dunno if he believes it . 
  i guess so . 
  full quote :  why do n't we be grown up , pragmatic , sensible , realistic and let 's cut between us a sensible tariff-free deal and thereafter recognise that the united kingdom will be your friend , that we will trade with you , cooperate with you , we will be your best friends in the world . 
  do that , do it sensibly , and allow us to go off and pursue our global ambitions and future . 
  good points . 
  on another [ thread  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4q8osp/tubthumping_speech_from_alyn_smith_mep_snp_gets/d4r1jcc )  farage is attempting to ruin any chance of a cooperative eu when it comes to negotiations with the next uk government . 
   he was on channel4 news last night saying that he feels betrayed by the leave campaign , i suspect todays performance from him is an attempt at payback . 
   nobody expected farage to be particularly pleasant today but that went beyond his usual level of belligerence . 
  in which case it 's deliberate sabotage ; also aimed at domestic audience i suppose . 
  wonderful diplomatic work by nigel at eu parliament - the body that will be voting on withdrawal terms for the uk . 
  it 's not a moral issue or a reason to denigrate the young ; it is , rather , a signal of deeper problems . 
  it 's driven by lack of political knowledge particularly regarding the eu ( which is complex ) , lack of affiliation with traditional political parties , and lack of faith in political institutions . 
  whether scotland could remain within the eu rather than applying for membership as a new state will be a political determination as there is no existing eu law governing this situation . 
  if the eu wants them in , it will happen . 
  cameron called the referendum , other than resigning , he should have had some contingency in place to manage a leave vote . 
  while i empathise with his distaste ` for doing all the hard shit ' and it might be emotionally satisfying to have the shallow careerist vacuity of the leave campaign leaders revealed , there 's too much at stake for this kind of childish abnegation of responsibilty . 
  whitehall has been directed only today to establish a unit to deal with brexit ; given the nature of the task , this should have been set up once the referendum had been called . 
  whitehall should be briefing the opposition and all potential government leadership ( boris , may , etc ) on the economic , foreign policy and strategic decisions they are facing . 
  it 's just reality . 
  a uk that prospers outside of the eu is a bad advertisement for the eu and will act as an incentive for those social fractions in various countries across the eu who want to leave . 
  the eu will be badly damaged economically by the loss of the uk and , while they may not want to be seen to be vindictive about it , i 'd be surprised if no price was exacted . 
  while germany may press for a purely economic perspective on brexit , others will wish to see some kind of penalty . 
  whatever the economic imperatives , it is not in the eu 's strategic interest that the uk would be seen to prosper having left the eu . 
  right . 
  the eu is insignificant to the us . 
  anyway you 're mistaken to focus just on trade : [ ` mutual investment dwarfs trade and is the real backbone of the transatlantic economy ' ] ( http://www.transatlanticbusiness.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/160301-tae-full-book.pdf ) . 
  in 2014 , us affiliate sales in europe were $ 2.9 trillion ; ` greater than total u.s. exports to the world of $ 2.3 trillion and 46 % of total u.s. foreign affiliate sales globally ' . 
  eu affiliate sales in the us were $ 2.4 trillion in 2013 , triple european exports to the us . 
  ' 60 % of total u.s. fdi outflows globally went to europe in 2015 . 
  only 16.1 % went to the asia-pacific region ' . 
  ` europe remains the most profitable region of the world for u.s. companies . 
  u.s. foreign affiliate income earned in europe in 2015 was an estimated $ 240 billion -- a record high , flat from 2014 but one-third higher than the depressed levels of 2009 . ', 
  ` in 2015 europe accounted for 80 % of estimated global fdi inflows into the u.s. of $ 384 billion . ', 
  the uk is a huge part of all that , of course , and its loss to the eu is very significant . 
  yes . 
  canada was the us 's largest trade partner last year . 
  prior to that it was the eu, 
  germany is the natural candidate, 
  automatic reduction of us influence in eu ; no doubt the us will need another special partner in the eu,
