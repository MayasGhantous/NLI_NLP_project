   i do n't need to remind you that insane clean up that erdogan made for turkey after the failed coup attempt . 
  that was by most accounts a staged coup to allow him to do whatever he wanted though . 
   putin does have support from forces , governors ( appointed by him personally ) and people though . 
  oh yeah , i 'm not saying the support does n't exist , it definitely does . 
   your ancestors snapped a bit of my country off . 
  you might need to explain that one . 
  victoria and parliament were massively against home rule . 
  short of leaping in front of vic to save her from a bullet nothing parnell personally did would effect that outcome . 
  better than whatever this is . 
  as long as oil keeps low it 's only a matter of time . 
  the sanctions are really just the icing on top of that . 
   well then eu should n't pretend that sanctions are anything but punishment . 
  we 're not . 
  they 're absolutely a punishment . 
  we 're very clear about this . 
  you did something wrong and you are getting punished for it . 
   russians do support putin , govt is a different story . 
  which is even worse , to be fair . 
  it 's like saying you trust the godfather but not the mob . 
  i 'm happy with the sanctions , but i would also be happy to see boots on the ground at ukraine 's invitation to help them regain control of the donbas . 
   except ireland would have got a united 32 counties home rule around 1890 * smiles and nods *, 
   i could just as easily say that your country is directly responsible for arbitrarily partitioning mine . 
  let 's hear your rational , / u/hawkuk . 
   hahah that guy just made you look like such a dick . . 
  although you did a pretty good job of doing that yourself i 'm sure i 'll somehow manage to weather it . 
  the ulster unionists were backed by the british government . 
  ancestry does n't change history and nobody 's blaming the `` modern english . '', 
  holding the government to account for it 's actions however is entirely warranted ; each government inherits the old , nobody starts with a clean slate or wiped debts or credits . 
  modern brits no , british government yes , and should be very obvious when i say `` you run it '' that i 'm not talking to / u/chrisporter and his cabinet . 
  and it was called *** grandgooooooore *** *** grandgooooooore *** infecting the peasants , infecting the country , infecting the people and the *** thatched roof cottages ***, 
  boom , five points for this man . 
  no , you ca n't . 
  corollary : you can justify genocide with * anything * if you want to . 
   i can see absolutely nothing happening . 
  that 's `` backfiring spectacularly '' to you ? 
  good on you girls . 
  somebody else sharing a childish sentiment does not make it less childish . 
  i 'd did n't say you were an arsehole . 
  but your country is directly responsible for arbitrarily partitioning mine , * and you run it * so yes , investment is owed . 
  i 'll look into your sources when i get back from the office . 
  i 'll take a source on that . 
  that 's very interesting . 
  [ the st andrew 's agreement . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st_andrews_agreement ), 
  er , no they 've already agreed to the terms of separation in the gfa and sag . 
  you 've got to be pretty childish to think that somebody who does n't agree with your politics hates the uk . 
  ... wait did you used to be a mod here or did i imagine that ? 
  the flag of the republic is already a giant plea for peace between the orange and green , but yeah that harp is rad and i 'd love to see it on a flag . 
  most importantly , your football team got better . 
  we should yeah , but that 's what decades of sectarianism and poor governance ( from westminster and stormont both ) get you . 
  yeah , i 'm a nationalist from southern ni and even i think some people are getting carried away . 
  it is . 
  the problem is the gfa and sag contain significant references to the european union , and practically speaking ni has seen a significant improvement in quality of life with eu investment that britain never gave us . 
  it 's one of those rare situations that saw unionists cross the divide to vote with nationalists , hence norn iron voting to remain despite the dup , it 's largest party , campaigning for leave and the dup subsequently losing a rake of seats in last week 's elections . 
  before anyone asks , yes he 's a hardline unionist . 
  yeah i 'm sure canada , with toronto being the biggest ukrainian city on earth outside europe , really cares . 
  as far as i 'm concerned shut the door . 
  people have decided what they want and there 's a firm logic behind it . 
  there 's not many people crying for us to let * more * people in . 
  / u/kinggeorgecommands is a dup voter . 
  that 's really all you need to know as far as irrationality and oppression goes . 
   the fact that it took the working class and middling sorts to back brexit the working class and middle class supported remain . 
  [ these folks supported brexit . 
  ] ( http://irishpost.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/brexit-1-1.jpg ), 
   i 'm beginning to feel your point is more about the exceptionality of london and less about the effects of brexit . 
  this is the argument of everyone outside of london regardless of their opinion on brexit , to be fair . 
  yes but they do n't * know * that . 
  i would argue the reason * why * is because of the absolute non-accountability of the british right-wing media , but that 's just my argument . 
   de-industrialization and globalization is their fault ? 
  both of these are inevitabilities . 
  you might as well complain about the decline of the stage-coach and non-paper currency . 
   it 's their fault for wanting to preserve the traditional british way of life yes whereas half of britain literally wants to burn down st paul 's cathedral and drown the queen in a pool of corgi piss and commemorative princess diana crockery . 
  please do n't try and make `` our culture and heritage '' an argument . 
  it 's ridiculously dishonest . 
   and preserve their ethnic and cultural identity ? 
  this is getting very gross . 
  britain has been a multicultural society since the victorian age ( shock-horror , also their historical highpoint ) , arguably earlier . 
  populism is reason-free , that 's the definition of what it is . 
  you do n't get to demand respect for acting like a crying child just because a lot of * other * kids did it too . 
  populists are free to sit in their holes in / r/the _ donald and dig deeper while complaining about how dark it 's getting down there . 
  yeah i have very little sympathy for fools complaining that everyone was telling them they were being lied to and that they did n't know what they were talking about *** finding out that they were lied to and that they did n't know what they were talking about . 
   brexit was one of the rarest chances they felt they had to roll back on this , simple question : how ? 
  well they 've been hung out to dry by uncaring rural englanders so that 's not the most unreasonable proposal in the world , but i still ca n't see them going for it . 
  which , again , you guys invaded . 
  good news . 
  precision german fashion . 
  does it ? 
  i mean great if it 's actually happening , it 's just there 's been no word on this , right ? 
  you know what really grinds my gears ? 
  peaceful , law-abiding citizens who pay their taxes and do n't proselytize in the street like crazy people . 
  stop talking to the troll , thanks . 
  i 'm sure they 'll somehow manage to weather the scorn . 
  there 's a couple hundred there anyway . 
  i mean my god man . 
  the joke is that he 's a dictator and is killing his own people . 
  you 've been told what the movement is for , now all you 're doing is establishing that you do n't like it . 
  we get it . 
  i eagerly await your ensuing comment telling me you do n't really care one way or the other . 
  sure if you do n't count all the people . 
  coolio .
