  you 're an emotional child who does n't know what the term `` little englander '' means and is eager to smear someone else when you get into a little huff . 
  grow up kid . 
  blocked . 
  and scotland and northern ireland would both be remaining . 
  and london , and every major urban centre in the land . 
  oh is the poor little englander feeling oppressed ? 
  do n't embarrass yourself . 
  you do n't know the meaning of the word . 
  * raises eco-friendly fair trade coffee in salute *, 
  it is ? 
  england is 15 times the size of wales . 
  what nonsense is this ? 
  that 's an abject lie , though . 
  most * brexiters * ca n't even agree on what they want , never mind the * half * of the country united in opposing them . 
  i 'd ask why you feel the need to propagate lies , but y' know . 
  it 's obvious . 
  speak the 1 % ers name and he shall appear . 
  * takes off kissinger glasses * *** it beginning now is . 
  good for them . 
  dude sounds like a riot . 
  i mean , he looks like he 's * had * a few hips in his time . 
   one criminal gets a sentence and the others do n't vs no criminals get the sentence . 
  which is better ? 
   however , having said that , the way serdyukov or luzhkov got free pass for what they 've done is just despicable , absolutely no arguing with that . 
  you ... you literally just argued for that . 
  water still wet , then ? 
  we 're part of the eu , that 's where half of all your exports go . 
  we 're also incredibly aware ( speaking as a norn ironer here ) that english people foisted this upon us , not the eu . 
  you voted for this . 
  if you enforce a hard border as well , the deaths will be on your heads , not brussels . 
  this list is essentially meaningless given it 's * incredibly * vague wording , but these passages stand out :  strengthening the union -- we will secure a deal that works for the entire uk -- for scotland , wales , northern ireland and all parts of england . 
  we remain fully committed to the belfast agreement and its successors . 
   4 . protecting our strong and historic ties with ireland and maintaining the common travel area -- we will work to deliver a practical solution that allows for the maintenance of the common travel area , whilst protecting the integrity of our immigration system and which protects our strong ties with ireland . 
  the belfast agreement specifically mentions the european union and the removal of border control , so i sincerely doubt this . 
  had england cared about these ties , they would n't have voted for brexit . 
  i 'm tired of quietly putting up with this kind of attitude so if you do n't want to listen to a rant , skip to the end . 
  i am so tired of the delusion typed one-handed by brexiteers and trump supporters that they were the righteous warriors of a noble cause . 
  that this was somehow always coming because the vile left had ignored and mocked them for their lack of fact-based politics . 
  so let 's be dismiss this right now : this was not a movement . 
  the only relation between trump 's victory over clinton ( which was because it was * clinton * , the most loathesome candidate the dnp has run in decades ) and brexit 's victory over remain were an embrace of `` alternative fact '' politics and support from people with ulterior motives . 
  nevermind that the election was lost by the dnc rather than won by trump ( to say nothing of him *** actually , physically getting less votes than her *** ) let 's focus on the ridiculous theatre that brexit was a united movement . 
  your people ca n't even agree on what they voted for . 
  some brexiters want to stay in the single market . 
  some want to cut a deal . 
  some want to leave it altogether . 
  some argued for the switzerland option . 
  some for the canada option . 
  some for the norway option . 
  people have been murdered in the name of brexit . 
  people 's property have been burned in the name of brexit . 
  is this to be laid at your collective doors ? 
  of course not . 
  because the truth is this was n't some unified movement . 
  this was n't some grand uprising . 
  this was the unsexy and very complicated culimination of * decades of political scapegoating the eu for every problem under the sun up to and including [ the shape of bananas ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/11/boris-johnson-launches-the-vote-leave-battlebus-in-cornwall ) * right-wing media moguls rupert murdoch and lord rothermere owning * half * of british news media * the british press being allowed to lie to the public without being held to account and without punishment * generations of monied , eton-to-oxbridge career-politicians being elected into office assuming a life of privilege with little regard for the responsibilities of their office or the national interest * a global economy still recovering from the american-created 2008 banking disaster * putin [ literally following the plan of aleksander dugin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics ) in destabilizing a world he ca n't deal with into something that he can * which means [ brexit parties get linked to kremlin funding , ] ( https://www.google.ca/?gws_rd=ssl#safe=strict&amp;q=bnp+kremlin+funding ) the [ front national get kremlin funding ] ( https://www.google.ca/?gws_rd=ssl#safe=strict&amp;q=front+national+kremlin+funding ) that [ trump advisor ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/23/trump-advisor-under-investigation-for-russia-ties-report/ ) after [ trump advisor has kremlin ties ] ( http://www.salon.com/2016/10/07/another-donald-trump-adviser-with-kremlin-connections-gop-lobbyist-for-russian-pipeline-crafted-trumps-major-foreign-policy-speech/ ) * and that of course the man himself can continue his contra-style insurgency into a previously peaceful ukraine . 
  make no mistake , this is not a movement , this is not a motion . 
  this is a political scene and a bunch of gullible voters . 
  and the idea - the sheer *** suggestion *** - that what we should be learning from you is that you were * right * ? 
  is fucked . 
  is absolutely fucked . 
  should the left learn from this ? 
  absolutely . 
  the dnp is seeing a wave of reform through anti-corporate pro-fact movements such as the [ justice democrats . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/justice_democrats ) eu member states are moving towards closer unity and trump and brexit 's kremlin bedfellow la pen is facing growing scorn , charges of fraud and her populist supporter base not turning up . 
  brexit and trump are showing the problems with blindly following populists in alienating both rivals and trading allies as well as your own citizens when trying to boss them around . 
  and the british [ `` euromyth '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euromyth ) has become at home and abroad a bit of a cultural embarrassment . 
  the idea that ignorance and lies should be * rewarded * with engagement and entertainment on the same level as evidence-based research and expert advice is something not even * primary school children * would entertain . 
  and i for one am sick and fucking tired of everyone being so polite about it . 
  when i see a spade i call it a spade , whether it 's covered in bullshit or not . 
  and these two political movements have been absolutely dripping in it . 
  sorry for anyone who managed to read through that , i just needed a good rant . 
  russian backed funds and right-wing media magnates telling you how to think in the face of provided evidence ? 
  yeah , they fooled you . 
  why , what did you think you did ? 
  i mean , the obvious thing to do is to remove putin . 
  give him some lincoln thinkin ' . 
  it 'd be nice if we endorse this too , though i ca n't imagine kenny is the kind to care about combatting corruption or graft . 
  holy fuck . 
  decent lads . 
  no kidding . 
  while i agree with the quote , russia 's life-expectancy is the same as that of putin 's . 
  he 's explicitly set it up so he 's utterly indispensable and the state just ca n't function without him . 
  fist o ' pump, 
  yeah i mean a rising tide lifts all ships , right ? 
  i feel like dishonest people are just taking shots at germany because the war . 
  saving this for when i get outta the office , cheers !, 
  this guy gets it . 
  hooray !, 
  a good thing !, 
  please continuing treating yourself as lone crusaders against a terrible evil . 
  long story short half the country 's furious . 
  sounds good . 
  with the uk out major opposition - henceforth referred to as bitching - to apparently every attempt at this is removed . 
  here you go , from the eu citizens with love < 3, 
  i 'll throw this one in here too : [ the harp the coat of arms and guinness logo are based upon . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/trinity_college_harp ), 
  it 's all based on the same harp actually . 
  [ it 's called alternatively the trinity harp or the harp of brian boru . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/trinity_college_harp ), 
  what .
