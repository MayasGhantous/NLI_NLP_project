  a. slimeball . 
   afghanistan was a nato endeavour and nato is * primarily * a us power-projection tool . 
  it 's staffed and general 's mostly by americans and [ saceur has only ever been an american general . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supreme_headquarters_allied_powers_europe#supreme_allied_commander_europe_.28saceur.29 )  the u.k. chose to go to iraq . 
  nobody dragged it into it . 
  it did so of its own free volition . 
  hahahaha, 
   it is `` thanks '' when you see how people are saying the eu should punish , cut ties with & re-align from america because of a trump presidency the reality tv show host who you lads elected to office has been openly hostile to the organization that we overwhelmingly support and is of massive benefit to us . 
  people he appointed to office are openly talking about the disintegration of the eu and how they can bring it about . 
  fuck his goddamn arrogance if he thinks he can act that way and get nothing for it . 
   or how it should move to fan the flames of scottish seccession in retaliation for brexit . 
  nobody is saying this . 
  scotland is doing that job itself . 
  what europeans are reacting to are the brexiteers and british government , who are making an absolute shambles of this process and loudly attacking the eu in very childish ways respectively . 
   imagine if america did that to ireland instead of flooding you with corporate investment , that 's private enterprise , not american policy . 
  thanks for the skeleton offices in dublin so you can take advantage of our low corporation tax and leave as soon as it jumps , i guess ? 
   being neutral over northern ireland & pretty much always providing you with friendly diplomatic support . 
  you realize this is because you have a massive irish population who would n't let you do anything else , right ? 
   to be fair , we did n't abandon & try to undermine germany under schroeder when it tried to trade us in for putin & refused to back us in iraq . 
  no that 's just a recent thing . 
   nor did we try to undermine & hurt ireland when it refused to join nato . 
  i mean , thanks ? 
  oh well there you go then . 
  just without the empire bit , i guess . 
  then i refer you to the tried-and-trusted truism of * `` opinions are like assholes '' * . 
  the special relationship that dragged the uk into iraq and afghanistan for ... no gain ? 
   since when was the eu co-organising globalisation ? 
  they ca n't even organise their own currency . 
  not really sure the uk gets to have an opinion on either of these . 
  to be fair so do brexit and president donald trump . 
  i mean this is literally the truth though . 
   you 're probably slightly butthurt as you fit the decription of the person the article is satirizing ( could be wrong on this , but i 'm probably quite close to the mark ) . 
  you mean pro-brexit news is posted by brexiters and anti-brexit news posted by non-brexiters . 
  they have a well-established history of spying on themselves . 
  the snooper 's charter only just happened , remember . 
  weeb decries globalism while quoting japanese anime . 
  op got done a murder by an osloite . 
  almost exactly what you would think it is ; it 's moonshine , [ just mixed with coffee . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karsk ) that might seem self-defeating to some , but you see, 
  yessss , do eeeeeeet, 
  wow , the united states is becoming one bad fucking neighbour . 
  miss allemagne with the saucy smile . 
   so we must rebuild europe 's institutional and democratic foundations and ensure that any new eu-wide powers are understood and accepted by its citizens . 
  at the same time we must defend and strengthen a union that allows european countries to speak with a louder voice on the world stage . 
  mr trump 's recent critical remarks about the eu highlight how important this is . 
  lotta nail on the head action going on here . 
  it 's the fallout from unrestricted right-wing media running amok and weak politicians facilitating a culture of political scapegoating . 
  and thus we celebrate with the 155th *** romamania !!!, 
  only if you 're unreasonable . 
  when he walks like a clown , talks like a clown and acts like a clown you call him a clown . 
  just because the clown is now in elected office does n't change his clownishness . 
  name checks out . 
  people who treat the office of head of state as a burden of responsibility versus people who revel in the power it provides them . 
  obama and merkel seem at odds with trump on this . 
   state aid everytime this gets raised someone pops up to state that it 's not practical . 
  i 'd find the quote i 'm thinking of but i 'm in the office atm . 
   german vice chancellor sigmar gabriel said after friday 's inaugaration that germany might need a new economic strategy geared towards asia if the us government imposes protectionist policies . 
  thank god everyone 's identifying the problem and the obvious solution right away . 
  it 's better dealing with the market that has n't stated it 's vested interest in disintegrating us . 
  because y' know , apparently that 's a thing allies do to each other these days . 
   / u/finndacool does not really have balanced opinions . 
  he calls brexit `` english ultranationalism '' . 
  [ that almost sounds like you 're disagreeing with me . 
  ] ( https://www.google.ca/search?safe=strict&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=951&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;btng=search&amp;q=english+celebrate+brexit#safe=strict&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=brexit+celebrations ), 
  well , no . 
  most people 's views of brexiters are [ like this , ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/bb74/production/_90088974_mediaitem90088973.jpg ) considering this is what the campaign chose to beam to the universe while doing it 's victory lap . 
  privileged aristocratic toffs eagerly waving miniature flags as they ladel a thick-helping of profits onto themselves at the expense of everyone else . 
  the idea that brexit was the working man 's revolt is something peddled by breitbart and the sun . 
  you chaps are the ones - the only ones - making out like bandits after this . 
  same old story , brand new day . 
  take it up with the arch-leaver over there and his fancy 1 % job . 
   we were n't aware that we were trying to create an alliance with switzerland against the eu . 
  to be fair , you 're not aware of what your government is doing anyway . 
   we just want to leave the eu . 
  to be fair , half of you do . 
  sort of . 
   the reality of leaving the eu is that we will focus far more on old friends and new allies than we would have were we going to stay , but that is n't really an alliance against the eu . 
  to be fair , this does n't mean anything . 
  apart from the people behind it of course . 
  trim , right ? 
  lovely area . 
  ah , the north antrim coast , what a beautiful stretch of country . 
  i think that might already be taken . 
  the pretty borders faction is concerned by this news . 
  ... russian volunteers ? 
  european volunteers ? 
  as someone who grew up on the border - yup . 
  okay this is cool . 
  sweet . 
  i do n't think anyone would object to that . 
  exactly . 
  the british debacle has served as a major warning to disingenuous governments using the eu as a scapegoat while feigning innoncence . 
  the age when that tactic works passed with brexit . 
  positions are relative . 
   the problem is we ca n't agree who the `` enemy '' actually is and we certainly ca n't agree on measures to be taken . 
  i think we can all agree on that , actually . 
  both russia and the us have declared themselves as hostile to us . 
  it 's pretty straight from here . 
  it 's entirely inconsequential for the eu . 
   i agree , the british voter , unaware of the reality of trade , has forced the government into a direction that is bound to hurt the country .
