  investing in africa and effectively utilizing africa as a demonstration of your soft power are 2 * very * different things . 
  just this week a massive bridge collapses that was built by chinese labour . 
  the view of china is probably not as rosy as china would like to believe . 
  my friend gave me the witcher 3 : the wild hunt with both expansion packs for by xbone the other . 
  i 'm just out of the `` training '' area and i can already feel this thing starting to take my life over . 
  damn you poland !, 
  that sounds ... a bit dodgy ? 
   it is grains that could support the population . 
  meat and butter were never going to sustain the population i am watching a man double-back and tie himself into knots . 
  sure look at you on your wee alt account , god bless, 
  [ ** ireland was absolutely a net exporter of food during the famine ** ] ( http://www.jrbooksonline.com/pdf_books/irish.pdf ) ) and your article does n't dispute that ; what it was n't a net exporter of was * wheat and grains . 
  * which is , again , all your article discusses , and it mostly discusses it from the period of time from the famine to the first world war , not of the famine itself . 
  [ to be more specific  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_famine_ ( ireland ) #irish _ food_exports_during_famine )  records show that irish lands exported food even during the worst years of the famine . 
  when ireland had experienced a famine in 1782 -- 83 , ports were closed to keep irish-grown food in ireland to feed the irish . 
  local food prices promptly dropped . 
  merchants lobbied against the export ban , but government in the 1780s overrode their protests . 
  [ 79 ] no such export ban happened in the 1840s . 
  [ 80 ]  throughout the entire period of the famine , ireland was exporting enormous quantities of food . 
  in the magazine history ireland ( 1997 , issue 5 , pp . 
  32 -- 36 ) , christine kinealy , a great hunger scholar , lecturer , and drew university professor , relates her findings : almost 4,000 vessels carried food from ireland to the ports of bristol , glasgow , liverpool , and london during 1847 , when 400,000 irish men , women , and children died of starvation and related diseases . 
  she also writes that irish exports of calves , livestock ( except pigs ) , bacon , and ham actually increased during the famine . 
  this food was shipped under british military guard from the most famine-stricken parts of ireland ; ballina , ballyshannon , bantry , dingle , killala , kilrush , limerick , sligo , tralee , and westport . 
  a wide variety of commodities left ireland during 1847 , including peas , beans , onions , rabbits , salmon , oysters , herring , lard , honey , tongues , animal skins , rags , shoes , soap , glue , and seed . 
  the most shocking export figures concern butter . 
  butter was shipped in firkins , each one holding 9 imperial gallons ; 41 litres . 
  in the first nine months of 1847 , 56,557 firkins ( 509,010 imperial gallons ; 2,314,000 litres ) were exported from ireland to bristol , and 34,852 firkins ( 313,670 imperial gallons ; 1,426,000 litres ) were shipped to liverpool , which correlates with 822,681 imperial gallons ( 3,739,980 litres ) of butter exported to england from ireland during nine months of the worst year of the famine . 
  [ 81 ] the problem in ireland was not lack of food , which was plentiful , but the price of it , which was beyond the reach of the poor . 
  [ 82 ]  the historian cecil woodham-smith wrote in the great hunger : ireland 1845 -- 1849 that no issue has provoked so much anger and embittered relations between england and ireland `` as the indisputable fact that huge quantities of food were exported from ireland to england throughout the period when the people of ireland were dying of starvation . 
  '' [ 83 ] john ranelagh writes that ireland remained a net exporter of food throughout most of the five-year famine . 
  [ 84 ] however , both woodham-smith and cormac \u00d3 gr\u00e1da write that , in addition to the maize imports , four times as much wheat was imported into ireland at the height of the famine as exported . 
   that is a bit of local mythology that first appears in a print with no sources about 15 years after the famine and has not been substantiated by any historical source in the years since . 
  that 's specific enough where presumably you have a source on it ? 
  possessive . 
  not * that * commonwealth . 
  if i were to guess i 'd say it was affirmation of international disapproval . 
  that 's beautiful !, 
  again mate , see above . 
  sorry i 'll be honest , i 'm not reading anything you post . 
  this is a case where you 're bending over backwards to have an arguement with yourself while having a terrible arguement . 
  to be clear , you presenting a situation as sound does not make it so , and the manner in which you are doing shows the reasoning , again , of a psychopath . 
  so i 'm out . 
  you 're overly invested in a flimsy thought-experiment when reality exists that overturns the narrative . 
  continue if you like . 
  you 're dismissing culpability because of non-existing hypotheticals . 
  in the legal sector we 'd call that `` not a defence . '', 
  englishman back-pedals from bigoted overtones after balls shrink , news once i climb off the queen . 
  rolled an account just for that eh ? 
  you 're literally dismissing reality for hypotheticals . 
  please stop . 
  ... yes ? 
  i do , it 's to the west of them ;-), 
  exactly . 
  examining hypotheticals is useless and nobody but you is interested in doing that . 
  we can examine * actusl things that happened * in addition to the famine . 
  your country committed the genocide . 
  france did not to its people , germany ( well , the hre ) did not to its people . 
  spain did not to its people . 
   you 're not engaging with the argument . 
   if the irish would have done it , okay you 're not listening and you 're continuing the psychopath arguement . 
   now , if you want to take the `` awful imperialist british '' line , you have to engage with what you believe the irish would have done as has been pointed out to you already , all you have to do is look at the famines in other parts of europe throughout the period and the responses they received compared to the devastation wrought in ireland due to english misrule . 
  you may not like it , but there 's no `` taking a line '' here - `` awful imperialist britain '' is 100 % responsible for this famine ( and others , such as the one coming to british india a century later ) . 
  you need to square yourself with that . 
  i feel you but  so you feel that irish really were in some way culturally superior * this is the shit i 'm talking about . 
  * nobody is talking about `` cultural superiority . '', 
  we have what * happened , * and what * did n't happen . 
  * that is * all we have here . 
  * britain starved 4 million out of ireland , either into the coffin-ships or the coffins . 
  france did n't do that to the occitans . 
  the prussians did n't do it to the bavarians . 
  the castillians did n't do it to the catalans . 
  britain did it to ireland . 
  that happened , it was horrible , you need to be square with it because it is probably * the * fundamental event in irish history . 
  everything in ireland from the last 150 years flows directly from the great hunger . 
  your government has already apologized about it and your history books recognize it . 
  just , y' know , sort yourself out . 
  pedantically sure , but so is `` the sky is green '' or `` i poop rainbows . '', 
   same country , same government , same queen , same laws , same nationality . 
  you ca n't escape your britishness , best just accept it . 
  honestly curious , where do you think i live ? 
  oh but as you were nice enough to share a song for me , [ this one 's much more my taste . 
   ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_-kobibg0 ), 
  do people seriously say `` you 're a fascist '' to you often enough that you think it 's a meme ? 
   all i 'm saying is ireland is n't any more moral for not committing genocide , okay , stop , take a deep breath , look at this line . 
  understand this ; there were famines in britain and ireland and europe before - the issue is that * none * of them had britain 's level of malevolent disinterest in them that the great famine did . 
  this was * absolutely * unique ( until you jump forward a hundred years to the british famines in india or the holodomor ) . 
  this was a uniquely and absolutely evil thing that if you are * trying * to defend you should n't defend with * it 's fine because everyone else is evil anyways . 
  * because that makes you look like a fucking psychopath . 
   and your debunking of my argument i 'm not debunking it . 
  it 's not an arguement . 
  same mistake again huh ? 
  allright i 'll just copy/paste :  see now that 's not even factually correct . 
  i was n't born on the island of great britain , ergo i 'm not british ( which is purely a geographical term after all ) . 
  that 's just your pride fucking with you . 
  of course they are . 
  and while you have admitted this entire arguement is based on your own personal national pride ( which , good for you mate ) this is a rather more important issue of * both * emotion * and * accuracy for the irish , who are not british , suffered horribly under the british , and are not keen to see an inaccurate term profiligsted by britain as a tool of oppression used inaccurately to describe what is not theirs . 
  hence , the term is not officially used anywhere . 
  did n't read . 
   britain is shorthand for great britain . 
  once again , stop trolling pindar . 
  i do n't think you understand that your arguement is incomprehensibly thin and looks psychotic .
