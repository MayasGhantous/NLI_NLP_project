  good . 
  blocked for being a completely shameless fucking idiot . 
  who set up the american political system ? 
  okay you 've asked this twice now so it 's obvious you actually believe they did n't now . 
  good arguement . 
  all people care about is getting the cheapest swill they can from the bucket into their mouths as fast as possible . 
  oh brexiters and their nonsense . 
  it does n't stop being a fact ( or become a `` fact '' ) because an alternative fact brexiteer wants it to be so . 
  indeed it is ? 
  did you get lost along the way somewhere ? 
  but enough about your penis . 
  jackass brexiters who do n't know their own governments hand behind these policies ? 
  you are if you 're the retailer importing it en masse as the basic function of your business . 
  do you honestly think i care what you have to say ? 
  do n't bother answering on your alt account , you 've just been blocked . 
  i 'll see you on your main account , 
  ** you : ** * '' ( oh snap this guy called me out on jumping on my alt to defend myself ) * uhh guys he 's saying everybody who disagrees with him is an alt !, 
  what a fascist , right ?! '', 
  ** goon 1 : ** `` no he 's not !, 
  he just said you are ! '', 
  ** goon 2 : ** `` plus , you 're a 6 day old account who follows around your main accounts posts ! '', 
  ** me : ** * watches wrestling *, 
  kudos to you for a ) trying to appear superior while saying `` retardation '' !, 
  b ) jumping on an alt to defend yourself !, 
   you should probably read my post before replying to it . 
  you have a real problem dealing with the statements in front of you as opposed to the ones you * wish * were in front of you . 
  again , it 's not my job to do your work for you . 
  you 're a proven hypocrite and argue in bad faith , i 've no obligation to educate you when i do n't fancy doing it . 
  it does n't matter if you know if it 's true . 
  your ignorance is not a defence against the fact . 
  you should probably read my post before replying to it . 
  super , then we agree this is because of brexit . 
  you 're the one who exploded , after all . 
  i was never sure why you were arguing with me in the first place . 
  i do n't have to prove a fact mate , it does n't rely on me proving it . 
  it does n't stop being a fact because of your ignorance . 
  on account of it being a fact . 
  you 're surprised that when you tried to paint the problem as anything other than brexit , that i called you out on causing this problem in the first place ? 
  ... dat do n't make no sense . 
  wow !, 
  er , okay ? 
  learn to take criticism of very simple holes in your arguement better in future , i guess ? 
  that 's down to you , is n't it ? 
  i 'm not sure why you 're suddenly confused to be talking about brexit in a thread dealing with brexit . 
  that 's when you are proving an arguement , not when you are referencing a fact . 
  i 'm not sure where you are getting confused ? 
  it was a very short post . 
  that 's the same arguement you could have for brexit and trump , being fair . 
  that 's cool , it 's not my job to do your work for you ,, 
  to be fair , they 're also letting this happen . 
  google 's right over there . 
  the problem is easily understood - brexit . 
  the cause is also easily understood - brexiteers . 
  as a chippy chirpy remainer from norn iron it 's quite clear to both camps whose to blame for this needless worry - you . 
  damn , if only we existed in the present instead of in 1970 so that my comment made sense and yours was redundant . 
  alas here we are in the distant past for the sake of your post . 
  the problem with this comment is all i can do is repeat it back to you . 
  why would anyone use your name when you 're paranoid enough to stalk their comments anyway ? 
  oh gosh are we ever . 
  you mean a tariff which your government helped create and then enforced , of course . 
  the wonder of talking to brexiteers . 
  are you saying you think this is going to help british farmers ? 
  and here we see the fatal flaw of the commonwealth branch of brexiteers - wanting the world to treat as they were in the 70s . 
  deciding a massively powerful lobby does n't matter because you do n't them to sounds like good reasoning . 
  mmm yes when the british people think luxury wine they definitely think of australia . 
  brexiteers : full of imagination , zero business sense . 
  i am fairly certain i could last 5 , maybe 6 minutes in this place . 
  i 'm super-tough . 
  you 're not quite sure because you read the first page of the first article you were able to find on google , hence you using a term they coin presuming it to be common parlance . 
  [ for the uninitiated . 
  ] ( https://fullfact.org/europe/uk-eu-trade/ ), 
  fair play to you for taking your advice from a daily mail article and then fudging * that * data too . 
  i get that you 're upset ( surprise surprise ) but neither of your points are beneficial for the uk . 
  also , neither are accurate . 
  48 % of your total exports go to the eu . 
  your economy depends upon it . 
  discussion ends . 
  pretty much the opposite for you , actually . 
  this post was made sitting in a council flat in the midlands jacking off while looking at a model spitfire over a princess diana memorative crockery set . 
  of course . 
  but total exports is the most important figure . 
  hence the oft-repeated statistic of the uk representing 15 % of eu exports while the eu represents 48 % of british exports . 
  your economy depends upon one statistic , not the other . 
  that 's why it 's more important . 
  this really should n't need explaining ? 
  that would put them in line with english farmers who voted for brexit , certainly . 
  might as well just copy-paste this :  48 % of british exports go to the eu . 
  15 % of eu exports go to the u.k.  your economy depends upon the eu . 
  discussion ends . 
  48 % of british exports go to the eu . 
  15 % of eu exports go to the u.k. 
  your economy depends upon the eu . 
  discussion ends . 
  so , now it begins ... 
  god damn slovenia , get a film industry already . 
  an international overhaul of american-dominated copyright protection is long overdue . 
  it would be great if europe were the ones to finally push it . 
  well , * you * ca n't . 
  scumbags . 
  excellent , happy to see this cooperative , cross-boarders attitude arise !,
