  absolute fear-mongering . 
   correct me if i 'm wrong but i do n't think that subsaharan mercenaries thing was ever substantiated . 
  most likely it was just war propaganda , and used by the libyan rebels to justify their genocide of the black africans residing in libya . 
  just a psa that this is the guy currently sitting in / r/the _ donald talking about [ `` rapefugees '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/6c54fh/europe_stops_for_1_week_all_refugees_for_the_g7/dhs2ing/?context=3 ) so i 'm not entirely convinced on his concern for africans here . 
  i 'm ignorant to the risks . 
  are we talking about someone hacking the voting website to effect the votes ? 
  is that even possible ? 
  look at the kerfuffle around russia and whatever nebulous thing they did with the us election . 
  i hope they named that house * moss * eisley . 
  i think they just call it a suplex . 
  do n't estonia already do something similar to e-voting , or am i getting confused ? 
  lower the voting age and make e-voting a reliable alternative and watch those numbers soar . 
  those who do not learn from history are doomed to say what you just said . 
  sensible policies for a bright future ? 
  works for me . 
  his belief was based on a misunderstanding of a platform that itself was completely false . 
   i 'm aware that there were uvf and uda supporters within the uk civil service and military who abused their positions . 
  i 'm intrigued by this notion you seem to be sheltering that your government did n't collude with loyalist paramilitaries to murder civilians in northern ireland ( as opposed to rogue agents `` abusing their positions '' ) . 
  it 's completely false , however . 
  here 's a quick reading list :  [ london told it must face up to collusion in the north ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/london-told-it-must-face-up-to-fact-of-collusion-in-north-1.2250653 )  [ britain 's secret terror deals ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/britains-secret-terror-deals-truly-disturbing-bbc-panorama-allegations-of-collusion-must-be-fully-investigated-says-amnesty-international-31261593.html )  [ an expos\u00e9 on collusion ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/what-we-learned-from-collusion-documentary-2165163-jun2015/ )  [ army colluded with loyalist killers ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/2955941.stm )  [ the collusion of operation banner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_banner#collusion_with_loyalist_paramilitaries )  [ criminal convictions of the udr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ulster_defence_regiment#criminal_convictions )  [ collusion of the british security forces with ulster loyalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ulster_loyalism#collusion_with_the_security_forces )  [ the stevens inquiries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stevens_inquiries )  [ the force research unit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/force_research_unit )  [ the military reaction force ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_reaction_force )  [ the special reconnaissance unit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_reconnaissance_unit )  [ the glenanne gang - a secret militant alliance of british soldiers , ruc officers and loyalist paramilitaries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glenanne_gang ), 
  my apologies , i 've amended my post to correctly reflect the assault rifles that english soldiers were pointing at us . 
  i 'm irish while being a british citizen and am part of the nationalist community which makes up half of northern ireland . 
  which is harder to you : your passport or an fn fal pointed at your face by someone from across the seas who thinks you and your kid brother are terrorists ? 
  as a northern ironer , i cringe much more when i see reactions like yours . 
   i 'd note that there was n't a hard border in ni before the eu got involved , as a northern irishman who grew up 5 miles from the border , i can assure you there was a hard border before the eu got involved . 
  the border and the arbitrary partition which created it where entirely britain 's creation . 
  although apparently the english do n't get taught this in their own curriculums , which surprised me considerably when i first learned about it . 
  the only rifle he 'll be picking up is on rupert murdoch 's expansive estate in texas to shoot whatever the texan equivalent of clay pigeons are . 
  god help england if it listens to this man a second longer . 
  so he opposed brexit insofar that he disagreed with their anti-immigration platform but supported it in that he thought he could abuse that platform to suit his own ends ? 
  sounds like a perfect storm of arseholes hurting arseholes . 
  `` it blocks line of sight to lovely architecture . '', 
  i 'm not the person to defend this . 
  i think it 's a crap policy . 
  the most obvious one i 'm aware of is the one preventing building anything larger than 4 stories outside of the docklands , and even there you can only build 12 i think . 
  i 'm sure there 's some shite about making new housing difficult as well . 
  he 's uncomfortable shaking that part of women . 
   ` best ' for whom ? 
  germany it seems . 
  so nobody 's going to mention the fact that he arbitrarily drew a connection here without substantiating it ? 
  we 're just going to upvote him because fuck the germans ? 
  okay lads . 
  well done there . 
   democracy is only welcome in the eu when it means the people will vote to reduce their own power . 
  it 's not like this is anything new , standard pro-eu politician tactics . 
  as a citizen of both , you seem to have the eu mixed up with the uk . 
  because since we voted for brexit that 's all we 've gotten - less rights , less privileges , more snooper charters 1.0 & 2.0 . 
  oh how i long for the eu and their checks on this nonsense . 
  do n't worry , i 'll keep you right . 
  when even maggie thatcher agrees with you when you say something sucks , you know it sucks . 
  brexiteer trying to make his mistake work , news at 11 . 
  macron will just take a page from trudeau 's book and send a pre-emptive handshake salvo before trump is ready to engage . 
  a darkhorse , an outsider !, 
  a dangerous rebel on the wrong side of the law !, 
  * chews toothpick and glowers *, 
  good for them . 
  legalizing cannabis and rolling back the surveillance state are two very progressive policy platforms , they 'd almost be a canadian party . 
  of course nobody in england will actually * vote * for these people because elections are dictated by scandal , not policy , and even i still remember their baffling coalition with the tories . 
  that 's really only a problem for the locals . 
  the bankers wo n't give a toss , and that 's who the city council care about . 
  you 've got over 30 posts in this thread . 
  please calm down and stop with this embarrassing victim complex , it 's makinyou look very silly . 
  pretty much the movie * snatch . 
  if you still lost then it was n't an amazing opera . 
   '' ... pursuing the story across the internet ? '', 
  what ? 
  that 's the point . 
  good news ? 
  seeing as the rest of this thread is a disaster led by americans and ann english poster , i 'll just say that looks very nice and move on . 
  when you 're dealing with movements that explicitly try to co-opt nationalism , such as brexit . 
  it 's repeated all the time in pro-brexit media that brexiteers are brace nationalists and everyone else are saboteurs and enemies of the people . 
  leave it to the little guys , eh ? 
  like i said then . 
  that 's two bigoted comments you 've made in 5 minutes . 
  please respect subreddit rules in future . 
  no offence meant . 
  well done barcelona !, 
  oh , the ones that matter are n't getting annoyed . 
  you brexiteers are really bonkers . 
  here 's a hint from a country that used to be in someone else 's empire - if you can leave it voluntarily , it is n't one . 
  it 's tough being a remainer with only the lib dems and tony blair looking out for you . 
  are they ? 
  do you have a link to that ? 
  it 's not in this article . 
  i 'm sorry your political decision is n't going the way you wanted it to , i guess ? 
  what does it being democratic have to do with it ? 
  it 's simply now a business transaction between unequal parties . 
  are you having a stroke ? 
  fuck , that is something else . 
  well done spain . 
  there you are then , the vitriol is even sillier . 
  i work in toronto actually !, 
  i did n't actually realize the `` asian glow '' thing was legit until my friends were slumped over in raiders after a single cocktail and a shot of jameison . 
  no no mate , do n't stop !, 
  keep paddling back to england where you do n't have to understand what you 're doing and you lose all your rights because some rich toffs tricked you into it , 
  back you sail on your ship of tears !, 
  have fun losing the rights that i get to keep because you were dumb enough to vote for a campaign built to fail !, 
  i do n't care if you support it mate . 
  this is an internet argument between 2 people . 
  i 'm here to mock you , because you 're a plastic brexiter ,
