  pablo 's one of those `` plastic brexiteers '' who does n't understand the platform but just argues on behalf of it . 
  he read it in the sun and was told it was a good idea , so it must be a good idea !, 
   do n't even know what point you 're talking about mate that 's what you 're known for buddy . 
   `` the point wo n't be proven if i whine *** even harder *** about it ! '', 
   yeah i do , but then i think , `` hey , atleast i 'm not as lame as / u/finndacool '' and manage the strength to pull myself out of my depressive pit in order to laugh at the butthurt you endlessly flaunt for my enjoyment . 
  holy shit i actually called it . 
   `` the point wo n't be proven if i whine even * harder * about it ! '', 
  do you never get depressed that you 're just not witty ? 
  edit : hold on let me respond for / u/pablopeublo here : do you never get depressed that * butthurt ? 
  point proven . 
  when you staff your team with brexiteers you trade competence for commitment . 
  was that whine predictably banal or banally predictable ? 
  hmmm . 
  taking a short-term bullet for long-term stability and independence . 
  well done the baltics !, 
  that 's what taking back sovereignty * actually * looks like !, 
  i want this to start a trend of every county , town , village , street , home and family member seceding until it 's all just a bunch of left and right frontal lobes firing synapses at each other . 
  i 'm pretty sure i 've visited here when i was playing soul calibur . 
  cautious optimism ? 
  wet cobblestones , overcast sky , sun breaking through over the eiffel tower , old gas-lamp , romantic bridge-d\u00e9cor ; all it 's missing is one japanese tourist having a break down . 
  see also : scotland , northern ireland ; indyref remain campaign . 
  it 's not nearly as prolific as the brits coming out ( after slagging the eu off endlessly ) and moaning about how hard done by ( ? ), 
  they are . 
  to quote one of the endless brexiteer slogans :  `` when forced to choose between europe and the sea , britain will always choose the sea . '', 
  - wintston `` rule britannia '' churchill sir , i present to you the sea . 
  that 's true . 
  it 's got all those hops and wheat in there . 
  those 're vegetables . 
  vegetables are healthy . 
  everyone knows that . 
   singaporeans , not so much . 
  singaporeans after one beer are pretty much westerners after seven . 
  having a drink with juncker sounds like the definition of a miserable time , matched only by having a drink with theresa may who just keeps ordering `` whatever thatcher had , with tonic . '', 
  we call op 's ma the celtic cougar . 
  i thought he was from kazakhstan ? 
  you 're aware banksy is english ? 
  where 's he going to go , back to england ? 
  cautious optimism !, 
  it 's nice to see a rare bit of news for ukrainians in the ongoing tire-fire that is their national situation . 
  `` hey chris , i got you something !, 
  `` oh boy , thanks kevin ! '', 
  * opens present * `` why 's the snooper 's charter on this list ? '', 
  ignore this waste of space , please . 
  fuck me have some self-respect . 
  when some dumb fuck wears that flag and tries to lie about how we all think he 's going to get raked over the coals about it . 
  now defend yourself or piss off you daft cunt . 
   `` democratic people 's republic of korea '' and he responds to a link on the definition of what a federation is with the phrase `` democratic people 's republic of korea . '', 
  seems like a reasonable guy . 
   not really , ireland ca n't survive outside the eu , we 're dependent on it for so many things . 
  we 're dependant on it for benefits because it gives us massive benefits . 
  without them we would not have these benefits . 
  if at any point this discussion is going too fast for you , please let me know . 
  i 'll send it by post to your woodland cottage in the 18th century . 
   a single unified state needs a capital , seeing how this where the eu is based i do n't think it 's a massive fucking leap to assume that 's where the capital would be . 
  we already have that so who gives a fuck ? 
  i did n't grow up in dublin but i seem to suffer you dopes running the place , and they 've done a damn better job of running the eu than you have of running the country . 
  you want to believe in this fiction where an evil empire takes over and treads you into the ground , which is just fucking bizarre . 
   all this projection not a very big leap is it mate ? 
   in favor of being in the eu = / = wanting to be part of a european flag under one flag . 
  it 's by far more support of * that * than it is off your weird little fantasy where we 're all outraged at being trodden underfoot by johnny belgian because of `` muh sovereignty . '', 
   hahahahaha , yeah you showed me mate , you created an argument in your own head and had it go the way you wanted it be and then tried to use it as evidence , holy fuck that is amazingly retarded . 
  is this guy for real or does he actually lack all self-awareness ? 
  shall i drag up his post about `` national sovereignty and love of country '' for you all to giggle at ? 
   says who ? 
  the [ definition ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federation ) of what a federation is you tit . 
  you want it to be an empire so you can wank off about sovereignty and lack of representation . 
   forcing them if this eu army gets traction , making them dependent on the eu for grants and subsidies so much that your country becomes nearly utterly dependent . 
  which is a movie script , not reality . 
  [ by most accounts ] ( https://www.rte.ie/news/2017/0509/873610-eu_poll/ ) it looks like people will be fore the opposite of what this guy is for . 
  so hurrah for common sense . 
  `` hey this knob thinks we 'll be ruled from brussels . '', 
  `` what ? 
  is he aware of what a representative democracy is or how the eu is specifically tailored to respect the rights of smaller states and cultures ? '', 
  `` nah he just reads the british papers and laps up every allusion he can find to absolute monarchy and does n't think for himself . '', 
  [ `` so he does n't even know we 're massively in favour of the eu in a general sense , then ? 
  '' ] ( https://www.rte.ie/news/2017/0509/873610-eu_poll/ ) `` do n't think he cares mate . 
  he 's probably one of those i 've - got-my-opinion-and-damn-the-evidence types . '', 
  `` oh so a brexiter ? '', 
  `` yeah . '', 
  *** `` yeah . 
  you do n't you weirdo . 
  jesus you 're the only irishman on earth who actually says `` larper , '' that 's enough of a giveaway you 're past your sell-by . 
  i 'm glad you do n't speak for most people . 
  it looks * exactly * like artwork from civilization 5 . 
  i remember him as that fox guy from dogtanian and the muskahounds !, 
  i am not a cultured man . 
  it 's wonderful to share in optimism for a change , and here 's to everyone who takes part in this remarkable project of ours !, 
  cheers !, 
   yes , that 's exactly my point . 
  what 's your point ? 
   our army is 1/4 of the size of the reserves of the french army . 
  why not just leave them to it ? 
  why should we ? 
   i 'd much rather ireland simply remain neutral and let them take care of any threat to the eu . 
  that 's fine , but it 's your personal preference and it does n't seem to be based on anything other than relying on others . 
   what need do we have to be defended , who 's going to attack us ? 
  and again  `` it 's safe now and it will always be like this '' is not a smart policy platform whether the danger be islamic terrorism or whatever comes next . 
  there will always be threats to security and so the mechanisms of security should be as strong and skilled as possible . 
   ok , you 've made the point that we 're not going to be expected to do as much as the big powers ; who was expecting that in the first place ? 
  why did you base your post around that assumption ?
