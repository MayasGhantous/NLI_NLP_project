  when [ your very first post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/612ruo/the_eu_is_60_and_it_helped_my_generation_fall_in/dfbbw6b/ ) is a vague rightwing soliloquy attacking the author with a bed of flowery prose hiding a baseless opinion and then rally behind that opinion with a rail against being chastised , at least have the good grace to present the grounds for your waffling with something better than telegraph-esque appeals to my better nature . 
  because i assure you , it does n't exist . 
  in this world you have to substantiate your argument . 
  you are n't in the rightwing media now - back up your words with grounding or watch your house crumble around you . 
  now - what was your problem with the article ? 
  i could well believe it from what i 've heard , but i 've never looked seriously into the issue of the treatment of kurds in turkey ( though i do learn a little by osmosis ) so i 'll keep my mouth shut . 
  that 's the rightwing british press except you left out the bit where they use words like `` luvvie '' to trick the masses into voting against checks on government and the media , and they do n't give a damn about whether the plebs understand them or not . 
  either america by several measures . 
  a better question would be which continent has made such strives of cohesion and progressive brotherhood since then ? 
  the union is utterly unique in what it 's accomplishing . 
  [ now , i 'm not saying this is a plant , but this sure smells like a plant  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/610lgs/we_must_deny_terrorists_the_disproportionate/dfbe9po/?context=3 )  i was born in the uk actually . 
  i left because i 'm not too interested in living in a hyperconservative shithole . 
  in the event that this is n't a plant and those are your genuine opinions , i 'll just say this : abandoning your principles because of the actions of others speaks poorly of you but poorer still of your principles . 
  half of the uk already wants back in . 
  i 'd make that path easier for them than try to batter sun-readers . 
  why do i feel like i 'm talking to a tabloid-hating tabloid journalist ? 
  is it the penchant for hyperbole , the flowery prose draped over seething distaste , or both being employed in defense of conservative political opinion ? 
  europe is not by it 's nature something worthy of love . 
  it has been the most oppressive , the most amoral and the most warlike and genocidal of places on earth in turns throughout it 's history . 
  it was one such place up to ( and including the soviet satellite states ) during the eu . 
  the spirit of togetherness , of celebration of culture , of protection of citizens from corruption and unchecked governments , of brotherhood , of science and enterprise across borders is what makes it all worthy of praise . 
  i agree with the notion that integration needs to become a priority ( not just for the united kingdom , but for all western societies who have been pretty lax in this ) as far as forcing immigrants to learn the language and abandon old customs goes ( looking at you , shariah courts ) but i 'm not sure what policies could be enacted to stop acts like this . 
  the simple fact of the matter is if an average man wakes up in the morning convinced that he 's going to murder people anyway he can , there 's bugger can be done to stop him until he does it . 
  i agree that there 's an onus on every citizen to pay more attention to what 's happening elsewhere , as it will affect you . 
  if you do n't you 'll end up like boris johnson 's readers , believing in all earnestness what he readily admits were years of lies to sell newspapers . 
  and then you 're convinced to lose your own privileges for no reason and much harm . 
  it does n't make sense as anything but a cautionary tale . 
  are n't strawmen usually better placed in a field than in a forum ? 
  i really have no idea what you 're trying to say here . 
  you do n't like article writers ? 
  is n't that what * all * british media exists to do ? 
  or have the sun and the daily mail ceased to exist since this morning ? 
  you will , you 'll just have to line-up with everybody else for a reason purely of your own choosing . 
  when you are reduced to ( or rise to ) a certain quality of life , all that you need is a cause , i guess . 
  / u/blussy96 just posts everyday about how everyone on / r/europe hates the uk . 
  he likes to paint the english as being oppressed by ... everyone ? 
   not talking about the history of the british empire though , talking about the uk and germany during world war 2 . 
   [ even so , i 'm getting bored of irish redditors who hate brits so much that they think nazis were better people . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/60fyhm/theresa_may_to_trigger_article_50_on_29_march/df6wkp3/?context=3 )  [ i hope you are saying this to every scot who wants to leave . 
  but no , you are obviously only saying this to english people . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/60g4al/uk_getting_happier_despite_brexit_uncertainty/df6sjtt/?context=3 )  [ indeed , you are only allowed to insult the english on this sub , the welsh do n't deserve anything . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/60fyhm/theresa_may_to_trigger_article_50_on_29_march/df6eeah/?context=3 )  [ to be fair , have you seen some of the comments in this thread about ww2 ? 
  i 'm certain that half the people here think that brits were worse than the nazis . 
  it 's actually funny how brits get more hate than the nazis , i have never seen the nazis been blamed for anything on this sub . 
  only ever brits and russians . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/60fyhm/theresa_may_to_trigger_article_50_on_29_march/df6e49w/?context=3 ) these are all from * today , * by the by . 
   the bastards killed far more than any other group , stop trying to twist the statistics to soften their image . 
  considering growing up in a nationalist area in ni i was told incessantly by the british media that the ira were inhuman monsters who were single-handedly responsible for everything that was going ( and which i 'm *** absolutely *** sure you in england still believe to this day , because when the fuck are you ever going to here anything to the contrary ? ), 
  i 'd say some perspective is definitely called for . 
  when did this happen ? 
  hi , norn irishmen here . 
  i 'm not comparing grief here - actually no , that 's * exactly * what i am doing - but we had this * from both communities * more regularly * for decades * on top of an oppressive state that did n't care about the nationalist community that 's on top of the punishment beatings , the kneecappings , the gang war ( because drug trade played a part in this , particularly in unionist areas ) , the ruc pulling you over and giving you a hiding , or just the army soldiers giving you a boot up the hole for standing in the square in your little nationalist town . 
   while loyalists got theirs from elements within the british army which is it 's own totally separate pile of stinky business , by the by . 
  the ruc was a particularly oppressive and militaristic body . 
  i can totally see a rational for excluding them from the civilian body , even if it 's unconventional . 
  oh gross , the brexiteer jumps into bigotry already and he 's making false equivalencies too . 
  he 's so gross . 
  imagine trying to equate a country of 55 million with a country of 5 million . 
  imagine trying to cheerlead england 's oppression of ireland , deporting food during the great famine , instituting the penal laws , outlawing catholocism , shooting protesting civilians because he 's having an internet arguement in 2017 and he wants to pretend english people are getting oppressed . 
  i 'll tell you what brexiteer , let me country run yours into the ground for 800 years then i 'll moan at you for kicking us out , m ` kay ? 
  so dishonest . 
  i would , but i 'm currently in toronto !, 
  i 'll be back next month though . 
  as regards invading other countries ? 
  what ? 
  is n't that just the same map ? 
  woo , we got one !, 
  oh my god , aol is still around ? 
  beautiful . 
  i love seeing these . 
  what a wonderful sentiment of togetherness and brotherhood . 
  an , lovely . 
  which hardly * anyone * is !, 
  our system works !, 
  i think in your butthurt passive aggression ( this just in - for the majority of your life scotland was a massive contributor to the uk , much more so than your home , england ) you missed the point that britain first is an actual organization that the chief staffer of question time is a follower of and advertizes for audience members on . 
  aaaand `` the page you are looking for does not exist . '', 
  the frequency of referendums . 
  of course you can . 
  i do n't care about your opinion . 
  i care about the right opinion . 
  considering qt audiences are staffed by britain first members i 'm not surprised . 
  you absolutely have . 
  there 's no rational behind it at all . 
  i feel like you 're just lying . 
  ew gross , it 's posting here now . 
  if anyone ever honestly thought that the they were a fucking idiot . 
  i feel like neither of those points are true as you 're presenting them . 
  that 's an arbitrary line you 've drawn for no reason other than it recently happened in your country . 
  because the people are stupid . 
  like holy fuck , i do n't care about your opinion on everything . 
  i really do n't . 
  you wo n't know enough to give valid counsel and you 'll just muddy everything up . 
  give me a right wing party who 's actually attempting to answer this and is not either using it as a scapegoat for some nefarious bullshit or criminally inept . 
   you think mass immi gration is limited to the ref ugee crisis . 
  not a good sign . 
  it 's been happening for decades why are you randomly adding spaces in the middle of words ? 
  immigration has been happening since man first shrugged out of the cave to have a wank , the issue is the refugee crisis and the economic migrants that seem to make up the majority of them . 
   2 . all attempts to codify european culture have failed because it 's basically a game of moral theatre this has nothing to do with anything i said , take your cultural argument elsewhere . 
   3 . we do n't even have a way of making groups adopt said cultural edifices we can decide upon of course we do you daft nelly , we 've had law enforcement services and organs of state for centuries . 
  well said that man .
