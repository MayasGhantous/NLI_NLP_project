  you can quote yourself as many times as you like ( extra point for calling the other guy intentionally obtuse with * zero * self-awareness ) , it 's still our choice and not yours . 
  i 'm not sure what 's confusing about that , but then you did get fooled into voting for brexit . 
   oh , so original ... call me a bigot . 
  have n't heard that one before . 
  oh i * fully * believe you have been called a bigot before . 
   lol playing that game . 
  i do n't even know what you 're talking about ... 
  i am shocked !, 
  truly shocked !, 
   never hearing of sovereignty before ? 
  well done you for remembering what we were accusing you of !, 
   we 've been talking about it all day , so why do n't you come up with a logical conclusion ? 
  a logical conclusion ... to an accusation i made against you ? 
  what ? 
  are you sure you know what logic is or is this just another word you 're co-opting like you co-opted sovereignty ? 
   a ) well , i turned the insult back on you ... so that makes you the baby lol wow it 's ... it 's like seeing a master painter at work . 
  as he suffers a crippling aneurysm . 
   b ) seems pretty straightforward to me . 
  you should know , you 're irish . 
  strike 2 for `` englishman uses brexit to indulge in bigotry ! '', 
  shock-horror , he 's just scared of non-english people swimming upstream and stealing his salmon . 
   c ) you mean the same uk that sacrificed thousands of lives to try and maintain the peace ? 
  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, 
   you 're big on pointless last wordisms . 
   you 're big on pointless last wordisms . 
  i think you 've gone a little crazy . 
  norn iron would similarly like to pass on her . 
  perhaps wales could take her ? 
  i always admire someone actually trying to say something important in the face of some loud idiot trying to dumb everything down . 
  i 'm not sure what 's confusing about `` it 's entirely our decision actually , '' but then you 've gone above and beyond in not knowing anything you 're discussing today . 
  this is me , being surprised that a brexiter uses his vote as a cover for bigoted english nationalism . 
  he 's still not denying it . 
  a ) aw , baby get his insult turned back on him ? 
  b ) so it 's a pointlessly broad statement that is n't effected by the built-to-fail campaign you voted for ? 
  colour me shocked !, 
  c ) northern irishmen live in a state built by the english to be prejudiced against them , and it took decades of violent conflict to bring in the eu and the american president to change that state of affairs , because english people supposedly ruling the uk did not give a shit for 7 decades . 
  but no-one expected a brexiter to actually * know * shit . 
  i 'm sure * believing * is enough for you . 
   you 're big on pointless lastwordisms . 
  you 're big on pointless last wordisms . 
  there was this madness called brexit . 
  a concept so foul and rooted in odious fearmongering and bigotry that northern ireland , scotland , wales and every other voting citizen of the united kingdom could have voted remain and england could still have dragged us kicking and screaming from the european union . 
  yep . 
   but this is irrelevant . 
  not to every single scottish constituency . 
  no , that 's different . 
  you english fanatics tried to make it for us , but instead we 'll make it without you , thanks . 
  pretty sure that 's what their votes for . 
  it 's entirely our decision , actually . 
  this is me , being shocked at a brexiter not knowing something . 
  you can repeat yourself all you want , every single scottish constituency still voted remain . 
  that does n't change just because you were gullible to vote for a campaign built to fail and now feel guilty about it . 
  i like the way he agreed with me about never hearing of sovereignty before . 
  a ) thank god , eh ? 
  b ) go on then , without googling . 
  c ) aw , reality hitting you hard little child of privilege ? 
  good !, 
  * waves tiny eu flags *, 
  people who paid attention to it where very aware of it ( we were even told about it in grammar school for example , though that was the northern ireland curriculum ) , but it 's absolutely fair to say that politicians and the media have been misleading the public about the eu for decades . 
  that 's why they 're now being told to be angry about what they knew was coming all along . 
  do n't worry , i 've got a plan !, 
  * throws blue and yellow confetti everywhere *, 
  problem with cherry picking your arguments is it does n't leave you with much of an argument . 
   ** you 're ** literally wrong . 
  *** i 'm *** right . 
  is there anything more pathetic than the brexiteer excited because he thinks he can finally claim he 's a victim of anti-english racism ? 
   lets throw a pity party and blame all the problems of ni on all the british in a generalisation . 
  gosh it 's almost like britain arbitrarily partitioned a country and then did n't care what happened to it for 7 decades . 
   all i can say is fuck off . 
  let democracy take its course or go and blow up some school children like a good ira boy . 
  again , i do n't think you understand what you 're talking about ? 
  half your country wants to remain . 
  you do n't get to make them disappear just like you made jo cox disappear . 
  i guess brexit is just a big sham that you fell for ? 
  there we are then !, 
  bare-faced hypocrisy - democracy when it suits me , bureaucracy when it does n't . 
  happily it 's not your decision to make in either case , it 's ours . 
   the only welsh party that supported brexit was ukip ( nowhere near 50 % ) . 
  no scottish party support brexit . 
  and thus every single scottish constituency voted remain . 
  voila - english nationalism failed to reach north of the border . 
   urgh do n't be petty , er , you not learning about this stuff in school is not me being petty . 
   that 's like saying the uk wants to stay because of the large amount who voted remain , this is how democracy works fella half your country does want to remain though ? 
  i guess you do n't understand what you 're talking about ? 
   there 's no oppression anymore , ni does very very well out of being in the uk and at the moment most irish realise they could n't afford the reunite if they wanted there 's * less * oppression because we had to struggle for decades very recently and see thousands of people die because of british misrule and indifference . 
  that 's simple reality . 
  it 's bizarre that you do n't know this but thought you could talk about it . 
  that 's exactly what it is . 
  * throws blue and yellow confetti everywhere *, 
  british papers would just be moaning even more loudly than usual against the scapegoat for all their problems . 
  itt comments by british posters that just make me want to leave the uk even more . 
  it 's honestly quite shocking . 
  hopefully we soon get that chance , we 're clearly better off separate . 
  jo cox just fell over did all on her own then , did she ? 
  they literally do n't learn about this in school . 
  it 's not national extremism when it 's half the country fighting for equal rights that the state wo n't give us . 
   irish nationalism has resulted in terrorism and deaths , so there is a difference . 
  as someone growing up in northern ireland who has seen people killed by both the british army , british police service and unionist paramilitaries ( state-sponsored , of course ) i 'm going to cheerfully tell you to go fuck yourself . 
   northern ireland ... who do n't want independence from the uk . 
  shall we have a referendum to decide that ?
