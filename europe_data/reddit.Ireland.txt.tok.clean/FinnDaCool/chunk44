  at the same time yeah i do n't think either of us are big fans of his . 
   they kept a minority in . 
  the majority of ni always wanted to stay . 
  that 's a confusingly worded sentence , so i 'm going to explain it better for everyone : britain drew the borders of northern ireland to keep as much land as possible while ensuring a loyal unionist majority . 
  which then oppressed the nationalist minority over the decades who were denied equal rights on voting , standing in government , housing , healthcare and not-having-the-shit-beaten-out-of-them-by-the-national-police-service-slash-army-delete-as-appropriate until literally * 1998 . 
  yep . 
  that 's your only defense huh ? 
  good grief . 
  i 'd also vote for them regardless of alignment because the nationalist parties have also been the most progressive - lgbt rights , education , much needed infrastructure investment in historically - * for whatever reason * - underfunded areas , and pro-eu policies are all things that i support regardless of colour of football jersey . 
  well , no . 
  not at all . 
  your vote is sectarian because you vote based on someone 's culture as opposed to their policy . 
  i 'm not agreeing/disagreeing with what / u/gerbaire said but i wanted to chime in on a few things you mentioned . 
   do n't forget , our country was devastated by world wars . 
  as was germany , poland and the baltics . 
  they were also then devastated by the ussr in prolonged mismanagement or outright oppression . 
  i 'm not attacking you here . 
  this is something i 'm constantly confused by the russian position on . 
  you were far from the only victims , and in many cases were far better off than others , but those peoples have since improved markedly more since their penumbra as far as living standards , corruption busting and the like go . 
   many families lost their loved ones in afghanistan and chechnya and i must point out that in both these conflicts the so called `` west '' was rooting for the other side . 
  well you * invaded * afghanistan for one . 
  i do n't recall people cheerleading the chechens at all , but russia did publicly turn it 's capital grozny into `` the most destroyed city on earth '' so perhaps there is some truth to that . 
   and to a plain average family seeing their dead children demonized hurt more than the unreasonableness of them being sent to those wars . 
  could you explain that one to me ? 
   we do value fairness . 
  that 's why there 's still a certain sense of bitterness , stoked by putin and his pet media . 
  if we did not value such things , the propaganda would n't take root . 
  i get that , but he 's also the one being unfair . 
  and he 's been allowed to * be * unfair for 18 years now . 
  there 's a point where responsibility swings back to the citizenry . 
  it 's been pretty complicated but we 're in a pretty straightforward scenario right now of waiting for the numbers to match up . 
   sometimes i really wonder how britain could stay so long a nation , because no one within britain seems to like britain , except for england . 
  well speaking from experience , in northern ireland they created the state and instituted a government that intentionally ( and later , through profound disinterest ) kept the people down that wanted out . 
  wales i dunno , they 're just like that . 
  oh i 'm sure we can make it click-baitier :  what does ** our maddie ** think of ** enemy of the state remoaners ** trying to ** sabotage ** agricultural subsidies ? 
  so sectarian voting , but * polite * sectarian voting . 
  ** the dup , ** ladies and gentlemen . 
  tactical voting to keep the taigs out , eh ? 
  good on you son . 
  oh look , it 's time for me to get downvoted by brexiteers for calling them out for moaning in every single thread about brexit . 
   just pull our security services and let france and germany deal with the bloodbath . 
  `` pull our security services '' ? 
  they need it , yeah , but they wo n't get it . 
  on account of half the country not wanting to leave the eu . 
  this ai n't exactly complicated . 
  i guess we 're some sort of * suicide squad , * huh ? 
  so he ca n't just fire his own finance minister because it would reflect badly at the polls ? 
  * waves miniature eu flags *, 
  i do n't know why the british press keeps trying to push this angle given that the numbers do n't support it , but here we are anyway , entertaining page-clicks . 
  does a dup voter care about poland or romania ? 
  of course not . 
  hell , a dup voter openly detests half of his own little country . 
  it 's always nice when hostile states openly declare their contempt en masse . 
  then we 've got nothing to discuss . 
  slump back off to your sultanate and brood on your misdeeds . 
  just super-briefly , what 's the immediate reason for this ? 
  yeah it 's very surprising . 
  just vote for the progressive guy next chance you get , really . 
  yep . 
  right in there good and deep . 
  i like that they 're planning to split italy into a north and south , and give the vatican to the north but rome to the south . 
  not too shabby . 
  blussy is , of course , a brexiteer and / r/ukpol is , predictably , brexit-friendly . 
  hence his little narrative he tried to push . 
  i 'm not actually saying that about blair . 
  meanwhile , bankers responsible for their share of the recession walk around freely . 
  * waves miniature flags for everyone *, 
  aw , currently engrossed in sunless seas on my ipad . 
  what a game !, 
  paywall . 
  a lot of us in the u.k. are hoping exactly this happens too . 
  good for her . 
  nice to see one member of the family has some principles . 
  throwing shade on the imf now ? 
  also : `` how much the economy has grown since ? '', 
  i 'm % 10,000 sure you arbitrarily substituting `` single market '' for `` free trade agreement without freedom of movement '' is based on nothing at all and matters not one whit to a single member of the public . 
  the free city of london ? 
  i 'd vote for him in a heartbeat over may or corbyn , he 's just more much capable as a leader and reflects my priorities much better than either of those two clowns . 
  `` iraq !, 
  tuition fees !, 
  secret catholic ! '', 
  god blair is so good at this stuff . 
  the unionists had the rights and privileges we did n't at the start of the troubles , as well as the backing of the british state and the ruc to enforce their misrule . 
  that was the problem . 
  that and reunification . 
  in return , fuck ignorant shitebags like yourself . 
  i would n't have the rights that i do now - rights that everyone else in this country had decades beforehand - but for those men and women , because neither the unionists in power nor the british government were interested in giving them to us . 
  am i happy a lot of people - including people * i and my family knew * - had to die ? 
  of course not . 
  but that absolutely had to happen , because neither you nor anyone else were interested in change otherwise . 
  we 'd still be second class citizens , fucking oppressed minotories in our own country . 
  you can disagree with that if you want , sitting in your position of privilege far away , but that does n't matter to any of us . 
  so fuck you because you think they just wanted to kill people for no reason . 
  if you 're going to walk into an arguement then educate yourself on it before entering . 
  and i do n't mean just reading the british fucking papers . 
  so i say again - fuck you and fuck your ignorance . 
  now fuck off . 
  that 's so confused it 's verging on incoherent . 
  did you actually read what i posted ? 
  that 's just baffling .
