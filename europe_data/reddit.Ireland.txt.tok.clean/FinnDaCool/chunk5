  i 'm certainly left wing in my politics but i can also acknowledge that the left has ceded this issue * entirely * to the political right and claimed anyone interested in immigration control is a racist or bigot . 
  if there is actual evidence behind something , it 's something we need to act upon * even if it makes people uncomfortable . 
  i do n't see anyone doing this , which is why i 'm talking about it . 
  because the left seems to have guilt-tripped itself into viewing any kind of immigration control as wrong and the right is just a fucking disaster of polemicists , tabloid-reading knuckle-draggers and 1 % ers . 
  hence why people should talk about this loudly , * all the time . 
  * i hear people moaning but not offering any solutions - here 's some from me , says i , use that as kindling for the conversation !, 
  ** little kid used splash !, 
  this kind of broad rightwing nonsense helps nobody . 
  here 's my personal input : the left ( of which i am a member ) has been completely disingenuous in the problems ( and yes , there are *** massive problems *** ) with immigration . 
  first and foremost : integration needs to be the priority , and it needs to be enforced * vigorously . 
  * for my take this means you adopt the dominant language of the nation you emigrate to ( or seek refuge in ) and you speak that language at a *** strong *** level - not basic , * strong * - by 5 years or you are automatically expelled from the nation and the eu as a whole . 
  if you are the mother or father to a family this means your * entire * family leaves with you . 
  yes it 's hard : it 's supposed to be . 
  i 've lived the immigrant life with pennies in my bank account and scant time for myself , but it 's a life * i knew * would come with certain expectations . 
  secondly all non-national , non-secular , quaif-official courts are gone . 
  flat out , immediately made illegal with anyone found acting as an unofficial magistrate looking at jail time and anyone found using these services facing a financial penalty or imprisonment . 
  yes this means shariah is gone . 
  these are western , secular nations where the same laws apply to everybody . 
  * counselling * is still permitted , but nothing attempting to masquerade as a binding or enforceable decision with the threat of the law behind it can be reasonably allowed to exist . 
  thirdly the influx of refugees needs to stop . 
  i do n't know about the opinion on reddit , but out there in the real world poll after poll after poll shows people have long been fed up with the inability to manage this crisis and the * disinterest * of politicians in attacking it . 
  when this failure on the political level can be used by right-wing polemicists as fuel for anti-eu movements , where we 're actually damaging a massively beneficial union that helps * us ? 
  * then measures need to be taken . 
  for me that means an immediate shutting the door on any more intake of any refugees beyond those * currently being processed at this very minute . 
  * funding will go to the frontline nations - spain , italy , greece - in assisting them manage the border and transport anyone trying to cross it back to their *** presumed point of origin . 
  *** if need by leaving them on a dock in a random town in north africa . 
  if you 're going to gamble with your life and endanger the livelihoods of those in europe while not cooperating with border officials there to do their job then you need to know you are going to lose . 
  perhaps this will convince saudi arabia and the uae to admit ** one ** refugee , though i doubt it . 
  our concern has to be us first , refugees second . 
  finally the source of the refugee wave needs to be addressed - the war in syria needs to end and end now . 
  if this means assad is still in power then fine , these people need to be able to go home . 
  of course they do . 
  they 're also entirely separate bodies , one of which does n't include the united states . 
  while their goals may overlap , they 're not the same . 
  in fact , the only reason you think they 're similar is because they share policy ( as many do ) on your country of birth . 
  you made a ridiculous statement and defended it by saying `` let 's not get bogged down in technicalities , '' i responded by showing you where the conversation goes if we all made statements like you did . 
  i thought we were n't getting bogged down in technicalities ? 
  no i 'm getting at the fact that if you actually cared about parasites you 'd tackle the large ones instead of the small ones . 
  but you do n't care about the parasites , you just want a target for your anger that wo n't fight back . 
  sure but then we 're describing rufed as a gangster state and putin as * vor * and tzar . 
  i mean , if we 're not getting into technicalities . 
  no i 'm saying like 70 % of russia 's money is own by the top 1 % and it 's got systemic problems with corruption so if you 're talking about parasites you 're talking about a huge segment of your own country rather than the poor bastards over in belarus toiling under * their * dictator . 
   it 's time to cut off the freeloaders who 've been sucking our money for more than 25 years now . 
  the interesting thing about this is that it 's only helping out nicola sturgeon . 
  now she looks like the voice of the people that this * bafflingly * incompetent interim-pm is trying to silence . 
  now that 's not precisely the case , but it 's a very compelling narrative and it 's not exactly far from the truth either . 
   it 's time to cut off the freeloaders who 've been sucking our money for more than 25 years now . 
  you 'd better be prepared to turn your country into swiss cheese then . 
  right . 
  right and what ? 
   scottish nationalists want another referendum for independence , they were banking on england voting out and scotland voting in . 
  putting aside the pettiness of this ; they got exactly what they wanted then . 
   they wanted the uk to vote out for a chance at a second referendum . 
  i live in scotland , i hear it daily . 
  i would say a lot of them ( not most ) do n't even like the eu . 
  hooray for you and your social circle . 
  this is so fucking unabashed . 
  he 's already going to be president for life and russians are entirely on board with the idea , so why would he put the target on himself by calling himself a king ? 
  he 's already got more money and power than any man on earth . 
  scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  well , brexit was certainly in large part about that . 
  they sponsor right-wing nationalist groups across the eu . 
  they actively supported this . 
  he definitely had a hand in it , but this was more britain 's love affair with unchecked right-wing media and political scapegoating coming home to roost . 
  you 've still to explain how it 's either of those things . 
  in pragmatic reality however they are entirely secular with secular laws . 
  you 're aware that wars can be waged for reasons * other * than religion , right ? 
  because you seriously seem to be implying that because * and purely because * south sudan is a majoriy christian country that it 's civil war must be because of religion . 
  in addition to the fact that it is n't . 
  am i ? 
  every christian society i can think of has become a secular society with secular laws , with the obvious exception of the vatican . 
  am i missing any ? 
  then what a pointless tangent this was just to say you do n't believe in religion . 
  it 's a false equivalency to equate modern christian and muslim societies when you 're discussing modern christian and muslim societies ? 
  the south sudanese civil war is irreligious . 
  * that * is a false equivalency . 
  you tried to equate both men in the most nonsensical fashion , as if they had dictated to their followers to wage war through the centuries when one in particular preached the exact opposite of that . 
  this is the very beating heart of the misguided atheist . 
  i 'm not arguing that geert wilders is brave ( i do n't like the man at all ) i 'm drawing focus on the false equivalency you posted . 
  how is it that , exactly ? 
  given every single christian society is a secular society , not really no . 
  given that a majority of muslim societies have the death penalty for profaning the image of the prophet ? 
  i kinda come down on his side on this one . 
  i 'm pretty sure even to the most cynical mind `` paedophile warlord '' outranks `` desert hobo . '', 
  i 'm pretty sure most muslims would tell you that mohammed 's actions are n't irrelevant today . 
  well yes , that 's what happens when you hear something you do n't like but you 've got no way of refuting it . 
  maybe london wants to remain in the eu under ours ? 
  before anyone asks , yes he is a hardline unionist dup supporter . 
  `` get to dah choppah ! '', 
  aw , see that 's nice . 
  ataturk 's a hero there though , right ? 
  surely you mean scentrance . 
  * waves miniature tricolours and eu flags *, 
  what was the instigating incident ? 
  the arab spring ? 
  cutting slack meaning what in that instance ? 
  not talking about it in a negative context ? 
  if we have n't been cutting them some slack i do n't know what we have been doing . 
  i think drawing the line at inciting and sponsoring secessionist movements within other countries borders is a very reasonable position .
