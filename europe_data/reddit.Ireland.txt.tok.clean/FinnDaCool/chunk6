  i 'm confused by you referring to him as `` not starting out this way '' and then referencing a decade 's worth of autocracy by his hand . 
   matthew ellery , research executive at * get britain out * mmm yes , this sounds like a reasonable source . 
  aaaand he 's quoting the 350 million to the nhs figure , world war 3 , spending cuts predicated upon article 50 without mentioning article 50 , aaaand we 're done . 
  he 's lying about lies . 
  well done / u/flapps , you 've outdone yourself . 
  for an englishman you seem awfully suspicious . 
  well i 'm originally from ulster anyway , but yeah every cloud and all that . 
   well if not gaining the millions of muslims which do n't exist  that will receive their european passport which does n't exist  in a few years from germany and sweden ( which they 're entitled to after living in europe for 5 years ) citation needed  then i guess we do have nothing to gain !, 
  thank fuck for that !, 
  good to know you 're a `` fuck the muslims '' brexiter . 
   i look forward to your next post telling me ` derpy derpy ur a racist derpy derrr ' what do you want , man ? 
  you 've made a post citing made-up nonsense crowing about how happy you are you do n't have to deal with muslims ? 
  what would you make of someone who said that ? 
  oh good grief is that what you 're doing now ? 
  allright :  brexit was a needless self-wound with zero gain , promising nothing in return for a loss of benefits and privileges for the working man and business and the economic futures of themselves and their children . 
  i look forward to your next post telling me `` nuh uh ! '', 
  no , because it 's a needless self-wound with zero gain . 
  not being a part of brexit feels like a good move for everybody . 
  i imagine half of england wishes they were in that boat . 
  shock horror , he 's got no response . 
  good thing too . 
  this is an absolute black-and-white situation where one party is clearly in the wrong and one party is clearly in the right . 
  this argument is so absurd to begin with . 
   scotland leaving would be the end of the uk . 
  well , quite literally in a very * particular * sense : the * united kingdoms * referenced in the name are the kingdoms of england , ireland and scotland . 
  there 's no kingdom of northern ireland and there never was of wales ( to my knowledge anyhow ) . 
  it 'd just be the kingdom of england and wales . 
  i would assume anyone who 's been living and working in scotland for a particular period of time ( whatever it is ) would have the option to vote . 
   if only spain was like the uk and respected your right to sovereignty . 
  hmmm . 
  brexit : still a dumb idea . 
   nope . 
  i think you 're falling into one of those thinking you 're cleverer than you are type deals . 
  it snows here like once a decade . 
  hooray !, 
  there is clear opposition to the eu based in ignorance ( brexit ) or hate ( putin , trump ) or both ( brexit , trump ) . 
  this is a reaction to that , i would imagine , and it 's really nice to see imo . 
  very nice , but my toes are getting cold just looking at it . 
  needs less lions and more harps . 
  i totally will and fully support it , but i 'm working in toronto , 
  who do you think is organizing them exactly ? 
  doctor evil 's non-union german equivalent , mediziner schlecht ? 
  well done !, 
  we should all show such solidarity with the netherlands over this . 
  i do n't think the turks realize how little this means to the dutch or how negligible a chance they have in changing their decisions . 
  hah , very nice . 
  i like this little movement . 
  i 'm sympathetic to the dutch , but i 'm totally on board that this is a sign that the west needs to be stricter in enforcing integration after immigration . 
  romania 's just looking smugly at bulgaria going `` eh ? 
   i 've said it once and i 'll say it again , the eu should be funded exclusively by a eu-wide 10 % corporation tax . 
  i like you good buddy , but that 's gon na be a veto right there . 
   seeing redditors abandon their own integrity to try to pretend russia did n't invade crimea or that trump never made fun of republicans is one thing , but seeing / u/dokky try the exact same tactic for a universal arguement from 2 summers ago is so staggeringly an indictment of how dishonest he is that 's it 's shocking . 
  these kind of tactics always say so much about the user , and it 's always the same : we ca n't deal with reality , so we 're trying to pretend it did n't happen . 
   ~ ~ i assume you feel embarrassed , and i hope you never use this tactic again . ~ ~, 
  your entire thought process is this : * house prices are going up * it must be because of immigrants !, 
  that 's it . 
  that 's literally your entire logic vetting for this . 
  are you not staggered by the insanity of this statement ? 
  there 's no mention of inflation , the wage gap , urbanization , the decline of manufacturing , gentrification , housing bubbles , speculation , public policy , nothing . 
  among other things , yes . 
  we both know you 're not . 
   and in the meantime , if any dutch citizens are in need of consular assistance in turkey , they can go to any embassy or consulate belonging to a eu country and recieve the same level of service as they would at the dutch consulate because eu fuck yeah . 
   that 's fucking important info , brah . 
  good on you !, 
  cameron offered the referendum and set the terms of it . 
  state means country , hence the confusing nature of the united kingdom being a `` nation of nations '' bound originally in conquest and plotting . 
  it 's almost like 2 people disagree with you . 
  oh so this is nothing unusual then ? 
  that 's your arguement . 
  you seriously thought you could get someone to back down by failing to provide a source for your own arguement ? 
  see i 'm particularly stupid so i do n't know if you 're joking or not . 
  we 're not talking about insults mate , we 're talking about the need for sourcing your statements to offset later whining when people do n't agree . 
  when 's the last time the netherlands had a single ruling party ? 
  you need a source if you 're going to post it on a subreddit and then later whine incredulously about why people do n't agree with the opinion you plucked from the air and how they 're all smelly fisheads . 
  so speaking as you would to a particularly * stupid * child , could someone explain to me what 's probably likely to happen here ? 
  i do n't care at all if you want to pretend i 'm actually / u/monaoeda because you ca n't deal with criticism . 
  if it bothered you enough you 'd message a mod to check , but then they 'd just pop your little bubble for you and you ca n't have that . 
  your opinion is also unsourced , champ . 
  now , see , he 's actually going to believe you though . 
  is that like fake news ? 
  you trump really have a hard time dealing with being wrong , do n't you ? 
  would you agree that 's your learned behavior or something psychological ? 
  i have literally zero knowledge of the political or cultural trends in mann to be fair but i always assumed you were mostly relatively happy with the current situation . 
  is there a drawback to being a crown dependency rather than just a `` sovereign '' part of the uk ? 
  hello . 
  actually downvotes mean that people view his unsourced opinion as non-constructive , and your piggybacking on that is just the little echo-chamber you like to live in .

  these are simple reddit responses to arguments on reddit .
