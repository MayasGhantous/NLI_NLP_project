   i was talking about turkey and france . 
  turkey is traditionally a threat to greece . 
  we do n't have problems with other me countries , in fact we are probably among the most friendly europeans to them . 
  then i misunderstood . 
  my bad . 
   i think you 're saying that only the northern block are allowed to have opinions . 
  no , you failed to substantiate your arguement and you tried to make it a nationalistic complain instead of you simply messing up . 
  greece is the only country in the european union ( and one of only 3 in all of europe ) with anything remotely resembling a positive opinion of russia . 
  you mistook your country 's opinion for one that was shared elsehwere and rather than accepting that you were in the minority in this tried to turn this into an issue of `` southern europe '' ( all of who bar yourselves and serbia hold a negative view of russia ) versus `` northern eurppe '' ( all of who share a negative view of russia ) . 
  pretending that greeks view turkey and the middle east in a positive light is absolutely putting words in the mouths of others . 
   southern european countries do not all consider russia the thread that the baltic countries see you 're attempting to speak for others here when you should only be speaking for yourself , as i am . 
  perception of a problem is no correlation to it 's existence . 
  the vast majority to european citizens in every opinion poll on the subject over the past number of years see russia overwhelmingly as hostile . 
  that 's simple reality . 
  attempting to put your words in the mouths of others does n't really effect that . 
   during the greek crisis of 2015 , greece seeked a loan from the russians for example . 
  this is a curious rational to give seeing that greece received substantially * more * money from the eu and it 's member states during it 's recent history . 
  i 'm not trying to attack your opinions here ( well , obviously i am but it 's not vindictive ) this is just reality . 
   same with turkey or middle east . 
  if you are a greek who does n't see turkey or the middle east as a threat you are massively , *** massively *** unrepresentative of your countrymen . 
   is turkey or the me a threat to spain or france ? 
  i think you 've narrowed down europe to `` northern europe '' i think you 're attempting to drag nationality into this on a truly odious level . 
  more so , you 're doing it in a bizarre fashion by stating that turkey is not a threat to greece ( when your countrymen disagree with you ) and is not to france or spain but is somehow therefore solely viewed as a threat to `` northern europe . '', 
  your logic does n't check out . 
   then ignoring the 8 % of the uk is n't a problem and snp can stop talking about it . 
  of course they should n't . 
  they 're the scottish government and scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain . 
   the uk made a decision , not the scots , english , welsh , or irish . 
  actually , the scots , english , welsh and * northern * irish * did * make a decision completely independent of each other . 
  england and wales voted to leave , and scotland and northern ireland voted to stay . 
  the scottish and northern irish parliaments are now in the process of pursuing the interests of their countries . 
   if snp wants to complain they are n't listened to in the uk they should pay attention to their minority opinions in scotland . 
  they are of course , however they are representing the wishes of the scottish people who voted - much more forcefully - to remain in the eu than british people voted to leave , and are therefore pursuing those wishes , and quite admirably so . 
  if you did n't want this course of action , you should have voted more smartly than you did . 
  this is the problem with brexit 's manufactured boogiemen and xenophobic campaign mores . 
  vote sensibly or face the fallout . 
  believing in something and voting for it is how it becomes reality . 
  you do n't believe external threats exist ? 
  russia , the us , turkey and the middle east , china , india - any large body with interests contrary to ours is a threat on some level . 
  to stand together against them is not just sensible , it 's survivalism . 
  they 're the scottish government . 
  they represent the scottish people , not the british people . 
  westminster does that , of course it is n't considering the good of the union either , so there 's that . 
  no to what ? 
  she 's the leader of the scottish government . 
  scottish voters voted overwhelmingly to remain . 
  thoughts a ) a rising tide raises all ships b ) there will always be competing interests c ) the dominance of germany is overstated , and well particularly see that if we get a strong french leader . 
  d ) the dominance of germany will be eroded over time thanks to point b ) under the fairly safe presumption that italy and the like get their shit together and join the big 2/3 e ) i 'd much much much much rather have liberal , skillful , fiscally responsible , moral and anti-militaristic germany setting the tone for policy decisions than any contemporary alternates like the tory party , fg/ff , pis or whoever greece have . 
  f ) and thus the above will deter gangsters like putin and downright bad people like trump from attempting to screw europe over . 
  considerably more scottish people voted to remain than british people voted to leave , yet you seem fine with letting westminster ignore the 48 % . 
  i would advise you do the same with scotland 's 36 % . 
  what 's the relevance of this ? 
  he 's being intentionally disingenuous . 
  5 % of scottish voters did not vote to remain , 62 % did . 
  central government . 
  it looks alright . 
  definitely one of those `` lets make an artsy statement that finndacool ca n't understand '' type deadlies . 
  no , they 'll come from yours as you well know , and there 's nothing you can do about it . 
  and that 's as it should be . 
  english people seem to be resoundingly bad at handling british politics . 
  good fucking grief . 
  5 % of voters did not vote to remain , 48 % of voters voted to remain . 
  because the scottish government represent the scottish people and the scottish people voted resoundingly to remain . 
  what are either of you even saying ? 
  turns out people are stupid , although both renzi and cameron had massive problems . 
  and globally you 've got people like trump and duterte , this is n't just a european thing . 
  although hopefully this will caution people to stop using a body they benefit from as a scapegoat for local politics . 
  presumably he meant hawks but it 's more fun to imagine he just hates atlanta . 
  well the uk has recently stated its desire to become singapore . 
  i absolutely agree with him that more consolidation and cooperation is the answer to improving quality of life and competitiveness . 
  and yes , giving up some sovereignty too . 
  the slavic ideal crashing into human reality . 
  your country 's england . 
  i ca n't see how irish nationalists cut off a piece of it . 
  do you mean liverpool ? 
  man i tried hard to work that extra syllable in there , i really did , but nothing sounded right . 
   a chance to participate in a vote where what they voted for would actually happen they always have this . 
  this year they were promised contradictory statements from 350 million back to the nhs to the switzerland option to the norway option to the canada option to full doors closed on immigrants , and do n't pretend they were n't . 
  everything was waved under their noses just as it is every election . 
   neither would nato . 
  nato would never instigate a war with nato with nato troops in the region ? 
   currently , the us is a net positive trading partner for europe with a surplus of over $ 100 billion dollars . 
  the eu has a trade deficit with china of over $ 100 billion dollars . 
  this was the clumsiest attempt at a false equivalency i 've seen in a while . 
  the us has a trade deficit with china of ** $ 366 billion dollars , ** over triple what the european union 's is . 
  he 's probably pointing out that you listed entirely british marques which are actually no longer british . 
  bentley and rolls royce are owned by volkswagen and jaguar and range rover are indian . 
  aston martin , lamborghini , bugatti , alfa romeo , koenigsegg , some other flowery marques ... 
  exactly this strategy worked against the bush administration . 
  i get it , but it seems a bit unfair to the boyars . 
   that would make russia openly deploy their troops in east ukraine to `` peacekeep '' the population from `` nato agression '' . 
  an overt invasion in ukraine would be an open declaration of war , and russia would never instigate that with western troops in the region . 
   those are attempts to breake russia - turkey relations . 
  well yeah , by erdogan . 
  dude is doing broadly the same thing putin is doing . 
  i 've still no idea what you 're talking about so indulge me . 
   a legacy of `` friendship '' with the west in 90s . 
  what friendship ? 
  i honestly do n't understand what you 're saying here . 
  i do n't recall any period where russia was friendly with it 's neighbours .
