i feel bad for the perception people seem to have of sweden and wwii . 
  it 's awfully inaccurate and i 've even met swedes who genuinely seem to believe it . 
  i do n't know how it 's taught in school for you lot , but there 's just so much wrongful myths circulating . 
  if anything sweden deserved credit for standing up against the nazis ' demands for the sake of neutrality , the nazis could 've with relative ease done a norway 2.0 to sweden from everything i 've read . 
  it 's things like the comic i was linked below . 
  oversimplified and are often plain wrong . 
  and i do n't know if people are unable to or just do n't want to undertand what ` neutrality ' means . 
  it means not picking sides . 
  it 's not about `` pick the winning side '' , it 's `` pick no side '' . 
  and sweden did n't declare either side as right or wrong , and treated them both like the did before . 
  but because the allies won anyone as much as talking to the axis are seen as evil i suppose . 
  it seems you never win by being neutral in the middle of the losing sides territory , but switzerland does n't get the same treatment in my experience . 
  it 's a nice comic , but horrifically inaccurate . 
  yes , sweden traded iron and other things with nazi germany . 
  germany were , and to this day still is , sweden 's largest export partner . 
  sweden also traded with the allies . 
  * because it was neutral * , it did n't pick sides !, 
  sweden did not allow the nazis to transport * any * military personnel or materials on its railways until * after * norway was already occupied and was a part of `` their '' territory . 
  this despite the fact that the nazis tried to bribe and threatened to invade them . 
  the only german military personel who , in hindsight , were found to have gone on swedish railways were recon soldiers * in the disguise of red cross workers * . 
  sweden had to let those through for humanitarian reasons and there was no indication of them being soldiers . 
  the only reason we know they were is because we now got nazi diaries . 
  sweden had german communications wiretapped and * warned norway of an impending invasion * . 
  this was arguably the most significant breach of neutrality sweden did , and as you can see , it was * against the nazis * , not for them . 
  as for denmark , sweden made exceptions and allowed virtually all of denmark 's jewish refugees to seek refuge . 
  this despite , again , threats from the nazis . 
  nazi germany could 've easily gone through with it and invaded sweden . 
  sweden honestly deserves credit for not breaking its neutrality , because it had nothing to stop the nazis and would 've ended exactly like norway . 
  in the context of war `` collaborate '' means :  cooperate traitorously with an enemy . 
  ( [ oxford ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/collaborate ) )  * disapproving * -- to work with an enemy who has taken control of your own country : ( [ cambridge ] ( http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/collaborate ) )  to cooperate with or willingly assist an enemy of one 's country and especially an occupying force ( [ merriam-webster ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collaborate ) ) it 's just not something sweden did . 
  sweden itself did n't have enemies since they were neutral , and even from an allied perspective ( where the nazis would be enemies ) sweden just did n't . 
  and whether sweden , as a country , was * cooperating * we 're going to have to agree to disagree on . 
  sure , swedish volunteers helped in finland , but * sweden itself * refused to take a stance , much to say aland 's dismay . 
  prior to wwii , aland was mostly pro-sweden , after they identified more with finnish simply due to the fact that sweden refused to take a stance . 
  and in terms of breaking neutrality regarding the war , the only thing a swedish really did that could be warranted as such , was warning norway about an impending invasion that sweden knew of from wiretapping nazi communication . 
  that 's the opposite of working with the nazis . 
  so i do find it almost insulting to imply sweden was collaborating with the nazis , they simply did n't . 
  * as a country * , sweden really did n't even cooperate in war efforts , they most certainly did n't collaborate . 
  sweden was neutral . 
  sweden was not `` collaborating '' , it was neutral . 
  being neutral does n't mean `` let 's stop everything with our largest trade parter because they 're the bad guy '' . 
  it means not recognizing either side as the bad guy . 
  if the nazis would 've won , people would say the exact opposite about sweden considering how they `` helped '' the allies . 
  they were threatened and bribed by the nazis to do a whole bunch of things which they refused for the sake of neutrality , despite the fact they easily could 've been steamrolled . 
  saying they were collaborating is ignorant and honestly quite insulting to sweden and their neutrality . 
  why would i do that ? 
  i 've got no intention to offend people . 
  i was just trying to objectively respond to your :   that said , i do n't see the point of keeping to use that name since ireland obviously do n't like it . 
   now why would that be do you think ? 
  is it prehaps because they 're not british per chance ? 
  i never said that . 
  where would you wager my position lies when i say stuff like `` i do n't see the point of keeping to use that name since ireland obviously do n't like it '' and `` let 's respect peoples wishes '' ... ? 
  but that does n't prevent me from looking at things objectively . 
  of course it may have leave poor connotations . 
  i 'm just making the argument of how ireland indeed can be called `` british '' . 
  it can . 
  and , no , an irishman is no less irish for that . 
  just like an irishman is no less irish for also being european . 
  and scandinavia can have political connotations too . 
  as it relates to the north germanic cultural sphere sweden , norway , and denmark share , it * could * have negative connotation among the native finno-ugric peoples . 
  it all depends on bias and interpretation . 
  likewise `` british isles '' is n't an inherently political term either , it can also just be used as a geographical descriptor . 
  but , yes , it is riddled with political connotations in ireland . 
  that 's why i 'm not saying it should be used , on the contrary i said `` let 's respect peoples wishes '' . 
  what did you think i meant by that ? 
  when you hear `` british '' , you seem to think of `` united kingdom - * ish * '' , but that 's not what the ` british ' in ` british isles ' means . 
  it 's just like `` american '' , just because you may think of someone from the us , does n't mean the term does n't also apply to all of the americas . 
  it 's the same with british . 
  no , ireland is n't `` uk * ish * '' , but it is related to britannia , hence `` british '' . 
  words ' meanings extends . 
  a norwegian is scandinavian , despite never having visited scania . 
  a portuguese is iberian , without having sailed the ebro . 
  a korean would be asian , despite not having any relation to the anatolian peninsula . 
  a scot is british , despite not being a descendant of the ancient britons . 
  but , as said , let 's respect peoples wishes . 
  people clearly interpret ` british ' as `` uk * ish * '' , even if that 's not what 's meant by it . 
  the issue is that it is an archipelago , but there is n't a good name for it . 
  ` britain and ireland ' , does n't feel very inclusive for all the smaller islands . 
  maybe ` anglo-celtic isles ' or something ? 
  `` scandinavia '' comes from ` scania ' ( the region in the southernmost present day sweden ) and since that region was all the romans knew of the north , everything beyond it was also referred to as `` scandinavia '' . 
  similarly britannia was the roman region in what we now call england , and was eventually used for everything beyond ( incl . 
  ireland ) . 
  it was named after the celtic people living there , the brittons . 
  scotland was as little `` british '' as ireland originally , it was pictish if anything . 
  `` iberian '' comes from the river ebro , which is entirely in spain . 
  it 'd be like calling the islands `` thamesian isles '' , which i doubt would be appreciated much either . 
  the ` british ' in ` british isles ' does n't refer to `` the united kingdom of britain and northern ireland '' , it refers to something relating to britannia , which the isles are . 
  just like scandinavia is something relating to scania and the iberian peninsula is something relating to ebro . 
  that said , i do n't see the point of keeping to use that name since ireland obviously do n't like it . 
  i 'm just saying the comparison to iberia and scandinavia are bad , because both those names literally originated in the exact same manner as the `` british isles '' . 
  it 's only your interpretation that 's different . 
  on the contrary was helping finland one of reasons they contemplated breaking neutrality . 
  the principle of neutrality was born long before . 
   i would n't really go with the term `` pick '' , since to pick something you need to have actually options . 
  yeah , i agree . 
  i struggled with the right word choice there . 
  i just meant after finland had officially ended up allied with the nazis ... that also sounds weird . 
  i do n't know , i hope you still know what i mean . 
  neutral means not picking a side . 
  rationing trade would mean picking a side and thus breaking neutrality .
