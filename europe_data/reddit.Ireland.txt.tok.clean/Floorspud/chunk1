bathroom/restroom - toilet if it 's anything like canada they use washroom instead and some people take a second when i say bathroom . 
  all they have to say is something like `` we believe these new laws offer a similar level of protection to the environment and consumers '' which may or may not be true . 
  probably going to watch the wind that shakes the barley and/or michael collins . 
  also drink . 
  as long as it 's not windy going out in -20 is n't bad if you 're dressed properly . 
  i actually rather be out when it 's that cold with a sunny day and blue sky than miserable rain and grey sky all the time . 
  source : moved from ireland to canada . 
  currently living in canada and i 'd love to visit your country . 
  i have a wife who would be very , irrationally , nervous about some of the negative stereotypes of mexico , gangs and stuff like zika etc. 
  also would n't be very good with the language . 
  where would you recommend ? 
  poor attempt member of / r/downvotetrolling . 
  looks like most of you woke up . 
  the flag was in tatters for ages after the void shite . 
  fair play, 
  we should have just stuck with the ford model t. 
  did n't expect australia to have that much . 
  any particular reason ? 
  [ higher resolution here . 
  the british isles is a geographical term . 
  it has nothing to do with being owned or part of britain . 
  your map shows ireland as having a monarchy when it does n't . 
  northern ireland has as part of the uk . 
  also just fyi neither of our governments and certainly not many of the people of ireland would ever refer to it as the british isles since that might imply ireland being some part of britain . 
  ireland does n't have a monarchy . 
  jaysus , and people complained about our spire . 
  probably in all those sharia no-go zones they talk about on fox news . 
   and the british isles was not a political term so you ca n't see that , it makes the argument pointless . 
  i hear prussia is lovely this time of year . 
   dee posited a formal claim to north america on the back of a map drawn in 1577 -- 80 ; [ 56 ] he noted circa 1494 mr robert thorn his father , and mr eliot of bristow , discovered newfound land . 
  [ 57 ] in his title royal of 1580 , he invented the claim that madog ab owain gwynedd had discovered america , with the intention of ensuring that england 's claim to the new world was stronger than that of spain . 
  [ 58 ] he further asserted that brutus of britain and king arthur as well as madog had conquered lands in the americas and therefore their heir elizabeth i of england had a priority claim there . 
  [ 59 ] [ 60 ] the guy sure sounds like a reliable source for non-political geographic naming . 
  & nbsp ;  yugoslavia was always a political term . 
  exactly . 
   all dee did was translate the common term into the vernacular . 
  specifically for political purposes . 
  the greeks can call things what they like 1000 's of years ago . 
  it 's no longer a useful geographical term due to it being inaccurate . 
  ireland is no longer under british rule so it is not a british isle . 
  times change , countries change . 
  are you going to argue for the continued use of yugoslavia too since it was once written down like that in a geography book ? 
  going by your thinking we should still use yugoslavia . 
  early explorers made up many names for places . 
  it was recorded but was n't in common usage at all until the 16th and 17th century . 
  so by your definition , british isles is also not useful since isle of man is technically a crown dependency . 
  saying it 's cos britain is bigger therefore they get to pick the name of a group of territories they 're near is just as made up . 
  all names are made up , some are more accurate than others and some have political motivations . 
  lets group these countries and territories together and call them british because ... what ? 
  what 's the point ? 
  they 're near each other and that one 's the biggest one !, 
  again look up the history of when and how the term was introduced . 
   it 's called the british isles after the largest island it 's called the british isles because proponents of the expansion of the british empire and colonialism called it that to further their agenda . 
  you can look up the history of the likes of john dee and how the term came to be commonly used to see that clearly . 
  it 's a completely useless geographical term because it 's inaccurate and inherently political . 
  it 's also not officially recognised by either government . 
  the holy roman empire was once a useful geographical term i 'm sure , times change . 
   this whole debate is about as useful as claiming using ireland , as you do might i add , in relation to the roi is trying to include northern ireland . 
  it just fucking is n't . 
  that 's accurate though is n't it ? 
  roi is n't claiming any of ni . 
  the island is called ireland . 
  the two states are republic of ireland and northern ireland . 
  seems fairly intuitive , the northern part of the island of ireland that 's a separate state is called northern ireland . 
  it 's an accurate term politically and geographically so i do n't see how this helps your point . 
  ever thought how the people belonging to the island for 1000 's of years would like to name their part ? 
  or is just using the colonial british term given to us is good enough and we should be happy to accept it . 
  north atlantic archipelago , anglo-celtic islands , british & irish isles , britain & ireland ... not like it 's often useful to group them into one name anyway . 
  calling it triggering trying to reduce it to it being the fault of over sensitiveness is a bit oversimplifying . 
  they can call it that if they like , but it 's not an official term by their government and also inaccurate so it 's kind of pointless . 
  the ancient greek term that was n't in common use for over 1000 years then reintroduced in an effort to promote british colonialism . 
  i 'm sure there are many things the ancient greeks had names for that have changed over the years . 
  suppose it 's too much to ask what the indigenous people who have been on the island for 1000 's of years what they 'd like to call it ? 
  we have to go with what the colonial british decided to call it instead . 
  sorry the facts do n't line up with your opinion . 
  look up john dee and his quest for promoting british expansion . 
   [ his 1576 general and rare memorials pertayning to the perfect arte of navigation was the first volume in an unfinished series planned to advocate the rise of imperial expansion . \\ [ 49 \\ ] in the highly symbolic frontispiece , dee included a figure of britannia kneeling by the shore beseeching elizabeth i , to protect her empire by strengthening her navy . \\ [ 50 \\ ] dee used geoffrey 's inclusion of ireland in arthur 's imperial conquests to argue that arthur had established a ` british empire ' abroad . \\ [ 51 \\ ] he further argued that england exploit new lands through colonisation and that this vision could become reality through maritime supremacy . \\ [ 52 \\ ] \\ [ 53 \\ ] dee has been credited with the coining of the term british empire , \\ [ 54 \\ ] however , humphrey llwyd has also been credited with the first use of the term in his commentarioli britannicae descriptionis fragmentum , published eight years earlier in 1568 . \\ [ 55 \\ ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_dee#advocacy_of_english_expansion ), 
   [ the term `` british isles '' entered the english language in the 16th century to refer to great britain , ireland and the surrounding islands ; it was introduced in elizabethan times as a political term \\ [ 79 \\ ] and did not enter common usage until the first half of the 19th century \\ [ 80 \\ ] and , in general , the modern notion of `` britishness '' evolved after the 1707 act of union . \\ [ 81 \\ ] while it is probably the most common term for the islands , this use is not universally accepted and is generally rejected in ireland . \\ [ 10 \\ ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_isles_naming_dispute ), 
  it fell out of use for over 1000 years and was then reintroduced specifically with political motivations by british writers . 
  it 's not an officially recognised term by either government , eu or the un and the name is inaccurate so it 's completely pointless . 
  using that term makes it political . 
  these posts are getting a bit spammy now . 
  there 's already a thread about charles trevelyan and scumbagness against ireland you could discuss it there . 
  the government gets little to no money from that oil and gas . 
  there were terrible deals made by corrupt politicians giving away royalties and reducing the taxes to the oil companies on top of generous tax write-offs that reduce the revenue further . 
  we 're being robbed . 
  not sure that 's so true anymore . 
  they shut down kat and extratorrent recently and they have n't really recovered or been replaced . 
  piratebay is still up and some clone of kat is up but it 's a shell of what it was and there are a few other places but they 're nowhere near as organised with a community rating and commenting on torrents . 
  tee-shock . 
  it 's the equivalent of prime minister and literally translates to something like leader or chieftain . 
  you usually do n't get full size pints in canada either . 
  some places even use this as marketing for their special deals like `` $ 5 pints ! '', 
  then give you a 16oz . 
  it also depends on what type of visa you came on . 
  i got my canadian pr last year , we applied before the new points system came in and it was pretty easy as long as you 're working . 
  we came on an open work permit so it does n't require company sponsorship and that 's the more common one . 
  have a couple of friends who also got pr recently on the new system and while it was harder it still was n't too bad if at least one in the couple has a decent job . 
  i 'd need to cleanse my toxins after eating that . 
  or irish , australian , south african , canadian , new zealand ...
