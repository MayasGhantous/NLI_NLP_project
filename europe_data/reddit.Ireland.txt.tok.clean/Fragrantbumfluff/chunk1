  it 's just we share so little in common culturally . 
  if you want a strong eu that 's what you need : cultural ties , but the eu is so diverse and each nation has existed for thousands of years before the eu , sharing borders yet still keeping their own separate identities . 
  article 29 , section 4 , subsection 9 \u00b0 of the constitution of ireland : the state shall not adopt a decision taken by the european council to establish a common defence pursuant to article 42 of the treaty on european union where that common defence would include the state . 
  ireland is neutral . 
  we do n't take sides and we do n't fight in wars . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_neutrality anything that changes that position will be met with total resistance . 
  exactly . 
  the eu gives us funding and acts as higher authority , if we have need of one ( european supreme court ) but apart from that i 've no loyalty to the eu at all . 
  makes sense . 
  it 's basically what the irish did when we went to america . 
  how do you get a one handed englishman out of a tree ? 
  wave at him . 
  did n't realise latvians were mad to get to ireland . 
  why 's that ? 
  there 's quite a lot of you here , i like your sense of humor . 
  it 's the exact opposite of the irish humor , which is hilarious to us . 
  mini bubble . 
  house prices in dublin and other cities are huge . 
  there 's a huge housing shortage in the cities . 
  and i mean huge , and the goverment is doing little to nothing about it it will take years to build new houses , meanwhile rents are astronomical and will be for a long time .

  a badger . 
  seriously a pissed of badger with its claws will mess you up . 
  a buck or stag during mating season . 
  the cow . 
  ireland being such a farming country , many people have been killed by being trampled or charged by a herd or a lone bull . 
  more like irish botswana . 
  seriously , there 's a village somewhere in botswana holding a sponsored run for the poor children of carlow . 
  just so they shut the fuck up about ` mayo 4 sam ' for a bit, 
  grand instead of the nhs we 'll take 2 bags of tayto . 
  smoky bacon flavour please ... 
  i 'll admit that version is better than the one down south, 
  ah now , i did n't say that . 
  ah here , potato bread is the bomb . 
  lovely and warm with a good bit of butter . 
  grand so . 
  snickers , taytos and the nhs , right they 're on the list . 
  i 'll pass a copy onto the queen and another for enda kenny . 
  should be all sorted by september . 
  snickers , tayto ... what 's the third ? 
  no idea . 
  but we have to get the american cousins to sneak them through customs when they 're coming over . 
  of course i live close to the border with northern ireland so i have easy access . 
  it 's difficult for those in the remote parts of ireland unable to access their favourite nut and caramel packed snack . 
  alright mate . 
  can i get tres pints of stella ? 
  fanks mate , sorry i meant ` grassy-arse ' , as you spaniards would say . 
  it would be so much easier as you 'd probably have an extra pair of legs to ski with . 
  i 'm not sure you understand how that would play out . 
  what you 're suggesting is just [ mad !,

   because nukes they 're not called a deterrent for nothing . 
  i wish he was n't , so we could have the joy of burying him alive .

  no one cares , i bet even the judges were like ` it 's my cd , i 'll do what i want with it . ', 
  `` just get it to ireland , they 'll know what do to with it there . '', 
  http://youtu.be/by3fphmhwmo brilliant bit of observation !, 
  welsh 2 . 
  cornish 6 . 
  my mother tongue gaelig i can understand 6 perfectly . 
  some of 4 ... and i recognise the rhythm of 2 to be similar to how i and other irish speakers sound , but i do n't understand what 's being said . 
  all 3 sound similar to me . 
  1 , 3 , 5 are completely alien sounding to me . 
  til rory mcilroy narrates youtube videos on irish history . 
  we do n't . 
  it 's confusing to explain i suppose but here goes t\u00e1 ( translated as yes on the ballot paper ) in this context means ' i approve ' not simply ` yes ' . 
  also n\u00edl in this context means ' i do not approve ' more so that ` no ' we generally do n't say yes or no in irish . 
  you use the the question to answer . 
  did you go home last night ? 
  answer : i did n't or i did , not yes or no . 
  the magdalene sisters, 
  what 's the difference between ` just about nothing ' and ` nothing ' ? 
  well ` nothing ' is nothing , it 's 0 , you ca n't change that , you ca n't have a little bit of nothing or less that nothing . 
  the same way you ca n't be a * little bit * pregnant . 
  it 's a binary state . 
  it either is or it is n't . 
  ` just about nothing ' is not actually nothing . 
  it 's more than nothing , it 's * nearly * nothing , but it 's not nothing so therefore it 's something . 
  so your comment did add something to the discussion . 
  it just was n't funny . 
  i generally do n't bother with trolls , but you sound too idiotic to ignore !, 
  the english finally buggered off . 
  it only took the best part of 800 years . 
  seeing as it 's paddy 's day tomorrow and i 'm just about to go on the beer , here some traditional irish songs that i 'm sure will be heard long into the wee hours of tomorrow morning . 
  the last two links , are n't links to the traditional performances but the voices are fantastic so i included them for a bit more of a mix . 
  english lyrics and meaning in most links .
