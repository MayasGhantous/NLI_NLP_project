  but no ireland wo n't ever join the uk , you have no understanding on the irish mindset when it comes to this . 
  we 're a different culture entirely , no sane irish person would allow that to happen . 
  irishness is hard to define but i 'm sure many people would agree that : to be irish is essentially to not be english . 
  a lot of americans think similarly . 
  i do n't hear it personally . 
  the old glow in the dark . 
  that would never happen . 
  the fact you keep suggesting it is n't going to make it sound better . 
  ireland will never join the uk . 
  we fought for nearly a millennium to get out of it . 
  if ever faced with the choice of joining the uk or else ... i 'd imagine we 'd rather burn the place to the ground that join up with yourselfs . 
  to hell or to connaught . 
  apparently it 's 1 . 
  i 'd imagine the figure would be closer to .001 % in all honesty . 
  that would be akin to asking mexico to rejoin the united states . 
  anyone who wants to live and work in the uk is able to do it . 
  pack their packs tomorrow and off they go , no questions asked . 
  ca n't irish people vote in elections over there ? 
  same for uk citizens here after a certain length of residency,

  i like you . 
  you can be irish if you want , you 've the right attitude and sense of humour it seems . 
  exchange drunk program ? 
  was this actually a thing ? 
  i 'm dying to visit finland, 
  i 've yet to see that , missed it when it was out . 
  i have it on a hard drive somewhere must give it a look this weekend,

  [ any kind of disguise really ] ( http://www.theirishstore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/800px-traditional-irish-halloween-mask.jpg )  hallowe\u2019en celebrates the ghoulish and ghostly because , in the celtic calendar , it was the time of year when supernatural beings were most likely to roam the earth . 
  at the end of what we call october , the doorways between our world and the spirit world opened a crack , allowing all kinds of creatures to slip through and terrorize humans . 
  the costumes we wear were first intended as a disguise to distract the attention of meddling fairies . 
  if the p\u00faca could not tell who you were , they could not punish you for wrongs committed against them during the year .

  this is a picture of a19th century turnip on display at the museum of country life in ireland [ we used to make them as kids before the pumpkin became popular . 
  ] ( http://www.fsc.gov.im/lib/images/mnh/news/turnip.jpg ) they are much harder to carve as they are not hollow like pumpkins . 
  the smell of burning turnip still reminds me of halloween .

  ... well that bit her in the ass . 
  ca n't say i care . 
  who the fuck likes merkel , president of the united states of europe ? 
  we should point out these are the * only * planes in service . 
  we do n't have a jet, 
  can you two get a room if you want to suck his dick like that, 
  tl : dr : they 're still f * cked !, 
  loved that place . 
  good food , good drink , good people . 
  to live in anyway . 
  the recession really hit it bad, 
  sorry , i really do n't know . 
  and i 'm ashamed of that . 
  i was very surprised . 
  our news does n't tell us this . 
  just shows you home little we know about the continent . 
  i mean if you asked me to place countries on a map of africa ; i know ghana , nigeria , south africa , tanzania , congo and that 's really it . 
  europeans are as ignorant of africa as the stereotypical american is of europe i.e. 
  viewing a whole continent as one country one people . 
  personally , i only know a bit because my friend adopted children from nigeria and we visited tanzania , ghana and s. africa, 
  have a look for yourselves . 
  each red dot is a thermal anomaly i.e. 
  a fire https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/?p=geographic&amp;l=viirs_snpp_correctedreflectance_truecolor,modis_aqua_correctedreflectance_truecolor,modis_terra_correctedreflectance_truecolor,modis_fires_terra,reference_labels ( hidden ) , coastlines & t = 2016-08-10 & v = -12.338179097787018,38.15011857891856 , -5.588179097787018,46.30636857891856 do n't look at africa . 
  africa 's got it bad , it 's on fire, 
  have you seen sky news . 
  it 's the journalistic equivalent of poking a tiger with a stick . 
  they live and breathe for the reaction . 
  they 'll get away with it because the british government wo n't want to embarrass murdoch , who in turn will turn their lives into hell with his dirty tabloid rags, 
  not an expert , never said i was . 
  but ur post was ignorant and just plain untrue . 
  do n't need an expert for that, 
  yeah , i 'm one of those families too numbnuts !, 
  do n't speak about what you do n't know, 
   but religion is still the root cause of the divide and the main reason it persists . 
  this is simply not true . 
  anyone who says otherwise has a very poor grasp of the situation . 
  have you read the rest of the thread ? 
  it 's about nationalism and identity . 
  their extreme views are n't shared by the majority of the population . 
  they do n't like that . 
  even people who are sympathetic to their cause realise that they 're never going to help themselves when they refuse any compromise or invitation to talk . 
  i do n't have figures for this , put a lot of the hardcore loyalists come from disadvantaged areas , would n't have the best education and live in essentially ghettos that act as an echo chamber for their anger . 
  it 's a bad mix all round . 
  i feel for the innocent kids being brought up in such a toxic environment . 
  they 're inheriting their parents prejudices . 
  such attitudes are also seen on the republican side too . 
  i know many friends of mine who inherited their parents and grand parents hatred of anything british . 
  both attitudes are backward af !, 
  and we 've learned from that and moved on . 
  you ca n't compare the political situation now with that of the past . 
  we can and have found peaceful solutions , both sides compromised . 
  some groups did n't ... they 're the dangerous element in all this who wants to see a return to the troubles ? 
  no one !, 
  such is the will of the people . 
  we ca n't let a small minority hold the rest of the country hostage . 
  they are marginalising themselves but are too blind with anger they ca n't see the wood for the trees . 
  who will be the start of the violence ? 
  maybe that should be looked at . 
  nah ... we love scotland r/celticunion http://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2016/07/19/well-take-scotland-too-but-not-wales-fuck-wales-taoiseach-enda-kenny/,
