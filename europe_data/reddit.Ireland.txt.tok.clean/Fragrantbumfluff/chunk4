  that 's the society they live in . 
  they * are * becoming a smaller more concentrated group . 
  society id 's moving on , yet they 're still stuck in the dregs of anger and living in the past . 
  funny how some post offices in antrim and belfast ran out of irish passport application forms after brexit . 
  seems those loyalists are happy to be irish when it suits them . 
  i wonder did ian paisley jr. get his yet ? 
  i hope enda kenny hand delivers it . 
  so someone spelling their name a different way gets them all hot and bothered ? 
  why not have areas that are bilingual ? 
  should n't bother them , it 's not like they are made to speak irish . 
  they should n't be so anti everything . 
  they 're endearing themselves to no-one . 
  they do realise that they live in northern ** ireland ** , there might be some elements of irish culture about the place . 
  their culture seems to be mainly about burning flags and effigies and marching . 
  that 's grand march where you want , make it a good fun family day but do n't antagonize people by marching through areas you know will only cause trouble , and they know it . 
  that 's what they want . 
  we can all live in peace , apart from these kinds of people who like nothing better than to kick up a fuss about nothing . 
  time to come into the light with the rest of the world , lads !, 
  you 're not right , but you 're not wrong with what you said . 
  that 's the whole problem , no one side is right and no one side is wrong . 
  honesty , i wish there was no argument to begin with ... * sigh * ca n't we all just get on with our lives and stop with the old arguments of our ancestors ? 
  we 've shook hands and made peace and slowly but surely life is getting better , let 's keep going !, 
  agreed . 
  do not get the bus tours , as per usual they 're shite !, 
  he 's kind of got a point . 
  are we going to ask norway to apologise for the viking invasions ? 
  he is . 
  but being from ulster and not from northern ireland it annoys me when ulster is used as a synonym for n.ireland . 
  donegal , cavan and monaghan, 
  and germans ca n't even remember 1966 but to the english it 's everything, 
  religion has little to do with it . 
  if it did the two sides would be out debating the importance of mass and the immaculate conception . 
  the only reason you 'll hear of protestant vs catholic is because most of those who identify as british also identify as protestant . 
  those who identify as irish are more likely to be catholic . 
  if you 're an atheist in ireland , that could easily be followed up with : are you a catholic atheist or a protestant atheist ? 
  fella , he does n't even know what he 's chatting about . 
  ignore and he 'll go away, 
  til, 
  are they still there ? 
  are there groups of japanese people in singapore ranting and shouting that singapore is actually part of japan ? 
  and actively encouraging hatred and violence against anyone who does n't agree with their views ? 
  to you it might be a small scale conflict . 
  it 's all relative . 
  you can not compare it to japan in ww2 . 
  japan did n't invade and occupy another country . 
  i 'm not laying blame , just stating the current climate . 
  you 're correct it 's not only on one side . 
  however it 's not equal . 
  this is the side that feels hard done by . 
  so they 're generally more vocal and proactive shall we say . 
  burning of irish flags , hatred of anything irish or even remotely connected to ireland etc. 
  despite the fact that they 're in the island of ireland . 
  there is n't anything comparable on the other side it 's a small but quite vocal and physically aggressive minority, 
  man by the name of david howe http://www.bustle.com/articles/110730-how-are-the-howes-royal-the-suddenly-royal-family-isnt-official-quite-yet had a reality show mad about him caked suddenly royal , it 's on youtube . 
  he thinks he 's descended from the last king of mann . 
  it 's absurd . 
  there 's a video of him confronting locals and they basically tell him to lump it back to the states . 
  that 's the highlands , very low population density so i 'm really confused by this . 
  it 's mostly sheep farmers, 
  is that idiot fat yank still claiming he 's your king ? 
  there 's a very small minority of loyalists who still harbor a lot of hatred and anger . 
  it 's these idiots who 'll destroy the peace for the rest of us . 
  the majority of people just want to put the past behind us and get in with our lives but then brexit happened,

  big aul lumpy head on us .

  [ good old dealz ] ( http://www.dealz.ie/replay-cd-westlife-unbreakable-the-greatest-hits-vol-1 ), 
  norway have managed their resources spectacularly well . 
  every other country should look to them to see how it 's done, 
  george osbourne wo n't be chancellor come tomorrow so he can say whatever he likes it does n't actually matter . 
  but at least with brexit the sterling exchange rate is brilliant . 
  you get a couple of euro off your abortion . 
  i 'm betting those women who got their abortion before brexit are kicking themselves now !, 
  keep the recovery going !, 
  what 's that i hear ? 
  you 're not going to make access to abortion legal here , but you are putting on extra bus services to the airport . 
  nice job , enda !, 
  oh shit we forgot the decimal place it 's actually 2.67 %,

  all the bloody atm gives me are $ 50s, 
  of course , there are no maori on craggy island . 
  yeah we always want to see england defeated in things like football and war . 
  an incredible stupid decision which they and we will be paying for for decades !, 
  it 's the hardline loyalists and their violent ways that make me worried that the road will be a bad one ... 
  i live on the border . 
  this will be very very messy and a lot of old wounds will be cut open again, 
  mostly it 's `` fuck you , england ! '', 
  those stupid stupid english cunts !, 
  no thanks , we do n't want to be in charge . 
  that would ruin all the fun !,

  do the rest of australia hate tasmania ?
