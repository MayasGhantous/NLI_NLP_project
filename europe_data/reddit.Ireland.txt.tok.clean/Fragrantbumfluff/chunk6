  and they say james joyce was ireland 's greatest story teller . 
  he did n't even have pics with his stories !, 
  putin is playing with trump . 
  the whole world can see it apart from trump who just likes his ego flattered and he has no experience whatsoever he 's easily played just look at his twitter . 
  putin sees his chance to twist the knife into america . 
  russia is delighted i 'm sure . 
  china will no doubt run to russia if trump keeps pissing them off . 
  the us needs china more than china needs them . 
  i 'm sure the nsa and the cia are shitting it . 
  trump is the biggest national security threat that america has ever encountered . 
  the next four years are going to be very interesting , if he even makes it that far .

  the internet . 
  2000 = dial up 2016 = fibre wifi, 
  mass , pub , films , food , drink and visiting friends . 
  a lot of people would call around to each other 's house late on christmas eve . 
  sometimes after 9/10pm for a drink and chat, 
  the uk : thanks for pissing off europe more than we did with the bailout !, 
  you 've even knocked greece into 2nd place !, 
  i 'd argue to swap hurling and gaelic though . 
  football more popular in connacht and ulster hurling more popular in munster and leinster, 
  i could n't remember the irish word for fell , but then it just thit m\u00e9 . 
  because scottish gaelic came from the irish language around the 11/12th century . 
  also smashing did n't appear in usage until irish emigration to the uk picked up during the middle 1800s, 
  smithereens bog banshee brogue galore hooligan lough and of course whiskey also when the english say ` smashing ' as in something is good , it comes from the irish ` is maith sin ' ( pronounced is-my-shin ) which means ` that is good ' the english heard the irish speaking irish and could n't understand what we said but they thought it sounded like the english word ` smashing ' . 
  and now the english have a smashing good time with it,

  [ yes a fishmonger is like a butcher but just for seafood . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/fishmonger ) here they 'll often set up a van in every town and large village to sell fresh fish from the back of it like [ this ] ( http://s0.geograph.org.uk/geophotos/01/07/53/1075354_4b29efb8.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.barnardsgreenshopping.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/max-grisby-fish1.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://mineheadfarmersmarket.co.uk/fish.jpg ) they might often have their own shop or share one with a butcher . 
  sound pretty normal to me . 
  usually you need a $ 1 or $ 2 coin to get a trolley . 
  i 've never seen a supermarket with a fish or lobster than tank lol maybe in the pet shop but most large supermarkets would have a deli , butcher , fish monger and maybe a small bakery . 
  lidl ( aldi 's main competitor ) have bakeries in all their shops . 
  aldi in the past 5 years have introduced a lot of branded products to compete with the mainstream supermarkets . 
  aldi really is n't a discount or fringe supermarket here ( ireland ) anymore . 
  their food is generally of better quality and more locally sourced than the bigger supermarkets . 
  most places do n't have baggers ... 
  i have n't seen a bagger in 20 years . 
  the checkout assistant might help you out you have a large shop but most people prefer to do it their own way to stop things getting smushed or crushed edit : there are two aldi stores [ aldi sud and aldi nord ] ( https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-08/10/4/campaign_images/webdr04/ist-aldi-nord-oder-aldi-sud-besser-2-13977-1439194401-5_dblbig.jpg ) we have [ aldi sud ] ( http://www.dw.com/image/16724206_401.png ) most continental european countries have aldi nord , sud is generally a step up from the other aldi ... do n't ask me why but they have different products and brands .

  whoooosh, 
  are you out of your volcan mind ? 
  exactly . 
  as long as i do n't miss a mortgage payment twice then nothing will happen . 
  we did n't have good credit scores only blips out you 've missed a few payments , which * might * make someone think twice before agreeing to loan to you, 
  i have a mortgage and a car loan and i 've no idea what a credit score is . 
  you americans really get the raw end if the deal when it comes to financial matters . 
  in fact i cancelled my credit card and stick with my debit card , that way i do n't spend what i do n't have, 
  also my favorite irish word is the word for jellyfish : smugairle r\u00f3in which translates as ` seal snot ' barn owl -- scr\u00e9ach\u00f3g reilige -- graveyard screecher wolf -- mac t\u00edre -- son of the land more here : http://greennews.ie/seal-snot-gods-little-cow-ten-surprising-irish-names-for-wildlife/, 
  i 'd love 13 holidays . 
  there 's desperate need for one between january and paddy 's day . 
  darkest and most depressing time of year , be nice to have something to look forward to . 
  be nice to have one to go christmas shopping and a spare movable one or two for when the fecking sun shines twice a year . 
  michael d higgins birthday should definitely get one . 
  legend !, 
  we should have some sort of presidents day . 
  the stuff with 1916 this year was great craic , made the whole country feel great !, 
  it 's generally called the halloween bank holiday as it normally falls within a a few days of it . 
  same for may . 
  they might not exactly fall on halloween or may day but that 's the reason we have them . 
  but i 've no idea where yer man pulled the 13 from , his arse probably !, 
  bollocks !, 
  we only have 9 bank holidays . 
  where are you getting 13 out of ? 
  1 new year 's day 2 paddy 's day 3 easter monday 4 may day 5 june bank holiday 6 august bank holiday 7 halloween 8 christmas and stephen 's day https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/public-holidays-europe.jpg,

  irish songs : we have tonnes . 
  the national anthem [ amhrain na bhfiann the warriors chant/cry ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv7lgmgfovm ) enya is probably the most well know international singer to have songs in irish [ o\u00edche chi\u00fain ( silent night ) ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=medg9eyfj_4 ) at least you all know that one in your own languages a traditional irish song everyone knows [ trasna na dtonnta ( across the waves ) ] ( https://youtu.be/bchykwvxay0 ) but i 'm going to stick up for my gaelic cousins and nominate a scots song . 
  julie fowlis is a beautiful scottish singer . 
  i only discovered her a year ago . 
  but i really love this song : [ tha mo ghaol air aird a chuain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj67q0vkte ), 
  i love a good paddy irishman , paddy englishman and paddy scotsman joke  paddy englishman , paddy irishman and paddy scotsman were sitting in a bar , drinking , and discussing how stupid their wives were . 
   paddy englishman says :  `` i tell you , my wife is so stupid . 
  last week she went to the supermarket and bought 300 quids worth of meat because it was on sale , and we do n't even have a fridge to keep it in ! '', 
   paddy scotsman agrees that she sounds pretty thick , but says his wife is thicker :  `` just last week , she went out and spent # 17,000 on a new car , and she does n't even know how to drive ! '', 
   paddy irishman nods wisely , and agrees that these two women sound like they both walked through the stupid forest and got hit by every branch . 
  however , he still thinks his wife is dumber :  `` ah , it kills me every time i think of it , '' he chuckles . 
  `` my wife recently left to go on a trip to greece . 
  i watched her packing her bag , and she must have put about 100 condoms in there and she does n't even have a cock ! '', 
  another  an irish man , an english man , a scots man and a welsh man were all on an airplane together when one of the engines fails . 
   the pilot explains the situation to the all of the passengers . 
  he tells them if someone does n't jump out they will all be dead . 
   he asks who is prepared to die for the greater good , adding that they will be remembered as a hero forever . 
   the brave scots man says ` ok then , i will do this for the glory of my country ' and jumps out . 
   the pilot turns around and tells the remaining passengers that the plane is still going down and someone else must do the right thing . 
   the welsh man tells every one that as he is the oldest out of all the passengers , he will take the plunge , so he jumps out . 
   again the pilot turns around and says , its helping but we need 1 more to jump for the rest of the passengers to survive . 
   so the irish man says ` well i hoped it would n't come to this , but i will do this for the greater good and for the glory of my country . 
  so he grabs the english man and throws him out the door . 
  sure one more  paddy englishman , paddy irishman and paddy scotsman all die on christmas eve .
