  baffled thais ca n't stop talking about it , thinking no one else speaks thai . 
  guide appears . 
  `` good morning . 
  my name is waranat . 
  my nickname is lucky . 
  today we will go to koh hey , then stop and have some lunch and some free coke ... '' `` i want a coke . 
  my wife also '' the russian man is standing , arm outstretched , indicating that he wants a coke already . 
  thai customer service being what it is , lucky obliges . 
  he 'd rather an extra 10 baht for coke costs than an angry farang russ-ee-ah . 
  russian wife reaches into handbag and produces a large flask . 
  smell from flask somehow overpowers the smell of the long tail boat 's dirty emissions . 
  russians pour cokes into flask . 
  their faces flush red , and they begin readying for snorkeling , rifling through the gear . 
  it is 10.10 am . 
  we are not even out of sight of ao nang pier yet . 
  sundown . 
  enjoying a cold windhoek under a tree . 
  sitting with an aussie and a swiss woman . 
  along comes formidable stout woman , shining a torch into our tree . 
  myself and the aussie exchange puzzled glances . 
  the aussie starts , you know how they are . 
  `` found what you 're looking for ? '', 
  he asks . 
  `` does it look like i have ? '', 
  russian . 
  here we go . 
  `` well , i do n't know what you are looking for ! '', 
  he responds . 
  `` camel on '' more exchanged glances . 
  i decide i might figure it out if i say it aloud . 
  `` camel on ... 
  `` yes . '', 
  that russian charm . 
  i decide to be helpful . 
  `` well , i heard some squawking over in those bushes , but i think it was a gecko . '', 
  `` gecko does not squeak ! '', 
  `` no , not squeak , squawk . 
  like a parrot . '', 
  `` no lizard has a high pitched call '' `` not high pitched . 
  low . 
  like , er ... '' i do it . 
  i squawk for this tartar nut bag . '', 
  i know what gecko sound like . 
  is not gecko '' oh god . 
  `` i had one live under my fridge , i know what a gecko sounds like . '', 
  she storms off . 
  aussie is baffled . 
  swiss woman ( the canadians of europe ) is taken aback . 
  i am laughing , because it 's been a while since i met a russian and had forgotten what they 're like . 
  suddenly , she 's back . 
  she marches toward me . 
  right to my face . 
  she thrusts her clasped hands towards my eyes . 
  `` this is gecko . 
  no squeak . 
  is female . 
  only male gecko make noise . '', 
  she turns , striding off , tossing the probably quite confused little lizard aside like a cigarette butt . 
  `` well , '' i said , `` i helped her find a gecko . 
  good deed done '' . 
  [ stupid \\ [ \u02c8stju\u02d0p\u026ad \\ ] adj 1 . lacking in common sense , perception , or normal intelligence 2 . 
  \\ ( usually postpositive \\ ) stunned , dazed , or stupefied stupid from lack of sleep 3 . having dull mental responses ; slow-witted 4 . trivial , silly , or frivolous ] ( http://www.thefreedictionary.com/stupid ), 
  hurrah for synonyms . 
  it 's run by the european ( visual ) broadcasting company . 
  perhaps do n't call things stupid when you do n't know very basic things about them ? 
  russians are not european . 
  this is evidenced by * meeting them * . 
  yes we share a history of ollie cromwell killing people in each of our countries . 
  goodbye is also hiberno-english for the english phase `` later , guvnor '' . 
  cork man here , definitely heard slan leat plenty . 
   everything i say is factual , just not very popular with the southern irish it seems . 
  as a corkonian , this is true . 
  anyone else from munster want to confirm ? 
  `` irish '' or irish ? 
  it 's interesting just how accurate this is for history sometimes ... dal riada in ireland and britain , germany extended into northern poland , greeks in ionia , italy divided , island greeks controlling the coastlines , france having looser control over the south, 
  after you 've researched seafaring, 
  something something colonialism something 800 years something oppression . 
  `` jacinta willa cmere timme an open dis bo'ol a cider ? '', 
  it very much depends * which * irish accent it is !, 
  it 's not an official sport , but puc fada the hurling version of road-bowling - trying to get the ball from a to b in as few strokes as possible , is likely an ancestor to golf , or at very least another descendant of the ancestor of golf . 
  join the bloody euro then . 
  that 's the poles, 
  this is laughably untrue . 
  right up there with those american ladies in my area who want to see me tonight , regardless of whether my area is ireland or malaysia !, 
   future common football league etc. 
  have n't uefa come out strongly against stuff like this ? 
  `` super leagues '' or clubs playing in other jurisdictions ? 
  exceptions that already exist like welsh teams in england or derry playing in ireland because of the violence in northern ireland have been exempted , but even 30 years ago it was a struggle to get uefa to agree to let derry move . 
  i was talking more about her genes than about her location . 
  perhaps in croatia . 
  western european women are usually ... less well maintained at that point, 
  finland 's far more quaint , england would be exotic to them . 
  the football team in valkeakoski plays in a very quaint little wooden stadium given to them by the paper factory that makes their town smell like piss, 
  show him some exotic english trees , it 'll distract him . 
  i 'm from ireland , i know about ` diaspora ' . 
  poland is a place , not just a state . 
  actually , i 've re-read your post and it 's not actually wrong . 
  the terminology threw me off a bit . 
  my apologies !, 
  eating far too much coleslaw and being born in poland .
