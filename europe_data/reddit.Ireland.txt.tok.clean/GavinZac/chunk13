  the same is true even in dublin when the beer is made next door . 
  yes , i know that . 
  i live here . 
  a euro for 500ml also cheap compared to ireland , where we certainly do n't have any moral issues with alcohol . 
  a ` european ' pint of draft beer for a euro is not expensive . 
  but germany * is * eastern europe ^ \\* . 
  \\* when judged by musical tastes, 
  oh , i do n't mean to imply that , it 's just that there 's a good bit of value lost from a x-post without the associated discussion . 
  i got it originally as a repost from / r/mapporn and it 's interesting to see the inter-reddit interaction between groups like them and / r/linguistics . 
  / r/europe could have added a lot too !, 
  a cross-post ( x-post ) links directly to the original submission so that the comments are retained . 
  the comments on the original submission are quite interesting . 
  what you 've done is called a * repost * . 
  they are not european . 
  well , the biggest mismanagement is that our fishing stocks are not forcibly protected from non - eu fleets like norway 's and yours . 
  if ireland had our way we 'd declare war . 
  you can be european once you stop raping other european countries ' fish stocks at sea . 
  until then , enjoy being barbarians . 
  what the hell is this guy smoking ? 
  ireland will follow the uk because . . ? 
  it 's pretty moronic alright , since most of those people will then later be cheering for rooney or gerrard or terry or i 'd - name-an-english-arsenal-player-but-i-can ' t for their clubs . 
  me , i 'm a league of ireland fan , so i 'm entitled to . 
  but believe me , when i am booing gerrard or terry it is not because they are english , it is because they are cunts . 
  you 're right , there 's no way i could get rid of a queen 's euro ( queero , for short ) in ireland . 
  all countries get their own design on the back of their own coins , but yes , they work everywhere . 
  ireland is flooded with spanish euro coins every autumn as ( i ) holidayers have come home ( ii ) exchange students arrive, 
  our day will come , like, 
  you forgot [ the people 's republic of cork ] ( http://www.peoplesrepublicofcork.com ) . 
  we 're getting our own passports this year !, 
  uk , then we can let england have liberation . 
  us , the welsh , the scots , the cornish can have the world 's worst cricket team but the world 's best national day party . 
  except to your monarch :p, 
  just a subject then , 
  the official , correct and only word for the english * as gaeilge * ( in irish ) is * sassanach * . 
  the angles do n't get a look in !, 
  `` brits , saxons , huns , prods , jacks , slaves and subjects '' - the british . 
  `` europeans '' - everyone else . 
  46 % mentioned here : http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/unless-facebook-google-blackout-sopa-will-succeed-heres-what-you-can-do/66875 i 've seen the 46 % figure a few times but ca n't find the original data . 
  only 46 % of reddit is american , which is more than any other country , but not a majority . 
  in countries with limited immigration ( e.g. 
  ireland ) , `` immigrant '' is used quite often to refer to anyone of foreign extraction of any form . 
  technically , even ` second-generation immigrant ' is still calling someone an immigrant ; ` second generation ' is a qualifying adjective ' . 
  if i called you an ` unenthusiastic cannibal ' you 'd still be a cannibal . 
  moroccans are 98.7 % muslim . 
  african immigrants are not unknown to turn to islam either . 
  [ northern irish man redacted ( nsfw ) ], 
  i 'm irish , you 're lucky i did n't describe the area in terms of that [ which could feed one cow ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_unusual_units_of_measurement#cow.27s_grass ) . 
  there 's not many of them , but to be fair , such protests often place stress upon the customary 15 feet of personal space that finns are used to . 
  it was usually accompanied by a banging of the desk and mutterings about the damn koreans . 
  `` can we go and see him ? '', 
  `` soon enough '', 
  that and `` spira dal adjee '' were the only things my polish workmates taught me . 
  i taught myself `` jag se mash '' , much to their annoyance . 
  as opposed to when rabid catholics enter their state ? 
  yes , i agree , lots of people tend to be wrong about stuff . 
  ` genocide ' does n't mean ` killing lots of ' . 
  genocide is a specific crime of purposefully attempting to wipe out a ` people ' ( gens ) , an ethnicity . 
  it 's considered worse than mass murder as it is against the basic principles of human coexistence . 
  ` bolsheviks ' did not make a concerted attempt to wipe out the entirety of the slavic people . 
  at what point did people decide ` massacre ' was n't a strong enough word ? 
  refugees are wildlings . 
  assad is the others . 
  hungary are nights watch . 
  serbs are craster and his wives . 
  possibly because sweden already has a significant syrian minority ? 
  here 's an opportunity to teach a little detail of english . 
  you absolutely * may * not walk on the bridge . 
  you very much * can * though . 
  it 's slightly different to have 19 in 90 than 20 in 30 . 
  by a factor of 3 . 
  also , several of them were things like the ending of the absolute monarchy and the changes of government during world war 2 . 
   thailand is a country with 20 coups in the last 30 country . 
  what ? 
  have you had a stroke ? 
  no it has n't . 
  it 's had 19 coups since 1930 . 
  you 're kin to everyone else in europe too . 
  your queen is german ffs, 
  most do not . 
  the countrysides in developed countries are emptying and once the grandparents start dying there will be a severe imbalance . 
  where 's canada ? 
  sorry man i have no problem with you guys . 
   maybe he 's of italian decent ? 
  yeah , his italian is decent alright . 
  hjongoldrake does n't live in italy , but i 'm taking the piss out of his americanisms , not accusing him of some sort of cultural sabotage . 
  i would suggest dialing back your defense-o-meter a couple of notches . 
  from this thread :  y' all  same shit  homicide  hell we are  24/7  public defenders, 
  why is an american wearing an italian flag in order to tell europeans what to do ? 
  can you imagine if the english were allowed to make banners ? 
  haha ha ha h, 
  it 's meant to be funny , us ` english speakers ' understand that in our own language . 
  i 've never seen them in europe before so it might be unfamiliarity . 
  they 're really common here in malaysia through . 
  another factor is that these ` kids ' have not experienced how shit the life is that their ( great - ) grandparents fled from . 
  `` oh , woe is me , i live in a rundown suburb of one of the most developed nations on earth . 
  i wish it was more like algeria here . '', 
   as a norn ironer , i 'd be down for that . 
  so will it be israel or palestine ? 
  i 'm pretty sure you could get 95 % the same thing in rural donegal and not have to drive the length of the country just to find yet another cloudy night . 
  go to one of the black areas on a clear night and you can see that but with less saturation .
