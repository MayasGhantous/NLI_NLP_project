  we 're up to our necks in fenian oil !, 
  shhhhh !, 
  all those military bases across your country are just friendly reminders of your eternal friendship with your great allies who will never let anything bad happen to you ever again . 
  what , i 'm delusional and they * are * plotting the invasion of europe ? 
  can we have our subreddit back please ? 
  why is / r/europe populated mostly by people who are neither in nor from europe ? 
  coming for rome and al-andalus are they ? 
  grow up . 
  they do that everywhere . 
  call themselves `` ex-pats '' and complain how britain is being ruined by the `` immigrants '' . 
  i would imagine it depends on how people feel about whether their head of state represents them adequately or not . 
  it 's satisfying to say `` you 're a cool guy , you 're doing an important job , you 're welcomeing foreign leaders into a home , here , have a really nice house '' . 
  not so satisfying to say `` you rule by might because the military supports your claim mostly due to who your father was , here , take a quarter of my income for the year to build a new castle '' . 
  i 'm not so sure that was * ever * a point of pride for the common people . 
  why would a yank have heard of them ? 
  it 's our country they 're reaming , not yours . 
  you could google them if you wanted . 
  those would be the two main anti-european organisations that have in the past successfully campaigned against the passing of both the nice treaty and the lisbon treaty in ireland . 
  read up , yank , your own ignorance is not an argument . 
  i do believe the french used to shave their heads . 
  you say this as if american organisations like libertas and youth defence are not doing the same in ` swing nations ' . 
  six pints of bitter . 
  and quickly , please because the world 's about to end . 
  * oh , yes , sir ? 
  nice weather for it . 
  going to the match today , sir ? 
  no point . 
  * foregone conclusion then eh ? 
  arsenal no chance ? 
  * no , the world 's about to end . 
  * oh , yes , sir . 
  so you said . 
  lucky escape for arsenal if it did . 
  nah , pretty popular in ireland too , if you say it right it sounds kind of like spitting . 
  * gaelic is a language family , the name of our language ( in english ) is irish . 
  * no , i 'm quoting a carlsberg ad that pokes fun of the phenomenon that you 're referring to . 
  if you run it through google translate yourself you might get a surprise * 3 . 
  * i do n't speak great irish but , like most irish people , can write fairly well . 
  we learn to do so for 14 years and it 's much easier to learn to read and write than to learn to converse naturally when you do not have any native speakers nearby . 
  * some of us are fairly fluent ; my wife is a gaeilgeoir . 
  * it was a fad on here for about a week to write in both your native language and english . 
  obviously the french are the ones still carrying it on because , well , they 're french * . 
  `` the substantial anti-islam sentiment in germany and austria at the moment '' is n't a sentence . 
  what about it ? 
  there are about two dozen nationalities and ideologies that would make people suspect terrorism . 
  this one does n't appear to fit those . 
  what 's your point ? 
   i do n't know what farage is offering as an alternative . 
  i guess he has n't any why , empire , greatness , churchill , magna carta , sun never setting , and all that . 
  britain . 
  again , if you actually read the story , those passports are in no way ` legal ' . 
  the person you 're backing up is claiming that you can buy legitimate , legal , unrevokable eu passports for $ 600 . 
  you are linking to a story about irish people who have had their passports confiscated paying a lot more than $ 600 to obtain a passport which was not in the end even legit or legal . 
  please note how he said `` legal passport '' and the fact that you 're linking to a story about people being arrested . 
  yes , it 's normal . 
  the idea is that the president , who signs laws and often has the power of pardon , is both in the position of being a possible target of the parliament , and also powerful enough to simply quash any charges against him . 
  by granting immunity it prevents two things : him abusing his power , and people targeting him if he stops parliament doing whatever they please . 
  this is mostly intended for situations where the president is a good guy . 
   are over half the countries define : [ ** fucked over ** ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fucked+over )  making the public pay for the fuck ups of the private sector ( with billions in interest ) . 
  you do n't get to play innocent as if the public were n't and did n't and do n't still benefit from the shenanigans that went on . 
  the irish `` public '' did n't create our debts either but we sure as fuck have n't left it to everyone else to clean up after us . 
  we do ? 
  they fucked over half the countries here by deciding the best way to deal with massive debt was letting your neighbours worry about it . 
  no thanks . 
  why is iceland so often reported on ? 
  why are other microstates not reported on the same way ? 
  there 's that famous german sense of humour, 
   like calling all of the uk `` england '' or eastern spain `` aragon '' . 
  right , but if you meet someone from birmingham you 're allowed to call them english . 
  we do n't like american jokes . 
  it 's a european thing , you would n't get it , 
  \u00bf \u028dou \u0287noq\u0250 \u028do\u0265, 
  you 're the worst bot ever , joebidenbot . 
  thanks obama, 
  alice ? 
  alice ? 
  who ? 
  standard daily mail warning applies . 
  pretty funny to see them blame council tax when it 's about 5 % of the costs they quoted . 
  wrong sockpuppet account , genius . 
  12 it is , then . 
  you asked `` what are you on about '' . 
  if you want to know * who * i 'm on about , ask * who * . 
  accuracy of language is important , but i guess at least you did n't say ` youse ' . 
   since the man our neighbours currently plan to put on a five pound note  the man  winston churchill , `` a hero of the entire free world '' . 
  i assume you 've read these posts as you 've downvoted them all ( great reddiquette !, 
  ) , but are deciding to act dumb ? 
  also , you did n't answer the question . 
  12 , or jackeen ? 
  the black and tans ? 
  are you 12 and havent gotten there in history class yet , or a jackeen unconcerned with the rest of the country ? 
  you built our cities for us and then fell for our redheads so started speaking irish to get to them . 
  go intimidate the canadians again !, 
  remove farikol , remove farikol , 1014 best year of my life, 
  `` we like having control over fishing '' you sure do . 
  did you know we used to have salmon in ireland ? 
  well yes , it 's actually not ` russia ' , its whoever is running the facebook page of the russian consulate in sweden , and doing so in response to a swedish official writing about russia , so what they 're referring to is going to mention sweden . 
  the actual ( translated ) message was `` it 's the will of the west , not least sweden '' . 
  `` not least '' does n't mean `` sweden did it ! '', 
  i 'm not sure why i 'm bothering to read the article for you .
