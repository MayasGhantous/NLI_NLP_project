  i have no idea why i 'm asking this of an american whose username is a play on ` lynching party ' . 
  right but leitrim [ just had its first traffic signal lights installed ] ( http://www.joe.ie/news/leitrim-gets-first-set-of-traffic-lights/553350 ) , it 's all high-rises and gangs from here, 
   it 's nothing to be worried about , perhaps unless you 're an illegal immigrant or an islamic extremist . 
  you have no understanding or experience of how these people work . 
  once you give someone a mandate to act upon their own definition of ` french enough ' , it 's difficult to take it away . 
  turkey believe that those groups are one and the same , the syrian one just being a way to get legitimacy in syria . 
  ssshhh you 're ruining the jerk . 
  next you 'll go and tell him about vietnam 's peaceful integrated muslim population . 
  there 's no such thing as an `` ethnic saudi arabian '' , nor is `` arab '' a single ethnicity either . 
  you would n't describe a moroccan or sudanese or omani as the same race , but they 're all arabs . 
  similarly , you would n't describe a bedouin and adnanite as the same ethnicity ; they 're both citizens of saudi arabia ( or elsewhere , because the ethnicity is n't tied to the citizenship ) . 
  right . 
  but you used a citizenship in your example . 
  there 's no reason a welshman ca n't be a saudi arabian , as welsh is an ethnicity and saudi arabian is a citizenship . 
  you picked a really bad example . 
  welsh is a nationality without a sovereign nation . 
  saudi arabian is a citizenship with no nationality . 
  `` saudi '' just refers to the ruling royal family , and ` arabian ' could be any of a dozen or so ethnicities and nationalities . 
  no , it does n't . 
  literally . 
  there are strict conditions that apply involving your parents being permanent residents for 8 years ; and before 2000 , it was not even possible at all . 
  deport him ... to prison ... australia ? 
   crosses of st george are n't religious symbols , they 're national symbols especially when worn large on a shirt , a symbol dating back to the hundred years war i 'm pretty sure the participants would be surprised to hear you suggest that , particularly when even today anyone wearing a st george 's cross is also quite like to start waving their arms around to the sky and singing about god saving the defender of the faith . 
  priest 's collars ? 
  st george 's cross tshirts ? 
  arab tourists are pretty terrible at communicating in any language but given how quickly they will express displeasure at everything from air conditioning to the presence of indians to having to queue for anything at all , i ca n't imagine them happily wandering into an asylum camp like it 's summer fun time . 
   yes it \\ s the same rule for everyone , respect the ritual . 
  well , 49 % of people anyway . 
  i 'll amend my comment . 
  edit : said comment has in fact been autodeleted because i linked to a shitty article . 
  how bizarre . 
  apparently the / r/europe userbase is not trusted to judge just how shitty the article is . 
  here 's the previous comment : i 'm no fan of the catholic church but there is no dress code \\* , no restriction on anyone attending a mass , and apparently no restriction on using them to make a point - the op link should make that apparent . 
  i can vouch that walking around taking pictures during a service is n't barred either . 
  disrupting the mass is , but for outsiders that mainly means blundering through it in a chinese or american tour group . 
  \\* yes , there is a dress code ( [ in more restrictive churches ] ( http://195.234.240.212/femail/article-1351622/my-big-fat-gypsy-wedding-we-reveal-140-000-cost.html ) ) . 
  it 's a ` please do n't wear ' code , similar to the one for entering a supermarket . 
  it is not a ` these are the specific items of clothing you are allowed to wear ' code , which is what i meant . 
  you can visit ( some ) mosques here in kuala lumpur , but not when they 're in ` service ' . 
  you certainly ca n't walk up the front and make a show of yourself to prove a point . 
  his ` all work out in the end ' is part of him mocking you . 
  there is a difference between it being common and it being aggressively enforced by both peer pressure and law . 
  even in ` moderate ' countries like malaysia , rejecting the ( relatively new , in south east asia ) pressure to wear conformist hijab takes being a [ pop star ] ( http://english.astroawani.com/entertainment-news/worst-discrimination-against-me-has-come-malays-yuna-111638 ) or [ princess ] ( http://www.todayonline.com/world/asia/johor-princess-quits-social-media-over-tudung-criticism ) . 
  not that it would matter - i expect to be downvoted any time israel is mentioned , and any time [ islam is mentioned ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/4taqk9/how_terrorism_in_the_west_compares_to_terrorism/d5gkq1j ) , and any time [ christianity is mentioned ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/4tbsg1/how_do_todays_irish_feel_about_old_rebel_songs_in/d5gnkhm ) - but ... 
  i 'm not being downvoted ? 
  all my posts are at 1 , i.e. 
  even . 
  this without having to delete any preposterously nonsensical posts that show just how poorly educated i am either . 
  everything i 've said has been about the respective countries ' economies ; pointing out your deficiencies is not ` anglophobic ' - phobias are irrational . 
  [ the treat of union document itself , article 1 ] ( http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/images/articles%20of%20union%20l_tcm4-564518.jpg ), 
  because i 'm talking historically , not right now . 
  england is making up for the damage it did , but only to the bare minimum point of keeping its subject nations dependant . 
  even then , it 's not doing a great job . 
  northern ireland continues to slide further and further down a depressing path that for all the world looks like a deliberate plan to make it a poisoned chalice when it does eventually leave the uk . 
  if you were paranoid , that is . 
  edit : grow up and stop downvoting an opinion you do n't like . 
  i like how you 're mad about calling us southern ireland rather than referring to the border as an ` internal border ' !, 
  just make it simple , modern and catchy , a unique brand to truly identify the core strengths . 
  united kingdom was first used with the previous ( 1701 ? ), 
  act of union between england and scotland . 
  it was the official descriptor if not the name , like `` republic of '' is ours . 
  more importantly , it took the eu . 
  why is it a baseless opinion ? 
  every constituent country of the uk runs a deficit that is paid for by england/london . 
  this is not a good thing , for any of them . 
  england has siphoned resources from the rest of the uk for centuries , that it is more prosperous having bled the rest dry and then done nothing to actually improve its subjects is not a surprise . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  if israel wanted to it could have a peaceful resolution tomorrow . 
  it does n't want to . 
  it wants ` justice ' , enacted not upon those who killed jews but upon people who lived peacefully alongside jews for millenia until zionists showed up and declared the place their own . 
  edit : the guy deleted a comment that i ca n't help but paste here because of just how bafflingly idiotic it was . 
   like when the irish settled in australia ? 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  you do n't realise people were * deported * from ireland to australia ? 
  people were deported from ireland by britain to australia for crimes such as homelessness and eating food during a famine . 
  is this how bad history lessons are in israel ? 
  been to gaza much , have you ? 
  i 'm sure there are rolling hills upon which men with improvised rockets can line up to be annihilated with the finest firepower america can buy . 
  could you tell me where those open areas would be ? 
  you 're waiting on irish outrage because of a reaction to having land stolen ? 
  you 'll wait a long time . 
  britain waited 800 years and so will you . 
  the zionist movement began taking palestinian land by coin and by force in the 1800s . 
  the palestinian people were governed by another country - so was mine - but they were n't being hunted from their land and pushed into concrete cages . 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  and downplaying the german role in the holocaust ? 
  is that what they 've started teaching you ? 
  do they not have a right to at least be annoyed at israel 's existence ? 
  the palestinian people are being punished for your people 's crimes . 
  germany gets to swan around as europe 's gentle heart while the damage you caused continues to fester and weep , just nicely out of sight . 
  people do n't seem to understand how gaza works . 
  i remember the usual israeli apologists during the aerial bombardment of gaza a couple of years ago saying the palestinians were firing from populated areas to use people as human shields ( that the israelis then bombed anyway ) . 
  this would be a valid point if the entirety of gaza - sea to wall - did n't have the population density of hong kong . 
  i 'm asking a very simple question . 
  which of those countries deported their own citizens ? 
  i knew what you were referring to . 
  which of those countries deported its own citizens ? 
  like the finest icelandic fermented fish . 
  the lack of eu regulations means britain can revert to the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that suited them for millennia before eu-bigwigs interfered . 
   follow the norwegian quotas that are very sustainable as opposed to the eu ones .
