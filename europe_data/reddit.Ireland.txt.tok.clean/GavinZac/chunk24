   finally , i am not in fact rallying against the segregation of the sexes generally as you suggest ( although i definitely think it 's very silly ) i 'm sorry but the first and longer paragraph of the comment i replied to was addressing exactly that without mention of athos . 
  i think it was reasonable to think that that was a generalised opinion . 
  athos appeared in the second paragraph seemingly as an example . 
  the * example * is silly , as we 've both said , but that was n't what i was concerned with . 
  do n't think i 'm arguing for you to be excluded from a part of your country , that is beyond the pale indeed . 
  certainly on religious grounds , at least . 
  you are entirely correct , i should have noted that there was an enemy of principles being fought then too . 
  who am i to say what side your grandparents fought on . 
   the same principles are not applied to all-girl schools or nunneries . 
  i can tell you , as a former teacher in an all-girls school , that the same principle applies almost exactly - that * anyone 's * true potential can only be reached in a same sex environment . 
  even with the decline of segregated sexes , you can see the arguments still being made constantly in the education field about how much better girls do without boys around - of course , like the monks , at the cost of other social benefits . 
   in the cases of nunneries , the idea is to protect women from men and prevent pregnancy , not to forestall impure thoughts . 
  this is not true . 
  historically , women were seen as the sexually voracious sex , and that is exactly what a nunnery existed to fight . 
  historically , women are protected from men * by being married to men * . 
  yes i understand that . 
  but your indignation about separation of sexes is what i 'm commenting on . 
  i do n't particularly believe that monastic isolation has much value but its not as clear cut as saying it 's a ` women 's bodies are dirty ' thing when the same principles are applied in nunneries and all-girl schools . 
  the scale is silly , yes , like non-muslims being barred entirely from entering cities in arabia . 
  you know that nunneries are also single-sex ? 
  and wait until you hear about single-sex schooling . 
  there 's a whole new world for you to get offense jollies from . 
  or `` our grandparents died to guarantee our rights to live by these principles and we must not now abandon them because of sporadic threats to our own lives '' . 
  he says * in the west * and * in ankara * . 
  he 's talking about people with anti-russian agendas in these places , not those places in general . 
  but do n't let me stop you trying to spread hysteria . 
  you know the people assad and putin are fighting are sunni ` islamists ' too ? 
  of course you do n't , this is / r/europe . 
  you 're going to get the same rote-learned response about waiting for the british that every polish person has been tested on . 
  tap . 
  did you just assume his ethnolinguistic superfamily ? 
  yes , let 's all be like * belgium * . 
  globalisation is the jews . 
  globalism is the muslamics . 
  keep up . 
  we 're blaming the banks for rent prices now ? 
  can we blame bertie too ? 
  and the brits ? 
  well since you asked , in ireland a minority of people boycott israeli goods and there are sometimes small protests when someone is representing israel . 
  for example , a dundalk fan held up a palestine flag at a match against a croatian team , and the club was fined $ 18,000 , or roughly a fifth of the entire prize money for winning their league . 
  in poland they [ protest israeli teams like this ] ( http://english.ahram.org.eg/media/news/2011/11/21/2011-634574981782230622-223.jpg ) and ukraine [ has nazi brigades like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hcjbutzl.jpg ) . 
  greece and ukraine have anti-semitic parties in parliament and in lithuania [ government-sanctioned neo-nazi parades are routine ] ( http://defendinghistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/antisemitic-caricature.jpg ) . 
  i 've personally seen the swastikas drawn on farm sheds alongside the train from krakow to auschwitz , where we went to see actual antisemitism . 
  but yes , belive what ynet and jpost tells you , we 're the real anti-semites . 
  i kind of hope you actually believe that , as it 'll mean you are blissfully ignorant of the situation in eastern europe . 
  turns out to be properly anti-semitic you have to have actually had a decent semitic population at some point . 
  well , yes . 
  that happens when you steal our passports for the purposes of murder . 
  skiing in the netherlands always falls a bit flat . 
  a burka covers the whole body . 
  a niqab covers the whole face . 
  ` a ' hijab covers the hair and neck . 
  ( really , they are all forms of hijab . 
  hijab is the concept of covering for modesty . 
  different islamic regions have different words for what the west calls ` a ' hijab ) . 
  i think the biggest enemy of the palestinian people are the foreign people who stole their land by force within living memory . 
  ireland lost the war too . 
  took britain 800 years to figure out we did n't care . 
  that 's just german face . 
  she 's thrilled, 
  the terms were federation - limited autonomy for both regions within a greater whole . 
  greeks have proven themselves unable to live in a mixed society and so ` each to his own ' becomes a solution . 
  this was universally accepted as a solution to the problem , and was expected to be accepted by the enosis government of cyprus ( if you think that 's gone away , you 've been deluded . 
  attend literally any international football match in cyprus ) so that they could join the eu . 
  they rejected it , and yet the eu admitted them - including an area they have no control over - regardless . 
  you ask why turkey would give up ` control ' . 
  i ask you why turkey is there in the first place . 
  turkey 's main interest is that ethnic turks do n't get massacred . 
  again . 
  the turkish government has agreed to a reunified state several times . 
  the enosis government keeps rejecting it . 
  a crippled cyprus is in the greek 's interest . 
  there 's that famous german sense of humour . 
  in case you did n't get it - r ** u ** ssi ** a **, 
  fun fact , ua is part of russia, 
  and it 's probably best to avoid confusion with britain 's government coalition . 
  listen buddy you ca n't go around just calling people * catholic *, 
  \\* swamp-german, 
  whereas doring-kingsley are reliably omniscient, 
   the credibility i have on the eu is as low as it can be . 
  this is true , but i do n't think you mean what it actually means . 
  i 'm from cork in ireland which is a ` dairy county ' , so i 've been drinking extremely fresh milk all my life . 
  i first encountered uht on a flight to spain for a family holiday when i was ten years old . 
  it came in this little tub with a rip off lid . 
  it made my tea taste like plastic . 
  :( now i live in thailand where milk is a foreign speciality so almost everywhere just uses uht . 
  i 've tasted it quite a bit . 
  i live in thailand . 
  you may also like rancid meat and stale bread !, 
  same nutrition , awful taste . 
  so we should be more like hungary ? 
  team sports are by far the strongest sports in this country as it 's part of our culture . 
  hungary 's culture leans towards individual sports , as focused on by the ussr for most of a century . 
  team sports are also underrepresented at the olympics ; sports should be evaluated by more than just medal count at the olympics . 
  we also , fortunately or unfortunately , have the gaa . 
  for better or for worse , it 's the second highest participation sports organisation in the country , and is not represented at the olympics . 
  hungary does not have such ` problems ' . 
  ireland population : 5 million-ish medals : 5 uk population : 65 million-ish medals : 65 our medal performance was on par with britain 's , taking into account the smaller pool available . 
  `` not this shit again '' -- ireland, 
  this is true anywhere i 've been .
