  it 's a pretty accurate stereotype to say that the japanese are generally pretty racist . 
  i 'm not sure what the other stereotype is , unless you do n't know what a stereotype is . 
  you 're clearly very proud of knowing 3 languages . 
  you know that 's called ` growing up ' for most people in the world , right ? 
  sure , i 'd like to know more . 
  why do you think learning japanese and speaking english and spanish gives you insight into other cultures , when the nonsense you spout contradicts this directly ? 
   anyway , i think this sub alone is proof enough of european idiocy . 
  of course , that does n't include you , right ? 
  fuck off to totally-not-racist / r/japan then , they 'll love to hear your new language . 
   right , though by everyone 's admission , cy is in europe ( and not just the eu ) both `` culturally '' and `` politically '' . 
  everyone 's ? 
   canada is european wat, 
  that 's ... not quite what i meant . 
  the borders of europe are arbitrary on one side , a line drawn through eurasia . 
  they 're quite physical on the other . 
  besides , canada would have little to gain from joining the eu . 
   it is bold , but europe includes russia . 
  any reason we ca n't just say * it does n't * ? 
  the borders of europe have been arbitrarily defined by what is convenient for millenia , and they 're not * really * european , not as much as their little greek fantasies suggest anyway . 
  * everything * is a very specific set/category . 
  everything is doomed , if you never bother to specify a timespan . 
  yes , that 's the problem with doomsaying , sometimes it drags on for decades or even centuries , and by the time you get something actually resembling the prediction you 've made , everyone you warned is long dead having spent their lives in a wonderous doooooom-free existence . 
  dooooooooomed dooooooooooooooooooooomed, 
  now what ( named for it first utterances of the pioneers who settled there ) 's chief export is the pelt of the nowwhatian bog hog , hideous creatures that communicate chiefly by biting each other . 
  so , yeah , moldova, 
  the free state of the democratic people 's united federated former yugoslavian republic of the most serene europe darussalam . 
  `` the sun sets at precisely 19:23 ( cet ) on the european empire '', 
  hmm . 
  the united republic of europe and great britain and ireland ? 
   especially since the two dominant eu nations , germany and france , were the main antagonists in wwi . 
  which is a fantastic reason to display it . 
  we should really be proud of the eu , but fuck it , those 26 million romanians emigrating to the uk have really done it in . 
   after a few ** thousand ** years of the english language you what , mate ? 
  right , so option a then . 
  you should probably look at the date , or read the article . 
  those were men on the ground * after * the fighting to prevent more fighting during the referendum . 
  headlines are a hell of a thing . 
  if you have evidence that the soldiers in crimea were foreign , you should publicise it . 
  `` they were well equipped '' does n't count . 
  if you do n't , and you 're referring to ethnic russians born in ukraine as `` foreign '' , then consider why this all came about . 
   and perhaps hitler 's referendum in austria was legitimate too , while we 're at it !, 
  hey look everyone !, 
  this guy reads the reddit front page !, 
   or russia could fuck off and let ukraine make its own decisions . 
  jesus , there 's some thinking ireland could have done with 100 years ago, 
  yes , that 's because the only person who wrote that is the person complaining about it . 
  you mean the ones who literally use the english flag with the ulster red hand hastily pasted into the middle of it ? 
   no , the soldiers who are not in the ukraine are not kindapping people within the ukraine . 
  congratulations , you have made a completely useless point , namely that a single person ca n't be at two places at once . 
  great . 
  * i 've * made a useless point ? 
  i laughed at a pathetic overreach from a journalist on `` the daily beast '' admitting ignorance but speculating anyway , and you [ started going on about russian troop movements ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/25x96s/ukraine_journalists_still_enduring_brutal/chlukx6 ) . 
  when asked what that had to do with anything , [ you attempted to evade it with sarcasm ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/25x96s/ukraine_journalists_still_enduring_brutal/chlxlt0 ) which you then [ withdrew when asked a second time ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/25x96s/ukraine_journalists_still_enduring_brutal/chlzr46?context=3#chlyln5 ) . 
  now you 're making definitive statements based on fluff in order to deflect again . 
  hey , you do n't happen to write for the daily beast , do you ? 
   the usa  americas  if the us does  how bad the us is  us propaganda http://replygif.net/i/310.gif, 
  ** the soldiers , in russia , along the ukrainian border : are they kidnapping journalists ? 
  ** i 'm currently programming , and this is a logic problem you seem to be having , so i 'll use pseudocode . 
  if ( true ) { why have the journalists themselves denied this ? }, 
  else { what the fuck does that have to do with journalists in east ukraine ? }, 
   if the united kingdom sent troops to surround dublin dublin is * in * ireland . 
  if you suggested ` on the ni-ie border ' that would be more relevant . 
  although , it 's not a far comparison , since there are special treaties regarding the use of military troops in n.ireland at the moment . 
   and then irishmen and women opposing it were kidnapped and beaten by british people living and working in ireland with clear sympathies to the crown , you 'd have a massive problem with that . 
  i would . 
  with those british people . 
  especially if the people kidnapped said `` it was n't mi5 , it was the uda '' . 
  if the united kingdom fell into chaos , ukip seized power and began dismantling the institutions of northern ireland in order to punish irish people there for having an identity , i would want ireland to intervene . 
  so these soldiers are kidnapping journalists ? 
  that 's russia 's dastardly role ? 
  reporting with a bias ? 
  literally putin . 
   it is also impossible to tell whether any russian personnel are directly involved in the abductions ; lefter has said that his captors were all local insurgents . 
  but , in a larger sense , russia 's role in these events is not in doubt . 
  lol, 
  [ `` anyone would think you want ireland to * lose * the next eurosong contest !, 
  '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmbqbkfbl0e#t=1279 ), 
  eurovision is tv network , completely unrelated to the european union . 
  ah yes , the next great strategy . 
  `` at least they 're not fine gael or fianna fail '' . 
  bound to work this time . 
  to be fair , it was only 10 years ago that they were nearly extinct . 
  they only exist `` because they are n't fianna fail '' , a voting strategy by the irish public which seems to have been remarkably ironic since they are pretty much just fianna fail . 
  insemination requires violation of personal space . 
  for finns , it 's a catch 22 situation, 
  what else are they going to do ? 
  mostly sarcasm . 
  hence describing the roma palaces as ` nice ' . 
  uh , then what 's your point ? 
  international travel in this modern age of globalisation ? 
  revelatory stuff , screech . 
   i could easily go to the us or maybe even countries like sweden or germany and make it look as bad as the picutres of romania . 
  possible , sure . 
  easily ? 
  remember , we 're talking about romania , and not the nice roma built palace areas either . 
  if you think this is war , no wonder you guys are so `` interventionist '' . 
   as crimea now `` claims '' itself to be part of russia , how would this move be considered ? 
  the military of a foreign country officially invading another ? 
  the irish republican army had nothing to do with ( and indeed several times attacked ) the republic of ireland . 
  you 're basically in wales anyway , just support their inevitable split !,
