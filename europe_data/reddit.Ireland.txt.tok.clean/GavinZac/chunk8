  after a couple of years , with the europeans he eventually led them to where his old village had been - and found it in ruins and deserted . 
  his townfolk had returned , one or more of them now carrying the disease , and dropped like flies . 
  later colonisers had a better understanding of germ theory . 
  smallpox was one of the first diseases postulated to be spread by tiny microscopic , even * air carried * worms . 
  transmission causes were well understood . 
  however , a devil-may-care attitude certainly contributed to the spread , such as in cases where a sick indian working on a steam boat ( seems odd to even think of those technologies and peoples together ) spread the disease all the way up the missouri :  `` fulkerson requested of the steamboat captain that he put the first man to come down with smallpox off the boat . 
  captain pratte , who was a principal in the fur company that owned the boat , refused to stop or turn back because of the disease , for turning back would have interfered with his delivery of trade goods . 
  that would have caused havoc with his business , and put his traders in danger from angry indians who were counting on the trade goods . 
  thus the brunt of responsibility for the epidemic lies with pratte , for refusing to cancel his trip upriver once the smallpox was discovered aboard . 
  upon william fulkerson 's return from the steamboat trip , he warned william clark that : `` the small pox has broke out in this country and is sweeping all before it -- unless it be checked in its mad career i would not be surprised if it wiped the mandan and rickaree [ arikara ] tribes of indians clean from the face of the earth . '' '', 
  if there is major blame , it is for wilful negligence rather than any particular biological warfare scheme . 
  this was an era of racial supremacy , and examples like this - seeing the misfortune of others as an opportunity , perhaps even god given - were well alive in europe , let alone in america . 
  idly standing by , or pressing ahead with ones plans when disaster * for others * seemed likely was par for the course . 
  here 's some quotes on the irish famine :  [ the famine ] `` would not kill more than one million people , and that would scarcely be enough to do any good . '', 
  nassau senior , economics professor , oxford university  english colonisation and english policy might be most effectively carried out by irish starvation . 
  edmund spenser lord trevelyn , the man in charge of the running of ireland from britain , is the most damned and a name stamped forever on the minds of irishmen describing the famine over which he presided as `` a direct stroke of an all-wise and all-merciful providence '' , calling it  `` the sharp but effectual remedy by which the cure is likely to be effected . 
  most of the ones outside of the current usa , yes . 
  the northeast , i.e. 
  where the usa began , was still pretty densely populated when the british showed up . 
  then a little while later , it was n't ... edit : evidently some people believe the epidemics were all during the 1500s . 
  this is not true . 
  there were east coast epidemics well into the 1700s . 
   whilst i played no part in what actually happened to the subjects of the british empire , i reap the benefits of our colonial passed you 're one of the first brits i 've ever seen admit this !, 
  so many are like `` we 're rich because we worked so hard and industrialised and sent men down mines '' as if rubber trees and petroleum lurk beneath wales . 
  yes . 
   what else do you want us to do ? 
  when will you accept us ? 
  when will you start visiting us and start realizing that we 're , in fact , very nice people ( for the most part ) ? 
  when friendly visitors from little places like ireland do n't need police escorts around belgrade or get chairs lobbed at them and their flags set on fire , because in large sections of your society your history is 100 years out of date and you have n't done anything about it in 20 years . 
  so your comment is nothing to do with self-determination for the trans-dniestr region , and more at home in / r/preppers ? 
   similarly well equipped to the us military and paid for by the eu budget . 
  no thanks . 
  yeah it does seem quite a bit off . 
  the worst of the rainfall should hug the coast , like in norway . 
  here 's a more detailed one of ireland , from our meteorological society : http://www.met.ie/climate/images/climate_rainfallmap.gif you can see my ` house ' is not quite so bad as that of my western neighbour 's , predictably in our little version of the fjords , 
  see that green spot in the south of ireland ? 
  that 's my house . 
  does it count as a language if nobody speaks to each other ? 
  ireland gets a good deal more rain than even britain . 
  we 're the first thing the atlantic hits . 
  you 're not wrong with your guess , but / u/temujin64 is right too . 
   stifle any attempts at changing something ( courtesy ala nsa ) . 
  * courtesy of * , or , * a la * . 
  not both . 
  if you 're going to be a tinfoil hatter , and going to get the organisation wrong ( the nsa are not an * active * body ) , at least do n't try to use phrases from two languages you 're not familiar with . 
  that 's not where viena is , silly urgs, 
  french guyana is n't there either . 
  because it 's in france , but not in europe . 
  how is denying people self-determination `` freedom '' ? 
  edit : ha !, 
  on mobile so did n't see your flag . 
  * carry on * . 
  `` free crimea '' i do n't think you understand what this would mean . 
  i find it quite ironic that a catalan is twisting the truth on a matter of self-determination and autonomy . 
   what does the a in apc stand for ? 
  armour , which is why i thought you must mean that , since while they are n't surrounding anything they seem to have zero relevance to anything else you said . 
  here they are , oppressing innocent ukrainians . 
  [ look at that chubby motherfucker oppressing her with his eyes . 
  ] ( http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/files/2014/03/ukraine-0303.jpg )  the russian crimean local militia who carries russian weapons under russian officers and has russian equipment ? 
  come on you rt , and a couple of other people are the only people in the world still falling for the `` local militia '' ruse yeah this is a crack commando squad if i 've ever seen one . 
  probably putin 's personal guard on a very special mission . 
  wait * [ is that a midget ? 
  ] ( http://thechronicleherald.ca/sites/default/files/imagecache/ch_article_main_image/articles/b97289221z.120140302145426000g3n4u64j.21.jpg ) *, 
   armour rolling into a land peninsular and surrounding army bases and demanding their surrender ? 
  what on earth are you talking about ? 
  do you mean the apcs carrying supporting troops from one russian base to another ? 
  or do you mean the ` russian ' / crimean local militia that has surrounded an airfield ? 
   in seriousness , read through a quick summary on the nazi invasion of czechslovakia . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_occupation_of_czechoslovakia[1] in particular note the `` protecting ethnic germans '' argument yes , i 'm aware of highschool history , thanks . 
  it was a rhetorical question , my apologies if that is not clear in interlingual conversation . 
  what i mean was , czechoslovakia was not tearing itself apart when hilter decided to ` help ' the germans in sudetenland . 
  ukraine * is * . 
   is there a large number of russian troops in the country ? 
  not only are there large numbers of russian troops in the country , there are russian * bases * in the country . 
  which is how they got there . 
  there has n't been a single engagement , which is more than can be said for the situation * before * the chest-puffing started . 
  look around you . 
  people - yourself - are comparing this to the nazi invasion of eastern europe , before a shot has been fired . 
  it 's baffling . 
  * do you kind of wish it were true ? 
  i 'm not aware that czechia was in a state of chaos under an unelected government that represented the diametric opposite of the interests of the sudetenland when hitler invaded . 
  was it ? 
   and man you have really drunk some pr kool-aid there . 
  can you say you have not , yourself ? 
  they have n't actually invaded ukraine . 
  they have their warships in * their * port in crimea ready to protect the people of crimea from the unelected ` government ' that has seized power in kiev . 
  `` ukrainean '' / crimean ( crimea was an autonomous area only nominally part of the ukraine before the chaos in kiev ) forces are also standing by to stop any bloodshed . 
  no shots have been fired . 
  this has n't stopped the western media baying for the slavs to kill each other though . 
  in cork it 's `` de lor ' mare '', 
  if they have , it has n't worked yet - tanzania , very strange , only charges 3 countries more than the standard amount of $ 50 : usa ( $ 100 , reciprocation ) , pakistan ( $ 200 , terrorism ? ), 
  and * ireland * ( $ 100 ) . 
  i guess we must have insulted their cuisine or something . 
  * intermission * is very accurate to dublin !, 
  unfortunately , their rhetoric and tactics are stupid and reactionary . 
  for instance , they were against the lisbon treaty in 2008 because we 'd just moved from financial net receivers to net contributors in the eu , so they thought it was a good idea to spit in the faces of the people who * made * us net contributors , a few months into what was to become a deep deep recession which would plunge us back into receiving again . 
    if civilization can survive genghis khan , it can survive this . 
  did it though ? 
  * did it ?
