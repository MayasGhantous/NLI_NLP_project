  that 's a meal for two in my new home in asia . 
  edit : bear in mind that you can walk across cork in 20 minutes if it was n't for the hills and rain !, 
  in ireland we say hello getting on ( the bus , not many trams around ) , and thanks getting off . 
  we spend the intervening period swearing quietly about how disgustingly expensive public transport is now . 
  while i can understand that , it 's arguably easier to get around france with its tgvs and motorways than it is , for example , italy or scotland . 
  anyway , i think the chart would n't be too influenced by fans who only go to ` home ' games - i think it counts fans who go to any games at all . 
  and waving flags of other countries ... 
  part of the issue is france 's much shallower domestic league . 
  england has 92 professional teams ( at least ) , france has around 40 . 
  you could settle it with penalties . 
  i lived in thailand and now malaysia . 
  ca n't count the number of times i 've seen tourists approach a food cart vendor with no english and say something like `` uuuhhm , can i get a bit of that chicken there please . 
  wait , is it spicy ? '', 
  christ , lad , just point, 
  false . 
  each and every one of those 1 million brits in spain is a 31 year old man named ` johnny ' who says he 's 23 and calls himself a dj to sleep with chubby birds from nottingham on holidays in benidorm . 
   so they got what they deserved . 
  the removal of british soldiers , replacement of the sectarian police force , amnesty on political fighters and a written guarantee that the british would not attempt to retain northern ireland if the people democratically chose to leave the uk ? 
  what legitimacy ? 
  they did n't even recognise the sovereignty of the republic for most of their existence . 
   i 've always felt that britain and poland deserve closer ties . 
  this is n't in britain . 
  / * runs away *, 
  that 's indonesia , boy , are they going to be mad in jakarta, 
  that 's the problem with wikipedia . 
  if enough yanks think it 's true , it goes in de book . 
  most would get the gist of it . 
  `` caitheamh tabac '' is smoking , the prefix mhar - is always negative , and `` chroi '' is heart . 
  unfortunately most would n't get further than that but would , as i said , get the overview . 
  more kids are being sent to irish language schools than ever before , though . 
  good to see the penal colonies are now literate ( if not informed ) . 
  to be fair , it 's based on current countries * keeping * original capitals , not `` here is every formerly sovereign state in europe '' . 
  wales and scotland are there , and someone above me is advocating for the bloody isle of man . 
  i think we can give the north their own spot , and since belfast has been the principal city of northern ireland as long as northern ireland has existed , i think we can say that 's right too . 
  right , make a hand as if your were about holding a diamond in front of your eye to inspect it like a bond villain . 
  your thumb is now in the trigger of a device that would spray water towards your face . 
  now lift your right buttock by leaning onto your left , and put your hand - still in that pose - underneath . 
  position it so that your thumb is pointing towards your excretory orifice . 
  now pinch the air slightly , a few inches from the destination . 
  imagine a cool , soothing waterfall , gently eroding the ancient cliff face of your faecal matter . 
  it just works . 
  it 's not a fireman 's hose . 
  mushy peas are a travesty , not a food . 
  person in south east asia here : starting to think that you 're * all * a bit backwards . 
  [ the handheld bidet ( ` bum gun ' ) is superior ] ( http://www.mytap.com.au/images/ds003.jpg ) . 
  looks like the alley ( `` piss lane '' ) down the side of the peace park in cork before it was boarded up . 
  * meeeeemooooriiees , like the corner of my mind ... *, 
  `` dutch gold : your first beer ! '', 
  we went there for cork city v fc haka . 
  small town in rural finland called valkeakoski . 
  we 've played in dozens of countries in europe , and usually the arrival of a big bunch of irish people is considered a good thing , an excuse for a party . 
  in finland , we went to a `` pub '' . 
  we appeared to be the only people talking . 
  pubs in finland appear to be a place to ingest alcohol orally and nothing else . 
  eventually a scottish expatriate came over to talk . 
  began the conversation with `` good to see some brits '' . 
  turned out he was a troll ; good thing irish people are generally in a good mood on tour . 
  we went and sat outside . 
  usually this will invite fan interaction and so on . 
  for example , in sweden we got quite a few fans over . 
  scarves exchanged and so on . 
  sure enough , they appeared . 
  2 people . 
  standing , across the road , silently , waving a black haka flag . 
  they stood like that for a few minutes . 
  we called them over . 
  we suggested swapping scarves . 
  they disappeared for a moment , and came back with , not a haka scarf , but a green souvenir carlsberg leprechaun hat . 
  for us . 
  irish people . 
  eventually , someone swapped a cork city scarf , dutifully brought from ireland , for this tacky crap . 
  off they went again , and the next time we saw them , they were on a moped . 
  they drove around the block , one driving , the other riding on the back holding the black flag . 
  they drove around and around , silently except for the humourous doppler effect as they came around and again . 
  later we , found out that the entire town had been * admitted for free * , or rather paid for as a gesture of goodwill from the local paper mill as a sort of apology i suppose for the stink that permeates throughout the town from it . 
  they also built their stadium entirely from wood . 
  except us . 
  ** except the 25 or so of us that had traveled more than 1500 miles ... we had to pay 20 euro to enter . 
  ** the stadium , as i said , was entirely made of wood and was located right next to the paper mill , so it stank . 
  [ here 's some hilariously dry warning signs ... in a football stadium . 
  ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/421849_10151291713005293_2026840035_n.jpg ) [ here 's our team warming up with a better view of the stink factory adjacent ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/402112_10151291713960293_174288440_n.jpg ) . 
  we lost the game 4-0 when we should have won easily . 
  their main danger was an elderly striker who had not bothered to come to the game in ireland . 
  such are the effects of finland on irish people . 
  edit : we came up with a song !, 
  i 've just remembered it . 
  it goes like so : * oh valkeakoski , * * is full of trees , * * oh valkeakoski is full of trees . 
  * * it 's got trees , trees and more trees , * * oh valkeakoski 's full of trees . 
  * oh cork city , * * has relatively few , * * oh cork city has relatively few . 
  * * we 've got less trees than you , * * oh cork city has relatively few . 
  * oh drogheda , * * is better than this . 
  * * oh drogheda is better than this . 
  * * and drogheda smells like piss !, 
  * * but drogheda is better than this . 
  atone is not a word that is exclusive to christianity , daphne . 
  at least part of it is because of the very different experiences of life and the last 30 or 40 years that the republic and the north have had . 
  in a way , the catholics and protestants , with their endurance of terrorism , constant focus on the national issue and actually caring about religion , have more in common with each other than those of us from the south . 
  we have different accents , different news , different culture , different priorities . 
  we had our self-esteem blown to immense heights and then crushed under the recession . 
  there 's no recession in northern ireland because they had nothing to recess backwards from !,
