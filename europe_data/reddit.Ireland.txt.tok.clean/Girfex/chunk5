  i like trumpeter . 
  found the trump supporter . 
  trumpette ? 
  trumpeter ? 
  yeah , a trumpeter . 
  style over substance , clearly . 
  that 's ... that 's pretty darn accurate . 
  uk wanted a divorce . 
  what do you do after divorce papers are served ? 
  lawyer up and hit the gym . 
  europe is getting swole . 
  shh , let us deal with our own shit . 
   `` this heinous act was carried out despite the presence of five members of the zoological staff living on site and surveillance cameras . '' how the fuck do you miss 3 gunshots and a fucking chainsaw ? 
  scotland . 
  i 've been to many weddings . 
  the bride was never `` given away '' . 
  my wife only took my last name because she liked it and she wanted a break from her shitty family . 
  i 've seen 2 couples make a whole new last name , and another 2 couples take the woman 's last name . 
  maybe you should stop going to super traditional christian weddings . 
  why though ? 
  most marriages in western culture today have nothing to do with ownership of anyone . 
  it 's about a partnership . 
  say what you will about that partnership needing special government approval and benefits , but it 's a partnership nonetheless . 
  wow . 
  i 'd give some jubilee to her sapphire , * ifyaknowwhatimean * . 
  i totally get that burning anything jewish in germany is going to raise a lot of red flags , and that 's fair , but if hatred is not found to be the reason why something happens , is it a hate crime ? 
  obviously this is something you want to be super sure about either way , but we can determine the motivations of people well enough to differentiate being a negligent cunt who got drunk , crashed into someone , and killed people , and some crazy arse who got bored and shot a few people . 
  do n't mistake me , throw the idiot into prison , he 's an arsonist and that shit is super illegal all on it 's own ( obviously ) , so punish him with the quickness for that . 
  but if it 's reasonably certain he did n't do it out of hate , it 's not a hate crime . 
  i wish there were an afterlife , so that i could know that hitler would be there , having a total meltdown over seeing that . 
  irish accent . 
  you do recall there 's other english speaking people in europe , right ? 
  they may substitute the arses of farm animals , in that instance . 
  the irish government wants ukip to kiss each and every irish arse . 
  i want to be made at our placement on the map , but ... 
  no you did n't . 
  you joined the war because japan sucker-punched you . 
  and then you locked up every japanese citizen in shitty ~ ~ hellholes ~ ~ `` camps '' . 
  but i guess that 's different , yeah ? 
  you realize your country fought a long , hard war and lost a lot of lives just to punch people giving nazi salutes , right ? 
  your side of the pond has an overgrown and bloated military and more nukes . 
  also led a man who associated with nazi 's and was put into power by putin . 
  i 'm gon na go ahead and worry about your side of the pond as well . 
  it 's fascist to punch someone giving a nazi salute ? 
  til america is fascist . 
  we * want * to believe you . 
  we really do . 
  but we 're going to need you to do something about the cheeto before we can really believe you . 
  i feel perfectly alive . 
  they should have been ready at the beginning of all this . 
  we do n't want it at this point . 
  got bed bugs . 
  american education at it 's finest . 
  i do n't like you . 
  better than americans asking me if i 'm english . 
  kilts do n't seem so bad right now , do they ? 
  nice airflow , the ability to stand over air conditioning vents ... 
  trump mumbled his reply , `` yes daddy ... '', 
  if only someone had posted this earlier today ... 
  wait , is that the guy that killed hitler ? 
  what did he do ? 
  it 's not sexism if you only do it to men !, 
  haha sexism is fun . 
  not great , but better than anticipated . 
  it 's the 3rd of july in the us currently . 
  it 's fine , climate change is n't real . 
  i miss the old europe , a europe where all we did was fight with each other and kill each other in senseless wars . 
  bring back the killing and senseless violence !, 
  make europe bloody again !, 
  from what , the dup ? 
  the concept of a joke eludes you , i see . 
  [ referring jokingly to this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norman_conquest_of_england#language ), 
  i had thought *** the republic of ireland and britain *** , but now that you said it , i would vote for *** the republic of ireland and just britain *** . 
  / r/celticunion, 
  hmm , i see what you 're doing there , and i 'm fine with it , but i would be more subtle . 
  then when england complains that england is n't celtic , we can just mutter `` it was before you lot showed up and ruined it ... '', 
  no no , you 're right . 
  just `` britain '' . 
  nicely done . 
  the republic of ireland and great britain . 
  see , i think this is just a sinn f\u00e9in master ploy . 
  slowly infiltrate the other ni political circles , gain power with their opponents via misdirection and over-the-top rhetoric , dominate the uk , and then finally rejoin the republic . 
  why form a 32 county republic , when we can have 32 counties , a scotland , a wales , and an england ? 
  actually laughed out loud . 
  nicely done , wiki editor . 
  i like it . 
  and i 'm okay with promoting the eu . 
  i 'm fine with english . 
  * if * it gave the uk an advantage , that advantage will now be all for us and malta . 
  i 'm totally cool with that . 
  otherwise , i vote for klingon or dothraki . 
  i vote for klingon or dothraki . 
  let 's get crazy with this . 
  `` official '' is irrelevant . 
  * if * speaking english as commonly and as fluently as the uk offered them any advantage , it would offer the same advantage to ireland and malta . 
  i did n't say it was . 
  op claimed it was , i was merely pointing out the uk was not the only eu country with a populace with native-level fluency in english . 
  i know that , but 99.9 % of us speak english with native-level fluency , in case you 've forgotten . 
  even our politicians that are fluent as gaeilge * still * speak english with native-level fluency . 
  that fluency would give us the same advantages that op claims the uk had .
