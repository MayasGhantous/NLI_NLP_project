  this is also not great for irish nurses . 
  we train a much larger number of nurses here than the hse can ( will ) employ , and there have been issues for years with staffing in hospitals and pay/work conditions for nurses . 
  the uk was always one of the destinations a lot of young newly qualified nurses go to start their careers and get a good quality of life . 
  it will be a blow to many if that gets harder . 
  hopefully the anglo-irish arrangement remains as it is and this does n't become a bigger issue . 
  flegs for everyone !, 
  the party with haircuts from the 1960 's and brains from the 1690 's . 
  i always remember that series introducing me to the idea of a `` banality of evil '' . 
  in the episode about the holocaust it mentions who held the patents for specific parts of the piping systems in the gas chambers . 
  i do n't know why , but that really drove home the almost mundane way that horrific events can happen so easily . 
  i do n't understand how they can have so many talk shows , each with an overpaid presenter , and produce so little scripted content and get away with it . 
  ca n't remember the last time i watched an rt\u00c9 show after love/hate ended . 
  [ this might help clear it up , or make it more confusing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fy5cvaljuw ) the accent might be tough to understand . 
  my dad is a huge fan of all those kinds of tv shows and movies . 
  i call them collectively `` scandi-noir '' , i think its a fitting name . 
  yeah , i 've never understood that . 
  so many people i know spend so much of their holidays in irish pubs and i just do n't get it . 
  why go abroad to sit in a mocked up version of home and pay double the price for the same stuff you get here ? 
  we have a question on the census ( taken every 5 years ) called `` what is your ethnic or cultural background ? '', 
  an example of it can be found [ here ] ( http://www.cso.ie/en/census/faq/detailedlookatcensusquestions/question14/ ), 
  look ah yer wan , tryin ' to be a proper dub . 
  caugh ' rapih . 
  yeah , we do things a bit different ** doyn ** ** har **, 
  username checks out . 
  i had a job interview a few weeks ago on a wednesday . 
  they said they 'd let me know the next week , so i figured probably the friday a week after the next one if at all . 
  got an email less than 24 hours later . 
  i was so surprised i 'm still not sure i believe it . 
  irish eu/eea tuition rates are only for eu/eea citizens who have been resident in eu/eea for 3 of the last 5 years irc . 
  our citizenship is relatively very easy to get and our institutions could n't support a huge flood of people engaging in `` education tourism '' . 
  maybe the americans are right , maybe your whole country is really just porn . 
  works best with very fresh white bread and heaps of butter . 
  maximum flavour and maximum cholesterol . 
  ok thanks . 
  the triple negative just confused me a bit . 
   never not assumed i am not french so it 's always assumed you are french ? 
  or never assumed you are french ? 
  as far as i know davey crockett is famous for his unfortunately named `` coon-skin '' hat ( yes i know it 's short for racoon , it still sounds bad ) , drawing a line in the sand ( origin of the expression ? ), 
  at the alamo and being killed by a much larger mexican army ( led by santa anna ? ) . 
  john henry was the inspiration for songs ( mostly folk and blues ) because he did something like resisted mechanisation ? 
  all i know is the phrase steel-driving is involved . 
  daniel boone was a frontier something-or-other maybe ? 
  johnny appleseed sounds like a kids cartoon character made up to advertised some awful `` apple '' flavoured breakfast cereal . 
  how did i do ? 
  at the moment pretty much just overwatch ( xbox ) . 
  i think i 'll pick up skyrim remaster or bf1 soon . 
  waiting on combo of bug fixes and maybe better hardware to pick up civ vi . 
  getting shitfaced at home ( usually without parents around ) on store bought vodka is a time honoured tradition that all young europeans should experience . 
  i personally prefer pronouncing kansas as `` kansaw '' because it 's sillier . 
  not that i have many opportunities to use it though . 
  i would say that 's a fair assessment . 
  there was also a huge loss of respect/obedience for the church following the various reports of child abuse . 
  my granny for example stopped going to mass completely after one of the reports came out . 
  for a life long devout catholic in her 60 's to turn her back completely on the church should be an indication of how much ireland has changed over the years . 
  i ca n't say i feel sorry for the church at all . 
  contemporary poetry does n't enter most peoples day to day conversation but we are very proud of our literary traditions . 
  to the point we name [ naval vessels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samuel_beckett-class_offshore_patrol_vessel#names ) after poets/playwrights etc. 
  an interesting thing about that cultural divide is actually how certain things have almost completely flipped to the opposite side while staying the same for individuals if that makes any sense . 
  an example would be the marriage equality referendum , back in the day the hardcore catholic mentality would motivate people to get out and vote to protect `` the traditional '' family from being degraded by `` perverts '' but last year huge numbers of people ( including older people ) voted to protect their own ( lgbt ) family members from the degradation of being unequal . 
  the importance of family in irish society was still the driving factor but the perception of family had changed . 
  are you maybe confusing it with [ termonfeckin in co. 
  louth .

   but !, 
  `` l\u00e5t den r\u00e4tte komma in '' is one of the best movies i 've watched it 's in the top tier of great horror movies . 
  all about atmosphere and tension and not about cheap jump scares . 
  alternatively : dublin - the capital ( no matter what corkonians tell themselves ) galway - it 's a great little city . 
  cork - seriously , nobody wants limerick . 
  all in good fun . 
  whenever i see a copy in a bookstore here i always read a little to see how each translator handles the imagery . 
  it 's amazing what a good translator can do to help spread great work to other languages . 
  the book of kells - it 's an important piece of history . 
  ulysses - while i 'm not the biggest fan personally it is very important to the irish literary tradition . 
  dracula - one of my favourite novels and a phenomenal example of how to write atmospheric horror . 
  the world would n't be the same without the iconic count . 
  yes . 
  brexit is n't good but it 's not the end of the world . 
  i 'm already including edinburgh in my job hunting so why stop now . 
  assuming i could have a job/career roughly equivalent to my current position . 
  my list would be canada , australia , new zealand , japan , south korea , usa . 
  probably in that order , though only the east or west coasts in the us . 
  honestly this is where punctuation can improve things massively . 
  `` spider bites australian man on penis ... 
  again . '', 
   bring medicine you need with you unless it 's weed , because that is international drug trafficking and will land you in a world of shit . 
  it may not be legal everywhere op is going but it certainly will be available . 
  under the bridge ? 
  that sounds like a finnish troll trick . 
  you rang ? 
   she met the crown prince at a pub in sidney and got married . 
  i like to imagine it happened that fast . 
  mary : g'day , how you going ? 
  frederick : marry me !, 
  mary : alright . 
  priest : i now pronounce you prince and princess . 
  for example in italy or bulgaria are there serious royalist/monarchist movements that want the return of the old royal families or is it only a tiny minority fringe group that ever talks about it ? 
  if there are monarchist groups does anybody take them seriously or are they viewed as a bit of a joke ? 
  are there serious republican movements in your country or is it only a fringe interest . 
  ** for the uk ** : not including irish republicanism in n.i. 
  ( that 's a different and very complex issue ) but feel free to talk about republicanism in gb .
