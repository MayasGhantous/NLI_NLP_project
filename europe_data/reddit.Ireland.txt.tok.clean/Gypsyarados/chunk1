like put my hands up and say i made a mistake ? 
  it 's a phrase my aussie housemate taught me . 
  the greek term is the basis of the word , in both egypt and roman , before it came here . 
  i will say though , i may be misunderstanding what is meant by basis , with english not being my first language . 
  if he means origin i disagree ; if he means something like connotation , i got it wrong and i 'll cop a dick on it . 
  i 'm not arguing that it has a political slant now . 
  i would n't argue that , because there 's no argument . 
  it absolutely has a political connotation , but i 'd still say it does n't have a political basis . 
  unless , i 'm misunderstanding what you mean by basis . 
  i 'm reading basis as origin , which given the roman , greek and egyptian origins of `` britain '' , i maintain it does n't have . 
  if you mean basis as connotation ( or something similar ) , then nah fair , i 'll cop a dick on that one . 
  it does n't though . 
  the entire island group has been referred to as prettania since greek times , which the romans changed brittania . 
  brits do that too , except with the mainland obviously . 
  my thinking came from [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/calligraphy/comments/6r7uqa/arabic_calligraphy/ ) , though it appears i misunderstood things . 
  thanks though . 
  it was n't a wild guess . 
  it was an educated guess , based on what others had said , although , it turned out i 'd misunderstood the other comments . 
  awesome , that 's my new word learnt today . 
  i 've misread the other comments then . 
  thank you . 
  i got nothing then . 
  maybe i read the other comments wrong . 
  i 'm going off [ this ] ( http://reddit.com/r/calligraphy/comments/6r7uqa/arabic_calligraphy/ ), 
  it seems like it 's integral in greek alphabet , rather than just translated . 
  so in arabic , the english word egypt is \u0627\u064a\u0686\u0628\u062a ( i think ) , which is essentially just e-g-y-p-t , while the actual word is the translation . 
  basically what i 'm saying is the greek one seems to be just a different alphabet , rather than a translation . 
  i keep taking a minute to remember that israel is n't european . 
  damn eurovision and european championships !, 
  most still have them , they just are n't used . 
  yeah i get that , but frenchman , irishman , canadien , are all valid words , i just assumed there would be one for swiss people in english . 
  someone else mentioned that , and explained why . 
  i wo n't argue with you , you 'd know better than me , it 's just what he was saying . 
  italian is similar , svizzero -  svizzeri . 
  i do n't think that 'd really work in english , swiss -  swisses did n't seem right . 
  i just presumed there would be an equivalent to the likes of german or frenchman . 
  there 's nothing like germans , or frenchmen , or the like in english ? 
  not arguing the point , just explaining what he meant . 
  did n't realise that about / de , but it makes sense . 
  and northern ireland 's which i think is the one of if northern ireland and scotland left the uk and joined the republic of ireland , and created the ** c ** eltic ** u ** nion for ** n ** ational ** t ** rade and ** s ** overeignty, 
  germans , austrians , and svizzeri ( i do n't know the english equivalent for people from switzerland ) do n't typically use r/germany , r/austria or r/switzerland , they primarily use r/de . 
  it looks a bit like a stylised lauburu which would have been good if you 'd chosen to do the basque country . 
  i 'm not sure it 's as extreme as the swastika for germany , but i agree with your sentiment . 
  surely that 'd be the ottoman not turkish ? 
   paying for the services of one ? 
  being one ? 
  yes . 
  we do n't , and are not permitted by the ethical rules of any country with which i 'm familiar , accept tips . 
  i was being facetious there , it was just to illustrate a point . 
   please explain . 
  surely you have internet and/or television service at your home . 
  occasionally there may be service problems that require a technician be dispatched to repair your systems , no ? 
  i do have those services , but genuinely , issues that occur here are generally not dealt with at the consumers end , except in installation instances . 
   if people are good , they should get bonuses or raises , not tips . 
  i agree with that , however i always view tips as a small bonus , similar to commission . 
  not always necessary , but when deserved , should be given . 
  is having a lawyer an everyday occurrence where you 're from ? 
  the closest i 've ever been to spending time with a lawyer was my ex when she studied law . 
  in theory though , if a lawyer helped me beat a murder charge when i did it , yeah i 'd tip him . 
  i do n't have a cable repair guy , that 's not a thing here . 
  in theory though , yeah if my cable repair guy said he 'd be there to fix it at 1pm and it 'd take an hour , and turned up at 1pm on the dot , and only took half an hour , plus gave me a number to call if it went out again ? 
  yeah i 'd tip him . 
  if someone provides exceptional service , it 's fine to tip them if possible . 
  if it 's not possible , you speak to their manager , and ask that they are properly rewarded for it . 
  actually do that anyway , regardless of whether you can tip them or not . 
  oh absolutely , i do both . 
  it 's because you 've gone out of your way to tip small . 
  for example , if you had a bill of 4,87 $ , and paid with a 5 $ note and left the 13 cents , that is less `` charity case '' seeming than deliberately fishing out a single euro . 
  at least that 's how i always felt . 
  in america i was once chased after , and yelled at , by a waiter for not leaving a tip . 
  i would n't say never . 
  if they provide exceptional service , i would say a tip is fine , but i employ that with everyone . 
  for the most part , i agree . 
  i do n't know specifically about germany , but in many places they are n't guaranteed by law , while they are for marriage . 
  until last year in the us , i think , military pensions , for example , did n't get paid to life partners because a civil partnership was n't the same as a marriage . 
  if my wife died , i 'd be allowed a certain amount of time off to deal with everything , and my company can allow extra . 
  a life partner is n't covered the same way , and while your company may give you time off , they do n't have to . 
  custody is the real fucky one . 
  if sue and mel are a couple , and have a child by ivf , with sue as the bioreactor . 
  in a civil partnership , upon her death , mel does n't automatically get to keep the kid . 
  i do n't know for sure , but generally , time off for partners death , financial aid , tax breaks , pensions , child custody . 
  italy is the reason scooters have the throttle in the handlebars . 
  you ca n't kick cars if you need your foot to accelerate . 
  the title might read as though it 's some special thing , as opposed to being what it 's for ? 
  that 's all i can think of . 
  he 's actually quite closely aligned with the greens in his opinion . 
  the eu is a good thing , but it needs fixed . 
  supposedly he was in favour of staying in , and improving it , but because the people want out , that 's what he 'd do . 
  you know who i think are the absolute worst at prides ? 
  straight , ( primarily ) white , teenaged girls . 
  sorta 14-16 year old ? 
  they say they 're going to be progressive , actually just going to get drunk on cheap cider and alcopops, 
  the germans actually have quite a good sense of humour , no matter what comedy has said for years, 
  refers to the nitty gritty shit that 's important but often overlooked , such as the brass tacks used in furniture making . 
  not the same guy , but i 'm on 3 , and i get unlimited 4g and texts , and 600 any network calls and 2000 3 to 3 minutes for about 28 $ . 
  i can also use it for free in australia , the us and a bunch of others and they 're adding brazil and a few others later this month , although it only lets me use 12gb of data a month while there , as opposed to the unlimited back home . 
  i do n't like talking about companies on reddit , for fear of the shill comments , but 3 are by far the best company i 've ever dealt with . 
  there 's about 100 fp churches in the world , with around 40 not in the uk . 
  so it exists but barely . 
  in fairness , av was trash .
