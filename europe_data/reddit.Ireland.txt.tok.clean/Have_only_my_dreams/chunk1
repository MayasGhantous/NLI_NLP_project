in irish , it would be `` sl\u00e1inte '' . 
  in english , just `` cheers '' . 
   `` the parting glass '' is an irish [ 1 ] traditional song , often sung at the end of a gathering of friends . 
  it was purportedly the most popular parting song sung in scotland before robert burns wrote `` auld lang syne '' . 
  [ 2 ] the song is particularly popular in ireland and amongst irish communities .

   let 's hear some traditional folk music from your country .

  not a restaurant but i used to work in a bar . 
   have you ever been tipped by an american i have . 
   how did you feel about it ? 
  great . 
  how else was i suppose to feel ? 
  in a nice restaurant , usually there will be a tip of around 10 % -12.5 % but tipping bartenders is exceptionally rare in ireland . 
   have you ever played for a youth football team ? 
  i played both soccer and gaelic football . 
   how close did you get to become a pro ? 
  not even remotely . 
  i 'm not sure i would fully agree with this . 
  his english is , well , fairly poor but his german is , i 'm told , excellent . 
  huh , genuinely did not know that . 
  [ he 's not fluent but fair play to him for trying to improve .

  no german ? 
  our president is trilingual ( irish , english , and spanish ) and our taoiseach is monolingual . 
  not a slang term but some older people will still refer to euros as ` pounds ' .

  in a cafe , usually just a cappuccino or an espresso . 
  on a special occasion , i might order an [ irish coffee . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_coffee ), 
  separate political parties but they 're in an electoral alliance i believe . 
  are there many nazis and communists in your country ? 
  probably the social democrats , though they 're now essentially irrelevant . 
  sinn f\u00e9in can be needlessly populist at times ( particularly their position on property tax ) but most of their policies would benefit the more marginalised which is , in my view , something to be applauded . 
  on the far-left , i have more respect for pbp than i do for solidarity whom are , in my opinion , needlessly divisive and sectarian . 
  i wish we had a strong and principled democratic socialist political party similar to that of the current british labour party under corbyn but irish labour are an utter joke . 
  ideologically , probably fine gael but i genuinely despise fianna f\u00e1il , even if they are less ideologically problematic under their current leadership . 
  they represent everything i hate about irish politics .

  in civ , korea or germany . 
   do you refer to the rest of europe as `` continentals '' like the british and irish ? 
  we do ? 
  policing issues and abortion . 
  abortion is prohibited by the eighth amendment of our constitution , and there is a campaign underway to repeal the amendment so the oireachtas ( our legislator ) can legislate for abortion . 
  it 's a very controversial topic in ireland . 
  [ a referendum on repealing the amendment is set to take place next year , although no specific date has been given . 
  ] ( https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2017/0424/869780-abortion-legislation/ ) on policing , an garda s\u00edoch\u00e1na ( our national police force ) grossly overestimated the number breath tests they had carried out and just recently accepted that 147,000 motorists had been wrongly summonsed to court for road traffic infringements after they had already paid fixed-charge notices . 
  in addition to this , there has been a myriad of corruption allegations leveled at the [ police force ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/over-50-garda%c3%ad-to-be-interviewed-in-killarney-corruption-inquiry-1.2849696 ) and issues pertaining to allegations made by whistleblowers have brought further controversy . 
  this has all been exacerbated due to the recent trial of a member of parliament . 
  i wo n't bore you with the details but members of an garda s\u00edoch\u00e1na were essentially accused of perjury . 
  it 's become something of a scandal . 
  i suppose . 
  it just feels a little strange to me . 
  very few irish people would refer to ireland as \u00c9ire ( whilst speaking english ) . 
  random ? 
  perhaps if you knew the mother than it would be fine but otherwise it would be fairly strange . 
  it 's correct but a little bizarre . 
  no one refers to japan as nihon or germany as deutschland .

  in secondary school i suppose . 
  when it comes to english , the curriculum can be quite varied in my experience . 
  most people have probably studied the works of [ seamus heaney ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seamus_heaney ) to some extent and completed a few shakespearean dramas . 
  apparently judging from other irish people itt it 's fairly popular , although i have never heard of it until now . 
  it 's not something i typically listen to . 
   what 's the story behind your username ? 
  it 's taken from a [ poem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wejeecihldq ) written by w.b yeats : ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- had i the heavens ' embroidered cloths , enwrought with golden and silver light , the blue and the dim and the dark cloths of night and light and the half light , i would spread the cloths under your feet : but i , being poor , have only my dreams ; i have spread my dreams under your feet ; tread softly because you tread on my dreams . 
  not sure i would classify sf as ` small ' . 
  they are the third largest political party after all . 
  i would broadly agree with your point but the smaller trotskyist political parties will never go into coalition with ff or fg . 
  the labour party lost a huge amount of support to sinn f\u00e9in due to their role in the fine gael led coalition government . 
  they are currently polling around 6 % or so which is quite poor , especially when one considers the fact that they have been the most dominant left-wing force in irish politics for decades . 
  the social democrats and the green party are polling around around 2-3 % which is not great either . 
  sinn f\u00e9in are the largest left-wing political party and tend to poll around 18-22 % . 
  yeah , of course . 
  english is the de facto language outside of the gaeltacht regions .

  but any lunar base will have to be constructed within the confines of the esa budget which is overseen by both the eu and the various members of the esa . 
  it would be expensive but not necessarily astronomically so . 
  but governments could still invest in both development projects and a lunar outpost . 
  the two are not mutually exclusive .
