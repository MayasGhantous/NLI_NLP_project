  it was actually from a news column earlier last year ( it must have been just prior to the release of the 2016 census ) but point noted . 
   you 're looking at single-nationality polish nationals from the 2011 census , i believe ( so excluding all the dual nationals and from 6 years ago ) can you elaborate on this ? 
  the 2011 census dealt with residents in general , both nationals and non-nationals . 
  that was the figure given for people who are ` usually resident and present in the state who speak a language other than english , irish or a sign language at home ' . 
  on your last point , one can still be fluent without speaking the language often . 
  due to the pervasiveness of the english language , this can happen more often than one would expect . 
  governments tend not to spend a huge amount on space exploration , at least not as a fraction of government spending . 
  i honestly do n't see why we ca n't continue to contribute towards development projects whilst investing in the esa . 
  i certainly do not think 25 % of ireland 's populace are fluent irish speakers . 
  furthermore , i agree that the census figures are misleading . 
  with all of that said , i still maintain my original position . 
  given the evidence , i am still of the opinion that there are more fluent irish speakers than the 119,526 polish speakers recorded in the last census . 
  irish ( man/woman/person ) - as gaeilge , it would be \u00e9ireannach . 
  no , i would still disagree with this . 
  the census figures may be misleading due to self-identification but i still believe that the amount of fluent irish speakers is greater than the 119,526 polish speakers . 
  the status of the current gaeltacht regions is another debate . 
   really , realistically , most of those 1.7 million did irish - cos they had to - for their leaving cert and are functionally not irish speakers . 
  or they 're still in school and speak irish weekly in lessons . 
  in fairness , this is just your inference . 
  the census only dealt with one question which was ` can you speak irish ? ' . 
  the degree to which those 1.7 million people are fluent in the language is unknown . 
  it 's actually those who claim to ` speak irish ' : http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/releasespublications/documents/population/2017/7._the_irish_language.pdf the second part of the question dealt with the frequency of use . 
  regardless , i would still disagree with ops assertion . 
   young people are significantly less likely to use the language than their elders . 
  in the gaeltacht or more broadly ? 
  if it 's the latter , i would disagree . 
  irish is taught poorly in schools but younger people tend to have a better grasp of the language than older people in my experience . 
  not really , there are 1,761,420 l2 irish speakers ( census figures so there is a degree of fallibility but my point still stands ) and somewhere between 20,000 to 80,000 native speakers . 
   but i would love to learn it .

  this [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gaeilge/comments/5f8cc0/why_not_duolingo_and_what_to_use_instead/ ) offers a nice introduction on some of the more useful resources for learning irish .

  god that was cringe worthy . 
  fianna f\u00e1il are currently supporting the fine gael government via a confidence and supply mechanism but they are the second largest party in d\u00e1il \u00c9ireann . 
  their leader is [ miche\u00e1l martin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miche%c3%a1l_martin ) . 
  the third largest party is sinn f\u00e9in and [ gerry adams ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerry_adams ) is , as of now , the current party leader , though there are rumors that he is expected to step down soon . 
  in which case , [ mary lou mcdonald ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mary_lou_mcdonald ) will probably be his successor .

   irish if you 're looking for recommendations , [ k\u00edla ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=renpzyr4_ao ) and [ the gloaming ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_ogwpczfwm ) are both pretty enjoyable . 
  if you 're interested in something more modern , there are a fair few covers of popular songs on youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a6__hsshw8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l969h454btw, 
  [ gaelic football too . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejvuld0shh8 ), 
  same - i genuinely did not know we had a ` national card game ' till now . 
  this is the first time i have ever heard of it to be honest . 
  twenty-one mostly . 
  no , not in ireland . 
  i love how romania incorporated traditional yodeling into their rap act . 
  it 's just really surreal . 
  edit : [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttjw_clqcuw ) it is for anyone who is curious . 
  meh , not a fan : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp3apbsljvk, 
  if you do n't mind stream-of-consciousness style writing , ` at swim two boys ' by jamie o'neill is a good read . 
  we share a common linguistic and cultural heritage . 
  both irish and g\u00e0idhlig are closely related and g\u00e0idhlig stems from the language spoken by early irish settlers who founded the gaelic kingdom of d\u00e1l riata . 
  in addition to this , a dialect of scots is spoken in the north-east of ireland predominantly due to the ulster plantation of 1609 . 
  our president recently addressed your parliament and the speech highlighted the close historical and cultural similarities between both scotland and ireland . 
  i would definitely recommend watching the speech if you have some spare time : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjo_poxzrgq, 
  stay . 
  how do you define nationalism ? 
  i would consider myself to be a nationalist in the traditional irish republican tradition but that is very different from how nationalism is viewed in , say germany , for example . 
  practically non-existent . 
  yeah , many . 
  the most notable example is probably sinn f\u00e9in but virtually all political parties support reunification . 
  right now ?

  while we 're on the topic , this german christmas ad is pretty damn good too : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6-0kyhqoro, 
  some of my personal favourites : [ give up yer aul sins ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dmok4eqybq ) - a schoolgirl , interviewed for television , tells a somewhat unconventional version of the story of john the baptist , which we see illustrated . 
  [ an ranger ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwv2d-v96dy ) - an irish soldier returns from a british military campaign to his hometown in ireland . 
  [ r\u00faba\u00ed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__rcraeidqu ) - r\u00faba\u00ed is a little girl who knows her mind -- so much so that she 's decided she 's an atheist . 
  her first holy communion is fast approaching , but the eight-year-old refuses to take part .

  she would need to have been born in ireland . 
  otherwise , you will not be eligible to apply for irish citizenship via descent . 
  if this is the case , you would need to apply for citizenship through the normal applications process . 
  here , this should help : http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving_country/irish_citizenship/irish_citizenship_through_birth_or_descent.html, 
  do you have irish parents and/or grandparents ? 
  10/10 - it 's very rare for foreigners to learn irish . 
  i would be very impressed and enthusiastic if someone from another country wanted to learn irish . 
  sinn f\u00e9in or the green party . 
  nada , does anyone ? 
  the penal codes , the centralisation of power in westminster , etc - i 'm surprised this is the point that you 're disagreeing with ? 
  the old ira were fighting a guerrilla war , as were the fenian brotherhood . 
  yes , i do . 
  i suppose authoritarian would be more apt but totalitarian would still be accurate imo . 
  or , alternatively , he is just as easily comparable with the old ira . 
  where do you draw the line ? 
  you 're not seriously comparing o'donovan rossa with osama bin fucking laden . 
  are you ? 
  please say you are n't . 
   p\u00e1draig pearse was a paedophile because ruth dudley edwards said so ? 
   blood sacrifice . 
  what about connolly , larkin , collins , etc ? 
  - the whole point of the 1916 rising was ` blood sacrifice ' . 
  it was doomed from the very beginning . 
   you are really keeping up all the bad stereotypes of the irish because i '' m not ashamed of our history and culture ?
