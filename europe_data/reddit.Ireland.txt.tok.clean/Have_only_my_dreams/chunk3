   catholic church he mentioned christianity , as would be expected considering the context . 
  edit : regardless , your assertion is clearly incorrect . 
  thousands attended the funeral of o'donovan rossa , many of whom would contribute immensely to the foundation of the irish free state and the republic . 
  to suggest that admiration for him is `` patriot bullshit imported shite from america '' is simply untrue . 
  second edit : for anyone who , you know , cares about facts : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uow-ltdlsvi, 
  yes , most european nations do . 
  the min wage was $ 9.15 an hour but it increased to $ 9.25 this year . 
  `` in a closer spiritual communion with him now than ever before , or perhaps ever again , in spiritual communion with those of his day living and dead , who suffered with him in english prisons , in communion of spirit too with our own dear comrades who suffer in english prisons to-day , and speaking on their behalf as well as our own , we pledge to ireland our love , and we pledge to english rule in ireland our hate . 
  this is a place of peace , sacred to the dead , where men should speak with all charity and with all restraint ; but i hold it a christian thing , as o'donovan rossa held it , to hate evil , to hate untruth , to hate oppression , and hating them , to strive to overthrow them . 
  our foes are strong , and wise , and wary ; but strong and wise and wary as they are , they can not undo the miracles of god , who ripens in the hearts of young men the seeds sown by the young men of a former generation . 
  and the seeds sown by the young men of '65 and '67 are coming to their miraculous ripening to-day . 
  rulers and defenders of realms had need to be wary it they would guard against such processes . 
  life springs from death , and from the graves of patriot men and women spring live nations . 
  the defenders of this realm have worked well in secret and in the open . 
  they think that they have pacified ireland . 
  they think that they have purchased half of us , and intimidated the other half . 
  they think that they have foreseen everything . 
  they think that they have provided against everything ; but the fools , the fools , the fools !, 
  they have left us our fenian dead , and while ireland holds these graves , ireland unfree shall never be at peace . '', 
  in what way ? 
  nothing you have said negates my underlying point . 
  stooping to racist insults only makes you appear petty . 
  context is important . 
  this was a man who grew up during the great famine . 
  he used whatever disposal was at his means to overthrow a foreign totalitarian government . 
  he was a patriot , as were the members of the irish republican brotherhood for that matter .

   they have some form of celtic culture , but the amount of people who speak scots gaelic or irish gaelic is minuscule . 
  you 're wrong . 
  there are 140,000 native irish speakers and 1,777,437 secondary learners . 
  there are issues regarding how the language is taught in secondary school but the language is faring much better than you 're implying , thankfully . 
  just going to repost my comment from the last thread in / r/europe : very positive - i personally think there should be some mechanism that would speed up the process so scotland could join the eu as swiftly and as easily as possible . 
   p.s. 
  pretty good , i suppose . 
  homosexuality was only decriminalised three years before i was born so societal attitudes have changed quite drastically over time . 
  legally , same-sex couples are entitled to the same rights as their heterosexual counterparts and socially , most people are fine with it . 
  being bisexual , i think most people tend to find bisexuality a bit more confusing than heterosexuality and homosexuality but generally , it has never been much of an issue .

  europe ( the continent ) would be `` an eoraip ' as gaeilge and europa ( the moon ) would just be referred to as ` europa ' . 
  yes , always . 
   ethnic cleansing is not one of the objectives of right-wing governments either for far right-wing political parties it can be and , in more cases than not , it is . 
  left-wing , i suppose . 
  both would be fucking horrible though . 
   the irish just seems to vote for someone whom they think is `` more trustworthy '' . 
   trustworthy fianna f\u00e1il is currently the largest political party in ireland ( according to polling ) . 
  they are far from trustworthy . 
   is the political left/right dichotomy in your country strong ? 
  irish politics is complicated . 
  irish politics is , well , complicated i suppose . 
  traditionally the two major political parties stem from the civil war era , with cumann na ngaedheal forming when the pro-treaty government lost the support of sinn f\u00e9in and fianna f\u00e1il forming after splitting with sinn f\u00e9in due to their policy on abstentionism . 
  the supporters of fianna f\u00e1il had traditionally opposed the anglo-irish treaty whilst the the supporters of cumann na ngaedheal ( later to develop into fine gael ) supported the anglo-irish treaty . 
  nowadays , both are relatively centre-right with fianna f\u00e1il veering more towards the centre and taking a more populist stance in general . 
  sinn f\u00e9in are , broadly speaking , considered to be more social democratic in nature and much more nationalistic . 
  additionally , the labour party , the social democrats , the green party and the aaa-pbp espouse more left-wing stances . 
  same . 
  at this stage , it has pretty much become my replacement for / r/europe .

  good luck with the lc !, 
  theobald wolfe tone 's speech during his trial : tone replied : `` i mean not to give the court any useless trouble , and wish to spare them the idle task of examining witnesses . 
  i admit all the facts alleged , and only request leave to read an address which i have prepared for this occasion . '', 
  colonel daly : `` i must warn the prisoner that , in acknowledging those facts , he admits , to his prejudice , that he has acted traitorously against his majesty . 
  is such his intention ? '', 
  tone : `` stripping this charge of the technicality of its terms , it means , i presume , by the word traitorously , that i have been found in arms against the soldiers of the king in my native country . 
  i admit this accusation in its most extended sense , and request again to explain to the court the reasons and motives of my conduct . '', 
  the court then observed they would hear his address , provided he kept himself within the bounds of moderation . 
  tone rose , and began in these words : `` mr. president and gentlemen of the court-martial , i mean not to give you the trouble of bringing judicial proof to convict me legally of having acted in hostility to the government of his britannic majesty in ireland . 
  i admit the fact . 
  from my earliest youth i have regarded the connection between great britain and ireland as the curse of the irish nation , and felt convinced that , whilst it lasted , this country could never be free nor happy . 
  my mind has been confirmed in this opinion by the experience of every succeeding year , and the conclusions which i have drawn from every fact before my eyes . 
  in consequence , i was determined to employ all the powers which my individual efforts could move , in order to separate the two countries . 
  that ireland was not able of herself to throw off the yoke , i knew ; i therefore sought for aid wherever it was to be found . 
  in honourable poverty i rejected offers which , to a man in my circumstances , might be considered highly advantageous . 
  i remained faithful to what i thought the cause of my country , and sought in the french republic an ally to rescue three millions of my countrymen from -- '' the president here interrupted the prisoner , observing that this language was neither relevant to the charge , nor such as ought to be delivered in a public court . 
  a member said it seemed calculated only to inflame the minds of a certain description of people ( the united irishmen ) , many of whom might be present , and that the court could not suffer it . 
  the judge advocate said : `` if mr. 
  tone meant this paper to be laid before his excellency in way of extenuation , it must have quite a contrary effect , if the foregoing part was suffered to remain . '', 
  the president wound up by calling on the prisoner to hesitate before proceeding further in the same strain . 
  tone then continued : `` i believe there is nothing in what remains for me to say which can give any offence ; i mean to express my feelings and gratitude towards the catholic body , in whose cause i was engaged . '', 
  president : `` that seems to have nothing to say to the charge against you , to which you are only to speak . 
  if you have anything to offer in defence or extenuation of the charge , the court will hear you , but they beg you will confine yourself to that subject . '', 
  tone : `` i shall , then , confine myself to some points relative to my connection with the french army . 
  attached to no party in the french republic -- without interest , without money , without intrigue -- the openness and integrity of my views raised me to a high and confidential rank in its armies . 
  i obtained the confidence of the executive directory , the approbation of my generals , and i will venture to add , the esteem and affection of my brave comrades . 
  when i review these circumstances , i feel a secret and internal consolation which no reverse of fortune , no sentence in the power of this court to inflict , can deprive me of , or weaken in any degree . 
  under the flag of the french republic i originally engaged with a view to save and liberate my own country . 
  for that purpose i have encountered the chances of war amongst strangers ; for that purpose i repeatedly braved the terrors of the ocean , covered , as i knew it to be , with the triumphant fleets of that power which it was my glory and my duty to oppose . 
  i have sacrificed all my views in life ; i have courted poverty ; i have left a beloved wife unprotected , and children whom i adored fatherless . 
  after such a sacrifice , in a cause which i have always considered -- conscientiously considered -- as the cause of justice and freedom , it is no great effort , at this day , to add the sacrifice of my life . 
  but i hear it said that this unfortunate country has been a prey to all sorts of horrors . 
  i sincerely lament it . 
  i beg , however , it may be remembered that i have been absent four years from ireland . 
  to me these sufferings can never be attributed . 
  i designed by fair and open war to procure the separation of the two countries . 
  for open war i was prepared , but instead of that a system of private assassination has taken place . 
  i repeat , whilst i deplore it , that it is not chargeable on me . 
  atrocities , it seems , have been committed on both sides . 
  i do not less deplore them . 
  i detest them from my heart ; and to those who know my character and sentiments i may safely appeal for the truth of this assertion ; with them i need no justification .
