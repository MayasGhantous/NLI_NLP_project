  in a case like this success is everything . 
  success , in the eyes of the vulgar , fixes its merits . 
  washington succeeded , and kosciusko failed . 
  after a combat nobly sustained -- combat which would have excited the respect and sympathy of a generous enemy -- my fate has been to become a prisoner , to the eternal disgrace of those who gave the orders . 
  i was brought here in irons like a felon . 
  i mention this for the sake of others ; for me , i am indifferent to it . 
  i am aware of the fate which awaits me , and scorn equally the tone of complaint and that of supplication . 
  as to the connection between this country and great britain , i repeat it -- all that has been imputed to me ( words , writings , and actions ) , i here deliberately avow . 
  i have spoken and acted with reflection and on principle , and am ready to meet the consequences . 
  whatever be the sentence of the court , i am prepared for it . 
  its members will surely discharge their duty -- i shall take care not to be wanting in mine . '', 
  the court having asked if he wished to make any further observation , tone : `` i wish to offer a few words relative to one single point -- the mode of punishment . 
  in france our emigrees , who stand nearly in the same situation in which i now stand before you , are condemned to be shot . 
  i ask that the court shall adjudge me the death of a soldier , and let me be shot by a platoon of grenadiers . 
  i request this indulgence rather in consideration of the uniform i wear -- the uniform of a chef de brigade in the french army -- than from any personal regard to myself . 
  in order to evince my claim to this favour , i beg that the court may take the trouble to peruse my commission and letters of service in the french army . 
  it will appear from these papers that i have not received them as a mask to cover me , but that i have been long and bona fide an officer in the french service . '', 
  judge advocate : `` you must feel that the papers you allude to will serve as undeniable proof against you . '', 
  tone : `` oh , i know they will . 
  i have already admitted the facts , and i now admit the papers as full proof of conviction . '', 
  [ the papers were then examined ; they consisted of a brevet of chef de brigade from the directory , signed by the minister of war , of a letter of service granting to him the rank of adjutant-general , and of a passport . ], 
  general loftus : `` in these papers you are designated as serving in the army of england . '', 
  tone : `` i did serve in that army , when it was commanded by buonaparte , by dessaix , and by kilmaine , who is , as i am , an irishman ; but i have also served elsewhere . '', 
  the court requested if he had anything further to observe . 
  he said that nothing more occurred to him , except that the sooner his excellency 's approbation of the sentence was obtained the better . 
  ( for a long time a section of the speech was suppressed , the court having forbade it 's reading at the trial . 
  it was not until the publication of the `` correspondence '' of lord cornwallis ( lord lieutenant in ireland at the time ) decades later that the suppressed passage came to light , in which he thanks the catholics of ireland . 
  i have included it below ) `` i have laboured to abolish the infernal spirit of religious persecution , by uniting the catholics and dissenters . 
  to the former i owe more than ever can be repaid . 
  the service i was so fortunate as to render them they rewarded munificently ; but they did more : when the public cry was raised against me -- when the friends of my youth swarmed off and left me alone -- the catholics did not desert me ; they had the virtue even to sacrifice their own interests to a rigid principle of honour ; they refused , though strongly urged , to disgrace a man who , whatever his conduct towards the government might have been , had faithfully and conscientiously discharged his duty towards them ; and in so doing , though it was in my own case , i will say they showed an instance of public virtue of which i know not whether there exists another example .

  where are you at ? 
  i 'm in dublin and it 's not too bad now . 
  although , i 'm bracing myself for the onslaught of spanish students who are going to block up the streets of dublin in the spring . 
  not often , but i did occasionally . 
  i found it a bit bizarre but it certainly did not offend me . 
  most american tourists i have met in ireland tend to be very polite imo . 
  when i was in the us last summer , one american even tried to reel off some irish phrases she learned when she was in ireland which , despite her not-so-great pronunciation , was a little endearing . 
  just a slight edit : the only time it makes me uncomfortable is if someone brings up the conflict in ni or the ira . 
  very common , mostly from north america but also from spain ( particularly spanish students for some reason ) , france , and other european countries .

  the post above was more to do with non-irish conservatives spamming irrelevant immigration posts . 
  regardless , the sub leans to the right regarding immigration . 
  holistically , it may lean to the left on certain economic issues but i would n't describe it as ` far-left ' . 
  we occasionally conduct polls during the election season and the three largest political parties tend to be fine gael , sinn f\u00e9in , and the social democrats .

   you 've given very neutral accents to be fair . 
  i mean , regarding the working class accent , perhaps ? 
  you do have stronger accents ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouxr6qg6sns ) but the upper class accent in ` what richard did ' is pretty damn strong . 
  i certainly would n't describe it as ` very neutral ' . 
  meh , i 've lived in dublin all my life . 
  people outside of dublin tend to greatly exaggerate both the posh and inner city accents ( case in point , this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee_n3g4orlk ) . 
  the links i posted tend to be more indicative of reality , rather than a caricature or stereotype . 
  there are three main dialects of the irish language ( munster irish , connacht irish , and ulster irish ) and the form of irish you speak will probably be determined by the region you grew up in ( if you grew up in a gaeltacht region that is ) or by the teacher who taught you ( most secondary and primary schools teach a standardised form similar to connacht irish nowadays ) . 
  as for english , it 's also pretty diverse . 
  in dublin , you have a distinct [ accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxk5x8tpkf8 ) associated with the ` upper class ' which is predominantly spoken in the south of dublin while there is a more ` working class ' [ accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq5u33qevgi ) spoken in the north of dublin . 
  you also have a more ` middle class ' accent spoken predominantly in the suburbs of dublin ( [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qweh9c4obac ) would probably be a decent example ) . 
  outside of dublin , distinct accents can be observed in a number of regions : northern ireland : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqsfxs8qhu8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlt_ouzw9n0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzcwawnsaty mayo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qjclvangkm cork : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yufqsbzt48w https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtu8px1rqus donegal : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4zbullogvi kerry : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulaz2i26pnc, 
  apr\u00e8s match is n't too bad but yeah , rte is shite . 
  i was mostly referring to irish comedians ( eg dara \u00d3 briain , dylan moran , etc ) . 
  pretty decent imo . 
  / r/celticunion, 
  they 're probably less of a problem down here but the continuity ira are involved in a decent amount of organised crime . 
   paramilitaries still have a lot of control in belfast and derry it 's a shame but it 's not as bad as it once was , thankfully . 
  i assume they 're mostly just involved in common criminality/drug dealing and nothing else that the psni are n't capable of dealing with . 
  that 's pretty much my main and only concern too . 
  although both loyalist and republican dissidents are worrying , right now there are n't many major problems associated with dissident gangs/paras ( outside of the standard criminality of course ) . 
  it would be a shame to see a resurgence in conflict , especially considering how far we have come . 
  hopefully we can move past the sectarian bs one of these day . 
  we 're really not that different culturally . 
  not really , unification is universally popular down here . 
  of course , there are concerns but most people favour unification . 
  i 'm of the opinion that northern ireland 's economic condition is mostly due to westminster ignoring peripheral regions of the uk . 
  in a hypothetical unification scenario , i would argue that ni would benefit in the long term despite the initial instability . 
  i personally would n't have any problems with paying higher taxes if ni was to reunify with the roi . 
  most british people have a naive and ignorant view of their role in irish history , especially regarding partition and the conflict in northern ireland . 
  slightly off topic , but that irish accent is so bizarre . 
  it begins as a posh dublin accent but then morphs into some vaguely defined rural accent . 
  it just sounds really strange . 
  northern irish is n't too bad .
