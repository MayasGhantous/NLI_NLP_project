  a little stereotypical , but a good attempt nonetheless . 
  edit : ` gay german ' is fucking hilarious . 
  i would consider it to be somewhat distasteful but honestly , i do n't really care too much . 
  it 's probably more to do with ignorance than malice . 
  i doubt most people who order the drink are well informed about the conflict .

   the rise of some competent left wing leader that can compete with merkel ( i like her , but i 'd rather have someone around equally competent that 's closer to my ideas ) . 
  the conflict in ni had little to do with religion . 
  it 's just a popular misconception . 
  probably scotland . 
  we have close historical ties with france , at least more so than most people are aware of but there are n't too many contemporary similarities imo . 
  more so in the uk than in ireland . 
  most people would identify as european in ireland so referring to people who live on the ` mainland ' as just european would be a bit unusual . 
   never heard her speak any finnish [ that 's because finnish is n't a real language . 
  ] ( http://www.sssscomic.com/comicpages/195.jpg ), 
  god no . 
   n denmark we use a term called `` kultur-kristen '' , literally meaning `` culturally-christian '' ` cultural catholicism ' - due to our history , catholicism was intertwined with both our culture and society . 
  most people still identify as catholic but would deviate from the position of the catholic church regularly . 
  most people do n't attend mass very often either , the major exceptions being christmas and easter of course . 
  i 'm not religious but i do celebrate christmas . 
  it 's mostly about family and tradition for me . 
  religion is irrelevant . 
   but i 'll use rosetta stone to learn the basics . 
  meh , try memrise or anki ( srs is pretty good for memory recall and vocab imho ) and duolingo is a nice introductory course too . 
  a good textbook will help with verb conjugation and grammar . 
  rosetta is very overpriced . 
  i would wager that it really depends on the state tho . 
  residents of rural alabama probably are n't too keen on protecting the rights and well being of lgbt people .

  [ rebellion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uethskugk4 ) - [ rebellion is a five part serial drama about the birth of modern ireland . 
  the story is told from the perspectives of a group of fictional characters who live through the political events of the 1916 easter rising . 
  lol , this is amazing . 
  a more modern author that i enjoy would be colm t\u00f3ib\u00edn . 
  scotland, 
  if russia did n't forcibly annex regions of sovereign nations to further their geopolitical goals then perhaps tensions would n't be so high . 
   how does this change your opinions on trump ? 
  it does n't . 
  at best , he is a narcissistic liar and at worst , he is unhinged , unrelentingly protectionist , and dangerous . 
  the last of us . 
  english - language of commerce , de facto second language of a decent proportion of the world , etc. 
  irish - culturally significant to me due to obvious reasons ( see flair ) , long history , beautiful music and poetry , and the most spoken celtic language in the world . 
  oh , and i think it [ sounds ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr5ys7k9el8 ) quite [ pleasant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxjvnunxhku ) too . 
  french - a beautiful language with 148 million native speakers + huge cultural and artistic significance . 
  what 's not to like ? 
  russian - very impressive literary scene ( tolstoy , pushkin , dostoyevsky , chekhov , etc ) . 
  polish - i just enjoy the way it sounds tbh . 
  [ apr\u00e8s match ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apr%c3%a8s_match ) - an irish comedy show normally screened after competitive irish soccer matches on rt\u00c9 . 
  it is performed by barry murphy , riste\u00e1rd cooper and gary cooke . 
  it grew out of barry murphy and riste\u00e1rd cooper 's frank 's euro ting sketches which first enlivened rt\u00c9 's coverage of euro '96 for which rep. of ireland had failed to qualify . 
  the show mocks famous , mostly irish , soccerstars and pundits including bill o'herlihy , eamon dunphy , johnny giles , liam brady , frank stapleton , colm murray , and graeme souness , as well as pundits from the british channels , including richard keys , andy gray , jamie redknapp , gary lineker and alan hansen . 
  they also mock irish television and radio personalities such as marian finucane , miriam o'callaghan , vincent browne , tom mcgurk , david mcwilliams , brent pope , george hook , joe duffy , pat kenny and gerry ryan . 
  as of 2010 , they have added politicians such as brian cowen , brian lenihan and joan burton to their repertoire . 
  the apr\u00e8s match team have sold out venues all over ireland including vicar street , the olympia theatre and the gaiety theatre .

  supposed to be prepping for criminal law myself but yeah , it 's not exactly going according to plan either . 
  oh , the many joys of procrastination . 
   a guy i 'm dating just went to a gay bar in krak\u00f3w with a friend ( owner of a vagina ) . 
  it bugs me that i 'm not one of these cool gaybros like him , just a nerdy sarcastic asshole without much of real friends . 
  haha , you should 've went with him . 
  have n't been to too many gay clubs myself , surprisingly enough . 
   not bad , only a little bit more friends ( irl ) could be nice yeah , i get that . 
  i used to be pretty awkward in secondary school so i kinda hung out with the same group of people and never really deviated from said people . 
  i eventually meet some great friends in college so it 's not a huge problem now but back then , i was kinda a loner i guess . 
  it can be difficult , at least more so than people care to admit . 
  i hope things work out well for you . 
   and how are you doing getting by , i suppose . 
  dealing with some personal issues but other than that , i 'm not bad . 
  babylon or korea , typically . 
  germany if i 'm going for a military victory . 
  i 'm less picky when it comes to eu . 
  / r/irishcirclejerk and / r/irishproblems, 
  irish ( english is techincally my first language ) and french, 
  define patriotism ? 
  i love my country , my language , my culture , etc. 
  with that said , i do n't really derive any personal ` pride ' from my country , at least not in the literal sense . 
  irish cinema and music are , imho , excellent . 
  in contrast , irish television is , to say the least , a tad bit dull . 
  love/hate and father ted are one of a few exceptions that come to mind but generally most irish television is rather boring , at least in my opinion . 
  irish film is great though . 
  some of my personal favourites include the following : [ calvary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgm5rq_vx4u ) [ the guard ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygva2w2qrac ) [ in bruges ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-gg2qo_l_a ) [ what richard did ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxk5x8tpkf8 ) [ song of the sea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrhoozw8of8 ) [ once ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwjiylz8vym ) [ my left foot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzluz1eonhk ) [ the magdalene sisters ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dqmxvjlmew ), 
  in my experience , only at formal occasions for the most part . 
  one kiss on the cheek and it only ever pertains to the opposite sex . 
  it 's more common with people who know each other well .
