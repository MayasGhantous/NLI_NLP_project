or whatever the dutch for `` rancid piss '' is . 
  jokes aside , i think our recent history tends to give us a different perspective on all of this when compared to a lot of western/central europe . 
  bit confused by the reaction of some parts of the east , though . 
  the simpsons analogy absolutely nails it . 
  yeah , because europe does n't know anything about carnage . 
  america has been a pacifist since it 's inception . 
  let 's do all the nations historically , shall we ? 
  it 's fun being reductionist and trying to obfuscate blatantly obvious factors on the internet . 
  i think there 's phrenological proof that we 're just natural born terrorists . 
  or was it astrological ? 
  terrorism/guerilla warfare/insurgency/revenge does n't happen in a vacuum . 
  you 'd have to be a complete moron to disregard the actions of some western powers and their contribution to the current state of the middle-east . 
  a moron or just a xenophobe who sees people fleeing a war zone as some sort of bigot christmas for shit-posting on / r/europe . 
  yeah , it 's just islam . 
  let 's ignore the decades of skull-fucking the region has gotten from certain western powers . 
  further , it makes it all the more easy to create terrorists when you keep creating power vacuums , hitting people 's families with drones and generally fucking up an entire region for years on end . 
  the crazy terrorists are n't appearing just because of a religion . 
  ah ok , a link to a 40 second facebook video posted by people called '' guerilla minds '' . 
  well , that 's all the proof i need . 
  this place is swamped with lunatics of late.i , actually , had to read the comment i replied to above three times to make sure i was n't misinterpreting it . 
  it 's equal parts hilarious and tragic . 
  tibet is under military and cultural annexation . 
  so , you can go ahead and try to make a comparison between that and taking in a few thousand refugees . 
  you can - but you 'll look the fool for trying . 
  yeah , being occupied by china ca n't be framed in the same way as being against multiculturalism . 
  that 's , flat out , ridiculous . 
   he does fight against having his homeland become multicultural . 
  that 's really not an accurate representation of the situation in tibet at all . . 
  it 's a beautiful city and country , that 's for sure . 
  cheers for the link , i 'm not a dev though so i 'll have to dig a bit deeper , 
  preaching to the choir . 
  i idly look at different european countries ( weekly ) to find the closest match to our lifestyle but with actual bloody seasons . 
  i could put up with a lot if i got to bbq in the summer and build a snowman in the winter !, 
  much opportunities for someone in it who does n't speak the language ( at least to begin with ) ? 
  you have great broadband infrastructure , good food and good looking women and ( this is important for an island dweller ) you have ** actual ** seasons ; not just varying degrees of wet and windy . 
  keeping a year old account to post xenophobic bullshit . 
  i 'm impressed . 
  ah ok , best friends again !, 
  i think you missed the second bit where i said  i ca n't blame eastern europe for welcoming it . 
  the south korean was a dictator , too . 
  only he was installed by america so you see it as a win . 
  it 's a step backwards for europe that our leaders have let happen . 
  i ca n't blame eastern europe for welcoming it . 
  thank you for your service . 
  these are some deep cuts . 
  i 'm not going to recover from this dressing down any time soon . 
  i 'm sorry that me pointing out what some of your country-men say on the internet upsets you . 
   someone from a little country would really understand . 
  sick burn ` cos usa is biiig and ireland is small . 
  you seem upset about this . 
  well for one , you can see everyone 's entire post history with a simple click . 
  i ca n't count the amount of posters ( mostly american , it seems ) on reddit who make ' lol sweden is literally africa/the middle east ' jokes and quite often get gilded and massively upvoted for it . 
   it 's supposed to be a way to keep us in touch with the existence of death and the the constant risk of it would n't one guy sitting in a chair playing russian roulette work a treat too ? 
  plenty of english descendants in ireland but you do n't , normally , hear that claimed outside of that small pocket who take flegs very seriously . 
  [ sums it up really . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umkbjlyx1v8&amp;ab_channel=marcopepito ), 
  you have to practice indulgence with the yanks . 
  treat it like a kid telling you about their invisible friend . 
  you ca n't laugh at them , it would crush them . 
   they tend to be anti-british quite often that really is a thing of the past for the vast majority of irish people . 
  unless there 's sport on . 
  i think they meant something more along the line of no more anonymity as opposed to taking classes before using a computer . 
  which is not entirely true due to the whole being burdened for many generations with a giant debt that could break us if the right dominoes fell over in the future . 
  we did n't work through anything - we tossed the crimes of the rich on to the heads of the less well off and their kids and their kids ' kids . 
  brave man quoting thatcher . 
  picks a terrorist organisation from a tiny island on the edge of europe to compare to the systemic war machine responsible for a herculean body account from the us . 
  but , well played . 
  we do n't even know if we could get a working drone program going in the next five years . 
  we 've had zero practice bombing kids and weddings . 
  and they say americans ca n't do banter . 
   give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free , the wretched refuse of your teeming shore . 
  send these , the homeless , tempest-tossed to me , i lift my lamp beside the golden door !, 
  and are symptoms not a way of figuring that out ? 
   less focus on symptoms would do us all some good i hope you would n't give that advice to a doctor . 
  work ? 
  ireland shipped off hundreds of thousands of its young abroad and still more leaving . 
  it worked like the coffin ships worked for the famine . 
  magical city bar the scum-bags hanging around the square . 
  let 's name all the things from contested academic sources that cite manuscripts from thousands of years ago . 
  and , let 's use wikipedia while we 're at it . 
  i 'm actually off to phoenicia for the holidays this year . 
  they just gave you two options . 
  your english is good so i 'm going to have to assume a blow to the head in the last few minutes . 
  those damned paddies , aye ? 
  and you point me to wikipedia translations . 
  is it too early for a drink ? 
  we 're through the looking glass now , dorothy . 
  do you want to cite a source or did you knock that up yourself ? 
  also  the earliest known use of the phrase brytish iles in the english language is dated 1577 in a work by john dee . 
  today , this name is seen by some as carrying imperialist overtones although it is still commonly used . 
   calling the irish british really no different from calling the manx , welsh , scots and english british that 's precious . 
  i commend you on finding three awesome links to back your argument . 
  they 're a little obvious , though . 
  a british ordnance blog , britannica ( people still use that ? , i think i have the old book set ) and wikipedia . . which i can show you [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_isles_naming_dispute ) from so , really want you meant to say was that it is n't controversial outside of a small number of british sources that reek of old guard mentality . 
  do n't think . 
  show me . 
  can you point me towards an official source for that ? 
  which is `` the big country '' ? 
  wales ? 
  this ** is ** confusing .
