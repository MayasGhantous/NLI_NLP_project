looks like i found the greek right wing, 
   are you suggesting that things are worse now than they were 20 + years ago ? 
  hard to say , i know there are much fewer family 's able to get by with one wage-earner over two nowadays so maybe/perhaps things are worse but since i do n't have supporting figures i ca n't say . 
   so we should kick out the multinationals then and that will improve things ? 
  no thats just daft , why would you suggest doing that unless the idea is to paint me as someone who would hold such a daft view but at the same time we should recognize that buying something that is 5 or 10 % more expensive locally but keeps the money circulating in the local economy had better macro economic benefits than buying the same item from a multinational who repatriates all their profits . 
  what i 'm talking about is an actual effort to educate people about how buying local benefits irish people and irish producers . 
  if people would just take time to educate themselves about economics and how money works it might help more people understand what it takes to build an economy . 
   what i do n't get is what on earth where people shop has to do with it . 
  especially since what you were wrong about the choice being between german or uk multinationals . 
  i am not wrong , look at the trend over the past 15/20 years . 
  increasingly in small towns everywhere small family owned businesses have been squeezed out in favor of big multinationals in industrial units out in outskirts , every small town in ireland has been victim to this in some way . 
  either you are too young to realize this or blindly think think `` competition is better '' while we hollow out all the home grown industry that ever produced something of value in the country . 
  a race to the bottom is not progress, 
  lol , forgive me for the owners of musgraves or dunnes care any less for their workers in this race to the bottom . 
  my whole point is you are not going to get anywhere in the world by having nothing to offer it besides a tax cut or `` patent box '' i 've better spelled that out in my reply to another poster here http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2l9c34/ireland_set_to_become_fastestgrowing_eu_economy/cltl2k3, 
  yep , quite a few , one of the popular tourist hotels is run by an irishman, 
  ok , so since you made your point well i 'll try and answer as well as i can in the short time i have but yea i can say ireland is not * strictly * a tax haven in the defined sense of the word but there is no point arguing that multinationals setup because of special agreements they have got with the ida or special rates they can avail of by being incorporated in ireland and also a tax haven elsewhere . 
  either way that is the reason apple came and the same reason dell left after they got a better shady tax deal offered to them by the polish government . 
   and you 'll actually note that gdp ( a measure including the profits of multinationals in ireland ) is actually growing slower than gnp , to be honest i could n't care less about gnp/gdp , both are fluff figures that are mostly buoyed by inflation and cost to do business in a country and not the real living/working standard . 
  also gnp is not a measure of `` the domestic economy '' it 's an economic statistic that includes gdp , plus any ** income earned by residents from overseas investments ** , minus income earned within the domestic economy by overseas residents . 
  while you can point to this statistic and say * `` irish people are doing well '' * i will say irish business is simply doing a bit better overseas now . 
  look i 'm am irish and i work overseas , i come home all the time and see things get worse and worse comparatively speaking for the common person , you are going to say well i 'm going on anecdotal evidence and maybe i am but imo it 's much easier to see change when you pop in and out every so often and do n't surround yourself in a culture . 
   you ca n't have a property bubble without a credit bubble . 
  it 's never happened in modern history . 
  no , no , no and no , ever bubble in history has been created by a perceived shortage in supply of a particular asset and an opinion that this asset will increase in value . 
  the same effect can indeed achieved by increasing peoples access to credit because it creates short term disparity in supply/demand since everyone with money wants to `` buy now '' look if there is one thing i know well it 's bubbles after making quite a bit in the most obvious bitcoin bubble last november and i 'm still making money by shorting the price back down until it 's in a more normal range . 
   ireland 's growth is because of ireland 's long term policies , not the policies of its current government . 
  i would call long term policy 's , investment in infrastructure , retooling and re-training , non of which i see in any great quantity in modern ireland , where are the great public works , the ardnacrusha dam 's , these are the things that make a country worth something ? . 
  any infrastructure that i do see being rolled out is wasteful , such as investing public money in water meters so it can later be privatized after the taxpayer foots the bill for infrastructure i presume . 
  the sensible thing to do there would be to just raise taxes and fix the problems instead of adding layers of useless bureaucracy and cost . 
   it will not create a property bubble but it will create a society where some people can afford houses and a lot of people can not and that is not okay in any sense . 
  ireland needs proper rent controls , `` use the land or forfeit it '' legislation and a genuine commitment from the government to end homelessness . 
  on this i agree entirely but anyone with half a brain can see ireland blindly follows everything that is wrong with the english system ( which i find rather embarrassing for a country that is supposed to supposed to have won a hard fought independence from the uk ) we have a copied legal system , now this `` patent box '' which uk introduced a few years back and now we have a capital city which rewards a landlord/nama/landowner class with 10 % a year on their investments while lower paid workers have their wages eroded by rant and mortgage hikes until they are either surviving on food banks or give up and are forced to move out of an area as it 's too expensive for them to live there anymore . 
  i realize there is probably not a lot of positive to be taken from my comment but if anything ireland needs to start working on it 's domestic economy if it does n't want to be left susceptible to global downturns , unfortunately despite what you say about ireland 's liberalised economy , i find very few benefits for me to do business there since transport , energy and living costs are still needlessly high . 
  i 've stated several times if ireland wanted to become a true technology hub it needs to embrace cheaper nuclear power as right now irish people pay stupidly high prices and proper investment in fiber optic infrastructure . 
  i 've envisioned `` green datacentres '' in ireland due to our perfect location between the us and europe but where we have good wind power there is no fiber and vice versa . 
  given the amount of pressure american tech companies are under due to nsa spying , assurances from our government that `` ireland is a data haven '' would have every international company banking on our door to do business without need for tax haven status but again progressive policy 's looking to the future is not ireland 's thing is seems and looks like iceland wants to take that datacentre niece all for itself now . 
  estonia  it startup . 
  and yea i know my own country is bad when a state only 20 years out of the soviet system can do better than it . 
  and 10 % house price inflation with no increase in wages ... yeasurewhatever.gif, 
   the economy grew by 4.3 % in the first half of the year alone yea and house price inflation was only about 10 % in dublin . 
  * no , no no property bubble to be seen here * forgive me for being skeptical , plus when does the us ever go more than 7 years without some sort of bubble bursting . 
  87  2001 dot com  2008 property  2015/2016 bond bubble / qe bubble ? 
  i 'd much rather work on a good sustainable domestic economy thanks, 
   in reality ireland is growing so fast because ; i. 
  it 's a tax ~ ~ haven ~ ~ patent box , bowing to multinational corporations for short term gain ii . 
  thanks for the most ironic and terrible future planning there is now a shortage of housing in dublin and surrounding areas fueling another property bubble , ( 10 % yearly house price inflation is a terrible thing for anyone but speculators )  there 's no way to muddy this news . 
  it 's great news and it 's because the irish people managed to get through quite a terrible time without turning to anarchy and they rightly deserve a pat on the back . 
  compared to iceland which actually reduced public and most importantly private debt through devaluation of their currency ireland it 's not doing at all well . 
  anarchy would in fact be much more preferable than seeing your state sold sold from under you , i mean just look at where the uk is headed and ireland still thinks copying the economic policy of a state that cant feed it 's people is a good idea . 
  i 'm an irish ex-pat and to be honest every time i visit there i see things going more and more backwards . 
  al hail modern ireland where if you are not buying you shopping from uk multinational it 's most likely a german one . 
  apples and oranges , are we going to discuss this story here or history, 
  it 's fair game but then you just upped the stakes . 
  i 'm bad poker player so no , i would not, 
  you are literally expecting i 've read another article in another language i am unfamiliar with and was n't even linked here and then have the audacity to call ** me ** a `` shill '' would be something if i cared but frankly i have to laugh at how all this scaremongering gets everyone worked up while i 'm sitting here in finland on the border with russia not giving two shits, 
  so now we are talking about multiple unrelated articles in a single comment thread ... okkkkkkk, 
  it was international airspace you know . . do people not even read the articles now it was in the first paragraph for crying out loud, 
  no it was not , did you even read the linked article  more than two dozen russian military aircraft , including six nuclear bombers , have conducted `` significant military manoeuvres '' ** on the edges of nato and european airspace ** in the past 24 hours , causing jets to be scrambled from eight countries as well as nato 's own baltic air policing force . 
  i think it 's you who ca n't read , dipshit . 
  how can you invade international airspace ? 
   more than two dozen russian military aircraft , including six nuclear bombers , have conducted `` significant military manoeuvres '' ** on the edges of nato and european airspace in the past 24 hours **  the most significant intercept on wednesday occurred in the north sea . 
  a force of eight russian aircraft , including four tu-95 long-range strategic nuclear bombers and four refuelling aircraft , were detected flying in formation at about 3am central european time ** flying from mainland russia over the norwegian sea . 
  so you can get shot down for simply being in international airspace these days can you ? 
  funny thing is this whole `` drama '' played out in international airspace . 
  no borders were violated but yet it 's russia 's fault for existing there, 
  ` never let a good crisis go to waste ' -- winston churchill nobody in europe expects a war but never let reality 's get in the way of a good dose of fear-mongering, 
  sorry but finland has no public support support even though the neo-liberal 's in power think they can push it on people, 
  and that is why we can not allow the media hype of terrorism to take effect . 
  people die all the time and we can not let ourselves by rules by illogical fears statistics show you are more likely to be killed by a falling tv set than a terrorist attack . 
  my grandad is turning in his grave at what pussies we 've become . 
  well yea , we know skype is back-doored and we know the us spies on it 's citizens so not much left to deduce, 
  do all your comments make zero relevance to the posts you are replying to as that 's the impression you give . 
  disappear , get mad , ? 
  are you sure this is the same person you are replying to bud ? 
  you have no relevant opinion either apart from `` look at the ignorant american statements i tend to make that are irrelevant to the conversation '' i suppose you will give me gas prices in imperial measurements too lol, 
  yea they do n't post here but 95 % of their entire post history is about defending israel or putting down palesitine, 
  reddit.com/user/ rosinthebow for starters , i have them down as claiming arabs in israel are from a totally different genetic heritage than indigenous jews and some other worrying supremacist views, 
  and like i said can you back up your statement in context of this thread `` us gas is the cheapest in the world . '', 
  like what has that even got to do with this thread ? 
  are you trying to suggest american lng gas is cheaper than pipeline gas as that really would be an uneducated statement . 
   what 's your job bro ? 
  quantity surveyor so not quite irrelevant either . 
  you forgot  every time there 's a thread that 's related to * israel * a bunch of accounts whose history is entirely devoted to to pro israeli and anti-islam messages turn up to talk out of their asses and  every time there 's a thread that 's related to * ttip * a bunch of accounts whose history is entirely devoted to pro free trade and pro big business messages turn up to talk out of their asses, 
  do n't you remember this subreddit actively punishes any talk that is not derogatory toward russia . 
  if they shout enough common sense down then the circlejerk can finally be completed . 
  i 've not seen people with hate and war fever so bad since 911 and that was frankly embarrassing now, 
   russian price gouging is happening for past 20 years , just shut it if you know nothing of local market , your opinion is irrelevant here . 
  but yet you ca n't tell me how much they are paying for this american lng can you ? 
   you have the benefit of the british nukes , without paying for them . 
  you have the benefit of nato . 
  if there ever were a war with russia , obviously many irish people would fight in the british army and they would be very welcome . 
  let 's hope it does not happen . 
  that 's geopolitics and thankfully we are using our location advantage to full effect ( neutral with protection ) . 
  do n't forget it 's in britain 's strategic interest to make sure ireland is not invaded , you might say that 's unfair or abusive but i think it 's ridiculous to expect a country to not play the cards it has to full effect which is why i 'm disappointed lithuania would not use it 's ability to import lng as leverage to reduce the price it 's paying russia for gas currently instead of paying more than they need to for american gas . 
  by the way you should note i am not arguing against this project which i see as important to securing their energy independence but i am annoyed about how they do n't seem to be maximizing it 's potential . 
   i find it crazy that lefty types in britain and ireland , who far away on safe islands with nuclear weapons please do n't pigeon hole me when you ca n't attest to my political beliefs and no we do n't have any nukes on our island thankfully nor do we have a military doctrine or alliance . 
   it is much better for lithuania if they are able to have a gas deal with a friendly ally who is a liberal democracy than a crazed one party expansionist state like russia . 
  sure it is better . . if it 's not any more expensive . 
  why not use the threat of lng imports to work russia down on price and hold it as a `` charge us competitive prices or we buy us gas card '' to me it looks like they are buying us gas out of spite and i do n't see how that can improve their already fragile relations with russia .
