   i 'm a hillary supporter eh , can i ask why ? 
  i ca n't see one good thing she has proposed apart from the fact having a vagina makes her better somehow, 
  i think he means he is vegan to the point of not being a total dick when someone makes them a meal and then they refuse it because `` muh beliefs '' being vegan is a numbers game anyway , if you avoid meat and dairy 364 days of the year but eat turkey with your family on christmas because you do n't want to be * that guy * i 'd argue you are a much greater asset to the world overall . 
  that is a great way to stand by your beliefs , i really respect peopel like you who can be a vegan on principle but not be so naive in thinking that eating a piece of cheese at a friends house compromises everything you stand for . 
  it 's a numbers game after all and all you need to do is cut down on these products . 
   here is also a great article about it . 
  holy shit dude , what happened that man is exactly what happened me over the course of the last year . 
  a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders recently over this migrint crisis as it 's become obvious many of the rational leftists like myself and others here have had the same experience and while the mods like to blame the far right and brigaiding from other racists it 's obvious to me that i 'm not alone in simply thinking the progressive left has gone nuts, 
   your country will accept ttip , mine never will . 
  is orban really against this ? 
  if so : dddddddd ca n't trickter the victor, 
  we are being very successfully thought to hate down and not up . 
  unfortunately people are just as brainwashed regarding wealth and think it 's a totally acceptable state of affairs that 1 % own more than 50 % of the wealth in the west . 
   `` we have to put immigrant quotas ** and accept ttip ** he said that exact statement ? 
  fuck the mind control , refugee distraction is working in that case as i 'm as anti ttip as they come . 
  on the other hand i do n't know if i agree if it will work . 
  if you get enough people annoyed about the general state of affairs they will come out and protest anyway and in larger numbers . 
  while there might not have been much much anti ttip opposition in the mainstream you can be sure the anti migrint sentiment can be hijacked into an overall anti eu/anti ttip movement to much greater effect . 
  i seen it happen in ireland , some really shitty taxes and penalty 's were imposed and people just boiled up inside until they tried to semi-privatize the water and then everyone just went mental with civil disobedience and huge protests every few weeks . 
  now nobody is paying their bills . 
  my point is it 's a good distraction but it can backfire hard too, 
   when the intolerant reach sufficient numbers , by their nature , they no longer tolerate the tolerant . 
  add to that , they tolerate them to the point where there is still plenty for everyone , if we see any sort of hard economic crash that attitude could change overnight too . 
  as a sort of left wing * economical * extremist who would simply like to do away with this form of crony capitalism we live under do n't throw us all in the same fire right away . 
  but yes i have the same problem as you describe with the pc left, 
  i should n't be getting angry at one moderators personal views i guess , everyone is allowed to post their own thought on their own time and i ` ts similarly ignorant of me to try and use their position as a tool against them airing their true beliefs . 
  at the same time at not happy with the direction political and religious discussion is going in general on this continent and subreddit . 
  do your best . 
  i just hope on the job impartially wins over personal conviction, 
  do n't forget pedophile as well . 
  who knows next they might be forcing us to say hitler had his good sides and we should n't judge him solely based on a genocide or two . 
  actually funny how it only only goes one way . 
  thank you for spelling out the obvious in this comment thread . 
  it 's scary and almost hard to believe people like the guy you are responding to are moderators of this subreddit . 
  just goes to shows the sort of climate they are trying to foster where satire and freedom to criticize is racist . 
  i almost feel myself having to self police my words because who knows maybe the thought police will take it the wrong way and delete me . 
  change that to `` welfare '' `` money '' and `` a house '' and you got a joke, 
  are n't grizzly bear 's just brown bears or do you want some sort of special status now too . 
  meanwhile panda bears are going extinct and nobody cares, 
   the `` no sex '' part is pretty scary if you think about it . 
  how can the state provide sex for the migrants ? 
  how about telling them to remember when they were a teenager and think how they solved it then . 
  jeezzz , if i only i could legitimately complain about my lack of sex when i was 16 and have someone do something about it . 
   historically in cases of mass frustration rapes became common , such as when an invading army ( comprised of all males without any access to women for long periods ) reaches a region where enemy civilian women are present . 
  again nothing a good fap ca n't fix . 
   subsidies are not actual reforms in the economy , they 're the substitute for making actual reforms . 
  good thing we have the cap then and all those amazing subsidy 's they spend to keep finnish agriculture profitable . 
  without them you would be importing everything as it would not be profitable to farm in a country with 6 months of winter, 
  i see , i wonder would be media be so willing to go back and talk to that driver about his feeling now , i doubt it . 
  * # * whiteprivilage * # * brownbearlivesmatter, 
   makes one wonder : what role does the religion play in it ? 
  i think it has much more to do with the whole emphasis and foreverness that 's put on it in ireland . 
  in ireland a wedding can involve tens of thousands and hundreds of people , compare that to germany where weddings ore often just a trip to a registry office . 
  it 's a lot easier to undo the latter option considering how much less you invested in it , to me that 's the psychology behind it and the reason i do n't want to get married . 
  if you get divorced in ireland i get the feeling you sort of let down all those people who came and bought gifts etc , i think it also leads to more unhappy marriages that should just break up . 
  ** we 're all living in amerikaaaaaaa ** in a way i almost wish i had nightmare neighbors like that just to reverse troll them, 
  i do n't understand this , what made him a hit ... the fact he was welcoming refugees despite the fact his co worker got stabbed and robbed ? 
  or were the two unrelated, 
  it 's ok she threatens to kill me for not closing the upstairs window when i go outside to smoke as well . 
  believe it not not people do n't always use words literally . 
  til , i seriously threatened to kill may partner for filling the dishwasher badly and leaving empty space . 
  i hope you do n't take everything literally and think they represent anything other than an abstract and powerful message of protest . 
  gallows were taken out and readied for bankers at occupy as well . 
  can any swedes tell is is `` tumba '' one of the more `` no-go '' areas of stockholm now ? 
  that 's a pretty good analysis but it leaves out one thing that i 've been considering lately . 
  in realpolitk terms the us rules over all because everywhere else is frankly less stable , by sitting back the us is allowing others to get involved and expose themselves and even get physical . 
  at the same time the us is puling back from being an active hegemony to a passive one under obama turkey and russia were being brought closer together . 
  russia is now bombing syria , closed turkish planes out of it 's airspace and is supporting the pkk by proxy under the new banner of the [ syrian democratic forces : ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8ypshxv.png ) which are not fighting assad 's army . 
  the us is also isolating turkey by sending weapons to this new force , will they support a kurdish state when a settlement is reached with assad ? 
  in any case turkey is set to lose big time and judging by the rhetoric in the western media which has been very negative toward the leaderships response to the bombing i would n't be surprised to see both russia and the us hedging their bets on erdo\u011fan 's departure in the near future . 
  this is geopolitical analysis , it 's not meant to be be open ended . 
  i watch all this guys videos and they are a really good perspective but should always be considered one viewpoint of many, 
  funny enough the european left is the greatest ally of putin right now as well thanks to their head in the sand stance on unlimited migration, 
  maybe states should be able to sue companies ( semi sarcastic ), 
  the usa tells everyone their account 's are insured too . 
  everyone knows in the reality of a banking crisis this means jack shit . 
  true , but after being to your country i can only confirm i was still the whitest person there . 
  irish people just do n't tan , we get burned and go back to being white again, 
  well i 'm not anyway as i bought up 100 of the old bulbs when they were still available in normal stores . 
  i hate the colour of the new bulbs, 
   ireland normally gets between 1100 and 1600 hours of sunshine each year . 
  the sunniest months are may and june . 
  during these months , sunshine duration averages between 5 and 6.5 hours per day over most of the country . 
  the extreme southeast gets most sunshine , averaging over 7 hours a day in early summer . 
  december is the dullest month , with an average daily sunshine ranging from about 1 hour in the north to almost 2 hours in the extreme southeast . 
  over the year as a whole , most areas get an average of between 3\u00a01/4 and 3\u00a03/4 hours of sunshine each day . 
  http://www.met.ie/climate-ireland/sunshine.asp even better here is a wikipedia commons map . 
  i literally come from that dark blue area https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:europe_sunshine_hours_map.png, 
   you only get vitamin d in summer and have to get through the winter with that really , but i 've been to finland and sweden in summer and they get really long hot days, 
  really , next time i get a tooth infection i 'm going to sweden for the weekend so, 
  as far as i know we are the whitest fuckers on the planet but yet we ended up with dark hair . 
  thanks to the constant cloud and rain we actually get less sunlight in winter than the nordics, 
  if you work illegally i 'd assume it 's very hard to get access to any sort of medical treatment as well, 
  but not the highest like every other category , thatsthejoke.jpeg, 
  are you going to try and compile facts about migrants and the employment rate of various ethnic groups in member states ? 
  and how about less convenient facts for example the study done in norway that shows non western migrants end up being a net drain on the state in the long term and how in finland 75 % of immigrants from iraq are receiving unemployment benefits . 
  regarding norway the cost of immigration is as follows - western + 800 000 nok - eastern european - 800 000 nok - non western - 4 100 000 nok source : http://www.hegnar.no/okonomi/artikkel325140.ece see the second link below to the pdf . 
  this is based on the following study by ssb : https://www.ssb.no/a/publikasjoner/pdf/rapp_201215/rapp_201215.pdf then there is also the social facts such as how * `` based on answers given by respondents statistically representing the views of 1156 million muslims across 38 countries , pew surveys show that 69 % , or 802 million people , are in favor of sharia as the law of the land . 
  '' * source : http://www.atheoryofus.net/islam-statistics in short i 'm always in favor of fact based arguments and would support and contribute to such a project but can you outline if this project will have any ideological bias and by that i mean , will inconvenient fact based truths be ignored ? 
  i do n't believe that 's it at all .
