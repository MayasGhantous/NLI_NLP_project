  either way delaying it could be just as risky as not delaying it , no deed to deconstruct my post to get to the message but i hope that clears it up, 
  you actually think it 's going to get better before it gets worse ? 
  more migrants , more problems , more public fatigue from even those who thought they were doing the right thing is all i foresee . 
  the image of the frustration bestowed on that naive hungarian guy having the food he was donating snatched off him happening little by little on an eu wide scale comes to mind ,, 
  that makes no sense , why would putin want them gone now for the sole purpose of making a speech ? 
  it 's probably going to syria if anywhere as the ships with previous tanks and bmp 's passed through the bosporus strait on on to syria, 
   putin ordered un out of the region that his army occuppies while he is going to deliver a speech at unga but yet according to you they have been there while `` his army '' were at war with ukraine . 
  why tell them to get out for a sincgle speech ... i 'm genuinely curious ? 
  yea and that 's the logic of a bully and invader right there . 
  you can same the same about crimea i wonder since it 's been russian longer than it 's been ukrainian and they are in no position to claim it ? 
  afaik that $ 1000 extra would also mean worse fuel economy as well which undo 's one of their strengths in that market . 
  seemingly he was a roma and using the dog to beg . 
  personally i ca n't understand taking the dog from him and see it as more of a punishment for begging but maybe some people know more . 
  is there something wrong with linking to wikipedia these days instead of contrarian meta sites ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alex_jones_ ( radio_host ), 
   in the golan heights the golan heights is not israel it 's syrian, 
  i hope the eu sues them for every penny . 
  ( that is if germany has n't taken 100 % ownership by now ) call it the refugee crisis karma train, 
  you should be flattered to have so many subjects , it 's germany i blame for playing bitch not the usa for being master, 
  man what is wrong with the media , first they make a big issue out of a bomb clock and make some kid a hero for taking apart a clock and putting in in the most suspicious case possible on the first school day after 9/11 and setting it to go off when in class . 
  then they make this guy some sort of hero for taking a dive and almost crushing his child in the process . 
  what are we supposed to believe anymore ? 
  edit : it 's not a boob clock i 'm afraid . 
  germany really has reached bond villain level in my eyes over the past year , they act all logical and smart but then just behave like a corrupt , bullying , neo liberal puppet of the usa as soon as they get the chance . 
  fuck germany and fuck the eu they are trying to build in their lack of any proud national image , they are obviously so apathetic about themselves they ca n't even get it up to put out kids anymore and have to take in any poor refugee that comes their way instead . 
  it 's pretty obvious other manufacturers are at it as well . 
  i opened a big short position on peugeot and renault expecting them and their really efficient clean 1.4 and 1.6 diesels to be caught cheating as well . 
  there is no way they can make the most efficient and clean diesels in the world and get away with it unless they discovered some technological breakthrough that vw could n't figure out ( which i doubt ), 
  it does n't work like that , when you get rid of everyone power vacuums only invite in other unwanted rodents . 
  cant we just hate on all rapists, 
   the value of goods imported by russia ** from outside the former soviet union ** tumbled 39 percent in the first eight months of this year . 
  how is that even a statistic ? 
  so we include eastern europe and so on in this ? 
  always knew germans could n't hold their beer for shit . 
   vws market share in the us is laughable at best it sure will be now and forget that `` growth potential '', 
  itt : not nearly as much sexy as i was hopeing for, 
  i wish i had dank buds with snoop dog right now but it 's not going to happen when we have millions of needy migrants to look after now and integrate as well . 
  this baby boomer generation is determined to leave their kids with nothing while simultaneously trying to save the migrants with their misplaced guilt . 
  but yet the information wont be made available to the public so we ca n't see how much they are swindling from us ... nice, 
  do n't forget about how vw is fucked in the us and most german pension funds and so on are invested in german automakers, 
  the usa is most responsible for climate change as well, 
  yes you just explained how it worked but you do not explain how it 's still a huge ( not only illegal but engineering ) issue going forward . 
  from the information i have summarized from other articles talking about the issue to achieve `` test mode '' results on the road would make the car much less fuel efficient to achieve the same result so if they do it right vw ca n't advertise their cars as fuel efficient clean diesels . 
  either way they are losing a lot of money here and i very much suspect the same will come true in europe as the new diesel regs are very strict even compared to super strict american ones . 
  it 's funny because the obvious common sense solution would be to enable the test mode when the car 's gps shows it in an urban area and disable it when on open road since diesels are responsible for respiratory problems not global warming, 
  and hiring your drivers as independent contractors who can either choose to properly declare their income or not is anti competitive as there is no way honest taxi drivers can compete with that . 
  ireland totally deregulated the taxi industry to the point you only need to pay a token fee for a licence and decals and for the same reason uber has n't really been overly successful . 
  in fact considering the fees they take you might be better off just being a regular taxi, 
  that 's not a barrier to entry and uber has standards for vehicles too . 
  what makes it cheaper is people skipping on taxes and that needs to stop . 
  downvoted for shitty moderator posting kittens for karma, 
  free market democracy did n't mean free movement of people up until very lately european states have always been homogeneous with those who come as migrants assimilating into host countries , only now does that seem to change, 
  i did n't say it was , but it is the first thing that comes to mind for 99 % of non germans . 
  liberal societies are also not realizing it was n't their liberal values that made them successful in the first place . 
   refreshing to see a politician not giving a fuck anymore of political correctness heres hoping viktor and everyone else in europe was watching the new south park, 
   if i consider the truly christian voices -- the really powerful catholic voices -- from the viewpoint of economic logic they confuse two different things . 
  for if someone gives someone else something from their personal wealth , this is not only morally right , but it will not weaken the national economy . 
  so to give someone something from my personal wealth will not cause economic problems . 
  but if instead of giving from my personal wealth , i want the state to give something -- for it to give care , welfare , jobs and benefits , and to guarantee a certain level of prosperity -- i am ruining that which is ours , and i am likewise ruining our prosperity . 
  because the state has to either raise taxes or make cuts elsewhere in the usual social , welfare , cultural or other budgets ; and the result of this is a shrinking economy . 
  so correct , orb\u00e1n 's for eu president, 
   putin does n't give a crap about political correctness as no good * leader * should . 
  pity pr dame merkel is still looking for the next scapegoat to fix her own popularity problem . 
  oh come on germany as a state is so post nationalistic it 's incredible . 
  th problem ( for them ) is the rest of the europe is n't ashamed of their nazi past and quite like out national identity , for germany everyone having none is better than their bad one . 
  euro brings only temporary happiness , then a long slow debt without the ability to devalue and print for stimulus . 
   how is that even possible ? 
  i think it might be something along the lines of polski friend left ireland so i work under his name and tax number and claim unemployment for myself or vice versa . 
  we have n't the best system for these things, 
  & gt ; be second generation slav & gt ; tfw son get drunk for the first time , two hours later squatting outside an irish bar, 
  i 'd say the polish have to be the most liked minority in ireland as well . 
   would you sacrifice 1/5th of your wage for that extra day off ? 
  if it meant less overall unemployment ( through more distributed labour demand ) and better society as a result then hell yea . 
  maintaining and securing a safe zone is not so hard , it 's only when ali jihad plants ied 's and waits to ambush convoys that things get more tricky . 
  i do n't think anyone believes the refugees are scum , most people would rather islam stayed closer to home is all and they would gladly help with that as opposed to taking everyone here if those are the only two options . 
   `` unless we 're willing to defend those safe zones on the ground , those safe zones will be quite vulnerable , '' valentino , with dartmouth university , told dw . 
  `` what will happen is more likely to be what happened to the safe zones in bosnia . 
  they were eventually overrun because they were n't adequately protected on the ground . '', 
   there 's no stomach in the west for sending in ground troops i do n't understand this attitude , to secure a safe zone for refugees i 'll bet you could find troops willing to protect it . 
  hell if i was trained i 'd be volunteering just so the refuges do n't have to come here . 
  yep , property price inflation is back in the double digits in dublin again now . 
  it 's almost like they never learn here, 
  ai n't no re-spawning from that shit, 
  sometimes pragmatic arrangements are necessary , the world is not black and white you know . 
  chances are someone will die of starvation in the next hour as well but i 'm still going to enjoy my lunch . 
   i can not get my sister to ** film her garden in kos **  no . 
  television allows the luxury of censoring faces if needed . 
  yea good luck censoring locations on a small island, 
  i did n't see the farmers voting to start a new cold war with russia and cut off one of their bigger export destinations, 
   food prices are at an all time high . 
  and it 's not the farmers making the profits . 
  in fact most cap subsidys go to big agri business and exporters . 
   the ruse worked , but after buying a fake passport in rome and traveling to sweden , mr. hagos landed in deep trouble . 
   he was arrested in august in connection with the gang rape of a swedish woman in the ludvika apartment he shared with another eritrean . 
  he was not charged , was released after a week and denied any involvement in the crime . 
  why am i not surprized, 
   a butcher you might need to check your facts there  assad graduated from the medical school of damascus university in 1988 , and started to work as a doctor in the army . 
  four years later , he attended postgraduate studies at the western eye hospital , in london , specializing in ophthalmology . 
  in 1994 anyway do n't take my word for it , syrians feel the same being that he is by and large the best of a bad situation and i there is many more sources where this came form https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srckdsyv4vu, 
  well tell me what this syrian refugee woman is talking about then as i can sure share her sentiment https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srckdsyv4vu,
