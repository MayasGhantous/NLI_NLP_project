  which is it , or do you want a default , balanced budget , and then a bailout ? 
  i simply said we would should have followed the iceland example , default on the private debt , strike a deal with the imf to fund our sovergn debt and yes let the private banking system sit in it 's own self created mess . 
  first of all if you exclude debt payments ireland would have returned to a balanced budget much faster and the recovery would be all the more stronger ... see iceland second of all there is no reason to believe not taking on the banks debt would mean we could not borrow from the imf ... again see iceland , that 's exactly what they did . 
  the boogeyman of `` we would look bad '' was just that a boogeyman, 
  eh `` running a defecit '' implied before the crisis in that it was our reckless spending that cause the crash , now i see you mean something totally different . 
  well i 'm sure you will agree since we balanced it over fiver years by simply making cuts there is no logical reason the cuts could not be implemented faster, 
  source for '' ireland was just running massive deficits '' go on please , i dare you . 
  the fucking misinformation that goes around continues to astound me , maybe you might learn something if you have to check facts for a change . 
  here 's a hint you can find historical data on `` trading economics '', 
  that sounds like a great use of already overburdened police and immigration offices time . 
  maybe if we offer them a bit more delightful austerity they will put in the extra hours for free / s, 
  this , very much this . 
  ohhh , this is getting salty . 
  eh in ireland the state wa n't bankrupt either , sure we would have had to make some swift corrections to the economy but doing in one year what we prolonged over five would be the same thing in the end anyway but minus the debt payments for someone else 's mess, 
   spitting distance of russian aircraft three meters is not spitting distance , have you ever been to an air show , these planes are capable and getting that close is more an fu than anything  american planes do n't fly with their transponders off and register flight plans when applicable . 
  say that again  russia 's defense ministry said the rc-135u was intercepted because it needed to be identified as it was flying with its transponder switched off  few days ago , a former rc-135 aircraft commander who flew the s , u , v , w , and x models , sent us an email and gave his point of view about the `` u-boat '' intercept . 
  here 's what he explained to us : `` about the rc-135u intercept last week , the absence of a transponder signal is a non-issue . 
  having flown many of these missions , we used the concept of `` see and avoid '' where the pilot flying is responsible for avoiding all traffic conflicts , much like a vfr flight plan without flight following . 
  source : http://theaviationist.com/2015/04/23/rc-135-aircraft-commander-explains/, 
  i 'm not playing the stupid game tonight, 
  yea because when roles are reversed and the us fly 's missions up on russia 's border only to be escorted away in the same manner by a fighter it 's somehow different ? 
  this is just your classic bait and switch headline and perfect example of propaganda in action . 
  why do n't you post his actual attendance record instead of media third hand garbage . 
  i would call 72 % attendance pretty good if i just had a newborn child since the elections happened http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-luke-ming-flanagan-2.html you do n't have to be physically present 100 % of the time to represent your people and i would say moreso when in opposition, 
  i would call 72 % attendance pretty good if i just had a newborn child since the elections happened ( was it just over a year ago ) . 
  i mean you do n't exactly get paternity leave but since i follow him on facebook i can tell you he is very active compared to some of our other representatives who have n't even figured out how ` the facebook ' works yet his wife has been ill as well . 
  i 'd actually love to see that list , preferably ranked, 
  eh the working classes that have been getting fucked by two successive governments in a row now, 
  i sort of agree but i think that can only start with a new party that represents real people . 
  there is too much independents because ff/fg/lab are shit , sf is toxic and then who else ? 
  that 's the real problem imo, 
  except those ( myself included ) who democratically elected him with most votes in his constituency . 
   ** we ** also have the best whisky sorry i did n't see that union jack you were flying , will await the opinion of a real scot :p i 'll bet the more patriotic ones might have a differing view, 
  to me it comes off more like brotherly love . 
  we all know they have the best whisky anyway . 
  if i wanted to hear condecending attitudes toward the scots i 'd move to the uk, 
  oh do n't get me wrong , we would have lost the war of independence too if the uk decided , what you said is right . 
  the ( actual military ) ira had only a few days supplies left . 
  the easter rising and the swift execution of all involved led to the atmosphere that created the war of independence . 
  that said the deal ( home rule and nothern ireland to remain part of the uk ) was good for britain too . 
  it allowed them to still manage affairs on the island via their proxy 's in nothern irelandthe biggest problem with the war in ireland was the fact it was a pr nightmare since there was so many influential irish in the usa . 
  actually now that i think of it the whole situation reminds me a lot like ukraine/russia right now , you have an uprising against kleptocratic rule , uk considered ireland to be in it 's sphere of influence therefore has no say in the matter , ruling class commit attrocities ( maidan shootings/croke park massacre ) , revolt happens , uk claims part of the country to protect english speakers in northern ireland , fighting continues through paramilitary forces indirectly supported by both sides . 
  but yea anyway , ireland did n't win independence via military means in my view , if anything it was continuous resistance in a time when slaughtering everyone in the name of ending a war would not be acceptable internationally and since we would n't quit it was better to give in gradually . 
  i hate to say it but knowing how most aid is wasted via kleptocracy and corruption the old colony system wa n't the worst thing in the world for africa . 
  at least they had law and order i.e the british were right on that one, 
  assuming that person had a job to begin with, 
  i think the us played us again , dumb money always piles in last and gets burned first . 
   you got pretty damn lucky . 
  well it was never our military that won independence but rather our attitude and opposition to british rule . 
  i 'd argue finishing that round of the war would only lead to more martyrdom , later a bigger uprising and an eventual united ireland , ` collins ' was n't exactly popular for taking that deal either you know and britain got a lot form the peace too in the form of a civil war between the sides who thought the deal was a sellout of a united ireland and collins own supporters , you also got a frozen conflict in the north and means to project power on the island but as i understand our history books in school have a different telling of events . 
  but i can understand how on the english side it would be spun as `` we 'll we let them have their country '' . 
  it ca n't be easy setting a precedent that would eventually lead to colonies asking for the same and the breaking up of the whole empire . 
  shiff is always right in the end and to be fair he has been saying the fed will never raise rates and when they do * then * shit will hit the fan as nobody will be able to afford the money they leveraged on bond buy backs and the likes . 
  sure he might be off by a bit but who could have thought the markets would buy excuse after excuse for not raising rates that the fed have been dishing out time after time . 
  finally it seems they may have backed themselves into a corner but i still think we will see qe4 before the bust, 
   in the article itself it says the market estimates federal interest rates hitting 1.25 pc by the end of 2016 . 
  that was the part where i literally laughed . 
  unless we see some sort of dollar crisis there is not a chance in hell of that happening . 
  also it 's going to be pretty hard to sell bonds back into the market when the lack of market to begin with was why qe happened ( to drive down rates ) global financial hubaloo part ii is only around the corner i tells you . 
  give us some credit , we defeated the global hedgemon of the day right on their doorstep using their own weapons and did n't even have an army . 
  if that does n't give you confidence i do n't know what would . 
  hell even the romans thought we were too harcore . 
  you can be opposed to general movements and shifts in society without engaging in fear mongering . 
  to me this sort of deal represents a further americanization of europe , i 'm sure others will have their own personal opinion on why they are opposed but you get my point i hope, 
  i have no problem with that , he claims to be neutral and as long as he behaves that way i can respect that . 
  in fact it might be a good idea, 
  while a mod charter is primitive at best right now i would be suggesting any article not backed by decent sources be given an analysis tag . 
  fear-mongering really is n't productive in my view and counter productive when it comes to how pro-ttip shills will characterize it and use it for character assassination, 
  shutout from r/stopttip . 
  we are starting to build a subreddit now as a repository for articles and information and a centralized hub for those opposed to ttip in case people need to organize should the democratic process fail us . 
  anyone with something to offer the sub feel free to get in contact with the mods, 
  that 's a lot of hate you seem fueled by . 
  ever hear of `` make peace not war '' ? 
   the fund contained about $ 90billion prior to the war , care to source that figure ... no ? 
  ok then ok here 's my source showing half a trillion in reserves back in 2014 http://www.cbr.ru/eng/hd_base/?prtid=mrrf_m, 
   btw iceland 's gdp currently stands at about 66 % of what it was in 2007 . 
  so does greece 's but with a fuckton more debt and eventual default on the horizon anyway . 
  anyway why should one country care about the other nations that risked their money investing in something , risk/reward exists in any investment otherwise i 'd have all my money in venezuelan bonds right now thanks to that super yield . 
   he knew the price of oil would drop . 
  ** b ** ullshit they do n't have to start a war over it and the idea that anyone * knew * the price of oil would drop is redicilous . 
  if that truly was the case the russian government could simply invest their sovereign wealth fund selling or even shorting oil futures and it would be a much better hedge than a freaking war in ukraine and they would n't lose a penny either . 
  the fact is nobody knew the oil price would drop or it would have already been priced into the futures markets . 
  show me evidence oil futures were trading below spot price before the crash last year and then maybe you have a case . 
  unfortunately so , that said i think we should be diversifying ourselves away from them if we are too reliant on one client . 
  pulling ourselves further into their orbit does n't make sense either when china has been showing plenty of interest . 
   such enthusiasm for ireland among policymakers in beijing is being encouraged by an ever-deepening engagement with china by the irish state . 
  in february 2014 , before returning home , the previous ambassador of the people 's republic of china to ireland , luo linquan , noted that nearly two-thirds of the irish cabinet had visited china during his time in dublin . 
  the department of foreign affairs plans to open a full consulate-general in hong kong in the autumn . 
  the ida recently opened a new office in beijing which has a special focus on attracting clients from china 's financial sector to ireland , and the agency plans to increase the workforce at its shanghai office . 
  with the two-way trade between the nations rising by 13.2 % in 2013 to more than $ 4.9 billion , the economic elements of the ireland-china bilateral relationship are clear . 
  http://www.thejournal.ie/readme/relationship-between-ireland-and-china-1522090-jun2014/ as they say the fact we thankfully come with no geopolitical baggage like nato or an expansionist colonial history makes us a very compatible chinese partner in europe and i hope we continue to capitalize on that . 
  putting ourselves in a subservient position to the usa is the worst thing any country could do . 
   he is saying that ukraine would be better with russia . 
  ignoring fact that they were allied with them for 25 years and how that worked out for them . 
  do you really think russia will allow ukraine to develop and grow stronger outside it 's sphere of influence , ukraine is entirely dependent on russia for it 's energy imports and they will hold that over them like a beaten housewife dependent on her husband until the day they come running home . 
  not only that but a successful ukraine is an external threat to the current autocratic kremlin rule , no matter how much media subexpression there is in russia there is no way a majority russian speaking country ( even if they did by some miracle produce a better and faster growing economy in the next decade ) can become successful with russians being aware . 
  this would mean russia was wrong , russia ca n't be wrong . 
  dan correctly believes that russia will not let this new ukraine be any sort of success without them so yea it really wo n't be any better without russia . 
   he did n't even mentioned the civilian plane does n't factor in geopolitics , mistakes happen , planes have been shot down before and never became a long lasting issue, 
   did you read the comment i was replying to ... ?
