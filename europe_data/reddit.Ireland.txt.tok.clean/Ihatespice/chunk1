well we can identify some milestones in feotus development and existence to better hash out the possibilities . 
  ** milestones ** * sperm and egg seperate [ pre-insemination ] * insemination * fusing of sperm and egg [ conception ] * first trimester * second trimester * third trimester * birth ** alternative milestones , ** * first brain cell , etc. 
  assuming the top list , the most powerful and rational arguments that can be made for birth , conception and first brain cell . 
  at birth , i think it is pretty undisputed that the baby is a human being and deserves all of the rights an adult deserves . 
  the first brain cells is another compelling milestone that can be argued for , once a being has even the smallest capacity for human level sentience you can make a very strong argument that it deserves the rights of an adult human . 
  conception is the third most compelling point that i can identify which is a milestone deserving of mention when we discuss at what point a child may deserve the rights and protections a human gets . 
  pre-conception , a sperm and egg indeed have the potential to become a human . 
  however the fundamental difference between pre-conception , and conception is that the processes of creating a human have not begun , even if coitus is happening . 
  i do n't think the moment of ejaculation is particularly good point to confer the rights to the sperm and egg because not every insemination results in conception . 
  as such it seems a weak point to confer the right to the potential human . 
  to further complicate matters not every conception results in a viable human . 
  by no means is the issue simple to discuss , or find a solution to . 
  in my personal opinion none of the systems currently in place are good solutions to the problem of balancing the rights of an unborn human , the rights of the parents , the needs and problems of societies and the when of all this is relevant . 
  an important distinction is that at current levels of technology a fertilized egg can be frozen safely and still be viable however a child can not be frozen to my knowledge for future thawing . 
  because austerity does n't work as intended . 
  not in the way it implemented . 
  austerity is n't some temporary measure you apply to fix runaway economies . 
  it is a systematic approach to keeping costs low in a government environment that should be used all the time . 
  cutting health staff is n't austerity - its short sighted . 
  theres plenty of money out there , but it needs to be put in the right places . 
  yes , the law prohibits murder and permits abortion in some places . 
  however in our discussion we were assuming that a fertalized egg was given the full legal status and rights of an adult or child at conception which means that aborting the life of that child is a criminal offense whether or not abortion is legal . 
  if we assume that a fertalized egg does not have the full rights of a child or adult then the discussion obviously changes . 
  i do n't think it is an oxymoron to violate your own bodily autonomy , in face i think the child conception is the only perfect example of being able to violate your own bodily autonomy - by taking actions that lead to another creature that is given legal protected status inhabiting your body you have essentially violated your own bodily autonomy because despite the fact that you do not want the child there , the child can not be held responsible for the actions and nor can the child be removed because it is legally protected by the state . 
  we have reached a point where a fundamental disagreement of whether the mothers actions have a part of the morality of the issue , this is a disagreement i 'm afraid we wont be able to go over but the discussion was certainly enlightening and informative for me . 
  thank you for the discussion but i 'm afraid it wont go any further as i am unsure on how to convince you that accountability does have a place in the discussion , and as such my ability to play devils advocate here has ended . 
  i would love to be able to continue the conversation but it seems we have drawn a line in the sand where you think that accountability has nothing to do with and i think it does . 
  again , the most important thing that i have n't seen you respond to is this : conceiving a child and terminating it would be a violation of that child 's bodily autonomy . 
  since you would be doing something to that child 's body without it 's ability to make a say in the matter . 
  for a similar reason that having sex with a child is immoral and illegal , they lack the capacity for consent and participation in the action , killing an unborn child is - by your own belief of body autonomy - immoral and a violation of their own body authority as they lack the capacity to be held accountable for their position , aswell as they lack the capacity to participate in the decision or consent . 
  the government actually does build social housing in a lot of places because housing is an area of the market where the market is skewed heavily towards the wealthy end of the scale as the margins are higher ( part of the reason for housijg bubbles and crashes ) . 
  source : i work in the industry . 
  the superman solution . 
  babies in tubes maaaan !, 
  they 're in bed with property developers , landowners and the construction industry . 
  lowering the value of houses would also be construed as government meddling in the free market or some shit . 
  yes it would , i think the op was trying to communicate negative as in bad feedback loop in their mind and wrote the wrong notation . 
  again , a small homogenous country of 300k is unlikely to be representative of the wider world . 
  many things are true in iceland that are not and vice versa compared to the rest of the world . 
  the fact that there is not a public debate doing on does n't mean the isdue is settled . 
  it just means there is not a public debate . 
  a woman agrees to clone herself , halfway through the cloning process she regrets the cloning and decides to kill it . 
  the clone has full legal rights and protections as a human being . 
  this is a criminal offense whether the clone is inside the womans body or not * because killing a human is illegal * . 
  the writ of law supercedes `` body authority '' due to the fact the former is , well simply put , law . 
  i make no judgements on the justness of the law . 
  a human foetus is not violating a womans bodily authority . 
  she violated that herself by exposing herself to thenrisk of concieving a child . 
  the child did not make that decision and can not be held accountable for the actions of the mother . 
  again , just because the mother does n't want a child does n't give her thenright to kill . 
  [ again just to clarify , these are not my beleifs , but arguments i have heard , and the statements i am making are in the assumption that a foetus has the full legal status of a child or adult ], 
  and i do n't think you understand the concept of consequences for actions . 
  you pull a trigger and the bullet that comes out is your responsibility for the damage it does . 
  the point is that the std was a metaphor for a child , if the std is assumed to be human and have the exact same rights as an adult then killing it is , legally speaking , murder . 
  similarly , if i engaged in behaviour the lead to the development of the std/child then i must shoulder the responsibility for that and some made up right of bodily autobomy does n't overwrite their right to existence . 
  again , if we are assuming that a foetus has the full rights of a human being then for all intents and purposes the woman put the child there with her actions and does not have the right to kill the child . 
  similarly a woman does not have the right to kill a newborn on it 's way out of her body , or a child outside her body . 
  it absolutely will never be as simple as `` her body , her rules '' when we are assuming that the child inside her is goven the exact same rights as a child outside her . 
  because she would be violating the child 's legal protections by killing it which are written into law while `` bodily autonomy '' is not . 
  body autonomy seems like a very authoritation position to take without consideration of other factors . 
  and again , it will never be that simple . 
  abortion may be legal in most of the developed world , that does not mean it is settled . 
  there are huge anti abortion movements in all countries with legalised abortion which to me soeaks to the fact ghat this is not , and may never be settled . 
   no but it ... that is a violation of the foetus ' bodily autonomy . 
   the risky beh ... 
  the behaviour is absolutely * not * irrelevant . 
  if i force myself inside you : that is a violation of your body autonomy . 
  if you expose yourself to the risk of a child developing inside your body voluntarily you have no grounds to say that the child is violating your bodily autonomy . 
  if i go around fucking people without condoms i don have grounds to say that the std is violating my bodily autonomy because i engaged in behaviour that directly lead to the situation occurring . 
  whether the person is alive and inside your body without any choice in the matter from them does matter . 
  your actiobs directly lead to the consequence of their existences and tour response is ( in the context of this conversation : given the assumption of full rights of a human for the foetus ) tantamount murder [ not my beleif ] . 
  a woman specifically goes out of her way to get pregnant , a week later she decides she does n't want to be anymore , she now magically has the right to reverse that decision for no consequences despite the fact that her behaviour directly led to the development of a new human . 
  you are being dismissive of the point and parroting `` its really simple '' when an issue that has been discussed for decades is anything but simple . 
  ok cool . 
  * listen and beleive *, 
  sigh , accidentally hit refresh and lost my reply . 
  one anecdotal example does not disprove the correlation of the two maps . 
  assault and rape are not the same as a foetus growing inside a person . 
  stealing a kidney is not the same as a foetus growing inside a person . 
  they are bad metaphors because the victims actions had absolutely no impact on the likelyhood that they would be assaulted or attack ( assuming they werent going around picking fights ) ed . 
  a womans actions have a measurable direct connection to the likelyhood of a child developing which means they have a wealth of options to mitigate thise risks . 
  and ? 
  my point still stands . 
  a foetus is not kidnapping or assaulting you . 
  it is a multi celled organism that is a consequence of a risky behaviour you engaged in . 
  you did not engage in risky behaviour that led to someone else needing a transplant . 
  the foetus is a direct result of your own actions . 
  you can not be held responsible for someone else developing a kidney problem sonce your behaviour sid not influence the development of that kidney problem . 
  its not as simple as that . 
  no matter how many times you say it , it does not make it more true . 
   and currently , birth control and abortio do not necessarily lead to sub-replacement fertility rates [ abortion legality map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/61/abortionlawsmap05.jpg ) [ total fertility rate map ] ( http://www.mapsofworld.com/thematic-maps/total_fertility_rate.jpg ) the two , are at the very least cor-related , considering nearly every country in europe ouside france , poland and ireland have tfr 's below replacement levels . 
   that wont be necessary ... whike this is true , in a fundamental sense , you have n't provided any evidence that unwillingness to give birth to children is a genetically inherited trait : nature vs nurture if you will . 
  heredity vs epigenetics . 
  there is also the fact that every woman who refuses to have a child increases the amount of children every other woman must have to keep a stable population by a small amount . 
  shirking their duty to the species if you will and handing off their workload . 
   its not a parasite ... 
  if you are willing to agree that the foetus is a human with full rights then how is the mother aborting it not a violation of the foetus 's body autonomy rights especially when no alternative is offered ? 
  the mother had full knowledge of the risks of pregnancy from sex and therefore must accept that risk and not just say `` i dont want it , it deserves to be gone '' just because you find a broken leg from rock climbing to be a violation of your body autonomy does n't mean you magically have some right to demand it disapear . 
  you went rockclimbing , broken legs are a risk associated with rockclimbing . 
  if you are unwilling to shoulder that risk then you should n't do the risky thing .
