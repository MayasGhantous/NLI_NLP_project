  it 's probably a tank for crowded beaches to hide between the masses of people with fake tan on . 
  they should have gotten you helium balloons , that way you could used them to do leprechaun impressions . 
  so , let me get this straight . 
  somehow , any future sanctions that will freeze russian assets abroad will be consolidated by the us government to pay off the us 's $ 16 trillion dollar debt ? 
  does russia even have that much assets in the us ? 
  somehow i really doubt it . 
  also , government spending increases dramatically during any major war , this would put the us into far more debt than it 's in now , putting it into a far worse position . 
  let 's not forget the fact that a ww3 scenario would likely result in nuclear exchanges . 
  such a scenario would destroy us infrastructure and economic interests . 
  to suggest that the us is pushing for ww3 to pay its debts and come out economically better than the rest of the world is just ridiculous . 
  . . life in plastic , it 's fantastic . 
  you can brush my hair ... oh ... wait , i have no hair . 
   meteoriteneinschlag is that like a traditional dish or something ? 
  if you 're going to launch a `` siege '' against government officials ( either pro-putin or anti-putin ) you 're not going to use people dressed in gear intended to just quell riots because your opponents are probably armed to the teeth . 
  ideally , you should be armed with tanks ( like in the 1993 coup attempt in russia ) .

  `` hello , dear sir , do you have a flag ? '', 
  do n't listen to media hysteria . 
  it 'll give you anxiety . 
   all wars turn into defensive wars . 
  the americans did exactly what i described to the germans and japanese . 
  we were on the defensive at first , but then we went over there , killed their family and friends , and set up an international system that benefited us . 
  not all wars , but conventional wars do often . 
  those wars may turn into defensive wars but only for one of the parties at any time , as in the example you 've given . 
  sometimes , as in ww1 , both side are more or less matched and it turns into a war of attrition , like a meat grinder , and suddenly the point of pursuing the war in the first place becomes meaningless in the face of the losses . 
  but we 're talking about ww3 here . 
  a war that would likely involve nuclear exchanges and hundreds of millions of deaths . 
  it 's not possible to defend against mass nuclear icbm attacks , or ever mrbm attacks , the technology does n't really exist yet . 
  all you can do in such a war is answer offence with offence , in this case , the war is no longer about defending your country . 
   if i was in the german army and saw the soviets baring down on my homeland , i really wouldnt care that we started the war . 
  i would fight to at the least prevent their tide of destruction from reaching my lands . 
  if we 're talking about the cold war here ( which i did n't think we were , but whatever ) , then a nuclear war would have broken out within a very sort time after a soviet invasion of west germany . 
  therefore , any conventional fighting against soviet forces would have been useless regardless and of little significance in defending west germany or western europe ; most of the troops on either side would have been killed by tactical nukes , radiation and the sheer mass of armaments on either side bearing down on each side . 
  ww3 is not intended to be won by either side , because the results would be so catastrophic that neither side would be left with anything to claim victory for . 
  for this reason , ww3 is never intended to be fought , it is intended to be avoided . 
  helicopters ( depending on the type ) could be used to monitor potential suspects on the ground or to provide rapid troop deployment in case of any eventuality ( which would be beneficial as the parade may cause traffic delays in the city , hindering response by road ) . 
  and lo and behold , the single largest ethnic demographic in the us is ... that 's right , germans !, 
  but this celebration is a little different , would n't you agree ? 
  there is no opposition to ww2 victory parades . 
   last time there was such large military presence was before expected opposition marches , not parades . 
  but would n't you agree that the parade is very politically sensitive as it involves the celebration of something very controversial . 
  the authorities could be anticipating ukrainian sympathizes or people opposed to the annexation planning something to coincide with the parade , which would merit greater security to deal with any eventuality . 
  is n't there some sort of celebration to be mark the annexation of crimea as well ? 
  if so , could n't that hardware you mention just be there to keep security during the celebration ? 
  could be something to do with this : http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russians-celebrate-u-s-wwii-vehicles-engines-victory-exhibit-n318596, 
  [ i knew it . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oshavh9hhfi ), 
  you 're are talking about a defensive war . 
  but the scenario in a ww3 type scenario is different . 
  quickly , such a war deteriorates to such an extent that there is no point using `` defence '' as a reason to justify it . 
  if ww3 broke out , there 's no point in fighting because there 's no moral burden to fight on either side as each side would have committed egregious atrocities ( especially if nukes were involved ) . 
  i think a comparison would be ww1 , where both sides were inherently immoral and fighting for the preservations of empires controlled by egotistic despotic aristocrats . 
  the only moral , righteous and rational position in that war was to be a conscientious objector to the war and/or to try one 's best to cut oneself off from the progenitors of the war on either side . 
  fighting on either side in a hypothetical ww3 scenario is both immoral and irrational . 
  a best course of action would be to take measures to encourage the end of such a war . 
  if that fails , then the best course of action would be to encourage others not to fight . 
  if that fails then the next course of action would be to gather those around you and hide and wait for the war to end to insure your own safety . 
  they probably think they 're in chechnya and that there are terrorists all around them . 
  the us military presence in europe is still far less than what it was during the cold war . 
  nobody 's interested in norn iron these days . 
  it 's a grey depressing dump .

  i 've heard `` immigrant '' being used many times to describe white people in a country other than their country of origin . 
  for example , polish immigrants in britain , or irish immigrants in canada , they 're called `` immigrants '' not `` expats '' . 
  why , because they 're going to invade the republic ... 
  why are you so anally retentive ? 
  yes , this is a circlejerk , now go away . 
  i never said it was n't illegal . 
  that 's `` a bit irish '' , as one might say . 
  tax avoidance = / = tax evasion . 
  she gave the context `` i do n't accept any indian male students '' . 
  it 's simples . 
  it does n't matter what the initial email the indian student sent was , and what question he asked . 
  he could have asked `` could you tell me why i was rejected '' or `` was i rejected because i 'm an indian male and india has a rape culture '' . 
  he could have brought rape into the discussion or she could have . 
  it does n't matter . 
  if he said something that stirred her , then she could have said that she rejected him because of his attitude . 
  she never made any comment about him as an individual , instead she stated her policy for acceptance , that she has a policy of not accepting indian male students . 
  there were two email responses from that professor to the indian student , there is no evidence that there were any others . 
  and i hardly see how the statement , `` i do n't accept any indian male students for internships '' could be taken out of context , it 's a plain and simply admission that it was n't simply because there were n't enough places . 
  here 's the first email response the indian student got from her : http://i.imgur.com/yyd1uio.png as you can see , she specifically stated :  `` unfortunately i do n't accept any indian male students for internships '' that 's a big step from later on when contacted by other people about this is in which she stated that she rejected him because she did n't have enough places in her lab .
