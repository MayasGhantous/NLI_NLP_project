  she may not have had enough places in her lab , but why did she say then that he was rejected because he was an indian male ? 
  she did a very bad job of covering up her tracks , she 's obviously lying . 
  as i said , nothing in that email is taken out of context , it 's just there , in front of our eyes to see , plain discrimination . 
  the second response to the indian student ( who i think was right in protesting ) was as follows : http://i.imgur.com/ionrott.png, 
  oh stop with your nonsense . 
  all she had to say was that she could n't accept the application because there was n't enough places in the lab . 
  instead , she * specifically stated * that she did n't accept him because he was an indian male . 
  she was simply covering up her tracks rather badly contradicting herself in the response email . 
  nothing was taken out of context , there is no misunderstanding , it 's all there in the emails . 
  it 's one thing to state that you 're rejecting someone on grounds of there not be being enough places , but it 's another thing entirely to say that you 're being rejected because of your nationality and gender . 
  it does n't matter if they 're indian or asian , anyone would have make similar complaints about this if it happened to them . 
  it 's plain discrimination , there 's no other word for it . 
  there are laws in most european countries against this sort of employment discrimination . 
   just do n't be surprised it 'll eventually hit you in the face . 
  their neutrality has worked out pretty well for them over the past 200 years . 
  next they should reintroduce wolves and genetically revived sabre-toothed tigers . 
  i 'm fully aware that you can do such manipulation . 
  however , all you need to do is contact the department at that university and see if this is really a policy . 
  it would be quite easy to verify if it 's true . 
  it 's really shocking that a science professor at a major european university fails to understand that they 're surrendering to statistical fallacy , using it to justify their blind bigotry and biases under the guise of equality . 
  india has the second largest population in the world . 
  it has over twice the population of the eu . 
  there are a huge class of poor undereducated people . 
  on account of this , there 's naturally going to be a higher number of reported incidents of rape and greater number of horrific incidents of rape . 
  now of course that 's horrific , but the proportions of rape per head of population do n't make india any more horrific than any other developing nation . 
  there were 24,923 rapes reported in india in 2012 , or 0.00001 rapes per head of population . 
  in germany , there were 7,314 rapes reported in 2009 , or 0.00009 per head of population . 
  this means that the number of reported rapes in germany is 9 times high than in india . 
  of course there are many cultural inhibitions that may prevent indian rape victims from reporting incidents . 
  however , the professor in her email specific said `` reports reach germany on a weekly basis '' . 
  in other words , she 's basing her opinions off reported incidents . 
  op , if that science professor can not understand basic statistics , then i 'd seriously question whether or not that internship was worth your time regardless . 
  but if what she said is correct -- `` currently other european associations are joining '' -- then this statistical fallacy needs to be tackled head on . 
  furthermore , surely if a country is more educated and is lifted out of poverty , surely this would lead to a decrease in incidents in crime including rape . 
  so it 's perplexing what these people think they 're going to achieve by wholesale banning indian students from getting an education in europe and then going back to india to help their own society progress . 
  apparently it involves flooding the internet with multiple different interpretations/accounts of one event , then readers are confounded and begin to form a distrust of all sources and journalism in general , then , in order make sense of the event , they just fall back on their own a priori biases and/or nationalistic tenancies . 
  well , it would conflict with ireland 's long standing policy of neutrality . 
  a european army could be a deal-breaking , if it happened i would be in favour of ireland leaving the eu . 
   since the beginning of the ceasefire , ukrainian army lost 64 men . 
  amount of wounded is normally 3-4 times higher than the amount of dead . 
  add dead civilians and dead separatists , and you will get hundreds . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , the ceasefire nearly collapsed because of rebels seized the debaltseve over two weeks ago , resulting in many deaths . 
  it seems the rebels wanted to seize debaltseve before instigating the ceasefire . 
  over the past week , has the fighting decreased , or has it not ?

   i am just saying that diplomacy with russia does n't seem to work , unless you 're ready to give up ukraine . 
  so , here you are basically saying that diplomacy with russian does not work and implying as a consequence that ( a ) the ceasefire in eastern ukraine is not going to work and will never work and ( b ) a major european war between russia and nato is inevitable . 
  there seems to be some exaggeration here . 
  is n't the ceasefire in eastern ukraine beginning to work ? 
  has n't fighting in eastern ukraine begun to decrease over the past week and both ukrainian and russian/pro-russian forces removing their heavy artillery from the front ? 
  if this is true , then how can you be so certain that diplomacy does n't and wo n't work ? 
  if this is true , would n't you think that any provocative statements make by either side ( be that from nato or russia ) would be highly detrimental to that ceasefire ? 
  the ira were more efficient at car bombing than the chechens , just saying . 
  it 's rather embarassing at this stage , all we have are a few pilatus pc-9s , which are only used for training purposes . 
  we realy on the uk raf any time these things happen . 
  i mean , there 's no reason why we ca n't buy/rent 2-3 f-16s or something . 
  do ordinary russians actually * believe * this stuff when they sit down and watch tv ? 
  or have they surpassed the point where they do n't believe what they watch on tv anymore ? 
  unless you want to live in a totalitarian state , these sort of attacks would be very difficult to stop via mass surveillance . 
  the best way to control them is to control demographics and promote cohesion , which is slightly authoritarian but a little bit better than having everyone feeling like they 're being watched all the time . 
  go away , plonker . 
  he gave the modified hitler salute and called orban a dictator in the process , implying that orban was like hitler . 
  modified hitler salute : http://albumwar2.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/36830.jpg https://youtu.be/tul91gzfge0 https://youtu.be/loefl4k_zf8 https://katana17.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/into-the-darkness-chpt-12-229.jpg, 
   and then going so far as to say he was in a meeting when he 's quite clearly in the press photo op before hand is just asinine . 
  it seems you did n't read my previous post . 
   but what is absolutely laughable is going so far as to compare juncker with hitler more wishy-washy straw manning here from you . 
  i 'm not comparing juncker to hitler , i 'm saying he used an inappropriate gesture and he was trying to imply that orban was like hitler . 
   i 've tagged you as such anyway , thanks for the discussion . 
  and i 've tagged you as a wanker . 
  good day . 
   no it 's not , where you got that from is beyond me . 
  a meeting is formal , and juncker is by all means a professional . 
  the photo op/arrival before hand is not formal in the slightest . 
  so , according to you , you 're not supposed to act formally before going into a formal meeting . 
  what a ridiculously stupid suggestion . 
   because only a fool would think a meeting starts with a photo op in front of the press . 
  a meeting starts when all members of said meeting have arrived and sat down and where the press are not present . 
  i did n't say the meeting starts with the photo-op . 
  you 're completely straw manning what i said . 
  it 's pretty fucking obviously the lines between casually behaviour and formal behaviour are n't drawn at the entrance to the meeting hall or whenever the chairman sites down and begins the meeting . 
   please dude , you 're embarrassing yourself . 
  you 're way too confident in your position . 
   they 're hardly acting like college students , they 're just having some banter outside of a professional environment ... there are in a professional environment , and if you think they 're not , then you 're an idiot . 
  if you behaved like that in the hallway of your office at work it 'd be looked down upon , especially by your boss . 
  just because you are n't sitting at your desk inside the office does n't make it acceptable . 
  christ alive . 
   no wonder no one wants to pay attention to irish politics if this is how the irish electorate expects their politicians to behave . 
  `` no smiling , no joking , no horseplay of anykind ! '' yes . 
  why would that position be unreasonable ? 
   they 're long time friends , orban regularly refers to juncker as grand duke and juncker to orban as dictator . 
  they 're making fun of each others traditions and ideology as friends do , get over it . 
  it does n't matter how they interpret these comments so much on a personal level , but it does matter when the press and the world are watching , this is why they should watch their behaviour and things they say in public because it could have diplomatic consequences . 
  it the head of the european commission calls the prime minister of a country a `` dictator '' is public , that could lead to controversy in terms of the public perception . 
   he does n't raise his hand behind the back of his head if you paid any attention ... his hand barely goes above his shoulder , and does n't go past his head at all . 
  stop shifting goalposts . 
  it 's almost exactly like the modified hitler salute and it 's pretty obvious what he was signalling , especially given the fact he used the salute while saying `` dictator '' . 
   can you see what they are doing ? 
  they are posing for the media ... this is not the meeting , the meeting happens inside when they sit down . 
  this was the politicians arriving . 
  you 're being ridiculously pedantic .
