   this sort of plan wo n't work well for europe . 
  going against the uk militarily is like trying to invade russia in winter . 
  ah now , all they need to do is to clear the channel for 6 hours . 
  russia : `` they 're singing in german ? 
  naaaaazzziiiiii !!!!!!, 
  it 's a nato/cia/german invasion !, 
  the anthem is a fourth reich/cia psy-ops operation ! '', 
  invade it , pick up where the dutch left off . 
  [ yeah ... ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/cityscape_berlin.jpg ), 
  they lie in wait like wolves , the smell of blood in their nostrils . 
  waiting , interminably waiting , and then ... 
  to enforce a no-fly zone you have to bomb targets which could shoot down aircraft enforcing the no-fly zone . 
  that 's also a tiny bit of a gimmick , the entire exterior of newgrange was only constructed in the 1970s , based on what one single archaeologist thought it * might * have looked like thousands of years ago . 
  for instance , you can see concrete slabs around the base keeping the ceiling up and asphalt added under the grass to stop water leaking in . 
  also , the entire white quartz facade is pure guess work , they do n't know if that was ever there . 
  the inside of the chamber is genuine-ish , some of the passage way was reconstructed . 
  you 'll also see lots of graffiti in the chamber because young people used to use it as a place to go for binge-drinking before it was redeveloped . 
  you 're just saying that to mask plans for a new anschluss . 
  i was charged $ 4 for a can of pepsi in a stall beside the colosseum in scorching late-july weather just so i could see a pile of ruins which were n't really that interesting come to think of it . 
   the blarney stone is just a stone , but it 's part of a really cool castle . 
  the blarney stone and blarney castle are rip-off tourist gimmicks -- you 're not even allowed to take pictures without paying , you have to buy the official pictures . 
  there are far more interesting castles just as old in ireland . 
  i 'm concerned that germans are threatening war again . 
  ireland has more grass per capita than any other country in the eu . 
  a hash-cloud . 
  i think that the management of taxes and their rates ought to remain in the hands of member states until such a time as all eu/eurozone member states are on par in terms of economic and infrastructural development . 
  a present , tax harmonisation across the entire eu is not feasible and would be to the detriment of some countries ( especially smaller countries who ca n't complete against larger well established countries ) . 
  well , at least nato propaganda posters are n't as misleading and scant on detail as russian propaganda posters : http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2014_11/242511/140310-crimea-sign-jms-1951_ac2375afdf9ce7c3b54c8f84fa8530a5.jpg, 
  so which lakes are the best to visit ? 
  obvious orchestration is obvious . 
  well , hugo boss did design nazi uniforms . 
  if putin had invaded eastern ukraine as well while he was invading crimea a couple of months ago , he might have actually gotten away with it without risking a larger war . 
  it 's kind of late now though , considering the ukrainian military is mobilised and nato activity in eastern europe has increased . 
  is no invading , is nudging border further west , no crossing border . 
  someone should submit # 43 to / r/aww . 
  london and dublin double-deckers are exactly the same -- just different colours . 
  but do n't they see he was a gaelic-irish hero ? 
  that he spoke irish and played hurling when he was younger ( setanta ) . 
  c\u00fachulainn is more a representation of the native-gaels in ulster , so he 's pretty much everything loyalists hate . 
  re : 28 why on earth is there a loyalist mural celebrating c\u00fachulainn ? 
  did n't the turkish invasion also include the ethnic cleansing of greek-cypriots from the north of cyprus ? 
  greece can into revive alexander the great and send him to moscow as russians flee in terror from mighty homosex warlord . 
   most of europe 's perhaps , certainly not the uk 's or french 's military , both of which are arguably equal to russia . 
  [ i 'm just going to leave this here . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duzrjfac-hu ), 
   i never mentioned nato , or any other military force/alliance involving european countries . 
  if such a hypothetical conflict did escalate , nato would have to get involved too . 
  either way , you 're still running a massive risk . 
  the crash site is extremely close to the russian border and therefore sending in nato to secure the site is stupid because it could spark a big war involving russia in which thousands and thousands would be killed . 
  there 's no logic in letting your emotions get the better of you without thinking about the wider consequences . 
  i 'm comparing russia 's cult of personality for putin in 2014 to hitler . 
  unless you can say that ireland also has a similar cult of personality drumming up war in 2014 then you ca n't compare anything with ireland . 
  ireland host nazis ? 
  where are you getting this tripe from ? 
  ireland stayed out of the war , yes , as did switzerland , sweden , portugal , etc. . . and besides , you 're talking about something way before the majority of irish people today were born , so whatever `` ugh , you 're irish you ca n't speak '' lark , as if irish people bear a responsibility for anything , is just not applicable . 
   [ `` do you want total war ? 
  '' , `` do you want it - if need be - more total and radical than anything we could even imagine today ? 
  '' , crowd : '' \u0414\u0430aaa !, 
  '' , `` now people rise up and let the storm break loose !, 
  '' , crowd : '' \u0414\u0430aaaaaaa !, 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5frhv3ukine ), 
  i think these people are just trying to act stereotypically russian so that russians might accept them more if east ukraine becomes part of russia . 
   but it is germany 's business . 
  most of the spanish public debt is owed to german banks ; it absolutely is none of germany 's business . 
  in a democracy , another country should n't be allowed to buy a say in how a country is run , that 's up to the people in that country . 
  anything else is debt-slavery . 
   spain is a trusted ally and a friend , supporting catalan independance would be nothing short of a huge slap in the face of spain . 
  maybe she should have been indifferent and kept out of something that 's none of germany 's business . 
  cut the bullshit , it was the russian who started this , it 's pretty obvious . 
  the ukrainians were sick of being treated like a russian banana republic , like kazakhstan or belarus , and got rid of their russian puppet leader . 
  then russia got pissed because their imperial domination was being questioned and started spitefully fermenting trouble in crimea and eastern ukraine . 
  russia funded and supplied unprofessional useful idiots in eastern ukraine with advanced technology they did n't know how to use properly resulting in them shooting down commercial airlines . 
  reactivate viking-mode again and throw away that liberal facade . 
  do n't give the putinbots an opportunity to call you hitler . 
  this is / r/europe , not / r/murica . 
  it was sir walter raleigh , apparently , who donated the potato to ireland , something , something . 
  in closets ? 
  oh no no , we keep ours in septic tanks . 
   follow up question : republics of europe , what would be the process of reinstating/establishing a monarchy ireland : a referendum to change the constitution . 
   in your country and ** how much support would such an initiative receive ** ? 
  ** zero !, 
  ** not even to re-establish the old gaelic high kings who existed before the normans invaded ( believe it or not , there 's a family who can trace it 's ancestry back to the last high king of ireland , rory o'connor , 800 years ago who might be eligible for the irish throne ) . 
  but the thing is , the position of high king back in those times was n't always an hereditary position . 
  well , it probably means that at least 1/3 of russians are incredibly naive and will believe anything overlord ras-putin tells them . 
  i image that the british government would have moved to canada as well as the royal family . 
  canada would have basically been in control of what remained of the british empire . 
  `` oh , but , but , neo-nazis in kiev , vodka , vodka , vodka . '', 
  whiskey  vodka . 
  ^ * diplomatic * ^ * crisis * ^ * ensues . 
  revitalise nuclear energy . 
  this is about a total eu boycott of russian goods , not just a boycott by ukrainians . 
  that would severely effect the russian economy . 
   marx and most socialists/communists . 
  except all of the former and present communist countries had/have more restrictive gun ownership laws than most european countries have today . 
  socialists/communists may support gun ownership prior to revolution , but after , nope . 
  karl marx was against gun control ? 
  * liberal brain explodes *, 
   i believe the ` westlands ' union could work , not as is , but under a reforged shared national identity , based not on tradition , but the ideas of freedom and liberty . 
  the reason i listed the resulting as federation as so fragmented was to allow all communities to co-exist . 
  you 're from northern ireland and you think a `` westlands '' union would work or even happen ?
