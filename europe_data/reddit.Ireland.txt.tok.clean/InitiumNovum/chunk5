  99 % of the ( republic of ) ireland are not for re-unification with the uk nor ever would be any time soon . 
  even ignoring nationalism , you still have logistic issues , the fact that irish issues would be democratically negated ( due to britain 's larger population and due to the fact that there are more british constituencies than irish constituencies ) . 
  you need only look at history to see how this never worked well , just take when ireland was part of the uk . 
  in westminster , it was difficult to push all irish issues in the time allocated for these to be discussed , also the fact that time was allocated to irish issues meant that there was less time to discuss issues effected other parts of the uk at that time . 
  independence made sense in that way . 
  as for your plan to re-draw the borders of europe for this hypothetical use , why ca n't you just leave the national borders the way they are now and incorporate them the way they are but as state borders inside this hypothetical use . 
  does n't that make more sense ? 
  most borders in europe up until now since the end of ww2 have stood the test of time , and messing them around again has the potential to cause a heck of a lot of problems and even unrest . 
  this is an egregiously provocative statement . 
  prepare for war . 
   let 's take the merger of the uk and ireland never !!, 
   the westlands ( taken from the etymology of the name ` ireland ) eh , that 's not the etymology of the name `` ireland '' . 
  it comes from the word '' \u00c9ire '' which in turn from the word '' \u00c9ir\u00fa '' , who was a goddess from irish mythology . 
  and if you wanted to place the uk and ireland in one eu federative state , you 'd call it the nea ( northwest european archipelago ) . 
   announcing the award in february , d\u00edaz lauded the virgin and her congregation for `` maintaining a close collaboration with police , particularly during the acts celebrated in holy week , and for sharing police values such as dedication , caring , solidarity and sacrifice '' . 
  lol . 
  but then they 'll have to upgrade wales to a kingdom in order for it to be a `` united kingdom '' . 
  but then there 's being distracting by other things on the internet when you 're supposed to be working , internet addiction , etc. . . 
  slower internet means you have to prioritise . 
  well faster internet will probably mean more people sitting around all day doing nothing , thus slowing the metabolism , thus fibre is necessary to maintain regular bowel movements . 
  fibre is good for your heart . 
  given trends towards atheism/agnosticism in the republic , if northern ireland was integrated into the republic a similar trend would likely occur on both sides of the divide in northern ireland . 
  well yeah , it 's rather disgraceful that you only know 10 welsh words and you live in a nation with the higher number of celtic language speakers . 
  even the most unlearned person in ireland would know at least a few common sentences and phrases in irish . 
  i think he/she would be riddled with pestilence , have a much higher likelihood of stis , would lack self-control , would more that likely have a drug addiction , have attachment issues and would more than likely have a tendency to negate their responsibilities . 
  i would n't touch them with a yard poll , no pun intended . 
  libertinism ( please do n't conflate this with liberalism ) is scourge on society and i will not be dissuaded from expressing my views on this issue for fear of an emotional reaction from those who defend such destructive behaviour . 
  it does n't matter in my view if you 're a man or a woman engaging in such behaviour . 
  also , i 'm not coming at this from a religious perspective , i am an atheist . 
  most of the loyalists/unionists in northern ireland are ulster scots , so they 're off the same brethren and lineage as scottish people . 
  if scotland leaves the uk , i think it 's only a matter of time before ni leaves as well . 
  soon . 
  ^ ^ seen ^ ^ as ^ ^ annexations ^ ^ have ^ ^ become ^ ^ all ^ ^ the ^ ^ rage ^ ^ lately . 
  i thought that welsh was * the * most spoken of the celtic languages , in terms of everyday use . 
  well a lot of this involved petty offensive . 
  i 've heard of people getting off for driving over the alcohol limit and stuff like that . 
  if it involved something serious like murder , they 'd probably ignore the assertion of that right or call over an irish-speaking garda , or just have the rights in irish on a piece of paper and read it out themselves . 
   neve i never saw this spelling before . 
  it 's pronounced `` neve '' sure , but the only spelling i 've seen was `` niamh '' . 
  maybe germany should revive its nuclear energy industry . 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  would n't nuclear be a good option to meet energy demands if fossil fuels from russia are cut ? 
  it 's not as dangerous as it once was . 
  statoil was hunted out of dublin a long time ago . 
  it 's rare that you 'd see a statoil garage in ireland anymore ; they used to be all over the place years ago . 
  fun fact : polish is spoken more on a daily basis in ireland than irish ( ~ 70,000 speak irish every day , ~ 100,000 speak polish everyday ) . 
  having your name in irish is actually quite common and increasingly more people are doing it . 
  if you write your name and address in irish , the irish postal service ( an post ) will deliver no problem . 
  in fact there are a lot of irish forenames which do not have an english equivalent , e.g. 
  in the republic ( i think until recently ) , if you were about to be arrested by garda\u00ed , you had the right to request your rights to be read to you in irish , and if the garda arresting you was unable to read your rights to you in irish you could not be arrested because you were entitled to have your rights read to you in either official language of your choosing . 
  i 've heard of a few crafty gaelg\u00f3irs who got off the hook because of this . 
  you could easily say that england was a victim of scottish imperialism seen as the union of the crowns happened under a scottish king , james i. 
  nazi germany made the same sort of excuses for invading poland . 
  be weary , russia today article . 
  the article puts a disproportionate amount of attention on the opinions of the svoboda party ( the neo-nazi party ) , even though they apparently only represent a tiny minority of protesters . 
  clearly , this is to make the reader think that the protesters are right-wing extremists and terrorists , when this is not the case . 
  the article also only focuses on the actions of protesters and not at all on the actions of the ukrainian police . 
  of course russia has vested interests in keeping close ties with the ukraine . 
  if the ukraine joined the eu , it could potentially lead to the ukraine joining nato , which russia really really really does not want . 
  when yanukovych took power in the ukraine , he shelved any notion of the ukraine joining nato , which is exactly the state of affairs russia is content with . 
  russia seems to still have a cold war mentality of keeping countries on it 's western borders as buffer-zones ( particularly larger countries like the ukraine and belarus , which have historically been in russia 's sphere of influence ) between itself and the west . 
  there are also the economic aspects of keeping close ties with the ukraine . 
   strong-worded resolution so basically they wrote them a strongly worded letter . 
  it reminds of [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uipsviz9nds ) . 
  what is needed is eu-wide sanctions . 
  maybe a few sanctions on russia too because they 're supporting the ukrainian regime ( and other regimes bent on despotism ) . 
  woops , sorry , i jumped the gun ( no pun intended ) . 
   1998 -- present dissident irish republican campaign it 's hardly a civil war or even `` present '' . 
  there were a few occations where the troubles in ni nearly did develop into a civil war ( in the 70s ) but it was never `` full scale '' . 
  dissident republicans are just a tiny bunch of lone nuts and their only prime activity nowadays is as `` vigilantes '' against drug gangs . 
  so is the tear gas not working ? 
  the last part of your previous post mentions concealing identity and why they might want to protect their identity in case they 're prosecuted later on , presumably even if they 're not rioting . 
  i understand this . 
  however , why would you bring a helmet for any other reason other than that you expected a riot . 
  you do n't need a helmet to conceal your identity ; you could use a scarf , mask or balaclava . 
   a riot can still emerge around you . 
  not many protests would develop into a riot , statistically . 
  if you brought a helmet to protect yourself , then you 're expecting the protest to develop into a riot . 
  why would you go to a protest , knowing that it would develop into a riot , other than to participate in the riot yourself ? 
  the point i 'm trying to make is , i do n't understand why these laws are particularly outrageous or tyrannical , as is being portrayed . 
  in a way , the laws make a degree of sense . 
  can someone tell me why the protesters got up in such a hullabaloo about laws banning people wearing helmets at protests ? 
  i mean , why would someone wear a helmet and a mask at a protest unless they wanted to start a riot ; ( a ) the helmet to protect their heads ( flying debris , rubber bullets , etc. 
  ) , ( b ) the mask to conceal their identity to lower the chance of them getting arrested later on . 
  i would 've thought that banning these sort of things at protests would prevent those who were bent on causing trouble going to a protest in the first place . 
   it 's just a matter or time before this escalates into a full blown revolution . 
  things are usually sensationalised in the media nowadays and reddit is no different . 
  it 's probably end up similar to the ukrainian orange revolution in 2004/5 . 
  `` feck '' : not to be confused with `` fuck '' . 
  `` craic '' : not to be confused with the drug . 
  it just means `` fun '' , `` what 's the craic ? '', 
  '' : pronounced `` any sh-kale ? 
  '' , it just means `` any news ? '' . 
  `` gobshite '' : a person who bullshits a lot ( [ example ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r89oerkcau ) ) . 
  `` howrya boss ? '', 
  or `` howrya horse ? 
  '' : just means `` how are you doing ? '', 
  `` arra '' : basically just means `` ah now '' , example , `` arra ted , are you not getting out of bed this morning '' . 
  in parts of the west of ireland , people say `` arra musha '' which means the same things , e.g. , `` arra musha , i forgot to turn off the immersion ! '', 
  `` plastered '' / `` locked '' / `` gee-eyed '' : dunk `` yissir '' : the third person plural `` you are '' .
