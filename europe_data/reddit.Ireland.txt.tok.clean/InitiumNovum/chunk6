  `` yous '' / `` youis '' / ye : the third person plural pronoun for `` you '' . 
  `` yous '' and `` youis '' are very common is dublin , while `` ye '' is more common in rural parts of ireland . 
  interestingly , ireland is the only english speaking country which still uses the archaic `` ye '' pronoun in everyday speech . 
  `` me auld flower '' : a phrase used a lot in dublin , especially among the older generation . 
  it 's used to address someones as `` my sweetheart '' , e.g. , `` margaret , me auld flower , what 's the craic ? '', 
   constantly tired because spain is in the wrong time zone excuses , excuses ... 
  it 's probably more to do with the warmer climate compared to northern europe . 
  in ireland , the national personification is supposed to be [ hibernia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hibernia_ ( personification ) ( a bit like [ britannia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/britannia ) for the uk , [ columbia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/columbia_ ( name ) for the usa or [ marianne ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marianne ) for france ) . 
  however , hibernia is never really used that much at all nowadays . 
  so could an earthquake off iceland below the seabed cause a tsunami to hit northwest europe ? 
  ... and cod . 
   the last poll suggested 80 % of people in roi still want a united ireland . 
  source ? 
  the majority of irish people do n't really care either way to be honest .

  libertarianism is basically a political ideology which promotes individualism . 
  nationalism , however , is an ideology which puts less emphasis on the individual and more emphasis on a collective with a common nationality/ethicity/genetic lineage and purports that one 's thoughts , ideas , actions , personality , achievements and values do not belong to solely to oneself but to a collective with a common nationality/ethnicity/genetic lineage . 
  libertarianism purports that one 's thought , ideas , actions , personality , achievements and values can belong only to oneself . 
  libertarianism rejects the idea of the social contract . 
  nationalism , however , embraces the idea of the social contract . 
  therefore , both libertarianism and nationalism are incompatible with one another . 
  nationalism is used as a political propaganda tool to promote acceptance and loyalty to a nation-state . 
  i do n't see how libertarianism and nationalism could be anything other than diametrically opposed to one another -- care to enlighten me ? 
  so all those libertarian advocates out there are stuck in perpetual adolescence ? 
  ( btw , falling for nationalistic ideals is probably a greater indication of naivety and immaturity ), 
  yes , i have been suffering from that contagion for the past few years now . 
  thus far , i have been unable to find any known cure . 
   '' ... it was accidentally struck by an american tourist . '', 
  how careless !, 
  people should always be careful about where they flap their bingo wings . 
  roll up , roll up , get your aborted cow foetuses , get 'em while they 're hot !, 
  nationalism is among the most irrational collectivist ideologies that exists alongside religion and statism . 
  we are talking about the present here , not the past . 
  is it slavery for a nun in europe in 2013 to wear a veil ? 
  if you prevent someone from wearing clothing that they choose to wear , you could also call that a form of bondage , i.e. , forcing people to conform to societal norms . 
  cases where women are genuinely forced to wear veils , headscarves , burkas , hijabs , etc. , by their parents , partners , community or state can be correctly described as slavery and it is a blatant inhibition of their liberty . 
  however , if they actually choose to wear such clothing by their own volition , then you can not describe that as slavery and preventing someone from exercising their own choice in clothing is also an inhibition of their liberty . 
  therefore , as / u/meidei mentions , banning people from wearing such articles of clothing is self-contradictory . 
  east germany did it too , just look what happened to heidi ( now andreas ) krieger . 
  or perhaps it 's a corporate state -- welfare for the corporations -- like most countries in the west . 
  though / u/hell666 is right with regards to the eu not having a free market -- corporatism , after all , can not be describes as a free market system . 
  a republic does not need to have a single head of state , nor does the head of state in a republic need to have any power at all bar signing bills into law at the discretion of the parliament . 
  come to think of it , a republic does not need to have a head of state at all -- it could be a purely parliamentary republic . 
  in the uk 's case , in a purely parliamentary republic , i do n't see why the pm would have any more political or legislative power than he/she would have at present . 
  a bill would automatically become law if it 's pasted by the majority in both the upper and lower houses and would n't need any ceremonial signature for it to officially become law . 
  alternatively , you could have the bill pass on to a supreme court after it 's passed both houses whereupon the bill 's constitutionality is scrutinised by an array of leading judges including the chief justice . 
  the supreme court would have the power to send the bill back to parliament with recommendations to insure its constitutionality .

  ironically , a lot of irish people have a secret desire to gossip about the british monarchy from time to time -- `` 800 years !, 
  ... * rabble , * * rabble , * * rabble , * ... ohhhh my god , the royal baby 's so cute , looks just like his daddy so he does , and kate still has a wonderful figure . '', 
  that sounds like a state run by an oversized central government -- ireland already has enough of that right now so i do n't see how it would benefits ireland if it re-united with britain under a common republican banner . 
  besides , british republicans are mostly communists/marxists who would probably build an even greater bureaucracy than what already exists in britain . 
  maybe if the monarchy in britain were to slip-up or do some horrible things over the next couple of years , then maybe you might see more pro-capitalist/free-market/business-minded / liberty-lovin ' republicans in britain who 'd be able to drive innovation and job creation -- but that seems very unlikely . 
  ( you mean pot calling kettle black ), 
  well , christianity never came from europe either , so ... 
  well an awful lot of jewish people did n't come from the the region that is israel today . 
  like with christianity , there were jewish missionaries at one point in time or another ( though obviously not to the same extent ) who may have converted individuals from different populations and people other than those in the region of the modern state of israel . 
  probably very little modern jews are related the to who lived israelis around the time of , say , king david . 
  also , regardless of the origin of the jews who were in europe , most of the jews in central and eastern europe did assimilate with the local populations , so they may have less in common with their historic origin . 
  if you take modern british people , it would be a fallacy to say that the average modern british person is the same , ethnically and culturally , as the britannian tribes who were around at the time of the roman invasion -- they 're been successive invasions and migrations into that region over thousands of years , this led to a patchwork of different cultures merging and assimilating with each other resulting in a brand new culture forming . 
  this same , in fact , would be true for most of europe . 
  even in ireland ( which it appears you and i are from ) , this would have also been the case -- irish people 2,000 years ago would be completely different , ethnically and culturally , to the modern irish . 
  i do n't see why jewish people would be an exception to this . 
  personally , i would n't be able to tell the difference from a jewish person who 's family came from central or eastern europe and an average central or eastern european , unless they explicitly said they were jewish . 
  well , i mean one would have assumed that , historically , the bulk of modern israelis basically settled in israel from central and eastern europe after ww2 , so invariably this would mean ( both culturally and ethnically speaking ) they are far more european . 
  i do n't understand how there could have been such a massive cultural change in the nearly 70 year since the state of israel was founded . 
  the jewish people were in europe for hundred and hundreds of years ( maybe over a thousand years in some instances ) , so invariably they did mix and assimilate a great deal with the local populations over that time -- the same would be true for any group of people who settle in a region and live for long periods of time . 
  the modern turks/anatolians are more * eastern * than they were , say , during the time of the byzantine empire because of the huge influence islam had on their culture , and , perhaps also , because of the cultural exchange and migration which would have occurred within the ottoman empire , much of which was in the middle east . 
   so what you are saying is that israel is as european as european countries such as greece , turkey , russia or romania . 
  let 's face it , modern israelis are far more european than , say , turks . 
  if turkey becomes a member of the eu , there 's no reason why it would n't be feasibly for israel to join either , but i could n't imagine israelis ever wanting to join the eu anyway . 
  looking at your comments history , you seem to have a real chip on your shoulder . 
  go away troll . 
   do n't make ** us ** get nato again guys . 
  but ireland is n't in nato . 
  people who want a united ireland generally call it `` the occupied counties/territories '' or `` the six counties '' . 
   `` when people say that they are ` irish ' [ ... ] and are against any sort of social-democratic policy etc , i get a bit annoyed . '', 
  this makes no sense . 
  ireland is a patchwork of many different political ideals and i do n't see why not supporting `` any sort of social-democratic policy '' makes you less irish . 
  your `` irishness '' is not measured by your position on the left-right political spectrum . 
  i 'm libertarian , against the welfare state and against social-democratic policies ( yes , i know , i 'm very evil ) . 
  would i be regarded as * less * irish because of this , even though i was born , raised and have spent my entire life in ireland ? 
  of course not . 
  dublin may have been founded by the vikings ( though there was a village in the location before then ) but most of the norse there fled home or were killed after desolation of the norse kingdom of dublin . 
  the name `` dublin '' is n't even a norse name , it comes from the irish `` dubh linn '' meaning `` black pool '' . 
  after the norman invasion , the region around dublin was settled by english and normans ( in a region known as `` the pale '' ) . 
  after dublin began to thrive , there was a lot of migration into the city from different parts of the country . 
  basically , ~ 80 % of the city can claim some form of gaelic irish ancestry . 
  as regard to the protestants , many are anglo-irish ( most english themselves are ethnically celts -- they only assimilated culturally with the anglo-saxons ) or ulster-scots/scottish ( not germanic ) . 
  also the normans who earlier settled in ireland did n't all become protestants during the reformation . 
  clearly sweden has one of the silliest accent : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy_yf4zz-yo it 's between the netherlands and sweden . 
   the us has capitalism deeply entrenched in this industry and is the reason most discoveries in medicine in recent years are coming mostly from europe/australia but surely capitalism would encourage the private sector to invest in scientific research if there 's a profit to be made at the end , no ? 
  i heard a story once of three irishmen who travelled to the us . 
  one day at a beach , one of the irishmen went to an ice-cream stand and order two ice-cream , one for himself and his friend . 
  then , after realizing he should have ordered third ice-cream for his other friend , he proceeded to order a `` turd ice-cream '' . 
  as you can imagine , embarrassment ensued . 
   irish is apparently the oldest written language in europe , ** if not the world ** . 
  what about ancient egyptian or sumerian ? 
  they were written down thousands of years before the celts every graced the shores of ireland . 
  also , the basque language is older than irish , so irish is not the oldest european language .
