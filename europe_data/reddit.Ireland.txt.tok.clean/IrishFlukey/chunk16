  there is no consider about it : sunday ** is ** the first day of the week . 
  monday may be the first day of the working week , but sunday is the first day of the actual week . 
  one of the common arguments is the old `` sunday is the sabbath , the seventh day , and it says so in the bible . '', 
  actually , that is not the case . 
  the bible is jewish by background . 
  the seventh day is indeed the sabbath , but remember the jewish sabbath is saturday . 
  in the old testament you all know the story of god making everything in six days and resting on the seventh day and instructing that it should be the sabbath . 
  fast forward to the new testament , to the crucifixion . 
  we are told in the bible that friday was the day of preparation , the day before the sabbath . 
  you may remember jesus was removed from the cross on friday , because they did n't want him on the cross on the sabbath . 
  did you ever wonder , having been put in the tomb on friday , why did n't the resurrection happen on saturday ? 
  the simple answer is the saturday was the sabbath , the day of rest , so he waited until sunday . 
  we are also told that the women came to the tomb on the morning of the first day of the week , and found he was risen . 
  that was sunday . 
  in honour of the resurrection , the christians moved their sabbath to sunday , but saturday is still the jewish sabbath , the seventh day . 
  so if anyone ever tells you that sunday is the seventh day and it says so in the bible , you can put them straight . 
  a lot of you wo n't go with the biblical stuff , so move to the modern day . 
  open up excel on your pc . 
  go to a blank cell , let 's just say cell a1 . 
  type in today 's date . 
  you can do it quicker by pressing the ctrl key and while holding it , press the ; key . 
  that will put in today 's date . 
  then go to another blank cell and type in = weekday ( a1 ) and when you press enter you will get a number between 1 and 7 . 
  as today is friday , the number you will get is 6 , as friday is the 6th day of the week . 
  try the same trick for any other date . 
  it is a nice one if you do n't know what day of the week you were born on . 
  put your date of birth in a1 and the other cell will tell you . 
  so there you have it : god and bill gates - who thinks he is god - both say that sunday is the first day of the week . 
  what more proof do you need ? 
  i was n't one myself , but i know some people that were there . 
  you have a great team , full of german efficiency , and what a result against brazil in the world cup . 
  you also do some strong beers - giving me my worst hangover ever !, 
  he was nearly caught too . 
  that is why he did n't give us option d. 
  yes , we still measure our beer in pints . 
  there is metric in a lot of things , but not beer !!!, 
  `` barman , could i have a litre of guinness please . '', 
  nah , it just does n't sound right . 
  you have a great football team that got its reward last year . 
  the rest of the world is holding it in reserve for blackmail purposes , just in case you ever step out of line . 
  you 've been behaving yourselves since then though . 
  true , and some people will find it hard to forgive you over your involvement in `` the sound of music '' , but you deserve another chance . 
  no , we all have our own militaries . 
  ireland has a small one , and we are a neutral country . 
  our military has excelled in peacekeeping missions in many places , such as the middle east and africa . 
  we have also been involved in the rescue missions in the mediterranean . 
  like everything about the eu , we are all different countries with different things that can not really be unified . 
  we can all work together for the common good on many things , military and other , while maintaining our independence and ways . 
  one size does not fit all . 
  we have plenty in public life , having had some as lord mayors , for example ben briscoe , and in cabinet , for example alan shatter . 
  salt and vinegar , and i would dip them in ketchup . 
  on that basis , it is really just germany and france that are important . 
  but no , the other members of the eu have their level of importance too , and the other european countries . 
  do n't put yourself down . 
  stand up tall , like your very own alps . 
  for ireland , the prices are as follows . 
  note that we now have a passport card , which is the passport in a credit card form : costs for passports depends on how you submit your application .

  britain has had involvement in ireland since 1169 , hence my 848 years reference . 
  to give a brief overview in response to your questions : in 1801 all of ireland became part of the uk , joining britain , where england , scotland and wales had been the uk since 1707 . 
  after a series of events between 1916 and 1921 , including a war of independence , a treaty was signed , whereby most of ireland became independent , except for 6 counties , which then became northern ireland . 
  so northern ireland only came into existence when the treaty was enacted in 1922 . 
  in the early 1600s many people from britain were given land in that part of ireland , which created a strong link between them down the generations to the extent that they did not want to leave the uk , as they regarded themselves as british , even about 300 years after those settlers first arrived . 
  as to leaving the eu , a majority of people in northern ireland voted to stay , as they did in scotland , but the majority in the uk as a whole voted to leave and that is why it is happening . 
  yes , but `` republic of ireland '' is officially a description , by law , whereas south or southern are informal descriptions , which sound opposite or a more distinctive term in relation to northern ireland . 
  it is south or southern with a small s . they have no basis in law . 
  so \u00c9ire or ireland are the official names ; republic of ireland is an official description , while the south of ireland and southern ireland are informal terms people use , mainly because `` northern '' exists in the name for the other part of the island . 
  the south of ireland and southern ireland are politically and geographically inaccurate . 
  whatever you use , we will agree that we are irish though . 
  yes , but it is officially recognised as being the description of the state in section 2 of the republic of ireland act of 1948 . 
  we are a republic too . 
  when someone asks me if i am from the north or the south , i say that i am from neither and that i am from the east . 
  `` the south of ireland '' or `` southern ireland '' is for me , down around cork and kerry and that general area . 
  i am from dublin . 
  as u/dmorgandub and u/raspberry _ smoothie said , the harp on a blue background is the official symbol of ireland . 
  the shamrock is an emblem , but not the official one . 
  you will see the harp on irish coins and if an envelope arrives in the post with a harp on it , you 'll know it is from the government , quite often the tax office . 
  blue , not green , is the official colour of ireland . 
  as mentioned , it is on the presidential standard , and you will find it in other places , such as the carpet in d\u00e1il \u00c9ireann , the irish parliament . 
  it is worth mentioning that \u00c9ire is the official name for ireland in the irish language and this is in the irish constitution . 
  you will see it on irish coins . 
  ireland is the official name of the country in english , while the republic of ireland is just a description rather than the official name . 
  southern ireland is not a name at all so it is incorrect politically and indeed geographically . 
  it is used as a way of distinguishing ireland from northern ireland , but otherwise has no significance . 
  geographically , northern ireland is in the northeast of the island of ireland and the most northerly point on the island of ireland is not in northern ireland . 
  have a look at a map of ireland . 
  they do n't check id in ireland like they do in the usa . 
  in the usa , you will hear of people in the 60s being asked for id before being served alcohol in bars , not because staff are not sure they are old enough to drink but because they employ a rule of asking everyone no matter what age they are . 
  in ireland though , unless you look very young , you might not be asked at all for id , particularly in the pubs . 
  if they do , they will just look at it , not scan it . 
  so it is very different to the usa in that regard . 
  you have to be 18 to be served alcohol in ireland , but if you look old enough , you might get away with it . 
  getting into night clubs is a bit stricter , and bouncers do check for id . 
  trying to buy alcohol in retail outlets is stricter too . 
  so if you look old enough , your best chance is in the pubs . 
  if you are with others that are older than you , they will be served , so they can get the drink for you . 
  even at that though , the bar staff can ask for your id if you are consuming alcohol on the premises while under 18 . 
  so be careful . 
  it 's complicated . 
  there is n't time for a lesson in 848 years of irish history .
