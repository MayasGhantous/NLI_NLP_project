  for historical reasons , we in ireland speak english , at the expense of our own language . 
  it is still alive in some parts of the country and is part of our society in other ways , like the origin of place names that are now in english . 
  it has its advantages too , with so many other countries speaking english or having people who understand english . 
  we , like the british , are not very good at learning other languages . 
  being islands , we have less exposure to other languages like many of those in the rest of europe . 
  when tourists come here , we want them to speak english to us and when we go abroad , we want people to speak english to us . 
  because people can speak english , there is less incentive for us to learn other languages . 
  we do n't have much chance to use the ones we learn , so it is only those that go to live in other countries and are exposed to other languages that actually properly learn them . 
  we have lots of them in ireland .

  there was a famous one on a morning in july 1984 in ireland . 
  i felt the bed shake briefly and laughed to myself that i had just lived through an earthquake . 
  in november 2007 i was again in bed when an earthquake happened , this time in malawi at about 3am . 
  a bit stronger but nothing to worry about . 
  some people slept through it . 
  a few months later , back in ireland , this time i was just about to go to bed when i felt a very slight tremor . 
  so i am a survivor of at least three earthquakes . 
  a few sips beforehand from my father 's pint , but on a regular basis : 17 . 
  in the irish language we just have : a \u00c1 b c d e \u00c9 f g h i \u00cd l m n o \u00d3 p r s t u \u00da, 
  not necessarily . 
  lots of people wear them . 
  of course , unless you specifically want to wear it , there is no need to . 
  maybe leave them all at home and buy some on your travels . 
  lots of places do them . 
  i never eat salmon , but i do eat fish about once a week , usually cod or whiting . 
  we in ireland call it the middle east . 
  yes , all that is true . 
  nobody packs a gun in their bag . 
  kids do n't go into schools shooting teachers and classmates . 
  our ordinary police do n't even carry guns , just a few specialised armed units . 
  we are not without gun crime , but there is n't a huge amount of it . 
  in january 2013 a policeman was shot dead . 
  that was the first time that had happened since june 1996 . 
  it is n't just the laws , but the whole culture in ireland that is different to the usa . 
  having a gun is seen as normal there and guns feature in american society in all sorts of ways , from cowboys in movies through to kids on the streets . 
  it is not like that in ireland . 
  in the usa when guns are talked about it is a case of `` the damn government is n't going to take my gun from me !!!!, 
  '' , whereas in ireland it is a case of `` why on earth would i want to have a gun ? '', 
  it is not the norm , and we are better off for it . 
  yes . 
  we have no gun culture in ireland as such , so this will affect very few people . 
  most would not even know about this . 
  it is the first i have heard of it . 
  the names we use are in the irish language . 
  people in other countries use their own languages to name their office holders . 
  they do n't use the english language for their titles . 
  english speakers may do so , but not others . 
  hosted some visiting relations last evening . 
  today will be quiet . 
  going to restaurant for sunday dinner with some family tomorrow . 
  monday is a bank holiday in ireland , so no work . 
  no great plans for it yet , but we will probably go out somewhere . 
  so all in all , a fairly quiet weekend . 
  i have epilepsy , though it is not very bad . 
  my day to day life is n't really affected . 
  one big thing is that i ca n't drive . 
  i live in the suburbs of dublin , so i have access to public transport . 
  my wife drives and i can get lifts from others sometimes too . 
  it is an inconvenience at times , but i am used to it . 
  i also walk a lot as a result . 
  epilepsy is a wide-ranging condition with many causes , forms and levels of severity . 
  `` epilepsy '' is really a catch-all term for people who have recurring seizures , rather than it being one specific condition . 
  there are a lot of misconceptions about it . 
  a classic one is that seizures are triggered by flashing lights . 
  that is only the case for one form of epilepsy and it affects only about 3 % - 5 % of all people who have epilepsy . 
  the rest of them have other triggers for their seizures . 
  epilepsy is not contagious , so you can not `` catch '' it from someone . 
  some forms can run in families , so it can be genetic , but not always . 
  it depends on the cause . 
  it is impossible to swallow your tongue , so people who have epilepsy doing so can not happen . 
  not all seizures involve people rolling around the floor or shaking violently . 
  some seizures are so quick and mild that you could be sitting beside someone having one and you might not even notice . 
  they will just seem to be day dreaming for a moment and then come back . 
  some of mine can be like that , though i have got more serious ones . 
  you can feel them coming and when it is over you will know you had one , but during it you may not know anything about it at all . 
  as a result it is often more difficult for the people around someone having a seizure than for the person themselves . 
  we miss out on all of the fuss and panic . 
  when you are having one , you obviously can not explain what is happening , so many people do n't know what is going on and draw all sorts of conclusions . 
  others will recognise that it is a seizure and be calmer . 
  like the tide , you can not stop someone having a seizure , so you just have to let it run its course and make sure the person does n't come to any harm during it and be there when they come round . 
  naturally people will panic and call doctors or ambulances , but in many cases it is not necessary . 
  a seizure is like a storm in the brain and it will pass . 
  for insurance reasons an ambulance might have to be called , like if someone had one on public transport , but by the time the ambulance gets there , the seizure may have finished and the person is almost back to normal . 
  for others hospitilisation may be needed . 
  in ireland the care is fairly good . 
  in my case i need very little as my seizures are not very regular or serious . 
  i am on medication since i was a child . 
  one good thing we have in ireland is the '' [ long term illness scheme ] ( http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/lti/ ) '' . 
  the main benefit for me is that my medication is paid for by the health service . 
  i have a book into which the doctor writes my prescription and i hand it into the chemist and get my medication for free and just have to sign a form . 
  the prescription can be used over and over again , with the doctor periodically having to renew it . 
  eventually the book , which is like a passport , will be filled out and i get a new one . 
  lots of long term illnesses are covered by it , though some are n't . 
  one of the most notable ones that is n't is asthma . 
  i suppose it is because no war has engulfed as much of europe or involved the big powers since world war ii . 
  the balkans war would be looked upon as involving a small part of europe , and being in a little corner of europe , `` down there '' , as it were . 
  i would n't say it is completely because it was outside the eu , but part of the eu 's success is that it has kept former enemies working together . 
  there is also an element of it being looked upon as a civil war within yugoslavia as opposed to being between the new countries that came about after the break-up of yugoslavia . 
  irish people tend to have a very dry , witty , sarcastic sense of humour , which many people from other countries do n't get . 
  we can slag each other and have no problem with it .
