well , if the population changes significantly , then it would be different . 
  but i do n't think he 's arguing anything about per capita . 
  i think the point is more that gdp is only projected to rise . 
  nah , they 're not austerity budgets . 
  austerity is n't just characterised by service cuts , it 's tax increases too . 
  what this is , is a conservative government choosing to cut taxes at the expense of services . 
  not because it 's externally imposed , not because they want to shrink the size of debt or the state , but because they 've chosen this as their priority . 
  `` it 's fact . '', 
  i 'm not so familiar with nafta , to be honest . 
  perhaps others can answer better . 
  efta is , i think , a special case , which i 'm sure we can both understand is a sort of odd byproduct of the eu . 
  a few factors come to mind which may apply to nafta , though . 
  first , the trading system is less expansive than the eu . 
  it 's just not as comprehensive , and presumably they 're willing to put up with the resulting inconsistencies . 
  second , the drive behind the eu was n't simply market-based , but there was an urge to force previously-warring political elites/states to interact . 
  the logic of eu expansion is stoppable : you just need to be willing to accept bizarre , costly , arbitrary irregularities . 
  i 'm not saying that pushing the eu back to just a trading bloc is impossible , just that i think it 'd be so imperfect ( so much so that it 'd be worse than the status quo ) and very difficult to achieve . 
  much the same logic applies here , though . 
  if member states want to increase energy efficiency ( which , to be honest , i would 've thought is a pretty non-contentious issue ) , then it 's best done at an eu level . 
  that 's because if italy passed a law on energy regulations on their coffee machines ( slightly increasing the cost , but improving the product ) , then greece could not apply a similar law , and unfairly use italy 's progressive law to undercut their coffee machine prices . 
  countries and companies should compete , but weakening standards is a bad way to do it , since it just leads to a race to the bottom . 
  i understand that view , but that can be difficult in practice , as certain areas tend to spillover from another . 
  let 's imagine we 're in a bare bones trading alliance . 
  france decides that it wants to increase environmental standards on their factories , as their rivers are becoming filthy . 
  since there are no trading barriers , poland decides to lower their standards in order to attract french industry . 
  normally , france could put in place corrective tariffs to deal with this , but they ca n't under the trade deal . 
  not wanting an environmental race to the bottom , countries in this trading pact come together and agree some common environmental standards . 
  now , out of a trading pact , this new alliance has itself an environmental policy . 
  but coming up with agreement on these trade policies is tough , so a small secretariat is set up to suggest environmental laws which the member states can then agree on . 
  sweden is also concerned that the italians are fudging their environmental statistics , and so feel cheated . 
  they then task the secretariat with monitoring member state 's compliance with the common rules on trade and the environment . 
  so now the alliance has a commission . 
  latvia decides that it wants to stop importing fruit from a nasty dictatorship on the grounds of principle . 
  since there 's a trading alliance , that would require preventing imports from other countries or some form of collective agreement among the trading partners . 
  so a fully-integrated market requires some degree of commonality . 
  the bare bones trading pact suddenly has to decide on international matters of trade , which means they have to take into account things like geopolitics , foreign affairs , human rights , labour conditions and so on . 
  before you know it , the trading alliance has itself some elements of a common foreign affairs policy . 
  this applies to a variety of other policy areas , most of which are the ones where the eu has competence or control over . 
  but hang on , this alliance is suddenly getting to control quite a bit of policy , and people feel like they 've no say in it . 
  why not remedy that with a pan-trade alliance parliament , directly elected by the people . 
  and this goes on and on . 
  european integration begets further integration . 
  it can be stopped if you want to , but it 'll mean that a lot of cheating , inconsistency and nonsense will take place . 
  that 's what i thought . 
  i 'd be wary of the reported speech in that article , and think a distinction should be drawn between defunding a project and being against the technology altogether . 
  i 've no doubt that harms herself is against iter and fusion in general , but i do n't think that 's the party policy . 
  it 's the case everywhere . 
  baseload is power which is cheap to produce and is n't quickly ramped up or down . 
  with enough other forms of power , baseload generation is n't necessary . 
  it makes things easier , but there 's no technical necessity for it . 
  no , we do n't need baseload , not at all . 
  most large power grids have it , but it 's not a technical necessity . 
  a mix of intermittent renewables and some peaking plants ( either gas or some form of storage ) could work just fine . 
  i 'm not sure the position is as clear as that . 
  i have n't seen anything to suggest they 're totally against that ( but i 'm open to correction ) . 
  the meps are against the eu putting further funds into the project above what was already planned , citing runaway costs . 
  it 's also not really worthwhile for people to suggest that a project like iter will help stop climate change , since to avoid runaway warming , we have to make most emissions cuts prior to 2050 anyway , which is when even the most optimistic iter projections say a commercially-viable plant will be ready . 
  iter is , to my mind , worth investment all the same . 
  generally you take what you 're given , and ca n't effectively choose the source . 
  ireland and austria , for example , both anti-nuclear countries , receive some amount of nuclear through their connections with their neighbours . 
  that 's not hypocrisy , just countries operating within a more connected grid . 
  i 'm an environmentalist , and active in the green political movement . 
  like many people , i 'm not pushed either way by nuclear . 
  fanboys oversell its benefits ( it 's bloody expensive , and the uk shows how it requires a higher subvention than wind , for example ) , and greens overhype the dangers . 
  but that 's not to say that a non-nuclear energy system is a total pipe dream . 
  there have been a broad variety of reports ( often from green ngos , but others too ) working out exactly how it would work . 
  even with new nuclear , the commission tends to work on the basis of high res , high savings , no matter what . 
  how would public finances being `` under control '' improve the british economy ? 
  that 's a silly headline . 
  it has a population of 1.3 million , yet produce more ** per head ** ... um , yes . 
  of course it can make its own decision . 
  nobody is questioning that . 
  but switzerland has benefitted from being , in some ways , part of the european project . 
  if they want to opt out of that , that 's their right , but it 's also the right of the eu to choose not to include them in all other parts too . 
  freedom of movement and labour in europe is an incredible achievement , and a principle worth defending . 
  that 's really cool !, 
  well done . 
  i used to work for one of the contributing organisations you mentioned , but had n't heard of this coming . 
  just a typo i spotted on the front page : it should be `` bodies '' not `` bodys '' . 
  sure . 
  it 's not a view i 'm completely convinced by , but one i see the merits of . 
  but i do n't think whether it 's a numerical limit makes much of a difference . 
  limiting people from moving around because you do n't want more `` foreign '' people in your country could reasonably be seen as necessarily racist or xenophobic . 
  ( like i said , though , it 's not a view i 've given enough thought to . ), 
  unless you regard most migration controls as being rooted in some form of xenophobia or racism ... 
  indeed . 
  there are some goods which are less elastic in terms of price and demand , but to pretend that the relationship between price and demand for swiss goods is 0 is bizarre . 
  indeed . 
  the research firm ecofys estimate that if the eu were to cut its energy use by 35 % by 2030 ( through a binding energy savings target ) , it would save a ** net ** $ 250bn ** annually ** . 
  not only do you save on imports , but it would actually lower regional prices for fossil fuels , as demand would be much lower . 
  indeed . 
  the big surprise has been the alleged attitude of the bundesbank during that period . 
  but it 's difficult to say how much of that is revisionist on their part . 
  i 'm with you on most of that , but i do n't buy the idea that corruption or even friendship explains the bank guarantee . 
  it was a blanket guarantee for all banks to try and preserve the stability of the sector . 
  the losses at anglo were n't known at the time , and the anglo tapes release by the independent confirm this . 
  i think the bank guarantee is an example of a shit policy , rather than any actual corruption . 
  you 're spot on about labour opposing membership . 
  but there 's a dangerous and far too common misconception about the prisoners ' votes issue ( along with the human rights act and so forth ) . 
  these decisions have * nothing * to do with the eu .
