polish diplomats seem to be really quite humble . 
  here 's a video their embassy in dublin did in irish . 
  quite touching  https://youtu.be/mrohfq8cjps, 
  today you , tomorrow me , cyprus < 3, 
  ** first language : ** english ** second : ** irish ( still got a decent grasp because i 'm in leaving cert ) ** learning : ** french . 
  have 95 % of the grammar nailed and working on building up my vocabulary and aural skills ( trying french music and some videos on youtube ) i know some ( really weird ) polish phrases and swear words . 
  only been to ireland ( home ) , spain ( many times ) , belgium and the uk ( scotland , been to ni but do n't really count that ) . 
  this coming summer ( 2017 ) i hope to add the netherlands and germany to that list !, 
  again ?? 
  first the danes and now this !, 
  we 'll form a great big empire with the vatican as the 33rd county !, 
  christmas is just around the corner , 
  i 've even heard them say things like '' . . with some sunny spells across ireland and northern ireland '' . 
  it 's a bit odd to hear though i can understand why they say it like they do . . 
  was he at the g8 summit in northern ireland that time ? 
  ( or maybe it was g7 ? ), 
  this map is hilarious without the context, 
  well hello there, 
  kremlinites probably,

  seriously ? 
  it may be a `` drop in the water '' for westminster but what 's to say that london is going to replace that # 500m funding with their own allocated in a similar way ? 
  agriculture may be an old industry but it is n't dying , it 's a vital part of the irish economy and is necessary , unless of course you 'd prefer to import agricultural goods from the eu with tariffs . . and yeah , nobody needed peace anyway , europe was a much better place during the the two consecutive world wars and interwar period , why ever did we go for peace and stability !, 
  irish pound stronk !, 
  i 'm honestly not too sure but i believe it 's dublin city council that regulates it the limit . 
  some modern high rise apartments and office spaces is what the city needs , not more urban sprawl . 
  it 's a mess, 
  we 've got gaa players with hurleys, 
  but . . but . . muh nhs ? 
  could be the kick in the arse we need to remove dublin 's archaic height limits or urbanise other parts of the country, 
  is that a new thing ? 
  how about celtic isles ? 
  once we get the celtic union in full swing we can take over england and wales bit by bit , they 'll not notice a thing !, 
  finally we can unite the british isles once more !, 
  savage, 
  tayto is in the constitution , it 's the only way, 
  welcome brothers . 
  we can share data , it does n't require british officials in irish ports . 
  damn right . 
  that 's what he read on facebook and in the comments section of news articles , which are obviously bastions of factual information !, 
  i think there 's a lot more who would be open to the idea of a federal europe with ireland in it . 
  times have changed and people are moving o. 
  besides , there would be a referendum on joining if it ever did come to fruition so it 's not like we 're getting colonised . 
  is that supposed to be an insult ? 
  huh , it does n't mention us alongside the other countries that ca n't avail ? 
  you can use interrail passes on irish rail here with no problems . 
  unless i 'm missing something , lol, 
  love it, 
  i know a guy ... 
  you used the same joke the other day lol, 
  and everybody knows the people in boston are more irish than the irish !, 
  weak effort , you need to try harder next time . 
  the deal is really very good , three coverage is usually fine in the cities and towns but can be patchy outside of that but for what you 're getting that 's fair imo , and i live in a city anyway . 
  i usually use about 30gb a month but have a friend out in the sticks who can get 4g and uses his tethering connection as his home `` broadband '' since it 's faster than the dsl he gets , lol . 
  are those electronic price tags common ? 
  i 've never seen them before but it seems like a smart idea if the cost of the displays is cheaper than manually changing prices or labels for restocking . 
  the only way i can see this working is with passport checks between gb and ni . 
  checks on the irish border are a no-go really . 
  beautiful, 
  the shit stirring in these comments ... 
  still waiting for us to join :(, 
  vatican city wo n't / do n't stamp passports even on request , sadly :(, 
  out of curiosity , why would they be doing this and for what benefit ? 
  fantastic news , congrats kosovo !, 
  the voting will certainly be interesting ... 
  [ take it or leave it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bwdnzdu.jpg ), 
  one day ... j' esp\u00e8re ... 
  yep . 
  i 've since removed them and replaced them with little sticky notes since it looks cleaner . 
  it really does , and it 's awesome !, 
  here 's a huge laminated map i got from the eu bookstore a few months ago , [ image ] ( https://vgy.me/ubqnp0.jpg ) !, 
  yes , we all make sure to keep it very clean and when we 're done with it we send it onto the next guy . 
  it really is very efficient !, 
  i think they 're great !, 
  i 've got some pounds in my wallet at the moment for a trip to scotland and the # 20 is just huge ... it 's sticking out the top of my wallet . 
  even the # 10 note is bigger than our $ 20 note !, 
  i got one too , it 's actually pretty large so it looks really nice !, 
  :d [ map !, 
  this is true !, 
  i got an awesome map of the eu/europe for my wall completely for free and it was delivered by courier . 
  has some gdp stats on it and all . 
  very good resource that site is . 
  edit : [ here 's the map !, 
  not to mention that fact that ireland actually commemorated the deaths of british soldiers too !, 
  yeah , this . 
  low taxes and a skilled english speaking workforce . 
  this guy ^, 
  seriously ? 
  it 's an image taken from space , where the focus is clearly on scotland . 
  the stars and satellites are n't going to align perfectly over scotland so that the photo does n't include ni or england just to please you ... scotland is absolutely a `` region '' / `` constituent country '' of the uk , but that does n't make it not a country with its own identity , language , flag and government . 
  scotland is a country , but it 's not a * sovereign * country ( same with wales , england and ni ) . 
  the title is european countries , not `` eu countries '' so therefore scotland has every right to be in the title . 
  this is a pointless argument . 
  turn malta into ibiza for a week , plenty of boats down there these days and sure we have our vast navy to take care of things back home  buy malta perhaps ? 
  i wo n't stop you , have at it , 
  the focus of the image is on scotland , there 's no need to be pedantic about it, 
  economies of scale , and who said it had to be on our fair isle !, 
  $ 25.62 per eu citizen . 
  sure if nobody 's taking it we may as well go on the lash for the night ? 
  thinking ahead , lads ,
