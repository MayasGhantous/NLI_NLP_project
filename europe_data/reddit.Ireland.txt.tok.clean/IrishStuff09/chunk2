  it would n't be a thread about scotland without comments like this ... 
  so many layers to this conspiracy , will i soon be issued with my european id as part of the united earth under the illuminati and the new world order ? 
  sounds great - i 'll collect it monday . 
  who gives a shit what colour a passport is ? 
  if anything , having the same colour for all eu passports shows border agents that you are probably an eu citizen before you even rock up to their desk . 
  perhaps a symbol of our nationality , but what good is that if the only people to ever see that are me and an immigration officer ? 
  i imagine they might be in some places , but perhaps not everywhere . 
  there was definitely some form of a speed cap on my data in scotland anyway as even in edinburgh city centre i 'd be hovering around .7 - 1mbps , same with my friend also on three . 
  1mbps is fairly dire these days so if the cap is reasonable it would n't be too bad imo, 
  this still applies to the uk until they officially leave , and three have good roaming plans anyway . 
  though i 'm glad of this , my speeds on 3 uk ( i 'm on 3 ireland ) were capped at 1mbps when i was roaming in scotland which sucked :(, 
  pretty sure there are no aldi stores in northern ireland which is interesting ( though presumably it 's just counting uk overall stats ) . 
  `` our day will come . '', 
  truly a beautiful phrase , 
  did iceland decide it was too cold up there and decide to * chill * with us ? 
  i 've always been fond of the old folk phrase during the 1798 rebellion , '' * tiocfaidh \u00e1r l\u00e1 . 
  scotland wins independence and portugal becomes a rectangle :d, 
  i gave up midway when i tried to draw the russian border . 
  http://i.imgur.com/sajin3v.png colours are loosely based on the flag of that country . 
  god damn we look so sexy all united , 
  it 's a phrase coined by p\u00e1draig pearse ( i believe ? ), 
  and the original irish is `` t\u00edr gan teanga , t\u00edr gan anam . '', 
  personally i 've never seen brazilian meat on sale here as we produce more than we consume in ireland anyway , perhaps it 's a different story elsewhere in the eu, 
  pretty sure , the meat i buy has the location of the farm on it anyway and fruits say the country . 
  i 've got exams for the next two weeks but i 'll be there after , and i 'll try to make it to one in dublin too  ( and the one in amsterdam if it 's still going in july ! ), 
  wtf how did i not know about this , i was in town today !, 
  we are the new switzerland ? 
  aallll right , up top !, 
  we love you guys really, 
  nope pretty sure every polling station is in a school , at least the vast majority anyway . 
  i live in a city and they 're held there , and my family who live on an island also have it in their local primary school ( though a day earlier ) . 
  i suppose it 's easier to organise it that way , than having setups in town halls and police stations ? 
  in our local one in galway they use almost every room in the school as a polling station !, 
  just like loyalists burning the flag of the ivory coast around the 12th of july . 
  brain dead . 
  [ you know . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/ps3kxgo_gro ), 
  no abortions down here either ( in reality ), 
  it 's not exactly like british education teaches much about their nearest neighbour and their colonial history there . 
  i had hoped i did n't need / s in a thread with fellow citizens of the atlantic archipelago , 
  my favourite atlantic archipelago, 
  i think we 've got ourselves a new trend :d, 
  ahhh i get what you mean now , that seems logical . 
  though i think by the time a single eu passport for the common man comes about , it is likely ireland will be a part of schengen by then . 
  especially if there 's going to be a hard border with ni after brexit ( regardless of the cta existing ) , we may as well join schengen if that is going to be the case . 
  i am aware of that , but it still does n't mean non-schengen eu countries should n't get an eu passport . 
  it 's not like non-eu schengen members like norway or iceland would get eu passport, 
  we are all still eu citizens regardless of schengen , so i would say everyone surely ? 
  * right * ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  [ 9 in ireland ] ( http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/leave_and_holidays/public_holidays_in_ireland.html ) , i think it 's one of the lowest in europe . 
  can kosovars claim serbian citizenship , since serbia still sees kosovo as serbian ? 
  only thing i do n't like about gbp is that the coins are n't physically sized based on their worth ( like the 1c coin is smaller than 2c , 5c bigger than 2c and so on ) the pound coin tho . . that 's got some weight to it, 
  in other news , water is wet . 
  looks as if the cliffs of moher went on a diet, 
  i speak french and have a decent level of irish too so that is not necessarily true for the whole population . . 
  back up top boys, 
  pineapple pizza is glorious and do n't let anyone say otherwise !, 
  $ 396 per year with a leap card in galway for under 19s . 
  ( i just pay per journey though , $ 0.91 per journey . 
  $ 684 for a student and $ 852 for an adult . 
  buses only ( there are no trams anyway ) . 
  fantastic news for romania , and europe . 
  you 're right , `` european federation '' or `` eussr '' is much better !, 
  to add to that , when i went to scotland in july last year , my 3g roaming on 3 uk ( im on 3 ireland ) was capped at less than 1mbps constantly . 
  really frustrating . 
  ] ( https://vgy.me/qrpvfu.png ) its mainly because i have unlimited data so there 's no point ever using my wifi unless i 'm downloading something substantial, 
  the boom is back , baby !, 
  the main reason i indicated national armies was because realistically , i do n't think most countries would be willing to 100 % give up their own armies ( especially if the eu was still a union and not a more integrated federation of sorts ) . 
  i suppose you could have an eu army like the us army ( forgetting us foreign policy ) , and each country ( state ) uses a portion oftheir national army as the equivalent of the `` national guard '' . , and the remainder become `` european '' soldiers . 
  it 's not something i 've given a whole lot of thought to really, 
  get applying for those visas then !, 
  we 'll charge them rent, 
  52 % you mean !, 
  i 'm in favour of an eu army if it 's solely defensive and stays out of other countries ( syria , afghanistan etc ) . 
  if a country wants to involve themselves there then they can send their national army . 
  if it ever came about i imagine a proportion of supporting eu country 's national armies would be chosen to do `` eu '' duty , rather than start a new recruiting process for `` new '' eu soldiers . 
  i 'm not opposed to either really, 
  same in the irish passport , but on the last page . 
  cooler than our underground metro for sure :(, 
  i do n't see how they can change much given that people from ni are entitled to irish citizenship , british citizenship , or both . 
  there 's a significant chunk of people with just irish passports living in ni ( and the uk ), 
  what 's it like living in san marino ? 
  just you wait until we unveil our nukes, 
  thanks for that , 
  blurry i know , could n't find a higher resolution copy unless someone has access to the online archives and could provide a higher quality image ( 1.1.1973 , irish independent ) headlines read ; '' * good morning , europe !, 
  * '' '' * historic moment as we go into the e.e.c. 
  * '' '' * taoiseach : my hope for a true unity * '', 
  fair enough, 
  i agree with you , though it should be noted that the reason we had a referendum was because a constitutional change was required for ssm , and a referendum is needed for every change to the constitution . 
   16th march they 'll arrive in ireland disappointed so . 
  huh , did n't know serbians needed a visa to visit ireland !, 
  answered !, 
  the only thing was the relationship question , i answered not applicable ( or no ? ), 
  but the follow up questions were still mandatory so i just chose `` do n't know '' instead . 
  `` northern ireland '' as a state has only ever existed in its current form from 1920/21 when the irish free state ( 26 counties ) was made a dominion in the commonwealth , and the remaining 6 counties remained with the uk to form ni . 
  dublin ruled the island of ireland pre-1800 ( in most aspects , i suppose it was like home rule ), 
  so the enabling act v2 ? 
  i 'm getting sick of this political shit, 
  wait till you see the border of baarle-hertog ( be ) and baarle-nassau ( nl ) [ link ] ( https://youtu.be/oe93j33sfhy ), 
  reminds me of [ this old christmas tree ] ( http://www.dublintown.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/christmas-tree-on-oconnell-street-e1353355850117.jpg ) from a few years ago on o'connell street in dublin .
