  i pay $ 20 for unlimited 4g data with three .

  lovely little city , was there in april !, 
  meant to go up to the top of that tower in the photo but never got the chance as we were flying out from charleroi ( a week after the attacks ) so had to catch a train . 
  i think this was the comment where he mentioned ireland , then `` casually '' said * western england * or something like that . 
  his other comments were basically shit talking the irish language and other poor trolling attempts, 
  the race is on !, 
  taking one for the team . 
  boris and farage are the saviours of the eu after all !, 
  your third comment in this thread and still you 've set the bar so very low edit : and deleted . 
  what a coward, 
  close enough, 
  is it monaco ? 
  fair point . 
  you ca n't blame irish people for not liking the term british isles , after the history between our two islands . 
  i should note i 'm not a fan of using the term `` english '' in place of `` british '' , and it really does n't occur often except perhaps colloquially . 
  `` the english '' is a common saying/term in place of `` british '' when talking about things that happened in the past ( like `` the english '' coming over etc ) . 
  it 's not correct but that 's how it is,

  i do n't think that 's anywhere near as bad as brexit or trump though , since it only takes a referendum to change . 
  ( setting aside the fact that fg or ff have n't said they would have a referendum ), 
  would this be for schengen countries only ? 
  well that certainly rules out swiss,

  unfortunately not , but you 'll get a tenner for registering for their mobile app which you get to keep for out of bundle costs . 
  not a huge deal for me anyway as it 's mainly texts and data that i use, 
  20gb and unlimited data ( + calls and texts ) from 3pm friday to 11:59 pm on sunday . 
  normally i would n't have gone for vodafone because of their low data caps , but their vodafone x plan for students @ $ 20pm enticed me over, 
  got this text from vodafone ie yesterday confirming that they would be removing all roaming charges , with no fuckery like three have been doing . 
  glad i switched recently https://imgur.com/a/sd6gt, 
  * the boom ( v2 .0 ) intensifies *, 
  not whilst there is still a border with the uk via ni . 
  joining shengen would * guarantee * the need for a border there . 
  united i 'm all for it . 
  or in the unfortunate event where hard border controls are forced in the event of a colossally shit brexit deal [ long term ] . 
  add to that they 've changed the pre pay plan durations from 30 days to 28 . 
  ( vodafone , three and now meteor ), 
  very interesting coin , reminds me a lot of our first commemorative $ 2 coin last year , commemorating the 100th anniversary of the easter rising . 
  but on the other hand , we ban alcohol sales today !, 
  it 's always the people with uk flairs posting shit like this ... hmm . . 
  aye , the three i learned were `` clann '' ( most used ) , `` teaghlach '' and `` muintir '', 
  yu ming is ainm dom, 
  try the `` revolut '' app . 
  you can use a lot of currencies with it and they send you a debit card to use ( any currency ) as well . 
  they also offer a free euro bank account with an iban ( based in lithuania ) . 
  `` tank top '' i think , but i call them wife-beaters because it 's funnier lol, 
  irish & english - compulsory from beginning to end a choice of french / german ( sometimes spanish/italian/japanese , but most schools stick to the main two ) - compulsory for 3 years but from my experience the majority of people keep it up for the 5 years of secondary school and french is the most popular choice . 
  i have n't gotten copper coins in my change for months in ireland ( not even 5c strangely ) , which made it really strange when i went to germany to get a load of 1s , 2s and 5s back for the first time in quite some time . 
  i was always told it was good luck here, 
  do the police not take your drivers licence if you get suspended ? 
  seems like it would make more sense if they do n't already do that, 
  agreed , both the greek and union jack are pretty iconic flags which look pretty badass imo . 
  i do n't mind our tricolour given what it stands for , but it 's not that unique . 
  * looks at c\u00f4t\u00e9 d'ivoire *, 
  yes , for quite a few years now . 
  the levy is an odd number like 21c or 23c which i think is better as those extra few cents are enough ( for me anyway ) to make me not buy the plastic bag and bring my own etc. 
  if it was flat like 20c , i can see people using it as a way to get rid of change like 10c/20c coins . 
  across the country , probably a bus from galway to dublin for $ 19 and a train for a little bit more , maybe $ 23 ( student fare ) . 
  if you live near an airport , then pretty far if ryanair have a sale aha, 
  ah okay , thats pretty cool . 
  definitely something i 'd keep just for the sake of it , 
  do you have to keep that electoral card for the next elections ? 
  it looks like there 's space for a few more years worth of stamps !, 
  [ just keep one country  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ermj1nj.jpg ), 
  contactless debit cards are pretty widespread with most banks here , which people do use a lot from what i 've seen . 
  my aib card is non-contactless but every time i hand it to the cashier they check to see if it is enabled . 
  now though apple pay and android pay are available . 
  recently i 've been using my ulster bank card through apple pay to pay for some small things , and it has worked . 
  never get any strange looks , but i have n't seen anyone else pay this way yet . 
  usually spoken in a few areas outside the gaeltacht, 
  in general if you find a good sports bar they should be showing it , or you can ask them and they 'll put it on if they have the channel . 
  ca n't see regular bars or hotels playing them on tv though . 
  kitchen , do n't have a utility . 
  not very common , but those that do are generally people who do n't really care about school/exams/education and either drop out after the junior cert , or do a bad leaving cert .
