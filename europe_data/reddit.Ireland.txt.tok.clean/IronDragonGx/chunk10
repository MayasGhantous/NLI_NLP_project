  brussels plot confirmed ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   billboards full of stuff like `` let 's stop brussels !, 
  that triggers me when people call the eu brussels or the brussels block ( looking at you daily mail ) it 's just the eu people from the 27 states come to a agreement on a issue and act as one body the eu '' `` rant over '' surely your government knows what they are doing will backfire and they might get kicked out of the eu ? 
   they would never even dream of leaving the eu , especially since the population is pro-eu by large . 
  yet there is talks of having hungry kicked out of the eu : /  it 's more like an external enemy they can rally the populace against . 
  i thought that was what isis was for ? 
   government why does your government hate the eu so much ? 
  brext uk report live : everything is on fire !,

  you seem to know alot about visas  but i know the visa free travle so i ll stick to staying in the eu as much as possible , 
  well i might have it it wrong but we needed a visa for nz but that was a stemp at the border on our passports , but australia on the other hand needed to have the visa sorted before we landed and left ireland and show it it at the border along with the passport  as a eu citizen you do n't need a visa for most of the countries in the world cant say this has been my experience tho outside the eu that is . 
   born in the windmill i dont think it gets more dutch than that tbh, 
  tell that to me sister who needed one to visit and of course to stay there the last few years , i tell no lies i needed a visa to get into nz ( issued in aus ), 
  feb of last year . 
  mmmm well i needed a aus visa as i was staying over 8 hours waiting to hope on my plane to nz also needed a nz valid for 3 months so it would seem my experience was different . 
  with australia ? 
  i doubt it will some how :(, 
  heres hoping , 
  ow that 's good to know to , had to have a visa for both new zealand and australia the one for australia was only me passing though for like 8 hours needed a visa just for that its a real pain . 
  easier visa access to japan please always wanted to visit , 
  ya her whole ge campaign was a joke all right : /, 
   maybe comedy 's not for you . . you try and not be a miserable c$ $ $ t and this is what happens :( maybe you 're right lad maybe you 're right . 
   human rights laws stop us from doing it , we 'll change the laws so we can do it . '',

   the tsunami would have to magically cross the uk and ireland as there 's not really any active tectonic plates off our coast , we dont even worry about tsunami ,  but i have been to new zealand where tectonic plates are very active and even experienced a small earthquake let me tell ya the fear of tsunami is very real in that part of the world . 
   but we learn from them and adapt reminds me of the walls in attack on titan . 
  but then amsterdam would be gone the horror the pure horror :(, 
   5 years till our next ge mate . 
  i do n't really see this tax taken off somehow .

   the dublin parade would be vastly better if we had a bunch of guys with samurai swords staging a fight as one of the acts samurai leprechauns confirmed for 2018 ( \u0361 \u00b0 ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) \u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
   is n't pro eu sentiment really common in ireland ? 
  well yes , that said i have taken note of a rise in anti eu sentiment of late due in part to brexit sure there was like 3 4 people outside city hall in cork few weeks bk burning the eu flag but were having a hard time setting it on fire ... ... ... 
   just the local pubs seeking a reason for people to drink beer you need a reason for drinking in the netherlands ? 
  here it just kinda happens one moment your sipping on a pint the next downing a whole naggin of smirnoff ( vodka ) : /  when i was a student everything was a good reason to drink beer , even though we did n't really need a reason . 
  as i understand it you guys have alot of festivals/gatherings when i was visiting just before xmas there was something on called ade amsterdam got to see don diablo , 
   we also had st patrick 's day parties in the netherlands cant say i am surprised alot of irish living out that way  usually with music the dubliners and suchlike .

   at least our passports are a different colour !,

   now it 's time for a semblance of an idea of where to go and how i think [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bikx8loektq ) might work, 
  no government and non eu access/membership things are shaping up well over in the uk then ? 
   st patrick 's day a europe-wide holiday .
