  the eu needed to move fast to replace the uk we have better friends -_-, 
  as long as it comes with some of them world class djs such as don diablo then happy days !, 
  well there 's a piece of ireland missing there lad, 
   invaders or planters i know just wanted to be nice about it ^_^ the fact most if not all our citys/towns where founded by the vikings says a lot really : /, 
  i am in two minds here i went to move to the netherlands as i enjoy the dutch way of life its horrifying to think it might not be around to much longer :( but i will say this ireland has a long history people coming to live here and it has contributed to our way of life over the years . 
  take a look at new zealand the natives became a minority there and it did not end well for them :(, 
   if it 's important , it 's worth complaining about . 
  please teach us your strange ways :3 in ireland complaining is a well known pass time, 
  [ are you sure about that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohc1230opog ) ? 
   still europeans [ are you sure about that ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohc1230opog ) ? 
  i ll amet i have fallen out with a few uk friends over brexit it sucks i meen the eu brought ireland an england together hell the queen even took a visit to cork a few years back you have no idea how big of a deal that was !, 
  but now i fear all the good will and good work that has been done thanks in part to the eu will be undone really sucks :(, 
   something i saw first-hand , and it 's gross . 
  care the share i would be interested in hearing this tail . 
  meh i v been there last year they have alot of boats in amsterdam i m sure they will be fine wet !, 
  but fine they will be :3, 
  tbh he did look very sad when he got the letter :(, 
  maybe i did ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  pain when taking a shit best if you have a chat with a doctor about that . 
  i guess we will have to wait and see on that one, 
  its a downright shame that no one before the vote ever talked about how this would affect ireland as a whole north and south both sides of the argument . 
  they saw the eu as a big bad evil of the world and only voted based on lies whatever happens next know that we in cork well welcome the north of ireland into the republic but that is something you lot need to decide for yourselves . 
   it 's not quite over yet yes !, 
  this is only the beginning, 
  true financially and politically your bit rough around the edges but you always be welcomed in the republic  its up to you lot to pick up the phone and come on over . 
  be a real shame if the doctor who saves him form said heart attack is a coloured people , 
  nigel farage is a cross dresser ? 
  ya know it all starts to make sense now !, 
  i d love to be a fly on the wall the day she steps in into the room to meet with the eu lads akword ta fuck i d say ha ha, 
  trump seems to like may tho so maybe not sure has he not been invited to call over to the uk soon ? 
  well you a mixed pot then : o i guess it depends what you fled of work is i work in it there 's no shortage of jobs in dublin for it , it would also be your best bet for work but keep in mind it costs a bomb to live there might take a look at coming to cork its discount dublin in size and scope sure but its alot cheaper best of luck with whatever you end up doing , 
   eu does place considerable trade restrictions on its members . 
  even tho you are right thats not as bad as you make it out to be , the reason the eu does this is to protect the single market if one member gets a say a better deal with china for steel than another state does then you 're single one market falls apart and the best part is the fact is was the uk who pushed for the single market to begin with funny how things work out . 
  formality yup, 
  it did and always did stop listening to the fake news, 
  ya i was thinking of moving to spain cheap cost of living and awesome food plus the sun like 85 % of the time !, 
  i work in it so you can work anywhere and do the same job  but if you still unsure about the uk then why not come to ireland you can improve your english and make more or less the same money plus i can have someone to teach me spanish :d, 
   unionists they can kiss my hairy hole reunification is whats best for everyone thats all there is to it really . 
  what will take longer : brexit negotiations or may answering a direct question at pmq 's ? 
   strong links to the us . 
  stronger than ireland ? 
  sure didt we go over and populate the the place ? 
  the funny thing is that almost looks just like her i say the `` negotiation '' will look a little something like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-pllpbmarm ), 
  [ and here we go !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsllzh9yelk ), 
  but will it be a shitstrom tho ? 
  i 'd say overall yes, 
  so germany needs to start having more kids ? 
  i would be happy to help out here if needed you can pass my number onto the ladies ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  `` rubs eyes '' true survivor is that [ you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztidn2dbyby ) ? 
   lights the fire under some asses . 
  in two years the eu states will meet with the uk and sing [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40od45djca4 ), 
  did n't even do anything for paddy 's day this year saw lots of american around the place tho, 
  what can we say we are a horny bunch of lads when we go aboard ha ha ha, 
  cuz she ca n't read english ? 
  i m sure the u.s wo n't let that happen we are way to irish for them to ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  how the eu will look when they see mays [ letter ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/unf2t6vmpzs/maxresdefault.jpg ), 
   triggered how the eu will look when they see the [ letter ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/unf2t6vmpzs/maxresdefault.jpg ), 
  quick question will the irish be let stay or is the common travel area still in effect between england and ireland ? 
   fuck this bitch i ll pass on that one thanks she does n't really do it for me :(, 
  it worked out well for us almost a 100 years ago best of luck with that tho :d, 
  well no the uk has for some time grown to dislike the eu so its best if we in some way part on good terms, 
  even if i do n't have a tv i still under law have to pay this and that sucks :(, 
  for now but keep in mind our government loves to add new taxes all the dam time :(, 
  so your saying we should learn to fly as well ? 
   what radicalized him question is what radicalized nigel farage ? 
  aw it 's the swedish and spanish ladies for me lad . 
  yes just before xmas !, 
  but never tried any weed as i dont smoke :\\ should be back over in the summer time for the tomorrowland train ride so maybe then . 
  ok if there is a kill switch why would the u.s use it in a matter that has for the most part nothing to do with them keep in mind for every shot fired the u.s makes money the spanish after all need to buy more ammo to re stock . 
  and in ireland we use the [ potato launcher ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykf3tuti2hu ) system . 
  he just wants to be a meme so bad :3, 
  lol the way the netherlands sees the eu made my day ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  nice for some :( i d go there if i where you just saying :3, 
  thanks for the wall of text :(, 
   tax regimes na the eu knows full well this is a step to far, 
   i made myself hungry you 're not the only one , the above does sound nice might have to try indian food again so , 
  its a sorry state of affairs lads the greeks gave the world so much its a real shame to hear stories like this . 
  we left the empire in 1922 so ireland should be gray , 
  i dont know for the craic maybe ? 
  aw you might be a bit stuck then , i know if your grandfather was born here and you can prove it you can get an irish passport outside of that my knowledge on this is not the best . 
  best bet would be to wight to the irish embassy and ask there they would be able to tell you more then i can they might even just give you a passport for the craic you never know . 
  :d also new zealand is a fine place my sister lives out and i v been last year . 
  having the uk passport would make getting a visa way easier for you in nz and australia so you can always use that as a fall back . 
  brexit sucks for everyone but best of luck what whatever happens :d, 
  there was plans for the uk to invade ireland in these days :(, 
  no one is happy about it not even the brits, 
  well to be fair you cant go wrong with a curry cheese chips yummy !, 
  but i ate at a indian place one time and well it was not the best sadly :(, 
   infrastructure issues it has a bright future for it you have no idea if we had a good standard of infrastructure say along the lines of the uk infrastructure we would do very well in need taking all the it , banking and whatever else jobs from the uk . 
  but sadly we dont and its super hard right to get around and to find a place to rent/live so much so in fact i am thinking about moving to the netherlands i enjoy their way of life , 
  the same could be said of the uk ( \u3065 \uff61 \u25d5 \u203f \u203f \u25d5 \uff61 ) \u3065, 
  @xaethon i take it your engish ? 
  if so do you not have any irish blood in you if you do you might be able to pick up an irish passport if not well you could still come to live and work in ireland due to the common travel area the uk and ireland have outside of eu agreements its not much but its something if negotiations go tits up ( \u3065 \uff61 \u25d5 \u203f \u203f \u25d5 \uff61 ) \u3065, 
   i 'm irish and i think we should consider following britain the hell man we spent to much time trying our hardest to move away from the uk as someone we works in it let me tell if we get grand ideas like this we are done for there would be no reason to come and do business here none !, 
  the eu has been good to ireland and if we can wing it we might do lot better due to the uk leaving the block, 
  dont we all , 
  sorry but its just not good food :(, 
  dont forgot march for marching , 
  shitshow indeed but you do know we have 2 full years of he said she side the eu wont gives everything we went dont they know we are british !,
