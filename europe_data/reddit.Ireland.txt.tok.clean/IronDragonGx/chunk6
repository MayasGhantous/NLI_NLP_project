  i said to myself wow this is what we ( ireland ) should be working towards this is the standard we should aim for as a nation state i am looking forward to my return to the netherlands in the summer time so please i ask as both an eu citizen and an irish man for the love of all that is good in the world do n't vote for this nazi amad\u00e1n keep the netherlands an open and grate nation and a shining example of what a eu state and indeed the eu itself should be . 
  `` i hope they make that mistake . 
  the tougher the brexit will be , the closer the eu 's member will have to stand together , the faster and the easier the needed reform will be done . '', 
  i agree but you guys may soon have le pen in office who is talking about taking france out of the eu so the uk may well get away with it :(, 
  its good for you i guess :3, 
  ya even us irish dont get drunk on st. patricks day just saying :3, 
  alot i think : o, 
  omg this is news to me :3 i had no idea, 
  ya i am kinda glad this is happening the irish government wanted us to pay hand over fist for water that would seem is not even fit for purpose and then sell water off to highest bidder good old irish government never working for whats best for the irish people (-_-), 
  then surly i would be fijian no ? 
  i know a guy around my age who was born here in ireland but moved and lived in england form the age of 8 his now more english then irish even voted for brexit as i understand but yes i guess some people who voted for this thought they would just keep there eu citizenship ? 
  some in the uk seem to just plan hate the eu cant say i know why that might be :(, 
  well i guess you are of irish decent then its just after the brexit vote there was a lot of people applying for irish passports not because they wanted to be irish or anything like that but to just keep there eu rights in case the uk goes tits up cant say i blame them but it was very distasteful to see irish passports/citizenship just be horsed out like that is all :(, 
  take a walk lad !, 
  no one i should think alot of remoaners ar trying hard to make that happen, 
  ya we should maybe think about looking into that rule i cant say i like the idea of handing out passports to every joe soap out there who may or may not be irish : / as a side point thinks to you guys we might be out of the eu soon as well there are these here who think it would be a fantastic idea ow the joys of populism :(, 
  come on dude amet there will be poorer areas outside of london that where getting money form the eu but wont be after all this has ended uk people voted to be worse off theirs no two ways about it like . 
  indeed this is the big fear here if say being gay was illegal at some point in the future then the use of the this data could be used against you and as someone who works in it data never is 100 % removed form the net its on there its there forever :(, 
  aw netherlands come on your meant to be the cool guys of the eu with your public transport and stuff this is not cool at all :(, 
  thats awesome may end up making the move myself soon :d, 
  good for the economy alright i noticed that big time when i visited late last year everything cost so much :( its why i m still thinking about a move there to cost of living is very high i ll be back around that way in the summer so who knows that might be the make it or brake it moment for me . 
  i know its the same price i v looked ha thing is tho amsterdam is a way better city and has a working public transport system ( unlike ireland ) and is well connected to the rest of the eu , 
  indeed , it sucks to see this tho i meen it was there government that fucked up here and now the people have to pay for it not to different to what happened here with the banks in 2008 i need we need to come together as the eu and do whats best for greece : /, 
  think greece should just hack and use some cheat codes like ha . 
  it would be a good thing for the people if they stay in the eu but they would need to be out of the euro currency and yes debt relief would help but this very unlike the imf to suggest funny one has to wonder . 
  not a bad idea only thing is they would still need to pay back the money same issue different money . 
  as sick as ever time to put them down so i guess : o all bad jokes aside i think greece needs to sort its self out big time even if that meens exiting the eu then so be it if thats whats best for greece we cant keep baling them out . 
  yaaaa !, 
  maybe we should start our own amazon like online shop that buys and sells in euros that will show amazon , 
  thanks grammar nazi bot for that always very enlightening advice . 
  aw well i think we can mange with out designer watches for a while  ya i hear everything costs a bomb in finland guess i ll find out in a few weeks . 
  i know sure the rent issue is nuts in dublin 's `` silicon docks '' i get offers to move to dublin to work for it company xyz but i always say no for that very reason but all the good it work in cork is drying up so might think about a move to amsterdam soon same you guys are brexiting i would of moved to cambridge alot of it pros in that part of the woods , 
  aw i hope not i buy alot of things off amazon :(, 
  detecting a bit of salt towards ze germans here ? 
  tbh its around the same price when we convert pounds to euro :3 but yes rent right now in ireland is a joke its stopping me form moving out of home and i m working full time in it (  _ < ) they would be way better off going to amsterdam even thinking about going that way myself . 
  this is what we think of this issue : https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gt9xuxqjxmm/maxresdefault.jpg , 
  right now a stranded room just a bed maybe a kitchen 1200 euros in the city of cork where i live it would be the same in dublin that said i d say london would cost more some how ? 
  dublin ftw  all jokes aside there would be better off going to amsterdam rent is way to high in dublin/ireland right now :(, 
  with talk like that we might have a case for a eirexit vote if this is how the your guys see ireland there might not be any place in the eu for us :(, 
   unionists westminster was the very reason we left the uk had they been a bit nicer to us we might very well still be part of the uk but right now i think the north needs to remain in the eu form a economy point of view the only real way to do this is to join the republic i can understand if that might be a hard sell to the unionists but together we can make ireland great again !, 
  he he  question is when this will happen not if the unionists will soon see that if the uk takes a hit over brexit it will be the likes of ni that take the worst of it when that happens the call for a united ireland will be strongest mark my words and when that time comes we can all sit down and have a chat about how we do it until then its going to be a messy one thats for sure . 
  come to cork and take a look at blackpool you wont be saying we are n't making as many babies as we used to :d : /, 
  as someone who has been to magaluf this really cracked me up :d, 
  aw man that sucks my mother also told me tails of the the troubles my father who grew up in drogheda tells me me of the hard times that where had by all and the bomb scares . 
  it is very clear that westminster does n't give a fuck about ni to anyone who cares to look well the only thing i can say about this if the people of ni desire it there will be a place here for you lot in the republic and the eu so theirs always that no need to live under the boot of westminster i would welcome a united ireland and so would other people of cork !, 
  we do !, 
  in fact alot of people form the uk applied for a irish passport to maintain there eu rights port brexit ha fun times . 
   dirty north indeed on a side note what are the feels up there over the brexit vote/border issue ? 
  theres always canada !, 
  thats what we are hoping for :d, 
  no we stand to lose alot our place in the eu is even at risk now :(, 
  i guess i mean it might grew on me :3, 
  ya all be putin her back in the box for fedex to ship ha ha all jokes aside she is not a very nice women she does stand to do well when it comes to votes tho : o, 
  that was what i said when i saw this i am a bit worried tbh i dont need no 3rd arm thanks, 
  france is well liked in these parts anyways just keep le pen in her box and all will be grand !, 
  same seems its not well known outside of dublin that is : /, 
  aw no wonder who hired them then that happens with every public works project in ireland  _ <, 
  this is why nuclear is a bad idea when it goes wrong it goes wrong in a big way i hope the uk takes note cuz that there new nuclear power plant is facing ireland :(, 
  longest pizza in the world ya say ? 
  the neanderthals in sppppaccceeeee !, 
  the duth are kinda out of this world tho so it makes sense i guess, 
  they will become the crab people of the world !, 
  good idea i d love if i got a ticket like this when i was 18 :d, 
  agreed its sad there was a time we irish where seen in a similar light, 
  that would be an ecumenical matter !, 
  william of orange tho i dont know like plus i dont speck dutch other then that looks alright : /, 
  i d say not the biggest thing when it comes to referendums the brits like to gloat about to us is we had a second referendum on lisbon a few years back ie keep voting until you get the right answer (-_-), 
  you get bears in sweden ? 
  oh god swedish bears look horrifying : o https://gloryofsweden.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/monster-bear.jpg?w=510, 
  ahh , you think rain is your ally ? 
  you merely adopted the rain . 
  i was born in it . 
  molded by it . 
  i did n't see sun light until i was already a man . 
  ireland is well know for its rain why we like to go to spain alot :d and burn like rashers of bacon in a frying pan in the sun :3, 
   angry mexican comments this has made my day !, 
  i guess you need to build a firewall to stop them coming into the comments : o sorry i ll see myself out, 
   british fleet was taken out good job michiel de ruyter !, 
  ow ha ha i have explained what happened with lisbon a number of times on this subreddt i wont be doing this time . 
  see that just sounds like `` the kitkat be killing it on the trap '' in english any was : / :3 dutch reminds me of old english . 
  part form tongue twisters the netherlands gave us some quality djs so ya good work :d geert wilders is ridding the wave of hate toward refugees thats a fact even if they are n't lazy people looking to freeload . 
  dangerous indeed : / but to be fair dutch is hard to pick up i had a go at it when i was over in the netherlands last year some words are easy but then you have some thug twisters that throw me off the game : / :3, 
  ow disproportionate crime wow i had no idea its a same i would like to live in rotterdam myself but feel like it might not be the most welcoming place . 
  ya the greek lads have had a hard ol time of it thats for sure , . 
  it would be nice if we were all all the same page when it comes to the eu !, 
  aw my mistake i meant the uk pm ha :d ya who knows both sides dont want to go back to old ways pre eu it was a very messy time alot of lives lost in my view i would like the north to rejoin the republic so ireland can be whole again but it seems unlikely its going to be one to watch over the uks exit talks thats for sure . 
  ow thats very interesting indeed so why is geert wilders so open and anti muslim ? 
  true we see that all around the world between him and the le pen one things ant looking good for the eu tho, 
  when i was last in rotterdam i saw a fuck ton of muslims around the place for a small country you have alot of people living there the muslims seems to be geert wilders biggest weapon, 
  wow all most sounds like the grands for an eu constitution of sorts the brits wont like this idea (-_-), 
  he will say anything to get into power scary part is people are listening to him i m worried for you guys and the eu ... ... :(, 
  true but it would be best to keep a eye on pen all the same remember what happened with the trump fella !, 
  ya i know i feel the same way about it i m off to finland in a few weeks and they use the euro i was happy to hear dont have to exchange anything :d, 
  been to the uk last year and its safe to say your transportation is way better then ours but that would not be hard :3 the irish do allot of complaining to ya know . 
  pizza what more could you possibly want ? 
  no sadly not fair form it all tho your pm and our pm `` met '' to have a chat about the issue in dublin but it really wont be clear whats going to happen until the talks between the uk and eu finish up but right now both the the republic and the north are gaming for a light border but then theirs calls for the ni to rejoin us i d say it wont happen but hay who knows what way it will go :d, 
  well we redid the referendum as the no side out right lied about would happen to ireland if we said yes thats history but the farage thinks its best if we lave the eu ourselfs and be left at the mercy of the uk no thanks we will pass on that one like i said i have no time for the man, 
  ya i guess that makes everything alright :d, 
  was n't theresa may responsible for immigration in a past role ? 
  ya it was only a few points could of gone ether way tbh,
