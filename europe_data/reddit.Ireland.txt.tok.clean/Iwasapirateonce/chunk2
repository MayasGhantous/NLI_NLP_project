  not executing prisoners is part of what makes us better than them . 
  better to have had him languish in prison . 
  still , better dead than running free committing more jihad . 
  fear is a powerful weapon . 
  what happened to the us post 9/11 looks like it will be coming to europe . 
  i wonder if they were caught , or if they were forced to call it off due to the security presence ? 
  they sure as hell got close though . 
  i do n't think they used it in this case to be an excuse , more as a partial explanation for what is happening . 
   edit : so either european security agencies are crap . 
  or he 's not european . 
  which on it 's not that i think the eu security agencies are crap , it 's more that this system they have implemented bypasses the normal security channels . 
  then again , since when did speculating and proposing questions become synonymous with having a personal agenda ? 
  these are exactly the things that need to be done in light of these attacks . 
  so they possibly got trained in syria and then returned through the refugee/migrant channels to avoid detection ? 
  seems logical on their part , easier to stay under the radar and will also increase tensions in europe due to the refugee/migrant policy, 
  the closer you look at the demographics the more concerning the data is . 
  most of the uk fighters are from middle-class families - many are university graduates . 
  almost all are second/third generation immigrants ( who are generally more religious/radical than their parents ) . 
  in a lot of cases entire families have become radicalized and moved to syria . 
  luckily the uk 's current refugee/migrant policy is amongst the most sensible in europe atm , but there are definitely serious social problems that need to be addressed . 
  not without a plan for moving forward after the intervention . 
  it 's not the ideal solution , but a joint us/russian plan for peace is needed for the region . 
  the mass killing and displacement of civilians has to stop - maybe syria is just not ready for democracy , it did n't do egypt/libya a lot of good that 's for sure . 
  until then i do n't see any point for greater involvement , it will just squeeze isis towards the north african nations . 
  here is more hard data about the disturbing prevalence of radical islam around the world : [ islamic extremism research by pewglobal ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/01/concerns-about-islamic-extremism-on-the-rise-in-middle-east/ ) it 's so frustrating that so few are prepared to acknowledge the danger posed by a rapidly radicalizing islam in many parts of the world . 
  * some extracts from above source : * ** opinions on al qaueda ** * nigeria 18 % favorable * egypt 15 % favorable * turkey 5 % favorable ** often or sometimes justification for suicide bombing vs civilians when islam is under threat ** * egypt 24 % * jordan 15 % * turkey 18 % * israel 16 % serious problems exist in the world and people need to be allowed to talk about them - along with the supporting data, 
  these tournaments seem to be great to bring people together in friendship . 
  i think it is great that nations like mexico and new zealand are even starting to compete in these . 
  hopefully an irish & scottish team can get set up in the near future and join the foray . 
   as a sidenote - many ukrainian fighters took part in orange revolution , and 1 was killed by a sniper . 
  wow , i actually had no idea , that is tragic . 
  i was watching a documentary the other day on the revolution and was wondering if any of these guys were involved in the battles , as i could imagine these fighters always courageously being in the front line right were the danger was . 
  anyone know if it was special forces that originally tried to arrest the members or standard armed police . 
  did they have the required body armor and equipment ? 
  i would imagine/hope they sent in the highest threat level team to perform the arrest considering the groups history of extreme violence . 
  with ukraine usually taking the other . 
  those guys sure know how to fight in armour , much more aggressive than any of the western teams . 
  interesting ruling on the surface .

  these numbers seem to be around what most research studies suggest . 
  depressing , but not unexpected . 
  one thing i doubt this captures is the density spread of extreme beliefs . 
  10 % spread across an entire population is not impossibly dangerous . 
  but 25 % spread across an urban district is going to cause serious problems in the future , and i am certain their are areas in europe with numbers approaching 25 % or more . 
  terrorism requires neighbors/friends/family turning a blind eye to sprout . 
  something felt amiss as soon as they announced the results of these eu stress tests and the disparity from the us results became clear . 
  this regulation lacks teeth and does not primarily serve the long term public interest but rather the short term financial industry 's interests and that of individual member state political establisments . 
  i think there is undoubtedly a lot of truth in your comment but i do feel you are conflating different nationalist movements under one banner . 
  england is far larger and more diverse than scotland so it is not suprising it has more political sub-movements that pull in different directions . 
  i think it is pretty clear their are a few different strains on british ` english ' nationalism , ** center right ( with elements of far left ) civil nationalism ** desire for sovereignty and sticker border control , with a strong focus on ` cultural values ' . 
  not necessarily anti-immigration or pro ethnic nationalism , as this movement has a strong cultural connection with the commonwealth - significant support among 1st/2nd gen immigrants from india/nepal and the commonwealth . 
  often anti-globalist . 
  ** far right / alt-right ( fascist elements ) ** this is the unsavory side , that at times encompasses ukip . 
  more about ethnic nationalism and has a varying current of xenophobia that often breaks out into full on racism . 
  bnp/britain first with a significant chuck of ukip . 
  ** unionism ** ni/ulster unionism is a complicated beast , as again it can easily be broken down into subsections . 
  orangeism is pretty badly outdaded and has many arcane and unethical rules but i do n't think the movement as a whole is far-right . 
  it will be difficult for rebel tory mps to go against the whip and the wishes of a significant % of the population ( who clearly wanted immigration control ) . 
  it is a dangerous position for tory mps because going ` against ' the referendum could do a huge amount of damage to the party , undeniably putting it in a bad position for 2020 . 
  the one saving grace however is that labour and ukip are so broken atm that they could probably still win in 2020 even with blocking a hard brexit . 
  i am skeptical however , we have seen these cross party alliances before , but joining such an informal coalition is very different from voting against the party line en-mass . 
  i do n't think such an approach is impossible , but it would need to result in a full scale no-confidence vote and re-election . 
  the problem is the tories already picked their current pm who made it clear from the beginning that there would be no freedom of movement . 
  how can these mps now change their stance so late in the game and come out clean ? 
  i agree with you that posturing has it 's purpose . 
  inflicting short term damage to the uk may be able to redirect uk investment and some financial/tech firms , and produce a more favorable deal for the eu while dissuading further euro skepticism . 
  i do think their is a line however , europe is and will continue to be a connected ecosystem , and brexit or no we are likely stronger working together for the collective benefit . 
  i think some of the more hard-line rhetoric from the federalists could cause collateral damage in the long term . 
  sadly the opposition in the uk is likely too weak and divided to achieve any of this . 
  if labour where competent and the lib dems/greens etc had more credibility this might have been possible . 
  not enough conservatives would go against the whip on this . 
  the electorate and unrepresentative voting system gave the conservatives an overall majority so they call the shots, 
  we know now that as of a few days ago unlimited free access to the eu market is probably unlikely tho as the conservatives are pursuing a ` hard ' brexit . 
  the best the uk can likely hope for is a free-trade deal with low barriers to entry and trade , which overall would benefit the greater eu economic interests rather than more aggressive restrictions or falling back to wto rules . 
  if things get nasty , the uk will absolutely stand to lose the most , but everyone will get hit . 
  the eu needs to balance maintaining the integrity and unity of the eu with their individual economic interests . 
  i doubt in private many in the uk gov think they will get unlimited free access to the eu market with no freedom of movement . 
  hard brexit will likely live up to the name , but the pain can be managed by all parties depending on the policy paths . 
  their is a time for posturing and their will be a time for legitimate negotiations . 
  we are very much still in the first phase . 
  insult to the survivors of nazism and dictatorships to throw round statements like this . 
  yeah i think tory policies mostly suck , but throwing around ` racist/fascist ' every time they announce a blundering policy devalues the power and importance of the words . 
   please allow me to correct your misconception ` special deals ' was never my conception . 
  many german politicians in the eu are pragmatists and do not want a damaging high tariff / trade barrier relationship with the uk . 
  we would not have much culinary choice today if people did not experiment with different variations to recipes . 
  down with culinary-conservatism !, 
  also important to remember the eu politicians are not a unified block on the inside . 
  there has always been a struggle between eu interests and national self/economic interests behind the scenes , and some countries ( germany ) will not want an unnecessarily messy divorce . 
  hardlines and punishment seems the rhetoric of choice atm , but things may well change once negotiations get underway . 
  so where the eu bank stress tests overly lenient compared to the american ones ? 
  the us failed db but eu passed it . 
  true , the first mongol invasion of 1241 caused a frenzy of castle building in eastern europe . 
  the mongols actually suffered their first major defeat in europe in 1242 to a croatian fortress , so i guess the eastern kingdoms learned quickly . 
  they put them to good use against the mongol invasions , that 's for sure . 
  dreadful ruling . 
  not far off as bad as the net-neutrality progress was good . 
  feels like one hand giveth the other taketh away , the usual summary of the eus approach towards tech .
