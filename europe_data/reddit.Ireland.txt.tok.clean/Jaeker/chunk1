sad to see that a party of murders and child abusers is so popular . 
  there 's [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-21345997 ) opinion poll from february last year which showed 65 % wanting to stay within the uk . 
  i think there 's a more recent one which shows the figure as 70 % + but i ca n't seem to find it . 
  it would piss off russia so i would be all for it . 
  northern ireland : favourite : scotland . 
  least favourite : england . 
  it 's more france and england rather than the uk as a whole . 
  i think france has been fucked over by germany so much they have stockholm syndrome . 
  which they helped cause . 
  disarrano , rum , southern comfort , hot port or some local beer that i 've forgotten the name of . 
  the cctv cameras are generally so shite that they may as well not be there anyway . 
  sinn fein pretending to be morale is fucking hilarious . 
  the official name is gb and ni but it 's marketed as team gb .

  uk four men had a dream by jamie bryson an inspriational book from a modern day shakespeare . 
  jamie is often compared to jesus , nelson mandella and mother teresa for his good works and love for all the people . 
  calling the uk , britain is like calling the netherlands , holland . 
  no the marriage wo n't be recognised in northern ireland unfortunately . 
   if someone enters your home , immediately offer to make them a cup of tea . 
  this applies to friends , family , electricians , plumbers , landlords and even policemen .

  dafuq does `` militant atheists '' even mean , are there any atheist paramilitary groups ? 
  is richard dawkins the atheist equilavent of osama bin lid ? 
  yeah , there 's a lot of property programmes on tv in the uk and croatia was popular for a while . 
  there was a thing in the uk about croatian property a few years ago .

  he was called in not summoned . 
  edit : they were talking about this on the radio today . 
  apparentely he was invited to attend a meeting rather than summoned , which is less serious . 
  i 'll see if i can find a source . 
  edit 2 : `` the foreign ministry 's request for an explanation is a less serious diplomatic move than formally summoning the ambassador . '',

  the building of the reef is to help repair the damage done by spanish trawlers . 
  they 're loyalists and lack of education is the root of many problems in loyalist estates . 
  the issue of food security is the biggest problem not the fact that it was horse meat . 
  at this stage no one can guarantee that the meat was fit for human consumption, 
  fortunately he has no say in the matter even in the unlikely event he becomes pm . 
  i do n't see the point in learning french , if the french will pretend not to understand you anyway . 
  it 's alright if heroin and being stabbed is your sort of thing, 
  churchill tried it twice and it did n't work i would n't worry too much . 
  edit : word, 
   british propensity to ask the tough questions surely this is a good thing . 
  best ireland is too awesome to be part of mexican ireland . 
  there 's also kneecapping by appointment by the republicans . 
  i wonder if they have a secretary like if you were at the doctors . 
  this guy is painting a misleading picture . 
  there are riots everywhere in ni ; roman catholics are having their thatched cottages burnt down by loyalists drinking buckfast . 
  and hippos are raping everyone . 
   hell , many british people forget it exists at all . 
  most *, 
  northern ireland is basically in anarchy everywhere , you ca n't go outside for fear of being raped by a hippo . 
  what 's france 's game here ? 
  are they particularly exposed to greek markets ? 
  i ca n't imagine they are assisting greece out of the goodness of their hearts . 
  or calling the uk britain and leaving out ni . 
  she does n't need to , the french will do it . 
  the brazil delegate did a runner because he was afraid of being arrested . 
  i 'd guess he 'd vote for blatman, 
  everyone is spying on eveyone else and everything it 's just how it is . 
  the french do n't need opt-outs , they got what they wanted with cap .

  dublin will need more leverage other than doing the right thing if it wants the paintings . 
  sad that some republicans ca n't leave violence in the past . 
  germany needs an army but does n't want to pay for it . 
  * edit fixed a typo, 
  british is the nationality of the uk , ni is part of the uk . 
  i seem to only have odd socks , i wonder what angela merkel has to say for herself . 
  i went to poland around 11 years ago , there was a lot of women with mullets . 
  ** werner heubeck ** disclaimer : not strictly from the uk ( though he became a british ciztizen ) and i do n't know if he qualifies as unsung as he had a cbe . 
  but i do n't think he 's that well known outside of northern ireland . 
  he ran ulsterbus during the height of the troubles : `` heubeck 's tenure at ulsterbus coincided with the height of the troubles in northern ireland during the 1970s and 1980s , with public transport being a prime target of the provisional ira 's bombing campaign . 
  heubeck was well-known at the time for personally boarding buses and removing hoax bombs himself to keep the buses running to schedule . '', 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/werner_heubeck#ulsterbus_and_citybus ) . 
  `` the vast majority of the terrorist devices he moved were indeed hoaxes , but he was not to know that at the time . 
  he must have been well aware of the risks , for there were many tragic cases of people dying while trying to remove bombs planted on their premises . 
  it is astonishing that heubeck survived unscathed . 
  he would never talk about his derring-do . 
  `` my job is just to run the buses , '' he would say modestly . '',

  this is the story of the bus drivers , led by the extraordinary german werner heubeck , who struggled to maintain a sense of normality in the face of constant threats and hijacks . 
  it 's not currently available on the iplayer unfortunately but here 's a [ clip ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p025x3cy ), 
  what am i going to do with all these sandwiches . 
  that 's not something to be proud off . 
  people on the `` mainland '' do n't really consider ni part of the country . 
  edit : forgot a word , i 've being doing that a lot recently, 
  mi5 want laws past to give them retrospective permission for the shit they 've been doing . 
  most of these were in ni which doesnt really count . 
  hilarious , hope he becomes president . 
  credit goes up blame goes down . 
  i was taught in primary school that flour made explosions bigger * . 
  they blew up a couple of pianos , seemed like bit of a waste . 
  * edit : left word out . 
  i even proof read it twice . 
  walkers are shit anyway . 
  since when is ginger a swear word . 
  i 've only ever heard this from nationalists . 
  the idea if scotland leaves the union , unionists will fall apart , is nonesense as most unionsts do n't give as much of a fuck about scotalnd as nationalists think they do . 
  edit clariftication, 
  england runs everything already . 
  the independent is the left wing version of the daily mail .
