  if you want ukraine to be a russian territory ( which as a serb i suppose you do ) then you are giving the right advice . 
  but its not a proxy war , and its not inciting anything . 
  ukraine is at war with russia , it 's not light skirmishes it 's a full scale war ukraine vs. russia , a war that was started , by russia . 
  our brothers in ukraine are being killed by these fuckers and everyones solution is for ukraine to back down ? 
  i mean is this entire fucking sub insane ? 
  you may not be familiar with recent irish history , but i am very familiar with it , so fuck off . 
  better to be a war monger than to sit around with your thumb up your ass talking about how ukraine should n't fight back . 
  unlike the children in this sub who want to sit around drinking , and letting in syrian migrants in a circle of peace , ukraine still has men left who want to stand up for their nation when it 's being humiliated by foreign aggression . 
  thats even more retarded and if you had a grandpa that fought the nazis you more than anyone should know that war is necessary especially when your being fucked by a super power and no one gives two shits , and then even have the cheek to say you should n't escalate , fuuuck that . 
  `` lets not fight the third reich it will only make things worse , oh no lets not escalate '' - you 1938, 
  the current russian govt . 
  are slimy fucks even tho i admire putin from a leader pov ( i like how he puts russia first , but fuck him for what hes doing to ukraine at the same time ) what do you expect ? 
  for the ukrainians to put their tails between their legs and let russia have their land ? 
  the land ukrainians ancestors are burried in ? 
  the land that feeds them ? 
  so much cowardice on this fucking sub , has everyone removed their testicles ? 
  ukraine should 100 % escalate the war thats on their territory . 
  it was n't too long ago you serbs were putting your invaders into mass graves , the russian insurgents deserve no less . 
  no actually , they are excellent parents , a little too soft , but very good . 
  my father is an uneducated manual laborer and my mother a house wife , so you can appreciate why i dislike mass immigration , i myself am college educated ( not that it means much ) but my point is , my father was dirt poor all his life , breaking his back on farms and building sites to put his kids through college so we never had to go through it . 
  i see what the left is doing to europe and i do n't like it , i 'm not anti-left entirely , one of my favorite public figures would be bill maher , we do n't agree on a lot but his approach and his degree of `` leftyness '' is still a reasonable one . 
  the left , communism and radical islamism are all in the same bed . 
  i am far right , fuck yourself commie, 
  i know it is commie . 
   is n't it unfair to the 199 other ones to act like they are criminals too ? 
  yes , but lets also say you have airline a , it is 5 times more likely to crash , their chance of crashing is 0.5 % instead of 0.1 % . 
  =  that means that if you take 200 flights , statistically 1 would crash . 
  is n't it unfair to treat the other 199 flights like they will crash too ? 
  as for your second point , i totally agree with all of it , that 's total nonsense and in the vernacular of my youth `` that 's fuckin retarded '', 
  your a total liberal ( the bad kind not the bill maher kind ) and i would venture to say even a socialist . 
  your opinions are shit and not based on reality . 
  you 're so stunning and brave to live in the repressive authoritarian racist hell hole which is modern europe . 
  i tip my ushanka to you . 
  which would you rather have fill your house , rabbits or lions ? 
  you do n't know the lions yet so to deny them entry based on their species ? 
  ** it is unfair and it is wrong **, 
  there is a reason muslims are generally disliked in europe much more so , than say , the japanese , mormons , sikhs or canadians , right or wrong `` prejudice '' does n't just come out of thin air . 
  back in the 70 's and 80 's irish people in the uk got a lot of shit for being terrorists , right or wrong its understandable if you have a specific group which is identifiable by some unique characteristic it only makes sense to have a closer look at that group than others , i ca n't understand why this is so hard for people to understand . 
  do you think atheists should be vetted for religious extremism ? 
  it just does n't make sense . 
  it was a professor who said it http://www.irishcentral.com/news/politics/professor-believes-the-irish-will-be-an-ethnic-minority-in-ireland-by-2050 i ca n't get anything better than that atm because i 'm at work . 
  heres another its in german so i dont understand any of it but what the hell https://www.destatis.de/bevoelkerungspyramide/index.html#!v=6, 
  more importantly they 've given donegal to the brits you geographically inaccurate fuckers !, 
  so we should deal with americas problem ? 
  these refugees are not our responsibility . 
  if you feel they are , open your home to as many as can fit if it makes you happy , otherwise stop trying to insinuate we have some duty to protect them . 
  look this is just an isolated incident of a traumatized teenager , it 's nothing to worry about , child services will give him so = me counseling and everything will be ok . 
  honest question here , and well i hope i do n't get banned but . 
  for countries like the uk , sweden and germany which are estimated to have their `` native '' populations a minority by 2050 , is germany still germany if the population has been replaced with somalians , syrians and turks ? 
  ireland is expected to have a majority population of chinese by 2050 ( not that i mind chinese people go pretty much un-noticed here ) but i just think to myself , if i traveled to iran and everyone living there was say ... a scouser , it would be a massive disappointment . 
  again i 'm not saying its a good or bad thing i 'm just trying to get a feel how germans/swedes and brits feel about it . 
  i 'm not racist so i have no problem deleting this comment if its gunna get me banned !, 
  * [ laughs nervously and sweats while looking at the german ] * haha yeah ah um good plan haha . 
  man did i ever say how much i love germany ? 
  screw dah iss a bleeedin ' jokeh, 
  also the chances of zuckerberg shooting it down is pretty small . 
   bloody brit detected, 
  looking at ireland alone ( as a catholic ) i would say these are no where near accurate . 
  omg germany is trying to expand their army it 's the nazis coming back !, 
  fucking germany !, 
  i knew all those pro brexit crowd were criminals !, 
  i agree here , while i am strongly in favor of religious freedom , ( and catholic coincidentally ) i 'm not going to get all ass blasted when the job i apply for , which clearly outlines it 's dress codes wo n't let me wear my cross , it 's a total media attention thing . 
  `` look i 'm being oppressed '' there 's a kiddies park close by that only lets kids under 12 in it , i 'm not going to scream agism and go to the media when they do n't let a long haired 23 year old man with a beard that looks like asian peoples pubes on the fuckin swings . 
   the power of germany would be balanced with a strong france . 
  lets not kid ourselves . 
  we 'll drown in downvotes but [ dont let go ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kog1iduevtg ), 
  you can draw what ever conclusions about the way i think of the eu that you like , just know that you 're totally inaccurate . 
  yeah this sub reddit is very geared towards pro-eu oppinions , that being said there are a lot of people here who admire the soviet union and communism , with people like that , you ca n't expect rational opinions . 
  one thing to keep in mind though , and it 's something i 'm guilty of myself , reddit and it 's users are in no way representative of the opinions of the general public , anti-eu views are becoming more and more popular . 
  i 'd use the example of ( purely out of lazyness to think of a better more apt one ) being in the reichstag in 1938 and wondering why everyone is a nazi . 
  sorry , i should have been more clear , what i mean is in it 's current form i wish it would go back to what it used to be say in the 70 's or 80 's obviously for them to back track is unlikely so if it collapsed and a new eu popped up i would lose any sleep !, 
  i want the current eu to collapse , its a lot more far reaching than what it needs to be . 
  economoic co-operation and schegen are fantastic but it 's been trying to get its tentacles into other parts of countries laws etfc and it just seems off . 
  am i the only one who is worried about the way the eu is going ? 
  it started off as what was suppose to be an economic co-operation zone and has now extended to governing laws on immigration etc. 
  while obviously these security pacts between different eu countries make sense i do n't think we necessarily need an army . 
  especially if germany has any more power over it than other countries like it does with the economic side of things , which , granted is because it is an economic power house , but having power over a military as well ? 
  worrying . 
  i do n't care, 
  nah far-right brings people together through the love of their people and nation . 
  lefties and commies do just divide people tho, 
  as an evil nazi i can confirm i love this show !, 
  and i suppose being called a lefty is any different ? 
  communism killed more people than any other ideology in recent history , recent contributions to human history , still rolls off me like water off a ducks back , just smile and nod and the idiots boys, 
   `` far-right '' they see it as an insult and use it as such , i just laugh , i am `` far-right '' and i 'm happy to be labelled so , doesnt bother me in the least . 
  are n't englishmen . . well the english who are decendants of normans and saxons ( not aghanis etc ) the same race as polish ? 
  also , with a title like this i would suspect black or arab englishmen to be the culprits because caucasian is a race and most europeans are caucasians so title kinda doesnt make sense tbh . 
  i know right ? 
  you 'd think the french authorities would investigate the family members of terrorists at this stage . 
   i 'm not sure what `` traditional '' is a euphemism for . 
  it 's a euphemism for traditional . 
   no rape epidemic because the ** women there know not to go outside alone . 
  ** syria ( outside of conflicted territory etc ) and lebanon do not have these problems , the western coast of syria is very mediterranean and has a strong western influence , most of the women , or in latakia at least , wear neither hijabs nor niqabs . 
  its more of an iraqi , afghan , pakistani and north african thing . 
  look at some of the music videos that have come out of syria in the last 20 years , they remind me of eastern euro pop from the 90s . 
  ** edit 2 : ** [ habibi bass ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv2y7gs6rho ) in fairness this probably isnt the best example but look how hot she [ is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33zd1c4qdis ), 
  thats how it was with the ira anyway , family and friends hiding people , spying giving info on troop movements and poi 's ( read women and children ) sometime in the 30 's my granny remembers 2 ira guys hiding in her house for a few hours and off they went . 
  i have a friend in latakia ( syria ) , one in a pro govt militia in iraq , and another guy in lebanon ( random adds to people i found through fb groups based off the war in syria ) they all say the same things `` you 're getting the criminals and islamists '' they laugh at europeans and think we are insane to handle this crisis the way we are . 
  my lebanese `` friend '' said they have 1 million syrians and that they have not noticed any kind of rape epidemic , when i asked him he laughed and said `` no we have no muslim rape gangs every family here '' ** edit : ** he laughed and said `` no we have no muslim rape gangs , almost every family here has an ak-47 so if the police do n't do their jobs then the family will take revenge so its in everyone 's best interest that the police arrest who they should regardless of religion ( lebanon is like 47 % christian and the majority muslim ) and according to him they live peacefully together side by side in lebanon for the most part ( much less tension and incidents than what we have here in eu ) my friend in latakia also said the same thing , he goes drinking with christians , we smokes hookah with his muslim friends ( he 's an atheist ex-muslim himself as are most of his family - he said this is accepted by his friends and has never had any kind of death threats because of it ) how ever ex-muslims in parts of europe have to live in fear because of the reaction they might get from their community . 
  if that does n't send massive bright red alarms off in your head well then something is wrong .
