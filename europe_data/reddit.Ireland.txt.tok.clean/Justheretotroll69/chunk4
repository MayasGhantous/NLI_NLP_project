  / u/rentalpan1 * lisa needs braces *, 
  wow he 's so salty and bitter , does he just follow you around or what ? 
  play hardball with the uk on brexit you say ? 
  well , the uk has already left , and many countries in the eu need the uk for trade so good sounds like shes lost already . 
  it 's only common sense , pity no one who had any power in the eu had the brain cells to put something like that into action . 
  it 's pretty sad if you think about it . 
  not so funny when the joke is about your past eh comrade ? 
  itt : paranoid people freaking out . 
  ireland has a massive foreign population from eastern europe . 
  ( 122,585 ( 2.7 % of the population ) according to 2011 census figures , making it the largest minority in the country . ), 
  they all came here in the last 13 or so years , we have had no issues with integration funnily enough ( very strange is n't it , that polish can fit in with us irish while holding onto their culture etc 0 hostility ) my eastern european friends are the only people left i can talk to about things going on in europe atm without tip toeing around the place on egg shells . 
  my friend wojtek will say something like `` send them all back home , they dont fit in or belong here in the eu '' where as myself , would have to say it a very very different way lest i risk being shouted down for being a racist , i 've seen how `` multicultural '' paris has become and well , it doesnt look like paris anymore . 
  this has happened to a lesser extent in germany , uk rest of europe . 
  even here in ireland you can already see the shift . 
  this * as you said * will not be happening in eastern bloc countries anytime soon and so i have been looking into possibly moving there . 
  ( either polska or czechia ) failing that i 'd move to the south in the usa where things are a little more traditional . 
  call me what ever you want i do n't honestly care , i just want to live among people who are similar to me and who i do n't have to deal with such a huge culture clash . 
  the poles are big into their family , drinking , food , religion with the exception of the last one this is more or less identical to the irish . 
  ask them if they want to rape 1 million german women between 8 and 80, 
  so something like 0.01 % of football hooligans are anti-semitic big deal we ca n't just keep painting all hooligans as anti-semitic thugs . 
  if they are with drawing their applications why the fuck is sweden paying them to leave as well ? 
  if you withdraw your application for asylum you should be deported asap . 
  it doesnt make sense to withdraw an asylum application i mean usually they 're sent by people fleeing death/imprisonment . 
  as far as i 'm aware none of these wars in mena have ended recently ( with would make sense to withdraw asylum application if that was the case ) so why else would large numbers of people suddenly withdraw an asylum application ? 
  could it be that they are liars , con artists and cheats ? 
  aka economic migrants ? 
  it would make so much more sense to create a coalition of me and eu countries to create `` safe zones '' around certain citys etc so that civillians can be safe and recieve aid in their own countries instead of making the dangerous journey here just to give up when the money dries up . 
  i do n't blame them , those countries are poor , do n't have many jobs and tend to not have the best social welfare systems in place as say germany . 
  from what i 've seen in the media and on reddit germany as a majority has no problems with refugees , why not just send them all there ? 
  it 's where they want to go . 
  sure didnt merkle even say there was `` no limit '' to the amount of refugees she would take ? 
  germans behave in a stupid naive almost child like way , giving the things they 've worked hard for and built up as a nation so easily and most of the migrants are just here for an easy life and free shit . 
  sounds like a match made in heaven . 
   relative of charlie hebdo attacker investigated for islamist ties = not news oh really ? 
  i think it is , things like this need to be made public knowledge . 
  if extremism is being spread by family members in stead of `` young disenfranchised muslims being radicalised online '' like we 're constantly told well then it may help up tackle terrorism even more . 
  your not a true communist . 
  hitler did not represent national socialism , they just did it wrong . 
  real national socialism has never been tried . 
  thats right they were just a puppet state , a situation that was forced on the poles by the commie rats in moscow . 
  ask any eastern european besides serbs and the `` minority '' populations of latvia and lithuania what they think of giving up more and more control of their nation piece by piece . 
  you and i both know it was a different beast back then , do n't be so disingenuous . 
  either i 'm not smart enough to realise when someone is mocking me or you just did a terrible job . 
  oh look , danes talking about violence and going places they do n't belong , remind you of anything eh boys ? 
  ( i 'm looking at you celtic union 13th century europe ? 
  big hairy guys on boats ? 
  yeah i still remember nordies ), 
  all being part of one big collective equal union . 
  sounds like a load of horse shit . 
  maybe it 's different in the celtic isles but i 'm irish first , a gael second celtic 3rd even so say i feel anything more than irish ever really is a stretch . 
  i would never want to become part of some soviet union , communism killed 94million ppl is the 20th century matey . 
  ** edit : ** also lol , have fun trying to convince poles that poland should be part of some huge union again . 
  protip : do n't do it in person , i went through a `` communist '' phase when i was 17 or so , and then i grew up but my point is my polish friends didnt take to anything communistic , and with good reason too . 
  european is not a nationality or nation and never will be kek . 
  sounds a bit too commie for myself . 
  i can see why none of our new friends here from syria want to stay in estonia . 
  if this is what estonians look like irl i think i can solve a few slavic troll stories . 
   berlin germany . 
  third reich :d old names are fun, 
  scots gael and irish is very very similar . 
  i do n't know if the google translate voices are still demonic and robotic but you should try translating ` hi how are you ' in both languages . 
  and into a third language and then back into inglish just to see if it goes all funny lol . 
  look if thats their religion who are we to judge , i think we should focus on those dangerous backwards christians and leave these poor people alone . 
  their just trying to live their lives , less islamophobia please people come on this is europe , not some backwards country like saudi arabia or iran where we 'll hang you off a crane by the neck for being different . 
  they also joined more recently and need the money more than the uk . 
  its what got us suckered into it . 
  `` we need to go after their familys '' - donald trump . 
  maybe a tad excessive in his words , more like a look into his immediate family to see if there could be an idea of what tipped him over the edge . 
  was he influenced by his parents ? 
  these kinds of questions should be asked it seems like common sense . 
  if you think ireland is in worse shape than turkey your out of your liberal yipped out mind . 
  not german turks , they are either turks or they are germans they can not be both . 
  the deciding factor is where their loyalties lay and i think from this it 's very clear who their priority is . 
   he is clearly making shit up what makes it clear ? 
  your accusation of the story being made up could be you clearly making shit up . 
  everyone i do n't like is a nazi, 
  what proof do you have its fake ? 
  and then shoot their children and build houses for their country men on top . 
  turkey is such a joke . 
  ok pls resond, 
  oi oi oi oi suka blyat , cheeki breeki tracksuit m8 , you look so fresh . 
  `` latvian '' guy in my college class ( both parents russian , born in latvia ) used to laugh and joke about how he and his other `` russian '' friends used to fight and beat up latvian guys on their own or small groups and how they `` used to make their legs weak with fear '' dude was a real fuckin prick . 
  ** edit : ** his sister was really really hot tho and i tried to nail her out of spite but she said i looked like too much of an arab and doesnt like long hair ahahaah, 
   but i am pretty convinced that you people what do you mean `` you people '' racist . 
  also i simply linked the video i didnt claim to know what they were chanting , get ur kebab out of its knot  deport all 3 million back to turkey please , we could use the economic boost . 
  lol , i dont care either way i do n't live in germany , tbh i want more migrants to come to europe because it will be funny to see how much more ridiculous sweden and germany will get . 
  i mean germany is riddled with terrorists and the swedes lets migrants rape their women and children lol and doesnt even deport them, 
   i mean what politician is 100 % honest thats like using adolf hitler as an example to show how we can all do mean things . 
  ho ho ho oh yeah top european banter lads , ha sure ill give it a go . 
  what about them brits ha ? 
  shower ' a cunce . 
  personally , i think that if your security services have to be put on guard because of the events in your `` minority '' immigrant population , then immigration may have gone either too far or has taken a wrong turn some where in regards to integration . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yqcifizopa like , how valuable are turkish immigrants that these type of events are some how worth it ? 
  who would have guessed that the prick behind the anti homo stuff was also a woman beating asshole . 
  exactly , its lie after lie . 
  before the coup its all `` the mosques are our barracks , the domes our helmets , the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers !! '', 
  arrest the reporters !, 
  during the `` coup '' he basically murders all his secular opposition , reports them as traitors , gets rid of more reporters and other people he doesnt like . 
  now that 90 % of the people left in turkey support erdogan and no one dare oppose him `` it 's no longer illegal to insult me '' why ? 
  because no one will .
