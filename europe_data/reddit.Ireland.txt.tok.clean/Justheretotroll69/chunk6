   no , i think it is an attempt to combat the effects of racism . 
  so , calling someone a person of colour combats `` the effects of racism '' more than calling them black ? 
  `` racist thugs '' arent english people and poles the same ethnicity ? 
  whites . 
  the first two words of the article would suggest to me that the perps were non white , or else self hating liberal whites . 
  shitty journalism . 
   it really does n't . 
  there is no evidence to support this anyway . 
  yes it does . 
  what about the black while woman ? 
   does it occasionally suck ? 
  sure . 
  you know what sucks more ? 
  racism . 
  life is not black and white , most times you have to pick the least shitty way to do things . 
  political correctness is just that . 
  i 'm sorry , are you trying to say the opposite of pc is racism ? 
  are you demented ? 
  im very right wing , we 're not some homogeneous group , dont label us all for the actions of a few . 
  haha, 
  i 'll take `` headlines that make you wan na shoot yourself for 1,000 '' bob, 
  we went to sweden and couldnt find any swedes, 
  hold on h\u00e5kon , we gettin you for dem viking boys, 
  i 'd be bitching and moaning sure , but i wouldnt be saying that the majority vote `` wasnt enough '' and that we needed a `` supermajority '' to actually keep the result . 
  `` oh we need more people to vote and have a higher majority '' what majority is accepable ? 
  its just pedantic and so typical of reddit, 
  the status quo is now that the uk is leaving the eu so you want your remain side to need a `` supermajority '' in order to actually remain in the eu ? 
   the result was far too close for a status quo change this big to go through . 
  you would n't be saying that if it was the other way around , you remainers here on reddit have done nothing but bitch and moan , you need to grow up and get over yourselves , democracy that doesnt fit with what you want is still democracy . 
  if ~ ~ germany ~ ~ the eu deals with this half as well as the migrant crisis we 're in for a total fucking shit storm . 
  no no no , this goes beyond the eu is the beginning of the celtic-anglo superstate . 
  once the isles belong to us , then it 's pay back time for / r/norway, 
  our little isles are all over the feckin place , now with the help of scotland and wales is the time for us to spring a surprise invasion on england and get them back for all they 've done !, 
  then we can back stab scotland , take their land too and then go after wales . 
  we 'll have the `` irish isles '' someday !, 
   there is no islamic hate speech , lol  the west has a long standing history of bloodshed and genocide . 
  lol  what have muslims as a group ever done wrong ? 
  lol  i just love how your own racism blinds you to basic logic . 
  ding ding ding lol we have a troll !, 
  lol i love how i am pro-banning of radical islamist hate speech and then you call me a racist , while being racist yourself and try and change the image of hate speech loving islamist fuck tards to poor innocent hard working immigrants . 
  what a piece of shit . 
  hahaha talks about `` teh ebil ignorent right wing racists ''  ca n't even tell which flag he 's looking at . 
   if only you could listen to your own disgusting racism . 
  stopped reading right there . 
   the ar-15 that killed 50 people was sold in a normal shop - like groceries . 
  ( the `` checks '' that are made are joke ) a country that will give africa the ak-47 , a country that has been bombing the middle east and supplying weapons to `` rebel '' factions in the middle east for the last 30 ! + ? 
  years ? 
  is n't it odd that of all people in the world , they do n't want ** you ** to be armed ? 
  relax hans , he 's not attacking the poor defenceless brown man he 's just making a sarcastic joke . 
  `` preaching '' nazism is also illegal in many places , toxic ideologies are toxic . 
  good to see bulgaria bring their law in line with common sense , other european nations would do well to follow their example !, 
   like trump said , nice fitting your narrative in there !, 
  i do n't care weather they stay or go tbh , and i do n't know much about the referendums politics , but the satlyness in this thread is bretty gud : dd, 
   eligible for upward of 50 000 euro in eu grants . 
  ooh dem tastey eu grants , please do n't post this tho , you 'll interfere with the salt levels in this thread . 
  integration doesnt bring down their numbers . 
  even if 1 million german males just spawned from no where between the ages for 15 and 30 it would be the same . 
  if this was a european nation ( white non muslim ) it would be blasted all over the news 24/7 and people say there is no bias against white people , when one kid showed up drowned on our shores it was stuck in our faces for weeks yet this turk can literally gun them down and i have n't seen it on / r/worldnews or elsewhere on reddit . 
  agreed, 
  another good point is voters , make them citizens and they 'll vote for you even if they know very little about you . 
  after all who would n't vote for a man/woman who gave them free shit and then a job ? 
  its literally 2016, 
   they attacked protesters lol, 
  well i guess if they are supporting the leave vote , the whole leave side must be racist neo-nazis eh ? 
  suuuch a biased sub . 
  some say its to islamise europe or to bring in millions of young men from 3rd world countries to `` breed '' with european women . 
  thats a bit tin foil hatty tho , i personally think it 's to flood the market with cheap , uneducated workers to drive down wages - that coupled with some of those `` trade '' agreements the us and eu bureaucrats are trying to force on us , i can see how it would make sense . 
  worrying ` climate of take illegal immigrants who dont integrate and nobody wants ' in europe , says regular joe about un, 
  thank god we 're not in russia !, 
  lol troll confirmed, 
  dont be such a stick in the mud !, 
  banter  rules, 
  the polices job is to keep the peace and make sure people are safe . 
  these people are safe happy and cheering , no one , police or otherwise would want to break up this banter !, 
  in countries around europe i often seen violence between their police and large crowds , it seems how ever that once the irish come along , with our happiness and good spirited banter police are just like , `` okay these guys arent a threat , lets join in ! '', 
  it makes me so happy to see the reputation irish fans are making for themselves !, 
  thought as much , israel seems to care about its people . 
  kek , the sad thing is im not trolling . 
  you mean like an extermination camp ? 
   it was an official ceremony in honour of the couple of policemen killed in their home a few days ago by a muslim extremist . 
  havent heard a thing about this , havent seen it on reddit . 
  are muslim extremest attacks now so common in france no one bothers reporting them or are people deliberately censoring these things to act as damage control for islam ? 
  the majority of french people are germans ( from what i see on reddit ) are utter cowards . 
  i bet the irish army could take your country and you wouldnt dare say a word in case you were seen as intolerant . 
  get this country into the eu !, 
  what do you think would happen in israel if a group of palestinians were found to be grooming , molesting and gang raping israeli jewish girls on not one , but 2 occasions that made international news ? 
  ( i know it sounds like a leading question but i literally know 0 jews or israelis and want to get a realistic answer here ), 
  they should have a few children by the time they are 15 at least one anyway . 
  its sad how the media twisting things has made me not trust them . 
  when i hear `` asian '' i think pakistani , afghani iraqi etc muslims . 
  when i hear that the race/description of somebody involved in a mass rape/terrorist attack is withheld i always think again , they 're middle eastern muslims . 
  when our lads were over there blowing up pregnant women and old men in boats for the freedom of their nation , the media never withheld nationalities or anything like that because they were white . 
  the media does it to try and not stoke the fires of racial and religious tensions but they end up just making people cynical . 
  i feel like these kind of crimes would never happen in the us , you guys are a lot let pc and thats a good thing . 
  is it racist if i notice a pattern ? 
  why is there always a pattern with these scandals ? 
  muslim men of a `` minority '' background , raping and molesting white girls . 
  ** edit : ** just in case i get banned , i 'm not racist , its just odd that every time these scandels pop up its always muslim men and white girls , its never a group of muslim girls being molested by other muslims or even by a group of ethnic english, 
   muslim  white there are white muslims , islam is not a race its an ideology . 
  sorry no ones listening it doesnt fit peoples narratives , they hear a woman was shot and straight away try to push their agendas .
