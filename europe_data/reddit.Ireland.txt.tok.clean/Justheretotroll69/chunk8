  i do n't agree but lets , agree to disagree, 
   i think you 'd be in for a rude awakening if you think iranian oriental christians will adapt easier . 
  why do you think that ? 
   it 's just that its weird to go out of your way to help a group that allegedly will adapt easier it 's not weird , they are christians , i am a christian . 
   would n't they be the ones who would need less help than the rest ? 
  they will adapt easier and i wo n't have to change any part of my life to accommodate them . 
  they are not targeted for being a religious minority amongst the migrants, 
  yeah this is exactly my reasoning , as well as that i would n't have to change my lifestyle or anything i do in order to house them without difficulties, 
  4 ten thousands in fact !, 
   doctor in germany . 
  yeah , i have this mole on my back ... 
  lol are you ** seriously ** arguing that the fact they even exist in those countries is some kind of positive ? 
  hahaha do you realise how much of a racist bigot that makes you sound like ?? 
  it 's like you 're saying `` muslims are n't as bad and violent as you make them out to be , they let religious minorities exist in their countries '' fucking hell man, 
   many people practice christianity as secretly and non threateningly as possible . 
  i could n't even wear this silver cross around my neck in many countries where christianity has a great history , please do n't pretend like they are the same thing . 
   go back to / r/the _ donald when ever people say `` you 're a racist/nazi/bigot '' ( something reddit likes to say / r/the _ donald is full of ) it automatically makes me think they are dumb children who ca n't really form an argument, 
   iranian christians damn , tough break , is there a way someone can go about opening their home to specifically christian refugees ? 
  i know all refugees are having a hard time but it seems minority refugees , refugees of a minority religion rather , can have that little bit more problems , i 'd like to maybe look into something like that ? 
  i 'm not in germany but maybe you know of something ? 
  i 'm not a racist or anything but i feel like taking christians ( as a christian myself ) would be a lot easier in terms of culture shock for two already really different people . 
  i 'm talking about differences bigger and more meaningful that you liking cod while your neighbour likes sport, 
   dude i am from the balkans . 
  i can tell you first-hand what holding old grudges creates . 
  and most euros hold some kind of grudge against someone , listen i 'm 22 and so most people i have contact with are college aged liberals , irish people my age are like , really super liberal , #openborders type liberal , anti-racist anti-fa pro-refugee ( in terms of the current crisis ) mdma swallowing pill popping artsy types . 
  even they were absolutely beyond butthurt when britian offered to pay some of our debts , they started saying things like `` this is ireland not the uk , here go the brits with their imperialism again '' these comments from `` borders are racist '' types . 
  ireland and englands history is terrible but not unique , i imagine it 's the same with the balkans and in ex-soviet countries with the russians and poles vs germans , brits vs french etc etc. 
  no matter how progressive you are these things always bubble to the surface , hell look at the identity politics and racial tention in the us right now and they have been a very very diverse country since it 's inception , they 've lived together for hundreds of years and still black vs. white is an issue . 
   you mentioned tribes and then kingdoms and then countries . 
  tribes grow and assimilate other similar people to eventually become kingdoms or what ever and then nations , it happens naturally over time , you can not force it or else you get a situation like 1970 's sa and look at what happened in the rwandan civil war if you had seperate countries with all the hutus in one and the tutsi 's in the other that could have been avoided , it 's why there is talk of possibly dividing syria among religious lines nowadays . 
  yeah , probably be better off with an assault rifle since grenades attacks are a thing in sweden now, 
   parochial you keep saying that word , its nothing to do with religion, 
  thanks , i 'm not the most articulate or smartest person but it should be obvious that a `` federal '' one government europe is absolutely a terrible idea . 
   why is ireland suddenly the climax of civilization and culture and governance on your island ? 
  the same way you are talking about federal europe , irish peoples spoke about the uk and a united ireland . 
  i 'm not sure if your just being purposefully ignorant but let me explain something to you i assumed was common knowledge . 
  nations form around ethnic , tribal , religious and cultural lines , people who feel as part of a group , group together to live in a community because the similarities between them give them a feeling of belonging their similar life style do not conflict or cause trouble and everyone generally accepts that whats best for the majority is what should be striven for . 
  they then get large enough that they can no longer be ruled by chieftains , or what have you and so form local , regional and national governments . 
  while they may be from very different tracts of land , they are still part of the same nation and still share the same culture . 
  thank you for bringing up northern ireland , it 's the perfect example . 
  white irish people who were almost identical fought in open war fare because they belonged to a different * denomination * of the ** same ** religion and had different ideas on where their loyalties lay . 
  this caused whats known as `` the troubles '' they did n't share a religion , they shared a negative history and thus the island was seperated not only among political beliefs but also on culture and religion . 
  keeping all thins in mind , i 'll let you be the first one to tell the polish that germany will now decide how certain things work in poland given their , * colourful * history . 
  maybe they 're trying to be edgy and enlightened ? 
  * wow it 's so shocking that this pack of wolves would not accept this house cat as their own wowowow *, 
   a federal government will uphold those , and let the member states deal with more particular issues . 
  * let us worry about the big picture , you just concentrate on the small stuff little guy , * i would never vote for a federal government and tbh if it came to it i would actually register to vote and vote against staying in the eu if the opportunity arose , it started out great , but now it 's tentacles are reaching their way into every facet of how countries run themselves and i do n't like it . 
  i have no problem with european co-operation especially on a economical if we could keep it to the model we had in the 70 's when ireland joined i would have no problem . 
  i like how you changed my analogy to suit your own argument . 
  this thing of people in brussels to me reminds me of the soviet union , one super state trying to govern vastly different peoples and look how that turned out . 
  it only works in places where the culture and traditions and lifestyle of people is relatively similar i.e the us was able to be unified into one giant superstate because most of them were descendants of english , german or french immigrants who over a few hundred years developed a common culture . 
  maybe you think europeans are all fairly similar but i beg to differ , lets see how happy the irish are when the british start telling them what to do or the poles when the germans tell them how to run their countries . 
  whats good for the goose is n't good for the gander . 
   country who the hell cares what nationality they are . 
  i do and so do many others , it makes no sense to have foreigners making laws for us . 
  it would be like a basket ball team hired a rubgy coach while they might have a general idea of what * could * work the more detailed points and whats actually best for the team would be better dictated by a basket ball coach, 
   what you think that people from brussels wont care about ireland or something ? 
  maybe maybe not , they certainly wo n't care about it as much as someone from ireland . 
   i literally do not understand this argument . 
  i guess your just too smart to understand a pleb like me  there is no need to understand every irish issue to deal with things like roaming charges and freedom of movement . 
  yeah sure i mean like , we 'll make laws for people we do n't know or understand or who did n't elect us because that makes sense . 
  ** up next for bulgaria 's presidential election : ** a 24 year old brazilian janitor , a 37 year old texan rancher and 63 year old turkish kebab owner . 
   barring some 100 million dead in various wars yes , by all means . 
  because there are no other reasons for war . 
   in that case why not only dublin people who have lived in dublin making laws for the citizens of dublin to follow ? 
  there 's little difference between people living in dublin and say kerry than there is between kerry and namur . 
  i saw bigot and stopped reading your comment , i 'm not here to argue just explaining what he meant, 
   whats the difference between people from brussels and people from ireland ? 
  people from ireland are from ireland and understand ireland and its needs better than anyone in brussels . 
   like they were born 300kms away but the other guy who you dont know either was born only 100km so its pefectly fine and logical . 
  come off it now and stop acting the fool, 
   that did wonders for europe over the last 1500 years . 
  i know you meant that ironically , but actually it has worked wonderfully for the last 1500 years . 
   so if it is european parliament members making those laws you would be fine ? 
  they are also elected and a number are from your country ? 
  only irish people qho have lived in ireland should be able to make laws irish people have to follow, 
   why do you not mind people in dublin making those laws ? 
  because they were elected by the people living in my country to do so . 
   do you think you are more connected with your nation state because of historical reasons ? 
  historical , ethnic , traditional , same language and living in the same country understanding how the irish work and whats best for us . 
  i think as long as the eu would be something that only affected trade i 'm happy , i do n't like people in brussels or france or germany dictating to us about what laws we should or should n't pass , taking or not taking migrants . 
  etc, 
  this is a pretty cool thing for a sub to do, 
  ok , well time to start resetting my passwords more often then . 
  it 's kind of funny is a desperate kind of way how banks continually fuck us up the ass and get away with it over and over and over again, 
   you can pretend it 's racists , but when a group of blackish guys starts to grope and pickpocket you in the middle of the night , while you 're probably a bit drunk since , you know , it 's new year 's eve , there 's no way you can later positively identify who attacked you , let alone differentiate whose hand it was that was doing the sexual assaulting and whose was doing the pickpocketing . 
  exactly my thoughts , i mean while no conviction should be given without proof , if they get away with this it will happen again , and when the native population will see their young girls and wifes/sisters being raped/sexually assaulted with no justice from the government , shit will get real bad , real fast . 
   claims legitimacy . 
  they were dropped because the victim could n't identify the culprit . 
  kind of scary to think that if you sexually assault/molest/rape even girls as young as 14 in a big enough group you can get away with it . 
  i understand the logic and obviously no convictions should be given without proof , but the idea that gangs can rape and not be identified is very worrying to me . 
   what does this conviction ( or lack therof ) has to do with being an islamophobe or an islam lover or whatever ? 
  he 's saying that even tho he is biased against muslims he still respects and accepts the decision to drop the charge due to lack of evidence . 
  they call them `` areas where police , fire and ambulance crews as well as native swedes and unaccompanied women should not travel through areas '', 
  exactly , i mean i always try to put it into those terms , you do n't let just anyone into your house but even college kids who throw a house party will throw out trouble makers . 
  if you let someone stay at your house for free and they start telling you the couch is n't good enough , the food is n't what they have at home , they now control the tv and what ever you 'd kick them right out . 
  to be honest i 'm not against refugees but this is ridiculous , all single fighting aged males need to be sent back , anyone whos not from syria or iraq needs to be sent back . 
  anyone caught harassing people or breaking laws needs to be sent back , if we do n't know where they came from then sent them back to their point of origin . 
  we need people in north africa destroying smugglers boats because they tell these people to get into european waters , signal for help and then sink their boat .
