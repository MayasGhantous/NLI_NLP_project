my mam calls it `` char '' . 
  they already had that in the 60s , it was called `` batman '' . 
  first irish pubs , then eurovision , now football fans . 
  we 're slowly taking over the affable areas of society . 
  can someone explain what a confidence vote is ? 
  is this a meme or did you actually get the country wrong ? 
  i 've only ever heard that said by americans , at least out loud . 
  so \u0103 is a schwa ? 
  finally opening the door to the modern age . 
  maybe soon we can even vote in referendums ; it was infuriating that my country gave me no voice regarding my right to marry in the 2015 referendum . 
   the concert of europe eurovision ? 
  i 'm from a foreign patch between vermont and alaska . 
  apparently that makes me ... canada ? 
   you can not use any already existing language within the union , all other members would see it as that country trying to make the eu its personal influence sphere . 
  could you * imagine * ireland or malta making a power play in the eu , though ? 
  in fairness , this is less about the german people and more about the government . 
  the cdu has been in power since 2005 , and they specifically oppose same-sex marriage , voting against any bills that attempt to legalise it . 
  angela merkel even went on the record in 2015 to say that she personally does n't agree with it :  i do n't want discrimination and [ i want ] equality , but i make a difference at some point . 
  [ ... ] for me , personally , marriage is a man and a woman living together . 
  public polling has been pretty consistently in favour of it , though , as are the other major parties , so i imagine it would go through if we had a government without a cdu/csu majority . 
   if italy is forced out of the eurozone what 's going on there ? 
  i have n't been following italy . 
   and the ~ ~ red dog ~ ~ fox because we all know foxes are just dogs in disguise . 
  one of my goals in life is to have a band called `` l\u00e9igh anois '' and have each album be cuid a , cuid b , etc. 
  the donegal accents were the highlights of our jc/lc aurals . 
  it 's good that they played them twice , because we would all , without exception , crack up laughing as soon as they started . 
  if only it had stayed like that . 
  same here . 
  it 's become one of those things that i pine for , for no other reason than not being able to get it here . 
  ( see also : tk red lemonade , lilt , lucozade ), 
  it is in germany . 
  i do n't even have to deal with the p60 , i just get my monthly salary statement from my employer with the deductibles listed on it . 
  not sure if sick burn or genuine surprise . 
  defo not underrated in germany , it 's their top spanish holiday destination , much like the canaries would be for irish people . 
  there 's a running joke that german is more useful to know than spanish on mallorca . 
  we 're avoiding telling the cdu about that particular detail until after the vote . 
  then we 're going to eat them . 
  standing on my feet ^ ^ ^ how ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ amazing ^ ^ ^ bot ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ thing, 
  curved bananas ? 
  best eurovision selection of all . 
  often better than the eurovision itself . 
  i was cheering that ireland finally won something other than eurovision ... then i put it up full screen and saw it was iceland at # 1 . :(, 
  at least we can reclaim graham norton . 
  his sass will not leave with the uk . 
  ireland : come for the craic , stay for the external shell company . 
  how do you know they 're not also fighting their own battles ? 
  just because some countries have n't legalised it does n't mean people are n't fighting for it , or that the people do n't want it . 
  ( look at germany ; gay marriage is consistently favoured by the public , but the conservative government refuse to even have a referendum about it . ), 
  plus , western european countries like france would generally be used as successful templates to learn from , so i can see why people would have a vested interest in helping to ensure this is still the case , to aid their battles back home . 
  i know i 'm just being pedantic , but germany has n't broken apart since it became a federation . 
  you ca n't vote in ireland unless you were ordinarily resident there within the last 18 months . 
  except for presidential elections . 
  source : am disgruntled citizen living abroad for longer than 18 months . 
  i remember waiting at a crossing next to a policeman , and he told me he was jealous because he had to cross the `` correct '' way ( i.e. 
  wait for green ) but we normal people could just cross if no cars were coming . 
  i guess even the police take common sense into account . 
  i 'd argue that darby o'gill and the little people has done us over the worst . 
  thanks , disney . 
  actual immigrants ? 
  genuine , pleasant , seem quite happy to be here . 
  often sporting an alarming lack of volume control , but i suppose that 's part of the charm . 
  as an immigrant myself ( ireland =  germany ) who works in an international company , i split people into category a ( do n't integrate at all or reluctantly ; stay in own-language-speaking circles ) and category b ( make the effort to learn and integrate ) . 
  americans tend to be evenly split between those two just as much as anyone else ; i know plenty of british , french and spanish people who 've lived here for years and still do n't speak a word of german . 
  it 's not really something i 'd consider an american thing . 
  ( i have met a decent amount of america fuck yeah people , but they tend to just be tourists . 
  i met one a while ago who was convinced europe was being overtaken by muslims , and the revolution was imminent . 
  bless his misguided heart . ), 
   my semi-detached has five bedrooms for example jesus . 
  south side ? 
  the part about blasphemy gets me every time . 
  oh , ireland , never change . 
  ^ ^ ^ * but ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ do ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ change , ^ ^ ^ you 're ^ ^ ^ embarrassing ^ ^ ^ us, 
  is it ? 
  at least where i 'm from , indian food only popped up in the last ten years or so . 
  and red lemonade . 
  the major tea brands in ireland have this ( mostly true ) stereotype . 
  if you drink lyons , you 're from dublin . 
  if you drink barry 's , you 're from elsewhere in the country , notably cork . 
  if you drink bewley 's , you 're lying . 
  the irish times * most notably , along with the irish examiner . 
  ^ ^ * ^ ^ not ^ ^ to ^ ^ be ^ ^ confused ^ ^ with ^ ^ the ^ ^ times 's ^ ^ irish ^ ^ edition which one you read ( much like which tea you drink ) mostly depends on which part of the country you 're living in . 
  the lack of a gendered article is the real killer . 
  there 's no convenient way of learning a word 's gender like you can in other languages ; you just have to hope you hear it in a context where the presence/lack of a s\u00e9imhi\u00fa gives it away . 
  maidin ( morning ) =  dawn - midday tr\u00e1thn\u00f3na ( afternoon/evening ) =  midday - dusk o\u00edche ( night ) =  dusk - dawn, 
  la , glendale and ... salt lake city . 
  apparently `` drinking fountain '' swung me over to the latter . 
  given that it very technically counts , i 'm going to say northern ireland , because the ulster dialect of irish is hilarious . 
  otherwise , barely anyone outside ireland knows we have a language , let alone speaks it . 
  to give the standard irish answer , `` anyone but the uk '' . 
  realistically speaking it 'd have to be northern ireland , given that there are already provisions for them switching allegiance from the uk to ireland if they choose to . 
  salt and vinegar if they 're steakhouse chips , nothing otherwise . 
  [ do n't make unnecessary journeys !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi5oxj04_8s ) there was a storm in galway and poor teresa had to give a report in the middle of it . 
  went viral all over ireland and even outside . 
  enter the good people of ireland with [ a ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwaghz_q8os ) [ million ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzx3meyont8 ) [ remixes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuom6defwlu ) . 
  consistently one of my favourite eurovision countries . 
  80 euro and it lasts 10 years . 
  additionally you have the option of getting a passport card , which is 35 euro and lasts 5 years ( or until your passport book expires ) . 
  i was actually considering having this as the op example , but it 's not as cut and dry as the hopak . 
  definitely agree , though , ireland has much more of a tea obsession .
