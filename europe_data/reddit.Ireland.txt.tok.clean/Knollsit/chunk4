  i think the same of your pro-eu perspective but cheers for taking the time to pointlessly tell me you disagree with me on a day old post . 
  very insightful . 
  unlike most irish i have n't forgotten about the lisbon treaty . 
  the eu is anti-democratic . 
  we already know what the replies will be . 
  the lefties will say `` oh everything is going great !, 
  just a hiccup here and there !, 
  we can do it ! '', 
  and people on the right will say `` it 's going terribly and is a mess . 
  send them back . '', 
  the question is unanswerable . 
  you just have to see for yourself with your own eyes and draw your own conclusions . 
  i want it to be nonexistent . 
  all nations back to independent control of everything including their national borders . 
  i 'd imagine this will be a highly controversial comment here though as i see anyone else that said anything similar got downvoted to hell . 
  you lads should n't ask the questions if you do n't want to hear all sides of the issue . 
  in monaghan the older crowd calls it `` bob '' sometimes . 
  `` it cost me a lock of bob '' . 
  lock meaning `` a few '' . 
  makes for good craic, 
  i love the irish ladies , think we have the best looking wans in all of europe, 
  as some fringe ideology followed by people that do n't bathe . 
  i live right on the border so i get caught in between the irish & uk service . 
  both sets of service typically gets no better than a single bar and less than 3g . 
  i 'd love to see hurling or gaelic football take off outside of the irish communities . 
  that anthem is pretty amazing . 
  i second bringing it back . 
  lyrics make an anthem . 
  nothing beats belting it out during a footy match for example . 
  fields of athenry . 
  outside of dublin and other cities we have n't recovered . 
  the celtic tiger barely visited places like monaghan to begin with sadly . 
  my complaint is that it morphed into a superstate-like organisation without much input from the citizens of the member nations . 
  much of the `` integration '' was done through treaties there were just stuff through national parliaments without giving the people a voice . 
  and any time the people were given a voice and the outcome was something the eu did n't agree with they just forced it through anyway ( french & dutch rejection of nice , irish rejection of lisbon and forced to revote ) . 
  it 's just all so forced and anyone that speaks out gets shouted down as a `` nazi '' or a `` populist '' . 
  the united states . 
  so many waves of irish have made the states their new home and the irish communities over there are still close to ireland . 
  you must be very tolerant if you want to `` confront '' opposing viewpoints . 
  what utter nonsensical shite . 
  `` no voters '' . 
  i 'm from ireland , we did n't get a chance to vote on anything . 
  you have n't a clue mate . 
  i still would n't call fg or ff right wing . 
  ff is more big tent these days since attempting to repair their shattered image post-collapse and fg are fairly middle of the road with right leanings on social issues . 
  centre-right but not right wing . 
  i think it would be fair to say ireland does n't have an actual viable `` right wing '' party instead of saying fg and ff are right wing . 
  who 's `` right wing '' ? 
  fine gael and finna fail are pretty centrist ( except on a few social issues ) and both are pro-eu , if that 's who you 're referring to . 
  ireland does n't really have a viable actual right wing , it 's either fairly centre or centre-left/left wing parties with the clout . 
  a lot of people do n't feel like putting up with whiney snowflakes telling them that their feelings got hurt due to the outcome of the referendum . 
  i think you just need to get over it to be honest . 
  i do n't mean to sound harsh but it 's the truth . 
  the irish army does n't constantly recruit from what i remember . 
  there 's really no need for us to have a constant flow of new recruits . 
  still does n't mean they do n't call themselves south africans or americans . 
  `` northern irish '' is n't an ethnicity either . 
  the protestants in the republic mostly consider themselves irish , rightfully so . 
  all i 'm saying is i consider the protestants & unionists in the north irish as well . 
  you mean the same people that have been on the island for hundreds of years ? 
  what do you call white people that live in south africa ? 
  south africans . 
  what do you call people that left the states from england to colonise the us ? 
  americans so now what do you call the protestants that left to attempt to colonise ireland ? 
  i view people from the north of ireland as irish because we 're all on the island of ireland . 
  i 'm obviously biased but whether they like it or not they 're more irish than british in my eyes at least . 
  ah but it is a fair reflection of the sub . 
  check how often they whinge about right leaning posters . 
  more than one post reached the front page of the sub . 
  check the comment sections of any political post on the sub , you 'll also see the lefty bias with anything near a centre-right comment towards the bottom . 
  aye , there are clueless yanks that pop in from time to time spewing politics but most of the time that is n't the case . 
  [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/search?q=right+wing&amp;restrict_sr=on ), 
  * holds back twitch * happy early st patty 's day !, 
  * twitches uncontrollably *, 
  that 's the exact post i had in mind too when i mentioned slagging off . 
  r/ireland gets heaps of yanks coming over and i 've seen a fair bit of stupid questions & amp ; posts on there but the irish do n't really tolerate it so those posts stay at 0 and the op gets slagged off usually . 
  as to your first point , at the end of the day almost all of the country specific subs , and reddit as a whole is n't really based in reality because the site has a mostly left-heavy slant . 
  ireland for example has both centre-right parties wielding a lot of clout within in government but you 'd never know that from the opinions expressed on the ireland sub . 
  brexit is another topic where you 'd have thought the remain side would have won 80 % to 20 % based on the opinion of reddit pre-referendum . 
  tl ; dr this site is n't a fair gauge of reality . 
  aye that 's one of them . 
  there are a few more like it too . 
  voted to the front page of the sub , think it even reach r/all . 
  r/ireland is another far-left sub . 
  they regularly upvote `` why do right leaning people post here ? '', 
  threads . 
  edit : [ proof ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/5d99i7/regulars_of_rireland/?ref=search_posts ), 
  as an outsider i was wondering what exactly did `` denazification '' entail ? 
  i can imagine signage and a lot of stuff to do with nazi era germany was washed away but what would the average german post-1945 have been put through during the process ? 
  the best prostitutes , tremendous prostitutes . 
  rt\u00c9 is the state provider . 
  of course they agenda push . 
  everything is pro-eu from them 24/7 just like how bbc was agenda pushing with their coverage in opposition to brexit . 
  there is n't any unbiased outlets in ireland . 
  they all agenda push no matter the outlet . 
  they are all anti-trump regardless as to their leaning though . 
  almost all of the outlets make cnn in the states look balanced . 
  german prostitute ? 
  come to kazakhstan . 
  we have best in all of region .
