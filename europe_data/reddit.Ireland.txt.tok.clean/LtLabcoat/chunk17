   i believe ireland also bailed out bonds held by european banks for their benefit , which the entire irish populace was against . 
  everything you just said is * technically * true , but very dishonest . 
  specifically : 1 . 
  there were european bank chains , yes , but the banks themselves were in ireland . 
  edit : either that , or you 're referring to that irish banks owed a lot of debt to european banks , so you 're counting that as bailing out european banks . 
  it was for the bank 's benefit , but also for the country 's benefit as a whole . 
  the irish populace was largely against it ( not entirely , but pretty close ) except for the actual economists , who 's opinions are the only ones actually worth something . 
  economists agreed not bailing out the banks was suicidal . 
  there 's an entire conversation in response to his post pointing out how . 
  how did you miss it ? 
   last time i checked our official papers , at least those i 've read , do not mention gender . 
  did you not even read the article ? 
  * biological * fact ? 
  the courts did n't do anything because they decided the amount of effort required to change all the laws was n't worth it , not that there 's no such thing as intersex people . 
  what the heck are you thinking of ? 
  society is a lot simpler when there 's no complicated people in it . 
  what emergency procedures could be life-threatening if used on the wrong sex ? 
  can we * please * not have this thread turn into what / r/worldnews 's did where people used the thread to argue for/against changing gender being legally recognised despite this having nothing to do with changing gender ? 
  the northern irish wo n't , but the brits will . 
  they 've been looking for a reason to get rid of ni for years , and they 're not going to just abandon this opportunity now because it requires a physically impossible giant saw . 
   idk man . 
  i 'm american and i honestly think this guy is much smarter than people give him credit for . 
  his uncle was an mit physics professor , his sister is a federal judge ( really tough job to get ) ... he 's conservatively worth at least a few billion . 
   he managed to become the most powerful man in the world . 
  ... and his talent is in business and marketing . 
  and not science or politics or any field that involves learning to listen to experts . 
  i do want to emphasise that . 
  when it comes to business/marketing , i have no problem with someone saying he 's a genius ( although i would n't go that far myself ) . 
  but being a genius in one area does n't mean you 're smarter in other areas too . 
  in fact , i 'd argue the fact that he dedicated his life to non-political areas means he 's * less * capable of being a president than the average person on this sub , because the average person here has the time and inclination to discuss political issues as a hobby . 
   and when push comes to shove , he does n't actually do any of the stupid stuff he says he will . 
  was this before or after he banned us residents from several middle eastern countries ? 
  or when he proposed a budget that cuts back on things nearly everyone was in favour of ( nasa , pbs , epa ) in favour of military ? 
  or what about his healthcare proposal that was worse than obamacare even for the people that hated obamacare ? 
  [ or this whole fiasco about still trying to build the wall ? 
  ] ( http://nordic.businessinsider.com/government-shutdown-border-wall-obamacare-funding-deal-2017-4?r=us&amp;ir=t ) at this point , it 's pretty clear that his * actual * policies are more bad than good . 
   british nationalism is inherently not ethnic and is more tolerant . 
  northern ireland would like to have a word with you about that . 
  the legal reason is that they 're the same country so the eu does n't get involved . 
  the actual reason is that scotland is the only british country that offers free education , so to prevent all british students just going to scotland , they made the cost for them the same as other british universities . 
  except for the british . 
  seriously , there 's an actual exception to scottish universities that they price non-scottish british and northern irish as if they 're not part of the eu . 
   65\u00a0433\u00a0408 to be exact . 
  you 're off by about 1.8 million , because you 're accidentally counting parts of ireland . 
  the optimist part of that is the word `` expert '' . 
  he 'll believe whoever he hears the most from . 
  if he actually only trusted experts , he would n't be flip-flopping so much to begin with . 
   ` why do n't you guys have a proportional voting system per state instead of winner takes all ? ', 
  the obvious answer being `` because that would be bad for the people currently in charge '' . 
  the government is absolutely awful at reforming itself . 
  annoyingly , for a lot of his followers , you 're not wrong . 
  the most absurd one i heard was when scott adams said trump trying to convince people obama is kenyan was part of his master plan to make them believe obama is american eight years later . 
  `` follow then lead '' , he called it . 
   i 'm sorry , but mainstream media should be held to a higher standard than this . 
  firstly , * all * news orgs should be held to the same standard . 
  i do n't know why you 'd imply otherwise . 
  secondly :  dishonesty does not deserve any other classification than `` fake news '' yes it should . 
  it should get the classification of `` dishonest '' . 
  and then outright lies get the classification of `` fake news '' , because they are not the same thing . 
  you ca n't just call them the same thing because they both involve misleading people . 
  that 's not what fake news means - at least , it 's not outside of conservative media . 
  for everywhere else , `` fake news '' means stuff that 's actually just made up , not stuff that 's reporting correctly but trying to be misleading about it . 
   no , as i also stated , she stayed in mogadishu for 6 months prior to this interview/report so she is basing this on her own experience . 
  i should 've clarified : she did n't try anything like that in mogadishu . 
  she did in sweden , got blowback , and went `` well since my out-of-the-spotlight life in somalia was better than this , i conclude that sweden is the worse country to be a journalist in '' . 
  again though , i 'm just presuming that . 
   somalia and mogadishu are two different countries in case you did n't know . 
  ... no they 're not . 
  mogadishu is the capital city of somalia . 
  it might , because it 's anti-anti-muslim . 
  but yeah , if it does n't involve muslims at all , nobody cares . 
  / r/europe just goes '' [ oh my god , there was a terrorist bombing today in ... ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-39666785 ) ireland ? 
  oh nevermind , that 's not worth talking about . '', 
  / r/europe , in half a year :  police found attack on dortmund never happened . 
  `` we do n't know how people heard that anything had happened at all , we never talked about it '' , a police offer said . 
  no no no . 
  [ nestl\u00e9 pays $ 524 a year for that water . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36161580 ), 
  eh ... yeah , i guess you 're right . 
  it 's not right to have such different punishments for assassination and * attempted * assassination . 
  i take back what i said . 
  as they say in japan : `` okay . '', 
   / r europe far left you 're not wrong . 
   and huge masses of unemployable people living on basic income ( `` socialize the costs '' ) that 's not what `` socialise the costs '' mean . 
  what you 're describing is people just being made redundant en masse . 
  `` privatise the gains , socialise the costs '' refers to bailing out businesses that fail without proportionately taxing the businesses that succeed . 
  perhaps i should 've added some labels : popular opinion : `` muslims are to blame ! '', 
  police : `` actually , it turns out it was just a guy trying to make it look like muslims did it . '', 
  basemyth : `` let 's talk about muslims anyway ! '', 
  make decisions based on what criminologists and statistics say ? 
   why does this keep happening with dangerous extremists ? 
  as much as people want to believe that the government always prioritises citizens over criminals and will do everything to keep the law-abiding ones safe , in actuality the government is much more fond of having a compromise and only keeping criminals locked up until a point where the chance of recidivism is sufficiently low , and just hoping they do n't do it again . 
  partly because they * really * do n't like keeping potentially now harmless people locked up ( `` better to let a thousand guilty go free '' , and whatnot ) , and partly because prisons are expensive . 
  of course , politicians do n't tell people that , because the law-abiding citizens would want nothing less than to have all felons locked up forever , felon suspects treated like felons until we can prove they 're innocent , and possibly reintroduce the death sentence if we can be sure that someone 's definitely guilty . 
  if there 's enough support for banning people from entry based purely on `` people of a religion have an extra high yet still very small chance of committing murder '' , there 'd be riots in the streets if a politician ever said they 're letting actual murderers out so often . 
  a whole life sentence for less than murder ? 
  i mean , i went into this thread expecting a lot of `` i have literally no experience in criminology and am n't basing any of my opinions on statistics , but i conclude that we 're being too soft of criminals '' , but i was n't expecting a suggestion * that * extreme . 
  are you thinking of poll hedging ? 
  the bandwagon effect applies for * actual * voting , so it more likely favours macron . 
   le pen is gon na win .
