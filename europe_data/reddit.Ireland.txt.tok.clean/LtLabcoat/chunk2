  to insist on the near-pathological character of nationalism , its roots in fear and hatred of the other , and its affinities with racism , it is useful to remind ourselves that nations inspire love , and often profoundly self-sacrificing love . 
  i would n't agree with this either . 
  i mean , let 's take * modern * ireland - it has , essentially , very little trace of nationality left . 
  or if it does , it 's a purely european one , with barely any bearing on its former self . 
  no more irish dancing , people do n't watch irish shows , you 'll only hear traditional irish music on `` old men 's radio '' or in pubs , there 's more people who resent the irish language than that support it , people do n't mind working on a sunday , and there 's very little of people blowing each other up anymore . 
  the only things that have survived are irish sports ( and not as popular as football/rugby ) , guinness , and the question `` does father ted count as irish ? '' . 
  and yet , people in ireland seem to be perfectly content . 
  they still work hard for their country , they still respect each other , there does n't seem to be any noticeable attitude difference between them and their much-more-nationalist british neighbors . 
  ... and that 's it . 
  those are his only two points about how a national identity is a good thing , the rest is about how europe is too anti-nationalist and too willing to ignore existing cultures . 
  frankly , he just does n't give a convincing argument for why nationalism is necessary at all . 
   i just think they 'll do much worse things in future yes , well , i do n't think you can treat a civilian as a militant because `` i had a hunch '' . 
  except maybe in the us . 
  is a military trial faster than a regular trial ? 
  what 's the difference ? 
  actually , it does n't matter either way - there 's simply no way you could get away with declaring refugees `` militants '' because they bully gay people . 
   deportation would be the best if we ca n't send them back . 
  do you mean `` can '' ? 
  ` deportation ' and ` sending them back ' mean the same thing . 
   lol . 
  europe does n't even know their identities ( most of them ) and we want them to be trialled ? 
  ... are you objecting to the notion that everyone is entitled to a fair trial ? 
  actually , looking into it some more , it seems that [ the european court of human rights is against keeping fingerprints ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7764069.stm ) , but [ the european court of justice is in favour of it ] ( https://edri.org/european-court-of-justice-fingerprints-in-electronic-passport-are-ok/ ) . 
  it looks like it 's * really * debatable . 
   i was fingerprinted when i got my passport or id , so it 's already the case , no ? 
  wait really ? 
  i thought just about every country was * against * keeping fingerprints of all citizens , that it was universally disliked . 
  man , that 's changed my view quite a lot . 
   so the point is to relieve countries of a responsibility and dump it on a handful few , that also happen to be in an economic pickle ? 
  i 'm strongly in favour of quotas myself . 
  but in any case , there needs to be a better solution than `` no need for background checks , just let them through . 
  they 'll * probably * register legally in some other country '' . 
   if a crime happens , we have a record . 
  that 's a poor reason , simply because that 's a reason to fingerprint everyone - migrant or citizen alike . 
   if said person aplies for assylum somewhere , we already have his file and can act accordingly , plus it saves time , thus ressources . 
  so because austria would have already done a bit of a background check , it avoids the next country from having to do the same thing . 
  that 's ... fair , i guess . 
   we also can know where they go when they get screened , instead of being a new persob each time and thus know the numbers more accurately . 
  schengen countries do n't keep track of people just passing through . 
  as far as i 'm aware , anyway . 
   my argument is that when the southern states do it it 's made a huge deal but wheb it 's austria or germany not so much . 
  it 's the application of double standards that gets me . 
  but the point is that there * is * supposed to be a double standard . 
  the whole point of the schengen area is that only certain countries have to care about their borders ( ones bordering the sea or a non-eu country ) and the rest do n't , and austria and germany are two of the countries that do n't . 
  they , essentially , do n't have borders at all . 
   as for your second paragraph i do n't quite get it . 
  i 'm asking what 's the point on austria saving fingerprints in the first place ? 
  well , yeah . 
  they 're the three big border states of the schengen area . 
  they 're the ones who should be managing entrants as they arrive , and trying to stop people who do n't have passports or such . 
  what 's austria supposed to do - ask what country the immigrant comes from , then let them in if they say `` anywhere in europe '' because they do n't need id ? 
  i mean , even aside from the massive privacy concern of saving every tourist 's fingerprint ( it 's illegal for a reason ) , what 's the point of doing so to begin with ? 
  how would having their fingerprint going to help with anything beyond the usual `` if they commit a crime it 'd be nice to know '' stuff that would apply to all civilians too ? 
   no government can be this incompetent . 
  you do know that * your * country also made it illegal to keep fingerprints simply on the basis that they 're immigrants , right ? 
  title : `` austria does n't save migrant fingerprints ! '', 
  text : `` because it 's illegal unless they 're asylum seekers , in which case it does . '', 
  * quality article !, 
  no fear-mongering here !, 
  * the only people who would legitimately object to this are the people who do n't really care about this `` privacy '' stuff and think it 's perfectly fine for the police to have fingerprints on literally every tourist , and last i checked those people are in the distinct minority . 
  but hey , make it look like it 's about refugees and suddenly it 's controversial news !, 
  easy ad-clicks !, 
  promotions for everyone !, 
  * wo n't someone think of the illegal immigrants !, 
  because they 're legal immigrants , of course . 
  or more accurately , they * could * be illegal immigrants , but nobody 's checking . 
  keep in mind that eu countries are quite serious when they say they do n't have real borders . 
  they do n't check for this stuff any more than , say , london does for people entering its county . 
  you make it sound like `` we 'll build a great wall of america , and make mexico pay for it '' is n't a perfectly rational policy . 
  wait , what does `` apparently '' mean in this context ? 
  is it a `` this is the specific tweet that police and prosecutors have publicly announced to using '' , or is it a `` there 's a tweet here that does n't sound good , this is probably it '' ? 
  it 's basically europe 's way of saying `` well sure , we 'd like you to stay if we had a choice , but you 're not so important that we 'll stick our necks out for you '' . 
   the overly politically correct ( but highly inaccurate ) practice of labeling anyone who has at any point considered applying for refugee status a `` refugee '' . 
  that 's not `` politically correct '' , that 's just bad reporting . 
  how would it even * be * pc to say `` refugees committed the crimes '' rather than `` asylum seekers committed the crimes '' ? 
  surely the one that insults refugees would be considerably worse . 
   so you assume enough jobs will be there for refugees in european host countries ( many of which already with high unemployment rates ) yet think there are too few in turkey . 
  well , yes . 
  europe - simply by virtue of being much much larger and having a generally more skilled native population - has much more low-pay-low-skill jobs available . 
  of course , that 's not to say that europe definitely has enough jobs and turkey does n't , just that europe will be able to provide more jobs than turkey will . 
   overall the refugees will contribute nothing haha what ? 
  it 's like you took the `` they 're all doctors and scientists '' thing and flipped it completely in the opposite way . 
  they wo n't all be employed , but there 'll certainly be quite a lot of them not content to just life off of welfare . 
  they 're like us in that regard , there 's nothing in the quran that says `` thou shalt never work if thy can afford not doing so '' . 
   or that they will only increase taxes by .5 % look , the actual figure may vary , but if you 're going to say that that 's * completely * wrong than you need to provide some actual sources that indicate otherwise . 
  none of this `` i know what refugees are like , they 're all the same '' nonsense . 
   does this mean that in turkey the refugees are actually giving back and erdogan should have an incentive to continue to keep them in turkey ? 
  : d unless the refugee businessmen manage to make an industry out of nothing , there 's not likely going to be enough jobs available for the amount * turkey * is taking in . 
  er ... just to make sure , are you basing that on actual stats/studies or are you just guessing ? 
  i feel like you 're replying to the wrong person , because the one that you are replying to is basically agreeing with you about how ridiculous this trend is . 
   because we have to spend an order of magnitude more money per head than turkey . 
  that 's not actually true . 
  [ i did the calculations in a previous post based on sweden 's figures ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/43dgci/turkey_wants_more_money_from_eu_for_refugee_aid/czhnl1o ) , and it seems that every 1 million refugees in europe effectively increases taxes by 0.5 % , because of how much they give back too . 
  assuming sweden is an average country , that is . 
  it 's simply cheaper to house refugees in europe than to try pay another country to take care of them . 
  edit : wait , that 's if you think europe * should * be paying turkey for them . 
  if you do n't , then it 's free for europe and turkey gets screwed . 
  that 's a bit of a different issue . 
   teritary education gender gap ( bigger gap means more points ) ah yes . 
  because as we all know , one of the most important things about where to live as a woman is picking someplace with the lowest ratio of men : women .
