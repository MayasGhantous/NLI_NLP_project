  with men and their sexy wiles constantly distracting them , women are free to spend more of their time studying !, 
  i sure am glad that * this * is considered just as important as the ratio of male : female senior managers in a `` glass ceiling index '' . 
   but letting masses of people of any kind move into your country without any regulation is stupid . 
  i dunno , it 's been working out pretty well for ireland so far . 
  / r/europe , / r/worldnews and / r/news all have the same problem : there 's a * lot * of people only looking to post in refugee topics . 
  when you find a discussion in a thread not related to refugees at all , it tends to be much more balanced . 
  ` tends ' , because it 's usually not this one-sided-in-the-other-direction . 
  at least , that 's what it was like in the other two subs , last i checked . 
  i do n't go there anymore . 
  where , exactly , do you think all the pharmaceutical companies and such are coming from ? 
  up until about 30 years ago , ireland was practically a second world country - they certainly did n't come from here . 
  most of them are american-based , multi-continental , and bring in experts from all around the world . 
  of course there 's a lot of irish people involved running them now , but the foundations for these companies are distinctly foreign . 
  just like with any other science-based industry . 
   yes because they will come in droves once they realize we have built wall in here , naturally they will build their atlantic capital and usher mankind into new age , instead of staying home knowing they 're not getting here , as what happened in australia . 
  wait , * that 's * your logic ? 
  that they 'll be intimidated by ... a big wall ? 
  hell no , the asylum seekers already often do n't even bother trying to dock because at least one guy on board thinks it 's a better idea to just sink their ship and let the coast guard pick them up . 
  like , i did n't think your idea was to build a * literal * wall , and hope that that was enough to make asylum seekers change their mind . 
  that 'd do about as much as trying to close the american/mexico border by putting up some angry signs . 
   they can live in the sea if they want , as long they do n't have access to mainland . 
  and here we have cerdict showing us that murderous extremism is n't exclusive to the middle east . 
  but in that situation , it 's still not a million people . 
  there 's - let 's aim high and say a few thousand - people they watch out for , and if they find one then they can do a quick background check . 
  with refugees , you have to multiply that by up to a thousandfold , and there 's no way to validate if the machine got it wrong . 
  the new iphone is most certainly * not * capable of distinguishing over a million fingerprints . 
  it 's only good enough to say that the chances that someone else who gets their hands on the phone will have a similar enough fingerprint is very slim . 
  but there wo n't even be a hundred people using the phone , let alone a million . 
   was i rude ? 
  it was n't that you were rude , it 's that you deliberately avoided the question !, 
   https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/44lz41/as_of_15_january_2016_just_over_55_per_cent_of/czr9k1j?context=3  here you go . 
  this ... 
  this pdf clearly says that 54 % of under 16s were male . 
  this conversation has reached entirely new levels of stupidity . 
   judging from the shown families god ** damnit !, 
  ** this entire discussion would 've been completely unnecessary if , when i asked `` are you basing this on images you saw in a newspaper '' , you had just said `` yes '' , rather than making a snarky comment about how you ca n't trust images of refugees in the media * before trusting images of refugees in the media !, 
  *  this assumption is backed by actual stats fro migration from the middle east and africa from the years 2014 and 2013 . 
  the link to the pdf file you can find somewhere here in the thread . 
  i had a look , and i could n't find anything of the sort . 
  mind providing me a link ? 
   this is no statistic , it is an assumption . 
  what 's your problem ? 
  my problem is that you 're not explaining why you 're assuming that !, 
  you just came into a topic and said `` yeah , the children are probably 9/10ths male '' and left it at that , and i 'm asking * what the hell are you on about ?!, 
  okay then , so what * are * you basing this `` all the families seem to consist of several boys and one girl at best '' comment on ? 
    we had enough of this media bullshit already . 
   that was my original point hold on , you 're trying to convince us that you linking to media nonsense unironically was actually to convey how we should n't trust the media ? 
  okay , you seem * very * confused about what 's going on here , so let me explain : this guy came to sweden in 2003 . 
  he was 6 at the time . 
  5 years ago , he had this picture taken . 
  now he 's 19 . 
  and there 's no reason to think that any part of that is wrong , despite how `` late 20 's '' he looks to you . 
   now that they show more families in the media that is a worrying trend i have seen . 
   all the families seem to consist of several boys and one girl at best . 
  wait wait , are you basing your stats on `` pictures i saw in my newspaper '' ? 
  like , not graphs or anything , but just pictures of some families ? 
  i feel like you were trying to make a point , but i ca n't tell what it was . 
  alright , think of it like this : imagine all the people that try to win the lottery ... 
  how do you know that these migrants are the same ones with the expensive phones and internet plans ? 
   take finger prints from every single one , check them against a database . 
  hold on , how good is modern fingerprint-reading technology at differentiating literally over a million fingerprints ? 
  i did n't think we had any program approaching anywhere near that yet . 
  outside of tv , i mean . 
  i do n't see what the problem is with that question . 
   that 's what the eu reforms were trying to do and they had to be argued down to giving overseas benefits based on cost of living in those countries . 
  wait really ? 
  do you have a source on that ? 
   child benefits are given to families in the uk as well , we ca n't scrap it because other people have learnt how to loophole the issue just ... cut the loophole . 
  it 's not hard . 
   but it is fair to seek a way to reduce it . 
  well here 's an easy way to reduce it : stop giving completely estranged parents child support altogether . 
  a parent that literally is n't around for their kids * at all * should n't be getting child benefits . 
  saying we should only cut it if the parent is n't british is ridiculous !, 
  and in any case , cameron is suggesting removing far more in-work benefits than just this specific kind of child support scenario . 
  it 's really not what the topic is about . 
  the financial times [ seems to imply cameron cut a deal with the polish government ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/25d9bc50-cbe6-11e5-be0b-b7ece4e953a0.html#axzz3zoio7igm ) :  david cameron has won over the most important critic of his plan to curb eu migrant benefits , persuading poland with pledges of military support , political blandishments and concessions on treaty change . 
  which is likely , since poland had the exact * opposite * opinion [ about a week ago ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-poland-migrants-idukkcn0v7190 ) . 
  so ... what , are you talking about a divorce situation ? 
  in that case , why does britain gives child benefits to people that do n't have custody of their own children ? 
  welfare abuse ? 
  they call in-work benefits * welfare abuse ?!, 
  * i 'm sorry , but when did tax credits for poorer employees count as welfare abuse ? 
  i 'd understand if it was something that was actually welfare-related , like cutting nhs , but what cameron is proposing is literally making foreigners pay more tax !, 
  geez , i know the telegraph shills as bad as fox news when it comes to nationalist topics , but that 's obscene !, 
  also , there 's no way it 'll pass in the eu . 
  hungary will allow it , but only because hungary wants to do the same thing . 
  pretty much every other country is staunchly against it . 
   if there was at least one progressive muslim country i would feel better what 's wrong with turkey ? 
   and then you have to import your labor and import your taxes and import your children ? 
   what a road to go down . 
  oh my god , you have * no * idea what ireland is like . 
  let me break it down for you : every year , [ for every person born in ireland , three people emigrate out and four people immigrate in ] ( http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/pme/populationandmigrationestimatesapril2014/ ) . 
  we have three times the immigration rate that the uk does , and four times that of the us . 
  in fact , if the us took in the same rate of immigrants that we do , they 'd be taking in 4.2 million a year !, 
  moreso , ireland has no visa requirements with 85 countries of the world . 
  and i do n't mean a travel visa , i mean that if someone from one of those 85 countries wanted to live here permanently , all they need is a passport !, 
  we effectively have an open border with mexico !, 
  and how does this affect the industry ? 
  well , [ here 's what a normal country 's exports look like ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/2012_united_kingdom_products_export_treemap.png ) . 
  now [ here 's ireland 's .
