  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/ireland_export_treemap.jpg ) notice how a * vast * majority of our exports are chemistry and computer science based ? 
  there 's absolutely no way we 'd have been able to specialise like that if we were discouraging migration . 
  and that 's not even counting software , so no `` tax haven '' excuses here !, 
  so no , ireland did n't succeed because of all these irish people giving irish births and keeping out non-irish like you `` foreigners are scary '' people do . 
  ireland basically did the exact opposite , and became the most anti-nationalist country in the entire developed world !, 
  i dunno , the flipside of that is that there 's a lot less money to spend on rolling out reforms too . 
  and ireland . 
  last time i looked , our country has 77 % support for staying in the eu ( red c poll ) . 
  and 95 % support with farmers , so if there was ever a national debate there 's no way we 'd leave . 
   whilst the only tangible benefit we get told about is that the economy will be stronger in the eu eh ? 
  the biggest drawback from leaving the eu is that it 'll be significantly harder for the british to get jobs in eu countries ( ireland excluded ) and the disincentive that puts on companies to set up base in england . 
  opinion pieces talk about the economy the most because it 's the most debatable and least obvious major drawback . 
  can someone summarise this for those of us that do n't speak google english ? 
  actually , i also wonder how many people will think `` it 's not a bad thing if white people are n't a majority '' to mean `` i think less white people is a good thing '' , rather than that i 'm just not racist . 
  probably less , since i just pointed it out . 
   i think left-wing political thought will succeed in destroying any form of national identities  related to this i also believe whites will only make up around 50 % ( or less ) of the population in most countries  europe will be economically poorer relative to the rest of the world . 
  i wonder how many people here actually think these are bad things ... 
   cars with guns mounted on them ? 
  that 's hardly much of a prediction . 
  car-mounted guns were already a thing back then , they just were n't common . 
   we had people play golf on the moon , not croquet . 
  they 're ... not on the moon . 
  well , when your population drops in half from something that could 've been easily prevented , it 's a pretty big deal . 
  for those wondering how much refugees give back : [ in 2007 , sweden ( with it 's 1/20 guys being a refugee ) got 50b kronor from taxes on refugees , and spent 80b kronor on supporting the refugees ] ( http://www.voxeu.org/article/fiscal-cost-refugees-europe ) . 
  if we assume it works the same way in germany , that means it 's more like spending $ 20 billion . 
  in other words , we 're looking at it costing the average german $ 125 a year extra tax to house refugees . 
  ( keep in mind that that 's the * average * - most of it will , as always , be put on the rich . ), 
  maths !, 
  ( edit : oh , and sweden 2007 was just the best source i could find tracking refugee income/expenditure . 
  i 'm not cherry-picking . ), 
   you can only use the money once . 
  that is literally the opposite of how money works . 
  ... well actually no , having an external migrant camp would mean you could only use the money once . 
  then it goes into someone else 's country . 
  half because there 's hardly any refugees , half because everyone grew up hearing about the famine . 
   women are fighting in syria oh boy , it 's time for another game of * `` what is this guy talking about ? 
  * today , your choices are : a : a typo . 
  b : they think that the `` thousands of married immigrants who left their family behind '' reports refer to abandoning them in syria , rather than safe places like lebanon or turkey . 
  c : they 're really against the concept of allowing women to serve in the military . 
  place your bets now !, 
  ( $ 10 says that someone 's reading this is going to think `` wait , syria allows women to fight in the military ? '' ), 
  they 're extremist nationalists . 
  since anything extremist is considered `` far '' and anything nationalist is considered `` right '' that makes them far-right . 
  edit : alright , alright , just because you 're far-right on one issue does n't make you far-right . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** i break down , as best i can and using actual statistics , why refugees are n't actually much of a problem . 
   also , might i ask why you do n't think europe is struggling ? 
  because considering how much this situation has blown up i think we are at least being inconvenienced by this whole situation . 
  inconvenienced ? 
  sure . 
  but not by much . 
  certainly not struggling !, 
  i mean , let 's break this down into two categories : monetary cost and crime rate . 
  we can calculate the rough monetary cost using previous figures . 
  [ sweden 2007 , for example , because they were tracking these figures at the time ] ( http://www.voxeu.org/article/fiscal-cost-refugees-europe ) . 
  the country is ( was ? ), 
  made up of 5 % refugees , who - factoring in both taxes they make and social expenses for them - cost the state 32.5 billion kronor . 
  compared to the 1473 billion kronor that they make from taxes , you could think of it as that the swedes had to pay 2.2 % more tax than before , for 5 % of their population being refuges ( keep in mind that that 's 2.2 % of what tax they 're currently paying , not 2.2 % of their paycheck ) . 
  if we assume that sweden is an average country , and extrapolate that to the rest of europe , and even assume that no asylum seekers were deported , that means 2015 refugees make up 1.2 % of the population of europe , and cost a total of ... a 0.5 % increase to taxes . 
  a 0.5 % increase is not very much . 
  for comparison , the uk military costs four times that . 
  now let 's talk about crime : as noted by the german police , refugees are n't actually more criminal than regular citizens [ ( 1 ) ] ( http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/fluechtlingskrise-soko-asyl-fluechtlinge-sind-nicht-krimineller-als-deutsche_id_5245477.html ) [ ( 2 ) ] ( http://www.thelocal.de/20151113/police-refugees-commit-less-crimes-than-germans ) . 
  and there 's no statistics saying the opposite , so unless you 're willing to accuse the government of conspiracy , there 's no reason to doubt it . 
  with that out of the way , let 's talk about the two big incidents : the paris shootings and the cologne sexual assaults . 
  we do n't know how many people involved in the shootings/bombings arrived as refugees , but let 's assume all nine criminals were . 
  and let 's also assume that smugglers do n't exist and they would have had no way in except as refugees . 
  and for more assumptions , let 's ignore murders outside of that incident ( i sure have n't heard much about refugees murdering non-refugees , so it should be relatively low - like murder usually is ) , and also assume that refugees came at a constant rate through the year . 
  that 's a lot of assumptions , but they should * inflate * the figure rather than deflate it . 
  in total , we 're looking at around an average of 26 murders per year per 100,000 asylum seekers . 
  [ that makes the average asylum seeker as inclined to murder as the average new yorker ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_united_states_cities_by_crime_rate_%282014%29 ) . 
  that 's ... more than we 'd like , but i 'd hardly say that * new york * is struggling with it 's own population . 
  and again , that 's only if we assume that * all * the killers would 've been foiled without the refugee crisis . 
  and finally , we have cologne . 
  this one 's just ... bizarre . 
  there was a whole load of sexual assaults yet next-to-no rape . 
  it was localised to one city , and on one day . 
  and it 's predominately pre-crisis refugees/migrants , yet it only happened this year . 
  in short , there 's no proper explanation for why it happened . 
  but similarly , there 's no reason to think this is a common occurrence . 
  ... besides , there 's no way you know what the actual rate of sexual assault * is * for a new years celebration , so we do n't even know how `` handsy '' they are compared to regular citizens . 
  so in conclusion : no , i do n't think europe is struggling at all . 
  it could certainly do * without * refugees , but only in the same way that it could do without the homeless or the disabled - which is to say , they should still be helped . 
  edit : and before anyone asks , i have no opinion myself on whether it 's better to have refugees in europe or move/keep them in camps in other countries . 
  it really comes down to costs - it costs more to have them in other countries ( see previous calculation re : 0.5 % of current taxes to house 1m refugees - you wo n't get nearly that low with any other country ) , but it 's going to have social costs to keep them here . 
  it depends on which you consider more valuable . 
  edit 2 : and i swear to god , i better not get comments about how the refugees will turn the country into a culturally backwards hellhole because they ca n't tell the difference between syria and saudi arabia , i 'm going to freak . 
  for reference , syria is the one with the female vice-president and where everyone seems to love top gear . 
  i 'm going to leave aside that europe is `` struggling already '' , since although i disagree it 's a least debatable . 
  however :  also , why should n't turkey keep them , they are one of the closest countries after all , they 're safe , they 're a muslim majority country and they are capable of housing them turkey takes in more refugees than any other country . 
  if you think europe is struggling from taking in 7 % of the refugees , it 's nothing compared to what turkey 's going through . 
  they 've got no interest in taking in refugees for free when both the citizens and the refugees want them to go to europe instead . 
  hence why europe has to offer them aid . 
   yet even though we are giving turkey lots of funds they are still letting many refugees through . 
  you mean we * will * give turkey lots of funds if they stop doing that . 
  we have n't actually given them anything yet . 
  and turkey is basically going `` we 've decided that we wo n't do it for 3 billion '' . 
  / r/europe 's thoughts on trump announcing that he wants to cut off aid to refugees and refuse entry to arab migrants : * what ?!, 
  is america so poor that they ca n't help out the rest of the world ? 
  even the statue of liberty explicitly says america is a country open for everyone !, 
  they should do their part too !, 
  this is an outrage !,
