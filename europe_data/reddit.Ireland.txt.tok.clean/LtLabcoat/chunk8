  here , it goes for the delicate approach of choosing specific wording to make it * look * like it 's a growing problem , but without actually saying it 's a growing problem . 
  let us observe . 
   as it grapples with anti-semitic violence increasingly inspired by the islamic state group . 
  this is a good approach to trick some of the more clumsy readers . 
  by putting `` increasingly '' next to `` anti-semitic '' , it conveys a feeling that the crimes are actually increasing , but where it 's actually the much more verifiable fact of that more attacks are in the name of isis - obvious , considering how insignificant the group was before . 
   and a nation shaken by a violent year . 
  by referring to it as a `` violent year '' implies that this year was particularly violent , but without having to explicitly say so . 
  a quality choice of wording . 
   that is a big factor that drove nearly 8,000 french jews to emigrate last year . 
  here , a clever use of facts that the site * does * have has been reused to suit a new purpose . 
  rather than `` 8,000 people prefer living in israel than france '' , it 's `` 8,000 people left france , possibly to escape anti-semitism '' . 
  very clever . 
  and that is how the new york times makes this look like it 's a new debate on a new crisis , rather than the same `` anti-semitism on the rise '' story that 's been happening [ literally ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=france+anti+semitic+attacks+rise&amp;biw=1623&amp;bih=878&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3a1%2ccd_min%3a01%2f01%2f2014%2ccd_max%3a31%2f12%2f2014&amp;tbm= ) .

  i 'm pretty sure the people using the phrase ` economic migrants ' are complaining about the migrants pretending to be refugees of another country , not that they personally find the very concept of moving from greece to germany shocking to them . 
  well , except maybe for the people who 're under the impression that it 's illegal for asylum seekers to try walk to a different country before registering . 
  but they 're the exception . 
  ... i hope . 
  the problem is n't so much the gulf states - countries like iraq and the uae are helping out a good deal - the problem is specifically israel and saudi arabia and their `` we do n't want to help the syrians '' policies . 
  yup . 
  unlike mainland europe , our islands still require passports to get in or out . 
  it works pretty well for us so i do n't see the schengen going down as anything more than `` pretty unfortunate '' . 
   member states have to register migrants and ca n't let illegals roam around crossing european borders at will . 
  actually , on that topic , i 've read the dublin regulation and i honestly could n't find the part saying that they * have * to register migrants . 
  did i miss something , or does it actually not say that ? 
   the independent and the help refugees fb page do n't seem to mention that ... 
  i do n't get it . 
  the sunday express reports that refugees are turning down heat and electricity to live in tents because they do n't like the look of the houses , and you think it 's the * other * news sources that are n't reporting honestly ? 
  i agree . 
  which is why it 's * really * concerning me that france is n't either processing or arresting them . 
  the government should be either offering them a position in refuge or sending them back to where they came from , not going `` you . 
  move . '', 
  and nothing else . 
  unless they actually * are * processed refugees , in which case something 's gone very wrong here . 
  edit : ah , found out what 's actually happening . 
  the people are indeed processed , as far as i can tell . 
  there 's a refugee centre right next door , but a lot of people are - for one reason or another - afraid of moving . 
  the french government is giving the refugees three days to pressure them into going , and the help refugees group is saying that that 's not enough time . 
  inevitably , the french government are going to move it back by about a week , but then actually start bulldozing . 
  if i 'm right about all this , then that 's ... a lot less exciting . 
   if they had time to count them , they had time to catch and deport them . 
  what do think they 're doing ? 
  how do you think they figured out their demographics like this ? 
  do you think they 're just letting suspects go scott-free , as if the police are only finding people for the fun of it and do n't want to actually charge anyone ? 
  * ohhhhh . 
  * sorry , i thought you were complaining about the uk paying favouritism to non-eu countries closer to them . 
  now i see that you 're complaining about the eu itself and how it operates as a single country . 
   immigration should be based on how valuable those migrants are to the country in question , and a country should take in as many or as few immigrants as it wants . 
  this is where you and the eu disagree . 
  the eu believes that being able to choose your country and government * should n't * be some sort of survival of the fittest . 
  that we 're all in this together . 
  that , as long as the cultures are n't too different , a government should n't be able to go `` okay , we 'll only take in the competent people and leave out the rest '' . 
  you talked about having a `` totally unearned birth-right '' , but actually it 's the opposite - it 's giving people that normally * would * be locked out the same rights as someone who happened to be born in the country . 
  but most importantly , canada could have that sort of deal too . 
  the eu might be a bit hard to have an agreement with , but they definitely could with the us . 
  but your government does n't want that kind of deal , so guys like you get locked out . 
  you could petition your mp * right now * to change that , if you wanted . 
  ... but i 'm guessing you wo n't , because you do n't agree with the eu at all on this , so you 'll continue to be stuck in canada and complain about how people keep making immigration treaties without you . 
  right , yes . 
  i 'm sure the uk is * totally * turning away competent english speaking employable people in favour of turkish and russians for ... no reason . 
  it 's * definitely not * that the uk does n't take in much non-eu non-refugee immigrants at all and you 're trying to blame someone . 
  i 'm being sarcastic , if you could n't tell . 
  the uk does n't just take in random people , whoever told you that is lying . 
  if this sub is like / r/news and / r/worldnews ( i do n't post here enough to know ) , then it could be the same `` problem '' - a large number of people that browse the sub , but are only interested in discussing certain things , such as the refugee crisis . 
  you can tell by if a refugee discussion pops up in a non-refugee topic and the votes are going in a very different way to the front-page refugee threads . 
  i say `` problem '' because it 's not * really * a problem . 
  the votecounts get skewed compared to how normal subscribers would vote , but that 's about it . 
  more discussion is n't a bad thing . 
   eu has not been able to address the issue , but has probaly made it worse by insisting on austerity and sticking to a monetary policy that makes an economic recovery slow and almost impossible in some of the member states . 
  only if countries made good use of borrowing money . 
  if they did n't , and their planned investments fell though , it would be far worse for the youths as they 'd be paying extra taxes for ... basically their entire lives . 
  well `` disgusting '' aside , yes , it 's not evading because it 's legal . 
  it 's literally just moving your company to where there 's less tax . 
  as pointed out elsewhere , the gnp - which excludes such multinational tax avoidance - still grew by 18 % . 
  it 's pretty much guaranteed at this point that , if the topic is n't controversial , it 'll be a reasonably good video with a strong argument basically just highlighting that it 's an issue that needs to be solved . 
  but if it * is * a controversial topic , it 'll just turn into the same nonsense you find on other low-budget talk shows as he completely fails to come up with a new argument , and just resorts to mocking people who do n't share his opinion . 
   or enforce water charges let 's not go dictatorship levels of strong here . 
   or rein in banks they do n't have control over when banks lie though , no matter how strong the government could be . 
   or stop gang feuds okay , two things then . 
  although they 're still considerably more in control than other countries . 
   or the sort out the guards err ... what 's wrong with the guards ? 
   or prevent a cross border insurgency a few decades ago . 
  so if ireland has a weak government , and britain has a weak government , then what 's an example of a * strong * government ? 
   remember thanks to stv , the government will only try to do something if most people agreed with it as of 5 years ago in any case . 
  wait , you 're complaining about * democracy itself * now ? 
  i was joking when i said we should n't go dictatorship levels !, 
   `` relatively rich '' and `` relatively poor '' are ... relative . 
  yes , they are . 
  so are inequality and poverty . 
   ireland has one of the worst child poverty rates in europe . 
  also not true . 
  we 're about in the middle . 
  on par with england , specifically . 
   the reality distortion field in ireland is unparalleled . 
  people believe what they are told rather than what they can see in front of their faces . 
  we 're shown these kinds of statistics and they work to convince people that ireland has a world class economy . 
  translation : `` i come from a poorer part of the country . 
  statistics are saying that the overall country is fairly rich , but when i look out my window all i see is poor .
