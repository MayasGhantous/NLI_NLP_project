and the irish taxpayers are paying it back ... * looks towards greece *, 
  we do n't talk like leprechauns and actually speak normal english , older generations from kerry can be incomprehensible though . 
  while alcohol is a big enough part of the social scene here , it is not anymore prevalent than in eastern europe and we are not the raging alcoholics portrayed by the stereotype . 
  potatoes are the fucking best though , i 'm sure latvia can confirm . 
   but solemn declarations to `` do the right thing '' do not always lead to sound policy . 
  i 'm sure german and swedish politicians will realise this eventually . 
  well , ireland is just under 1/3rd the area of the uk but since we only have 1/14th the population we will always have large agricultural exports and room for people to live . 
  we also do a * lot * of pharmaceutical production and a large amount of computer processor production so as long as people still need food , medicine and computers our economy should be fine . 
  it 's a nice place to live if you do n't want more than 5 days of summer per year . 
  would that be a proxy war or an actual war with russia ? 
  since actual russian troops are apparently backing assad 's government on the ground i guess the distinction is based on where the bombs land ... 
  please no . 
   though it 's not like europe did n't get that option with previous generations of immigrants europe has never and will never truly have that option . 
  the eu 's eastern land border alone is about 8,000 kilometers and our southern maritime border is over 34,000 kilometers . 
  it is impossible to patrol it all and the very nature of shengen means that internal border checks are n't required so once they get in it is very hard to find them as they disappear into the black job market . 
  if you do find them then they claim asylum which takes an eternity to process and deny by which point they may have disappeared again and gotten a new identity . 
   i 'm just saying europe 's failures do n't mean multiculturalism as an idea is a failure . 
  multiculturalism may be working better in canada as a result of the possibility to control essentially all immigration but it still has enclaves of people who have n't integrated and its government still considers [ islamic radicalization & terrorism to be the biggest threat to canadian security . 
  ] ( http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=09fe30f3-84ad-458e-b8e7-8add2a9fc8c7 ) even in the goldilocks situation canada finds itself in , there are still huge flaws . 
  they get to vet & choose their immigrants , that fact kind of changes things . 
  if only we europeans could adopt the `` vast ocean to the left & right , superpower below and arctic wasteland above '' model ... 
  the dust literally has n't even settled yet and he is already making himself out to be the victim , it would be like if an irish person in 1980 's britain said the same thing hours after an ira bombing killed 40 people and injured hundreds . 
  its pathetic frankly . 
   except of course that the latter is n't possible given the state of ireland at the moment and the notion of even moderate nationalists or unionists suddenly deciding that republicanism is a better approach , on the back of a change that many , many unionists and nationalists support seems incredibly unlikely ... 
  still unlikely yes , but definitely more likely should britain leave the eu . 
  less subsidies and an uncertain future in regards to things like trade and foreign investment , it can hardly make it less likely . 
  ireland has the fastest economic growth rate in the eu at the moment and while an economy capable of supporting the north in its current state is a well ways off at least the growth is still there and we 're moving in the right direction . 
   right , so if everything changed then maybe at some point , but given how unlikely it is , i think we can leave it in the realm of fantasy ... 
  pretty much yeah , it would make more sense to look at the situation in a year or two should britain even vote to leave . 
   do you seriously think some bulk of unionists are suddenly going to shift their position toward reunification because the uk has left the eu no , but moderate nationalists/unionists who are less concerned with `` being british '' or the crown and more concerned with economic issues and social services could have their opinion changed if the current `` deal '' with britain becomes worse due to the brexit and a better deal is possible through unification . 
  it would n't happen in the current economic situation but the eu could potentially offer major financial incentives towards it . 
  its impossible to say right now , anything could happen should britain leave the eu . 
   there is n't a vast amount of support for reunification in ni . . 
  there is n't an overwhelming amount but there is n't an insignificant amount either and regardless of the extent , a british exit of the eu and the possible subsequent exit of scotland from the uk would alter the quantity of support in some way or another . 
  i just think people should know his opinion of ireland and the irish if he feels the need to comment on related topics here . 
   a tactic they often employ to silence critics . 
  i do n't endorse brigading ( if that was even happening , irish people are subbed to / r/europe too !, 
  shocking i know ! ), 
  but i hardly blame people downvoting someone who essentially does n't recognise their countries ' right to exist . 
  also , you are n't being critical , you 're whining and belittling a european nation on the internet . 
   care to tell us how your pseudo statelet would exist otherwise we would have defaulted , an option available to any sovereign nation . 
   or are you just going to accuse everyone you do n't agree with of being a `` troll !, 
  are you just going to accuse a european nation of being a rogue state full of stupid people because `` hurr durr the empire ! '' . 
  yeah , you 're either an obvious troll or blinded by debilitating nationalism and bigotry . 
  ah , / u/citee _ londinius , the notorious anti-irish troll/bigot .

  go back to posting on / r/shitredditsays and / r/subredditdrama please , you 're not contributing anything of value here . 
   now matter how small or poor a country is , everyone has some of these right ? 
  nope , not even the regular defense forces have made an ad in decades . 
  [ here 's a regular army one from the 80 's that inspires a life of fun and adventure ... ] ( https://youtu.be/g26xg5wtcj0?t=49 ), 
  the fuckers want to be classed as an `` oppressed minority '' over here . 
  do you realize that europe ca n't support everyone on the planet that 's `` fleeing from persecution '' ? 
  nobody lives in leitrim because it 's a made up place . 
  not just iraq , lets dissolve every country that ranks lower on [ the quality of life index ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/where-to-be-born-index-2013.jpg ) . 
  if they all come here then all their problems will be solved and europe will give each of them a unicorn and a big house !, 
  empathy is developed but it is developed naturally . 
  because politically correctness suddenly becomes a weird fucked up math game filled with severe conflicts of interest when the perpetrator or victim is n't a white male . 
  they have no idea what the fuck to do because they are faced with the dilemma of [ white ** female ** ] * vs * [ ** non-white ** & ** muslim ** ] . 
  welp , it 's 2 v 1 to the muslim , time to throw the woman under the bus because they calculated that she ranks lower on the oppression index . 
   destabilization of the middle east they made it worse but your wording is implying it was stable before their intervention and it most definitely was n't . 
   libya is n't the middle east many refugees are from libya and other north african countries so to blame the migrant crisis on the united states ' actions in the me is ridiculous . 
  this crisis was bound to happen in the connected world we live in where less well off people in places like africa can see what life is like in europe and are told how easy it is to exploit the system to gain access . 
  5 years ago i would have said sweden , funny how fast things can change right ? 
  now i have no idea , i 'm having difficulty thinking of a country i 'd like to live in more or even as much as ireland . 
  it is n't crowded , crime is low , people are mostly nice , the government are n't * complete * twats when it comes down to it , mild climate , large & growing technology & pharmaceutical sector with consistent international investment . 
  since its a hypothetical i guess i 'd go with switzerland for stability and high standard of living even though its one of the toughest countries for expats and practically impossible to get citizenship in . 
  well , an independent & unified irish state had n't existed before then . 
  if you want to count a war as one group of people engaged in hostilities with another then our main sparring partner would have to be england or the british empire . 
  the [ ghaeltacht areas in ireland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rdplqax.png ) are areas where irish is officially recognized as the predominant vernacular language . 
  everywhere else is predominantly english speaking so this map is completely inaccurate in portraying half the country as irish speaking . 
  well if any nation can do it its germany . 
  i 'm guessing state provided chastity belts and escorts are what comes next ? 
  this is beyond insanity , how can you brainstorm this idea and not come to the conclusion that your country ~ ~ is going ~ ~ has gone to shit ? 
  right ? 
  i mean why did n't we think of this before ?!, 
  europe is rich and africa is poor so if we just move all the africans to europe then they can be rich too !, 
  genius !, 
  i 'm sure a few million homeless african men will result in a big drop in crime rate across europe and greatly improve our tourism appeal . 
   which took no effort . 
  what ? 
  1815 worst year of life , anglos go home !, 
  we were the only one of their colonies in europe , literally right beside them . 
  ni is the last true vestige of the british empire , we have the oldest and longest colonial history with them . 
  by the existence of northern ireland , we are the only colony to not achieve complete independence and an actual war and terror campaign was still taking place on u.k soil just over 20 years ago as a result of that . 
  we are a special case , to argue otherwise is ridiculous . 
   yeah but you 're going to remember the bad more than the good comments . 
  there is no bad or good , just factual statements . 
  his actions in ireland and other major events in ireland caused by britain such as the famine are not taught about . 
  it 's not part of the syllabus , that 's just a fact . 
   you have a stretch calling standard warfare genocide , the 30 years war killed 50 % of germans not a genocide . 
  it was n't `` standard warfare '' , by his own admission cromwell had a pathological hatred of the irish and irish catholics in particular who he considered to be dangerous savages . 
  i do n't know why you 're bringing up the 30 years war , the percentage of a population killed does n't determine if something is a genocide or not , motive and intent does . 
  cromwell wanted the entire east , north and south of ireland free of catholics and he tried to do this ethnic cleansing through both genocide and land seizure . 
   on the flip side why should the english cover more about cromwell than any other historical english figure . 
  they do n't cover his actions in ireland at all . 
  we are right next door , we are their closest neighbor and the only nation to share a land border with them . 
  100 years ago they ruled us , there are some people alive in britain now that were alive when the whole of ireland was under british rule . 
  this is their history as well and when teaching about one of their historical figures they just ignore that he killed up to half of the irish population through genocide . 
   this may surprise you but in the same way as you teachers did n't have time to cover everything leading up to the rise of cromwell in power , english teachers do n't have time to cover every campaign that he fought , what children are learning the entirety of the civil war ?
