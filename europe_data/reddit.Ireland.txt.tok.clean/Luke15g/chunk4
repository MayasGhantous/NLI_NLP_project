  i like the mantra of `` my rights end where your 's begin '' but islamic erdogan supporters seem happy to have rights that are n't really relevant to them personally stripped from everyone to the detriment of other more secular people and that is a disturbing situation . 
  to the cause of much monetary pain , but at least we are n't greece and things are better off as a result . 
  it also matches the sky . 
  none of those wars were among eu member states and all were the result of extreme nationalism and ethnic politics , exactly the thing that the eu wants to move away from . 
  we are presently enjoying the longest period of peace and cooperation in european history . 
  why do you think that is ? 
  you see these right wing nationalist groups supporting their counterparts in other member states now but you can be sure that should the union dissolve and the borders go up , they would be at each others throat 's like it was the early 20th century instead of the 21st . 
   that 's not democracy , that 's dictatorship actually caring about ep elections and not voting for someone who has a [ 38 % attendance rate ] ( http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-nigel-farage-2.html ) for example might help in that regard . 
  over half of the british meps are part of fucking ukip , if your country actually voted for people who were n't committed to leaving the eu no matter what then you may have gotten along much better and would n't be seen as special little obstructionist snowflakes . 
  hopefully your exit will finally allow for closer unification in europe now that you wo n't be able to veto every motion that does n't benefit you personally . 
  look , you voted to stay so i feel bad for you but you lost and the brexit is happening . 
  are you technically still a member state until 2 years after article 50 ? 
  yes . 
  should the eu put your own country 's well being over the stability of the eu ? 
  if the eu was a company then the uk would be a valuable and important employee but you as a nation just decided to tell everyone `` i 'm quitting , so long fuckers ! '', 
  so even though you have n't handed in your formal resignation the damage is done and the company is interested in how to mitigate the disruption to the work schedule , not how the uk is going to pay it 's mortgage without a job . 
   nobody knows whats going to happen yet . 
  that includes my government , negotiations have n't even formally started yet . 
  this entire thing is plagued with uncertainty and may be for years . 
  [ i 'd suggest you read this article as it explains how serious the outcome of this brexit is for the island of ireland . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/24/northern-irish-peace-sacrificed-english-nationalism ), 
  america does n't have thousands of years of nationalism , war and ethnic cleansing . 
  europe is complicated , that kind of unification will take a lot of time . 
  nobody knows whats going to happen yet . 
  any changes to the border will cause a lot of tension , the brexit completely undermines the good friday agreement . 
  insult and be condescending to your fellow meps as you say their union is a failure . 
  - ... demand a trade deal with them that has all the positives of eu membership with none of the obligations . 
  ---------- i have no sympathy , britain deserves what 's coming to them . 
  just in case anyone is n't aware , irish is a symbolic language here . 
  it is on all official documents and road signs but it is not spoken outside of a few tiny ghaeltacht communities on the west coast . 
  99 % of the population ca n't say anything beyond a couple of simple phrases that were ingrained in youth through pointless repetition , a process in line with our terrible language education policy . 
  christ , ignore this fucker . 
  there is no irish sentiment for leaving the eu [ and this is n't just a `` reddit bubble '' thing either . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ombewmq.png ) the wanker is just spouting off thinking this is how you take advantage of the situation when its just making us look retarded . 
  pro tip enda , the way you take advantage of the brexit is to steal all the uks investment by selling yourself as the only english speaking country left in the eu . 
  the leave campaign said they wanted to two things that conflict with each other , they literally said that people could have their cake and eat it to . 
  my initial point was that 75 % of the `` not competent age group '' saw that such a position did n't make sense and voted to remain . 
   that trumps any economic argument you might make . 
  how can you make that claim ? 
  `` right chaps , we 're skint broke but at least its all on us !, 
  no more eurocrats to blame for all our problems ! '', 
  great , what a genius move . 
  but those are objective things it will lose , the leave campaign can not keep the promise they made of stopping eu contributions , immigration and eu regulations ** and ** retain access to the common market as well as other valuable eu benefits . 
  it does n't make any sense . 
  the leave crowd campaigned with the primary reasons of eu contributions , immigration and eu regulations , all things that would have to be largely forfited a la norway in order to access the common market . 
  the leave campaign has said that they still would want to take advantage of the common market as they would need to in order to not collapse economically . 
  they are going to end up in an objectively worse situation either way . 
  see / u/sit _ down_on_it 's comment on what they will lose in [ this thread ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4pwtzq/we_pay_but_have_no_say_thats_the_reality_of/d4oh7kh ) . 
  well , you say that but then 75 % of them made the objectively correct decision so ... 
  i do n't see the fucking eu wanting to rush off to `` project power '' in some shithole across the planet and even if they did chances are that the us does as well so moot point . 
  second strike ? 
  are you fucking insane ? 
  you are saying the eu should negotiate a trade deal even partly based on getting revenge when the world ends ... did you consider that the uk is still in nato , will always be allied with the us and will certainly also be a target of any nuclear attack on europe which it will retaliate to along with the us anyway ? 
  the uk is n't going to let itself be nuked because it was n't given a favourable trade deal . 
  the overton window shifts left as society progresses , a few hundred years ago the right was content with child labor and slavery while the left wanted to reform and move away from that . 
  the definition of `` right wing '' is n't fixed , it is relative to what is left of it . 
  and then 4 months later you want to start negotiating a deal for yourself on good terms . 
  ridiculous , if they try to do this then the rest of the eu will and rightly should crucify them in negotiations . 
  `` freedom '', 
   they do not see a legal way to force britain to start the process but have piled political pressure on cameron to honor his pledge to launch article 50 negotiations and respect the popular vote . 
   must be explicit  the council spokesman made clear that leaders can not simply choose to interpret something cameron says as the trigger without the prime minister saying clearly he means it to be . 
  how is this not fair ? 
  the eu does not want a blanket of economic uncertainty resting over if for months before negotiations even start . 
  it is in the best interests of europe as well as the uk for this process to begin as quickly as possible if it is actually going to happen . 
  do or do n't but the intentions need to be known and acted upon now , waiting 4 months before even beginning the process is unacceptable . 
  i addressed this in the top 60 % of my comment , maybe you should focus on that instead of ignoring it and only reading the bottom 40 ? 
  free movement and access to the common market are the `` holiday '' , those are the beneifts you get when you `` chip in '' to the eu . 
  well britain refers to the island of great britain and united kingdom refers to the 1707 unification of the kingdoms of england and scotland . 
  when scotland leaves the union both terms as used to describe the nation under the control of london will be false . 
   what privileges do we get free movement among all member states and access to the common market for one . 
  could you potentially negotiate for access to such privileges when you leave ? 
  yes , [ norway has negotiated such a deal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norway%e2%80%93european_union_relations ) and in doing so has had to join schengen and adopt many of the eu laws and requlations required by member states anyway without the authority to actually participate in writing them . 
  the primary argument on behalf of the leave campaign appears to have been more border control and less eu regulation ... having to concede your primary reasons for leaving and losing your seat at the table in order to gain access to the benefits you already have seems pointless and stupid does n't it ? 
   do your friends threaten to punish you , if you leave their club ? 
  if your friends have an agreement where you all chip in to pay for a holiday or something every year and you decide that you do n't want to pay but still want to go then they are n't punishing you when they say sod off . 
  christ , how entitled can you get ? 
  friends are supposed to respect each other , saying that you want to take advantage of your friends while you contribute nothing is saying that * you * are no friend at all . 
   economic penalties against them is one of the ways that they punished them and that led to resentment and anger building up in the german populace and paved the way for ww2 first of all , your country did that . 
  secondly , you are conflating penalties with the loss of benefits that are presently enjoyed . 
  how can you not see the difference ? 
  it is like revoking your own gym membership and then saying that you are being `` penalized '' by no longer having access to all the exercise equipment you made use of . 
  the eu provides multiple benefits to its members , if you leave then you will no longer have access to those benefits . 
  i do n't know what leave voters expected and why many of them do n't understand this . 
  the majority of the uk is not convinced in the idea of the eu , nothing is going to change that immediately . 
  maybe 10 years down the line if their economy has gone to shit and a couple million close-minded pensioners have kicked it then that may change . 
  it may just be england and wales by that point though . 
   i 'm not even sure most 20-year olds are particularly competent to make a sound political decision yet something like 75 % of the 18-24 age bracket voted to remain . 
  i would n't be so quick to dismiss the competency and political awarness of the generation of voters who has immediate access to any piece of information they desire in the palms of their hands . 
  i do n't think you understand something , the eu is a union that offers privileges to its members in order to collectively improve the union as a whole , that is the point of the union and the reason to join in the first place . 
  privileges like free trade , free movement and subsidies where needed from a powerful collective economy . 
  these are ** privileges ** , you are not entitled to them if you are not a member . 
  this is not extortion or punishment , it is merely the fact that if you leave the union you will lose access to the privileges of the union . 
  think the union is bad for you and your country would do better alone ? 
  fine , leave and be alone . 
  you do n't get to have your cake and eat it too . 
  it is n't a threat , the list of benefits for staying in the eu includes things like free trade , movement and countless subsidies . 
  if you give variations of those things anyway to members after they leave then whats the fucking point ? 
  trying to mitigate the damage the brexit will do to britain will only amplify the damage it will do to the eu itself . 
  if your country really wants to draw this process out and cause unnecessary damage to the eu and global markets as a result then do n't expect shit when you try to negotiate new trade deals . 
  you are already in the weaker position and a third of your country is gearing up to secede as well , making this painful now will make your regret it deeply later .
