  about our church , yes i believe it is one of the main reasons for people here being against it so much ( but not all ) and it 's a shame about our education and until the government either attempts to reduce the amount of catholic-ethos schools by building some of other religions or an educate together ( which teaches about religion , but more about the tradition , culture and history of it - i believe they rarely actually teach prayers and such , also most of these schools require no uniform - which is a must in most other schools ) . 
  look at the map of [ http://cf.broadsheet.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/12.jpg] ( educate together ) schools in ireland compared to schools of a [ http://cf.broadsheet.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/22.jpg] ( catholic ethos ) . 
  til dublin is less safe than most european cities . 
  i mean despite `` threatening '' other countries in europe often ( baltics , finland , ukraine , georgia ) . 
  that 's rich , coming from him . 
  no faroe islands ? 
   the gdp ( ppp ) per capita rank would be enough for the 49th place between hungary and russia . 
  now there 's two hungary 's ? 
  apparently two years ago is recently . 
  of course not all 64k live in bucharest but i imagine most of them would do . 
  well if there is such big objection to this one , i would imagine there would be no mosques in bucharest at present , although i 'm probably wrong . 
  i am implying what the end of your statement claims , maybe you just were unable to see that . 
  next from sweden : diwali is a swedish tradition . 
  all swiss must be grateful for liechtenstein not being in the eu . 
  our taoiseach enda kenny once said that ireland hould be communist , or something of the like .

  i told you it would happen ... 
  by that logic , is it fair for cancer patients dying to be chosen by other people ? 
  is there an accurate translation of this ? 
  she wants to die , however she is in a hospital where people watch her 24/7 to make sure she does n't try ( she has attempted before ) . 
  she has suffered from chronic depression since she was a child ; chronic depression shows up in mri scans and the like . 
  while she is healthy physically , she is not mentally . 
  they have tried treating her for three years to little or no success . 
  i suppose some could say that three years is not that long or that she should keep trying treatment . 
  yes , those statements can both be true , depending on the person and the case . 
  for some people , three years is a lifetime and no type of treatment will work to help make the person feel better . 
  while i would be sad if she was a relative of mine , and i will feel sad if she passes anyway , as the doctors , psychologists , psychiatrists , etc in belgium were unable to help her , but you must understand that if a person is going through a lot of pain , whether it be physically , emotionally , mentally that people would want to no longer suffer from their pain . 
  i would not want anyone to go through with that pain and live with it for the rest of their lives . 
  this would be a fantastic ama . 
  of course we excel at those sports because we 're the only country that really cares about it . 
  yes but those sports are n't in the european games ... 
  or maybe get them to commit troops rather than just logistics and trainers . 
  they ( isil ) already killed four italian citizens .

  * prepares for mass downvotes *, 
  i would imagine that if a popular vote were to be held in russia on the topic , that it will pass with flying lgbt colours !, 
   join real demonstrations on the street there were none here in ireland yet :(, 
  great to know !, 
   one type of charger except if you 're in the uk , malta , cyprus or ireland afaik, 
  i really hope this is changed tbh . 
  any parties mention anything about it ? 
  all i remember is some people complaining about a cross in a meeting hall in cork or something . 
  wow , thanks . 
  not proven ? 
  can you elaborate ? 
  just wondering , how are romania and bulgaria risky places ? 
  hi , i 'm uneducated in this regard , can you tell me what a firestick is , and does it work on non-amazon tv 's ? 
  in ireland , in our census , we have a question for religion , ethnicity and their mother tongue/what other languages they speak at the home . 
  could you care to enlighten me a bit more about this ? 
  i think he 's talking about the prejudice the band was talking about , not exactly wildspread racism but i think that 's what he was referring to anyhow . 
  poland can win it this year . 
  anyone have a video for this ? 
  what other european country is russia invading ? 
  before the refugee crisis , we had the third highest rate of approval for migrants . 
  i do n't know if anyone has a statistic for after this refugee crisis actually happened , but it has n't really affected ireland too much . 
  i saw a graph for the mentioned statistic before but i ca n't find it at the moment . 
  i knew it in advance , thanks . 
  quite a bit , in the basque and catalonia being prime examples . 
  to my knowledge , the secessionist region most likely to get independence is catalonia . 
  secessonist groups have committed several attacks , moreso in the basque and andalusia , to my knowledge . 
  if i 'm wrong , please correct me . 
  edited . 
  really ? 
  you do n't know about the troubles ? 
  any irish people ? 
  exactly . 
  our economy is growing , we have a closing unemployment gap , no major racist groups , a 2 % muslim population that are well intergrated , and remember their past heritage . 
  i remember a case recently when a man 's family told the garda\u00ed about him potentially going to syria , that 's how goid we are . 
  i 'm not saying there is no islamophobia or racism , but we certainly are one of the best places for refugees . 
  of course our economy is not as good as that of germany 's , but i 'm again shocked at this low number, 
  kristel linberg is a good faroese singer also . 
  the faroes has surprisingly a lot of music , considering its population and location . 
  does this have literally anything to do with the topic on-hand ? 
  that was what i was refering to . 
  i know it 's different than their policies but it was not always treated ` nicely ' in the media , for example the 2012 documentary on racism and nazism in modern day poland and ukraine ( not that it ai n't bad , but it 's not positive ) . 
  poland was nearly always demonized in the british media . 
  ah sure , we 're all about the rain here in ireland !, 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal_law/criminal_offences/alcohol_and_the_law.html ) since august 2003 it is illegal in ireland to sell alcohol at reduced prices for a limited period during any day , or in other words , happy hour is illegal in ireland .

  to the people that claim there are no moderate muslims , 3 out of the 4 muslims in the parliament voted for same-sex civil partnerships .
