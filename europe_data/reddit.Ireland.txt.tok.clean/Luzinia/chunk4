  in ireland , there is irish that is mandatory unless you get an exemption , as well as english , and an optional foreign language , usually french or german . 
  however , to get into a lot of universities in ireland , you need to have a language other than english or irish . 
  i get 5gb for $ 10 of my $ 20 top up every month , which lasts for a month . 
  it is the same everywhere in the e.u. 
  except for the u.k. , ireland , malta and cyprus , afaik . 
  i literally never said that it was worthless , did i ? 
  i merely said that the eu commissioner for competition said that we could use this money to fund other projects , should we get it . 
  i do n't have a link but the eu commissoner for competition said on irish radio that ireland can also use the money on studf such as infrastructure , educatiom , healthcare , etc. 
  not sure if true but i ca n't find other sources giving proof of this money being forced to be used to pay off the debt , although i 'm not saying i do n't believe them , just interested to see proof of that first . 
  i was more so focusing on the part when you were saying fn was leading the polls , rather than the part of the fn being irrelevant . 
  french presidential elections have two rounds . 
  after the first round , the two candidates with the most votes in raw numbers advance to the second round . 
  there it is common for parties to make pacts to either ensure/prevent a party from winning . 
  the fn are leading polls , but not by massive numbers , and they will most probably advance to the second round . 
  in the second round , the umps or socialists ( probably the ump ) will make a pact so that they 'll urge whoever voted for them in the first round to vote for them in the second round . 
  there are also minor parties like the greens who may carry a few votes over to ump/socialists . 
  in the wikipedia article you linked , just go one heading down below to the second round . 
  there you 'll see le pen is losing by 10-20 % against everyone , except hollande . 
  i hope i got everything right there . 
  even more so , the \u00c9 in rte has a so called `` fada '' over it . 
  shame the article did n't put it in , it would 've been hilarious . 
  dark times indeed for turkey . 
  i 'm not turkish , and i 'd be very interested if a turk could explain to me the meaning behind the name of turkey . 
  and here . 
  just a note that you are welcome here in ireland , and i hope you have a a fantastic life here .

  the `` central office for information technology in the security field '' - short zitis - should start operating next year , reported '' s\u00fcddeutsche zeitung '' , ndr and wdr . 
  corresponding plans presented therefore two state secretaries from the interior ministry and the chancellery on thursday deputies of the grand coalition . 
  the object of the computer expert should be therefore to assist law enforcement and government protectors when read along coded messages on the internet . 
  background are obviously issues of public authorities , phones or messenger apps to crack . 
  police and intelligence services warned the report says the federal government that judicial winding surveillance of security agencies went into space , because more and more app or phone manufacturers such as apple now standard used or internals encryption systems . 
  wanted it specialists to build zitis in the us , the us federal police had this year for weeks argued with the technology company apple , because they wanted to enforce the decryption of an iphone , which had been used by an assassin . 
  one appropriate court order defied apple . 
  ultimately cracked the fbi , the smartphone itself . 
  in the us , there is now a bill , the technology companies would commit to help the state in such cases . 
  the federal government wants the report says go a different way with the building zitis . 
  rather than commit companies to cooperate , the new authority is to enable the state itself in a position to listen to and can read along . 
  zitis should then ask the federal police , bka and the federal office for the protection of the constitution made available techniques . 
  the monitoring itself is not to take over the post on the other hand . 
  therefore especially it specialists are sought for the construction of zitis as `` sz '' , ndr and wdr reported . 
  until 2022 , the authority should reach a workforce of 400 employees . 
  thus a budget in the low double-digit million range is planned for the coming year .

  did you watch the rest of the show ? 
  well , as far as i 'm aware , sweden did n't have elections in 2015 , instead having them in 2014 . 
  while of course already having a relatively high population of muslims already in 2009 ( around 5 % of the population ? 
  ) , i do not think it has much if anything to do with the 2015 refugee crisis because the article states that it is more about other countries becoming better ( which is great ) , while sweden has done less . 
  you can make the argument that politicians are not proposing bills because of several more important topics . 
  the lack of policies has nothing necessarily to do with the worrying statements from the policy makers . 
  while people are voting them into power , i presume the vast majority of swedes will not agree with their views , maybe a rising figure but i do n't have anything to back that off . 
  if you read the article you 'd know it has nothing to do with islam . 
  in northern ireland , they use stv constituencies . 
  it 's not based off of how many votes they gain nationwide , but based off of which candidates get the quota in each constituency . 
  there are a certain amount of candidates allowed to be elected by constituency . 
  [ here 's a video ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-39065379 ) by the bbc describing the northern irish voting system . 
  generally though , the percentage a party gets is relatively equivalent to the amount of seats , however , this is n't always the case . 
  sorry , yes , that 's what i mean . 
  i 've been tired the past while so sorry for any mistakes .

  it has a collective leadership , however , eamonn mccann is registered as the party 's leader with the election commission .
