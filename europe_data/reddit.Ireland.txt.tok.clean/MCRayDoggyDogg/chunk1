your conclusions do n't follow . 
  you are taking 1 example : ** finland ** was n't really independent ** during the time of the ussr ** and coming to universal conclusions : small countries are ** never ** really independent , the ** only ** way for a small country to protects its independence and increase its freedoms are to ally or join an bigger entity . 
  this is some seriously sketchy induction . 
  right , is your point that , when the ussr was around , there was no difference between living in finland and living in the ussr ? 
  i do n't ... what ? 
  it 's not even an example . 
  which country are you talking about ? 
  how would an example of a country that is n't free lead to the conclusion that no small countries are ever free ? 
  uhhhh , what ? 
  fairy nuff . 
   i take it that you believe that this ability to renege gives them full sovereignty ? 
  pretty much . 
  i mean , if there was an active threat to the country that reneged - war , funding for paramilitaries , espionage , etc. 
  or the political process was somehow fucked , then i 'd make an exception . 
  i might ( might ! ), 
  also make exceptions for countries in unions like the eu in that reneging is n't an easy process . 
  but if the only power an outside actor has over you is refusing to play ... shmeh . 
  i guess there needs to be a coercive factor in order for sovereignty to be threatened , otherwise it 's just a trade-off . 
  the analogy was crude . 
  a better one might be promise keeping : if i promise to meet michael at his house at 4 o'clock , i ca n't go to the pub for 4 o'clock as long as i intend to keep the promise . 
  again , we do n't say that a person is less free if they willingly promise something and can renege on their promises ( unless the penalty is death or something else positively harmful ) . 
   their sovereign power to make decisions on policies governed by those agreements is said to be limited when those agreements are recognised by the parties however . 
  i do n't understand this , and have an inkling that this is where our disagreement it . 
  can you elaborate on this ? 
  but they are sovereign not to obey the free trade agreement . 
  it 's someone saying `` i 'm not free to eat chocolate as long as i agree not to eat chocolate '' . 
   small countries are never really independent , they are independent only in the frames confined by external powers . 
  thus the question of independence is moot . 
  there 's clearly a difference between a national government having control as opposed to a pan-european one . 
  it might not be `` real independence '' ( whatever that might be ) , but i doubt / u/igelkotten was talking about some philosophical , non-affected , private realm of volition . 
  i might only be free in the frames confined by external culture ( or society , etc. 
  ) , but there 's still a huge difference between my ` not-quite-real independence ' and institutionalised slavery . 
  there is a thing that people refer to when they talk about national independence , and a federal europe will affect it . 
  the question of independence is most definitely not moot . 
  but there is nothing forcing them into a free trade agreement . 
  i can have complete control of my house , but if i want to have friends over , i have to make tea . 
  my friends do n't control my house , but they can refuse to interact with me . 
  corporations can negotiate to restrict entry through national borders with the eu ? 
  why ? 
   still waiting for that credit for opening to polish citizens years before anyone else too . 
  did you ? 
  sweden and ireland opened to polish citizens when poland joined the eu . 
  that would sort of work , it would keep prices low and hurt the sellers . 
  the problem is that drugs are seen as harmful to those that consume them , that 's the rationale as to why they are illegal . 
  the goal is to stop consumption . 
  ivory is not seen as harmful ( in a non-moral way ) to the consumer . 
  the goal is to stop production . 
  why would the threat of taking ivory and destroying it be worse than the threat of taking ivory and reselling it ? 
  either way , you lose your ivory ( or at least , have to buy it twice ) . 
  neither of those are the claim that the link was posted to back up . 
  assuming the google translate is somewhat readable :  one group of migrant workers from sweden and eastern europe is very important for norway - for the service industry and construction ... 
  they [ eea immigration ] come a few years and then they travel back to their homeland , and therefore there is a net major contribution to norway , says jens ulltveit-moe . 
  this seems to contradict / u/sturle 's comment :  norway have done the calculation for our economy : no group of immigrants are a gain . 
  highly educated immigrants from western democracies included . 
  they all cost more than they pay . 
  you do n't have to chose a side between the british and the ira . 
  no one is defending the ira . 
  it 's possible for both sides to be cunts . 
  that does n't mean it 's okay to kill unarmed civillians you ` suspect ' of doing wrong , then destroying the records . 
  so in answer to your question . 
  i do n't speak gaelic . 
  edit : wait no !, 
  i remembered !, 
  then you have a self-contradictory moral system . 
  i think you mean pluperfect . 
  perfect would be `` i jumped '' . 
  please elaborate, 
  fair point , i can see that there could be some circumstances where the strategy you outlined would be more profitable . 
  whether this strategy would be used in real life would depend on how much extra non-animal testing in the eu costs compared with animal testing outside the eu , as well as the percentage of tests that fail . 
  i do n't know any of these figures . 
  but you 'd still have to prove that product y has gone through the non-animal tests and is safe before selling them into the eu - so you 'd have to do those anyway , which makes the animal testing on product x redundant . 
   cosmetic companies will move to asia/latin america now where they will do the testing . 
  and they wo n't be able to sell into the eu . 
  it 's in the link . 
  that 's like saying that the consensus of everyone over 10 years old is only the consensus of 35 year olds ( the median age ? ) . 
  however , this is aside the point . 
  i am not trying to convince you by saying `` look !, 
  economists think this , you should too ! '', 
  though i may have made my original post a bit too forceful . 
  rather , i should say : there are economists that believe that the corporation tax should n't exist - they do cover a spectrum ( for example , most of the economists in my link advocate more progressive taxation , just in a targeted manner ) . 
  they have arguments which you can read and agree or disagree with . 
  edit : i would suggest searching for `` corporation tax '' in / r/economics - there has been discussion on this issue which yield a similar consensus to those in the links . 
  i 'm on the bus now . 
  i 'll provide different sources in an hour or so if you 'd like . 
  i could n't tell you for certain , but i do n't know how i could convince you of economic hypothesis if you are n't convinced by economists . 
  i did provide a link ... [ another page on the subject ] ( http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/07/18/156928675/episode-387-the-no-brainer-economic-platform ) says  economists from across the political spectrum . 
  [ not the best link ] ( http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/07/19/157047211/six-policies-economists-love-and-politicians-hate ) but ... economists across the spectrum tend to think that corporation tax is a bad idea in general . 
  edit : i may have overstated this claim - it should read `` there are many economists , from across the spectrum , that would favour abolishing corporation tax . '', 
  this has been discussed on / r/economics with a similar concensus - http://www.reddit.com/r/economics/comments/gd3b8/eliminate_corporate_taxes_entirely/, 
  from the [ wall street journal ] ( http://online.wsj.com/article/sb10000872396390443507204578022253548973258.html ) ( and , i gather , a widely accepted view . ), 
   many of the beneficiaries of that bank bailout were themselves privately owned financial institutions in germany , france and elsewhere in the eu . 
  the late brian lenihan , then ireland 's finance minister , later made it clear that ireland first guaranteed the banks ' debts , in september 2008 , and later paid out on those guarantees in full , under heavy pressure from the european central bank . 
  the ecb feared that defaults by the irish banks could lead to huge losses in larger eu economies and a more generalized banking crisis . 
   whether that assessment was accurate at the time , we 'll never know . 
  what we do know is that ireland , in effect , bailed out foreign banks owed money by irish ones , and that irish taxpayers were left with the tab . 
  so , yeah , if ireland let their banks default , it would have become a massive european banking crisis . 
  there is nothing in the article about  tacit sympathy from their community [ or ] ... a dampening of charges , attenuating them out of fear from violent protests by said community . 
  i disagree with roodammy44 's comment , but nothing you said has shown that this article is relevant to / r/europe ( which you do n't need to convince me of ) . 
   talking about it on the internet does naught to change anything . 
  are you under the impression that r/europe thinks this comment section will change the world ?
