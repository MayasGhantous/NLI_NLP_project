lol at the serbian one . 
  that was an `` art '' thing against domestic violence . 
  that was pretty pathetic . 
  stick to just posting the articles , mate . 
  the study is from 2005 . 
  for fuck 's sake . 
  feels great dropping a turd that was once nothing but certified halal food into a thousand year old serb monastery . 
  but , i am no albanian . 
   you guys made so many threats in 91 and look how that turned out . 
  do n't make the same mistakes again . 
  how are serbs in rsk doing again ? 
  no , every bosnian citizen and the eu need to get behind an operation storm 2.0 . 
  serbs are just simply unable to live in any non-orthodox country in peace . 
  and you would be right . 
  i 'm not . 
  you can actually sift through my history and find out i 've already said it . 
  i have a feeling that you are n't actually atheist . 
   you are of bosnian or croatian descent no ? 
  i have no bosnian or croatian blood . 
  lol . 
  but i 'm still not from croatia or bosnia . 
  of course . 
  [ i am of the suspicion that some serb accounts are held by a single owner . 
  you made a new account just to say that ? 
  there are also a few in london . 
  you see : bosnian serbs are really just bosniaks who got their turban in a twist over the last 100 or so years . 
  they 'll come to their senses after a few storms . 
  damn . 
  should have used bigger rocks . 
  correct !, 
  just give them this [ map ] ( http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/mediterranean-coastal-cities/figure-02-1pia.eps/image_original ) next time . 
  that will teach them !, 
  actually , you 've got it backwards . 
  the more new tensions that occur , the * less likely * that people will be likely to vote for independence . 
  why ? 
  dodik 's been increasing tensions and nationalism for more than 10 years now and people are quite frankly getting sick of his ( and other politicians ) shit . 
  it seems that the orthodox croatians have been getting feistier these last few days . 
  of course not . 
  the yugoslav wars were started by the great devil called the west and its conspirators . 
  of course not . 
  but you need to have the absolute majority of people to want it . 
  ~ 20 % of rs do n't want it ( non-serbs ) and if the serbs who do want it is any bit less than 65 % then you simply wo n't get it . 
  and that 's assuming 100 % serbs even want independence . 
  which i highly doubt is the case . 
  i was referring to the general yugoslav wars with the second statement . 
  the link was a reminder for the other serb that shit in kosovo did n't mainly occur in 2004 . 
   2000 estimate come on , man . 
  interesting that rs ' population has dropped 100,000 between then and 2013 . 
  edit : i know why . 
  3.227 $ gdp per capita in 2009 .

  lose . 
  cry : `` but it 's not fair !! '', 
  [ as of 2008 , 35 % of bosniaks and 8.5 % of croats had returned to republika srpska , while 24 % of serbs who left their homes in territories controlled by bosniaks or croats , had returned to their pre-war communities . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republika_srpska#impact_of_war ) i 'm 96.8 % sure you pulled that number out of your ass . 
   2004 massive conflict on kosovo between albanians and serbs , most of serbs forced to flee from kosovo : i lol 'd . 
   rs has a majority ( 96.8 % ) serb demographics . 
  do you have a source for those numbers ? 
  i saw some numbers from the election time on this subreddit that seemed to paint the serb population around 80 % . 
  judging by the parties that were voted for . 
  again ? 
  did n't it fail last time ? 
  is n't half of the rs government ( i.e. , the opposition parties ) against this ? 
   not one woman or child was killed at srebrenica . 
  here we go with the serb bullshit again . 
  here are two examples , first being a woman and the second a child . 
   name  nasiha nuhanovi\u0107  born  18.09.47  age  48 --  name  nesib muhi\u0107  born  1984  age  11 [ source ] ( http://www.rferl.org/fullinfographics/infographics/27114531.html# ) edit : here are some more examples of `` raiders '' :  name  abdurahman / selim / avdi\u0107  born  07.06.10  age  85  name  selma / salim / musi\u0107  born  17.09.87  age  8, 
  sure . 
  but it does n't seem northern ireland faced the same issues that bosnia did . 
  [ northern ireland 2011 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/map_of_predominant_national_identity_in_the_2011_census_in_northern_ireland.png/1280px-map_of_predominant_national_identity_in_the_2011_census_in_northern_ireland.png ), 
   what was happening in some places all over republika srpska *, 
  ah , ok . good to know people were allowed to be practicing muslims on the territory of republika srpska without fear . 
  it 's good to know that the serbs did n't systematically target mosques or anything like that . 
  care to explain this ? 
  [ for the whole region , i.e the municipalities of srebrenica , bratunac , vlasenica and skelani , the serb authorities claimed previously that about 1400 people were killed due to attacks committed by the bh army forces for the period of may 1992 to march 1995 , when srebrenica was under the control of naser oric . 
  now the figure has become 3,500 serbs killed . 
  this figure may have been inflated . 
  taking the term `` victims '' as defined previously , these figures just does not reflect the reality . 
   if it were a religion inspired and carried out war you would have something like current iraq where isis is killing people because of their religion regardless of their thoughts or sides in the whole conflict . 
  which is what happened in bosnia too . 
  please continue telling me that serbs did not target bosniaks because of the fact they happened to be muslims . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0_tp66myru molim vas gospodine , seri vi\u0161e . 
  is the serb targeting of muslims and catholics while leaving the orthodox nations alone not enough for you ? 
  you probably even want evidence that serbs started the war , do n't you ? 
  lol . 
  stop pretending as if the serbs were n't fighting a `` holy war '' to purge all non-serb/orthodox christians from their lands . 
  #euro genocides by country :  2013 : russian federation  2012 : serbia  2011 : serbia  2010 : serbia  2009 : serbia  2008 : serbia  2007 : serbia  2006 : bih  2005 : serbia  2004 : serbia  2003 : bih  2002 : bih  2001 : bih  2000 : bih  1996-99 : bih but if you are going to tell me that serbia is the european country that has accepted the most refugees from the wars , then lol . 
  serbia only * produces * refugees and that 's because it 's a shithole . 
  [ excellent trolling though . 
  ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sm.pop.refg.or ) never forget 2010-2014 anti-serb genocide !, 
   renegade  led by the highest general in the vrs , ratko mladic . 
  are you fucking retarded ? 
  and where is that proof ? 
  my post was in reference to the icty . 
  but , yes , i agree . 
  they 're all crooks . 
  it was a tongue-in-cheek remark , mate . 
  besides , a single serb death in war is genocide to serbs . 
  none of the non-serbs you listed did anything wrong .
