  that obviously suggests you 're talking about the economics of the eu , not something else , such as social/cultural issues . 
  if you wanted to talk about social/cultural issues , for example , you could do that . 
  you 'd have to look at other things , like approval ratings ( which is 35 % approval , 38 % neutral , and 25 % negative - 2016 figures ) . 
  but that 's not what your comment said . 
  you were talking about economics . 
  these `` common laws '' which every country in the eu had a referendum on to say `` yes , we want to integrate these laws into our country '' before they joined in the first place ? 
  please explain to me why you think germany has a greater say within the eu . 
  show me the basis for that thought . 
  and not `` only a fool ... blah blah '' . 
  show me proof . 
  there 's far too little of it these days . 
  so , there were only 3 negatively scored comments that i can see . 
  of those , two make reference to the eu being `` anti-democratic '' . 
  if you bothered try to understand how the eu works , you would know there is a considerable amount of democracy involved , even if it is n't a 100 % democratic system . 
  additionally , if you bothered to read through the comments , there are a few which are upvoted , and are discussing the fact that they want a greater democratic control over the eu . 
  if i remember correctly , a referendum has only ever been run twice over an eu issue , is in relation to the lisbon treaty , which ireland rejected . 
  however , the eu can issue up to 3 versions of a proposed referendum - and guess what , the second version of the lisbon treaty was different to the first , and was adjusted to accommodate irish concerns . 
  after that , it went through . 
  while , yes , most of those discussing it here are in favour of increasing co-operation between eu countries , i fail to see any which are denying the opinion of those who do not want further co-operation , or why they voted to leave . 
  `` off the top of my head , the main ones i heard were a lack of democratic control over the eu , a failure to deal with the migrant crisis collectively ( so countries near the border are often being left to deal with the problem or people who think we should just close the border completely because they think refugees = terrorists ) , and the issues with the euro ( single currency but different financial policies/needs of different countries ) . '', 
   we apparently need even more strict regulations when countries listen to the will of their people instead of the eu . 
  point to me where that was said . 
   throw in a super-national police force with no oversight too , that 's great . 
  i believe the description of it was a european fbi . 
  unless you guys operate the fbi without oversight , then that 's just made up by you . 
  also , if you went to the next comment : `` i 'm actually afraid to start with the military . 
  fix the democracy issue first . 
  state clearly that you want people to have a voice in the eu , not the eu to have a voice on the peoples ... 
  fix the corruption . 
  then , move on to law enforcement , show people that the eu can do well together . 
  make a foundation for the social protection of eu citizens ... ''  that is n't criticism of the eu . 
  it 's expressing how the eu is doing a great job really , i guess all those comments actually criticising it were just figments of my imagination . 
  `` most people have no idea of what the structure of the eu government looks like . 
  which entity is responsible for what and how people in those organizations are chosen . 
  many people , especially opponents , like to attribute decissions they consider bad to undemocratic eu organizations , where it 's often the individual member states pushing the decission through the council of the european union ( which contains representatives of member governments ) . '', 
  `` i 'm actually afraid to start with the military . 
  fix the democracy issue first . 
  state clearly that you want people to have a voice in the eu , not the eu to have a voice on the peoples ... 
  fix the corruption '' `` well , a great first step would be having truly paneuropean parliamentary elections where everyone can vote for whoever they want , as opposed to only their national candidates . '', 
  `` i do n't totally agree because you can have a confederation with a more democratic system : an equal balance of powers between the parliament and the council ( the govs ) . '', 
  tell me again how this is saying the eu is all-great . 
  so , i counted how many referendums relating to the eu there have been , and counted the approved/rejected . 
  approved : 40 rejected : 18 which is a far cry to your `` most of the time an eu directive have been put to a referendum it 's been shot down . '', 
  please educate yourself on how the eu is run .

  germany does n't `` run '' the eu . 
  in case you did n't read the articles i provided you - the eu is n't a `` democratic '' institution as one would think . 
  it 's got a directly elected part , and 2 parts which are composed of those nominated/elected by each country . 
  if there 's decisions being made , it 's most likely being made by every country in the eu , by either the elected governments , or the elected governments and the elected parliament . 
  if there 's someone to blame , it 's a country 's government . 
  the comic is poking fun at the french elections , saying that the french are going to/have tried to top the us/uk/turkey at who is going to make the worst decision in the last 2 years , referencing the us electing trump , the uk 's brexit , and turkey electing a dictator . 
  at least , that 's how i understood it . 
  please educate yourself on how the eu is run .

  germany does n't `` run '' the eu . 
  additionally , we do n't all have the same laws !, 
  we have some common ones , but we still govern ourselves for the most part !, 
   legitimate criticism of the eu ? 
  [ huh , it 's almost as if we did n't just have a discussion on this , here in this sub !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6615sj/5_days_before_french_presidentiel_election_here/dgewwgh/ ), 
  right , yes , of course . 
  that 's the perfect excuse to base your claims off of !, 
  northern ireland you mean - ireland is not the uk . 
  also , if you 're going to make such such outlandish claims , at least get some god damn proof . 
  yeeeaaaah , i 'm going to ask for a source on that 10 % . 
  also , being muslim = / = a place being a shithole . 
  we do n't need more islamophobia here thank you . 
  i hear loads of americans and brits complaining about the `` rise of islam '' in europe , but i do n't see anyone else complaining about it really . 
  i ca n't comment , because last i checked , ireland had accepted one of the lowest refugee numbers of the whole eu . 
  do you mind if i ask for what it 's like over there in belgium , in a bit more detail ? 
  maybe someone else can explain better , but this seems interesting : https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/how-did-uk-end-up-voting-leave-european-union, 
  is he your version of a prime minister/president ? 
  when was he elected , and when are the next elections ? 
  what particular policies are unpopular ? 
  i googled `` tangentopoli '' but am getting articles from 1992 - is that correct ? 
  thanks for the explanation though !, 
  thank you !, 
  because it 's a joke , and most people find jokes funny , even political ones , because they do n't always need to represent a view . 
  could someone eli5 who the linke , gr\u00fcnen , fdp , sonstige parties are please ? 
  i am not up to date with my german politics . 
  it 's a joke . 
  people can make jokes without needing to express an opinion ... 
  might be talking with the wrong people . 
  / r/turkey seems pretty anti-erdogan ( though i do n't speak turkish , and have n't translated the turkish comments ) . 
  that said , akp does seem to have quite the support .

  those are some interesting facts . 
  though , the argument was that it 's the least successful free trade zone . 
  my statistics are presented to counter that argument , not the value of an entity 's gdp change . 
  also , to argue that numbers come down to sheer size , then a more precise area of comparison must be considered . 
  for example , the land area of the usa is 9.834 million km \u00b2 , compared to the eu 's 4,475,757 km2 . 
  or , if you want to compare population , the usa has 318.9 million , and the eu has 508 million inhabitants . 
  what do you consider `` size '' ? 
  as for your `` socio-political disaster '' - that 's a different discussion entirely , one i have n't made any comment on , nor will i , because it 's a debate that i know too little on to discuss it either way . 
  you might appreciate [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911 ) . 
  for reference , the population of the uk is 64.1 million . 
  it 's a joke bud . 
  it 's just a joke , relax bud .
