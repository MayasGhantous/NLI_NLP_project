  https://redd.it/5uk5d2 please note that post is 2 months old , so polls have changed . 
  1 ) this comic , intended for fun , is n't about the eu . 
  2 ) no one here has ever said the eu is perfect . 
  in fact , i recall a discussion just yesterday here about things the eu should do to improve it !, 
  right ... http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/eu-position-in-world-trade/, 
  oh , and please note , that post was 2 months ago , polls most likely have changed considerably . 
  yeah , probably this . 
  last time ireland had snow , the shaded corner of our garden had snow almost a week after the areas in sunlight had long melted the snow . 
  maybe i read it wrong , but that 's how it came across to me . 
  but you 're right with your analogy regarding texas and the usa , and it does apply to the eu too . 
  my apologies . 
  yeah , i understand why it was imposed , france did take quite the beating . 
  but yeah , the sanctions were a bit tough for the country . 
  i did n't say they did n't have responsibility , i said they did n't start it . 
  sure , they definitely hold a lot of the responsibility for the war . 
  i 'm about to head out the door , so i ca n't find the exact comment , but there was a discussion on the chances of her winning in one of the comments [ here ] ( https://redd.it/65we9h ) if you can find it . 
  you 're welcome . 
  to be fair , it 's not exclusive to the us . 
  europe has it 's own fair share of fools , 
  pretty sure scotland voted to remain , and are being forced out due to a majority in england and wales . 
  the germans did n't start world war i. 
  that said , that does not mean they were n't responsible for the terrible things they did . 
  a large portion of hitler 's support came from the anger over the extremely unfair war reparations they were forced to pay . 
  e : clarification . 
  what ? 
  france and britain are n't eu ? 
  news to me .

  then you have two choices : stick with that iteration of the eu , or work out still why they do n't want to further progress and from there , fix the issues arising . 
  what do you mean ? 
  still do n't want further integration/federalism ? 
  i think the main two points people want to reform in the eu have been brought up now . 
  pr , and greater democratic control over the eu . 
  i agree with both of these points , and feel that if both of these were reformed , the eu would go a lot smoother . 
  the last thing that i think people will look to have control over , is their country 's ability to leave the eu in the future , if it pushes towards a more federal state . 
  e : oh , and issues arising re : migrant crisis handling and citizen 's concerns over the euro and the economic crisis .

  i do n't think you realise just how unpopular that decision was . 
  a large portion of our population still holds a grudge about that to this day . 
  now , if you cared to spend five minutes googling , you would discover that this `` second vote '' was caused by the eu , and less our government . 
  the eu can issue up to three iterations of a treaty which must be rejected before it can fully be rejected . 
  furthermore , ireland was the only state which sent the treaty to the public to be voted on . 
  finally , to believe that any country or it 's people should be banned from criticising another for any reason , is not only stupid , but inherently dangerous . 
  and , i 'm pretty sure , illegal . 
  so much for caring about your citizen 's health ... or for the future of energy ... or your economy ... 
  the channel works both ways . 
  then please enlighten me . 
  i should add that the us system also has insitutions which must approve a considerable number of actions by the us president - none of which appear to be present in the turkish version . 
  actions include ( but are not limited to ) : approving heads of departments ( ministers ) , approving the deployment of the army/air force/navy ( at all ) and marines ( past a certain time limit ) , approving president nominated judges . 
  so if i understand correctly , you 're angry that they 're preparing to move out of a country that no longer wants to be associated with the institution which the newspapers are a part of ? 
  thankfully , / r/europe tends to accept facts , does n't capslock every title , and is willing to accept criticism of their own country . 
  there are strict requirements which a country must meet to be permitted to join the eu . 
  if i remember correctly , turkey never met those goals . 
  in addition , it is kinda crazy to blame the eu for the countries entire fall into the state it is now . 
  if one institution can cause such a fundamental change in a country , when the people did n't want to meet that institution 's requirements , then the country needs to take another look at itself, 
  no problem . 
  thank you for actually making an effort to understand , rather than just going with the flow . 
  at least in the usa they can , and do fight back against power-hungry politicians . 
  usa politicians know to keep their dirty deeds out of the public eye to keep their heads . 
  i 've updated my response for further reading . 
  yes . 
  he will be able to set a wide range of policies , putting people who support his cause in positions to do just that , while opposition parties which would act as a counterweight to extremism gets left in the dust . 
  additionally , the power to set such a large number of state judges allows one to force one 's personal opinion on how law should be done on a huge number of people . 
  furthermore , it means that since judges are so essential in deciding if certain scenarios are legal or not , he has even more say in matters which he supports , which may not be so popular with the public . 
  the public , which once the president vote in , can do little to stop or influence the president . 
  essentially , that power is the very definition of a dictator - the only difference being he was voted in by the public . 
  however , in erdogan 's case , he was prime minster from 2003 to 2014 , and has been president since 2014 . 
  this new presidential system would allow him to remain in power until 2026 or something like that . 
  in europe , i do n't think anyone has been in power that long since world war two , when hitler and mussolini were in power . 
  even then , they did not stay in power as long as this new system will allow erdogan to be in power . 
  by 2026 , erdogan will have been in power in turkey for 23 years . 
  for comparison , hitler was in power for 12 . 
  the maximum presidents in the us can be in power for is 8 . 
  for further knowledge why this is such a bad thing ; erdogan has been actively arresting members of the public and members/leaders of opposition parties for a while now , especially since the coup last year , which has allowed him to crack down on any sort of dissent against him . 
  even reporters have been arrested , and many members of the public today are in jail over `` terrorism charges '' - while no proof of any terrorism has been provided . 
  even more so , erdogan has been having people jailed for insulting him , even going so far to try have a german comedian arrested over his mockery of erdogan . 
  this level of power combined with such attitudes are exactly what is seen in dictators . 
  that 's why he 's being compared to a dictator . 
  he is one . 
  yay !, 
  thanks . 
  from my understanding , to abolish the parliamentary style system and make it more like the us system , where the power rests in the president , rather than in a prime minister . 
  it would also give the president power to set ministers , remove them , and decide half of the state judges . 
  people with more knowledge , feel free to correct me . 
  irish turks voted 80 % no , 20 % yes . 
  taken from / r/ireland , http://aa.com.tr/en, 
  what makes you think ireland will be safe from all this ? 
  on a more serious note , ireland wo n't leave the eu , we 're dependant on eu ;d, 
  well yes , you will have more counters the more people you have . 
  but 45 million votes in 45 minutes ? 
  anyway , turns out those figures were wrong . 
  the state media was claiming that 100 % of ballot boxes had been opened , when the referendum/election committee said only 60 had been opened . 
  suspiciously , they seem to have managed to guess the correct figures . 
  i was really hoping i would n't have to say this , but damn , they so obviously rigged this referendum . 
  hopefully , i really hope that the outcome of this is rejected and the leaders of it removed . 
  plus the election committee decided to allow ballots that were n't properly filled out through , and there 's a video of someone stamping like 8 `` yes '' ballots ... 
  very sketchy .
