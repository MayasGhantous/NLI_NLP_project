   obviously present day actions should account for the majority of opinion , but the idea that the past does n't matter at all is laughable my point is n't that they do n't matter at all - i am saying you seem to care too much about past events . 
   99.999999 % of actions of any human and any country is for self benefit . 
  exactly my point ... the us gains a lot from their presence in europe . 
  to think otherwise is laughable . 
  they could have withdrawn at any time . 
  ask yourself why did n't they . 
   the morgenthau plan was most heavily pushed by france and russia the article seems to suggest otherwise . 
  source for your claim please . 
  not all turks trust in erdogan . 
  just check out / r/turkey from time to time . 
  that said , your point has been brought up before , i just do n't know if there was an explanation for it . 
  i do n't see how it could be . 
  it can only be a compliment . 
  i read the first comment very quickly and did n't see the `` overeducated '' . 
  when i saw it in your comment , i could n't believe it , and had to go back to re-read it . 
  well , if you 're spying on someone , that suggests you ( should ) have good reason to believe that they 're interested in acting against you . 
  if you find proof that there 's someone going to act hostile to you , it would be silly not to neutralise the threat before it comes to the fore . 
  so , by spying on someone , you 're stating that you do n't trust that person to support you , that they 're more likely to become hostile to you . 
  whether or not they earned a `` bad guy '' reputation in wwi , that does not give you a right to state false facts . 
  in addition , no country is perfect , and if we judged every country by 2 events in the country 's entire history , then there would n't be a single country on this planet that could claim to be anything other than bad . 
  i 'd be quite happy to be called over-educated . 
  well , i 'm pretty sure the last time the group which conducted this study had their results published here , it also hit the front page , and that was without any typos , and the us was way up on the trust list . 
  that 's not the point . 
  allies should trust each other , not looking over the other 's back , ready to backstab at any moment . 
  agreed , no country is perfect . 
  but the points you bring up have already been discussed in this thread , and shot down . 
  i 'll repeat what i said to someone else bringing up the same points earlier : `` you seem to be equating appreciation for past events to deserved level of trust . 
  that 's not how it works , nor should it . 
  we 're all grateful for the downfall of nazi germany , the us has done great things ( and not so great things ) in the past . 
  on top of that , they were n't done for altruistic reasons , they were done for the benefit of the us . 
  but that was about 75 years ago - this is today , now . 
  different people , different policies , different goals . 
  trust is something that will change over time . 
  this is evident from this ( http://www.infratest-dimap.de/typo3temp/_processed_/csm_folie25_03_cd42747570.png ) '' as for things relating to germany , then have this one : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morgenthau_plan, 
  a shame . 
  thanks for posting this none the less . 
  yeah , that 's a good point . 
  hopefully all things go well and smoothly in the french elections . 
  third time trying to type this ... third times a charm ? 
   what about the fact that almost all of nato 's funds come from the u.s. ? 
  that is the uss ' business - i 'm talking about eu and europe in relation to the us , not nato . 
   how about the fact that pretty much all of europe depends on the u.s. to solve international issues ? 
  pretty sure its the eu that is trying to solve our problems with erdogan . 
  the eu trying to solve the migrant crisis . 
  europe trying to solve the increase in terrorism in europe . 
  pretty sure us is n't involved in these , bar the last one . 
  europe deals with international issues that concern it . 
  just because they do n't involve nato or the us , does not mean it does n't have international issues . 
   the military of the u.s. gives european countries & asian countries such as japan & s. korea security . 
  sure it does . 
  but it does not do that solely out of altruism - the us gains from a stable europe , which is why they 've always invested troops here . 
  on top of that , european countries , even those not in nato , have supported the us in conflicts that they would not have been involved in otherwise . 
  that is the agreement that has been reached . 
  you scratch my back , i 'll scratch yours . 
  to think it 's a one-way gains system is silly . 
  besides , it 's the uss choice to invest as much as they do into europe/their own military . 
  they continue to do so because they know the benefits of doing so . 
   a lot of countries rely on the u.s. for military aid & economic aid . 
  that 's inevitable . 
  sure . 
  but europe relies less than i think you realise . 
  i 'll give them a read and get back to you . 
  thanks . 
  oh people have such short memories ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_war_crimes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/project_mkultra https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_radiation_experiments#experiments_performed_in_the_united_states https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_cover-up_of_japanese_war_crimes such a shame ... 
  you suggest anyone is in a position to judge anyone else . 
  except germany did n't start wwi ... 
  it was only a part of the losing side . 
  as for the second ww , a lot of hitler 's support came from incredibly unfair forced war reparations forced upon it by the wwi allies . 
  that said , nazi germany was responsible for wwii , and hitler will always be an asshole . 
  mind clarifying which genocide germany is responsible for `` recently '' ? 
  if you mean 50 + years ago , why do n't we go all the way and refer to america 's genocide of native americans ? 
  and finally , i do n't see germany trying to `` high road '' anyone - it 's simply an opinion that they do n't trust the new us gov. 
  get off your high horse . 
  i would ask if it 's anti-american , or anti-trump . 
  or something else . 
  hey op , i like your work . 
  well done . 
  the colour contrast is pretty good . 
  the north arrow and distance line are nice touches . 
  the explanation of innovation index in the top of the image is very very handy , do n't have to go looking it up myself . 
  the source for the definition is excellent to have , given how prone reddit is to not providing sources to claims . 
  however , a numerical value rather than `` worst '' to `` best '' would be appreciated . 
  i would be interested in a more in depth comparison between irish regions , rather than just comparing the b.m.w. 
  region with munster + gda . 
  i 'm honestly not sure what point you 're trying to make . 
  i ca n't comment on german politics , i do not follow it . 
  however , i am interested in your claims , and would ask for sources so i can read into it . 
  go ahead ero , try it , make my day . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_foreign_aid#recipients i do n't see any european countries on this list . 
  perhaps you could be a bit more specific ? 
  edit : so , i checked ... `` total foreign aid , of all kinds , was an estimated $ 35.3 billion in 2014 , and $ 5.9 billion of that was military financing with another $ 105.6 million for international military education and training , according to state department figures on foreign assistance ( see table 3b ) . 
  most of the military financing ( 75 percent ) went to israel and egypt . 
  that 's followed by iraq , jordan and pakistan . 
  the countries trump mentioned -- saudi arabia , japan , germany and south korea -- did n't receive any foreign military financing , though saudi arabia received $ 10,000 for military education and training . 
  total u.s. 2014 spending was about $ 3.8 trillion , making foreign aid 0.9 percent of federal spending , and foreign military aid plus the military training aid 0.16 percent . '', 
  source : http://www.factcheck.org/2016/04/u-s-foreign-military-support/, 
  it 's amazing to see , 
  best of luck with your german classes !, 
  i 've heard the same . 
  should try working on learning a bit of german myself over the summer .
