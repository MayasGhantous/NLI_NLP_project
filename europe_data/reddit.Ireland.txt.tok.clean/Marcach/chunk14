  if i remember correctly , trump wants germany to pay it 's fair share , because that 's what was signed in agreement , not over a matter of trust . 
  besides , if you look to the trust levels a few months back , they were considerably higher . 
  not sure who you 're trying to respond to but ... well , considering france is on the same continent , with no borders between the two , i do n't think they need compounds in germany . 
  russia is n't part of the eu , and has no reason to be in germany ( note , is n't nato designed to keep the soviets out of germany ? ) . 
  gb is , well , gb , they 're out defending the west . 
  besides , they 're much closer than the us , and ( for now ) part of the eu , where borders do n't apply going to germany ... by the way , just because the us helped rebuild and re-establish a government , does n't mean the us should get everlasting trust from germany . 
  this point has already been heavily discussed . 
  dunno what phone you 're using , but mine shows the flair with the `` typo : 29 % ... '', 
  that might have worked if it was done before it hit / r/all - removing a post from / r/all is viewed quite negatively here on reddit . 
  also , it was n't a joke , it was a typo . 
  op said so himself . 
  i have plenty of times mistyped a figure . 
  just because you do n't , does n't mean it does n't happen . 
  it is often a case where i press it , but do n't seem to press hard enough , as my computer does n't register the press . 
  agreed . 
  `` gross means big in german , that meaning is retained in english in some phrases - i.e. 
  ` gross exaggeration ' . '', 
  i 'd like to see it too . 
  `` gross means big in german , that meaning is retained in english in some phrases - i.e. 
  ` gross exaggeration ' . '', 
  ca n't edit titles . 
  best that could be done , has been , which is add a flair noting the typo . 
  so , like , the commonweath ? 
  i am glad you found the articles interesting . 
  in truth , i am actually yet to see any direct quotes by trump which supports these claims , all i 've seen is the claims by news papers , websites and people in general . 
  that said , the eu is such a large part of europe as a whole , that if one is said to be anti-eu , it 's almost equated to being anti-european . 
  hence , by encouraging more `` brexits '' , he is anti-eu , which makes him anti-european . 
  as for an eu military , that 's something that 's being discussed , and there is much debate surrounding it , by pro-eu federalists , and those that are against a greater eu military . 
  eh , yeah , we are human after all . 
  mistakes happen . 
  if you care so little , why bother commenting ? 
   beyond that im trying to figure out what value you bring to the table . 
  other than the fact that they 're your 5th biggest trading partner ? 
   terror hotbed news to me  unlike europe has ever seen in modern history i mean , at least we 're no longer at war with each other like never before , right ? 
   you 're a part of nato , an organization set up after world wars caused by your country 1 ) yeah , so was the eu , and iraq , afganistan , those wars happened after wwii , gon na say everything is to blame on the germans ? 
  many of which were not around during wwii ? 
  2 ) `` it is often said that the north atlantic treaty organization was founded in response to the threat posed by the soviet union . 
  this is only partially true . 
  in fact , the alliance 's creation was part of a broader effort to serve three purposes : deterring soviet expansionism , forbidding the revival of nationalist militarism in europe through a strong north american presence on the continent , and encouraging european political integration . '',

  plus , it 's only between eu countries , outside the eu borders still apply . 
  wrong again !,

  do n't know about you , but i like my facts fresh - so , got a source for your claims ? 
  trump is believed to be supporting the collapse of the eu because of his comments a few months ago , along with comments made by his likely envoy to the eu .

  man , this has hit / r/all and now all the salt comes flowing in . 
  dude , chill , op said earlier that it was a typo . 
  oh , right . 
  thanks anyway !, 
  i do n't think people have forgotten - i think it is a simple case where the current us government can not be trusted to operate in such a way that supports the eu , or even simply europe . 
  forgive my ignorance , but to whom ? 
  atp and someone else ? 
  `` the u.s. policy was to promote a united states of europe , and to this end the committee was used to discreetly funnel cia funds - by the mid 50 's acue was receiving roughly $ 1,000,000 usd per year - to european pro-federalists supporting such organizations as the council of europe , the european coal and steel community , and the proposed european defence community '' `` the end of an article appearing in the daily telegraph in september 2000 noted that : `` the state department also played a role . 
  a memo from the european section , dated june 11 , 1965 , advises the vice-president of the european economic community , robert marjolin , to pursue monetary union by stealth . 
  it recommends suppressing debate until the point at which `` adoption of such proposals would become virtually inescapable '' '' source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_committee_on_united_europe, 
  make sure to get everyone you know out and voting !, 
  hopefully all goes well . 
  if i may ask , what are the opinion polls like ? 
  you seem to be equating appreciation for past events to deserved level of trust . 
  that 's not how it works , nor should it . 
  we 're all grateful for the downfall of nazi germany , the us has done great things ( and not so great things ) in the past . 
  on top of that , they were n't done for altruistic reasons , they were done for the benefit of the us . 
  but that was about 75 years ago - this is today , now . 
  different people , different policies , different goals . 
  trust is something that will change over time . 
  this is evident from this ( http://www.infratest-dimap.de/typo3temp/_processed_/csm_folie25_03_cd42747570.png ), 
  i did n't know that actually . 
  i had intended to look it up , but had n't gotten around to it yet . 
  thanks for writing up a summary . 
  thanks . 
  this is another great response . 
  thank you . 
  hey , someone outside ireland actually knows what d\u00e1il \u00c9ireann is . 
  great comparison , thanks !, 
  thanks !, 
  exactly the sort of answer i am looking for . 
  thank you . 
  this is a good , detailed answer . 
  thank you . 
  two questions though . 
  1 ) `` geert wilders calls for a nexit referendum , so i 'd imagine so . 
  '' , do you mean `` if geert ... '' or something else ? 
  sentence just does n't make v.much sense to me . 
  2 ) what is the `` tweede kamer '' ? 
  have a family coat of arms , did n't know about personal coat of arms . 
  no , i 'm not sharing a picture . 
  i concur , gun control should be multiple choice . 
  that 's crazy . 
  good to know . 
  thanks !, 
  did n't know the brazilians were mad over it , but then again i do n't know any brazilians . 
  good to know though . 
  agreed , less popular than the states , but still popular, 
  my college has an american football club - but i never have seen anyone play it or even talk about it , even in the university newspaper . 
  gaa , football ( soccer ) and rugby is much , much more popular . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-news-second-eu-referendum-leave-voters-regret-bregret-choice-in-millions-a7113336.html that said , there has n't been anything to suggest this since that article , which is quite old by now . 
  regardless , i wish people would supply facts with sources when making a statement . 
  not doing so is creating a plague worldwide right now . 
  from what i can tell , quite popular , but i never played it myself , and did n't see anything that shouted `` i 'm playing pok\u00e9mon go ! '',
