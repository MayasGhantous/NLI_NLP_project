  but they realised it was right . 
  you and the rest of these people wish only to subjugate others to your twisted will , against all others ' wishes , both in the republic and in the north . 
  you 're just as bad as the english conquerors of past . 
  do not pass judgement on others , when you neither understand their actions or the consequences involved . 
  true leaders like michael collins understood reality . 
  you do not . 
  these men do not fight for what you call `` national liberation '' . 
  they fight because they want someone to hate , the simplest option being the unionists . 
  they neither understand nor care for the result of their actions . 
  they care only the being able to say `` ireland is a united ireland '' by borders alone . 
  they care not for the terror they wreck on every innocent child , for the economic destruction of every associated economy , for the dreams of every young couple , for unity of peoples in every other sense . 
  in short , they care for nothing but their own bloated egos and a cause that causes nothing but despair . 
  these people would rather destroy every irish value we hold dear , the very thing that makes us who we are , to essentially bring them as low as those who conquered us before . 
  they would strive to force people to kneel against their will , to force upon others what has been forced upon their ancestors . 
  these people are not `` liberators '' . 
  they are not irish . 
  that 's a lot of parties . 
  how popular are each ? 
  also , there seem to be a few which , by your description , are pretty similar . 
  what are the deferences between said parties ? 
  and just as ireland is marked as # 10 on the world peace list . 
  :( i am ashamed of these people , and believe my fellow countrymen are too . 
  they have no place in our country . 
  huh ? 
  france , when you 're done with him , can we have him ? 
  being the main country that speaks english does not instantly make us a world player for countries . 
  if it did , i would ask where are all the companies which are relocating to ireland from the uk ? 
  why are there so many more in the usa or france that do not locate in ireland ? 
  i do n't know the exact figures , but a huge number of our population in employed by foreign firms . 
  if our tax is changed too much , or even made equal to the eu average a large number of firms will up and out because they will pay the same tax elsewhere while not needing to pay so much for travel expenses , have access to a larger market closer to production , will have access to a far larger workforce , etc. 
  while being the main english speaking country in the eu now is a nice advantage , it is but one in a situation with many variables . 
  edit : also , the uk 's decision to exit the eu is only recent ( relatively ) which means most companies have not moved yet , and also , until they move , ireland can not change policy basing off assumptions that we 'll be in a better position afterwards . 
  maybe after the uk leaves , but at current , we are not in a position to change policy , and saying we must change policy now that we will be the main english speaking country in the eu is insane . 
  oh , of course there needs to be a constant level of investment to ensure that industry stays there ( though considerably less than trying to start up a new industry ) . 
  and yes , there are huge sums of money involved , and tax competition is a big thing , with a big impact . 
  however , too many people are saying `` ireland 's a tax haven , make them stop , no matter what '' . 
  they do n't realise that ireland ca n't at the click of a finger , some of the reasons being described by / u/pampamiro above . 
  no one in ireland wants to piss everyone else off over this , but there have been no alternatives offered that would do anything other than collapse our economy . 
  until a solution is offered that does n't collapse our economy , efforts to make us change our tax will go largely dismissed . 
  again , not because we want it that way , but it 's just not viable . 
  that is my point . 
  ireland # 10 ? 
  something i can actually be proud of my country for . 
  i 'm not financial expert , but from what i understand , those big countries have a lot which allows them to stand up and keep going , even when tax rate is lowered . 
  far greater financial capital , far larger workforce , far more viable land for industry , as well as long developed industries . 
  first to come to mind is the coal industry , despite it 's current decrease and replacement , it was a huge industry in the past which allowed many countries globally to kickstart their economies , and had far longer to develop such . 
  ireland did n't have that . 
  e : also , i 'm not disagreeing with you , i just have n't read anything about decreasing tax rates elsewhere . 
  mind sourcing one ? 
  thanks . 
  i am glad to see someone from outside ireland that realises that this is n't a simple matter of ireland avoiding collecting tax to `` steal '' companies . 
  ireland has to have a low tax rate , because if it gets raised , we 'll lose those big companies , and our economy will collapse . 
  we 're entirely dependant on those big countries , despite the low tax rate . 
  absolutely nothing , according to most people . 
  just a friendly joke . 
  yeah , some people that were nazis then are still alive . 
  but the vast majority of germans now days are completely and utterly opposed to the actions of the nazis , a recent poll said a majority would not want to go to war even if a neighbouring country was invaded by russia . 
  do you think a child should get punished for the actions of their grand-parents ? 
  it 's silly to blame people for something completely unrelated to them bar where they were born . 
  and he goes silent . 
  oh , right . 
  i 'll admit , i misread your original comment . 
  regardless , if we 're staying in the eu , why should we be discussing a future outside the eu ? 
  it will only result in the rest of the eu alienating us . 
  why should we rely solely on a future with the uk ? 
   we should be negotiating with the uk for our future outside of the eu, 
   at a point , giving up privacy stops keeping you safer . 
  i wish more people understood this . 
  thoughts go out to the victims and their families . 
  80 % of the irish pop want to remain - to say that `` we '' want out is very misleading at the least . 
  oh i am certain it is already happening , even if it is illegal . 
  i am also sure they will continue to push for it , along with many of their other insane policies . 
  the linked article was just the only thing i could find in 30 second of googling . 
  no , but they almost did . 
  and they say we 're alcoholics ... 
  $ 110 million is still nothing to facebook , and knowingly lying should have serious repercussions . 
  the 1 % max fine should be increased , and greater consequences made possible in the future . 
  none the less , $ 110 million is much better than $ 150,000 !, 
  how about both ? 
  i am excite :d the witcher was an absolutely fabulous game series , i hope the netflix series lives up to it . 
  specifically i was referring to news articles , rather than all posts . 
  i would refer to posts such as [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bnlo0/eu_to_launch_legal_case_against_italy_over_fiat/ ) , [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bnar3/eu_stresses_unprecedented_unity_on_brexit_talks/ ) , [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bh38w/opinion_putin_is_not_the_geopolitical_genius_the/ ) or [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bifi4/spain_demands_uk_investigate_spike_in_xenophobic/ ) . 
  however , you have made a point that most / r/europe posts rest in the 85 + percentage , to my surprise . 
  regardless , i still do n't think that this article is being downvotes just because `` salt '' . 
  almost every post that i 've seen rests around 60-75 % , regardless of how positive it is . 
  pretty sure he 's already pissed everyone off bar putin , le pen , t_d and those who aspire to be him . 
  $ 150,000 is nothing to a company that makes $ 27.6 billion a year . 
  now only if we could get our government to get some of that common sense ... 
   600 cases of measles and over 100 with critical pulmonary complications is n't that just all the more reason to promote vaccinations ? 
  i do n't see the connection between how giving people a choice would prevent these cases ... 
  i am severely disappointed in my country in how desperately low we score on child 's rights environment and on health ( relatively ) . 
  not only that , but i do n't see anything to be done to improve it , especially when the current government is currently trying to introduce legislation to restrict the freedom of children even further . 
  our health minister has done nothing productive from what i 've seen .
