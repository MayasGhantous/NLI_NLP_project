  additionally , i would suggest expanding on the list of banned tabloids and explaining why such are banned , with evidence . 
  in addition , making it very clear what is and is not considered good journalism , worthy of being posted on / r/europe . 
  why do you want to join / r/europe 's mod team ? | to help keep the subreddit clean from irrelevant comments and posts , to encourage constructive discussion and to get experience in the matter . 
  do you think politically neutral moderation is achievable and/or desirable ? | i believe it is possible , and most definitely desirable . 
  that said , actually achieving politically neutral moderation will require active self-assessment by moderators , and i would encourage the general / r/europe community to assess our work where possible , using tools such as https://ceddit.com, 
  i did n't realise we were number 1 . 
  nice . 
  thanks , 
  ok , which one is france , and which one is the eu ?

  because it ai n't a shitpost . 
  remind me !, 
  25 years `` does the eu still exist ? '', 
  unless you can prove , with evidence that another person is lying , then do n't comment . 
  considering 3 people ( including a german ) , in 3 different posts have all said pretty much the same thing when translating , i am quite inclined to believe the translation us correct . 
  this will make a fine addition to my collection . 
  i would really like to break that gift ... 
  i mean , i could tell it was satire just from the title ... 
  i 'd invite them to come to ireland , we like our r&d here . 
  plus , i 'll need a job in a few years after i graduate , 
  / u/pingguy you must now deliver !, 
  ... they did n't vote against her just because she 's a woman ... . and i 'm pretty sure `` the majority '' of the population are n't old , white men ... 
  it is a considerably better argument than yours , which does n't exist . 
  judging from his previous comments , that is exactly what he , and many others , seem to think . 
  no , it would n't . 
  except this announcement was already agreed between the uk and ireland , and our taoiseach was the one that asked them to comment on it , to confirm that the eu would not interrupt this agreement . 
  all they did , effectively , was said yes , nothing has changed , and then officially confirmed this by vote . 
  not exactly provocative if it was already agreed by the affected parties . 
  also , they did n't announce plans , just that it would happen automatically . 
  well , the source was given , if you actually checked ... https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/68ahl0/what_we_thought_would_happen_britons_expectations/dgwxgiy/ e : also , citing a lack of a source in the op is still no reason to moan but refuse to make a real argument . 
  he can defeat all through his sheer class . 
  do ukrainians think they will be able to reclaim crimea ? 
  is there fear that more land will be taken ? 
  man , i should pay more attention to irish news . 
  2 of these things i did n't know happened . 
  while they could try , i doubt they would . 
  i believe the eu would support us against the antics of the uk , if it does n't collapse in the next few decades . 
  i 'd think he 'd be happy we 're independent and working together for the greater good . 
  maybe not completely happy , but not sad . 
  he did support the treaty afterall . 
  thank you very much !,

  n . a diplomatic agent , `` letter of september 12th from dail eireann cabinet in answer to the british cabinet 's letter of september 7th , 1921 . 
  d\u00e1il eireann met in private session at 11 a.m. on the 14th september at the mansion house , dublin . 
  the cabinet 's reply , as printed below , to the british prime minister 's letter was read and unanimously approved . 
  in view of a possible conference with representatives of the british government , the following delegation of plenipotentiaries was unanimously ratified , viz . 
  : -- arthur griffith , minister for foreign affairs ( chairman ) . 
  michael collins , minister of finance . 
  r. c. barton , minister for economic affairs . 
  eamon duggan ( deputy for meath and louth ) .

  alternatively , my history book for the junior cert said the same thing . 
  there 's also wikipedia ( which has citations ) . 
   they were elected on the basis that they would take their seats in the all-ireland d\u00e1il . 
  they then took an oath that they would support and defend the irish republic against all enemies , foreign and domestic . 
  an `` all-ireland d\u00e1il '' did not exist at the time . 
  i doubt you can speak for what others thought at the time . 
  besides , is not removing foreign military forces and creating peace on the island not exactly fulfilling their oath ? 
  ( i 'd now ask you for sources )  the d\u00e1il has no right to act in contravention of the sovereignty of the people in whose name it governs . 
  they were in breach of their own mandate and no longer had authority to act on it . 
  the idea you are thinking of is called direct democracy . 
  unfortunately , such a situation could not have occurred given the lack of infrastructure in ireland at the time . 
  in addition , those tds did have the support of the public to keep the treaty , and even by your definition , had the authority to . 
  further more , they were operating by uk law at the time - you ca n't say what they did is invalid just because you do n't like it . 
   of course not . 
  i 'm a republican ... 
  i owe my allegiance to the republic of 1916 only . 
  so you owe to a non-existent country , have no public support , who 's direct descendent is the republic of ireland . 
   `` the national territory consists of the whole island of ireland , its islands and the territorial seas . '', 
  source your claim , because i ai n't seeing it . 
   what 's the difference between the current crop and those who have gone before them ? 
  literally fucking everything bar the goal of a united ireland . 
  then again , your version is `` united by law , not by culture '' . 
  which is just a crazy , and dangerous idea . 
   it 's the flag of the republic of 1916 which was hi-jacked by the 26-county free state . 
  `` although the 1916 easter rising made the irish tricolour famous , it was actually first flown publicly in waterford city in 1848 . 
  on march 7th of that year , thomas francis meagher , a leader of the young irelanders , flew the flag from the wolfe tone confederate club at 33 the mall , waterford city . '',

   the delegates had agreed to consult with dublin prior to signing anything no , they did n't . 
  they were given the authority to sign on behalf of d\u00e1il \u00c9ireann , and that is exactly what they did . 
   which was invalid as the td 's were elected by the people to take their seats in an all ireland parliament southern irish parliament , technically . 
  they were elected to represent the interests of the irish people . 
  under uk law , they still made the decisions . 
  also under uk law , they represented the irish in the south . 
  they made a decision on what they think would be the best for the country . 
  so their decision is entirely valid . 
   the people of ireland at no time ratified the treaty . 
  i guess winning the irish civil war is n't considered ratifying it ? 
  i guess the state as it exists now means nothing to you ? 
   so in 1998 the historic and ancient irish nation became a 26 county one ? 
  1922 , not 1998 . 
  your knowledge of history is concerning . 
  the last `` kingdom of ireland '' ended in 1172 . 
  the one that exists today is , currently , a 26 county republic . 
   the constitution of the 26 county state is wholly irrelevant .
