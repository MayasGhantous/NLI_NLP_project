  i do n't remember . 
  not enough attractive women for it here . 
  does anyone think we ( `` the west '' ) would be better off just helping assad ? 
  he 's a tyrant but at least the war would end , islamic state could be eradicated and we could end the migrant crisis . 
  i 'm sure i 'm probably wrong but democracy is not going to work in syria anyway . 
  why not just prop up the only prospect of a stable syria ? 
  a lot of construction is desperately needed in and around dublin though . 
  anywhere but slovakia , lithuania , portugal , kosovo , moldova , belarus and macedonia . 
  sorry guys . 
  on our car the speedometer was mph only but it did n't really matter that much when the kph signs went up . 
  as was said above you have a feel for what the correct speeds are on certain roads . 
  he was perfectly safe in amman . 
  they 're lovely mixed with bits of bacon and pine nuts . 
  yeah they definitely are . 
  i would actually prefer to find somewhere that is about $ 20 in krakow or warsaw because it will surely be much better quality food than i could get in dublin for anything reasonable for a student . 
  ** budapest ** - rosenstein ( expensive for budapest but an absolute bargain in reality , would pay a lot more to eat there again ) ** dublin ** - bison bar ( less bang for your buck in dublin but still a great place ), 
  hungary . 
  in truth i 've only been to budapest but it really is fantastic all by itself . 
  would love to see more of the country . 
  hungarian is a very sztrange and confusing language though . 
  yeah i voted at 12 , there were a few younger people but still mostly old people . 
  those dolphins look like the ones that take over the world in the simpsons . 
   some people in the ruc had loyalist leanings understatement of the year . 
  are you seriously correcting bismarck ? 
  you know he ca n't hear you ? 
  ireland really needs a festival like this . 
  those rankings have to be biased a good bit though . 
  i find it hard to believe that american universities can be that much better than european and asian ones . 
  did he speak german or live there at all ? 
  i remember seeing him in a movie where he was a spy in hamburg but i do n't remember what language it was in . 
  what 's the german 's national sport that they get beaten at ? 
  please do n't say war ... 
  i actually could watch them with my parents when it was just a few boobs and stuff . 
  but then there was a gay scene with dick gargling noises and that was the end of it . 
  thanks for replying , do you know what kind of job you 'll get afterwards ? 
  you mentioned you were studying statistics in university . 
  what kind of topics are you currently doing in that ? 
  currently revising kriging and other crap like that and i 'm curious what get 's done in khartoum . 
  congrats on the swedish wife !, 
  living the dream . 
  ah but would you watch it with your parents ? 
   maybe we should raise welfare ftfy, 
  not surprisingly i 'm no expert on these issues so i do n't know why it was that way . 
  however , i know britain well enough and i know they would n't run things on race lines like that . 
  it 's also abundantly clear from the tone of your post that you do n't like britain which goes further to convincing me your twisting things . 
  if not then tell me why the same is n't true of the isle of man ? 
  well if you had one bad experience then fair enough . 
  i 've had the exact opposite experience every time i flew to the uk with no queues whatsoever the last time , but maybe that 's down to my irish passport or not flying to one of the most overcrowded airports in europe . 
   strangely , britain did n't take the wishes and interests of the people of hong kong quite so much to heart . 
  because it could n't defend hong kong from china anyway . 
  and all that crap about the lease . 
  by the way , the link you gave about british encroachment says that spain have since encroached on the neutral territory as well . 
  it also says `` the treaty of utrecht did not specify the extent of british sovereignty over gibraltar beyond the fortified perimeter of the town as it was in 1713 . 
  however the treaty ceded the town `` together with the port , fortifications , and forts thereunto belonging '' which included several forts along the line of the current frontier . '', 
   i 'm sure their skin colour has absolutely nothing to do with that ... 
  i do n't know what you mean by a treatment of favour , as all british overseas citizens can get a uk passport , but i 'm now certain you 're full of shit . 
  and last but not least , link an article that 's three years old and refers to non-eu passengers queuing for 9 minutes longer than expected . 
  yeah be honest you just do n't like the uk . 
  britain let hong kong go because they could n't defend it . 
  yeah but they would n't be able to come through libya if it were n't for the situation there . 
  and yeah there 's plenty of evidence to show the smugglers themselves are libyan and making huge profits from the situation at the expense of these migrants . 
  and yet the numbers of migrants are rising . 
  those few millions of euros are not going to win the libyan civil war , especially with countries like turkey propping up the opposition just as much . 
  i know , i 'm aware of what 's going on . 
  it 's been happening for months and thousands have been making the crossing every week . 
  what i meant by that is should we be giving substantial help to stop what is a humanitarian crisis ? 
  the few millions we give are of no use when they go to an ineffectual government like the libyan one , which has only tenuous control of a small portion of libya . 
  this is a european problem and the european union needs to help italy deal with this . 
  of course the only effective way to do this would be to stop the flow of migrants at their source by sending troops in to finish what was started in 2012 . 
  but as their is no appetite for military action of that kind should we at least be sending naval help ? 
  is it time for european intervention in libya to stop what is a humanitarian crisis ? 
  i 'd like to try it without borders and include cities that are n't capitals . 
  100 % in 2:28 , my computer is a slow piece of shit . 
  except with american special forces . 
  all officers should be able to communicate with those of other units and so should at least speak english and their native language . 
  enlisted soldiers only need one language . 
  all officers should speak english and french but we could have german speaking regiments and regiments that speak every other language . 
  that way you could have recruits that only speak one language but officers in every regiment would have at least two , usually more . 
  we prefer west britain . 
  well he 's a student so presumably it 's the middle of the day and everyone is at work . 
  i 'm sure it 's not that dead in the evening time . 
  ah i see , relevant username . 
  do n't we waste more money on them now because the borders have to be moved outwards ? 
  rather than the stretch between hungary and romania it will be the rest of romania 's borders . 
  well what else was it then ? 
  are you being sarcastic or is it actually good ? 
  i have no way of knowing . 
  probably the same story for scottish as well . 
  or you might say the french want to keep the germans bottled up in a nice supranational union to avoid losing to them again . 
  you might say a lot of things . 
  at the end of the day , the eu is there for the benefit of all european nationalities . 
  well one person voted for it . 
  so that leaves moldova in last on 0 . 
  why is that area so rich ? 
  the average is not included for germany or hungary . 
  it says it in the small print . 
  they look really nice and i 'd love to visit . 
  so far i 've only been to slovenia and i loved it . 
  does anyone know what would be the best way to travel around them ? 
  the rail network seems quite sparse ...
