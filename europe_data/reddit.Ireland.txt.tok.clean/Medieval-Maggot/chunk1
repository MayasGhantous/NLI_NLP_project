the protests were impressive . 
  hopefully they will force pis to be more cautious in the future . 
  interesting that the pis went so far that they pushed people who might otherwise be pro life against them . 
  well , dublin is no slouch when it comes to business . 
  weather you could call it impressive though , i do n't know . 
  most people i know do n't like it . 
  it was a real conflict that effected lives . 
  i imagine the person who came up with it thought that they were a real funny fucker . 
  thanks . 
  that does not sound good at all . 
  though it is not surprising coming from the currant polish administration . 
  what is the petition for ? 
  thanks for the responce !, 
  i am from a country ( ireland ) that never really had a single unifying native monarch . 
  so i found the idea of a monarchist political party intresting . 
  other then monarchy , what does the monarchist party of czechia beleive in ? 
  or is it a single issue party ? 
  regardless if you think it would be fair or not , its not whats going to happen . 
  bmw will lay off the workers they dont need , regardless how they voted , and there lives are going to get harder becouse of it . 
  and i have some sympathy for all of them . 
  becouse life is more complicated then `` you voted wrong , now suffer ! '', 
  so what if half of those that worked at the plant voted leave , and the other half remain ? 
  should only those that leave lose there jobs ? 
  we do n't know how the workers at the mini plant voted , and its useless to speculate . 
  all i 'm saying is that its tasteless to cheer on people losing there jobs with cute little :d face just becouse it allows you to make a political point , like the comment i replied to was doing . 
  what , oxford ? 
  70 percent of oxford voters backed remain . 
  i hate people like that . 
  bullies is all they are . 
  i think buy `` europe '' they ment the commission . 
  thats a shitty attitude to have . 
  i was against brexit , but i do n't like seeing people lose there jobs.i understand why bmw would wa n't to do this , i just feel sorry for the people it will effect . 
  there are some pundits pushing it , becouse we must follow britain in everything they do . 
  centrest he may be , but he is definatly trying to appeal to the left more then the right . 
  thats the interesting thing about idiologies . 
  what is left wing to one country is right wing to another . 
  im not downvoting you either . 
  odd . 
  thanks !, 
  are you downvoting me ? 
  i understand if you beleive i am being ignorent , but i thought we were just having a discusion . 
  if not conservative , how would you describe fillons program ? 
  but is n't fillon very socially conservative , and a thatcherite econmically ? 
  ( this was from non french sources , so it could have been misinformation ) the republican party has factions that fillon would fit right in . 
  he would not fit in the democrates , or atleast , its preasent incarnation . 
  well , the socialist did just pull a blp and elect basically a younger , less contraversial corbyn , but he is highly unlikely to win . 
  maybe a smidge further right then a blairite , but in that genreal area . 
  `` third way , niether left or right '' that sort of thing . 
  again , there might be stuff i do n't know , but i would be fairly confident on this . 
  just noticing your flair , a better comparison to make is that macron is like the right of the labour party . 
  i would have thought fillon would have fit more into the republican party . 
  he would fit right in among the establishment democrats . 
  at least , thats my impression of him . 
  a french person would be more accurate . 
  `` hey !, 
  mr. president !, 
  what 's the good word ? '', 
  so i was right !, 
  ah yes , operation diaspora is going well . 
  theres always new ireland . 
  that seems to be the case in many places . 
  nah , we will raid and colonise the welsh , like the good old days ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_dyfed#history, 
  ** miga ** , ** drain ** ** the ** ** bog ** lets build a wall and make the sasanach pay for it !, 
  i know what peasant means ( though thanks for the explanation , its a good habit to have in a subreddit where for many , english is not there first language ) . 
  i know about the bad connatations for peasants , i just wish it was seen as a more noble ( hehe ) thing . 
  becouse it was . 
  no king could have achieved shit without peasents to bulk up his levies and feed his armies . 
  i am glad that it lithuania it is seen as a title deserving of more respect . 
  why have happiness when you can have victory ? 
  is he a good mp ? 
  which is a shame , becouse thats what most of us where , if you go back far enough . 
  what constitution is this from ? 
  that is fascinating . 
  i did not know that . 
  sorry for misplacing luxenburg !, 
  interesting that they say bulette in the north east and also in the far west . 
  well , she can `` update '' my `` copyright law '' , if you know what i mean . 
  but whats the alternative ? 
  nobody doing anything ? 
  lukashenko is a dictator , and needs to go . 
  or atleast stop being a dictator . 
  lukashenko can either repress the people ( like assad ) and make things worse , or he can back off . 
  seems so far he is taking the wiser path . 
  i wish them luck . 
  maybe this is the start of something big . 
  protests are a vital part of democracy . 
  democracy is much more then voting . 
  it makes sure minority voices are hered , and allowes the poeple to let the government know that they are angry about something . 
  whats the alternative ? 
  do nothing between elections , no matter what the government does ? 
  travel bloggers . 
  my favourate people . 
  maybe . 
  still doesnt look great though . 
  had they said `` killing all the rich people '' i would have seen it as another spicy commie meme , and not said anything . 
  but old people are not the enemy . 
  many are more worse of then any of us . 
  old people = / = the rich . 
   like i 'm all for rising up , killing all the old people classy, 
  if there is anything we citizens from the rest of europe can do to help , just say so .
