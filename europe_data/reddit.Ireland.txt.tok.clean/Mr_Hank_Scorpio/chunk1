i 'm really , really , really not interested in debating terminology .

   i 'm really , really , not interested in debating terminology . 
  i was n't being precise , it was in direct response to the guy aboves comment i 'm really , really , not interested in debating terminology . 
  oh for fuck sake i am a liberal lefty and i think the whole thing was madness , take people in yes , but use some discretion for christ sake . 
  i mean , i squeeze my apples before i buy them and the biggest risk they pose is tasting mealy as fuck , but i still do it . 
  i guess what i 'm saying is we should squeeze refugees . 
  i 'll be honest i 've lost track of this metaphor . 
   quality journalism now there 's a term i 've not heard in a long time ... 
  terrible solution . 
  jail time , mostly . 
  ireland has about 13000 guards and we have a slightly smaller population than you guys . 
  i could n't imagine having half that number . 
  yeah , but we do n't like to hold a grudge, 
   i am not an economist but it seems like this irish recovery has been disproportionately experienced by the wealthiest , and driven by external factors such as the weakened currency . 
  this is my assessment as well . 
  i keep hearing about a recovery , but it 's had no effect on my pocket on the pockets of anyone i know . 
  it 's not quite breakfast and it 's not quite leaving the eu , but it comes with a cream pie at the end . 
  you do n't get completely what you would at breakfast , but you get a good meal . 
  are you kidding ? 
  my private army is busy occupying the east coast of the united states . 
  to be fair religion takes a back seat for a great many in europe . 
  i can feel myself drifting that way aswell . 
  ever so slowly , but i 'm much less tolerant of that religion than i used to be . 
   mrs merkel , who interrupted her summer holiday to hold the news conference in berlin , said the asylum seekers who had carried out the attacks had `` shamed the country that welcomed them '' . 
  she 's not mad . 
  she 's just really disappointed . 
   careful lest you cut yourself on that edge . 
  could you say anything less original to try and end the conversation . 
  ah fuck off with that . 
  it 's a cop out expression designed solely to end the conversation . 
   well ... maybe that 's not so funny , nah , that was definitely funny . 
   i do wish however europeans would be more pro israel due to their history . 
  history does n't mean we are required to agree with isreal when they are in the wrong . 
  what kind of silly philosophy is that . 
  stop the presses !, 
  isreal declares the very concept of oxygen is now antisemitic . 
  kind of proving my point man . 
  i mentioned none of these things but down we go on the antisemitic rollercoaster !, 
  news just in isreal proclaims exhaling is now also antisemitic . 
  and according to isreal breathing is antisemitic . 
  lol . 
  want to apply the same criteria to the huffpo or the guardian ? 
  all sites run stupid fluff . 
  criticising a religion is not racism . 
  is it racist to criticise christian beliefs ? 
  the sad thing is that number might well be an improvement . 
  good . 
  i was born a wanker and by god i 'll die a wanker . 
  well i giggled . 
  good jaysus !, 
  that 's terrible . 
  never been stabbed by demagoguery . 
  too glib ? 
   like how most american gun murders are between gangs , so normal people are n't too fussed unless they live in those places . 
  same in ireland really . 
  no one gives a fuck so long as they just kill each other . 
   someone died but feel free to leave your glib , simple minded jokes here . 
  indeed glib jokes are the true danger here . 
  still waiting mate ... where 's that lie ? 
   i mean you got to be able to see what i mean right ? 
  of course he sees it , but it 's devastating to his pithy little point . 
  where 's the lie ? 
  better one for ireland . 
  where you expecting a thank you from the countries that got drone bombed or something ? 
  under much less favourable terms i 'd imagine . 
  honestly though i 'd say re-entry ( if it ever happens ) is at the bare minimum a decade away . 
  it 's not about them man . 
  the point is it sends a bad message if the uk leaves and ends up with a sweet deal . 
  it may well encourage others to do the same . 
  sorry mate . 
  right , so then why bother removing the guy at the back . 
  it was obviously a patch up jib to fit the text above . 
  someone get this ~ ~ man ~ ~ person to a safe space, 
  yeah all me mates . 
  saluting all day . 
  might craic . 
  definitely . 
  sure they call dublin the eagles nest . 
  sure fuck it why does n't he just fist my kids with his nazi saluting hand . 
  maybe that 'll make me see the light . 
  yeah it 's huge in ireland . 
  sure we 're all sympathetic to a long dead germany party . 
  oh now i get it . 
  he raped all of germany with his arm . 
  thanks for walking me through it . 
  so is his arm like a dick ? 
  or is this like a mtephorical thing ? 
  jaysus you 've gone and ruined my tendies . 
  a retarded nazi . 
  is there anything worse !, 
  sorry i ca n't get more bothered about arm raising for ye . 
   are you trying to say that peoples ' actions are not indicative of their attitudes ? 
  i 'm saying the number of actual fascists is massively outnumbered by the number of people just dicking about . 
  i 'm not worried about the former as i do n't think they pose a threat anymore , despite the current rhetoric and i 'm not bothered by the latter as that is harmless . 
  so i ca n't see the fuss . 
  [ yup ] ( https://yt3.ggpht.com/-pvptj1flvh0/aaaaaaaaaai/aaaaaaaaaaa/pc4ig0jrqvm/s900-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg ), 
   trivialize something as horrible as the nazis absolutely we should . 
   when your country has a very real concern that it 's falling to fascist politics i 'm no fan of trump , but i love the hysteria from you guys .
