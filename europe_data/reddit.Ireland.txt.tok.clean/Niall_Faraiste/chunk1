the irish constitution you are talking about was created in 1937 . 
  protestantism , presbyterianism and judaism were also put into it . 
  it did guarantee freedom of religion , albeit imperfectly . 
  northern ireland was , at the latest , created in 1922 . 
   even that poor savita woman was denied an abortion that she was legally entitled to because her baby was dead and her life was under threat because some religious nurses wanted to make a point of punishing her for being a hindu and gleefully forcing her into a `` catholic death '' . 
  that was not the case . 
  a nurse would not have the power to deny such a procedure , were it legal . 
  nobody wanted to punish her , the nurse who made the `` catholic country '' remark was trying to explain the legal situation . 
  anyway , abortion law up north is pretty much on par with the republic , especially today after the pldp act . 
  anyway , if you want to troll about freedom of religion in ireland , go with the education angle . 
  that would be much more effective . 
  i 'm disappointed that the census is still calling people black irish . 
  afro-hibernian sounds much cooler . 
  when i went to paris a few years ago the pompidou centre charged eu nationals a lesser price than non-eu nationals . 
  i assumed it was formally just for french people which had been expanded to euers by community law . 
  this was n't criticism of islam as an ideology though . 
  he was bragging about harassing or at the very least saying abusive things to a woman who he says was a muslim . 
  he was targeting an assumed member of a group and saying mean things to them . 
  i do n't think that 's actually different from what racism is just because he did n't do it based on race . 
  to be clear , i 'm all for rational discussion and criticism of ideas and beliefs . 
  calling muslims towelheads is neither ; i think that 's racism , or at least something similar to racism . 
  i do n't think , based on what i have heard , that he should 've been arrested , but i do n't know the full facts of this case . 
  to go to your example , i would say that if i went up to a normal german person today and said `` explain the holocaust '' , that would be racist . 
  a random , presumably muslim looking woman in croydon does not equate to a nazi . 
  we also have galweigan for a galway person . 
  in ireland the most common slang ones would be leesider ( cork ) and dub ( dublin ) . 
  that feels like a bit of a cop-out does n't it ? 
  maybe it 's problematic to call it `` racism '' because it 's not a race , but the prejudice against a group of people is fundamentally the same . 
  sure we got the motorways last time . 
  this time i 'm thinking lunar gaeltacht . 
  modern ireland being what exactly ? 
  post 1922 , ' 37 , ' 49 ? 
  post eu accession ? 
  post divorce ? 
  post 2000 ? 
  i 'm going to assume you meant after 1922 , in which case you should have said in the history of the state , as that is normally what people talking about stats use , in my experience at least . 
  even then , i think you 'll find that there was a lot more poverty before . 
  angeles ashes style poverty used to be widespread , now it 's nearly unheard of . 
  again , with homelessness you may have a point , although i do n't think that 's a fair one . 
  most homeless people today live in far better conditions than the poor of independence era ireland did . 
  in 1986 the rate of [ consistent poverty was 16 % ] ( http://www.combatpoverty.ie/aboutus/history.htm ) . 
  in 2014 that number was [ 8 % ] ( http://www.cso.ie/en/statistics/socialconditions/surveyofincomeandlivingconditionssilcmainresults/ ) , down from 8.2 % the previous year , but up from [ 4.2 % in 2008 ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/poverty-ireland-797645-feb2013/ ) . 
  so even if you 're only counting post 2010 ireland as modern ireland , poverty , by at least one common measure , is not at the highest it has ever been . 
   in fact , iirc 1/3 of irish children right now are in danger of deprivation . 
  compared to the 1800s where thousands of irish children were starving to death because they were deprived . 
  i get things are bad , but to come out and say that the `` epic numbers of homeless , in poverty , those requiring assistance , and vulnerable are at an all time high '' is ludicrous . 
  i doubt you 'd even have to go back to the 1850s to get higher figures , except perhaps for homelessness , which is n't a fair comparison seeing as we no longer let slumlords cram people into tenements . 
  you 're thinking of waterford . 
  i thought we were calling it nu-ssr ? 
  i 'm pretty sure they ca n't but even if they could it would force ireland out . 
  the corporate tax rate is sacrosanct here . 
  it 's amazing how many people , that probably could n't tell you what the current rate of vat is , will be able to tell you what the corporate tax rate is and how great it is . 
  it would probably bring down a government if it was messed with . 
  in fairness we 've always been pretty crap for grand architecture . 
  have you ever looked at some of the plans they had for dublin on archiseek ? 
  i think they called the series `` unbuilt dublin '' . 
  some really nice ideas in it , like an [ avenue to the phoenix park from the city centre ] ( http://archiseek.com/2013/1922/ ) , with a triumphal arch for the wellington monument at the entrance to the park , or a '' [ custom house circus ] ( http://archiseek.com/2013/1922-custom-house-circus-dublin/ ) '' . 
  that 13 % works out to something like an extra 4 or 5 fatalities . 
  so a single extra bad car crash would do it . 
  i feel like meeting them would be like meeting a lad with the same shirt on as you in a nightclub . 
  [ wikipedia has a fairly comprehensive list of the features . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hiberno-english ), 
  i 'd actually argue that joining the european union is a much clearer decision than leaving the european union , as contradictory as that might sound . 
  new eu members have a pretty clear list of things that they 're supposed to do , non-eu members do n't . 
  i quite like referenda , but i really do n't think they suit british democracy very well . 
  with parliamentary sovereignty it does n't make sense . 
  [ ni 's kit is blue and green though ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?q=northern+irish+football+kit&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewidjuxmho7pahublmakhu4tcxoq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=839 ), 
  [ it 's already happening . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/translation/english/guidelines/documents/misused_english_terminology_eu_publications_en.pdf ), 
  yet they want to scrap the echr , which they 're supposed to be part of according to the gfa . 
  [ the foreign desk podcast had an episode on this . 
  ] ( https://monocle.com/radio/shows/the-foreign-desk/130/ ), 
  i 'd argue the lack of a clear vision of a post-brexit uk was anti-democratic . 
  i honestly think we should select some fancy sounding latin names for all eu institutions , and use them in every language . 
  it would remove a lot of confusion , especially between the coe and eu institutions . 
  but unworkable to unionists . 
  it 's been suggested before and they had a hissy fit . 
  if you do n't have freedom of movement you ca n't have single market access . 
  if you do n't have single market acess you need a customs border . 
  that 's not scaremongering . 
  granted , maybe britain can somehow get special treatment . 
  i hope they do n't . 
  that would be anti-european and make a mockery of the idea of the eu . 
  it would also probably require some large concession from britain , which i would argue is again anti-democratic ( 350 million to the nhs anyone ? ), 
  i understand that freedom of movement is not the same as border checks . 
  the problem from an irish point of view is that the average british person does n't care about the irish border . 
  i believe may herself has previously called for irish sea border , to combat terrorism . 
  there 's no love for the cta from london . 
  a brexit that achieves the aims of the leave camp would mean ( at least ) a customs border . 
  i would argue that not suspending freedom of movement and adherance to eu laws is just as antidemocratic as not engaging article 50 at all . 
  problem being , that 's not her decision , and she does n't have a democratic mandate to stop it . 
  if she has to choose between enacting brexit and a border , she has a mandate for brexit . 
  she has nothing to back up choosing no border over that , besides the obvious issues around a border and impracticality of it . 
  anyone who thinks a border could be put in should take a look at the border on google maps . 
  in english at least . 
  wales is little britain in scots gaelic and irish . 
  not under the gfa at least , it 's all or nothing . 
  there 's very good reasons to avoid repartition though . 
  it would probably lead to violence , possibly some ethnic cleansing . 
  a heavily unionist majority state would need strong protections to avoid regressing back to what it was before the civil rights movement .
