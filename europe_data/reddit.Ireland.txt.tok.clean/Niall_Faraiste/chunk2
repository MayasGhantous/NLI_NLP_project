  from a nationalist perspective we might never get it all back if we took a lot of the nationalist majority areas . 
  no but plenty of political steps have been . 
  we have a history of using rather understated terms for our historical events . 
  world war two was ( and still is by some people ) called ** `` the emergency '' ** . 
  we also had ** `` the great hunger '' ** ( the famine , halved the population ) or ** `` night of the big wind '' ** ( worst storm to ever hit us ) . 
  sorry to nitpick , but you should 've used emigration there , not immigration . 
  because the people would be leaving turkey , not coming there , at least in the context you 're talking about . 
  well they 're requirements the exist for a country to join erm ii ( at least , that 's my understanding of how they do it , i have n't studied this area in much depth ) . 
  so by changing the requirements , or possibly developing some way to punish nations which intentionally avoid meeting those requirements , one would deal with the problem . 
  grey 's status in the uk or even the eu wont be affected by brexit , as he holds an irish passport . 
  his grandmother was irish i believe . 
  ireland allows anyone with an irish grandparent or parent to gain citizenship without any residency requirements or tests or anything . 
  due to our `` shared history '' with the united kingdom , an irish citizen has pretty much the same rights as a british citizen in the uk , greater even than other eu citizens would have . 
  under uk law , ireland is n't even considered a `` foreign country '' . 
  so no matter what might hypothetically happen with brexit and foreign citizens in the uk , grey is safe , unlike a lot of european citizens , who do have some cause for concern . 
  it is unlikely the uk will try and do anything to them , certainly not in the short term , but down the line there may be pressures on them , say to get british citizenship or move away . 
  nothing , but i 'd say those technical abuses will be got rid of in 20 years time . 
  i was talking about the euro here and sweden . 
  also countries were always allowed reintroduce temporary checks , even within schengen . 
  they 're still in schengen . 
  it 's not an abuse or misapplication of the rules . 
  those countries are the exceptions , and generally have opt-outs because they joined before the projects were part of being in the eu or because they exploit technical loopholes to stay outside it . 
  a new nation joining the eu generally has to agree to everything . 
  grey lives in the uk on an irish passport . 
  he does n't have to pick a side . 
  twenty years down the road they then decide to rejoin the eu to get representation and get none of their original opt-outs . 
  the uk joins schengen and the euro in 2038 . 
  get deal , put deal to a referendum . 
  when the british public reject it , either because it will be economically ruinous , or because it achieves none of them aims of brexit , call an election , let new government deal with it . 
  hopefully new government will get in on a platform of no brexit and everything goes back to normal . 
  ah here , things have definitely picked up . 
  unemployment is down , there 's more building going on , help wanted signs are n't attracting round the block queues , there 's much fewer empty retail units in towns , and those that are there are being sold or have to let signs up , which is nice to see . 
  are things perfect ? 
  hell no , but we can be a little more optimistic now . 
  [ the plan is still to sell it . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/business/commercial-property/central-bank-to-sell-landmark-dame-street-hq-1.2024921 ) what will go in there though , god only knows . 
  it 's kind of odd really , having a massive office building in the middle of a night life and culture hub . 
  we are talking about some things , like [ monard near cork city ] ( http://www.eveningecho.ie/cork-news/green-light-given-new-cork-town-monard/2250553/ ) and a special development zone ( sdz , easier planning process ) on the poolbeg peninsula in dublin . 
  there has n't really been anything much done . 
  there 's been some ( imho , rather shitty ) suggestions of using `` modular housing '' to cope with the student accommodation crisis . 
  my problem with it ( even as a student ) is that of all the housing crisis the student crisis should be rather quick to solve , a few big developments , maybe even one or two in cork and four plus in dublin could solve the issue much more conclusively then a few prefabs . 
  if they were university or college owned , like trinity hall in dublin or victoria lodge in cork then they should be fundable from central government funds . 
  my other issue is that it was suggested as a way of helping ease the overall crisis . 
  i do n't think it 's an efficient way of doing that . 
  much of the pent up demand is young professionals and young families . 
  student housing is generally not suitable for such people , it lacks parking , access to schools , is often of a poor quality and is rather expensive for what one gets . 
  people moved into them . 
  also a lot of them are n't in very convenient places . 
  like , rural areas with no infrastructure or services inconvenient . 
  the housing shortage has been caused by massive underdevelopment for the last few years . 
  i think at one stage they were saying we needed to be building 44,000 units a year based on population growth , at the time we were building 9,000 . 
  first past the post single member constituencies do n't leave to nice results . 
  or bushing . 
  are they not somewhat doing it to puerto rico ? 
  i remember my grandmother giving out , saying that teaghlach was politically correct , as it means household and so includes more modern families , while clann has a more nuclear family definition . 
  which funnily enough is green . 
  it 's there under government , which the commission pretty much is . 
   the commission should be reformed and re-named as the cabinet . 
  eu institutions use cabinet ( pronounced the french way cab-in-ay ) for staff in the offices of officials though . 
  like a judge in the ecj has a cabinet , same for a commissioner . 
  yeah , when it was originally being used in the very narrow sense of those fake macedonian sites and websites that were trying to copy big name news sites it mad sense , but just because a piece is wrong ( or mistaken ) or horrifically slanted in one direction or the other does n't , or at least in my view should n't , mean it 's `` fake news '' . 
  * de-gaelisiced , we 're not french . 
  the irish state is n't nearly as gaelic as many people would like ( it 's arguably getting less so , iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann started calling itself irish rail a few years ago ) , and the few bits that are probably wo n't change . 
  i think most people assume certain things will change . 
  the national anthem is a common one , the flag another . 
  i ca n't see the garda\u00ed being renamed . 
  i would imagine that the psni would carry on for a good while , seeing as they carry guns regularly which the garda\u00ed obviously do not , growing as they did out of the civil war and being a reaction to british police forces that were unpopular by independence and were armed . 
  by the time the forces were merged i think concerns over language would seem petty . 
  i feel like the derry/londonderry issue will be a bigger fight than the name of the garda\u00ed . 
  there 's oo marches in the republic already . 
  the trouble around them will probably remain up north , although eventually one would assume the psni will be rolled into an garda s\u00edochana , so that might affect perceptions . 
  the issues around the irish langauge might cause some problems . 
  i ca n't see ireland dropping bilingualism , so assuming the dup has still refused to enact an irish language act you might see issues there with bilingual signage . 
  to be honest , i imagine a lot of concerns will be addressed slowly , possibly with ni existing in a state of transition as a sort of condominium for a few years . 
  honestly if i was english the level of joke/sarcastic ira support you find among irish people would be quite scary . 
  it 's kicked up a bit in recent years with the facebook meme pages growing , but it 's been there a long time . 
  beyond all that , it 's also serving as a good learning aid as to what being in the eu actually means . 
  i think the point he is making is that the top american universities are smaller , highly selective colleges , while the top aussie ones are larger and easier to get into . 
  we should just all adopt the latin names for them . 
  it would help prevent confusion and sound way cooler . 
  you ca n't realistically cater to a fickle public at every turn . 
  if 6 months after brexit ii there 's some european crisis and 52 % say they want to leave again , must a new referendum be held ? 
  a vote based on the terms of the final deal might make sense , but the supposedly considered opinion that the public gives in a referendum must be held to be a better measure of the public will than the whims of a representative sample in opinion polls . 
  i think referendums can be very useful , especially in more moral or nation defining things ( abortion , human rights , major changes of law ) , where relying on representatives can make matters complicated by conflating several issues together . 
  they 're also good when you have clear , binary and even somewhat legalistic options . 
  where there is a clear understanding of what a yes or no means . 
  obviously , brexit did n't have this . 
  if remain had won it would probably have been pointed to as a mandate for at least the status quo , if not more integration , even if british people still wanted less integration but something short of leaving . 
  leave , as we have seen , is a complete clusterfuck of a poorly understood and defined spectrum of options that few representatives seem to understand , never mind the public . 
  personally , i think a referendum on the final deal would n't be unreasonable , but a referendum because `` opinion polls show people have changed their mind '' ? 
  that would lead to far too unstable a process . 
  funnily enough when mandela died there were threads showing loyalist and british nationalist facebook groups comparing mandela to the ira , gerry adams and martin mcguiness . 
  i 'll be honest , i 've never heard of a church being used , but plenty of religious schools and parish centres are . 
  i vote in the parish centre of the local church of ireland congregation . 
  miller was the brexit article 50 case . 
  the devolved governments intervened , arguing that they would also need to be consulted . 
  the supreme court of the united kingdom disagreed . 
  the argument was put forward that the good friday agreement , and thus the devolved structure had a certain constitutional status and that that meant that consent was required , but they said no . 
  yep , london takes over . 
  bear in mind , northern ireland is not a federal state , but a devolved region .
