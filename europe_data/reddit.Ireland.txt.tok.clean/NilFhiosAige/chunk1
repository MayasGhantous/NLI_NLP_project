the result will leave the parties of the left to ponder how they can respond to immigration and security challenges , without abandoning their traditional values . 
  similarly , the mainstream right will be seeking to reclaim ownership of the law and order narrative . 
  an issue that crops up every few years when both countries ( and denmark ) are feeling particularly bored , or silly . 
  when the fn first became a meaningful force in the ' 80 's , they won support in communist strongholds ( nord , provence ) , so perhaps no surprise to see a reversal . 
  and equally , i do n't want to offend you in my reply , but net immigration to ireland actually fell in the last five years , so freedom of movement will only attract people when an economy is growing , or another is comparatively worse , as the spanish and italian stats show . 
  the eastern european peak appears to have passed , and as their national infrastructures develop , the pace of return to their homelands will only increase . 
  in any case , almost all who are currently resident have integrated into local communities , with no anti-immigration backlash to date . 
  the title should , of course , read 2016 census . 
  les republicains have gone in that direction over the last decade . 
  [ and relax ] ( http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2017/04/05/97001-20170405filwww00338-presidentielle-les-ecarts-se-resserrent-dans-un-sondage.php ) !, 
  i hope you 're right - just given macron 's relative inexperience and the comparative weakness of en marche 's constituency machine , i 'm worried about whether he has staying power . 
  which is probably an underestimate if one makes allowances for `` shy fn '' voters . 
  essentially , the article highlights how 96 % of gibraltarians voted to remain , with the territory 's government campaigning for a special eu status . 
  after the rock unexpectedly apoeared in the eu 's brexit guidelines , catalan meps proposed a vote in the european parliament in support of gibraltar self-determination in the course of the general debate on negotiating terms . 
  that was defeated , but forms part of the proxy war between barcelona and madrid . 
  a finnish blogger 's take on the [ stats ] ( https://cataloniaindependenceblog.wordpress.com/2017/03/30/unilateral-independence-referendum-will-be-a-success/ ), 
  yes , both are correct , as the stat in the op relates to an indyref negotiated with madrid , whereas yours is what would occur if the vote goes ahead regardless ( as seems likely now ) . 
  the major problem i see is that if the catalan government goes ahead with the unilateral referendum in september , it would pass due to unionist abstentions , but they would then be outside the eu because they would be leaving an existing member . 
  unlike scotland , catalonia is one of the wealthiest spanish regions , but the european factor may well be the strongest unionist argument . 
  balkan/western balkan eliminates any political bias . 
  similar to the reaction to the ira campaign in the republic . 
  still , the reaction from the spanish posters suggests the peace process there will prove much slower than that in ni - bildu may be `` soft '' ( to put it mildly ) in relation to eta , but better for them to play an exclusively political role . 
  presumably , they 're inferring national seat projections from the results reported to date . 
  and the live counter naturally changes dramatically . 
  see saltire blue 's post . 
  ireland : the remains of 800 children were found in an orphanage in tuam , county galway , as the climax of an on-going investigation by a local historian , further discrediting the irish catholic church . 
  meanwhile , the northern irish assembly election surprisingly resulted in a virtual tie between unionists and nationalists , increasing the likelihood of a referendum on irish unity within 10-15 years . 
  interestingly , le monde reports that hamon backs a move to pr , as would le pen for obvious reasons , so only a fillon presidency would prevent the change coming into force . 
  one suspects so - macron 's as yet embryonic en marche would best be described as social liberal , similar to modem , but given that bayrou 's party is virtually extinct - em gives french liberalism a tremendous opportunity to grow back to udf-era proportions , particularly by cultivating votes from socialists and greens . 
  this is the consequence of a controversy involving the garda\u00ed , where taoiseach enda kenny gave a weak d\u00e1il performance . 
  now , two prominent ministers from his fine gael party have effectively launched leadership campaigns , calling on the taoiseach to announce his departure date . 
  i would worry that we continue to make the same mistakes as during the boom - the economy remains overly dependent on multinationals for growth , and little has been done politically to prevent repeated over-heating of property markets . 
  seems low for die gr\u00fcne , compared to previous polls - they and die linke would be most squeezed by an spd revival . 
  the [ polling data ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_french_presidential_election%2c_2017 ) certainly suggests a three-way tussle for the runoff . 
  fifth republic system being presidential-based , french parties tend to spring up around strong leaders : various gaullist parties changing names according to the wishes of successors , mitterrand welded the socialists into one party , giscard d'estaing established the udf . 
  generally , the presidential winner calls the assembly elections a month after his/her own win , so socialists could well defect to en marche * en masse * within that timeframe !, 
  all that 's really known about him in ireland is that he favours universal basic income and the legalisation of cannabis . 
  in terms of his chances , the polls suggest that he would finish fifth , even behind m\u00e8lenchon ( communist , even though not a member of the communists ) . 
  if the moderate socialists switch to macron , he could make the runoff , given fillon 's recent scandal . 
  crown dependency , rather than an integral part of the uk . 
  on the 21st of january , 1919 , the newly-elected sinn f\u00e9in mps assembled at the mansion house , dublin as the first d\u00e1il , at which point ireland became a * de facto * independent state , even if not recognised as such until the anglo-irish treaty two years later . 
  on the same day , two policeman were shot dead in tipperary , commencing the war of independence , which continued until a truce in july 1921 . 
  mostly about addressing concerns with the border , travel between the countries and residency rules . 
  once these are sorted , the eu figure will be even higher . 
  the pro-european stance of the population and political parties was a major driver in the successful push for independence from serbia , as the latter traditionally orientated towards moscow . 
  that said , accession talks are still at an early stage , so probably another decade before they 'll ultimately gain membership.com, 
  there has been an historical tradition in france of leaders essentially creating new parties in their likeness - see the various incarnations of the gaullists , d'estaing 's old udf party , bayrou 's modem and mitterrand uniting the left into the ps , so en marche would n't be unprecedented . 
  60 % of irish second-level students study french , as historically it was seen as the european language to learn , and it has been on the curriculum here since the british era . 
  they got some reassurances , and the results seem above board : socialists 51 % democrats 29 % lsi 15 % http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/socialists-win-another-term-in-albania-elections-06-26-2017, 
  initial turnout indications are a mere 43 % , according to [ balkan insight ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/live-albanian-general-elections-2017-06-22-2017 ) . 
  in fairness , the irish constitution dates from 1937 , which explains the preamble . 
  one presumes the bilateral citizenship arrangement between ireland and the uk would be unaffected , but the article does n't clarify this . 
  indeed , my town in kerry ( sw ireland ) is right on the cusp of the 10 p.m. zone , as it suggests . 
  of course , modem struggled to elect anyone to previous assemblies , latched onto en marche as an electoral flag of convenience , and have jumped ship now that the value of the coalition has been maximised . 
  purely tactical , or is support for independence genuinely on the rise ? 
  phillipot , the fn machiavelli , has lost his assembly seat . 
  difficult to see how the soft border with ireland is maintained in such a circumstance . 
  there will be whatever can pass the hoc in two years time - we 've seen from the major era that seat torals can erode very quickly , so final deal will require cross-party consensus . 
  agreed , largely vote centre-left myself also . 
  i do feel , however , that coveney seems the most suitable candidate for both restoring stormint and maintaining relations with both london and brussels . 
  they 're the world 's largest manufacturer of false teeth . 
  because it was transparent electioneering ? 
  fg has both a conservative and social democratic wing , and to win an election , they need to satisfy both camps , as irish voters tend to frown on ideological motivations . 
  basically , he 's an irish tory - he recently launched a campaign to clamp down on welfare fraud , and stated he wished to represent those `` who get up early in the morning '' - in other words , code for moves against the disadvantaged and unemployed . 
  notable that the grassroots membership picked his rival by an almost two-to-one margin , but varadkar won heavily in the parliamentary bloc of the electoral college . 
  el pais is a madrid-based newspaper , so hardly an unbiased source , would be interesting to see what the catalan press make of these allegations . 
  and to further clarify , 27 % want ireland to leave if the uk gets a bad deal , compared to 71 % committed to the eu regardless . 
  it underlines that m\u00e9lenchon and hamon need a united left list , as occurred in the seventies and eighties , and that such a front could become the main opposition . 
  reportedly first settled by irish monks , certainly visited by irish fishermen in currachs before the norse . 
  oldest parliament in the world , icelandic largely unchanged from old norse , so islanders can read sagas in the original . 
  jules verne 's journey to the centre of the earth has runic script in the beginning , think they also enter through hekla ? 
  phone books list by christian name because of the patrinomic/matrinomic surnames . 
  the article is a potted biography - detailing the assemblyman 's background in france 's famous ( infamous ? ), 
  ena finishing school , an early allegiance to the socialists and former pm michel rocard , before switching to the ump ( now les r\u00e9publicains ) and becoming a friend of alain jupp\u00e9 . 
  certainly , such a choice would help macron woo centre-right voters ahead of the assembly elections . 
  seems that die linke falling below 5 % gives cdu and fdp a majority : https://mobile.twitter.com/europeelects/status/863808332913680384, 
  if hofer had won either the presidency or a ge last year , brussels would have started panicking , though . 
  the conservative peoples ' party want to take on the freedom party in relation to immigration , but as the latter party [ endorsed ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-austria-politics-fpo-iduskbn17r232 ) both the euro and the eu earlier this year , austria 's position within the bloc is no longer in question . 
  a more practical step would be to have the commission president directly elected across the eu , to remove the `` unelected bureaucrat '' charge , and increase accountability . 
  800 [ british jews ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/03/british-jews-german-passports-review-great-british-menu ) have applied since brexit . 
  macron 's movement had earlier declared that the former pm `` does n't meet the criteria '' to become an assembly member , as he was n't a member , and they did n't want to simply `` recycle '' current politicians . 
  now , the socialists will launch an internal procedure that could ultimately expel valls from the party .

  see above , two separate questions . 
  we 've always been pro-eu anyway , but generally we tend to share the swedish , finnish and austrian attitudes to defence , which is why ireland never joined nato .
