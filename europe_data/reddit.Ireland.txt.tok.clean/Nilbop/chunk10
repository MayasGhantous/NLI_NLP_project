  yet so far nato 's placid political masters show no sign of willingness to forestall the looming disaster . 
  considering you are making an analog decision between choice a or choice b there 's a limit to the benefits experience can bring versus the benefits of engaging a larger electorate for all future elections . 
  what does this have to do with this guy wearing a murdered family 's clothes ? 
  there 's damn all difference between 16 , 18 or 21 . 
  the import differentiator is your given experience at this point , not your age . 
  i 'm in favour of this if it gets more people interested in voting , which should always be the goal of every party . 
  if you can convince people early on that their vote * means * something then they 'll remember that for the rest of their lives . 
  as it is kids get driving lessons , they get sex ed , but at no point do they get a legitimate sit-down talk about how important it is for them to vote . 
  some people assume whenever you see a name in the headlines it will always be about the same topic it used to be about . 
  i think regardless of what it * currently * says about us it would be naive to think that the policy does n't warrant review , especially with the burden placed on the `` frontline '' nations like spain and italy . 
  it 's interesting primarily because of who is making this accusation . 
  [ kudrin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexei_kudrin ) was by most accounts an excellent finance minister who helped russia pay off much of the debt it had accumulated after the fall of the soviet union and was instrumental in russia coming out of the credit crunch relatively unscathed . 
  however , he did n't part on good terms with the government and is a noted liberal , so i would n't be surprised to see him tarred and feathered in the media because of this . 
  ah , thanks . 
  these kurds are mostly coming into the highly kurdish territories along turkey 's south-eastern border region , so it should n't really have much of an effect demographic wise . 
  economically and as far as infrastructure is concerned , it 's going to be a real test . 
  is this a reliable source ? 
  i do n't doubt that poland might actually do this , but this seems kinda sketchy . 
   i think most british do n't see their german ancestry . 
  like the windsors ? 
  yes , damn the point of this union , let 's take this opportunity to grandstand and hang our neighbours . 
   will this imbalance become greater if britain leaves the uk ? 
  it 'll be even worse if schengen leaves the eurozone . 
  you ca n't fit that into a headline , johnny levelhead . 
  i seriously ca n't tell if you 're joking . 
  the website you are trying to access has been blocked . 
  you negligent monster . 
  this looks amazing . 
  i do n't know why you are taking this as though it were a personal insult when i 'm telling you it 's a documented phenomenon . 
  oh look , someone 's alt account . 
  this is not a new phenomenon ; it 's called paris syndrome and it 's well documented , although previously i 've heard it in referrence to [ japanese people who travel to paris with idealized view of a western city in mind ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_syndrome ) , and instead find * les lascars * . 
  i think you 're vastly overestimating the stagnation of the global political climate . 
  do n't fool yourself kaisermatias ; if a welshman could do it he 'd destroy you and everyone you cared about . 
  my impression was that , outside of the snp faithful , he is/was a rather unpopular figure in scotland anyway . 
  the relatively large support for the yes movement was in spite of him , not because of him , was my understanding . 
  i 'm smothering in the fucking irony here .

  obviously , neither are remotely likely .

  hold on , * lublin * city ? 
  seriously ? 
  it is n't ? 
  what is it then ? 
  the first thing that strikes me is i do n't believe for a second that cameron has the sense of integrity to resign on friday . 
  he will be in that office until they drag him kicking and screaming from it . 
  the article is actually probably correct on this one . 
  in the event that the yes vote passes and scotland moves forward with independance the likeliest outcome is the use of the median line to respect maritime borders ; i.e the line used pre-1999 ( when blair foresaw future issues with the policy and attempted to amend it ) to determine the boundaries between scotland and england for fisheries , in part because the united nations convention on the law of the sea would back this reasoning up ( and is part of the reason why blair sought to change the borders ) . 
  this gives scotland control of somewhere in the region of 90 % of the uk 's current oil and gas reserves . 
  now this is obviously a * huge * issue for both sides ; it would be an enormous windfall for scotland and cause huge headaches for many current uk companies operating in the area if an ecnomic union between the two states is n't reached . 
  that being said whether england would go so happily along with the process of independance if such a huge segment of it 's energy market were to dissappear is , in my opinion , a serious test of their government 's character . 
   but the english might just requisition it until the scots have paid the expenses the english incur as a result of scottish secession . 
  this is pure nonsense . 
  i love the media 's belief that they can shock people that citizens from * your country * are fighting for isis . 
  yes , thank you , we are aware that there are crazies from every state leaving their homes to fight in this ludicrous conflict , you are n't surprising anyone . 
  what ? 
  you mean the private sector is n't rewarding employees proportionate to their success ? 
  it 's the daily mail mate . 
  you 'd have better luck divining * actual * news from sheep entrails . 
  dude at least your national menu does n't consist * entirely * of colcannon , stew , and an ulster fry . 
  i 'm really more of the mind that it 's the chef and what he does though ; i 'm not sure if the stuff that heston blumenthal comes out with traditionally counts as british cuisine , but that 's definitely what it is , and that shit is * godlike . 
  * so with that in mind , i 'm going to say ... danish . 
  in norwegian this actually means `` the bart , the . '', 
   my last reply here due to retarded rule of waiting for 10 min between replys . 
  i 've had the same problem . 
  talk to a mod , they managed to do something for me , no idea what it was though . 
   sure , if you want to dumb down geopolitics into extreme . 
  when you have an army literally taking over a country that tends to push all other factors out of the spotlight for the time being . 
  that 's before we get into the absurd arguement that a sovereign nation can not join the eu because it 's larger neighbour will invade . 
  yup , that 's about what i thought it 'd be . 
  thanks . 
  i ca n't imagine they literally used the phrase `` bomb romania '' , did they ? 
  this site is n't working over here in moose country . 
  can anyone give me a quick top 10 ? 
   however , the pact will not be implemented until the end of 2015 due to protests from russia , a country that also has a free trade agreement with ukraine but does not have one with the eu . 
  russian officials fear that the russian market would be flooded with goods from the eu , and have attempted to insert amendments to the agreement that would prevent this . 
  an interesting point . 
  you can attempt to frame this however you like , the facts are simple : 1 . 
  russia invaded and continues to occupy ukraine . 
  russia invaded and continues to occupy ukraine under the auspices of protect native-russians and russian interests . 
  that 's as simple as it gets . 
  yeah i was n't actually agreeing it , i 'm framing it in context . 
  no outside force should be able to dictate sovereign policies . 
  if nothing else it 's putting the agenda in the spotlight for someone new . 
  seems reasonable . 
  i mean if i can put aside the fact that putin has shown he will invade another country to protect a russian minority and he 's asking to dictate the affairs of another state , that is . 
  it 's like swimming against a current of warm treacle . 
  the catholic/nationalist bits vote sinn feinn and the protestant/unionist bits vote dup . 
  this roughly correlates to the south/southwest and north/northeast respectively , with belfast being split in the same fashion . 
  in some ways , norn iron is incredibly easy to understand . 
  yeah , try posting this in / r/russia for a crushing dose of head-burying and wilfull ignorance . 
  rockall .
