  why do the brits think iceland is las vegas ? 
  they are right about us being a bunch of rascals , though . 
  because this is a story about a town in south yorkshire with nothing to do with your obsession of muslims in london , and frankly your opinions are shallow and repellent . 
   yes scotland has a bigger bargaining chip , but that does n't give it an unlimited ability to demand things . 
  and on what world is * that * happening ? 
  you have no idea where rotherham is , do you . 
  you would n't know this from all the stern , fatherly `` there 'll be no going back , scotland ! '', 
  from cameron . 
   the reason they invaded ukraine is that they - rightly - believed that they could more or less get away with it . 
  attacking an eu state would mean starting a full scale war against the west , and there 's absolutely nothing they stand to gain in that scenario . 
  unless they believe they can get away with it . 
  will we defend finland ? 
  will we defend estonia ? 
  or will we just impose sanctions ? 
  i 'd like to think we 'd defend our own and our interests , but our response to ukraine is proving me wrong everyday . 
  how do you pronounce `` brz '' and `` czi '' then ? 
  if the pope asked me for a kit-kat i 'd give him the finger . 
  this was every day with this guy , and the party he left behind is currently running norn iron . 
  there are ** nine ** consecutive consonants in that name . 
  you people are sadistic . 
  james may is spinning in his spaniel haircut . 
   so , russia must admit that it basically has lost what it considers as its own backyard or `` sphere of influence '' , pay the reparations + quietly roll over and die to its western overlords ? 
  are you a big fan of treaty of versailles by chance ? 
  okay two points : 1 . 
  you asked me `` why is everyone so sure this would end if russia agreed to demands ? '', 
  i told you why ; because the eu are setting the sanctions and they have stated repeatedly that they will lift them if russia accedes . 
  was that question in bad faith ? 
  because now you are talking about imperialism . 
  russia does not have any right to dictate terms to ukraine . 
  ukraine is a sovereign european nation bordering the eu and is perfectly within it 's rights to seek closer ties with brussels . 
  there are obvious reasons for why it would do this : 1 . 
  the eu 's economy is strong and varied and opens up avenues for investment in ukraine and for ukrainian businesses to act within the eu free trade zone . 
  the eu has a history on transparency of law and respect for human rights . 
  russia has shown a willingness to impose it 's will on what it views as it 's `` backyard '' , which it can not do to members of the eu without reprecussion . 
  why would ukraine not seek to pursue the self-determination and economy-building that the eu allows ? 
  look at the examples of russia , whose economy is moribund and shored up by the energy market it uses to exert political will ( and thus minimize private-sector profits ) with a history of corruption and human rights violations , and poland , whose economy has blossomed in the eu , whose international standing has only grown and has seen it 's governmental accountability and justice systems improve ? 
  the eu simply offers more freedom and more possibility for growth and getting out of russia 's `` backyard '' as you call it . 
  why would any nation choose to be under moscow 's hegemony ? 
  it does n't make sense . 
  i 'm sure it does for * moscow * , but moscow does n't rule ukraine , or poland , or estonia . 
  i want to focus on a few things you said that rubbed me the wrong way :  pay the reparations if one country invades another and helps destroy parts of it then they should be expected to pay reparations . 
  it happened in world war 2 . 
  it happened to the usa in iraq and afghanistan , costing their economy billions and billions of dollars . 
  why * should n't * russia pay for invading ? 
  it makes no sense . 
   quietly roll over and die to its western overlords let me put this in context for you ; russia is being asked to pull it 's army out of a peaceful country that it has invaded and stop backing the insurgency that is costing the citizens of that country their lives , and you are telling me this is asking russia to roll over and die ? 
  the eu is not asking for billions of euros and priceless artifacts it can take back and house in the louvre and the royal gallery ; it is asking russia to be reasonable and to respect the sovereignty of it 's neighbour . 
   are you a big fan of treaty of versailles by chance i 'm going to give you a chance to explain yourself about this . 
   on a side note , how would you describe the role of turkey in syrian crisis ( and other gulf states ) ? 
  i 'm not following the syrian crisis so i do n't feel knowledgeable enough to talk about it . 
  you can check my post history if you like , it 's simply not something i 'm currently interested in . 
   but i do wonder why is that european officials has repeatedly traveled to maidan to participate in protests against elected democratically government and did nothing for turkish protests ? 
  i 'm sorry , what officials are you talking about ? 
  i 'm not denying they went there , if any did , i just ca n't think of any off the top of my head . 
  i will say that relations with turkey have been extremely cool for a long time with several member states strongly opposed to including them in the eu , so i 'm not sure why you would expect eu involvement in turkish protests . 
  the eu is simply not interested in including turkey on certain levels . 
   i am by no means a pro-russian poster , what i am trying to advocate is a bit of restrain in eagerness to `` punish evil russia '' . 
  usually , tunnel visioning something is bad and while i do think that europe will not lift sanctions out of nowhere , until conflict is over , the idea that russia itself will stop unless it will be grated a somewhat desirable/acceptable outcome is naive . 
  there is absolutely nothing wrong with being pro-russian ; russian is a wonderful country with an incredible history and a stoic people that have contributed many things to the world that they can be eminently proud of . 
  furthermore , i have no problem with talking to someone who supports russia 's recent actions in ukraine as long as they can reasonably defend their opinions . 
  with that in mind : 1 . there is no policy of `` punishing evil russia '' ; russia is being sanctioned because it is an aggressor state that has invaded a peaceful neighbour , continues to occupy it , wages a propaganda war against it ( and the eu and us at large on this issue ) and has backed and continues to back an armed insurgency within the country 's borders . 
  there is no attitude of sanctioning russia just because it is * russia * , these sanctions are in place because the putin adminstration broke international law and continues to violate them . 
  as i 've said earlier i will repeat now ; the eu has been more than accomodating to russia . 
  the slow-burn attitude towards sanctions has angered many citizens who wish a swift end to the invasion of ukraine , but several leaders , chiefly merkel , have been extremely concerned with the effects on russian trade and impacts on the russian economy as a whole . 
  to repeat myself : cameron has come out today and said these sanctions can be lifted within the month if russia is seen to be accomdating a peaceful resolution to the ukrainian conflict . 
  the idea that russia be offered a reward in order to convince it to cease it 's actions is ** absolutely absurd . 
  ** let me put this into perspective : russia has invaded a peaceful nation , annexed part of it , fomented a rebellion in another and by many reports mounted an armed invasion which it insists to the world does not exist . 
  the sheer ** audacity ** of saying russia must be * rewarded * for it 's actions before it will stop is * mind-boggling * to me . 
  russia decided on it 's own to invade a country that posed no threat to it or it 's holdings . 
  it sought no diplomatic solution . 
  the only outcome that is reasonable to any impartial bystander is the return of ukraine 's sovereign land to it , russia pulling it 's forces out of ukraine , and ceasing to back the rebellion . 
  ** that is not asking a lot from russia . 
  ** the idea that it would ask the eu to disregard it 's own interests in the region and moreso * reward * it for it 's actions is so far estranged from reality that i 'm shocked you can even ask that of me . 
   tl ; dr to yours - ukraine is in western sphere of influence now , russia can go fuck itself and can not protect its national interests/backyard because it is too weak . 
  i have been polite to you about this and argued in good faith while backing up reasoning as logically and reasonably as i can while seeking not to offend your sensibilities . 
  if you continue to be snide to me , that wo n't happen again . 
  now , to deal with your final point , as impolitely as you phrased it : there is no reason for ukraine not to seek closer ties with the eu . 
  there is no reason for the eu to stop ukraine doing this . 
  russia openly invaded ukraine and continues to occupy and attack it . 
  there is * no going back to russian hegemony for ukraine . 
  * you can not expect a nation to agree to be on good terms with you again after you 've killed it 's people and taken it 's land for your own , and i say that as an irishman who grew up as part of the united kingdom . 
  we live in a stable , prosperous and mostly lawful part of the world and you can not deny a nation the right to self-determination just because what they determined displeases you . 
   in a game of civ when you go to war with another country with which you have a trading agreement , you immediately loose the resources you were trading with thus penalty is immediately effective . 
  sanctions do not operate like that , they have more of a mid and long term effects which would cripple future growth and create a number of problems later down the line . 
   if you were to get on the `` hype train '' of sanctions and fail to recognize when to jump off the loco , you might create a bigger mess than you initially intended to be . 
  thats all i am saying . 
  so it 's a videogame ? 
   i agree , we are already on the path of `` who is going to inflict the most amount of damage for the other side '' , but the desirable outcome for europe might slightly deviate from the path that russia will choose . 
  basically i think we both might loose more than we initially wanted , with some very ugly developments further down the line . 
  i 'm still confused ; what was the treaty you referred to breaking earlier ? 
   i see this a bit differently , in my opinion merkel has caved in into hawks and is on a path of non-stop sanctions every other month , regardless of ukrainians developments ( non-stop pressure until unconditional surrender so to speak ) . 
  that may be your opinion , but the facts are there in the open for anyone to see : for the first few months russia had to deal with minor sanctions based on the travel abilties of several of it 's political elite . 
  then as it insisted on maintaining it 's stance of aggression the sanctions slowly ratcheted up and are only now starting to effect the russian energy market . 
  there have been highly visible calls from within germany and in the greater eu to sanction the entirety of the russian energy market , gas and oil , from the very outset to force a quick resolution of events . 
  merkel did the most she could for russia by keeping these sanctions small and relatively painless for as long as she could , a more determined leader would not . 
  even now , there is talk about the sanctions being lifted next month if russia can be seen to be facilitating a peaceful resolution to events . 
  europe has been bending over backwards * not * to hit russia with hard sanctions . 
   it is unlikely that russia will tolerate such treatment , so `` voice of reason '' would be drown in `` hawkishness '' from both sides -  thus making things even worse . 
  here is the crux of the issue that i took pains to illustrate in my previous post : russia has no choice * but * to tolerate the sanctions . 
  there is no force it can wield to convince europe to drop these ; it can not forestall gas shipments to europe because it 's economy is dependant upon that revenue , and it can not match the eu or nato in force of arms .
