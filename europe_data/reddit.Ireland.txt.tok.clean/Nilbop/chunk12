  it 's only recourse is diplomacy , and there has been little sign of reasonable diplomacy from the likes of sergei lavrov while merkel has been extremely accomdating to the point of pissing off her own voter base . 
   chief analyst at dnb bank indr\u0117 genyt\u0117-pik\u010dien\u0117 says that meat exporters will face greater damage from the russian food imports embargo , whereas dairy producers have accumulated considerable financial reserves to get through this difficult period . 
  i think that 's the important bit : the dairy sector is expected to weather the embargo with little problem , but the meat sector will be harder hit ; pre-embargo lithuanian exported 25 % of it 's raw meat to russia . 
   ... said that the recruited citizens took part in trainings abroad to learn how to undertake actions of destabilizing . 
  that really worries me for the obvious parrallels it draws . 
   also it is possible that he is a vampire . 
  petition to rename finland * the land of eternal night . 
  i know . 
  i instantly distrust anyone who leaves me with a good impression . 
   what if countries economies do not operate like the game of civ ? 
  i 'm not sure what you are saying here . 
   what if you break the treaty and sanction someone it would have more of a middle and long term consequences and instigate a spiral of `` responses '' followed by the other side `` reacting '' to not look weak and `` stand by its european allies '' ? 
  break which treaty ? 
  i 'm a little confused by your arguement here , but both the eu and russia are already engaged in a spiralling game of tit-for-tat sanctions , and while russia 's responses have admittedly been much less potent than those issued from brussells it 's actions against estonia and poland are still indicative of a state that wants to be seen to respond aggressively to external pressure . 
  i can not see any `` allies '' entering into this engagement who are n't already embedded in it ; the eu and us have already made their stance clear and russia does not have allies that would be willing to risk economic and diplomatic relations with those two entities to join it in sanctions for no gain for themselves . 
  likewise the idea that any further countries would opt-in to sanctioning moscow seems unlikely , although i suppose it is conceivable that this could change in the unlikely event that irrefutable proof arises from the mh17 investigation that the putin regime is to blame for the destruction of the plane . 
   what if people often overreact to any bad news and create even more problems/complications , than they initially envisioned ? 
  i do n't think anyone is unsure about the nature of the sanctions/invasion of ukraine escalating . 
  in fact merkel 's hesitancy in particular to commit to stronger sanctions , as well as russians own limited sanctions , speaks volumes on this . 
  although it is true that the amount of sanctions russia could conceivably bring to bear against the eu/us without damaging it 's own economy severely is , at best , moderate . 
   there are others what ifs like how population perceives sanctions , who controls `` the perceiving mechanism '' and so on . 
  there have been several polls and articles in the media in recent weeks on this topic . 
  the citizenry of the eu seem to be strongly in favour of not just continuing sanctions but continuing to escalate them , and while i have n't seen any polls on the russian people 's opinions of their own sanctions , given the ongoing strong support of putin and the events in ukraine i would imagine they are also in support of continuing the current situation . 
   why is everything so simplistic and people think that if russia would immediately stop the support for `` rebels '' everything happen prior to that would magically go away well for several reasons , mostly because the heads of state of the eu have repeatedly ** said ** that ** this is exactly what it will take to stop the sanctions against russia ** ; full withdrawal of forces from ukraine 's sovereign territory , full withdrawal of backing of pro-russian rebels in the donbas , and in all likelihood reparations for the damage inflicted on ukraine by russia . 
   in a span of 1 month with zero consequences for respective parties involved ? 
  no-one is under any illusions that this will be the case . 
  russia has opened pandora 's box and the reprecussions for the invasion of ukraine will be felt for years diplomatically . 
  what it can control now is how long the effects will be felt * economically . 
  * what some pro-russian posters fail to understand , and i say this with no arrogance but as diplomatically as possible , is that these sanctions are not going away . 
  these sanctions are in lieu of military intervention in an armed invasion of a neighbour state to the eu . 
  the eu is not willing to mount an armed invasion , but they are concerned with protecting their neighbour , and their own interests in that region . 
  and yes , part of this is checking the advance of an apparently rapacious putin regime . 
  so the sanctions will continue to escalate until russia accedes to frankly absurdly reasonable demands . 
  the russian energy market , which shores up the entire economy , has already been hit with sanctions in it 's oil industry . 
  the obvious endgame option is sanctioning of the energy market in it 's entirety , particularly the enormous gas market , and preventing russia from accessing european capital markets ; the result of which would very likely be the collapse of the russian economy altogether , which nobody is eager to see . 
  russia can continue to reply with it 's own sanctions or threats of other actions , but the only real power it wields in europe is a ) an enormous military , which it will not utilize against an eu or nato member-state , and b ) it 's supply of energy , which it can not wield in great effect because of the overreliance of the russian economy upon the energy market . 
  what we 're likely to see from russian are a continuation of it 's tactics of targeting one or two of the smaller states with harsh actions , such as it 's limiting ( or cessation ? ), 
  of supply of gas to poland . 
  considering poland 's contribution to the eu these days i 'd expect to see a large fallout from this action however ; poland is very much a different country than the one that left the ussr . 
  threatening finland not to join nato , the kidnapping of the estonian counter-intelligence agent , threatening to close it 's airways to eu airlines , these are the kinds of aggressive tactics i 'd imagine we 'd see more of . 
  i 've often seen russian posters compare their country 's invasion of ukraine to the bush administration 's invasion of iraq , which is in some ways extremely fair . 
  but there are two points to consider here that differentiate those two conflicts ( aside from the concepts of annexation versus exploitation of natural resources ) : 1 . 
  russia does not have the power that the usa did then ( or does now ) to mount this invasion unopposed , whether militarily , economically or diplomatically . 
  the actors in the theatre of eastern europe are much more united , willing to act , and invested in the resolution of this conflict than the states of the middle east were , or were willing to be , in 2004 . 
  this is why russia is seeing economic sanctions and diplomatic hostility that it can not shake , which seems to have taken even the putin administration by surprise , which is why i assume they are making such loud noises about their new bffs china and iran . 
  there 's also little russia can do to get rid of this situation short of complying with demands ; the russian military is hands-down the largest in the region and a very formidable force that would likely overrun ukraine if brought to bear , but it ca n't use this force against it 's chief opponents because both nato and the eu have militaries that could subdue it . 
  that was longer than i thought it was going to be . 
  ** tl ; dr ** no-one believes this is going to end soon , but the only way it * does * end is with russia acceding to demands to remove itself from ukraine . 
  i remember when this story first broke there were rumours about the kidnapping being conducted by criminal elements instead of the state - i assume that 's been debunked now and it was an abduction of a state employee ? 
  so obviously any trial that occurs from this point on has no authority over the agent because his detention is illegitimate , right ? 
  i absolutely agree with the sentiment that these two goals go hand-in-hand . 
  it 's obvious that a decrease in dependancy on foreign energy sources , or at the least a decrease on the reliance of one soul supplier who wields a large amount of power , is a must if the eu is to survive in the future . 
  concessions in eu policy should not be made based on the supply of power from a non-member state . 
  at the same time this seems like the opportune moment to engage in a new wave of energy-creation across the continent . 
  i 'm sure i 'm not in the majority of this , but i 'm advocating pursuing nuclear power across the continent ( including major energy-users who currently oppose or have no plants ) , pursuing green energy where available whether wind , tidal or solar and increasing subsidies for this industry , as well as pursuing shale gas and fracking . 
  i would n't advocate giving carte-blanche to private ventures to pursue fracking anywhere in the continent but i think in the current client shoring up the eu 's own ability to supply itself with power takes short-term precidence , and once the political climate cools then we can address fracking again . 
  if you are presenting this as an opposing force against some of the most stable states and economies in the world , then it has to be long lasting . 
  a depressing situation that helps nobody . 
  hit the gas market and hit it hard and watch this conflict end . 
   how about , we give you rockall ? 
  ftfy, 
  i get depressed everytime i read about scotland 's attempts to set up overseas colonies . 
  it 's a lesson in how cunty countries can be to each other . 
  i was about to post this . 
  hopefully this whole energy crisis will cause people to shake off the boogeyman attached to nuclear power and seriously invest in it as a legitimate power source . 
  the duplicity here is impressive . 
  is this being denied like they denied reducing the flow to poland ? 
  it 's a complete nonsense article . 
  sometimes i forget that for the past 1000 years , only russia was ever at war . 
  this is why jingoistic blowhards never do well in international politics - everyone has the same history , everyone has bled and died for europe , every country existing in the world today does so because people gave their lives generation after generation for it do so . 
  willingly or unwillingly , gallantly or in ignominy , against brother and alien and everything in between , so when these men try to set their people as special , as having given * more * , they wonder why people are repelled by them , and all they can do is try to shout until they are red and sweating . . 
  just report him for trolling , a few people have messaged me that they have already . 
  sure you are . 
   that 's why energy union would be a great thing for eu . 
  and why nord stream pipeline was a bad thing . 
  schreder did eu a lot of harm ( and got bribes for it ) - he should have been taken to court for that . 
  behind you there . 
  the eu : a good work , in progress . 
  the only thing that bothers me is you chose my country 's flag to lie under . 
  so let me make sure i 've got this straight : your country lies to families and ships them thousands of miles from where they were told they were going into * siberia * , and your defense is personal attacks ? 
  this is the second big casualty of this conflict ; that russian posters and people in general are losing a lot of respect for their own personal actions in their absurd attempts to defend their indefensible government . 
  anyway , i 'm off to brush my teeth . 
  oh look , a russian shill account . 
   but who 's the victim if not russia ? 
  the families who you are shipping to siberia , 7,000 km from where you told them they 'd be ? 
  the country you are invading ? 
  the people you 've displaced ? 
   some shitty tabloid with sole purpose of publishing news on how terrible everything in russia yes , the * moscow times * would certainly have no interest in reporting with integrity events of interest to people in russia . 
  and what are you talking about with 0 evidence ? 
  the reporter is * talking to the affected families . 
  * did you even * read * the article ? 
  because you apparently know literally nothing about the recent history of your own country . 
  i 'm going to take everyone 's advice and ignore you now . 
  no , i mean you are n't getting this money for nothing , and if you were actually interested in the economic history of your country you 'd see how it 's been remarkably improved by membership in the eu . 
  what the hell you 're on about with football fields is beyond me , but whatever , you can hang by your own ignorance . 
  dude if your country is actually doing this then yeah , you are going to take a * lot * of shit for it . 
  jesus christ the amount of russian self-pity and victim-shaming on here is unbelievable . 
  you do n't understand the nature of them then . 
  well , then they 're lying . 
  pretty easy to prove .
