  i want to see an end to pussyfooting around and a concerted effort to end this absurd situation as soon as possible . 
  that means a lot of heavy-handed changes that people need to be willing to make and germany in particular , together with france and the uk , need to be united behind this : 1 . 
  sanctioning the russian energy market . 
  this is the only sanction that matters and everybody knows it , everything else is just nibbling away while the bear does what he wants . 
  this feeds into 2 related points . 
  accept that a deterioration in diplomatic relationships with moscow is an inevitability and that the eu gains nothing by bending over backwards to placate and entertain a government that has demonstrated again and again it is only interested in advancing it 's own interests with little thought to those of it 's neighbours , which it itself so often demands of others . 
  reduce energy dependency on russia and explore other sources . 
  the eu is in the enviable position of having a fairly positive diplomatic image and stable , growing economy overall with a wealth of trade partners , several of whom have intimated that they 'd be interested in expanding their trade deals if we ever decided to explore other options . 
  this should have been considered long ago - one sole energy supplier for around 33 % of the continent 's energy should never have been allowed to happen ; it only hurts us , it never helps . 
  boots on the ground in ukraine , at kiev 's invitation , for both medical , subsistence and military aid . 
  this conflict needs to end and ukraine needs help consolidating and rebuilding the donbas . 
  oversight into whatever administrative restructuring needs to occur in ukraine to insure that all parties are equally represented , while being wary of ongoing russian destabilization that i would have no reason to believe would end simply because the armed rebellion is put down . 
  a concerted push for an organized , unified military funded and contributed by all states . 
  i 'm not suggesting american levels of investment which frankly even they should scale back on , but there is no reason the eu should n't be fielding the top military in the world when it has germany , the uk and france as major contributors on top of italy , spain , poland , sweden and everyone else . 
  an effort from both berlin and london to integrating the uk into the eu more . 
  i 'm concerned about the long-term direction of the body where france is the only counter to german interests . 
  i 'm also aware this is at best tangentially related to the topic at hand , but it 's key to the ongoing success of the eu . 
  dismissing kremlin claims to ukraine out of hand , including all demands that kiev be denied any path to joining the eu . 
  russia has absolutely no basis to claim any rights of governance that should be made by kiev and this needs to be openly stated and respected . 
  i 'd be interested to see if / u/gernshen4px could substantiate his arguement . 
  thanks , but he 's obviously arguing for an agenda and is purposefully avoiding anything like honest debate . 
  substantiate any of that , please . 
  you are n't making any sense . 
  do you not believe russian military men can steal industrial equipment or are you ... trying to argue something else ? 
  see i 'm not as smart as you , when i read reports on the truck drivers admitting to be part of the military from several source i believe it , so please just answer the question . 
  absolutely , this is galling to read . 
  the wording implies germany is heading the dissenting group , which implies that the remaining are minor member-states . 
  remember when you invaded their country earlier this year ? 
  that 's why you are playing games . 
  of course i 'm talking to rinnve so i 'm not expecting anything except hard and fast shilling so whatever . 
  ask them again when charles is king . 
  this guy gets it . 
   that is also why there are so many tricoloured flags . 
  could you explain a little more about this ? 
  ** reasons why you should think the soldier 's song is the best national anthem : ** 1 . 
  if you think the brits should go fuck themselves . 
  if you like bitter old songs written by bitter old men intended to be sung by bitter old men . 
  seriously , see those brits ? 
  fuck those guys , right ? 
  do n't mention northern ireland . 
  do n't mention * ireland 's call * 6 . 
  if you are in croke park and it 's the all-ireland final and it 's dublin versus [ whatever team from munster got out of bed and fell through the qualifying rounds ] then it 's pretty great . 
  if you 've been drinking , and you should , because we 're all on a dying rock spinning through space orbiting a burning fucking ball of fire . 
  point out the part of my sentence where i mentioned the equipment being stolen . 
  i 've got all day . 
  good for them . 
  `` a bunch of truck drivers '' who several admitted to being from the military , implying they were * all * from the military . 
  i know i just had these new glass walls and floors installed but i * just ca n't stop throwing these rocks !!, 
  an irishman burned down the white house once . 
  he was born in my village , even . 
  the pertinent points :  washington -- the russian military has moved artillery units manned by russian personnel inside ukrainian territory in recent days and was using them to fire at ukrainian forces , nato officials said on friday ...  ... 
  the russian move represents a significant escalation of the kremlin 's involvement in the fighting there and comes as a convoy of russian trucks with humanitarian provisions has crossed into ukrainian territory without kiev 's permission ...  ... `` these developments are even more worrying as they coincide with a major escalation in russian military involvement in eastern ukraine since mid-august , including the use of russian forces , '' the statement continued , adding : `` we have also seen transfers of large quantities of advanced weapons , including tanks , armored personnel carriers and artillery to separatist groups in eastern ukraine . 
  moreover , nato is observing an alarming buildup of russian ground and air forces in the vicinity of ukraine . '' not that i doubt this is actually happening on the ground there but i would appreciate satellite pictures or even a mention of what the proof is , unless i 've missed it . 
  do either of you understand the point of the sanctions or why sterner action is n't being taken ? 
  [ ** oliver cromwell ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oliver_cromwell ) * religious zealout-come-dictator * born again christian * overthrew parliament and eventually replaced it with himself as `` lord protector '' * enacted genocide against the irish and displaced them from their land * targeted and killed civilians during the siege of drogheda , including 3500 after the fall of the city , which he wrote was a `` righteous judgement of god . '', 
  * at the following siege of wexford , while the irish troops were negotiating surrender several thousand of cromwell 's men broke into the town , killed 2000 men at arms and 1,500 civilians and burned much of the town to the ground . 
  * after he departed for england his generals continued his policy of mass killing , eviction and shipping over 50,000 men , women and children as pows and indentured servants to british colonies in barbados and bermuda . 
  * his succesor to command , general ireton , pursued a deliberate strategy of mass crop-burnings and starvation , resulting in the ultimate deaths of around 600,000 of a total population of 1,400,000 . 
  * all catholic-owned land was confiscated and given to english and scottish settlers and cromwell 's creditors and soldiers . 
  * the remaining landowners were given much smaller , poorer land in connaught , declaring that the irish go `` to hell or connaught , '' dropping catholic landownership from over 60 % to under 8 % . 
  * catholocism was banned and all catholic priests that were captured were put to death , forcing the majority to worship in secret . 
  * barred the catholic majority from entering the irish parliament , and briefly banned them from living in towns . 
  * the campaign as a whole destroyed the native irish catholic land-owning classes , who were replaced by english protestants who took over the land , leading to a surge of resentment and providing the impetus for the rise of irish nationalism in the 17th century onwards . 
  * still revered by many in england ; in 2002 he was voted one of the ** top 10 britons of all time ** . 
  um , no we do n't . 
   russia has said its ban on eu food imports will cost it `` hundreds of billions of rubles '' in subsidies . 
   its agriculture minister , nikolai fyodorov , told the rossiya 24 broadcaster on wednesday ( 20 august ) the government has set aside 50 billion rubles ( $ 1.03 bn ) for this year to keep shop shelves stocked with eu-type products . 
  it 's almost like this was n't well thought out in the first place . 
  i 'm 95 % sure whoever did this did it just to piss off the brits . 
  god things had cool names then . 
  i know lithuania has a player on our local nba team ( toronto raptors ) but i had no idea they have this national basketball pride thing going on . 
  well you 've always got parc asterix . 
  it would be nice if the laws reflected popular opinion more , yeah . 
  he was better than bertie , at least . 
   how can you use an embargo on your own countries economy to treath other countries like eu is doing ? 
  well , the eu is n't embargoing itself , so ... ? 
  do you guys call st petersburg * pitr * ? 
  that makes total sense , i just never thought about it till now . 
  this is that irony thing i 've been hearing about , is n't it ? 
  because i 'm so lonely :(, 
  and they never sit beside you on their buses !, 
  the source is the daily mail , so in all likelihood anything could have actually happened except what was actually reported . 
  because it 's not true . 
  the energy market is literally shoring up the russian economy , there is no outcome where a tumble in the price of their commodities does anything but damage them . 
  might as well piss and moan about helping people hit by sanctions we enacted . 
  every now and then you just get sick of seeing three differently coloured rectangles stacked vertically or horizontally . 
  i feel like this narrative is something people have clung to to build russians up as this big scary other regardless of any basis in fact or whatever . 
  there are a few clubs , yes , and they are absolutely also divided into nationalist and unionist fanbases based on their geographical areas , but celtic and rangers are much bigger clubs than any in ireland and for historical reasons there 's been a lot of ties between that region and scotland . 
  are you reading anything i 'm writing or just responding to `` the voices '' again ? 
  every continent is made up . 
  we 've all sort of accepted there is no giant rubber stamp somewhere saying `` europe . '', 
  red flag , red flag people, 
  that 's a fair point , but i think it has as much to do with pride about coming from europe , as broad and absurd as that may be , as much as a dividing line between us and the us . 
  greatest continent on earth and all that . 
  irish  british  nationalist  liverpool fc although for many in northern ireland there 's generally only the two types : irish  nationalist/republican  celtic fc british  unionist/loyalist  rangers fc, 
  i was gon na make a joke about dykes here but i did n't think it 'd hold water . 
  you both misunderstood the core concept , which was that city corporations literally have the right to vote . 
  but whatever . 
  you know you 're the good guys when your leaders start introducing the death penalty . 
  shots fired .
