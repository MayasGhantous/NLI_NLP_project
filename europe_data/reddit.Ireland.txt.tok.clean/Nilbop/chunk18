   you are aware that i replied in a thread asking to shut down my ( and everybody else 's ) access to russian media ? 
  no , you replied in a thread * reporting * on why viasat will * not * stop broadcasting russian media . 
  do not twist the facts . 
   nobody is forced to watch it if they do not want to but those who want to should be able to do so - right ? 
  yes . 
  although i would prefer they be aware that their outlet of choice is a discredited source of propaganda when there are other , more trustworthy sources available , your poison is as ever your own to pick . 
  it 's not a point of view , it 's an objective , verifiable fact ; the only two sides are the russian media which report stories as they are told to by the kremlin , and then there is the media outlets of the rest of the world , who do not . 
  it 's your choice to view whatever you like , but it 's also your duty to inform yourself that both sides are n't even close to equal . 
  there are n't two sides to this , except in the very basic sense that there is russian state-dictated propaganda with no objectivism , and then there is everything else . 
  no , nothing like over-using a term to whitewash an arguement to rob it of all legitimacy . 
  *** motherfucker ***, 
  tell you this much : the craic is ninety there . 
  nonsense . 
  everyone knows the children of the forest have been gone for thousands of years . 
  the more i read this thread the more i realize that i understand absolutely nothing about relations in south-east europe . 
   uk medias regularly publish shitty articles full of clich\u00e9s and incorrect facts saying how france is depressed or declining , french media mock them and list their clich\u00e9s or misinformations , but do n't publish the same type of articles towards uk . 
  i 'll start off by saying i only briefly worked in paris , but i * do * work with a bunch of frenchies and that 's really not been my experience . 
  i 've seen tons of articles of french making fun of the english . 
  norn iron : prod favourite : literally any english person that will acknowledge us . 
  prod nemesis : fenian cunts in the south . 
  taig favourite : our free brothers in the south . 
  taig nemesis : i guess england , whatever . 
  brits or spaniards do n't neighbour russia . 
  the long and short of it is russian has 2 realistic cards to play 1 . 
  turn off the gaz ( which they 'd never do , because the eu would go spare ) 2 . 
  military action against ukraine ( which seems unlikely as every country on earth is looking at them right now ) sanctioning polish apples and canadian bacons is n't going to change anyone 's policy except at home . 
  okay , that one i had n't seen . 
  and now i 'll never be able to say that again !, 
  thanks chum !, 
  let 's be honest , not a lot of us are ever going to get to koq-to-be hill in kazakhstan . 
  bono keeps trying to throw himself in it . 
  you are arguing for a reasonable standpoint on a currently prominent , emotional issue by arguing that the people you are pleading for sanity with are all controlled by fascists . 
  did you expect a hand to come down from the heavens and high-five what an awesome burn you just made there ? 
   but it 's also pretty amusing that every second post on this sub is a link that portrays russia in a negative light . 
  this is because russia is dealing with a negative image right now , a fact that you do n't seem capable of accepting . 
   in this case , how do i not agree with his viewpoint ? 
  i kindly requested him to view my reply to nahden no , you did n't . 
  you 've been overly belligerent and aggressive since you 've started posting in this topic and do n't seem interested in engaging in good-faith debate so much as shouting down or libeling your opponents . 
   am i really wrong to suggest that op is blatantly twisting the whole 2008 georgia conflict to try to win over some sympathy over the current one ? 
  being russian on reddit is kind of like being the girl from the south ossetia conflict ( in related news ) . 
  you can argue this certainly as long as you put together an actual position . 
  your original post consisted of : 1 . 
  saying wikipedia was n't an acceptable reference point for a non-current news issue . 
  referencing the shelling of tshkinvali , implying his source does not when in fact it does . 
  libel him as russophobic . 
  libel him as knowing he is wrong but continuing with an agenda . 
  vityok has made his position known on ukraine/russian topics many times by this point and he 's not exactly an unbiased party . 
  that being said try and put your point forward without being so malicious about it . 
  the past few years have done an amazing job of robbing that term of it 's bite . 
  you mean that 's why you put `` experts '' in quotes ... 
  * antisemitically . 
  * you mean putin could n't deliver on his nationalistic rhetoric ? 
  i find this truely shocking and surprising * - fucking nobody . 
  i 'm so glad this is the first response . 
  in my experience it 's only `` hateful people '' that try to dismiss others as `` hateful people '' when they come across a viewpoint they do n't agree with . 
  limitlessltd goes too far with his rhetoric , but russia is absolutely dealing with negative political capital now and it has almost entirely itself to blame for this situation . 
  i rather imagine not being able to import `` agricultural products '' from the entire eu will inconvenience russian business and markets as well . 
  it seems like a very broad and ill-defined choice of words . 
  yes . 
  for example , it 's * much * less expensive than funding a giant laser to write '' * fuck russia * '' on the moon . 
  * bangs hammer on stone floor * what do ye seek under the mountain ? 
  it 's a * very * big if . 
  in fact , if you 've got a moment , it 's a twelve-storey if with a magnificent entrance hall , carpeted throughout , 24-hour portorage and an enormous sign on the roof saying '' ** this is a big if ** . '', 
  sure i can hear * baba yetu * playing in the background . 
  jesus christ i love that first map . 
  just a list of all these grand nations that have left indelible imprints upon the global consciousness , and then there 's ** mayo . 
  yeah but generally a time of mass-migration is spurred on by some negative event rather than a golden age of prosperity . 
  though the latter is certainly possible , that was n't the case in ireland at that time . 
  i would n't make the arguement for what was essentially a 5-year real estate boom but i 'm not going to knock anyone for trying . 
  i 'm going to steal that . 
  do they get top gear in russia ? 
  c'mon now fella . 
  i 'm sorry but the narrative championed by mostly russian posters here that a cold-war mentality exists , especially on ground-level journalism where a lot of younger writers cut their teeth , is i think terrfically overblown . 
  there 's some substance to it i 'm sure , and there 's definitely a certain amount of jingoism and blustering going on between both sides , but i think the cold war-redux media narrative does n't have any legs . 
  literally the entirety of my knowledge of spanish history comes from crusader kings 2 and now i 'm reading about things like * blas infante * and what have you . 
  you could say he came a long way . 
  this is pretty cool , although it could be improved with more journey . 
  just a random question ; as a petrostate why would russia prefer `` arabs that have petroleum '' ? 
  nobody 's been seriously injured , right ? 
  i think it 's fatuous to say that anyone has been ignoring what hamas has been doing , given the reality of political , financial and arms-based support for israel . 
  this could cause a bit of a stink for cameron ; warsi was one of the faces of the tories and one of the most prominent women and muslims in government . 
  djmedic , when prodded , reveals himself to not know nearly half as much as he 'd like you to believe . 
  ah c'mon now , you did allright under her . 
  jesus christ , ireland ? 
  i suppose you could say the early-medieval/viking era , when the roman empire had up and caligula 'd itself and the continent was busy kicking itself in the balls , ireland was a relative safespot . 
  this is the period when it gained the nickname `` isle of saints and scholars '' thanks to the works of the illuminators in recording and keeping a lot of knowledge of the roman empire . 
  and of course england was a bit shit at that point so that 's always a bonus . 
  you could also argue the era of the celtic renaissance or just the time since partition , which has generally been not-completely-shit . 
  for those down south at least . 
  is this an easier question to answer if you compartmentalize russia ? 
  if you just focus on the moscow or st petersburg area or what have you ? 
  and what about that catherine lady ? 
  i know virtually nothing about her but was n't her rule considered very profitable for the country ? 
  man this whole thing is an enormous mess . 
  it 's worth it though , all of it , just for the feeling of being a kid and watching * the late late toy show * near christmas . 
  things to do in sweden : 1 . 
  have sex with attractive people . 
  in all fairness it 's difficult to envision a future where poland does * not * become a much more important player on the major stage . 
  no , this tells us there are no jobs for grads or labourers , you twit . 
  the gta alone has been receiving 40,000 irish people annually for 4 years now .
