  as one of the like , 3 * norn iron * ers active on reddit i 'm going to add a bunch of qualifiers for any of you going to northern ireland : ** do ** swear and be prepared to sworn at casually all the godfucking time . 
  i 'm serious . 
  * norn iron * is one of the most casually profane areas on the * planet * and you will be called a dickhead , shitebag , cunt , fucker , fuckface , arsewipe and wankshaft on a daily basis . 
  ** do n't ** let it get to you . 
  we 're mostly a bunch of cunts and we do n't mean it maliciously , but with * norn iron * having the history it does it just makes it expedient to address your friends the same as your enemies , just more fondly so . 
  ** do ** be prepared not to understand a word we say . 
  the ulster twang is incredibly nasily and when you 're in belfast or derry the average person will be taking pride in sounding as bizarre as possible . 
  ** do n't ** insist on a particular name for derry . 
  holy shit , this is an instant alienation button . 
  just go along with whatever anyone else is saying and do not ask about why someone refers to it as londonderry . 
  ** do n't ** go around asking about the ira . 
  i 'm looking at * you * , american students in the crown bar . 
  actually , do n't bring this topic up in public at all . 
  if you are going to ask about the troubles , at least know a little about what the troubles were and the fact that there were mass-murdering paramilitary organizations on both sides . 
  ** do ** be prepared for the `` rounds '' system in pubs . 
  this is common in both ireland and the uk ; if you are with a group of buds , one person will buy everyone a drink , and then when they 're done the next person buys everyone a drink , and so on and so on . 
  not everyone likes this system because you can end up spending a lot more than you intended and you are kind of `` locked in '' to drinking for a while , but try not to leave before you 've bought at least one round . 
  ** do ** be prepared to encounter contextual geography ; depending on who you are talking to , you may find yourself to be in ireland , the south , the north , norn iron or ulster . 
  most students and professionals are open minded about this but most working-class wankshafts will insist on being cunts about this . 
  ** do ** be prepared for there to be no police station within 50 miles of you . 
  if you are in a predominantly nationalist area that the peelers historically did not give a shit about prepare for it to take over an hour for them to get their asses to wherever the gippos have dumped you . 
  ** do n't ** buy anything from the gippos . 
  this goes for the south too ; holy fuck there are a lot of gippos here . 
  ... ha - * ha * !, 
  are we sure this was n't philip ? 
  that sounds much more his area of expertise . 
  if you are expecting me to believe your people are having trouble finding buyers for motherfucking * apples * i do n't know what to tell you . 
  they 're not exactly niche . 
  the fuck 's the problem with greenland ? 
  i hate to corroborate but i 've had this exact experience before as well , with the exception being that me and the missus were down in perpignon instead of paris . 
  i know you probably do n't want to back down and lose face in front of everyone , but luckily for you you 've just passed the point where that 's no longer an issue . 
  was n't their military still shown-up as a soviet-era mess as late as the georgian war in 2008 ? 
  i remember it being something of an embarassment for them . 
  aw , that 's nice :-), 
  in all seriousness i do n't want a song that 's supposed to be the very beat that my country runs to , to be about how happy we are that the fucking prods finally fucked off . 
  toad in the hole is both tasty * and * hilarious , a trait that * continental * nations have n't seemed to got the hang of yet . 
  what is your president doing in bruges ? 
  most anthems are terrible , and * the soldier 's song * is n't any exception . 
  it 's literally just a minute of saying all english people are cunts . 
  bonus points for the fact that half the time we substitute the abhorrent * ireland 's call * for it at rugby matches . 
  the british national anthem is just a minute straight talking about how their queen is the best queen , and it sucks too . 
  the frenchies got it allright , i guess . 
  most of the rest are pants . 
  i know absolutely nothing about this rivalry but i am strangely compelled to encourage it right away . 
  that might be one of the most british things i 've ever heard . 
  all i can tell you is that i emmigrated to canada 4 years ago to find an actual career for myself and there are still thousands of young people from the uk and ireland arriving in the toronto area alone every year . 
  meanwhile my facebook feeds from people back at home are talking about factory closures and looking to `` change career paths '' by working in a game store . 
  they 're amphibious assault ships . 
  why are italy and spain so comfortably anti-sanction on this ? 
  i 'm not sure i get it . 
  i 'm so tired of hearing about thsi narrative . 
  it 's still nice to see * some * sort of russian media showing empathy for other people and attempting to take responsibility , even if that 's not their cross to bear . 
  the daily mail is an absolute rag and not worth anyone 's time to read . 
  * this is the dawning of the age of aquarius , the age of aquarius *, 
  that looks like a top gear challenge . 
  til ai n't nobody sarcasms harder than poland . 
  the garda too . 
  one day guardian . 
  i 'm asking you to go one day without publishing an article that does n't make me roll my eyes out of my fucking head . 
  the world cup ( potentially ) makes it 's host current a huge amount of money and is a very prestigious event to host . 
  i would 've thought jurgen klinsmen would 've known that . 
  well , what 's happening at fifa is a lot of very fat , very old and very corrupt men who do n't care a lot about football or other people are deciding whether or not they want to give up a lot of money to make a humanitarian statement that wo n't benefit them financially . 
  i 'll allow you the pleasure of imagining their response . 
  you 've conceded the point , i do n't care about debating with you how much you 've lost . 
  allright , you called me out so here i am . 
   have you even read what the irish guy said ? 
  `` i would prefer they not take 5 days to let forensic teams into the scene of an airline crash , thanks '' . 
  go tell that to him . 
   how are you not getting that the access to a contested site in a warzone will be restricted if ceasefire negociations have n't amounted to anything , and that some security thus can not be guaranteed ? 
  so in your world `` access '' for a forensic team is `` too far away to do our jobs , but in the same general area as the crash . '', 
  that is n't access . 
  and in your world it is perfectly safe to let the osce teams into the contested warzone , but not * this bit * of the contested warzone , because it is * extra * contested . 
  i suppose the ukrainian army was likely to shell a high profile plane crash filled with international forensic experts , just like when they did n't shell it over the past 5 days when the crash site was solely occupied by the rebels they were suppressing . 
  i 'm tired of hearing people like you trot out this false equivalency day after day after * day * . 
  russian media is controlled by one central organ , `` western '' media is not , and even before the ukraine situation emerged had far more respected institutions than rt and itar-itass . 
  any viewpoint is easy when you paint your detractors as subhuman morons , sure . 
  i would prefer they not take 5 days to let forensic teams into the scene of an airline crash , thanks . 
  goody . 
   the west invaded russia to prevent it from becoming socialist what 's this , then ? 
  i honestly expected this to be a jeremy clarkson bit . 
   uk intelligence officials have have intercepted communications between pro-russian separatists discussing deliberate attempts to tamper with the scene of the disaster . 
   evidence indicates rebels talked about removing victims ' remains from the fields of grabavo , where the plane was shot down . 
  absolutely . 
  i do n't think people credit enough that one of the big fears for putin is that he knows how long it would take to actually put any new major gas deal into practice . 
  his economy would take a pounding . 
  i do n't understand why we only get half of scotland . 
  actually half of these are bizarre to me . 
  yes everyone , welcome to the concrete cultural realm of the english midlands . 
  have you been to milton keynes ? 
  ah yes , trusted news source www.everythinglubbock.com, 
  you will never , ever , ever get that level of proof . 
  it 's frankly juvenile to assume you would . 
  war does not work on that level . 
  putin is reportedly stunned that his `` make veiled threats to everyone '' policy seems to have backfired . 
  that 's not what the bnp has been saying . 
  to be frank , it sounds like bribery to me . 
  did you just link me to your blog ? 
  ah , fair enough . 
  chiming in to say it 's different in northern ireland . 
  if you are catholic/nationalist ( i.e pro-united ireland ) you vote for sinn fein ( or sometimes the sdlp ) .
