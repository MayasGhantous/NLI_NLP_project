  people are perfectly free to downvote you if they disagree with your point . 
  this does n't mean they are doing so simply because they do n't like it or do n't like you . 
  it 's a bit surprising you do n't understand this . 
   not all countries have equal traditions of protecting liberty do they ? 
  speaking as a man born and raised in northern ireland and with an interest in british and irish history ; ** no ** , they do ** not ** . 
   the uk 's tradition of rights of the individual against the state goes back 800 years . 
  the fact that the uk has a particularly strong tradition is really not a tabloid argument . 
  why do you think that the uk was so instrumental in creating the echr in the first place ? 
  is your position that the uk does not have a proud tradition of liberties ? 
  the greeks have laws regarding rights of the person versus the city-state going back thousands of years , perhaps we should have them draft all our hr legislation if seniority is such a valued commodity . 
  you do n't seem to understand that britain 's history with human rights is not exceptional . 
  it 's admirable , certainly but so are those of most other european countries , beginning with france in my personal opinion . 
  and again you slip in a nonsense phrase like `` proud tradition of liberties . '', 
  this is literally meaningless filler . 
   it does seem that i know more than you about this area . 
  you 're right that the results of cases can have an enormous impact . 
  this is one of the reasons why the uk should pull out . 
  again , this is just an opinion , and in my view and apparently that of a few others a dismissable one . 
  as a side note , if you do n't know what primacy means just message me and i 'll be happy to explain it for you . 
   dude , you are downvoting me because of my opinion . 
  this is very normal in r/europe . 
  i gave an opinion . 
  i argued it . 
  i gave a reason . 
  and that arguement was found wanting . 
  just because you have a right to an opinion does n't mean it has to be heard . 
   the views of philosophers over the centuries on the uk 's tradition of liberties is certainly relevant to my claim that the uk has a long tradition of liberties . 
  i find it surprising that you think this view should be limited to tabloids . 
  and a depressing return to weasel words . 
  your kind of arguement belongs in the tabloids - of * course * britain has a history of liberty and human rights , as well as opression , invasion and slavery , just as any other nation . 
  it 's as irrelevant as citing the opinion of a dead french poet and hoping it gains you some legitimacy . 
  moreso , it is simply your opinion that said dead french poet 's view is relevant , and it 's not a position you can back up or expand upon . 
   there is a strong parliamentary majority in favour of this . 
  this is obviously relevant . 
   you 're mixing up eu concepts `` member state '' , `` primacy '' , with the echr . 
  it is on quite a different footing from the cjeu in relation to `` primacy '' . 
  the results of echr cases can have enormous impact on national policy . 
  i 'm not at all sure you know what you are talking about , but i 'm sure you can find me a lovely poem about it . 
   i 'm not complaining about people disagreeing . 
  i 'm complaining about the fact that you are downvoting me in breach of rediquette . 
  and yet you still do n't seem able to understand that your own post was at fault for being dismissable . 
   i 'm simply repeating what voltaire and montesquieu said . 
  do you consider those philopsophers to be tabloids ? 
  voltaire also believed blacks were n't fully human . 
  both are indeed irrelevant to the topic . 
  perhaps the next time your favourite team loses you can bring up something nice kierkegaard once said about your home . 
   there is a consensus on this issue . 
  still no . 
   i 'm not sure what you are talking about here , because the echr is not a legislative body so can not pass legislation . 
  i mispoke , and also forgot to include italics on * going * . 
  it is going to pass rulings that will conflict with pre-existing british legislation . 
  a key power of the echr is that it 's judgements take primacy over those of it 's member states . 
  you should know this . 
   i 've not said it is this issue alone , have i ? 
  there are other reasons too . 
  it 's strange that you 'd fail to bring them up and yet complain quite prominently about people disagreeing with your half-explained position then . 
  your posts are stuffed with nonsense rhetoric which rather easily educate on your opinions ;  the uk has a lengthy and proud tradition of liberties as if phrases like this have a place outside of the tabloids . 
  the idea that britain should pull out of an immensely important organ like the echr because of the prisoners votes issue is ludicrous , particularly when there is no concensus on the issue and you present no stance of your own . 
  furthermore , the echr is * going * to pass legislation that conflicts with parliament . 
  you act as if this is a surprise to anyone - the entire point of the echr is that it supercedes the laws of the member states in order to protect universal human rights while also taking their views into consideration . 
  the idea that you want people to believe you will take your ball and run home based on the voting issue alone is absurd and dismissable nonsense . 
  sorry , it 's not . 
  i do n't agree with it , certainly , but that 's because it is broad , based in nationalistic logic and not terribly substantiated . 
  that is just your opinion , i 'm afraid . 
  i 'm personally downvoting you because your opinion is so broad and banal as to be unconstructive . 
  in what way have the last wave of sanctions `` bounced back '' ? 
  downvoting you is not a breach of rediquette . 
   what is really important to most people is being able to work ( and this is something most europeans who move to the uk can do within a couple of weeks if they put their mind to it ) . 
  ah yes , * david cameron 's bootstraps brigade * . 
  definitely hanging on to this . 
  it would be great if someone could post all the stuff that the separatists are deleting relating to the crash , too . 
  just to keep me from obsessing over this crash , i thought tourism in crimea was already not going according to putin 's plan of 1 million people a month or whatever it was . 
  has that changed ? 
  it was flying at such an altitude so as to make it effectively removed from the warzone . 
  only an advanced ballistic missile could have reached it , which generally rest in the hands of governments that would have the ability to tell that this was a passenger jet and not a military one . 
  the separatists are in big , big trouble over this . 
  god help the families seeing this ... 
  you seem to be the man to ask , so what does the buk missile itself signify ? 
  is it a particularly advanced missile ? 
  does it indicate one party over another ? 
  would ukraine or the separatists have access to it , and the ability to use it to shoot down an airliner ? 
  sorry , just to be clear - there were 2 planes shot down in eastern ukraine today ? 
  one military and one non-military ? 
  the separatists are claiming to have shot down the non-military one , right ? 
  any hint of that missile is going to be long gone before the press are allowed in . 
  it rhymes , so i 'm instantly swayed . 
  ukip are foul , but they definitely are n't part of the oxbridge bubble that the big 2 + 1 are . 
  you did n't say * regime-change * this time . 
  you 're slipping . 
  i grew up in a small enough village in a rural area that when a clan of gypsies rolled in with about 20 caravans it 'd be a major disruption to the village itself . 
  the main industry was tourism , and the gypsies would take over ( and demolish ) the main caravan site ; gouging the earth , digging up firepits and destroying outdoor faucets and the public washrooms . 
  the mothers would dander down to the square and try to sell wildflowers to shopowners as they cased the joint , and when the business owner would ask them to leave , they 'd lay a curse on them and then send their men around later to wreck and rob . 
  then there was the issue with making them leave ; you could n't . 
  the psni was n't interested in policing in south down because we were too catholic and too near the bandit country in armagh , and the gippos knew it . 
  so in the end it literally came down to local farmers banding together with guns and dogs and literally driving them off . 
  these were the consistent , every-time problems . 
  the one-time-only deals were more outlandish ; a gippo drove his 100k merc into a 400 year old oak tree in the town square ; a family let their baby take a shit in the holy water font in the church entrance ; a bunch of youths slit the throat of the border collie owned by the man who owned the post office , and then hung it outside his building . 
  they even attempted to claim a field used ( as in , in * current * use ) for cattle as their own because of some longstanding agreement they had apparently had with the field 's previous owner and began to dig foundations in the middle of it for a huge mansion . 
  the owner of the field literally brought his sons out and drove straight into their caravan with his jcb . 
  in short , sometimes `` strong-arming '' these people is the only solution you 've got , particularly if you are dealing with a group that think they know what they can get away with and will push that to the absolute limits .
