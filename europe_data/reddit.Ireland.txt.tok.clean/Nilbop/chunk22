  if the constabulary want to save the civilians the bother of doing it , all the better . 
  jesus christ how have you not suffocated to death through sheer stupidity . 
  great rebuttal of his points there , vigorous . 
  really shows the depth of your intelligence and knowledge on the subject . 
  generally if you are planning to play one party off the other you do n't announce it to both parties in advance . 
  there has never been an instance in history where calling a white man a cracker has been equivalent to calling a black man a monkey . 
  as an aside , the fact that it * has * been used does n't mean it makes * sense . 
  are you aware of the importance of context and history in this scenario or are you being intentionally obtuse ? 
  do you feel your rights as a white man are being repressed by this black person 's right not to be dehumanized being protected ? 
  it would n't make sense if you called a black person one , either . 
  there 's a reason that joke was made about the un and not the eu . 
  so as you may have guessed , and as the title neglects to mention , the minister is black . 
  france is struggling with racial issues in the modern era , this had to be a high profile and immediate punishment . 
  abso-fucking-lutely not . 
   global governments , the tech sector , and scholars are closely following a legal flap in which the us justice department claims that microsoft must hand over e-mail stored in dublin , ireland . 
   in essence , president barack obama 's administration claims that any company with operations in the united states must comply with valid warrants for data , even if the content is stored overseas . 
  it 's a position microsoft and companies like apple say is wrong , arguing that the enforcement of us law stops at the border . 
  you wrote for the harvard law review , obama , you * know * this shit has no legal or moral merit . 
  ... is there a reason you bolded tony ? 
  were we going to confuse him with another blair ? 
  i did n't actually know it was , and now i 'm really interested and reading up on it , so thanks !, 
  only doran 's lame , and technically he 's a prince . 
  sochi was great , so obviously i 'm looking forward to the shots of football pitches with two goals side by side at the same end . 
  hey check it out dude it 's almost like a country 's reputation follows it around or something is n't that crazy, 
  ... * what * welfare ? 
  jesus that 's the most depressed looking currency i 've ever seen . 
  i 'm actually feeling bad for banknotes . 
  germany because pax europa and all that , and because the argentinian fans in toronto make me want to fucking kill somebody . 
  does any other military behave like this ? 
  you never hear about france flying their * bombeurs * over the german border . 
  suck it , spain and italy !, 
  *** just another in the proud list of things we beat you in :  rugby  alcoholism  country kind of looks like a weird witch 's face, 
  paging / u/vigorous to this thread . 
  * a modest proposal 2 : donbas boogaloo *, 
  yeah he 's ... he 's not actually reading what you wrote . 
  you realize nobody actually reads your stuff , right ? 
  i mean , you come off as a literal crazy person . 
  i 'm not explaining to you the history of the most storied continent on earth . 
  are you seriously arguing on one hand the relationship between france and russia and on the other arguing that member states lack historical and political cohesion ? 
  i mean , that 's a really , * really * stupid arguement . 
  here i 'll just leave this ready-to-cut-and-paste paragraph here for future use :  suprising no-one , russia worsened diplomatic relations with _____ today after saying ____ . 
  meanwhile ** [ president ] ** / ** [ prime minister ] ** ( delete as appropriate ) has announced the public takeover of russia 's last remaining independant _____ , amidst worries of ** [ western ] ** / ** [ eu ] ** / ** [ nato ] ** / ** [ ukranian vampire nazi ] ** propaganda . 
  ireland gets mentioned relatively often given the large number of expats living in the english-speaking world , but in recent years any mention has tended to resolve around the bail out , church abuses or something bono said . 
  so general good old shame , i guess . 
  a legend would be really , * really * helpful here . 
  principally , the mean old men . 
  what the fuck does any of this have to do with ** anything . 
  that 's not answering the question . 
  if the king asked you to kill your prime minister , would you ? 
  would you kill the king for the pm ? 
  would you lay down your family 's lives so the king 's bloodline could remain on the throne ? 
  would you send your son to war because your king claimed some far off piece of land ? 
  it 's important to recognize that there are mechanisms in uk legislation to provide for peaceful and non-damaging secession . 
  this is because the uk dealt with the problem between the relevant , affected parties . 
  are you loyal to your prime minister or your parliament ? 
  your queen ? 
  your army ? 
  your school ? 
  your bar ? 
  nationalism falling out of favour has nothing to do with geography and everything to do with increased education , empowerment and representation . 
  that 's a factor , and i mean this sincerely , as much on one skilled professional performing a role as it is on the whole populace . 
  it 's not possible , nor is it advisable , to draft policies in a bubble . 
  second best thing for the yorkshire economy after leeds getting back into the premiership . 
  you have n't explained your point . 
  you are concerned about a people 's ability to self-govern ? 
  and we 've cottoned on to the dishonest flaw at the heart of what was the war on terror . 
  russia looks us-style to you ? 
  your mental gymnastics stagger me . 
  that 's kind of a vague arguement . 
  no what i meant was why was china insisting on changes to a model that had worked so well , and moreso one that had suceeded while their own attempts at creating financial centres had , presumably or by comparison , met with failure ? 
  what are you arguing here ? 
  the difference in circumstances between the two as relates to the eu is monumental . 
  for one , the us shares no borders with the eu . 
  for another , it has no history of belligerence against member states . 
  for a third , it is not a large energy supplier to the eu that has attempted to influence states through energy politics . 
  and russia is far less interested in human rights than the us , has a much worse record with corruption and the rule of law , and is far less stable economically . 
  this is not to say the us does n't have a slew of it 's own problems , but a comparison of the two in this situation bears this out . 
  you will never be at a stage where people do not have the ability to hurt each other , but to decry the most prosperous period in the world 's history because of the potential of the dominant superpower to commit a vaguely defined catastrophe is juvenile . 
  cgp grey ? 
  is there any reason for that ? 
  china has n't seen as much success as it would 've hoped in building a financial centre , i 'd imagine . 
  these are nothing new . 
  the only message to take from this article is that hilary is trying to cosy up to an eu she was previously cool on because she 's aware she will have to deal with it wyhen she wins her election . 
  you 've got a few wires crossed here . 
  the cost of manufacturing ( and the investment from russia for ) two * mistrals * is not insignificant . 
  the deal is high profile , and the negative backlash from reneging on it would be compelling and sustained . 
  russia is playing a long-term military game insomuch that it 's been in a prolonged process of updating it 's soviet-era armed forces since it 's shortcomings were displayed in 2008 . 
  there is zero chance that these warships will be used against any eu or nato nation , particularly in the short-term when worldwide scrutiny is on russia for it 's actions in ukraine and despite putin 's assurances to the contrary global ill-will is being felt . 
  compounding this is the precarious position of the russian economy , which is being softly strangled by both government actions and the fallout from that governments internal and international policies . 
  and thirdly russia is a nation that has to purchase flagship hardware from other states . 
  generally speaking , france , germany and the uk are a much more threatening force than the russian army . 
  edinburgh is an absolutely beautiful city with a wonderful setting , and has the bonus of being close enough to glasgow that you can nip over there for a day to appreciate just how good you have it . 
  that 's interesting , thanks for that . 
  you can renege on your deal at any time . 
  i 'm explaining to you why that is a bad idea . 
  if you are just arguing to hear me say `` russia is in the wrong '' , then yes , russia is in the wrong . 
  but in ten years time russia will still be there and i 'll still want their business . 
  and the appeal of singapore is essentially that it is closer to becoming hong kong than shanghai is ? 
  could you give the cliffnotes of what these are , for the unenlightened ? 
  i find this fascinating .
