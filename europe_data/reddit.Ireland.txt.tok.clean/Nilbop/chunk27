  i 'm not saying they were n't there , i 'm saying i ca n't speak to any of them . 
  this though :  and a large portion of the active military ( who are career military men ) joined the separatists . 
  sounds like complete ad-hoc nonsense . 
  have you got a source for it ? 
   it was also well before this that ukraine accused russia of supplying the separatists so why not assume that they supplied them with anti-aircraft weaponry ? 
  you 're going to have to spell this out clearer for me . 
  i find that interesting , as i 'd make exactly the same claim about your view , in that it seems far too narrow and far too based in your own circumstances . 
  but we 'll get nowhere fighting over this and i doubt i 'll have anything that will convince you about the movement of politics and civilization since the middle ages , so i 'll leave it at that . 
  what 's the opinion down south on mcaleese ? 
  i went to school with her kids , and always found her a bit fake , if allright . 
  her kids though , fucking hell ... 
  he looks like he should be narrating commercials for werther 's originals , or telling gandalf that he 's thinking of going on a journey . 
  addendum : we in the north absolutely * do * do this , even though we should n't . 
  hence the continued popularity of people like [ ** gerry `` big ger '' adams ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerry_adams ) and [ ** ian `` i 'm glad you 're dead you old fuckbag '' paisely ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ian_paisley ) . 
  how dare you talk about ** enda `` the line '' kenny ** like that . 
  he bestrides this world like a shining colossus , and we lesser men peep about in his shadow , to find for ourselves dishonourable graves . 
  ever since helle thorning-schmidt lost her job , at least . 
  this dude looks like the kid who leeched off the bullies in school . 
  that dude is handsome as fuck . 
  well he 'd win , because putin 's 5 foot nothing and this dude looks like satan himself , but i 'm not sure the prise would do either country any favours . 
  well yes mate , when you are attempting to disprove the accepted norm re : putin is a repressive dictator who suppresses political , media and social dissent , invades other countries and commands his own popularity polls , you have to prove your work . 
  that 's kind of an expectation of burden of proof , i 'm afraid . 
  being pragmatic and planning for your economic and societal success in the future has nothing at all to do with holding a river border in the age of the internet and icbms . 
  saying it 's necessary for the continuation of your state is absolute fearmongering . 
  * islands are different . 
  the term `` eastern europe '' honestly seems to fluctuate in relevance depending on how agitative russia has been recently . 
  it 's weird . 
  you 've got to understand that half of us are just lifting our eastern european history straight from * crusader kings 2 . 
  * including me . 
  is there any chance we could replace putin with tim the bear from * the cleveland show ? 
  * he 's got to have a lot of free time right now . 
  dropping pratchett on yo ' ass , puttin ' barcelona on blast, 
  you can shoot down a helicopter with a shoulder-mounted rocket-launcher . 
  hell , you can shoot out the cockpit with regular arms . 
  you simply ca n't do that at a plane flying over 32,000 feet . 
  this is why the us has such primacy with it 's air-force in afghanistan and iraq . 
  it 's just not even close to the same force projection and is n't indicative of it . 
  do n't lie to people , you mean a replay of august 2008 when the russian-backed separatists attacked the georgian army , [ starting the war  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-georgian_war )  as the soviet union weakened in early 1991 , the republic of georgia declared its independence . 
  amidst this backdrop , a 1991 -- 1992 war between georgia and separatists left parts of the territory of the former south ossetian autonomous oblast ** under de facto russian-backed and internationally unrecognised separatist control . 
  ** after the war was halted , a joint peacekeeping force of georgian , russian and ossetian troops was stationed in the territory . 
  meanwhile , a similar situation developed during 1992 -- 1993 in the georgian region of abkhazia . 
  after a prolonged lull , complex relations between georgia and russia began to worsen drastically in april 2008 . 
  ** ossetian separatists began shelling georgian villages on 1 august , ** with a sporadic response from georgian peacekeepers in the region . 
  the georgian army was sent to south ossetia on 7 august to defend civilians and restore order . 
  [ 30 ] most of tskhinvali , south ossetia 's capital , was recaptured in hours . 
  georgia later said it was also responding to russia moving non-peacekeeping units into the country . 
  gosh , it 's almost like they keep doing the same thing over and over or something . 
  this is such an outdated sentiment it boggles my mind that any adult , let alone the leader of a country , would subscribe to it , let alone wage * war * over it . 
  shooting down a helicopter at several hundred feet is not an indication that you can shoot down an aircraft at over 32,000 . 
  i do n't recall anything about a cargo plane , how did the reports say it was ? 
   they accused girkin of orchestrating the downing of mh17 . 
  to me that sounds like they accused him of deliberately taking down a civilian plane . 
  they 're saying he 's the one who gave the order , which may or may not be true . 
  i 'm not sure how incompetent you 'd have to be to mistake a helicopter flying at several hundred feet and a civilian airliner travelling at over 32,000 . 
  well , i guess i do know now . 
  this argument is n't as strong as you believe it to be . 
  well , then you wo n't mind this . 
  you tell me ; you keep disappearing for a day and then come back and complaining again . 
  you 've done nothing but display how far in the sand you 've buried your head , you 've failed to convince anyone of your absurdly ludicrous assertion that vladimir putin does n't interfere with his own popularity polls , i mean i 'm not sure when you want to call it quits , but let me know when you do so i can stop wasting time on a true-believer . 
  do n't feed the troll , please . 
  how did that happen , anyway ? 
  it 's valid in virtually every first world country . 
  weed is already ubiquitous . 
  legalize it , tax it , reap the benefits . 
  check out colorado since legalization : pros : lots of money cons : life feels pretty good, 
  they call themselves the doobie brothers . 
  oh i 'd never accuse you of having read a book . 
  everyone walks at their own pace . 
  they 're afraid we 'll force them to work to death in the sauna and meatball mines . 
  and we will . 
  ah here we go already !, 
  i do n't know anything about the poet or the subject matter , but that 's some heavy stuff right there . 
  i 'm guessing namedropping bandera did n't help him . 
  he probably should have just said banderas . 
  i mean , regardless of whether the often-rumoured plundered riches exist , we 'll probably never find out about it until long after he 's feeding the worms . 
  where did you read it is the obvious next question . 
  we 're looking for a source . 
  otherwise people could just say anything and then say `` oh , i read it somewhere . '', 
  there are more actual russians posting here than post in fucking / r/russia . 
  oh no it 's not that , it 's that the cause was of their own making instead something the west did to them . 
  do me a favour and post this in / r/russia so i can see / u/wearebrics shit herself in anger . 
  i love that you created an alt to say this . 
  ... so what ? 
  unless the president is legislating against your criticism and sending his goons to kill you for being a critic of him , that 's not a problem . 
  not like in russia . 
   ... exists only in your vivid imagination . 
  you 're out in space , buddy . 
  people from the island of great britain . 
  the long and short of it is that it is * absolutely worth breaking the law to get rich , * because once you * are * rich you are infinitely better protected from anything that happens to you . 
  literally murder a guy for his millions if you think you 'll get away with it , because you probably will . 
  i can hear the bass in the background of this comment . 
  what the fuck is even going on ? 
  what is this vote for ? 
  what was the last one for ? 
  yeah i know what i want in government is more talk about the poors needing to bootstrap their way out of poverty . 
  always happens in times of crisis . 
  that 's why we 've seen so many conservative governments since 2008 . 
  cheers , wall street . 
  or whoever . 
  i mean , you guys are generally pretty good at basketball .
