  this is the 3rd account you 've dedicated to this gimmick . 
  you know people do n't take you seriously ? 
  nicolas cage up in there ? 
  ca n't have a bonfire that big without nicolas cage . 
  the defining feature of the new budget will be the mandatory implementation of `` non-austerity metres '' in every home to monitor each household 's spending and tax them accordingly . 
  second . 
  25 % of fucking buffalo ticket and merch sales come from the gta , and we fucking * hate * buffalo . 
  toronto deserves a team more than half the cities in the league . 
  is there a short of rural swtizerland that * is n't * , like , achingly breathtaking ? 
  london gets more nfl games than toronto this year , and that good sirs is * bullshit * watch the nfl guys it 's seriously good, 
  the key thing is we already paid for water in taxation . 
  now they want us to pay through taxation * and * through meter charges . 
  because it 's enda . 
  it 's just a bit of fun , like, 
  expression of thanks, 
  it 's almost like they 're complete cunts or something . 
  we are not a photogenic people . 
  and you stick a fucking * history grad * on top of those people ? 
  just give the job to anyone then . 
  it 's autumn in paris . 
  where 's my upvote . 
  ah yes , george osbourne . 
  britain 's chancellor with a degree in modern history and zero financial experience . 
  let us all pause , take heed , and reflect upon the piercing truths issuing forth from his learned mouth . 
   complain about state of our military  putin would be proud of me somehow i doubt that . 
  i would imagine this to be the case . 
  i mean do n't many ukranians speak both languages anyway , even if they choose to speak one over the other ? 
  even forgiving that the list has huge problems . 
  i 'm biting my tongue just looking at cromwell sneaking in there at number 10 , nevermind a beatle being there . 
  the telegraph 's really been at it the past few days . 
  ** you have gained the following attributes : ** * nord +1 * * rus -1 *, 
   `` minister for gun-running , daylight robbery , and general mayhem '' this is tied with `` minister of partying down '' for most fun political title ever . 
  he 's charming , intelligent as hell , helped out in norn iron , and less importantly something something us economy and deficit something something . 
  people love bill , not hilary . 
  she spread her love around , did maggie . 
   # 3 diana , princess of wales . 
  really ? 
  the third best briton * ever ? 
  * ahead of william shakespeare , charles darwin and fucking isaac newton ? 
  andy murray would 've won this poll if you 'd taken it just after wimbledon . 
  he could shout and unite people behind him against an inhuman enemy , and that was also his problem . 
  he did the most for the uk certainly , but that does n't equate to popularity . 
  especially when you 've got the charismatic walking caricature just before him cameoing in half of every war movie ever made . 
  for someone who actually spent time as a politician , something something ** [ de valera ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89amon_de_valera ) ** something something ? 
  andorra 's sat there being all * damnit *, 
  be honest ; you just ran out of poses to put him in where it does n't look like he 's playing air guitar . 
  ** what are you planning . 
  the title was pretty good , but it was the accompanying picture of a random tidal flood that really made me giggle . 
  half my crappy village in northern ireland seemed to subsist on the dole , and then nip down south of the border for handouts from the south too . 
  so yeah , in norn iron at least you can absolutely live off it . 
  not well , but hell the state will find you a crappy house and then pay for you to do almost nothing as long as you tell them you 've checked a newspaper in bi-weekly meetings , so whatever . 
  calling the mail and sun newspapers is being obscenely generous . 
  they are the print equivalent of yahoo 's front page click-bait . 
  that would be a cool idea . 
  i 'm sensing a * slight * maritime trend . 
  the poles : a grand bunch of lads . 
  i 'm at the office and the explanatory . pdf wo n't open , but what 's the cliffnotes version of this ? 
  what does it involve ? 
  i 'm actually looking forward to this as indicative of a change in policy ; surely now they will stop support for the violent donetsk and lugansk people 's republic , which has resulted in many deaths and the isolation of russia politically . 
  yep , it 's a * guardian * article . 
  i can feel charlie 's sense of self-satisfaction from here . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  this is a throwaway curio and a joke . 
  i mentioned my education there because * that 's where i found out about it . 
  * i 'm not debating that it 's still legal to murder the welsh with impunity if you fulfill a certain set of circumstances , that should blatantly not be the case to anyone with a modicum of common sense . 
  if that upsets you then i 'm sorry , but do n't make fun of me so you can feel smug . 
  i ... assumed this was satire . 
  the gdp doubling over a period of 15 years does not mean the economy is not moribund ; investors are aware it 's an export-driven energy-based economy and are pulling out because of the actions of the putin government ( this is aside from the ongoing crisis in ukraine which has turned it into a pariah state ) . 
  people are unsure about investing , and russia has been shut out from eu banks to help deal with it 's debt . 
  hell , if russia 's gdp had n't improved since 1999 it would 've been indicative of massive , massive problems . 
  he probably meant me . 
  apparently admitting i did this is a huge faux pas . 
  that 's not indicative of what you think it is . 
  not to dampen your bizarre hate-boner but i 'm not bragging about anything , i was setting context for why i knew about the law in the first place . 
  it 's weird that you latched on the `` i studied law '' part . 
  and it 's absolutely something they tell you day one , week one , because it 's a humorous example of a bizarre local law that 's never been overturned . 
  my first interactions with southerners was them letting me know that i spoke like a scot because i said `` aye '' and `` lad '' all the time . 
  i studied law in chester . 
  it 's still legal to shoot a welshman with a longbow there if he 's caught within the city walls after midnight . 
  i 'm serious . 
  `` western '' ? 
  have people used this word so often they 've forgotten what it means or something ? 
  do romanians seriously use this term to separate themselves from others ? 
  well done you continentals . 
  this is a great symbolic gesture and coupled with german peacekeepers actually heading to region a strong show of support for ukraine 's peace process . 
   poland was better under communism aaaand i 've stopped reading and downvoted you . 
  it 's not a comforting thought that the only thing keeping us from plunging into another war is that not * everyone * in power is a complete fucking moron . 
  no , it 's not and no , it 's not . 
  in northern ireland it 's still pretty bad , but the main party that condemns it , the unionist dup , has been repeatedly shamed over the past decade with high-profile members being outed in a variety of sex-scandals involving gay masseuses and secret lovers , so they are n't as vocal as they used to be . 
  it never seems to be a problem for the nationalist parties . 
  that being said i think sustained , universal education and in particular the promulgation of the internet connecting people has done more for opening people 's tolerances than politics or legislation ever could . 
  did they perhaps misread them as * planetary * elections ? 
  yes . 
  it 's a revolving door of excuses ; we rely on nato because we ca n't stand on our own because we do n't need to upgrade spending because we rely on nato because ... 
  and now * she 's * spending all her time underground . 
  is there any chance of seeing some engaging non-oxbridge types in the big positions ? 
  what the fuck is the labour party doing in england to look this weak ? 
  i 'm aware historically scotland has voted left but this should n't equate to labour discounting it 's position in england . 
  you mean cork ? 
  because despite being depicted to the contrary professional politics is most closely resembles a game of football with both teams rabidly cheering themselves on until one scores a goal .
