  * `` we never should have fought nazi germany '' * - / u/9a4172 . 
  i want everybody to remember this is precesily the person advocating the stance of appeasement and cowardice towards dictatorships . 
  it 's absolutely apologists like this who allow atrocities to happen . 
  yeah , and saddam had weapons of mass destruction . 
  see that ? 
  that 's the humouring bit i was talking about . 
  that was me humouring you . 
  [ beg your pardon , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occupied_territories_of_georgia ) per the wiki they are merely [ violating an international ceasefire  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-georgian_war )  russian military occupies abkhazia and south ossetia in violation of the ceasefire since august 2008 . 
  yeah no , you thought russia was n't a dictatorship . 
  this is me humoring the helpless . 
  yeah , okay buddy . 
  the one that 's had the same guy in power since he first assumed the mantle over 16 years ago and with state-controlled media posting poll numbers that would make kim jong un blush . 
  that one . 
  the bigger dog realizes it 's the bigger dog , and the little dog backs off . 
  russians are n't going to die over georgia . 
  right now they do n't have to . 
  the flaw of appeasement rears it 's embarassing head again . 
  the russian army is debilitated and remarkably out of date . 
  it would absolutely never continue a conflict where it would have to come up against nato . 
  and yes , you demand russia remove their troops from occupying georgia , which the un has already declared illegal . 
  i 'm not sure why you are concerned about nato losing a slice of a member state to russia . 
  the bigger dog does not worry about what the little one will do . 
  i 'd like to think for the humanitarian ideals of deterring a dictatorship from unilateral aggression against defenseless neighbours . 
  yeah , no we do n't . 
  ** we want to deal with this fucking illegal immigrant problem . 
  ** but oh no !, 
  the left has ceded all discussion of this problem as even * existing * to the right , so now anyone who brings it up is going to be tarred and feathered !, 
  so now we get sensationalist headlines like this !, 
  in a lot of situations there are artificial limits , that 's before you even factor in how artificially inflated the cost of becoming one is . 
  well that 's fucking infuriating . 
  i 'm holding / u/dclauzel responsible for this . 
  careful now . 
  what happened to the indian flag ? 
  what 's georgia 's reason for never applying for nato membership ? 
  i suppose the russian-backed frozen-conflict in ossetia and abhkhazia ? 
  that 's a tactic they 're openly using to try and deny membership . 
  to be honest , that policy needs redress . 
   so circle jerking is n't necessarily a collective activity . 
  it 's kind of worrying how you do n't know what a lot of stuff means or , y' know , * is . 
  * but i mean , lead strong , right ? 
   first off all wikipedia is not a source , which is why i used quotation marks . 
  i 'm just going to reiterate that you do n't know how wiki works or what sources or citations are . 
  here 's a hint - they 're thing enormous lists at the bottom of every large article detailing all the different sources . 
  click on them !, 
  you 'll be amazed where they go !, 
   second of all , like i slimy pos oh come on you 're not slimy . 
   you misrepresented even that . 
  that wikipedia article you linked states : again , you do n't know what that word means . 
  i linked directly to the article while saying nothing about it . 
  i 'm not sure how that is misrepresenting in your book , but then it 's probably not * in * your book . 
   * ( two sources which support my protest ) * yup , thanks for reposting those , i guess . 
   so wikipedia , that rag that 's slang for a newspaper , buddy . 
   that any moron can edit , yup . 
   and that you would have people trust more than the report i presented published by the ippnw , trust many sources over one , a terrifying thought . 
  except i 'm not saying do n't trust them , i 'm saying * you 're wrong . 
  * i mean , that tastes harder going down and i 'm sure it 's tougher for you to defend , so that 's probably why you ca n't . 
   a nobel peace prize laureate organization , [ circa 1985 . 
  ] ( http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1985/physicians-facts.html )  has a more balanced presentation of the situation than you would like people to believe . 
  who 's arguing that the ippnw do n't give a balanced presentation of the situation ? 
  i 'm not arguing with them , i 'm arguing with your interpretation of their report . 
  do n't try and use them as a shield for your own slapdash opinions . 
   you chose to highlight the results of the iraq body count study and that of the iraq family health survey i chose to link a wiki article with over 200 sources . 
  i linked directly to * iraq civilian casualties * whose first subsection is * iraq bodycount project . 
  * the reason i did this is because you were talking about the uk killing [ `` iraqi muslims '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ck1lp/russia_vetoes_move_at_un_security_council_to/csw9mxc ) . 
  you just do n't comprehend the implication of your statements . 
  yeah , no , you 're trying to use the holodomor as a defence for saying the uk was slaughtering `` iraqi muslims . '', 
  that 's not only nonsensical , it 's downright fucking * bizarre . 
  `` this anti-austerity mandate gives me the mandate to implement these austerity measures '' , have i got that right ? 
  is there any other sensible choice at this point ? 
  all the polemics seem to have distracted from the fact that greece literally wo n't be able to repay the debt as it is . 
  it 's all fine and well shouting about what 's owed but if the debt ca n't be repaid without further work then just work on it lest you look like an idiot . 
  that 's nothing , i 'm currently talking to this guy that does n't know what a source is !, 
  he thinks wikipedia * itself * is the source because he 's never learned about citations or proper sourcing !, 
  can you * imagine * how shit he 'll be in university ? 
  alive people are unfairly represented in graveyards , i 'll have you know , and who is campaigning for * their * rights ? 
  the bowl of bronze cocks is just killing me . 
  i do n't think anyone is taking the yoga thing seriously . 
  and that 's brother nilbop of the sacred order of the shining spear talking . 
  i mean , they 'll still pay me if i do it ironically , right ? 
  here ( toronto ) too !, 
  somersby , ya'all . 
  i find government work is a steady enough option in the cases where you just want a good paying job that 's fairly secure . 
  in canada it 's upwards of $ 40,000 + per year for starting jobs ( administration , clerks ) and they 're more open than private businesses about accepting other nationalities and those with disabilities . 
  the work is n't hard and the atmosphere is very positive . 
  maybe it 's something to look into ? 
   ireland has a booming information and communication technology sector . 
  i mean , it really , really does . 
  i 'm not going to be so hyperbolic as to say you can walk out of university with an it/computer science degree and straight into a job , but it 's * close . 
  * if / u/malac0d4 is interested in a career in it - and it does n't bother his eyes - it pays well and is as secure as you can get . 
  i mean , ireland is n't as nice as italy or anything ... 
  i think that 's a bit hyperbolic . 
  on the one hand we have a student with a disability worried about his future , on the other hand we have corrupt or , at best , ultra-right demagogue politicians who already have their careers and lives made for themselves . 
  it 's hardly fair to call them the same . 
  i mean , say what you want , i thought she was hot . 
  i 'm just gon na link my response to your even stupider comment in this same thread :  we get it , you do n't know what sources are . 
   it 's cool . 
  lots of people do n't know stuff . 
  and then whoops there 's more  btw , if we were to go by that utterly imbecilic `` source '' of yours and only include as victims people that suffered direct deaths from military intervention , so you did n't read the source , then . 
  i mean , then you put source in quotation marks , so i do n't even know what to make of you . 
  you do n't know what sources are , but you also do n't believe in sources , or something ?
