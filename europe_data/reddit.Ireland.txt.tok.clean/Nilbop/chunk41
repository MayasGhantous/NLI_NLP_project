  they 'd lose all public faith virtually overnight . 
  like most times when putin speaks , i do n't get the impression he 's talking to his audience . 
  i get the impression he 's talking out the side of his mouth to nato . 
  which has been shown to be pretty pointless . 
  i think that 's a bit hyperbolic , but it 's definitely a type of outburst unique to putin-regime russia . 
  whether you want to allow it to affect your policy is up to you , i ca n't see stockholm being too concerned about this if they have their decisions already made . 
  no , i 'm good with not giving them a pass on that , thanks . 
  [ in his absence , i 'll posit that he was talking about this .

  [ this is probably what he was talking about .

  kinda feel like you 're doubling back . 
  kinda feel like you 're too proud to admit you were wrong . 
  but seeing as i 've already added these elsewhere anyway , here are [ two ] ( http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/sweden-confirms-russian-spy-plane-violated-airspace/articleshow/45513544.cms ) [ more ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20140918/russian-jets-violate-swedish-airspace-report ) instances of this happening within the past year . 
  he does n't consider ukraine or georgia a threat either , but that did n't seem to influence his decision to invade either state . 
  i mean , i 'm sure we 're all very , * very * tired of hearing that analogy , but it 's the kind of analogy that only needs to be right * once . 
  i know it 's tempting to be cynical but we , the citizens of these countries unfettered by the ties that politicians are bound by , should be the ones promoting loudest for international concern if we want to see that change take place , right ? 
  exactly . 
  compared to how severe they could - and should - be , this is a farcical gesture that is n't putting any pressure on anyone . 
  this is absolutely the forum where you should feel comfortable posting this stuff . 
  thanks for putting so much work into it . 
  seeing as he 's a citizen of the uk he does n't have to , he 's got a huge fucking army for just that purpose . 
  or was your intention just to kill that train of thought stone did with an absurd request ? 
  * is * the plan wrong ? 
  i 've no idea what is going on anymore . 
  oh god yeah , it 's a complete mess over here , and not just for the obvious reasons . 
  for one thing , me ( or my mp ) voting in belfast [ is given greater say over what goes on in london than anybody living in london gets . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_lothian_question ) it 's bananas . 
  a spade 's a spade , there 's nothing admirable in allowing yourself to be fooled . 
  what 's that ? 
  it 's the sound of a false equivalency i hear !, 
  you 're hanging your hat on the fact that you * know the name * of * one politician * who * has n't fled or been killed ? 
  i have no idea why anybody thinks i 'm arguing against this . 
  i 'm arguing * for * it . 
   plus , donating would n't antagonize russia so much that they would put missiles in kalingrad . 
  i do n't see how that works , to be honest . 
  instead of the hardware being essentially in storage , they 'd be in constant use . 
   boeltje ... possessions ? 
  i do n't language so good . 
  good lord i 'm so tired of the redditors who are just desperate to engage in hyperbole at the drop of a hat . 
  or a change in leadership precipitates a policy change . 
  the difference between the w. bush and obama administrations are particularly relevant in this comparison i think . 
  russia is a de-facto dictatorship though so this is n't going to happen in the kremlin . 
  for those not wishing to give into the imperialistic british vampire junta :  ** russia warned against an `` aggressive step '' by nato on monday after america proposed storing over 1,000 tanks and armoured vehicles in eastern europe . 
  **  ** nato countries along russia 's border , unnerved by the kremlin 's intervention in ukraine , have asked the alliance to deploy at least one brigade to protect their frontiers . 
  **  ** but nato signed an agreement with russia in 1997 forbidding the permanent stationing of combat forces anywhere east of germany , at least `` in the current and foreseeable security environment '' . 
  **  america is prepared to water down this commitment by storing the heavy weapons and equipment - but not troops - for one brigade , distributed among six countries in eastern europe . 
  these nations are understood to include estonia , latvia and lithuania , which are particularly exposed to russian aggression . 
   the plan would see about 250 abrams m1 main battle tanks from the us army `` pre-positioned '' in nato 's most vulnerable members - more than all the tanks possessed by the british army . 
   if approved by nato defence ministers later this month , this proposal would amount to the biggest counter-move by the alliance since the onset of ukraine 's crisis . 
   general yuri yakubov , a senior official in the russian defence ministry , condemned the `` most aggressive step by the pentagon and nato '' since the end of the cold war . 
  he told interfax news agency that if this plan went ahead , then ** `` russia would be left with no other option but to boost its troops and forces on the western flank '' . 
  **  one option would be for russia to `` speed up '' the deployment of iskander missiles in its enclave of kaliningrad , bordering poland and lithuania , added gen yakubov . 
  the iskander is a mobile ballistic missile capable of delivering either a conventional or a nuclear warhead . 
  last month , the russian armed forces said that a missile brigade in kaliningrad would be equipped with iskander-m missiles by 2018 . 
   ** toomas hendrik ilves , the president of estonia , told the telegraph in april that nato should send a combat brigade to defend his country and its baltic neighbours , latvia and lithuania . 
  **  at the time , the alliance 's only deployment in estonia was the temporary presence of one us infantry company with 150 troops . 
  `` one hundred and fifty soldiers is not a lot , so we do think that further stationing of troops at a higher number is only reasonable , '' said mr ilves . 
   the possible outcome is that estonia and other other vulnerable allies will host the heavy weapons of one us brigade , but not the troops . 
  along with 250 tanks , this will include about 1,000 other vehicles , including bradley personnel carriers and self-propelled artillery . 
   at present , america has no main battle tanks permanently stationed in europe : the last one left in 2013 . 
  the new plan would see us tanks moving back to europe in strength and on a permanent basis for the first time since the cold war . 
   in the event of hostilities , the baltic states fear that russia would cut off their overland links with the rest of nato , preventing the arrival of reinforcements . 
  by pre-positioning heavy weapons for one brigade , this danger could be reduced , particularly as troops could be flown in relatively quickly . 
   tomasz siemoniak , the polish defence minister , confirmed that talks were underway `` about the stationing of us military equipment in poland . '' he added : `` we have been working for a while on increasing the american military presence in poland and across the eastern flank of nato . ''  mr siemoniak said that any heavy weapons would remain in place for the long term . 
  `` this all adds up to a growing presence of us forces in poland , and heavy equipment is significant as it is durable . 
  ** if need be , it can be here for years or even decades . 
  this is not an ad-hoc response to a crisis . '' **  mr siemoniak added that a final decision on this plan would be taken `` soon '' . 
   the weapons would be stored in existing military bases in the countries concerned . 
  juozas olekas , the lithuanian defence minister , said that his government was `` working to facilitate the deployment and stationing of heavy us equipment - and we are willing to donate our military infrastructure to house it . ''  mr olekas added that lithuania was already preparing its `` military infrastructure '' to stockpile american heavy weapons , saying : `` it is almost ready . '' estonia has also allocated funds towards building barracks and extra military facilities for nato troops and equipment . 
  emphasis and therefore purposeful attempt to lead and mismanage your narrative is mine . 
  that 's applicable for half the posters in this thread who argue for moscow . 
  edit : yep , there 's thag downvote every anti-moscow post has gotten . 
  * at last !, 
  * they 're * so * bloody pointless !, 
  here in canada they got rid of them ages ago and the only difference is you do n't have tiny crappy coppers littering your wallet . 
   i think they are trying to provoke russia into ( formal ) open war ,  i think they still feel that most of the world is unsure whether ukraine is fighting russia or just an internal rebellion wow , uh , you 're on your own there . 
  i imagine if ukraine and romania have blockaded transnistria they 've also enacted a no-fly zone to enforce that blockade . 
  auntie has been given an agenda to push and apparently somewhere in the upper echelons is * `` having a go at those uppity scots for complaining about that devo max promise . 
  unlike scotland . 
   france wait , / u/dclauzel is * french ? 
  and do n't want anything to do with people like these . 
  to be honest that 's not prejudice so much as pragmatism . 
  well if he does n't , who the fuck will ? 
  he 's just a troll . 
  in the other thread he 's calling the british `` vermin '' and elsewhere he 's going off about ukraine . 
  just report him . 
   environmentalists in hungary are hoping the european commission will scupper a $ 12.5 bn ( # 9bn ) hungarian-russian deal to build two new 1,200 megawatt ( mw ) reactors at the paks nuclear power station on the river danube . 
   the expansion , they argue , will produce expensive energy , far beyond market prices , plunge hungary into debt , and deepen dependence on russia . 
   the government also defends its decision to make the contracts for the new reactors secret for 30 years . 
   months earlier he struck a deal with russian president vladimir putin that saw russia agree to loan hungary around 80 % of the estimated construction cost of the new reactors at paks . 
  hungary will pay russia back from the electricity generated . 
   by the time hungary has to start paying for this next generation of reactors , in 2025 , mr orban should be in comfortable retirement . 
   nevertheless , the decision to sign a deal with russia took even his own fidesz party by surprise . 
  built by the soviet union in the 1980s , the working life of the four existing reactors at paks will run out between 2032 and 2037 . 
  that means that no new decision on replacing them would actually be necessary until 2020 at the earliest . 
  there 's a lot more but geez , this whole deal stinks . 
  oh wow , i did n't know that . 
  yeah that 's pretty suspect . 
  anything that contributes to a stabilizing influence between the balkan states , to be honest .
