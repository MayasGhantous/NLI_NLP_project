  kremlin-funded group calls for act to destabilize the dominant power in europe . 
  shocker . 
  i 'm going to swing for the fences here : it 's pronounced pan *** tey *** on , right homies ? 
  i mean , that 's better than the normal cause being * `` everybody 's slowing down to look at a particularly gruesome car crash . 
   let 's cut to the quick on this :   your argument then is that the ukrainian army , trained to use and operate these aa guns and `` anticipating a russian invasion '' then failed to identify a plane in their own airspace flying from west to east ? 
    instead of a bunch of farmers and flint-knappers shooting it down ? 
  no , `` we all '' - * we , the great reddit hive-mind you have heroically pitted yourself against * - suspect that because the circumstances and evidence available bears it out and because it makes more logical sense . 
  you can attempt to spin an outcome borne from reason all you want , but the reason that you ca n't smother it is because it is the most sound , likely one . 
  * `` god , i wish i was n't being sent to die for this crazy fucking bastard 's political career . 
  well , of course he would . 
  nobody with an ounce of conscience would allow russia or qatar to retain their world-cup hosting privileges . 
  this is a tired apology that holds no ground . 
  nevermind the fact that everybody knows where putin is coming from ( re : a kgb cold-war-era mindset in the body of a corrupt politician using fear and ultranationalism to solidify his rule and distract from moribund economic practices and civil liberty abuses ) - if it works one way it must work the other : why does n't * putin * care about where ukraine is coming from , and how it has suffered , as the rest of the ussr client-states suffered , under his rose-tinted arcadia that was the soviet union ? 
  the odds of it being anyone other than the people we all suspect it being are * so * astronomically small you 'd need to be face-fucking the hubble to see them . 
  there 's a point where cautionary reports become dilution and distraction , and that point on the mh17 narrative came a long time ago . 
  let 's cut to the quick on this : your argument then is that the ukrainian army , trained to use and operate these aa guns and `` anticipating a russian invasion '' then failed to identify a plane in their own airspace flying from west to east ? 
  instead of a bunch of farmers and flint-knappers shooting it down ? 
  grats for poland . 
  i mean , come on , that 's some good news for them , right ? 
  there 's no reason to be all defensive over this . 
  i know context is important but i prefer to treat this as an obscure polish idiom i 've just discovered . 
  * `` oh , the english are coming ? 
  peh , it will be as the old saying goes - the piss will stain our monuments . 
  ** it 's an outside investigation you fat , amoral fuckstain . 
  does it really matter to anyone whether they admit it or not at this point ? 
  they 've got * zero * credibility anymore because of this . 
  it 's like the kremlin is auditioning for movie-villain status . 
  `` we are tired about all these stories of our army dying in ukraine * so the next person to mention goes in the sodomy hole . 
  i 'm not sure how you 're conflating a criticism of the church 's hypocrisy in buggering little boys while decrying marriage equality with a hitler analogy but here we are , talking about godwining the thread . 
  i appreciate that the artist resisted the urge to draw us in green - oh . 
  careful now , / u/ian56 is a stay-at-home billionaire who made his fortune on the stock market . 
  as his keen posting form has shown he has not just infinite resources but an implacable mind with which to wage glorious information war . 
  '' ... he hopes . '', 
  believing in a thing does n't necessitate going to a giant marble palace to chant in groups and eat a wafer . 
  this was n't the pope , this was a cardinal . 
  so are a lot of us , we 're just not all up in everybody 's shit about it . 
   meanwhile in the z\u00fcrich press conference , fifa spokesman walter de gregorio : `` the president ( sepp blatter ) is not involved , how can you say he has to step down ? 
  he is the president , if he is re-elected then he is the president for the next four years . '', 
  jesus christ i want to choke that obtuse fuckwit with my bare hands . 
  i ... see . 
   no , the new russia looks more like a copy of a totalitarian state from europe 's dark past , dressed in 21st century clothing . 
   `` when you hear the word fascism you always have to ask yourself : what are they talking about , how are they using the word ? '' oxford university professor roger griffin , one of the world 's foremost scholars of fascism , once warned in a 2012 interview . 
  `` the word ` fascist ' can be a simple way of insulting somebody , of saying that they are horrible , nasty , that they should go away . ''  indeed , it 's a favorite epithet of none other than vladimir putin , whose surrogates in the russian leadership alternately accuse the government in ukraine of either associating with fascists or actually being fascist . 
   what we have here , though , may be an example of what mental health professionals call projection . 
  i mean , pretty much , yeah . 
  is there any evidence of this happening in norway ? 
  anyone remember that episode of * the tick * where they went to antwerp and battled this fiddle-playing hobo whose plan was to become king of all belgium ? 
  i miss that show . 
  he looks like he 's waving . 
  what a friendly fellow . 
   `` i have clear views about the importance of international justice , which we need to expand , and britain pulling out of the european court will send all the wrong signals on the british commitment to expanding human rights around the world , '' mr mitchell said . 
   it comes as the snp , which is now the third biggest party in parliament , said it had begun sounding out lawyers on the tory benches about uniting to defeat mr cameron 's plans . 
  hooray for the snp , then . 
  asking the most corrupt and amoral body in the world to strip russia of it 's world cup is , while understandable , probably not going to go anywhere . 
  nonsense . 
  politically , educationally and militarily the world is much more peaceful and prosperous now than it has been at any point in it 's history , and that 's due to the march of progress , temperance and education .

  updated with a forward by david mitchell . 
  welcome to ireland , where the streets are paved with roads . 
  yeah i mean , it 's just the head of state and head of government . 
  you often get david cameron mixed up with the queen , right ? 
  yeah [ it 's kind of an issue , ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_nationality_law ) and at least part of that is due to us in the north . 
  why are you linking that ? 
  you said he was the prime minister of the czech republic right ? 
  should n't you be showing us your clearly in-depth knowledge of that instead ? 
  aside from anything else , can we all at least agree that izmir is a freaking awesome name ? 
  it sounds like some crazy fantasy city . 
  terrible to hear , but also not terribly surprising . 
  is he sponsored by * army of two ? 
  glad to hear of the tory 's continued commitment to europe , but i rather get the impression he knows he 's not going to get far with these reforms and is just using it to buy time . 
  hopefully till all the old anti-eu biddies die off . 
  sure the oul dears at the polling booth need a break , so . 
  let 's put it like this , if it does n't it 's going to be entirely down to lack of engagement by the youth vote . 
  too late , jeremy . 
  just drive you lazy halions it 's 2 hours to belfast . 
  i think some people still forget this : the * whisper * is a satire , people . 
   ca n't wait to taste irish food i do n't think i 've ever seen these words in this order before . 
  if you perceive everyone as an enemy and every action as a slight , nobody will care . 
  you can probably broaden that to include any activities that could possibly not be in favour of the putin administration 's goals , at this point or at any other point in time . 
  god i miss that show . 
  i ca n't believe they ended it after only 9 years , and that no seasons past that ever existed . 
  ever .

  actually , we 'd be describing an army of the eu . 
  considering the interests of the union ought to be protected from backward autocracies like the putin regimes which are only looking out for themselves to the detriment of us , this is something that 's been a long time coming . 
  are n't they still holding that estonian border agent ? 
  27k feels * way * above the average in certain areas , definitely in norn iron . 
  do what this norn ironer did : get your degree , maybe a postgrad or a little experience , then emigrate the fuck to canada . 
   they were minding their own business fighting the chinese are you kidding me with your logic here . 
  well aside from it being an oversimplification for no reason , it also takes blame away from the empire of japan . 
  i think when you use a broad descriptor to describe a negative event then people will get upset about it , regardless of it 's accuracy . 
  white people started world war two . 
  see the inferences you can draw from that ? 
  yeah , that 's pretty correct . 
  this is sort of * not * that though . 
  * so embarrassing . 
  i drink cider , so somersby from denmark .
