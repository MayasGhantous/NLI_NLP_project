   islamophobia has to be something against people . 
   otherwise if it was for ideologies , all pork eater would be transgressors . 
  i 'm not sure i follow you here . 
  i think you 're doing a solid job of interpreting a fluff piece that was only ever intended to attract people to the polling stations . 
  how many parties have offered voter reform and actually carried through with it ? 
  if you 're in a position to carry out reform , you 'd be dismantling the system that brought you into power . 
  there would pretty much have to be a major reason to shift the voting away from thursdays , even if the reason for keeping it does n't hold the traction it once did . 
  if it ai n't broke , do n't spend shoe-leather fixing it . 
  * vote for a public schooled aristocrat * day . 
  oh dude you should get it , daredevil is great . 
  not sure if trolling or genuine wankshaft . 
  [ a bunch . 
  ] ( http://be.brussels/about-the-region/international-brussels/international-institutions-in-brussels ), 
  the young skew liberal because they 're optimistic , the old skew conservative because they 're scared . 
  nothing new here apart from the improvements in the education system making the youth smarter than they ever were . 
  copyright reform !, 
  that 'll be the day . 
  everybody and their dad was a king in ireland before * the incident . 
  * i 'm sure there 's got to be a couple of ua neil 's sitting under some mountain somewhere waiting with their stick of slaying to overthrow * somebody * and lead us to * somewhere . 
  guarded by two eagles under mount snowdon . 
  * ooooh , * not * two eagles !, 
  serious question , because it 's on every curriculum : how dated is ** kes ? 
  ** the guard ** gets it down . 
  everything else , bang on . 
  ** intermission ** too . 
  say what you want , thon 's a quare handsome fella . 
  * why does the egg sqeauk as it runs . 
  * this has bothered me for * years . 
  it 's honestly like that all over . 
  it 's a very weird language . 
  til / u/horg has giant fucking balls . 
  tintin is my favourite french fictional character . 
  dude , do n't engage with one of the regulars from / r/russia . 
  it 's just a madhouse for ultra-nationalist idiots . 
  back to / r/russia with you . 
  people appreciate your fascist nonsense there . 
  what a ludicrous argeument . 
  patents . 
  * patents * for fuck 's sake . 
  it 's almost like it benefits us to help each other or something . 
  i 'd say it 's a narrative spun to sell papers and page-clicks , and the result is never going to be in doubt . 
  not the uk , the tiresome brexit non-story that 's sued to sell papers and page-clicks . 
  oh good , this again . 
  yes we are sort of closely identified with the noble potato . 
  the idea that moscow has pitched `` a country has different ethnicities ! '', 
  as some sort of urgent narrative for even * talking * about secession is one of the most embarassing continuing narratives in this whole debacle . 
  nah it 's nothing to do with the movie . 
  i can see you 've enjoyed potato-based celebrations before . 
  and then call you out as a russophobe when you call him out on it . 
  not a lot of logic going on there . 
  yes it 's pure unbridled rage 24/7 around here . 
  it 's not calling bad politics out for being bad politics , oh no , we just all hate those damn russian men , women and children so much we ca n't stand it . 
  upon every soil where the potato roots grow strong sits our kingdom . 
  in honour of this auspicious day , i present you with the * potato of celebration . 
  as opposed to them just dissappearing , though . 
  i assume it 's contextually to do with the fact that we 're remote from just about everyone and anyone who would try to attack us would generally have to attack the uk as well . 
  speaking as a northerner most irish defense leagues are concerned with defending ireland from other irish . 
  no , nobody 's wondering that . 
  how 's that vancouver housing bubble working out for you ? 
  and all that superior quality potassium . 
  asia 's like * what 's a immigent *, 
  is there a direct russian equivalent of wilson fisk ? 
  wherever you are , whatever you do , remember : ** do n't ** train your guinea pig to use heavy arms and entrench him in an active combat zone . 
  just do n't do it . 
  dear god estonia have a bigger military than us . 
  this is the most politics thing i 've heard all day . 
  legitimate question then - in that case why is that crescent moon on every flag and used as a symbol of islam ? 
  i have no idea what you are even arguing anymore . 
  we 're not all curly-haired gingers * damnit . 
  living in toronto - ** i know . 
  it 's never likely together allowed by the big 3 even if it managed to eventually fit the entrance criteria because , much like turkey , it 's influence would completely change the way the eu functions and sets policy . 
  even though there 's a lot of hyperbole here - modern germany has n't got it nearly as bad as east germany under the soviets or germany under goebbels or even modern russia as far as political accountability and media censorship goes - it 's important that we remember this state of affairs is only maintained by our constantly demanding they account for themselves and respect our rights over them . 
  tl ; dr - complacency is the enemy of integrity and progress . 
  aw man , that 's really heartening to see . 
   what was the scale of the rapes ? 
  the most often quoted number is a staggering 100,000 women in berlin and two million on german territory . 
  that figure - hotly debated - was extrapolated from scant surviving medical records . 
  jesus christ , 100,000 in the city alone ? 
  that 's an insanely high number . 
  you * should * be afraid , i * am * irish . 
  would n't appropriate response be a fine thing ? 
  god dude i 'd just love to sink a pint buck-naked in the middle of a snowstorm . 
  i mean if the snowstorm 's in downtown oslo then great but i 'd love to do it wherever . 
  the us has zero ships within non-allied maritime borders . 
  why should china , with a far inferior navy and equally if not more remote from us , be allowed to project their power within our borders ? 
  is there much support for this ( excepting the 50,000 who signed the petition , obviously ) ? 
  i assumed both countries were fairly content to continue on their own ways . 
  within the boundaries of the eu there 's virtually no non-ethnic distinction or borders between them anyway , right ? 
  it 's like glenn beck , except with government backing . 
  we all knew what this was going to be before we even clicked on it . 
  china has a right to protect it 's maritime * borders , * which are heavily contested in east asia . 
  it has zero right to interfere with eu maritime borders . 
  it will make precisely zero difference to my life either way . 
  always humorous seeing you have to deal with people you ca n't ban . 
   whose gimmick , not who is gimmick . 
   was he was  was he was ? 
  so he was , so he was ? 
   english is your native language , mate , the language we gifted you centuries ago . 
   if you 're going to try and insult us in our own language , at least learn how to speak it beforehand . 
   you really live up to your flair .
