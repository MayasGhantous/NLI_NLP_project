  avoid  are you sure you want to do this all over again ? 
  / u/rasing is the alt account of banned account / u/belnui who 's gimmick was he was exclusively bigotted against irish people . 
  i assume because he thinks it 's the 19th century ? 
  er , you 've created a fascisitic pit of reactionary ultranationalists ? 
  i 'm not sure how you expected anyone to react but uh calling you out on it is pretty mild . 
  we do n't send ships to their borders . 
  russia being a beligerent state is ** beside ** my point and ** contrary ** to yours . 
  having a centralized structure for our military would of course help this . 
  no worries . 
  cheers for the links . 
  this does n't seem `` brainwashed '' though . 
  i mean it 's fine , i guess . 
  i think we 're getting distracted . 
  careful now , you 'll hurt yourself with wit that cutting edge . 
  did ... did you read your link ? 
   this online supplement is produced and published by rossiyskaya gazeta ( russia ) , which takes sole responsibility for the content . 
   both sides are brain washed . 
  seriously ? 
  the difference between those links ( one a [ kremlin mouthpiece ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rossiskaya_gazeta ) , the other a [ french news site ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euronews ) that covers europe-wide activities ) is * staggering * in it 's partisanship . 
  huh , i honestly did n't know that . 
  that 'd be a concern then , although i do n't think a grievous enough one to overturn the notion given the plight of ukrainians right now . 
  are they ? 
  got a link ? 
  there 's zero difference between that and illegal travel between ukraine and poland/romania as it is except proximity to other countries . 
   he said he wanted visa-free travel to the entire schengen zone , not only poland and romania . 
  he 's unlikely to get that , then . 
   even if it was limited to poland and romania only the western-european countries would n't accept it , because poland is part of schengen . 
  if it 's restricted to poland and romania then by definition schengen access has been witheld as a prerequisite of issuing the visas . 
  i ca n't see moscow being terribly keen on allowing their citizens to travel at will to the eu . 
  considering it would be limited to poland and romania and implicitly given as war-time aid i do n't see a problem with it . 
  exceptions are made all the time . 
  per the undead zombie vampires at reuters ( emphasis mine ) :  china and russia have held naval drills in pacific waters since 2012 . 
  the may maneuvers come as the united states ramps up military cooperation with its allies in asia in response to china 's increasingly assertive pursuit of maritime territorial claims . 
   ** a total of nine ships from the two countries will participate , ** including vessels china now has on anti-piracy patrols in waters off somalia , chinese defence ministry spokesman geng yansheng told a monthly news briefing . 
   `` the aim is to deepen both countries ' friendly and practical cooperation , and increase our navies ' ability to jointly deal with maritime security threats , '' geng said . 
   ** `` what needs saying is that these exercises are not aimed at any third party and have nothing to do with the regional situation . 
  '' **  geng gave no specific date for the drills , which will be focused on navigation safety , at-sea replenishment , escort missions and live fire exercises . 
   since western powers imposed economic sanctions on russia last year over the violence in ukraine , moscow has accelerated attempts to build ties with asia , africa and south america , as well as warming relations with its former soviet-era allies . 
  ( that last line seems particularly ill-chosen ) . 
   china and russia are both permanent members of the u.n. security council and have close diplomatic , economic and military ties , with china traditionally relying on russia for its most advanced equipment . 
   china has been increasingly flexing its military muscles since xi assumed the presidency in 2013 , jangling nerves around the region and globally , though beijing insists it is a force for peace and threatens nobody . 
   china 's navy has become a focus of xi 's efforts to better project the country 's power , especially in the disputed south china sea . 
   china says about 90 percent of the 3.5 million sq km ( 1.35 million sq mile ) south china sea is its sovereign territory . 
  the philippines , taiwan , malaysia , brunei and vietnam also claim large parts . 
  as innocuous as this seems , i 'd find it hard to believe this would happen if the eu had a large , centralized military . 
  while russia is going to fall away on the global stage sooner or later , emerging or nascent superpowers like china and india , as well as the states , are going to be able to dictate terms to a fractured and small europe made up of several former powers and disinterested nation states . 
  this is exactly why greater unity and federalization under terms that benefit us all should be our long term goals . 
  they 're literally part of the same orchestrated push by on belligerent in an invasion . 
  i 'm not sure how you ca n't equate them both as being equally shameful , if not equally bloody . 
  look let them have this one . 
  edit : wow , he downvoted me . 
  someone 's salty . 
  i 'm willing to bet you literally every single dollar i own that not only will you not meet a tyrannosaurus the next time you go outside , you wo n't ever meet one for the rest of your life . 
  now are you willing to bet everything with me that we wo n't see more russian soldiers , arms and armaments push into ukraine as a result of this military build-up ? 
  did n't know that . 
  well then replace * `` dastardly lithuanians '' * with * `` beloved norse super-men . 
  i can already hear bono craftind a middling-to-poor ballad in response . 
  this is literally every russian thread now . 
  the first handful of posts are invariably * certain people * throwing out `` oh russians are inhuman '' or repeating the word putler and then shamelessly attacking anyone actually dealing with the article . 
  / r/worldnews has gotten particularly bad with it . 
  not / u/russia under / u/wearebrics head-in-bum bad , of course , but then you might as well shut the reddit down when it gets as bad as that dude 's forum . 
  for those who do n't want to support the dastardly lithuanian media-empire , emphasis mine :  russian ships are consistently interfering with a strategic energy project of lithuania that is laying down an electricity link under the baltic sea to connect its grid with sweden 's . 
   ** sources have told delfi that russian ships have appeared for the fourth time this month on the site of the cable laying works in the baltic sea . 
  **  ** the lithuania side received a notice from the russian ships on thursday with instructions to move out of the cable laying zone until 6 pm . 
  the russians said the place was chosen as a site for military exercise . 
  ** he said lithuania had sent three protest letters to moscow since march over similar actions . 
  no response was received . 
  **  `` this is completely unacceptable and in violation of the united nations law of the sea convention , '' the minister said to delfi . 
   linkevi\u010dius also told the bns news agency that he will summon the russian ambassador to lithuania over the incident . 
   the nordbalt link project , worth eur 550.3 m , is managed by litgrid , lithuania 's state-owned electricity company . 
  the aim of the project is to connect the country 's electricity grid to scandinavia . 
   the cable between lithuania and sweden is scheduled to be put into operation by the end of this year . 
  the 450-kilometre underwater connection will have a capacity of 700mw . 
  this is embarassingly petty stuff and a pretty galling picture of how moscow mistakenly believes it can influence it 's neighbours private dealings . 
  they 're so ... 
  the key issue is that the two major military powers in europe , the uk and france , both have and will support each other over these disputes because they both have vested interests in south american territory . 
  it has major trading , diplomatic and military ties with the uk and france which both have vested interests in this . 
  aside from the fact that the uk could happily stop any invasion on it 's own , the added threat of us assistance is a happy disuasion to any upjumped politician escalating to invading the uk 's territory in the first place . 
  step 1 : threaten all eu member states with military action . 
  step 2 : ???? 
  step 3 : assume eu has dissolved and be proud of mastery of diplomacy . 
  it 's nice that you think lucifer can tell thatcher what to do . 
  is that a thing ? 
  that sounds kind of interesting . 
  * cough * offshore oil fields * cough *, 
  i 'm sure most do n't but there 's a loud minority of shitbirds who spout this at every opportunity . 
  / r/russia is bursting at the sides with them . 
   they 're building a base in venezuela , really ? 
  huh , never heard of that . 
  of course it could . 
  there were many days when belfast was in danger of turning into this . 
  thankfully , as several baltimore representatives attested to yesterday , this is a socio-economic issue , and in cities like belfast where the standard of living has improved over the decades it 's much * less * likely . 
  the dup are pretty much ukip , they 've just been around longer so they 're respected instead of ostracized as bigotted , homophobic , idiotic ultrareligious nutjobs . 
  source : dated one . 
  that 's mr biased partisan asshole . 
  yeah . 
  that or because they 've seen his posts , but sure , they should be listening to me because * obviously . 
  seems like a reasonable arguement .
