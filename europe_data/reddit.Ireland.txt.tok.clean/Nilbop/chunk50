  sounds legit . 
  you have no idea what you 're saying , do you . 
  geneva it is . 
   if there is a submarine in the waters , then it is n't necessarily the russians . 
  if it is so obvious that russia is getting punished as a result of this submarine ( which is n't necessarily the case ) , then you could put the blame on the side that wants russia punished , meaning in that scenario it is more likely to be an allied submarine than a russian one . 
  this is some incredible mental gymnastics . 
  that name 's far too pedestrian to be finnish . 
  chester ? 
  as a completely noin-techsavvy luddite , what would this change mean for us all in layman 's terms ? 
  for those who do n't want to support the leftist british lizardocracy :  ukrainians stood up in the frigid cold of a kiev winter more than one year ago -- facing arrest , truncheons and ultimately a hail of bullets -- with concrete goals in mind . 
  the revolution was , at its core , an affirmation of the european values of fairness and the rule of law . 
  it was a fight for transparent democracy , accountability for public officials and an end to the rampant corruption that has plagued our country . 
   the former system of governance in ukraine , in which public officials and prominent businesspeople operated under the table and above the law , shut us off from the rest of europe . 
  for europe , with all its existing problems and challenges , has codified a system of checks and balances and a system of laws . 
  europe represents ukraine 's future . 
   my recent decision to dismiss the governor of the dnipropetrovsk region , ihor kolomoiskiy , is indicative of this drive to prevent the inappropriate influence of private interests on the state . 
  the rule of law is of utmost importance in the new ukraine , and there is no longer any tolerance for actions that undermine equality before the law . 
  public officials and large business owners are regular citizens like pensioners , students , workers , and small businessmen , in fact , just like everybody else . 
  those accused of abuse of power , corruption , or other offences are subject to the law regardless of their personal connections or wealth . 
   viktor shokin , our general prosecutor , has said as much , stating that there are no untouchables in ukraine -- not even the prime minister or president . 
  this is why we are already seeing arrests and charges against those suspected of misconduct or the misuse of public office . 
  investigations into the business activities of other powerful oligarchs are under way . 
  a number of high-ranking civil servants were also recently detained on corruption charges . 
  state enterprises now have to disclose their financial data for independent audit , which will eradicate the rampant corruption that permeates this sector . 
   but we can not simply push our way to justice . 
  justice is not the revenge of new authorities over previous administrations . 
  justice is blind to the untouchables , whether they are from the old or new authorities . 
  the road forward is still long , but we 've already started . 
   despite new legislation that launched judicial reforms in february , earning the praise of the venice commission , an advisory body of the council of europe , much remains to be done to entrench the rule of law in the courts . 
  the newly adopted reforms to ukrainian law ensure the right to a fair trial , change the rules relating to the selection of judges , return authority to the supreme court and establish transparent rules on the bodies responsible for judicial appointments . 
  the list of disciplinary penalties and the grounds for disciplinary liability has been extended . 
  the procedure for assessing judges ' qualifications has been introduced for all judges without exception . 
  a judge will have to undergo a qualification assessment -- a professional exam -- and abide by anti-corruption legislation . 
  in addition , a constitutional commission has been formed to craft constitutional amendments to make ukraine a decentralised state that enshrines the rule of law and offers its citizens the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time frame . 
   we are also making it easier to run businesses in ukraine . 
  we have significantly reduced ( from 56 to 38 ) the number of business activities that are subject to licensing . 
  registration of a legal entity can now be done online and a new head of the anti-corruption bureau has been appointed this month . 
  we are introducing a total change of the rules of the game -- there will be no obstacles for entrepreneurs who play fair . 
   post-independence ukraine has often failed to match the promises made to its citizens and the international community . 
  despite a particularly challenging environment , the new ukraine is determined to live up to its obligations . 
  ukraine will push forward on its path to the european union in spite of the many obstacles . 
  pretty much what you 'd expect . 
  reaffirming the pro-eu goals of ukraine and a little bit of explanation of the changes his administration has enacted , some apologism for struggles yet to come . 
  the comments are exactly what you 'd expect . 
  at last the long nightmare is over . 
  summary of article : events have consequences . 
  thanks for the page click . 
  want to get back to us after another year of russia arming an increasingly aggressive and coordinated contra movement or can we make a decision now ? 
  because that is the * only * change more waiting has shown . 
  absolutely . 
  tiptoeing around a problem and taking these half-measures helps nobody but moscow who have been banking on * precisely this response * from day one . 
  a vague and ludicrous fear of russian reaction that paralyzes the more powerful eu . 
  it 's an absurd status quo and it needs to end . 
  * `` i 'm furious this document apparently debunks my pre-conceived propaganda-based opinions and refuse to read it . 
  some of us have been calling for that for a while now . 
  ** seventeen ** battletanks and ** sixty ** apcs ? 
  are you fucking serious , moscow ? 
  they just dug these things out of the snow , fell ass-over-face and suddenly knew how to pilot and coordinate tanks and armoured personnel carrierrs ? 
   to my knowledge the eu does n't have a military so who is going to make up this peacekeeping force then ? 
  putting a force together from nothing takes too long for what ukraine needs i think ? 
  [ the eu battlegroups ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eu_battlegroup ) are the obvious response to a desire for small-mid-size peacekeeping forces . 
  i suppose you could argue for detachments from national militaries for aid but that seems less likely and much more like overkill . 
  you do n't need tank battalions for peacekeeping missions . 
   would make more sense to go to the un , which has an armed peacekeeping force and organizational structure in place as you said , that 's not happening while russia 's sitting on the unsc . 
  that 's the un for you . 
   also it would force russia to take a definite stance instead of outwardly saying `` we support ukraine 's territorial integrity '' on one hand and then on the other warning the us about escalation with weapon sales that 's another obvious benefit . 
  they idea of russia escalating against an eu peacekeeping force is complete jingoism and fear-fantasy . 
  forcing them to cease military-aid and pull out of ukraine will prevent this bloody contra-style conflict of theirs from dragging on for years . 
   once russia places the veto then the us does n't have to listen to `` let 's not escalate '' any more because russia will have taken their stance i 'm not sure what you mean by this . 
  for those not wanting to give the beeb the advertising money that they do n't get anyway :  eu leaders are in talks with ukraine 's president petro poroshenko covering trade and peace efforts , as heavy shelling intensifies in the east . 
   eu commission president jean-claude juncker and european council president donald tusk are at the kiev talks . 
   ukraine wants eu peacekeepers to help enforce a ceasefire agreed with pro-russian rebels . 
  but the eu is reluctant to engage in such a mission . 
   international observers report intense shelling near the city of mariupol . 
   on sunday tank and mortar rounds pounded shyrokyne , a village held by government forces near mariupol , a strategic government-held port city . 
   the osce observers said it was the most intense shelling since fighting began in the area in mid-february . 
   heavy weapons including tanks were spotted in rebel-held areas nearby , the osce said . 
  such weapons were supposed to have been pulled back under the truce agreed in february . 
   the kiev talks are the first between mr poroshenko and eu leaders since a key eu-ukraine association agreement was signed last june . 
   a joint press conference is expected at 16:15 local time ( 13:15 gmt ) . 
   the eu agreed to delay implementing the deal with ukraine until january 2016 , in response to russian complaints . 
   russia is suspicious of the agreement , arguing that free trade could turn ukraine into a conduit for cheap goods flooding into russia . 
   the eu is anxious for ukraine to enact far-reaching economic reforms to tackle unsustainable debts , inflation and widespread corruption . 
   reform of the heavily subsidised energy sector is a priority , bbc economics expert andrew walker says , as energy inefficiencies are a big drain on the national budget . 
   but peace and stability are the short-term priorities for ukraine , he says . 
   the heavily armed rebels refuse to recognise kiev 's authority and the west accuses russia of arming them and sending in regular soldiers . 
  russia denies that , insisting that any russians on the rebel side are `` volunteers '' . 
   mr poroshenko says eu or un peacekeepers are needed to ensure proper monitoring of frontline areas and the rebel-controlled border between russia and ukraine 's donetsk and luhansk regions . 
   `` in the buffer zone unarmed osce employees today have great difficulty performing their duties , '' he told the private ukraina tv channel . 
  this is really good news if you pretend that instead of being hesistant to send in peacekeepers after a year of farcical lies and warfare that the eu presidency pulls it 's balls out of it 's purse and takes a decisive step to end this conflict . 
  if russia is that worried about `` cheap goods flooding the russian market '' then they can simply sanction sectors of the ukranian market they 're concerned about , not that i imagine there 's going to be a normalized level of trade between the two states for a long time now . 
  and of course the end of the constant threat of war removes all hindrances ( or excuses ) for kiev from turning it 's full attention to it 's economic and corruption problems , particularly in the energy market . 
  and then everybody 's happy . 
   but when it 's assumed they are just a rag tag group of `` separatists '' which are not getting aid from state actors ( russia keeps telling everyone it does not supply weapons or training ) it 's been frustrating how we 've shown we 're apparently okay with this as long as the bully keeps saying he 's not doing anything . 
  it 's got to be even worse for a country like ukraine with less than full confidence in the capability and accountability of their military . 
  say what you want about the swedish military , i doubt there 's many of them who are worried about their superiors being on the take . 
  * `` all journalism is equally biased . 
  '' * - some jackass trying to make this into a story for the ignorant . 
  this ai n't the un . 
  yup , that 's what [ these puppies are for .
