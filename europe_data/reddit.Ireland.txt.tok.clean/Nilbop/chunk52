   a truce between the two sides in the conflict was brokered in february . 
   but two ukrainian soldiers told the bbc 's tom burridge that the fighting has continued despite the agreement signed by ukrainian forces and pro-russian rebels in minsk . 
   our correspondent says that after the most intense shelling had died down , ** they were shown a large unexploded shell that had apparently smashed through the upstairs wall of the building . 
  **  ** its size suggests it was fired from a heavy weapon , the type that should have been withdrawn from the frontline under the minsk agreement , ** our correspondent adds . 
  emphasis mine . 
  the article continues to give the views of some ukrainian soldiers the correspondant is embedded with , and then goes on to relay the accusation the white house made yesterday that the kremlin has yet to respond to :  the us state department on wednesday accused `` combined russian-separatist forces '' of violating the terms of minsk by keep artillery and multiple rocket launchers in prohibited areas . 
   spokeswoman marie harf also accused the russian military of deploying `` additional air defence systems into eastern ukraine '' and moving several of them `` nearer the front lines '' . 
   the `` increasingly complex nature '' of the training of separatists `` leaves no doubt that russia is involved '' , she added . 
   `` after maintaining a relatively steady presence along the border , russia is sending additional units there . 
  these forces will give russia its largest presence on the border since october 2014 . '', 
   the ukrainian government , western leaders and nato say there is clear evidence that russia is helping the rebels with heavy weapons and soldiers . 
  independent experts echo that accusation . 
  moscow denies it , insisting that any russians serving with the rebels are `` volunteers '' . 
   being born in russia and knowing the kind of politics run in eastern european countries such as ukraine , belarus and kazachstan ( not to speak of russia itself ) i have an honest not `` hollywood version '' of politics and you ca n't criticize my views for not having good faith . 
  that 's a very personal attack on my views and not constructive at all . 
  if anything it 's an attack on corruption of politics . 
   laws were passed on january 16 , 2014 by the parliament . 
  pretty much anti-freedom of speech and assembly laws but nevertheless , laws which passed . 
  edit : and on january 28 nine of those laws were repealed and limited versions were passed . 
  unconstitutional laws then . 
  source me . 
   you might have work experience and graduated but the view of the law is n't affected by practicality or technicality . 
  i 'm not defending the theory of yanukovych 's removal from office being a `` coup '' or wrong , i 'm saying it was not followed by the procedure presented by the constitution , therefore it was unconstitutional and that is n't up for debate . 
  even if i 'd agree with your pov on him `` fleeing '' ( i see it as many different factors coming in - but as you said there is no discussion there ) the office , nevertheless the rada has to follow the constitution and it states that after the impeachment of the president the next to assume head of state is the prime-minister in office . 
  you can interpret it however you like , there are simple facts that dictate how the law flows : the president abandoned his office . 
  the prime minister is the ** head of government . 
  ** the head of government ** can not be the head of state . 
  ** this is called the separation of powers . 
  i have literally no idea where you are getting these ideas from . 
  unless you have a concrete source for me then i 'm going to assume you are just confused , because that is * nowhere * in the ukrainian constitution . 
  i imagine i 'll be waiting a lot longer than that . 
  the east is reportedly the more industrialized half of ukraine ( albeit owned by kiev-based corporations ) , so i imagine that plays into it . 
  and then there 's whether or not you give credence to the idea of russia pushing through mariupol and westwards to create a land-bridge to ukraine . 
  both the sources calling out the ukrainian reporting and the scale of the claims leave me unconvinced it 's an equivalent narrative , or even close to one . 
  that would be more palatable to kiev but likewise i do n't see it being offered and i do n't see them giving up the donbas . 
   civil-rights movement , the universal suffrage movement , the arab spring  these all had extensive media support and support from the top . 
  i 'm done with you . 
  that 's happening in the long run anyway . 
  i do n't see any gain to ukraine giving up it 's territory to contras for the chance of * maybe * expediating that arrangement . 
  they do n't got jokes over in germany , huh . 
  for those not interested in clicking ( and bare in mind this is yahoo , so take what they say with a grain of salt ) :  moscow ( ap ) -- chechnya 's leader on wednesday told his security forces to open fire on russian federal troops if they operate in the region without his approval . 
   ramzan kadyrov 's comments late wednesday send a worrying sign about a potential rift between him and the federal security services . 
   ** following the killing of a man in the chechen capital this week by security forces from a neighboring region , kadyrov told his forces they can open fire on troops from other regions if they operate without his approval . 
  **  ** `` i would like to officially state : open fire if someone from moscow or stavropol , it does n't matter , appears on your turf without your knowledge , '' ** he said in an address to his forces . 
  `` we have to be reckoned with . '', 
   a wanted man was killed in grozny on sunday in a special operation of federal forces stationed in chechnya as well as law enforcement officials from stavropol , russian media reported . 
  emphasis mine . 
  the article goes on to give a bit more general background , helpful if , like me , you 've only a passing knowledge on what the situation in chechnya has become :  in exchange for the relative calm he has installed in chechnya after two separatist wars , kadyrov has been allowed to maintain his own security force . 
  moscow has largely ignored the rampant abuses , including torture and extrajudicial killings . 
   kadyrov 's private army came under the spotlight last month when a chechen police officer was arrested as one of the main suspects in the feb. 27 murder of russian opposition leader boris nemtsov . 
   kadyrov praised the suspect , zaur dadaev , as a brave soldier and a deeply religious man . 
  i suppose first of all you 'd have to answer what culturally european means . 
  what are `` european '' values ? 
  european shared histories ? 
  `` european '' legislation ? 
  `` european '' policies ? 
  huh ? 
  how is russia losing in that scenario ? 
  there is so much wrong with your point of view i 'm staggered to find a place to even start . 
  so the baltics , poland , they could all join the - you know what , no . 
  i 'm done talking with this crackpot . 
   it so naive that you think the ukranian people are the ones making things happen in ukraine . 
  i 'm just about finished with you then . 
   nothing this big happens , yet alone in ukraine with 40 million people without some powerful people having a say in things . 
  yeah so the civil-rights movement , the universal suffrage movement , the arab spring , that 's all just - oh , jesus why am i wasting my time with this ...  and lets get this straight . 
  i 'd very much prefer a pro western ukraine and russia . 
  i am very pro-eu . 
  yeah . 
  that 's why i get sent messages from you like this :  i do n't think i 'm going to get through your thick western viewpoint skull at all no matter what i say . 
  i do n't watch videos in the office . 
  russia does n't `` have '' ukraine you weirdo . 
  i do n't think anybody here is supporting the glorification of azov or other ultranationalist neo-nazis , but their participation in this conflict has been ** ridiculously ** overblown by the kremlin . 
  i 'd have to assume it 's a mix of both , but heavily weighted to the former . 
  i do n't think it 's easy to see whether or not a policeman has a personal camera on their person . 
   i do n't know where you are from but i question your belief towards a politician 's election promise . 
  my common sense forbids me to believe that yanukovych would 've actually followed trough with his pro-eu movement despite some dubious phone call from putin . 
  i stronly advise you to question everything critically in this matter , but it 's up to you . 
  oh for goodness sake this is such a hollywood version of politics . 
  you run on and vote for someone based upon their promises taken at face value . 
  * especially * a head of state . 
  everyone questions these notions critically * by default , * but at some point you need to make a good-faith decision . 
  good christ , this is why the maidan started in the first place . 
   well good for you , then you understand the legal aspects of your country and you have a feeling for the legal perspective . 
  as for ordering the police to open fire upon citizens after trying to legislate against the protest : the legislation actually came trough so the police had legal grounds to force the people to vacate the maidan . 
  even though i disagree with the brutality and lethal action you ca n't argue that it was illegal . 
  immoral ? 
  yes . 
  i might be wrong here , so i 'm going to ask you to source me that yanukovych 's anti-protest legislation went through . 
  aside from being draconian i assumed it was illegitimate due to it 's unconstitutionality . 
   well as a law grad you should know that the law is the law and there 's no such thing as `` technicalities '' , either do it right or wait until you have the full 75 % + . 
  it would 've hurt noone to actually follow the constitution , the one thing that defines your nations rules and orders . 
  when you graduate and get some work experience you 'll understand that practicality trumps technicality every time . 
  and regardless of your qualms about the impeachment , the law was followed : yanukovych fled office . 
  nothing needed be done by the rada at that point , but they went ahead anyway . 
   and the last thing you got kind of wrong is that per ukrainian constitution the one who should 've assumed office after the illegal removal ( even if you claim it was only formal ) of yanukovych would have been the acting prime minister serhiy arbuzov . 
  he should have been the one to bring up a motion of re-election to the rada if you argue with the constitution . 
  do n't insert weasel-words into the conversation : yanukovych 's removal was legitimate . 
  that discussion is done . 
  after that , the interim government acted within the letter of the law - they were electing a head of state , not a new prime-minister . 
  they followed that remit * to the letter .
