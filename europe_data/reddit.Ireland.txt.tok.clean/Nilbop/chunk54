  why were they called cyborgs and what is oun-upa ? 
  kaloo-kalay , what a day for me . 
  answer the question already . 
   i know it did . 
  i was responding to the fact that you brought putin/russia up when it was irrelevant to op 's point . 
  the fact that you think putin and russia are irrelevant when it comes to ukranian politicis is beyond staggering in it 's sheer , blatant stupidity . 
  the rest of your post is just meaningless boilerplate and you 're realizing it . 
  i 'm from the uk . 
  i 'd love for us to send our big , modern army in , that 's why i 'm calling for it . 
  where are * you * from ? 
   honestly , this is so irrational that i 'm not sure what to say in response . 
  you fucked up a source . 
   nato is fighting the taliban . 
  i provided a link to nato 's website that says this : you provided a link to a bbc website citing a taliban spokesperson saying they had `` defeated nato . '', 
  meanwhile , i 'm still waiting for an answer to this  sorry only small portions of what army are in ukraine ? 
  just so we 're clear . 
  just whisper the answer in my ear . 
  it 's okay , i wo n't tell anyone . 
  see the way it says nilbop next to me presenting my arguement ? 
  that means * i * said that bit . 
  in summation : * op is wrong , nato is not being used as an ethnically divisive tool , nor could it be as [ all of ukraine supports it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ukrainian_presidential_election_2014_map.png ) * putin has been using and inflaming ethnic tensions to mount his invasion since day one . 
  * [ poroshenko was elected on a mandate by the entirety of ukraine to pursue a pro-eu pro-nato policy which he publicly campaigned upon . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_presidential_election,_2014 ), 
  glad to see you admit that what we 're talking about has happened before and is precedent for both intervention in ukraine and ukraine accession into nato . 
  because otherwise you 're simply burying your head in the sand . 
  i 'm not downvoting you . 
   this means fuck all . 
  do n't blame me . 
  i 'm not the one who said ukrainians were cyborgs and murderous heroes . 
   why are you talking about russia again ? 
  the discussion was about poroshenko using said tactics . 
  nobody said russia was innocent of the same tactics . 
  nobody even implied that before you said it . 
  is this a joke ? 
  i 'm talking about poroshenko because he was wrongly accused of using nato application to stoke ethnic tensions , as absurd as sounds at face value because * nato provides protection regardless of ethnicity . 
  * i 'm talking about russia because russia is invading ukraine based upon * explicitly state ethnic lines . 
  *  not sure what relevance the majority of this has to anything that 's been said . 
  then you 're an idiot ? 
   nobody said nato would discriminate based on ethnic grounds . 
  nobody said russia would n't discriminate based on ethnic grounds . 
  * `` but this still is n't relevant '' * - / u/ipadalienblue , april 23rd 2015  the original point ( again , that i did n't make - it was that other guy ) , was that poroshenko asking for a referendum on nato is a tool used to divide ukrainians . 
  his asking for the referendum is the thing that will divide ukrainians , not nato itself as an organisation . 
  based upon * what ? 
  * almost the entirety of ukraine , including the russian-ethnic areas and the east , [ voted for him * based upon these policies . 
  * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ukrainian_presidential_election_2014_map.png ) read a report , jesus christ . 
   you knew about ( and name dropped ) article 5 , so you 're definitely in-the-know . 
  now you 're just wasting keystrokes . 
  nilbop : the op is wrong , putin is explicitly using ethnic tensions for his own gains . 
  nato is a defensive organization that provides protection to a state with no regard to ethnicity . 
  ipadalienblue : whatatboutism . 
   no , everywhere trolling means making comments like this one : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/33kpns/poroshenko_wants_referendum_on_nato/cqlx53c?context=3  you are a troll . 
  that does n't mean everything you say is wrong , but there is no doubt at all that you use troll tactics . 
  ah , so your repeated inability to answer this question :  sorry only small portions of what army are in ukraine ? 
  just so we 're clear . 
  does not mean that * you * are a troll who can not carry his own arguement , it means the guy calling you out on your bullshit is a troll . 
  you still need to answer that question . 
   i 'm so glad you said this so i can expose you for the clueless idiot you are : http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/69772.htm & http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30626728 . 
  if you have any intellectual honesty , you 'll bow out now for knowing absolutely nothing . 
  so i 'm now dealing with a person who uses the radical muslim terrorists squatting in caves as a source for saying they are fighting nato now , because of the fact that nato have never said they are at war with the taliban ? 
  because nato are n't at war with the taliban ? 
  like , did you not think about that link at all before you posted it ? 
   ireland is n't even in nato : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_neutrality you are actually so embarrassing . 
  i wish i had n't spent this time talking to someone so clueless . 
  indeed they are not . 
  i 'm from northern ireland though . 
  how 's it going ? 
   nevermind how cringeworthy it is for some nobody on the internet to be saying that he has some kind of authority over what his country can do . 
  er , you are aware that all of us can voice our opinions at any time , right ? 
  i mean , not in russia , obviously , and apparently not in whatever part of australia you 're from either . 
   that 's funny , because actually , i 'm the one who does n't want my country to get involved in a war , and you 're the one who does , and somehow i 'm the jingoistic one . 
  oh come on you 'd be a perfect fit for the mental gymnastic they go through to validate their position . 
  you could talk to them about how you use the taliban as sources . 
  [ so bosnia and herzegovina then , tell me about that intervention . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_intervention_in_bosnia_and_herzegovina ) [ with reference to bosnia 's induction into nato , too . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enlargement_of_nato ) i mean that to me looks like precedent . 
  i dunno , i 'm just a guy who knows what he 's talking about , though . 
  i 'm always interested in hearing what the other guy thinks . 
  cyborgs . 
  and non-murderous heroes . 
   well first of all you are kind of wrong about the timeline of pro-russia/pro-eu movements in ukraine . 
  the re-election campaign itself was based on the promise to the people to go with the eu rather than russia but then after winning the election they went backwards which infuriated the people ( -  maidan reactions ) . 
  that 's what i said , i just included the incident of the overnight call with putin that caused yanukovych to renege on all of his election promises . 
   also it is safe to assume you 're on the far-western pov of the events since you refer to the current government as `` democratically elected '' which by itself is not wrong , except for the fact that abolishing the acting president was unconstitutional in the first place . 
  so basically you mean the current government which was established by a ( not-so peaceful ) revolution . 
  er , no , i 'm from the dealing-with-facts pov . 
  i guess you 're implying you 're from the other pov ? 
  anyway , regarding your point . 
  that 's incorrect . 
  yanukovych abandoned his office . 
  end of discussion . 
  if you want to keep discussing after that ( and i agree ) then the rada officially removed him . 
  then the interim government held open elections [ in which almost every voting district including the entirety of the east barring the donbas voted for poroshenko . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ukrainian_presidential_election_2014_map.png ) every province . 
  not just the tens of thousands in the maidan which showed that all of ukraine was united against yanukovych - almost every province voting showed that support to have been legitimate . 
   and to the last point : refering to ukraine as russia 's backyard was certainly wrong but the perception of the matter is what really counts . 
  since the collapse of the soviet union the nato expanded exponentially towards the east and that led to a strong anti-western movement in russia aswell as ukraine , belarus and kazachstan which are still tied up in many political , economic and still cultural matters . 
  that is why refering to it as backyard is wrong , but the metaphor stands for the perception of the people which gets it done . 
  a couple of years ago you would have said the same for the baltics and poland and maybe even romania and hungary . 
  it does n't mean much . 
  russia ca n't counter the simple fact that it 's own jingoistic policies and economic mismanagement are driving former client states to the more open and prosperous economies and government and legal mechanisms of the eu .
