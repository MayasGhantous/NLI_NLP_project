   europe has no armies . 
  is idiotic hyperbole and dilutes whatever you are trying to say . 
  the moderator of / r/russia bans people because they told him that russia invaded georgia and that stalin was last century 's greatest killer . 
  i do n't want our subreddit to follow his kind of policies . 
  okay , remind us . 
  you make it sound like it was calling for the blood of every iraqi child , so let 's see it . 
  you 're out of your goddamn mind . 
  [ georgia did not in fact initiate the conflict . 
  the russian-backed separatists did . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-georgian_war ) where does this sound familiar ? 
   as the soviet union weakened in early 1991 , the soviet georgia declared its independence . 
  amidst this backdrop , a 1991 -- 1992 war between georgia and separatists in the south ossetia region left parts of that region under de facto russian-backed and internationally unrecognised separatist control . 
  [ 31 ] after the war was halted , a joint peacekeeping force of georgian , russian and ossetian troops was stationed in the region . 
  [ 32 ] meanwhile , a similar situation developed during 1992 -- 1993 in the georgian region of abkhazia . 
  [ 33 ] after a prolonged lull , relations between georgia and russia began to worsen in april 2008 . 
  [ 34 ] [ 35 ] ** ossetian separatists began shelling georgian villages on 1 august , ** with a sporadic response from georgian peacekeepers in the region . 
  [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] georgia launched a large-scale military operation during the night of 7 -- 8 august , [ 39 ] recapturing most of tskhinvali in hours . 
  [ 40 ] the georgian government said it was responding to attacks on its villages in south ossetia , [ 41 ] and that russia was moving non-peacekeeping units into the country . 
  `` reasonable '' is not saying this  yes yes i know we are perfect and they are liars murderers who like tyranny and eat children . 
  reasonable is being open to both sides of an arguement while using good judgement to decide between the two . 
  wonderful , thanks !, 
  i do n't really care if you think a head of state is trolling another country or not . 
  to be fair , * there was a foreign military sub in their capital city . 
   currently the majority of hubs in europe ( except the british and dutch ) do n't really serve as true reference points and there is a lot of work to be done . 
  what 's the problem with the non-british/dutch european hubs , out of curiosity ? 
  it 's good to see the community rally around the poor girl , but for fuck 's sake , some cunts just ca n't stop being cunts . 
  [ tell your handler to spend his lunch break reading this . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_war_crimes ), 
  this language scares the everloving shit out of me . 
  details . 
  that 's the one i 'm from , big lawd . 
  game of thrones is filmed in ireland though : x, 
  you ... you ca n't just put * thunder * in the title !, 
  it looks stupid !, 
  wow that 's uh , really embarassing . 
  sorry welsh posters . 
  he 's just filling this thread up with his opinions that fly in the face of every available fact brought to him . 
  do n't bother with him . 
  all that aside , europe is in a very strong position militarily even with a reliance on both french and british militaries ( not that other major players like germany , italy or spain can be ignored either ) . 
  while i do wish more of us would meet and surpass our 2 % gdp committment to military spending , with legislation like the [ eu mutual defence clause in the lisbon treaty ] ( http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/glossary/mutual_defence_en.htm ) and [ nato 's article 5 ] ( http://www.nato.int/terrorism/five.htm ) i think we 're in a pretty good place . 
  the fact that you do n't know what a mutual defence clause is is your own shortcoming . 
  you should probably actually read the legislation governing the eu before you talk about it next time . 
  that being said since you went on to make fun of my country like a petulant child i do n't really care what your opinions are beyond this point . 
  cheers but i 'm pretty sure he 's just trolling . 
  you do n't lose arguements graciously , do you ? 
  i do n't care about your personal interpretation , the reality is right down there on the page . 
  i think we 're all in agreement that that would have made intervention much less likely . 
  wrong on both counts . 
  the eu has both independant military bodies ( small as the battle groups are ) [ and a mutual defence clause under the lisbon treaty ] ( http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/glossary/mutual_defence_en.htm ) which covers national military forces . 
  furthermore , [ article 5 triggers if a nato member is attacked regardless of whether that body is giving aid or not . 
  ] ( http://www.nato.int/terrorism/five.htm ) it does not discriminate that this has to be on the nation 's sovereign territory ; a member-state 's standing army abroad coming under attack triggers article 5 . 
  that is what people are only going to realize the next time a big conflict arises and people start pointing back here as precedent . 
  [ they were never close to achieving them , by all accounts . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libya_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction ) that being said , apparently ukrainian missiles were only launchable from moscow anyway . 
  though that 's a very confusing scenario to credit . 
  i think a lot of that is justly and fairly brought about by peace , enrichment , technology and in particular the internet making us closer together than ever before . 
  i can talk to someone in moscow or beijing or berlin anytime i want now . 
  that 's literally never happened before on a scale accessible * to the average person . 
  * it 's throwbacks like putin and underdeveloped , poorer and thus militaristic nations like north korea that make us fear otherwise . 
  nervous . 
  especially in a world where russia and china do . 
  that 's my lowest level fear . 
  to be honest , with putin in the kremlin i think it 's a very reasonable one . 
  he 's damaged the image of russia irrevocably . 
  i feel like none of you know what you 're talking about . 
  if the eu intervenes and russia attacks , even in response , an eu state that is also a member-state of nato , [ then article 5 is triggered . 
  ] ( http://www.nato.int/terrorism/five.htm ), 
  the putin administration is not known for it 's critical thinking . 
  nobody cares about your fucking blog . 
  this what you sound like when you armchair general , everybody . 
  [ country x ] holds out one day , [ country y ] holds out two days because it 's on mountainous terrain . 
  allright , i 'm just gon na say it ; ... 
  * cyborgs ? 
  do n't be melodramatic . 
  moscow knows war with nato ends only in their comets loss . 
  there 's a reason we have the term * `` sabre-rattling . 
  i 'm not saying that 's not an option . 
  i 'm also not condemning it , given what the people if ukraine are enduring , or how it frames anew in their mind what their parents endured under the ussr . 
  history is continually being educated by its consequences . 
  it 's much easier to pass comment on a random scandal than pledge support for something positive . 
  that said , the art scene in this city is relatively well funded as it is , but it 's not like more wo n't help . 
  that hardly changes the insult or oppressive nature of posting a monument to a genocidal maniac on our land . 
  if you can find support for statues to cromwell in ireland or stalin in ukraine , then feel free to educate me . 
  not to take anything from the suffering of greek descendants in canada , but churchill allowing a bloody civil war to take its course is not even close to an adequate comparison for years-long , sustained campaigns of genocide and oppression . 
  do n't engage him . 
  he 's not even reading your posts . 
  yeah she 's uh , she 's not taking this with grace . 
  chiming in from toronto - there is not a lot of buzz over this . 
  that might have something to do with toronto being one of the biggest ukrainian cities outside europe . 
  how you choose to act and believe and vote and politic is down to you . 
  i 'm not claiming that when i destroy the monument to a man who led a genocidal war against my people and then set the stage for hundreds of years of cultural , ethnic , political and legal oppression and persecution ( and i use both of those words with surety ) that i am operating within the parameters of the law . 
  but while i have my own land , my own senses and the ability to swing a hammer , there wo n't be a statue to the fundamentalist murderer of my people present on it . 
  if you 're equating cromwell with churchill you need to educate your history . 
  it 's rather telling that you have absolute zero point of reference for where these people are coming from . 
  here 's the thing ; if there were a statue of oliver cromwell in my town ( you can google the fucker if you do n't know who he is , i 'm on my phone and linking is a ball ache ) i would personally dismantle that fucker with a hammer . 
  art is no validation of character . 
  please remember that the very mention of anglophobia or amerophobia is a sign of * severe * russophobia . 
  the amount of joy i 'd get from seeing farage skewered by an angry old polish dude is hard to describe . 
  yeah i get a lot of free time now that my unit at the cia has been stood down from stalking pro-putin anti-russian apologists on reddit . 
  i 'm just here on my own getting buzzed on jim bean and rocking out to yyz .
