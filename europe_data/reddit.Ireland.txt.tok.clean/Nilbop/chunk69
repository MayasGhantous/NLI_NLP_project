  so , putting your bigotry aside , you support russia in their suppression of chechen separatists so logically you must support ukraine in their suppression of russian-funded separatists . 
  that 's so cool of you to point out . 
  you are clearly proficient in the arts of discourse . 
  returning to the topic : you 've provided little in the way of intelligent discourse and have refused to address the gaping holes in your position . 
  i 'm left agape and staggered by the flaws in your posts and am left to reveal the absurdity of your self-assured attitude . 
   the line where gorbachov says there was no agreement is not news . 
  not even russia has claimed that there was a legally binding agreement like there was for eastern germany . 
  this line has been enthusiasticly pulled out of its context to disprove russia 's claim that nato made a sort of promise or assurance not to expand to the east . 
  but , rather ironically , gorbachov affirms this claim in the same interview . 
  here you are literally within the same paragraph attempting to point out the absurdity of the idea that there was an agreement , while then trying to say that gorbachov then affirms it . 
  you 're flip-flopping and making no sense . 
   so , if we are going to take gorbachov 's word for it , which you did before so i do not see any reason why we should n't , we may conclude that there was no legally binding agreement . 
  but nato did promise or at least did everything it could to give russia the impression that nato expansion was out of the question . 
  which explains the russian reaction to it . 
  and now we 've gone on to say that he * did * say there was an agreement when there was n't . 
  no promise , no agreement , no paper , no aural understanding , nothing . 
  once again :  the various players involved have different versions of events . 
  of course there was a promise not to expand nato `` as much as a thumb 's width further to the east , '' mikhail gorbachev , the soviet president at the time , says in moscow today . 
  however , gorbachev 's former foreign minister , eduard shevardnadze , speaking in the georgian capital tbilisi , says that there were no such assurances from the west . 
  not that there was no binding agreement ; there were no assurances of any kind . 
   the topic of `` nato expansion '' was not discussed at all , and it was n't brought up in those years . 
  i say this with full responsibility . 
  not a single eastern european country raised the issue , not even after the warsaw pact ceased to exist in 1991 . 
  western leaders did n't bring it up , either . 
  source 1 and 2 there was no mention of eastward expansion at all . 
  nothing . 
  nothing . 
  end of discussion . 
   geoffrey roberts i 'm gon na jump in here . 
  first line of the criticism section on the article on [ geoffrey roberts  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geoffrey_roberts )  ** roberts has come under criticism from andrew bacevich , who claims in a review in the national interest that roberts is overly sympathetic towards stalin , taking the word of the soviet leadership uncritically in his writings , thus presenting a biased view and significantly undermining the usefulness of his scholarship . 
  ** [ 3 ] according to jonathan haslam , roberts relies too heavily on edited soviet archival documents and goes too far in his conclusions , therefore making his accounts somewhat one sided and by no means telling a full story . 
  so putting aside the fact that you `` hate islamists '' , should you not then be supporting russia seeing as chechnya is a largely islamic region ? 
  and you hate them , apparently . 
  that same article then quotes him saying there was no such agreement . 
  your belief has no base , and yet you accuse others of cherry-picking their history . 
  that 's the belief that  i starting to get, 
  did you ? 
  you are basing your entire belief on one article that contradicts itself . 
   so gorbachov pretty much agrees with der spiegel . 
  der spiegel is a german publication that was , in this instance , quoting gorbachov . 
  it is not agreeing with him , it is reporting his thoughts . 
  within the same article , and in several * different * articles ( which you , being a hypocrite , are ignoring while telling other people they are ignoring evidence ) he admits there was never such any agreement . 
  are you aware of * any * of this ? 
  well i mean heck let 's use [ wiki 's  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fascism )  fascism ( / f\u00e6\u0283\u026az\u0259m / ) is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism [ 1 ] [ 2 ] that came to prominence in early 20th-century europe . 
  influenced by national syndicalism , fascism originated in italy during world war i , combining more typically right-wing positions with elements of left-wing politics , [ 3 ] in opposition to liberalism , marxism , and traditional conservatism . 
  although fascism is often placed on the far-right within the traditional left -- right spectrum , several academics have said that the description is inadequate . 
  your `` evidence '' does not provide evidence to the contrary , so i will ask you to provide some now . 
  as / u/highdagger already pointed out to you , this is what your article says :  the various players involved have different versions of events . 
  of course there was a promise not to expand nato `` as much as a thumb 's width further to the east , '' mikhail gorbachev , the soviet president at the time , says in moscow today . 
  however , gorbachev 's former foreign minister , eduard shevardnadze , speaking in the georgian capital tbilisi , says that there were no such assurances from the west . 
  which is based on gorbachev 's opinion . 
  gorbachev then explicitly went on to state this :  the topic of `` nato expansion '' was not discussed at all , and it was n't brought up in those years . 
  i say this with full responsibility . 
  not a single eastern european country raised the issue , not even after the warsaw pact ceased to exist in 1991 . 
  western leaders did n't bring it up , either . 
  source [ 1 ] ( http://rbth.co.uk/international/2014/10/16/mikhail_gorbachev_i_am_against_all_walls_40673.html ) and [ 2 ] ( http://www.interpretermag.com/russia-this-week-hundreds-of-russians-poisoned-25-dead-in-spice-drug-epidemic/#4654 ) again , this has already been pointed out to you , and in your sheer hypocrisy you decide simply not to acknowledge evidence that paints you as wrong . 
  so again , before any of us waste anymore time with you , provide your evidence . 
  excuse me ? 
  you accused my statement of being false here :  the article is very clear in underlining that there are different versions of the story . 
  just handpicking the lines you prefer is complete nonsense . 
  the only truth here is that at the moment we can not say for sure whether there was a deal or not . 
  therefore nilbop 's statement should be considered false . 
  when it is abundantly clear both then and during the intervening quarter-century that there was no deal . 
  you offer no substantiation for this other than an assumption of a false positive , and proceed to moan when people call you out on it . 
  you then decide to act like a petulant child and demand that people prove * a false-false positive to you * before you will deign to concede that you are in the wrong ? 
  you must be used to getting your way at home , because you have some incredible amount of arrogance around you . 
  if you want to call me a liar then you 'd damn well do so with some actual evidence that i 'm wrong , otherwise nobody is going to waste anymore time on little miss / u/trop _ commercial . 
  the province still exists , it 's just split between 2 countries . 
  map i made after playing crusader kings 2 for a bit , right down to the incorrect coats for the irish provinces they used . 
  literally nobody is seriously accusing putin of being a communist . 
  the charge , each and every time , is he is a jingoist and ultranationalist who wants to restore the russian empire . 
  come with us now , on a journey through time and space , to the world of * the mighty boosh !, 
  that 's why the actual headline says * suspected * russian sub , and then goes on to explain the situation . 
  it 's almost like you should read the article before jumping to post a response or something . 
  er , the putin administration is the definition of a fascist regime . 
  it passed the point of mere resemblance a long , long time ago . 
  this has just made me realize that i 've lived in canada for a few years now and have literally never seen one of these for them . 
  defending the championship is a hell of a thing , even if a huge part of it was down to those plucky french . 
  no , putin 's ambitions and successes with states desperate for appeasement are doing that . 
  you 'd give up everything anytime anyone ever threatened you then , would you ? 
  yes , it 's a humanitarian intervention without un mandate . 
  it also protected the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and directly resulted in the establishment of the ongoing united nations mission in kosovo . 
  i 'd love if nato had intervened in * more * humanitarian disasters . 
  imagine the lives that could have been saved in rwanda or darfur without the constant vetoing of * certain parties * on the unsc . 
  explain to me how that is an expansion eastward . 
  i will literally wait ** days ** for your response . 
  a refusal to accept your own failings often comes at the cost of alienating others . 
  for the umpteenth billionth , trillionth , fucking * gazillionth * time , there was * no agreement by nato not to expand east and * no obligation on nato 's part to reject applications because lest you forget * nato does not * extend * membership opportunities , it * accepts applications * it always brings a smile to my face that contrarians or apologists like to reference a common-knowledge piece of historical trivia like it was some pearl they 'd unearthed from the sea-floor and use that to validate an absurd opinion . 
  the cuban missile crisis ?!, 
  what 's * that ?? 
  * here 's the rub : if we 're giving extra consideration to russia we are * by necessity * taking that goodwill * away * from ukraine . 
  and not just ukraine in this instance , but every state that russia sets itself against , which given moscow 's current jingoistic regime is virtually all of it 's western neighbours including members of the eu and nato , from sweden to finland to estonia to latvia to lithuania to poland to moldova to romania . 
  and to reiterate - an * enormous * amount of consideration has and * continues to be * given to russia . 
  it 's punishment for invading a peaceful european neighbour has so far amounted to minor sanctions on trade and select politicians and diplomatic ill-will . 
  that 's a * long length * short of what could be done in a non-interventionist sense ( sanctioning the energy market and withdrawal of access to swift is often lauded around ) before anyone even talks about arming ukraine to help repell this invasion maskerading as a civil war . 
  do they at least mean `` big dog '' , `` little dog '' , `` spotty dog '' , stuff like that ? 
  they ca n't all just mean * dog . 
  this ca n't be real . 
  sorry , but it * is * ryanair . 
  it 's the mr burns of airlines .
