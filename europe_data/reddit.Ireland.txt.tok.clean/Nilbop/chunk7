  it did n't . 
   i do not support neither western nor russian actions from a moral or legal standpoint , but russia had a reason and a justification to act the way it acted . 
  no , it did n't . 
  you can not invade a peaceful neighbour `` because nato . '', 
   threatening with sanctions is also economic coercion . 
  [ you do n't want to engage in a debate about economic cooercion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gazprom#price_disputes ) . 
   sanctioning the president who turned his back to the eu does n't benefit eu ? 
  the stated goal was the protection of the citizenry . 
  you can argue all you like , those are the facts . 
   the west breached the agreement first , in what way ? 
  because we both know russia was engaging in economic politicking with ukraine since the dissolution of the ussr . 
   not to mention the agreement on nato 's eastward non-expansion . 
  it never existed . 
   utter lie . 
  crimean authorities invited osce to monitor the referendum , but the osce declined , calling the referendum illegal . 
  again , russians invited osce , osce declined . 
  true , because guess what ? 
  it * was * illegal . 
  [ but then some osce members did try to attend , and russia turned them away . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_referendum,_2014#non-osce_observers ) [ if over 100 nations and independant bodies condemn your invasion as illegal , your invasion is probably illegal . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_general_assembly_resolution_68/39 )  fyi , i did n't `` hold the referendum '' . 
  i 'm not even russian . 
  i 'm not using `` you '' in the personal sense . 
   the agreement was void the moment the west broke it . 
  again , lies , lies and more lies . 
  substantiate that the west somehow broke this referendum before russia while russia has been giving ukraine special prices on trade and energy since it 's inception . 
  go on . 
  ... are you serious like , do you even know what finlandization [ is ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finlandization ) ? 
  i feel this is a bizarre move considernig we just appeased putin by pushing back the implementation of the recent deail with ukraine for over a year . 
  either we 're making a stand or we are n't . 
  yes the sanctions should still be in place , and in my opinion escalated , but this policy should be uniform on all fronts . 
  we ca n't be punishing them on one end then accomodating them on another , it sends a message of weakness . 
  and there are consequences to those consequences . 
  do you see how easy to continue this silly game is ? 
  the fact is if you drive countries into nato and then attempt to `` punish '' them for their actions then you in turn will be met with reprisal . 
  it 's a pointless circle . 
  i will remember to alert the taoiseach . 
  you 've probably never heard of this in america , but that 's a political tactic called a lie . 
   http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26258998  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10652114/eu-agrees-sanctions-against-ukraine.html these both state that they 're being considered against yanukovych :  but the eu said it expected measures to target those behind the `` repression '' . 
   european commission president jose manuel barroso spoke of the responsibility of `` the political leadership '' while several eu countries said they had no doubts that the ukrainian authorities were to blame . 
  so thanks for providing proof that everyone agreed the russian-bought president was behind the violence . 
  the united states of america , the russian federation , and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , reaffirm their commitment to ukraine , in accordance with the principles of the csce final act , to refrain from economic coercion designed ** to subordinate to their own interest the exercise by ukraine of the rights inherent in its sovereignty and thus to secure advantages of any kind . 
  ** do you understand the key points here ? 
  the eu sanctions proposed no benefit to the eu itself ; they were strictly tabled with the intent of protecting the citizenry of ukraine from the oppression of it 's governemnt . 
  there was absolutely no gain to the eu here , unless you consider allowing the protest to continue in their favour . 
  the sanctions * were never implemented . 
  * so in no way did the eu breach the memorandum . 
  contrary to this , observe the following :  1 . the united states of america , the russian federation , and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , reaffirm their commitment to ukraine , in accordance with the principles of the csce final act , to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of ukraine . 
  russia obviously breached this when it invaded ukraine and annexed crimea . 
  i wo n't hear anything about your phoney week-long referendum that you held under armed guard and turned away osce observers from ; if it was a legitimate referendum it could have waited until the situation calmed down . 
   2 . the united states of america , the russian federation , and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of ukraine , and that none of their weapons will ever be used against ukraine except in self-defense or otherwise in accordance with the charter of the united nations . 
  again , broken when russian arms and armour invaded ukraine , and likely breached again with the ongoing support of the russian-backed insurgents in the donbas who are constantly found with russian arms . 
   4 . the united states of america , the russian federation , and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland , reaffirm their commitment to seek immediate united nations security council action to provide assistance to ukraine , as a non-nuclear-weapon state party to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , if ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used . 
  which russia has failed to uphold by maintaining it 's occupation of ukraine in crimea and failing to act in the nations interests . 
  exactly . 
  this does n't make ireland 's policy `` illegal . '', 
   if ukrainians on their own ousted yanukovich , i 'd say nothing . 
  who else helped them ? 
  the fucking avengers ? 
   but the ousting was backed by the west and kiev was threatened economic sanctions by the west -- thus the west broke budapest agreement . 
  john mccain was the only politician who appeared and voiced his support . 
  kiev was not threatened with sanctions by the west . 
  that 's a complete lie you made up . 
  the budapest ** memorandum ** , not agreement , referred explicitly to safeguarding the integrity of ukraine 's borders , which russia broke when it invaded crimea . 
  it does not at any point mention economic sanctions , nevermind the fact that these sanctions were made up by you . 
  the difference is the lack of threat and the history of positive dealing and trade . 
  you never hear people in toronto complain about canadianization . 
  that is * literally * what russia is now . 
  yes that 's much worse than living under the militaristic hegemony of a nation that ca n't diversify it 's own economy and is busy alienating both diplomatic trade partners and it 's own educated professionals . 
  but there is n't a conflict right now . 
  i 'm sorry , i 'll repeat that ; * why the fuck should they ? 
   he was russia 's paid man , who was democratically elected . 
  and fled his office at the sight of protest after he ordered snipers to fire on his own people . 
   the protesters did n't request a permit for the protests , which means the protests were illegal . 
  okay a ) i 've never heard it said that you need a permit to protest in ukraine and b ) it 's irrelevant anyway . 
  it 's a * protest against the government . 
  * it does n't care if the government views it as legal . 
  russia 's paid man passed several law ** during the protests ** to oppress them , making it illegal . 
  * that 's * what you are arguing ; the side of a dicatator abusing his powers to oppress his people . 
   the police has the right , and duty , to uphold the law , which in this case means dispersing the protests . 
  and now you are supporting murderers shooting their own citizens . 
  russia is n't the west 's biggest geopolitical adversary . 
  you are n't a threat to them . 
  mccain is the only person who was there , and he was there to say he supported their protests and will to join the eu . 
  that 's directly in your quote . 
  you still do n't get to invade because a foreign politician is opposing the man you paid to lie and kill his own people . 
   read the article . 
  words , promises and assurances do n't mean anything unless you 're contractually obliged to uphold them , right ? 
  no , they do n't . 
  [ is n't that right ? 
  there were no assurances . 
  these countries are asking to join nato . 
  nato is not coming to them . 
  they are coming to nato because russia is a threat with a poor economy that can not afford to offer carrots instead of sticks . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  that 's seriously a valid concern . 
  a different war crime , but absolutely a concern . 
  assumedly moscow will be right on this asap . 
  it 'd be a short one , the us has utter air superiority . 
  the air forces of the other nato nations are a nice bonus .
