  ** [ 30 ] after the war was halted , a joint peacekeeping force of georgian , russian and ossetian troops was stationed in the region . 
  [ 31 ] meanwhile , a similar situation developed during 1992 -- 1993 in the georgian region of abkhazia . 
  [ 32 ] after a prolonged lull , relations between georgia and russia began to worsen in april 2008 . 
  [ 33 ] [ 34 ] ** ossetian separatists began shelling georgian villages on 1 august , ** with a sporadic response from georgian peacekeepers in the region . 
  [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] georgia launched a large-scale military operation during the night of 7 -- 8 august , [ 38 ] recapturing most of tskhinvali in hours . 
  [ 39 ] the georgian government said it was responding to attacks on its villages in south ossetia , [ 40 ] and that russia was moving non-peacekeeping units into the country . 
  [ 41 ] a lot of people here do n't seem to know their history . 
  does this scenario remind anyone of anything else ? 
  to the surprise of nobody . 
  so she has n't left russia , then ? 
  while i 'm sure that plays a part in the decision to offer ( or learn ) russian language classes , i 'm sure most of it has to do with the fact that it 's a very alien language for a british/irish person to learn and there are other major languages closer to home that are both more accessible and which britain/ireland has more dealing with . 
  literally no schoolkid has ever decided against learning russian because of the political climate . 
  fair enough . 
  different strokes , and all that . 
  nothing , why ? 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
   * brussels ( reuters ) - once depicted as a `` blue banana '' stretching from manchester to milan , europe 's industrial heartland has moved eastwards just as its political center of gravity has shifted to germany . 
  *  * a quarter of a century later , the continent 's industrial geography has morphed . 
  a more fitting image might be a golden soccer ball centered on southern germany and reaching into poland , hungary , the czech republic , slovakia , austria and romania . 
  * considering the horrible images the term * blue banana * conjures in the back of my mind , shit , i ai n't complainin ' . 
  more seriously , good !, 
  this kind of evolution is * exactly * why we enlarged the union and invested in central and eastern europe . 
  yeah , i audibly sighed when my eyes peeked over at the source . 
  i 'm not suggesting otherwise , and i 'd certainly like to see them join us , but only when it makes sense and as it currently stands fishing is probably too critical an industry for their survival to cede governance to brussels . 
  well it 's been like , a day since these reports started surfacing and people began entertaining them . 
  as enjoyable as this entire narrative is to read for a guy who hopes that putin will , indeed , be removed from power and replaced with a moderate , concilliatory or at least more pro-eu politician , reports like this :  * magen believes those responsible for the potential coup are `` branches or factions in the army who are working together or against one another , or wealthy businessmen , many of whom worked in these organizations . 
  they could only be people who are free to walk around the corridors of the kremlin . '' * is just the most ludicrously broad strokes you could possible paint . 
  the only thing of particular interest is in the following paragraph where he gives credence to the conspiracy theory many of us have been percalating for months now about dissatisfied oligarchs protecting their private interests , as opposed to politicians or generals outraged over policy choices . 
  i 'm sure we 'll all miss this narrative when it 's gone , though . 
  i 'd imagine outrage over one indicates support for another , but i 'm not going to act like i know more than the barest of bare facts about this . 
  as a federalist this kind of talk is always enjoyable to listen to , even if it 's still just talk :  * `` europe must accept that the world regards the e.u. 
  as more than just an economic union , '' raimund kirch , editor in chief of the n\u00fcrnberger zeitung , wrote in an editorial . 
  `` therefore , it must develop an independent moral and military power , in order to survive between the bi-polar forces . 
  '' *  * european commission president jean-claude juncker told germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper last week that a joint e.u. 
  army would `` convey to russia that we are serious about defending the values of the european union . 
  '' *  * `` this is not about having more influence in nato , '' former german nato general harald kujat told nbc news . 
  `` but the idea is that europe wants to show ` we must be more powerful ' in light of the ukraine crisis . 
  nato 's reaction time is too long because the europeans have reduced the readiness status of their forces so much that they are , in practice , not available within the necessary time frame . 
  '' * it also links to a pretty interesting . pdf document composed by a brussels-based thinktank on a more united military , including , among other things , the creation of a permanent eu military headquarters situated , as you 'd expect , in brussels . 
  it 's always nice to see support for accession to the eu , but staying out for now was probably the correct move for iceland considering it 's fishing industry . 
   interestingly enough , if their budgetary sovereignty was limited enough for the commission to have the final say , there would n't be any problems to begin with . 
  the member-states as a whole would have to be in a much more uniformly prosperous and stable economic situation to agree to this though . 
  and i do n't just mean going on from now , i mean in any hypothetical bubble-situation . 
  i did like that one , but the one after that with the prince of whatever was just so damned tedious when it should have been hilarious , and there 's been a lot of that happening this season . 
  we 've got a saying here regarding lunches , and it 's `` are you gon na finish that ? '', 
  i actually liked most of vice but it abandoned a lot of stuff i wanted resolved in the show and the running jokes got old ** reaaaaally ** quick . 
  you 've kind of already drawn yourself into the arguement pretty decisively if you 're talking about respecting ukrainian territorial integrity . 
  oh , fair enough . 
  did n't know that . 
  kinda feels like it 's spinning it 's wheels a bit and the barry episode was the worst one . 
  people forget that the us had a president serve 3-terms while suffering from fucking * polio . 
  so what 's the hip place to be ? 
  kreiss 3 right ? 
  all those english-speakers down on the waterfront , right ? 
  ... er , yeah ? 
  bare in mind the irish president is a mostly ceremonial role . 
  enda 's the one who holds all the power . 
  it 's literally the reverse of the russian situation . 
  man what is going on with archer this season, 
  what would have been the point ? 
  do n't make us send out the kite . 
   a plane that can do everything and take off vertically . 
  that * does * sound cool , though . 
  control + f my name in this thread and you 'll see it more than once . 
  seems to be more of a mediterranean-or-continental thing . 
   ( the dutch do n't eat , they feed themselves ) wow , that 's some advanced snobbery right there . 
  this all sounds great to me . 
  oh christ . 
  okay , someone tell me how close i am with this . 
  poffer-tuh-jays . 
  saucen-broot-jays . 
  that 's close , right ? 
  do we really need to have a worst ? 
  seems a bit arbitrary and mean . 
  as long as this allows you to sustain the awesome economic growth you 've been experiencing then that 's a sound investment . 
  let the economy enjoy itself for a few more years before you go spending all those glubeks on brand new military hardware tbh . 
  i 'm too emotionally drained to think about this anymore :(, 
  let 's hope the trend of increased european military cooperation ( and let 's be realistic , spending ) catches on . 
  no you 've pretty much got it spot on there . 
  oh yeah , absolutely . 
  as it stands right now ( and as it is likely to remain for quite some time ) we are an economic black hole . 
  most nationalists up here in the north would prefer a united ireland but are happy to settle with the greater peace and representation we 've won over the years . 
  the referendum 's still very much on the table , however . 
  er , we 're one referendum away from unification . 
  both london and dublin have signed off on it years ago . 
  it 's probably not going to happen anytime soon , because we 're pretty peaceful now and us nationalists have gotten a lot more representation and equity out of the government , which was one of our long-term goals , but if and when the nationalist population begins to outnumber the unionist one ( historically the trend , though in recent years the birth rates have been stabilizing ) then we can pop the big question . 
  crown carrot , marry angua , check in on susan , have vimes not retire even if he 's a hundred but make sure young sam grows up right , have moist and adora be happily married and running the city , have tiffany take over granny 's coven and have something chase rincewind somewhere . 
  even unseen academicals was a bit patchy , but yes by raising steam there were spelling and grammatical errors that should never have gotten past an editor , nevermind the man himself . 
  `` what can the harvest hope for , if not the care of the reaper man ? '', 
  what , are you gon na beat me up ? 
  if you think anyone is going to have anything remotely close to the swing that putin had after his death i 've got a lambda with a 3 next to it to sell you . 
  just go whole-hog and shovel ukrainian soil down his throat until his gut bursts open . 
  being honest if cameron or merkel dissappeared for a few days without explanation people * would * raise a few eyebrows . 
  i 've only ever heard of srpska through users here having it on their flair . 
  is the movement that serious ? 
  it looks like it would take most of bosnia & herzegovina with it . 
  and ... southern tyrol too ? 
  i know people are tired of hiring about this because russia is in the news so much recently , but the problem is still very much there and , looking at the creation of sputnik on top of rt and life and the utter lack of credibility for any of these outlets , it 's only getting worse . 
  they 're in a bind . 
  people can identify as one culture and happily live in another .
