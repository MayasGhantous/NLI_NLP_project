yes , that 's all i 'm saying . 
  of course it would be idiotic to hold a grudge against any british person/country or any person/country who just happened to be born in the same country as people who did awful things hundreds of years ago , and that 's something a lot of people forget . 
  countries do n't even really exist , they 're just bits of land most of us agree about who owns for now . 
  britain 's great these days and throughout most of history , you 're all top drawer , but i just hate the thought of all the people that died or lived in servitude because colonial powers turned up on their shores one day and took everything from them . 
  * would * have been , it * would * have been better for the british empire to fuck off instead of invading places and colonising them . 
  but obviously not now , the north should belong to whatever way the majority votes , i guess , and if that 's unionist that 's fine , i do n't care which country the north wants to be with , it 's its own state with its own business , none of what i said is to do with the north nowadays , or at all really . 
  the massacres i 'm talking about are the lesser known conflicts in africa or the kandy war etc , massacres committed against tribes armed with spears . 
  that 's despicable no matter what way you look at it , there 's no justification for going around the world butchering native people into submission , stealing their resources and taxing them . 
  well yeah , that 's why i said people these days are living with the consequences of dead people 's decisions and have to pick up the pieces . 
  although i notice you do n't have a bad word to say about the rape that is colonisation , that 's pretty messed up . 
  the north of ireland ? 
  well , duh , that 's what colonisation is for , to fill foreign countries with your people, 
  i have no national or ancestral attachment to this , i do n't believe in patriotism or basking in the glory of what long dead people did as if it is any reflection on you . 
  any irish person or any nationality who helped massacre people is disgusting and should not be celebrated , but you know what ? 
  it 's not called the irish empire , and a few paddy 's in the ranks does n't excuse what the british empire did . 
  the british were the ones giving the orders to wipe out any indigenous resistance the world over . 
  so do n't try and shift the blame onto other countries , or be so low as to say my ancestors had anything to do with it , they were country folk all the way down . 
  the blood in your nation 's history belongs to your country 's ancestors , not anyone else 's . 
  and once again , i do n't know why you would defend the heinous actions of dead men who never knew you existed and have nothing to do with you . 
  i do n't understand why you would excuse the atrocities of an empire you have nothing to do with , the only tenuous link you have is that you happen to have been born on the same rock generations after the fact . 
  regardless , picking one small aspect of a limited number of societies and using that as justification for the mass murder , colonisation , plunder of sovereign nation 's resources , slavery and the other innumerable crimes against humanity the british empire committed is ridiculous . 
  they did not invade these places to stop such practices , they invaded because they wanted to take what was n't theirs and murder anyone in their way . 
  do you know what else happened befre the british empre invaded parts of the world ? 
  peace , family gatherings , loving marriages , raising happy children , elder councils . 
  and those cherry picked aspects of societies have equally as little to do with the invasions of the british empire . 
  the british empire did great things , but it also committed evil the likes of which any sane person would hope the world never sees again . 
  but she would have said it like , `` caul et lawndinderry agayin and youh cin feck off ouet the door and nehver , ehver come baack , ye loyalist shitehead . '', 
  the most mature way to handle it would have been for the british empire to fuck off from every corner of the globe they infested and not massacre millions of innocent indigenous people , wiping out entire civilisations and cultures in the process . 
  but the people who did that are long dead , and people today have to live with their legacy and pick up the pieces . 
  edit : it 's bizarre how many of you british are defending the atrocities of a dead empire you have nothing in common or to do with , simply because you happen to be born on the same rock . 
  you can love britain and still acknowledge that some people in power back then did horrible things , it 's not an attack on britishness , it 's a criticism of the countless murders an empire committed during it 's unjustifiable expansionist campaigns . 
  something great can also be terrible . 
  guys i 've got it ; * they thought the recession was as bad as it would get , but then came ... * *** the crappening *** * a never ending pit of disillusionment and existential despair , where privacy and happiness became a thing of the past . 
  except for weed , they 're starting to legalize that , thanks . 
  i 've heard of white guilt but ... nevermind . 
  not sure if you 're just trying to be a cunt or are actually dumb and know zero history . 
  after a brief flick through your post history , you are indeed just a dumb cunt . 
  haha , that 's even worse . 
  so glad ireland has always accepted it 's fate of being fucked in any combat regardless, 
   have different inborn qualities . 
  what about ovaries though ? 
  they 're born inside you, 
  that 's a complete and criminal waste of everyone 's time , as if cyprus would n't be easily invaded by any country that was crazy and rich enough to bother, 
  did n't even need to look at your flair to know you 're irish . 
  did it work ? 
  did they stop the islamiseringen of danmark ? 
  well in fairness it 's not the material of the product they 're purchasing , it 's the ability of it to do allow people to escape to whole other worlds, 
   following the ** reckless ** handling by the guardianof the snowden leaks i 'm pretty sure the snowden leak was the most carefully orchestrated and meticulous release of government documents the world has ever seen , not a single part of what they did was n't planned in advance . 
  i 'm sure hacking in to angela merkel 's phone keeps england mad safe , who knows what danger lies in there . 
  yeah , i do n't get who they think they 're stopping here , because it 's definitely not actual terrorist or anyone who actually uses the internet for certain purposes . 
  they 're targeting normal citizens and trying to control what they 're able to think, 
  i love that shit , never moving to england now, 
  oh my god , it 's actually starting to happen, 
  her native languages are english and bulgarian , she grew up in both countries , primarily ireland , and her parents only speak bulgarian . 
  she speaks english with a clear irish accent . 
  she lived in switzerland for a year , speaking french , that 's also where she learned spanish from all her friends there . 
  she can understand spanish rap music , i have no idea how she gets so proficient at languages so quickly . 
  do you like your job ? 
  what does the future of your career look like , is there the potential for advancement ? 
  thanks for answering , i 'm looking this stuff up for her now to tell her, 
  my girlfriend speaks 5 languages ; english , french , spanish , bulgarian and russian . 
  i always think she should really do translating and interpreting work since that 's such a powerful combination and she would like to work in eu , but she sees it as a pipe dream . 
  how did you get into this line of work ? 
  do you have any advice about it ? 
  she has a college degree in french and economics , also . 
  i 've said in other comments here that i wish ireland was doing more to help this situation , the government is planning on admitting only 600 refugees over the next 2 years which is shameful , considering our own multiple exoduses ( exodii ? ), 
  throughout history and in the last few years , hundreds of thousands have left , it 's not like there is n't room . 
  but they 're not headed to hungary either , they 're heading through it , the hungarian authorities ca n't prevent them from getting in but wo n't let them leave when they do, 
  i actually said in another comment that i hate islam and it would be nice if they could leave that outside by the door when they come in . 
  but no one else has mentioned the religion , they just do n't like immigrants in general because they 're afraid they 'll take their jobs and other stuff like that, 
   there is no european identity . 
  that 's a false construct . 
  the modern british voter , everyone . 
  everything that involves humans is a false construct if you look at it a certain way , you 're being obtuse if you do n't believe the eu has fostered an unprecedented sense of identity among europeans in an astonishingly short amount of time . 
  i 've studied politics with people from all over europe and there is undoubtedly a european identity , but i presume you 're interraction with european people boils down to you shouting at the television whenever the eu is mentioned on the news . 
  it 's real , it 's out there , and europeans who actually meet each other know it . 
   why should the uk ` take orders ' ( ie . 
  cede its sovereignty ) to a governing body in which it is only a tiny part with little influence ? 
   how can you dare to call the right of the country 's people to decide on its future a petulant tantrum ? 
  that 's what a large amount of uk people hate about the eu - the wishes of the british people are ignored and trivialised for constructed union . 
  i could not have imagined a better rant proving my point . 
  you still think you 're an empire and everyone has to do what you want . 
  for one thing , the uk should cede some of its sovereignty because we live in a modern interconnected world where it helps immensely to be a part of an economic and political bloc and it makes you all the stronger for it . 
  it is a petulant tantrum because many of the people calling to leave are uneducated , uninterested in being educated on the topic , racist and ignorant of politics and economics and the consequences of leaving the eu . 
  their reasons for leaving largely boil down to `` i do n't like foreign people here , '' and also your `` i do n't like having to do what any other country says , wehhh , '' which unfortunately seems to strike with even more educated people on the topic . 
  the reasons for leaving are emotional or idealogical , not logical . 
  things are n't going your way so you threaten to leave , it 's the definition of a tantrum . 
  also it 's ironic you say the eu is a constructed union , considering your country 's barbaric history of massacring and colonising millions of people and countries around the globe . 
  many of these migrants are from countries your ancestors fucked up . 
  at least nations and people entered into the eu voluntarily , it 's communally constructed , not threatened under the pain of death like the british empire was, 
   with all due respect you in ireland , which has virtually been unaffected by the situation exactly , ireland could be doing much more to help in this situation and i wish we were , but as i said , people are still too racist and tribal to want to . 
  the government is planning on taking 600 refugees over the next two years , which is just shameful , we could manage thousands . 
  hundreds of thousands of irish people have left in the last few years , it 's not like there 's no space  we are completely overwhelmed with these refugees here in hungary i know hungary is in an awkward situation with dublin iii , but orban and his government is still [ racist ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/eu-report-finds-rampant-racism-xenophobia-in-hungary/a-18505689 ) and [ anti-democratic ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-28/orban-says-he-seeks-to-end-liberal-democracy-in-hungary ) , and that is a big part of why the refugees are stuck there . 
  none of them want to stay in hungary , it 's partially the government 's choice to be overwhelmed , but obviously you do n't want to send the message of free passage to all migrants . 
  it 's just a terrible situation all round if only the middle east was n't a shit hole :(, 
  if you think reasoned and unbiased criticism is what is going on here , you 're nuts . 
  the amount of immigrants coming into europe is a drop in the ocean , they could easily be settled and spread around europe , we 're absolutely huge and despite what the heartless psychopaths here would have you believe , they are n't going to turn europe into a slave economy with no wages where all the poor native people die because their jobs were stolen . 
  but a lot of people are seemingly still too racist , too tribal and too heartless . 
  even if there are economic migrants among them , who gives a fuck , these are the people who are willing to risk everything the build a better life for themselves and their families , many of their children will work hard and go to college , as if often the case with second generation immigrants . 
  at the same time , though , i do hate islam as a religion and would like it if they just kind of dropped that before they got here , that 'd be great , thanks,
