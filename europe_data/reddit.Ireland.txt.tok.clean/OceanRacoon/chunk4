  the mixed combat units were worse across the board . 
  men had to physically help the women with some tasks . 
  this is going to get people killed . 
  all you have to do to understand why this should n't happen is to watch the innumerable clips of women cops being absolutely useless at arresting or defending themselves against an average man , let alone protecting other people . 
  we all know who really won the race . 
  it 's irritating how strict they can be with those rules , just an instant dq straight away , but for some of them you hear how athletes try to game them to give them an advantage , especially the old false start rules . 
  jobs for the boyos . 
  it was a joke about you only hoping we remain friends for another 100 years . 
  why not say 10,000 years ? 
  or forever ? 
  that would be better . 
  and then after that we can start fighting again . 
  guess these experts were right , though , huh . 
  the guy who plays doug stamper said the same thing , that if they made a series based on politics today people would say it 's unrealistic . 
  that was a few months ago , before the subplot of brexit exploded to the fore and made things way more retarded than they already were . 
  set up a kickstarter , i 'll donate . 
  i made you out of clay . 
  oh , does people insulting each other in / r/mma , the most insult-heavy sub , suddenly mean that racists do n't exist anymore ? 
  not to mention the fact that the full quote is `` i 'm glad you can admit that you 're dumb , '' because the guy had sarcastically called himself dumb , which you for some reason edited , which i say every time someone sarcastically insults themselves . 
  you 're defending a guy who is regularly saying genuinely disturbing , hitler-esque racial purity nonsense and thinks feminism is destroying families . 
  that 's what you 're doing right now . 
   wisdom is justified in her children . 
  your mental , mate , you genuinely seem to think you 're a 19th century far right wing philosopher . 
  `` reason '' and `` truth '' , lol . 
  conspiracy nonsense and shitting on women counts as truth in your mind ? 
  whatever . 
  the future is war in europe if neo-nazis like yourself continue to attack the main institution that 's made us all friends . 
  if it 's scare-mongering , nationalistic nonsense you can imagine hitler said , it 's probably racist . 
  shocking how they 're so reliably ignorant and/or racist . 
  lol . 
  `` confirmed true . '', 
  it 's totally been proven true that women are married to the state and they have privilege without responsibility , and that 's immoral ? 
  that feminism has destroyed the family unit to terrifying effect ? 
  did you even read any of the quotes up there ? 
  he 's talking about people destroying their `` culture and race '' and that `` multiculturalism is a dangerous myth '' . 
  that 's mein kampf shit , for god 's sake , how can you be this ignorant ? 
  criticizing racist people for being racist ? 
  then i 'm glad to be . 
  the dude is probably a racist who hates women , so he knows his positions are disgusting and indefensible . 
  anyone who knows there 's `` social implications '' for mentioning their beliefs in public probably has some fucked up beliefs .

  perfect example of an internet racist who acts like he 's not in public because he knows it 's shameful . 
  edit : [ `` that the peoples of europe would give away there birthright lands to people of different culture and religion is absolutely mortifyingly insane .

  boom , jackpot , i knew i 'd find stuff about hating women . 
  [ `` it makes sense . 
  if you do n't have the resources and protection of a man due to `` liberation '' . 
  the state can vicariously be a surrogate provider and '' husband '' .

  feminism has largely resulted in the dissolution of the family unit and we can see the terrifying effects .

  haha . 
  it really is just beyond comprehension as to why he did n't bring him on earlier , like you just ca n't ever work out what he was possibly thinking because it 's beyond all realms of logic . 
  maybe he hates england . 
  i 'm not even british and i 've been glued to every article and news report and comment since it 's happened . 
  it 's difficult to believe it 's really happened , it 's like a weird dream , it 's getting to the stage where i 'm waiting for all of them to collectively go , `` you know what ? 
  this is fucking impossible . 
  it 's just too much . 
  there 's just too much stuff to sort out , we 'll never get anything else done for decades and the country is going to disintegrate at the end of it all anyway .

  [ this reworked seinfeld gif sums it up perfectly . 
  had the red wedding spoiled for me months beforehand . 
  i genuinely wanted to teleport through my laptop and beat the shit out of the guy who did it , it was on imdb and someone called him out for it and he was like , `` this is a game of thrones forum , if people do n't want to see spoilers they should n't be here . '', 
  that 's right , you twat , it 's game of thrones , not a fucking book forum . 
  that had n't happened yet in the series , you goddamn bastard . 
  i 'm still a bit angry about it , do n't know if it 's obvious . 
  the guy was such an arsehole about it . 
   marcus rashford - one of the most impressive new talents in the whole of the premier league . 
  brought on the pitch with 5 seconds to go when we 're 2 -1 down to a country with a smaller population than the city of leicester . 
  what was he supposed to do ? 
  wave a fucking magic wand ? 
  haha . 
  so true . 
  and he literally walked through the defense three times in a row in 5 minutes , imagine if he 'd been brought on half an hour earlier . 
  inexplicable . 
  one , cheered on by mindless drunken hooligans , the other , cheered on by mindless drunken hooligans . 
  in ireland the commentator said the exact same thing as well . 
  as / r/callcifer already explained , your non-elected nonsense is rubbish , and why on earth do you think any european government would hand over their sovereignty to the eu ? 
  what you 're saying does n't make sense , countries in europe co-operate on points of interest that are mutually beneficial , they 're not ever going to give away their sovereignty past a certain point , governance is always going to happen primarily at a state level . 
  it would be completely unwieldy and unrealistic to govern 27 different states from one city . 
  this is just the typical uneducated and fear-based trash that leavers come out with . 
  do you feel like the english government itself usually represents the interests of british people or gives a shit about them ? 
  maybe you should work on your state government before you start freaking out about a completely imagined european bureaucrat boogeyman coming to steal `` sovereignty '' from you . 
  the eu is one of the best things stopping each member country from being dicks to their people , for god 's sake . 
  and these things are bad because ... 
  but why did you lie about voting to remain ? 
  is it because you 're ashamed that you 're an idiot ? 
  from what i 've seen , yes , a majority of them are at the very least xenophobic , and many of them are racists . 
  and a lot of them are just dumb uneducated people who want to say fuck you to the government and the eu in general , without really knowing what they 're voting for . 
  how do you know the eu is going in that direction ? 
  why do you not like it ? 
  / r/callcifer has shown that your other points are just uninformed , and that 's the big problem with leave voters . 
  you think a load of things that just are n't true and you do no research because you do n't want your opinions to be contradicted . 
  you just do n't like the eu or the idea of it so you 'll bend reality to act like it 's an evil boogeyman . 
  yeah , you definitely did n't vote remain . 
  why would you lie about it ?
