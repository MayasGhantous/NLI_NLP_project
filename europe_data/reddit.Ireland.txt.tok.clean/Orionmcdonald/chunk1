here here !, 
  i would love britain to refer to the islands again in a scandinavian way ... all those countries were at various points connected , they seperated and now work together often in a mutually beneficial way while still having strong cultural ties . 
  i think the uk has a situation very much like in ireland in our last election , everyone hated fianna fail for fucking up the economy and they got destroyed , but the main opposition fine gael had almost exactly the same policies and lack of ` message ' they were completely machines for winning/contesting elections with very little substance or ideology , i could not for the life of me describe what they ` are ' except whatever is popular with the most people , which is sort of the crisis of 21st century politics in a nutshell . 
  its crazy that the cons think that abandoning any centrist policies they had on social programs or enviornment ( which was for many people an acceptable reason to vote for them in the last election ) will clinch them a majority in this election . 
  this seems to me the biggest things that westminster ignores about scotland , that its much closer to a social democratic european leaning society in politics than an anglo-liberal one . 
  i honestly think a lose federalization of britain might be the best course going forward right now , it 's a strange analogy but right now the uk is something like the papal states during the renaissance , sucking up all the money/investment into the capital and spending it on prestige projects and sort of leaving the rest to get along on its own . 
  dylan moran , brilliant stand up comedian too , has some nice bits about [ france ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klvv7e2fgpg ), 
  fuck that !, 
  red faced farmer is far more representitive , we 're not the hottest look group on the planet !, 
  come on guys , its well established that france is best represented by a man in a breton top and beret clutching bread & wine ( with or without a chain of onions round his neck ) , and england is a foppish gentleman , [ ireland in this case accurately a toothless man in a thick sweater & paddy cap .

  small minority in the general popultation but not in the population of paying voters for eurovision . 
  should make the point that the entire band is disabled , two members have forms of autism , two have down syndrome . 
  well it should be noted , eurovision has a massive gay following so something as camp/ground breaking as conchita wurst was going to get a huge boost from that . 
  that was the old joke but i really think they we 're trying with jedward ... jeeysus they were shit .

  it 's a very decent song , its not like they are a shitty punk band , they are a pretty good early-80s style punk band , and thats got to be at least as good as the mostly shit techno/euro-pop bands with novelty lyrics that 90 % of eurovision entries are, 
  there is a documentary about them , the punk sydrome , that looks good : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm58kp_jhkq, 
  this is straight out of the fucking northern league book of trolling : http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44574000/jpg/_44574361_indians226.jpg i remember seeing these in milan back in 07 ' or so , appalling shit . 
  it is and it does , including a mega-thread dedicated to immigration . 
  this is a circular argument . 
  you i 'm guessing think this is lefty-censorship and that immigration discussion is being brushed under the carpet , and i think that it was an issue taking up far too much of the front page of what should ( in my opinion ) be a broad based discussion of general european issues/interests , not focused on a narrow topic for weeks at a time . 
  well there is also / r/european , very proud of pointing to their lack of moderation and ` censorship ' and feature immigration prominently with 5,000 + subscribers . 
  well there is also a / r/euromigration subreddit specifically created for this subject where it can be discussed as a central focus . 
  i would maintain that / r/europe should not be dominated by a single topic for extended periods of time as it 's a subreddit dedicated to the entire continent of europe and not a specific policy/political subreddit based on immigration . 
  it 's not hidden , it 's permanently pinned to the top of the page as a mega-thread it gives people who want to discuss it a place within the sub to do so . 
  its a question of offering a balanced portrait , emotive topical posts will always get more up-votes but that does not mean that other articles are less `` european '' or worthwhile , a page that is dominated by one subject is n't a very good representation of the idea of europe as a whole . 
  every large sub gets to the point where it has to manage it 's posts in order to maintain variety . 
  what that wiki does n't even mention is that it was an act of parliament that applied the name in the early 1600 's , it was n't just a natural development . 
  they were previously referred to simply as the isles . 
  it 's bizarre because really the last of the ` britons ' are basically the cornish & welsh , the smallest groups within the isles . 
  and who can forget [ ` worker & parasite ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyxydj9dgci ) eastern europe 's favorite cat & mouse team . 
  berlin is something else , i know what you mean about those others the cities can be quite staid and conservative but berlin is very unique , culturally vibrant , interesting people and in its own weird way very nice looking . 
  i lived there when i was 21 and it was one of the best years of my life ( though this was 2008 and i believe it has already changed hugely since then , we lived on very little money at the time ), 
  yeah thats not likely to work , as / u/solz1 says , military spending takes priority ( look at north korea , almost no trade a still a substantial military ) no the intention i think is to show russian oligarchs and maybe citizens the consequences of the actions in order to discourage further incursions ( especially into nato countries that they would then be obligated to defend ), 
  oh no guys , we could lose this guy from our userbase !!, 
  better get rid of the megathread with this elegant argument . 
  well then you would have to include fianna fail under theocratic, 
  there are some new parties coming up too that i do n't know much about , anyone got anything on renua ? 
  also we have a huge amount of independents with an increase likely in the next election , irish politics are very local focused . 
  well what academic data is wrong ? 
  are you assuming because you see immigrants in the news or in person that there is more of them than the data suggests ? 
  because that is , without proof to the contrary a prejudice . 
  ** birmingham was won by labour ** , a leftist party with no known anti-immigrant bias in the last election ( despite labour 's overall poor showing ) . 
  ** malm\u014d is ruled by the social democratic party ** , the traditional leftist party of sweden also without any obvious nativist policies , ** bradford was also won by the labour party ** . 
  i do n't know what you mean ? 
  well if you contend that the academic data is corrupted then we venture into conspiracy theory , how else can we argue that there are destructive effects of immigration afoot if we do n't have empirical evidence ? 
  we see in places like holland & germany that the strongest support for anti-immigrant movements are in regions with very few immigrants , so we get into a general anti-authoritarianism movement with a disregard for facts , running on feelings of dislocation and uncertainty . 
  you show me a data driven politician whose making a strong logical case for immigration reform in europe and i 'll stand corrected , no joke , but i 've yet to see one . 
  and my take is that the popular discussion would not be truthful , the hard truths are not going to be popular ones , if we turn a hard discussion into a beauty contest we will lose to those who paint a picture of purity and simplicity for something that is far more complicated . 
  i vote left of center , i 'm very sorry to see high unemployment and widespread disenchantment with politics but i 'm not going to suggest that taking assholes who would further themselves by demonizing the poorest among us seriously will improve matters . 
  sure but then the lesson is not to give it credence of official sanction , do you think that the jews were the reasons for crisis in the 1920s ? 
  i 'm guessing not , so to make these concerns policy is to confirm a prejudice that does not have a grounding in fact . 
  it was the death of the weimar republic to share power with extremists . 
   but perspective of thousand , mostly low skilled , people on the job market is more relevant than source of this unemployment problem . 
  this implies that it 's a valid source of the problem , and its not , to suggest that parties take heed of something that is a visible issue rather than tackle the underlying problem . 
  godwins law has been invoked !!, 
  i was unaware that sharia law proponents had taken over a prominent european nation state and were in the process of invading and annexing czechoslovakia ... sharia law proponents are and will remain a fringe , we should be wary of religious imposition on individual freedom but we can do that without discriminating . 
  globalization and technology have changed the economy of the world enormously in the last 10-15 years , industrial manufacture which was the traditional working class power of the 20th century has been outsourced to se asia and wages have been stagnent , someone comes out and says it 's migrants fault that the jobs have disappeared and people are open to the idea they are upset and hurt but that does not mean it 's true !, 
  thats my personal opinion but regardless , creating a thread is not killing immigration talk its just allowing it an area for those of us who would rather have the plurality of european life . 
  thats fair , but do n't forget that at one point facism was a workers movement that prided itself on it 's connection to honest work not to mention the semantic connection to the industrial worker that national socialism had , the connection between far right xenophobia and the `` common working man '' is an old one , not a recent phenomenon , but that does not change the fact that its a sop to a problem that is n't as easily solved as `` keep out the immigrants '' the world is changing in a way it has n't since the early 1800 's , we need better solutions ( though i admit the politicians are n't exactly offering them ) demonizing poor buggers from eritrea escaping the draft is n't solving that problem . 
  hows that going ? 
  is sharia ... law in any country in europe ? 
  so it 's a moral panic that has it 's roots in insecurity about globalization and the ( entirely fair ) fear of it 's impact on well being and standards of living . 
  those people are not unemployed because of immigrants , to suggest that is the problem is hateful and disingenuous . 
  yeah it worked great when mainstream society indulged xenophobia in the 20 's , what an awesome turnout . 
  note that even at its most popular the far right is still only 20 % or less of the popular vote in most countries , hardly a plurality , show me a country where xenophobia has a majority and i 'll concede the point , but until then i do n't think giving the loudest the biggest voice is valid . 
  the idea that a thread that 's supposed to represent europe in all its variety and influence boils down to articles about the perils of immigration is crazy . 
  i applaud the moderators for deciding that a page that presented a variety of news of all subjects that presents a balanced portrait of the continent is the way to go . 
  good for them . 
  really ? 
  because people in many countries with the right to discriminate through the legislature have found a way to beat up outsiders physically too ( rohingya in myanmar for example ) do n't fool yourself thinking discrimination is only the result of an elite conspiracy , people kick people below them because the overally situation is shit since 2008 , we were fine with immigrants when we were doing well but now that were in crisis they are an easy target for populist rage . 
  yeah as someone who thought he was pointlessly complaining about this tendency ( europe is more than the current immigration issue !! ), 
  it was refereshing to see it dealt with, 
  from [ this leftwing rag ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21623756-governments-are-souring-treaties-protect-foreign-investors-arbitration ), 
  the effect of tipp agreements on desirability of investments has n't been shown actually , that was the intention but there is no noticeable increase in foreign direct investment towards tipp countries against non-tipp signees edit : read isds for tipp i was on the jar, 
  the free market also requires risk , if your investment does n't work out you lose , unfortunately the pattern lately is investment without loss ( see banking debts being transferred to governements ) but truly a free market means you may invest a lot of money and lose a lot of money , its a gamble . 
  well in fairness food is different , its not just some other consumer product , we probably ( or almost definately ) owe much of europe 's wealth to a temperate climate and food security will be a concern over the next century . 
  the other thing is if you know any small farmers ( my grandfather was one ) they work very hard , very long hours and for very little renumeration , it 's not like other industries in this respect . 
  ( now big corporate farms which consequentially france is dominated by are a whole different thing but i imagine they are not the ones burning other countries produce ), 
  in fairness , i get what your saying and i agree broadly with the french insistence on workers protections and collective rights but this has been the mode for the last 20-30 years and is french industry more sustainable ? 
  it seems there are less and less things manufactured there , less startups , less export of culture . 
  i 'm a leftist and i 'd love to think that mid-20th century social solidarity is adequate to deal with the 21st century problems of inequality and vulture capitalism but i do n't think it is , we need new ideas . 
  well the government in france is responsible ( i 'm guessing ) for the higher cost of doing business , the tax & social transfers from business in france can be massive , so its going to be hard to compete with other states . 
  i feel like he is somewhat similar to netanyahu in a way , just an impression but he does n't seem like a true believer as much as an opportunistic politician who knows the value of semantics . 
  what he 's saying is : denying the link between xenophobia/racism and anti-islamic groups is disingenuous , there is a clear overlap with anti-islam often being the semi-respectable face of hatred and fear, 
  well sure , but the majority of islamic people in europe are foreign , often ethnically arab ( although also a fair few pakistani 's if your in britain ) but in continental europe it 's likely morocco , algeria , syria , egypt etc. , i 've said it before but islam in europe has largely become the semi-polite watch word for all that is foreign and brown . 
  it 's what they call dog whistle politics in the u.s. ( which is not to say there are n't genuine concerns about cultural differences based on religious practice etc. 
  but the overlap between xenophobes and anti-islamic groups is significant , to deny that is disingenuous ), 
  i think this thinking is so shitty , basically the citizens and polis of a state do n't matter , and we should just make this a global race to the bottom in some corpratist nightmare . 
  the state exists to serve the needs of its citizens , not the other way around . 
  what i 'm saying is terrorism does n't exist in a vacuum , turkey was suppressing kurdish language and culture violently for years before the pkk arrived on the scene and this is well documented , terrorism takes on it 's own logic once it gets going . 
  sure , but many people in the world can if they feel they are treated unjustly , i 'm not joining the ra anytime soon but i can understand why these organisations thrive in some environments . 
  agreed , but that does not change the fact that the people doing these things can be considered freedom fighters by the cultural/people they purport to represent . 
  i got mine yesterday !!!, 
  look out 20th century !, 
  i feel like cafe culture in paris is a big part of it too , the side walk is full of people smoking in the city centre, 
  well i 'm from a country where pretty much exactly this happened to get us our independence , the people responsible are indeed considered freedom fighters . 
  thats not true the definition of refugee is * `` a person who has been forced to leave their country in order to escape war , persecution , or natural disaster .
