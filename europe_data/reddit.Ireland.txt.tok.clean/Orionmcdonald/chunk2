  sure it 's possible , but there under no obligation to do so in a democracy , to choose not to ( for strategic or ideological reasons ) is well within the rights of a party in the democratic system . 
  it may seem unfair to you but until the sd is big enough or changes platform enough to be compatible with other parties no one is obliged to make a coalition with them , thats democracy too . 
  sure but no party is obliged to work with a party whose policies they disagree with right ? 
  i mean there 's no reason a minority parties view needs to be represented in a democracy if they ca n't form a coalition . 
  best of luck , i hope you find someplace to settle ( in fact check out ireland , we have a pretty small refugee community so there is n't as much ill will as you might find in mainland europe ) , i think the guys are right to suggest student/work if you can find it/afford it because asylum seekers life is just enough to survive , it seems miserable . 
  sorry , i should be clear i 'm not targeting greece or any other country specifically , it 's just that one narrative `` resisting authority made for a weak state '' seems to appear in many countries ( including my own ) and i do n't think it 's true , it seems a convenient explanation that stops people from addressing their cultural issues . 
  i 'm afraid that the reception to your post is going to be mostly hostile a ) because there is a cultural/employment crisis happening at the moment people are worried about their own jobs and social security and when they see immigrants it 's both competition and extra diversion of tax money . 
  unskilled work in particular is rare b ) the earlier waves of immigrants from islamic countries in particular ( algeria , morocco , turkey , pakistan ) are not seen as a huge success in any country , there are many cultural conflicts and every child of a western european muslim that joins isis is a terrible advertisement for integration . 
  c ) they see refugees as economic migrants because of the near endless civil strife stretching from north and central africa all the way through the middle east to afghanistan making almost anyone in those areas a refugee . 
  i 'm sorry the reception has been so harsh , but at least you 'll get a sense of the mood in europe at the moment ( not universally but certainly among a vocal and politically more and more powerful section . ), 
  i think its a weak sociological phenomenon though , it 's commonly carted out in ireland as `` we resisted the british '' , but i 've never seen anything support it except anecdotal references . 
  this is an unpopular point your making but your right , everyone wants the best for themselves , if my country was a warzone tomorrow i would hope to find a stable well run country to settle down in , if we have a problem with that then we need to change our legal system . 
  i think that these sort of `` we we 're occupied so we defy authority narratives '' are self-serving nonsense , in ireland people similarly use it as a reason to excuse corruption or tax avoidance and it turns out that most countries have some version of it when this is the case but to me it does n't hold up . 
  you want to shake up the bloodlines , i for one am very happy with irelands influx of good looking polish & baltic people . 
  yep your right , just about * `` polish nationals increased by 93.7 per cent since 2006 from 63,276 to 122,585 in 2011 marking them the largest group ahead of uk nationals with 112,259 . 
  '' * he must of been basing it on the 2006 census . 
  this , pigs are very intelligent mammals that die generally after being kept in appalling conditions , they have some of the worst treatment of any farmyard animal . 
  disagreed !, 
  thats the future , bloomberg was designed by two of the greatest in the business at the moment , josh topolsky & richard turley . 
  doing the stadiums for qatar at the moment . 
  it 's interesting in that some of the percentages look very high but when you look at the country of origin you realise `` oh thats perfectly sensible '' so for ireland it 's the uk which makes sense , for uk it 's india , again long historic ties etc. 
  makes you realise how numbers and percentages of immigrants can be used for fear mongering when they are without context . 
  yeah its huge but my impression is that it 's mostly italians , french & germans so its not like it 's a huge cultural shock for them . 
  so much good food , the sausages there haunt my dreams ... cork is just a good food city , though the quality throughout ireland is superb these days . 
  i found that food wise one of the hardest things to get used to living in finland , no alternative to my beloved salty mature cheddar , all the aged cheeses were so expensive . 
  i once had some leip\u00e4juusto soup ( that was sweet ) it was one of the strangest food experiences , my ex-girlfriends family loved it . 
  for non finns , leip\u00e4juusto ( literally bread cheese ) is like halloumi but much less salty . 
  yeah it seems to be better distributed these days in ireland anyways , my folks live in a tiny place in wexford and the local shops have it . 
  its relatively soft , i 've used it as a spread before but its still quite crumbly , very nice on crackers with a bit of red wine . 
  absolute best for me though is in a sandwich with bacon , red onion chutney and rocket , its gorgeous . 
  the tang of the cheese , the bacon and the sweetness of the onions are perfect together . 
  how would you eat manchego ? 
  is there any typical recipes or ways it 's served ? 
  i see it down at tescos sometime but i 'm not sure what i would do with it . 
  red leicester makes a gorgeous grill cheese . 
  no ones put it out there , so i 'll do ireland : ** cheddar : ** we do very good savory chedder , much like the english , nice and crumbly and good . 
  ( i believe this kind of cheddar is exported in europe under the kerry gold brand , at least it was in finland ) artisan cheeses have also been big in the last couple years , ** gubbeen : ** is a lovely nutty cheese from one of the great families of irish food production . 
  ** cashel blue ** : is an award winning salty , savory blue with mild marbling . 
  i think setting us apart is that food production in ireland is still largely on a small scale meaning grass fed cattle and sheep and the food is simple but very nice . 
  eh its not for everyone , but spiegel generally does very aggressive interviews and they are usually well prepared , i do n't see the harm in it . 
  i know what your saying about comparing those regulations to germany ( and many other nations in europe which have semi-controlled markets ) but the difference is the cost of running a company in greece is the highest in the european union ( cyprus excluded ) there are far too many monopolistic areas of the economy . 
  this aside from failure to create a proper land registry and collect tax efficiently is a serious problem for the country . 
  yes i think your correct , i 'm simplifying , the euro is a bit a of half-done thing . 
  or not because the northern fiscal union has a fucking expensive currency and the southern fiscal union is cheap as chips . 
  thats kind of the imbalance underlying a lot of this , countries like italy & france used devaluation to remain competitive against germany , the euro is a disadvantage to them and an advantage to northern countries because it keeps their currency weaker than it would be . 
  when i say corruption i mean more in the line of regulatory capture , the influence of money on the political process , tax evasion , lobbying etc. 
  its not corruption in the sense of bags of money being handed over for building contracts which things like transparency measures . 
  but i think few americans would deny that a problem and the huge dissatisfaction with congress/senate seems to reflect that . 
  i think its very difficult to have satisfactory governance on that scale , to try and be all things to all people requires a compression of beliefs , identities and interests . 
  this . 
  huge federations require a huge amount of antagonism to consolidate , factionalism even in strong democracies like the u.s.a is rife and they needed 100 years of civil strife and warfare to get to where they are now . 
  i 'm a pro-eu but i largely agree with you , the temptation for the larger nations to fix the eu in their favour is already there ( the euro lives and dies on the whim of the german central bank ) i also disagree that the populism we see now would disappear , instead you would see populism writ large , with politicisation and rancor on a huge scale . 
  the current status where even countries like ireland and estonia can have an influence on proceedings is i think the only one that would work on this scale . 
  look at the large federations in the world : india , usa , china ( to some extent ) they basically require a strong measure of brutality and tension and corruption to maintain themselves and supression or co-option of regional politics . 
  i do n't want that for my eu . 
  we should be united as possible on trade , human rights and foreign policy but i think things that can be accomplished reasonably by national governments should remain that way . 
  i have to say that much of the discussion around the greek bailout was inflammatory , both the greek bashing polemics and the very silly declarations of hostage taking , coups and waterboarding ( the most egregious that i 've seen mentioned many times , economic adjustments are not fucking torture ) much of this was on the nature of debt and its relief which is often talked of in moral terms ( usually pointlessly , economists have long declared that ` household model ' makes little sense when applied to states ) but underneath all this was the fact that a ) greece has a very very uncompetitive economy , one of the worst in the eu and even if they got a 100 % haircut today , they would still be racking up debt like crazy because the state as it stands is unsustainable b ) it was always in greeks hands to go this alone , leave the euro and with that take complete sovreignty over their monetary policy , understandably they did n't choose that because they realised they would have to make the same cuts they fought against out of necessity ( even with inflation ) . 
  the result of the talks was a classic european solution , a large compromise but still a solution and one we can give the benefit of the doubt for now . 
  that said the eu is facing hard times that have more to do with globalisation , automization and demographics than which economic model we practice so i ca n't blame them for that . 
  you understand that even if that is the case tspiras can tell them to go to hell and leave the eurozone , greece can claim complete sovereignty over their financial affairs if they default and return to the drachma but if they need financing to maintain the euro then they need to cede some sovereignty to the ez who loans it to them . 
  coups do n't normally involve choices , and that is the choice . 
  not so bad , i spent most summers in ireland with my grandparents , i had travelled a fair bit in continental europe as a kid , there was a lot of small things to do with irish society that took getting used to but at this point i feel very much at home here , and in europe in general . 
  oh man the dr.seuss houses in that documentary back in romania are crazy . 
  yes i think the residual discrimination from the slavery set them apart as a class in europe and they sort of developed an outsiders mentality . 
  it 's obviously a terrible prejudice but also very few people ( in my experience ) have had positive interactions with the community : personally i grew up in canada from the age of 1-17 so coming to europe i had no preconceptions of what roma were , but generally aggressive begging and theft ( i was mugged a few weeks back ) is what i 've seen in the ten years i 've lived here . 
  i understand that the root of this is very poor education and systemic poverty ( not to mention things like the mass killing of roma in the holocaust ) but when people who succeed within the community then shun it , its hard to paint a better picture . 
  yes roma are a ethnicity from northern india originally in medieval times and believe at one point they were enslaved in the slavic world , i think the point he was making is that the culture / and the lifestyle are very entwined and most people who integrate disavow romani culture ( understandable when you consider the discrimination in most if not all european cultures ) as far as i know romani had a place in society as itinerant tradespeople and doing jobs that were not paticularly prized ( the travel book ` south from granada ' written in the 1930 's describes their role in a small town as butchering horses when they got old ) in recent times they have largely failed to integrate with modern states , with low rates of education and a widespread reputation for petty crime ( which most people will have experience with ) its a pretty grim problem . 
  are they doing haircuts ? 
  'cause if they are just giving out haircuts ... 
  well [ vichy france ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vichy_france ) was a rump puppet state in occupied france created by marshal petain , while they did deport jews and basically do what the germans asked they were n't actively going around butchering people in the manner of the usta\u0161e regime , nor did they exist before the war unlike the usta\u0161e . 
  basically the vichy was a standard occupied puppet country , whereas the usta\u0161e were a pretty actively terrible facistic regime that was supported by germans but existed outside of occupation as a force in croation society . 
  oh yes the swedes were a terrible part of that war , its weird to think of it now that they were a real scourge on germany at one time . 
  i 'm not saying the nazi 's cared about it morally , but there reaction to it was disgust . 
  i 'm not an apologist for nazi 's or usta\u0161e here , my main point is the vichy and the usta\u0161e were very different things , and to compare the two is the make a very unsuitable comparison . 
  well people were pretty active on the croatian side , the [ usta\u0161e ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usta%c5%a1e ) were not the same as the vichy , they were far more enthusiastic about the ethnic cleansing . 
  even the nazi 's thought they were savages . 
  yeah i think kosovo was a sort of penance of western countries who regretted not intervening to stop the massacres in bosnia earlier . 
  that and they hated milosovic . 
  30 years war is one of the most gothic , horrible periods in history . 
  its really not taught at all in english speaking countries which is too bad . 
  the first serb reaction `` serbs died too !! '', 
  is insulting because they were the instigators of the conflict , who killed the most people and according to the un committed the most war crimes ( up to 90 % ) so to come out with that is to try and compare the two as equal . 
  its as if germans said `` what about dresden ! '', 
  when people mentioned nazi war crimes , the two are on completely different scales . 
  of the eurozone ? 
  no , maybe not but if the ecb fails to continue liquidity assistance the greek government is in default and they will be forced to find a new currency . 
  ah okay so thats your angle , well i do n't know anything about that conflict , i 'm just pointing out why this happened . 
  sure but it was n't just the us . 
  basically most countries were neutral and saw it as an inter-communal conflict that they did n't want to be involved in , there was supposed to be safe zones for refugees within bosnia ( set up by the un ) , these were violated repeatedly ( most egregiously in srebrenica ) by the serb-bosnia forces ( who recieved logistics and arms from the serbian government under milosavic ) nato intervened . 
  tldr : bosnian-serb forces repeatedly attacked un safe areas , declared they would continue to do so . 
  i 'll see if i can dig it up ( i 'm by no means certain ) but i think it varies greatly depending on what you define as resistance & resistors , if you mean people printing counter propaganda and passively resisting its likely in the thousands , but the popular image of people blowing up train tracks and killing high ranking nazis seems to have been a very small core ( as you say mostly communists ) . 
  once you get to d-day and people see the tide turning against the germans there are hundreds of thousands involved in the attacks and reprisals but earlier than that it seems to have been a very minimal worry for the germans . 
  thats interesting . 
  as far as i know italy really was n't prepared for that kind of mass industrial warfare , the factories could n't ramp up production to meet the demand and the soldiers were pretty under equipped so that even when it came to fighting countries like greece which on paper should have been one-sided they ran into big problems . 
  i think one interesting aspect of italian facism is that artistically it was quite vibrant , the architecture , art and design of that period holds up in a way that say nazi german works did not . 
  yeah its interesting how important that story was to france 's identity post-war , i read that the pre - d-day resistance was probably around 600-800 people at its peak , a tiny percentage . 
  do n't you guys have some pretty terrible politicians on all sides ? 
  whenever you have countries with multiple ethnic assemblies it seems to end up being nationalism !, 
  to deflect away from corruption and bad governance . 
  well the un declared it genocide too ... but i think the problems of the balkans wont disappear if people ignore them , we 've see what happens when people brush things under the carpet .
