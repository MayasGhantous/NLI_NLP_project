  like with the ustace crimes of ww2 , ignore it and you end up with long held animosity that can explode decades later . 
  they did n't `` support '' bosnia , they supported not-ethnic cleansing . 
  russia protected serbia diplomatically in a big way , they went all out to prevent intervention from the west throughout the conflict . 
  not always !, 
  or go the spain route : straight up instrumental, 
  i have drunk west country cider that came in what looked like a gas canister from somerset ( wilkins ) and it was good , but i think they are not at all what people would consider cider , very raw and unfiltered ( similar in a way to the kind you get from france from bretonny ) but i 've not tried thatchers , they sell them local here in wexford , i 'll give it a shot this weekend . 
  magners is very good for a common brand , and the breton ciders ( though a bit simple ) are very nice too . 
  i would simply say this : cost of running a company in greece is highest in the eu ( excluding cyprus ) , that speaks to a hugely inefficient economy that requires massive reform , i what / u/cyend is saying is that if the debt disappeared tomorrow * poof * there is still that fact , and greece will still be in trouble with no one to lend it extra capital , forced to make those cuts they are against now by necessity , once that happens there will be no choices , no other options . 
  ( in the long run it might be the only way to make it work ), 
  this !!, 
  i would say 90 % of brits would admit that britain did terrible things back in the day ( saying this as an irishman ) they can admit it , it 's openly discussed and people can respect that the past is past and move on , when it comes into weird denial and lashing out then people get pissed off ( see japans unwillingness to admit culpability for massacres in ww2 ) and it lasts generation after generation, 
  it certainly meets the definition of raphael lempkin who invented the word in the 1920 's before the holocaust . 
  continuing in the grand tradition of [ the protocols of the elders of zion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_protocols_of_the_elders_of_zion ), 
  or ireland , bank robberies were/are relatively common, 
  problem is cost of doing business , highest in the eu ( cyprus aside ) until the economy becomes more efficient , the costs of goods and services will be too high for the consumers . 
  in fairness thats exactly what irish people do when the economy goes bad ( as it has many times ) we up sticks and go somewhere else . 
  it 's not a tragedy in itself , in fact its good for the country : makes connections abroad , and most people come back with a working knowledge of other governments and systems , makes it easier to help fix ones at home . 
  yeah jeff is right on this one , its more general inefficiency in the economy , highest cost of doing buisness in the eu ( cyprus aside ) the economy is riddled with favouritism and close shop industries , this really is the problem that wont go away even if the debt disappears tomorrow . 
  they have the lowest cost of doing buisness ranking in europe ( aside from cyprus ) its just a hugely inefficient economy , the debt is a drag but the main culprit is that it requires reforms that have been put off for 30 years . 
  i do n't see that being solved within the eurozone, 
  yeah but those funds are approved seperatly , even if the countries corrupt if a group or industry can convince that a project is viable they should be able to get funding for it . 
  i do n't think thats the eu 's fault , they took greece at face value on the corruption efforts . 
  yes but actually they should have access to a good chunk of eu money for improvement to infrastructure , give them viable projects and they 'll be approved ( ireland got shedloads of cash for various things ), 
  tyranny of the majority does not make for a well rounded news source, 
  this has been my bugbear for a while , i think in an ideal world the mods can work to create a strong well rounded discussion/news source and i think they do try really hard to do so , and yes that probably involves some filtering and ` censorship ' , but quality news and discussion requires it . 
  god comment is free is terrible , its annoying that pitchfork is doing something similar ( if your into music ) because its the same click-batey opinion pieces written by nobodies . 
  kind of already a thing ( unofficially ) a lot of the warfare in the sahel is driven by a decline in resources like water and grazing land . 
  i 'm irish born , grew up in canada and moved to ireland when i was 17 , lived there for the last 10 years with time living in germany , uk & finland . 
  flairs always been irish though , maybe someone with a similar name ? 
  yeah i would say much more common than outright racism is just a small islander mentality sometimes , which is more just being a bit ignorant or misunderstanding , but generally people are accepting of outsiders certainly more so in my experience than britain or places in the continent . 
  i would say like 60/70 % of the openly racist people i 've met in dublin have been cab drivers , that said most of them are professional and friendly , but the trope of the racist cabbie is not a trope for nothing , almost everyone would have a story about some encounter . 
  yeah in fairness we almost never grant asylum ( unless thats changed in the last couple of years ) we were notorious for it . 
  yeah we 're racist sometimes ( hello every other cab driver ! ), 
  , but not organised racist which seems like a lot of work and bother . 
  yeah i have to say that when someone fucks up in european politics ( cameron all the time for example ) its because they come in like a big dick and make demands and indulge in grandstanding , which makes it impossible for other countries to negotiate with them , europe 's all about being open minded and realising that every other country has their political reality aka how will this play to the public in poland , finland , france or hungary ? 
  and i think with the tspiras and cameron and sometimes other countries , they 've ignored that reality . 
  yeah ni is an expensive mess , i really wonder what will happen if/when scotland succeeds , because then the whole unionist identity is pair shaped , especially since religion has declined and disparity between the catholics shrunk ( not to mention differences between the republic and britain ), 
  but are improved upload speeds actually on offer ? 
  i worry that in reality the user will be charged at point of purchase and the vendor will be charged at delivery and the provider will be paid twice while leaving the service at the same level ( especially since telecoms companies are notoriously reluctant to invest in infrastructure , acting more as rent seekers ) . 
  i fear that smaller companies will be swamped by giants who have the backing to pay the tolls to the detriment of overall competitiveness and service . 
  fucking hell , how hard is it : if users pay for a service they should be entitled to decide how it is used ( within the law ) if they want to stream they can stream , and if you want to charge them for streaming then good luck on the open market . 
  it 's not just revenge , greece has had persistent overspend in the public sector since the early 80 's , combined with an economy thats rife with closed-shop industries and oligopolies ... the boom and the debt just covered up a very sickly economy , and it was a persistent practice of both the left and right wing governments to treat government as a tool of patronage and corruption , a system people were accustomed to for almost 30 years . 
  i do n't think it would require treaty change there is no actual scenario for kicking someone out ( in fact all countries , including greece would have to agree to such a thing under current rules ) so i think the default would be that unless greece chose to leave the eu they will still be a member . 
  how so ? 
  you think its not possible to break up uncompetitive cartels and lower costs of doing buisiness ? 
  reform tax collection ? 
  those are all things that are essentially free and just require the political will to do them . 
  i agree with you ( sort of ) , greece should leave the euro and live off it 's surplus with a default , the country wont be able to borrow for a decade or more but it should be able to address the political problems that are at the heart of the crisis . 
  i do n't really understand that . 
  i know it theory it 's not accounted for but i do n't think anyone would like to see greece leave the eu , i 'm sure a summit can be put together where they fudge a compromise about why greece can stay , especially considering there are non-eurozone eu members . 
  ** counterpoint : ** the bailout conditions are harsh because previous promises to collect more tax ( collect tax thats actually owed ) and crack down on evasion while increasing competitiveness ( breaking up closed shop industries and cartels ) have fallen completely short of what would be necessary to make greece a strong economy , these structural weaknesses are long standing and yet to be addressed , so the troika insisted on measures like vat increase and sales of state assets because these are the only ones they can credibly verify . 
  note : i do think the greeks should leave the eurozone under the current circumstances because even though they will be in worse shape economically , it will at least force the politicians to admit that the problems are structural and deal with them , otherwise its just debt driven life support with no reform and that clearly has not worked . 
  this is a great articulation of why pride matters . 
  you understand that people are still jailed , arrested and killed for that sexual preference ? 
  that it was a crime not so long ago in most countries and remains so in much of the world ? 
  pride is about just that : pride , a declaration that they exist that was especially important when they were persecuted as deviants ( much of pride being a sort of `` fuck you '' to the critics of sexual diversity ), 
  i 'm not really for compensation to be honest , its a bit too legalistic and arcane , and if anything it compels countries to deny their history in order to avoid paying out , which is n't healthy . 
  as long as the victims and perpetrators are dead then the statute of limitations should be in effect . 
  / u/dclauzel is an institution of this thread !, 
  belgium is in its own league in the congo , truly horrific stuff , the man who documented it and put huge political pressure on the belgians was [ sir roger casement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roger_casement ) , who ended up being knighted for his work in what we would call human rights today ( he also investigated abuses in mines in south america ) ironically he was also an irish nationalist and was executed for gun running later on by the uk gov. 
  yep !, 
  i 've no problem with the modern day english , their culture ( music , art , film and even food despite the reputation ! ), 
  is great , they are nice people generally and the country is beautiful but i do get annoyed when some people get nostalgic and act as though the british empire was some benign force for good , when it was just it was just a force period , some good , a lot of bad , and all of it for the benefit of the british mainland . 
  well straight up you might wan na read about charles `` the famine is a effective mechanism for reducing surplus population as well as the judgement of god '' trevelyan , the man who the british put in charge of famine relief ( noting that although potatoes ( which failed everywhere ) were a staple of working poor throughout continental europe , only in ireland was there famine , due to the continued exportation of the surplus crops produced in the country even during famine ), 
  you said history , i can tell you personally that the history of the british army in ireland is view with disdain in the republic , for my parents generation the bloody sunday killings will probably be a definitive memory . 
  if you mean the present day british army i would say it ranges from indifference to contempt ( if your on the far left ) relations between british & irish are grand though !, 
  on this i can agree . 
  in depth insight . 
  eritrea has a terribly repressive dictatorship with extensive conscription that ends when it ends , so you can be called up made to work ( for free ) for a decade or more with no notice of when you can get back to your life ( or your family ) its fucked . 
  hate to burst your bubble but no so much in ireland ... or kenya ... or malaysia ... india ... or ... 
  try civilians, 
  ni is fine though !, 
  i should be clearer , i narrowly mean people who * only * or almost exclusively spam / r/europe with articles about a single subject , such a narrow focus weakens what should be a broadly focused page ( representing as it does a whole continent ), 
  i think if a thread purports to be representing the interests and views of europeans is narrowly focused its a failure , if it was / r/immigration or / r/warinukraine it would be sensible , as / r/europe it does not present a true picture of what the continent is . 
  i 'm not talking about banning viewpoints , i 'm talking about people with no other submissions beyond a narrow focus on one topic : israel , immigration , russia etc. 
  i 've seen a few top posts where when you check the persons submission history they have posted nothing but single issue articles , thats bullshit and its pushing an agenda . 
  not really , my posts are n't a pro-forma one sided view of things , they tend to be general news or questions across a variety of subreddits , if you mean by making this post ? 
  then i guess the agenda would be i wish the front page was stronger , less predictable and more interesting , so yes in that sense i have an agenda with this post . 
  i did n't say islamaphobia or racism , find your strawman somewhere else . 
  i think its self-reinforcing , people with different viewpoints will be discouraged and leave the thread ( i think its already happening ) , until we have another reddit thread that reflects a very limited narrative and set of ideas like / r/european , the overlap between the two is much greater than it was and thats a drag . 
  i have something against pushing an agenda ( or better put , having insular interests is not the problem , promoting those interests exclusively is ) posting page after page of that agenda , its a distortion , as i see it ideally the page would be like a good newspaper , it would offer a variety of subjects with different opinions and analysis ( especially analysis ) as well as straight news . 
  if 2 or 3 subjects are all we harp on about it becomes a pointless source of news ( and discussion ) : oh everyone hates russia because of something dickish putin says ? 
  wow , oh immigrants are having trouble integrating and causing trouble ? 
  wow ... so nothing new here , at all . 
  i 'm fine with different opinions , but when the front page is dominated day after day with the same 2 or 3 subjects it becomes an echo chamber where people come to read things that confirm their own bias , its a waste of a forum . 
  i 'm not against people posting something related to immigration or russia but if its all they post its a pointless case of preaching to the choir . 
  i only assume that if someones submission history is articles of one type over and over again that they are pushing an agenda , many subreddits have rules against that behaviour because it degrades the variety and quality of the sub . 
  i think most of us from a quick look at posting history and comments can get a sense of wether someone is active in a general way or pushing an idea . 
  well 6 of my last 10 submissions to reddit have been europe related , but if people are devoted to posting only one subject continually your not going to drown them out , i 'm not saying we should n't have immigration or russia related articles but their should n't be politicised brigading , it destroys the thread . 
  well modern germans ( like us all ) should be aware that `` injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere . 
  we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality , tied in a single garment of destiny . 
  whatever affects one directly , affects all indirectly . '', 
  that the lesson of the holocaust is not that we should treat israeli 's with kid gloves and appease , but rather that we should never stand idle while persecution and discrimination are practiced against minorities . 
  i think london has two things , or maybe three that are big problems ** 1 ) ** lots of foreign owned ` investments ' that are empty or rented out for profit , that means a lot of the housing stock is unused or sucked up with outside financing ( most places seem to have more limits ) ** 2 ) ** density , london is a very flat , sprawling city , there are a lot of houses which if your in clapham or queens park is quite charming but it also means less people per sqr . 
  metre ( same as paris or many other older cities ) ** 3 ) ** green belt , the city is essentially stirctly limited in how far its margins can stretch so the cost of housing stock is massively inflated, 
  makes me fear for our religious relics , monasteries and women . 
  how many popular policies are logically explained ? 
  i do n't want to come off as jaded old man , but i 've seen a few political cycles , people can deal with change & immigration if the economic cycle is in the ascendent but on the back end of globalisation , the end of the banking/housing boom and the increased digital marketplace , when working class voters are underemployed and middle class voters are struggling , anything that seems like a subsidy for outsiders will fail . 
  its not a question of wether it 's a good argument , the importance is of the perception of taxpayers in the middle & upper class ( not to mention working class voters ) social capital is needed for social transfers , if the social capital ( trust ) is eroded by the presence of semi-widespread immigration ( even if that perception is flawed or bigoted ) then the social transfer will fail , it will be politically unfeasible , so its not about the moral rights & wrongs but rather the political possibility . 
  yeah , the devils in the detail , its sort of a right wing/free market idea originally ( hayak mentions something like it in road to serfdom and milton friedman proposed it to nixon in the 70 's ) i think an exception for example would have to be medical costs which i do n't think a free market/payment approach would be able to cover in any satisfactory way .
