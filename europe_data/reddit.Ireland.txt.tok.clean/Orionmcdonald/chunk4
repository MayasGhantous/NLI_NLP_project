  is that true for all positions ? 
  from what i remember ( i lived in sein\u00e4joki & helsinki for a while ) things like cleaners had varying wages , like there were ways around the union rules with temporary workers that were abused . 
  i agree , but then would immigrants be preferred by companies because they cost less ? 
  because every company hiring someone on a basic income would have to match and increase that income , an immigrant would have no such bargaining power . 
  it 's not an argument , its a social-fact . 
  societies that are less cohesive find it harder to implement broad social transfers , one of the reasons the social-democratic model in nordic countries was so successful was the strong cohesion of those societies . 
  even right wing think tanks in the states admit that the failure of broader social welfare programs there are to do with the perception that it would be to the benefit of black and hispanic citizens . 
  if single social payments are implemented it would come under attack from the right for being a magnet to immigrants or conversely if they are denied that right ( say a three year wait or whatever ) , it will be used to target immigrants who undercut native workers . 
  i really find the idea of the basic income interesting but i think the big problem would be immigration , if immigrants were eligible the popularity of the idea would quickly decline ( because it would rely heavily on social cohesion , people are less likely to support a social program if they do n't believe its helping people like them ) and if immigrants were n't eligible they would work for far less money than natives , which would undermine the strength of the basic income in job negotiations which is one of its benefits . 
  edit : i 'm should note that i 'm not anti-immigrant , i vote for greens & labour , but i 'm just pointing out what i think would be the political fallout from the idea . 
  well i think ** a ) ** basic minimum incomes are often proposed as a way of simplifying and streamlining the process of social payments , reducing layers of bureaucracy by reducing the transfers to a single payment , this threatens many government jobs and government employees tend to be a the backbone of modern unions ** b ) ** a good basic income would give workers the bargaining rights that unions traditionally provided ( if someone does not want to continue you in a crappy job they can leave and have a wage to fall back on ) so it would erode their base . 
  well for me budapest is fantastic , if you have local to show you around you can get a real feel for the people , the food and the great architecture , very much underrated and beautiful . 
  ( i also like amsterdam very much ), 
  wed. & thurs. 
  are for the royalty & lizard people meetings , respectively . 
  the sweet joy of procrastination, 
  well done lads !, 
  i 'm old enough to remember the refugees ( many of whom ended up in ireland ) watching the massacres being reported on tv , seeing the sniper alley shootings in newspapers , reading ` safe area grozade ' and being disgusted by the whole thing . 
  seeing serbians hide known war criminals for years in plain sight . 
  woman and children shot by snipers in the streets of sarajevo , many photographs were taken during the war in ` sniper alley ' of this behavior , when serb nationalists contest this people like me doubt what they have to say is credible . 
  this is exactly it , serbia comes out like they had nothing to do with ethnic cleansing and they ca n't understand why anyone would even thought of bombing them for whatever reason , like it was conspiracy instead of a long delayed intervention that the west very reluctantly undertook . 
  serbia implicitly backed the ethnic-serbian militias in bosnia with equipment , and diplomatically provided cover for their actions . 
  bosnian serb military backed & supplied by the serbian central government as part of an expansionist nationalist policy . 
  i utterly agree , but serbian commentators acting as though they were the victims of the balkan wars ( rather than the primary instigator of them ) is a reoccurring trope on reddit and elsewhere and its nonsense . 
  serbia should take a long hard look in the mirror before turning around and accusing other states of being assholes , they got off lightly for their genocidal garbage , which is the only reason nato ever got the go ahead to commit to that bombing in the first place : http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/293/1963/1600/concentration-camp-trnopolje.jpg , remember this ? 
  or irishman , thanks britain !, 
  we could n't vote or own property but we can die in your war against the only country that helped us during that time period ( possible 40 % of the british forces at waterloo ) , do n't worry though , we got to go home to be starved to death by terrible government negligence a few years later . 
  yeah ? 
  well its a good thing prussia & britain who knew nothing about pillaging and dominating other countries in the name of empire were there to show him the door . 
  phew that was a close one . 
  divine right of kings ftw !, 
  the nato mission was to stop him from reaching benghazi , had they not done it he would have carried out that massacre . 
  now if your criticizing the aftermath , i think you underestimate the extent to which order and good governance can be enforced . 
  america spent years trying to create a half-decent democracy in iraq & iran and failed , billions of dollars and hundreds of lives later . 
  savannajeff bringing the calm voice of reason to an annoyingly shrill debate !, 
  it 's very biased , the writer is a facist apologist . 
  ( check out his other works ), 
  so qualification here the spectator is basically the magazine of the conservative party , and this particular article was written by a man who wrote a favourable biography of mussolini that said he was not a bad guy so ... pinch of salt . 
  well if that was the idea ( i do n't think it was the idea ) they fucked up because libya has n't been able to export very much since the revolution , there is constant fighting over it . 
  no i think the difference was a clear threat to annihilate a major city only a stones throw from europe , it would have been appalling to let that happen if we had the means . 
  okay , so we let gaddafi massacre the people in benghazi , remember that ? 
  and he goes on and wipes out his enemies and entrenches , you do n't think there is a shitload of refugees coming out of that situation ? 
  aside from the many thousands that would have died . 
  sounds like a classic case . 
  * comment on every article about a bailout ever * strong analysis, 
  they have a lot of sounds that to a native english speaker are barely discernible from each other . 
  even so the us ( and uk ) have nuclear submarines on constant patrol , who would strike back immediately leading to the same outcome . 
  strong like economically ? 
  because its an economy that entirely relies on ( finite ) natural resources , strong militarily ? 
  because it 's still weaker than nato , let alone america on its own both in weaponry and man power , strong in nuclear weapons ? 
  it has less than america ( though as i say it does not matter 10 or 15 or 20 is more than enough ) strong societally ? 
  because russia 's demographics show the country shrinking drastically over the next few decades , strong through soft power and diplomacy ? 
  the only name recognition brands russia has are state oil & gas companies , it 's values are not exported its culture & media has no market outside of russia , so i guess strong in the sense that he says he is strong ... and smart and thats what he tells people in russia , and they believe him ... kinda . 
  whats the use of having more of something you can only use once ? 
  like there is no second chance , you use nuclear weapons and then its over , i mean its all over , thats it ... play the music , no more world the nuclear powers blow each other out and we all scramble around the fallout or die , i ca n't think of a shittier thing to spend your time improving . 
  i do n't know if they even believe it or just any justification for being a shitty self-centred rich person is latched onto by conservatives . 
  had some douro wine from around porto ( in portugal ) yesterday and it was really really good , so if you see that down the shops pick some up , very robust and good with strong flavours ( i had it with mexican bean soup ), 
  reddit salutes you, 
  excellent , its pretty archaic in english but fun . 
  nice use of humbug !, 
  regardless of the identity politics , the notion that the british empire adequately represented ( rather than actively and callously repressed ) the irish catholic majority of ireland is a whitewash , it was always a one sided relationship based on exclusive land ownership , military might , and entrenched power for the ruling minority aka . 
  colonisation . 
  i 'm not a raving nationalist , my notion of irish identity is fluid enough to accept contributions from all the communities that made the place home , but the famine ( among other things ) should give the english no impression that their time ruling ireland was beneficial . 
  ( also while its true that sinn feinn only won 47 % they were the largest party , and the remainder of the vote was split evenly between northern unionists and people in favour of irish independence through parlimentary means , which would make irish seperatists 67 % of the vote . ), 
  i do n't subscribe to that view , my notion of irish identity is broader than that , but they would generally ( though not always ) self-identify as english or scotch-irish ( wellington & swift for example ) others like bernard shaw and oscar wilde considered themselves irish ( and some like wolfe tone basically created the notion of modern irish statehood ) both are valid but regardless they were not representative of the irish majority or its aspirations and comparable perhaps to the afrikaners in sa or french colonists in algeria ( both of which were about 10 % of there respective populations at their peak ), 
  it 's not really , catholics were legally second class citizens until well into the 19th century ( the majority of irish being catholic ) this was deeply discriminatory , and the treatment of the irish during the famine was appalling ( and earlier as documented in jonathan swifts essays ) the freedoms promised by the english were almost always hedged or reneged on and those irish you describe taking those positions in british society were largely anglo-irish ( that is to say the descendants of cromwell 's invading army who owned land in ireland ) many of whom would not have actually resided there . 
  yeah that legalization in germany has been troublesome , the [ spiegel wrote a great article ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/human-trafficking-persists-despite-legality-of-prostitution-in-germany-a-902533.html ) about how open it has been to abuse because the police do n't give a fuck about protecting those girls , and its the same dirtbags taking all the money regardless of the change in the the law . 
  i basically think it probably should be legal but with vigorous enforcement of standards , made a real priority for law enforcement , otherwise legalization is hollow . 
  in fairness , in almost all countries where economic conditions are poor you also have government instability , ethnic violence and oppression . 
  for example ethiopia where many of these migrants come from is n't a war zone per-say but it does have forced conscription and an extremely authoritarian government which would justify refugee status . 
  mali is no longer at war but there is inter-communal violence , and oppression , the sahel similarly , somali is straight up a failed state , libya ditto , northern and southern nigeria are basically in civil war and on and on and on , so many many people from most of the middle east and north and west and east africa could qualify as refugees . 
  uh oh , germans are getting ideas again ... 
  not at all , i 've very rarely heard anti-polish sentiment , most people get along with them fine , and a lot of couples are polish-irish . 
  city planning in dublin is horrendous , we should have never allowed 5 fucking fast food resteraunts , three spars and an arcade on the main boulevard of the city , the planners do n't give a shit about the northside . 
  nice to see docklands and smithfield improving though !, 
  yeah , i moved to europe with a clean slate on this , knew nothing about romani culture at all and i can say after 10 years living in ireland , britain , germany & finland ( with extended time spent in spain , italy & hungary ) i 've yet to have a positive encounter with the community . 
  i 'm afraid aggressive begging , and being mugged ( last week ) is the extent of it , which is sad because my theory is that if your a roma that belongs to the 20 % that make it out of high school or the tiny percentage that make it through university your probably going to completely disavow that identity and not self-identify as roma for well founded reasons of prejudice . 
  i know people are saying they are from india ( like hundreds of hundreds of years ago ) but they are european and have been for a long time , and they had a terrible time in ww2 its europe 's problem to find a place for them in our society as seemingly impossible as that seems . 
  when british people talk about gypsys i presume they are talking about the irish travellers , which are very similar in many respects to roma in anti-social behavior ( broadly ) but culturally irish , same problems they used to have a place in society as repair men , musicians , horse traders but as society moved on they turned to crime , begging etc. 
  its somewhat improving but still bad . 
  the hard part is traveller kids are treated like shit by the general population ( and tend to steal early ) and the cycle continues . 
  never again will my baron be imprisoned without due process , huzzah !!, 
  fair enough !, 
  well i suppose the other one we hear often anecdotally in irish press is about widespread tax evasion , do you think this is valid ? 
  exaggerated ? 
  ( not arguing but rather genuinely curious ! ), 
  really ? 
  thats interesting , i think nordic countries ( and possibly germany ? ), 
  have something similar . 
  very interesting , i utterly disagree with the idea that greeks are ` lazy ' i do think though that the regulatory and institutional strength of the country seems to be deeply deficient , he talks about a reduction from 900,000 civil servants to 650,000 which is large ( 25 % as he says ) but my god thats a huge starting number , almost 1 in 11 public servants ... which i think points to huge problems in greek economy from the get go , there is also retirement at age 50 ( in some sectors i think , please correct me ! ), 
  which in this day and age is hugely expensive to the state and not sustainable , i mean he states they have done more than rajoy or post-berlusconi italy but of course they have , they had to there was absolutely no other way other than leaving the euro . 
  i would say in summation that while i do think that the greeks have reformed more than they are given credit for those reforms were undertaken from a very poor starting position ( and have already created a huge societal shock ) i think without devaluation and monetary controls ( or alternately a huge loan to allow the pace of reform to slow which is n't going to happen ) they will leave the euro . 
  very sad to see the decline of the bretony language , one of the strongest celtic tongues only 50 years ago . 
  i 'll tell you something about the punt , the fuckin ' weight of the things , they were so god damn heavy , going back to canadian money from irish was like playing with toys . 
  they also looked great and had a pretty consistent design from the 1930s to the adaption of the euro , so that was cool . 
  `` fuck the eu , you ca n't tell us what to do '' . 
  ironically a perfect time for the eu to give them a firm slap and tell them to behave . 
  it blew my mind being in ireland for summer holidays ( i grew up in canada before i moved back ) and seeing my cousins get the wooden spoon treatment , it was so oldschool like something from grim 's fairy tales . 
  i 'm from a country that has had high levels of emigration for literally centuries , and i can say that the minute the country gets itself back together economically and raising a family and being somewhat comfortable is possible then people will return and they will return the better for having the perspective and experience of working abroad , they will be some of your best citizens so i would n't worry too much about it . 
  there 's also an argument that detroit was very poorly designed from a city planning perspective that made it ill-suited for a post-industrial existence .
