  thats a pretty blanket statement , not all post-colonial states have fared the same and they have existed for a relatively short period of time often with [ heavy interference from former colonial masters ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nigerian_civil_war ) . 
  if you took a look at ireland in 1970 's ( ie . 
  50 years after independence ) we were n't exactly a resounding success : corrupt , theocratic , with terrorism fermented at home and huge amount of citizens emigrating , one of the poorest economies in europe and that 's without being the scene of many proxy conflicts between the soviet union and the u.s.a. 
  i would say its more than that , in paris there is a certain amount of reserve and perhaps jadedness ? 
  but generally nothing i would call rudeness , i think it comes down to an unwillingness to go out of the way to ingratiate themselves to outsiders ... example i can think of recently was going to a cafe and ordering breakfast ( in french with so-so accent ) and they were just like `` there 's no more bread ... '' end of conversation . 
  no apologies or any of the stuff that you would get in ireland or wherever , which is n't rude but perhaps just ... blunt ? 
  not much different from finland or holland but a shock if your from a more service-orientated country . 
  i also think much of the ` rudeness ' comes from the importance of etiquette ( proper greetings etc. ), 
  that seems very important to french culture . 
  has it changed much in relation to rent-seeking ? 
  for example i remember an article talking about truck drivers being a hugely protected profession with licences changing hands for big money ( very like taxi drivers in ireland at one time ) was that common ? 
  because i can see that being a nightmare for any independent industry or export orientated industry . 
  whenever i see something like that i ca n't help but hear the game of thrones theme tune in my head . 
  beautiful ( gothic ? ), 
  castle , most in ireland are square towers of blasted rock , not much for looks , but thats what happens when you have upwards of 130 kings and a population of 500,000 as we did . 
  trust me , it 's england , i do n't think scotland ran the show or the isle of man for that matter . 
  also all you supposed leftists who love russia because its not america , look at the way gay rights activists , civil society activists and journalists are treated in both countries and get your heads straight . 
  it 's false equivilency at its worst . 
  i understand that , i do n't fear or hate england because i know they have come to terms with ireland and other countries right to self determination , we had our own terrible war and not long before finlands . 
  the difference is a relationship with england is built on respect , mutual understanding and legal norms , russia doese n't give a fuck about those things , openly . 
  this is such bullshit , hear that spinning noise ? 
  its your ancestors who had to fight tooth & nail to keep your country independent and lost your home region in the meantime , just to have it fucked up by russia . 
  yeah i 'm curious about that too considering they were revealed to be as corrupt as the others all told . 
  there was also a great symbolic value , it was n't just something granted by judiciary through formula , it was a popular acceptance of the idea of gay marriage by the majority + , as many young gay men said `` i feel like i can hold my boyfriends hand in public '' it was very strong symbol of not just judicial vindication but public acceptance which i think is very important . 
  which is in a roundabout way returning to the paganism of the original festivals that the catholics stole from, 
  [ once catholic always a catholic !, 
  its in the blood . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2mvow3a7t8 ), 
  well done everyone !, 
  gutted i could n't be home for that one . 
  he 's not , he 's one of the best commentators on russian politics and life on this subreddit, 
  yeah i get that , people over mythologize it , it was not , but it was the golden age of american art , design and music in many ways and if you were the average middle class family it was the highpoint of your wages and standard of living . 
  yes the good old days ... for white , straight , male people !, 
  ( who are n't communists , or jews , or catholics or ... ), 
  cool cars , good tunes , great writers and good looking people , and rampant anti-communist witch hunts , but so much other great stuff !, 
  i see what they did there, 
  yeah generally volunteers these days are n't artists and writers and socialists but mercenaries and right-wing nut-jobs , like the guys who went to fight in ukraine from the west have some very unsavory views . 
  london is for sure , they get a huge amount of public spending and all the grand infrastructure projects . 
  i would say that though the older people lean no , there is far fewer of them than most european countries , ireland on the whole is quite young demographically so that 's helpful . 
  yeah irelands economy improved dramatically under fianna fail too but it creates a false trade off , we should demand that our politicians be both competent and uncorrupt , the other thing is eventually the corruption becomes a bigger part of the formula than the compentence . 
  i get it , for an rural ireland in the 1950 's building up infrastructure and handing out subsidies and favors was a very welcome thing and the first many of them would have seen in way of ` getting something ' from central power , but its created a lot of long term problems with accountability . 
  ireland got up to that for a long time !, 
  the old joke was `` they paved the roads !! '', 
  but basically the main party was pretty blatantly corrupt but largely economically competent ( or so we thought !!, 
  dun dun dun ) then 2008 rolls round and the whole thing goes to shit , but basically they were the party of government for 50 years . 
  true , he was opportunistic but if you see for example his refusal to sell out the poles to the russians as a way of avoiding that conflict he did see a moral right to determination ( which he understood being corsican ) , but regardless i think france & spain were of great help in maintaining irish links with europe and an independent irish identity and better to have fought in the brigades for that than for a country whose elites would have them starve to death a few decades later , as charles trevelyan , the man in charge of famine relief stated '' the famine was an `` effective mechanism for reducing surplus population '' as well as `` the judgement of god '' '', 
  that 's a supposition on your behalf , from napoleons personal notes you can see he did not want a war with england , he knew france needed to consolidate the new regime and had a weak navy . 
  thats exactly like irish people when i was in vancouver , we would spot them 300 yards out , the clothes , the manner , the walk , it was all there . 
  i think it was the false ` its only about economics argument ' independence is much more than book keeping , its a sense of connection and belonging , even in bad economic times if you asked people ` do you want to be back in the uk with a better economy ' there 's no way they would say yes , because that 's not what nationhood is . 
  i have no grudges , he was a great man , and he supported the irish during a rough patch , ( as well as the poles , etc. ), 
  nonsense , there was nothing approaching real suffrage in britain , it discriminated against religions and held a peerage system that had real political power , the differences were very distinct . 
  i 'd believe it !, 
  pay a visit sometime , its a nice place . 
  i dunno i 'm working my way through andrew roberts ` napoleon the great ' and around the time of the russian invasion he stopped taking real advice , the power was catching up with him , i know he had a spectacular run but i think things would have gotten worse . 
  oh i think more modern than britain socially , there was still penal laws discriminating against catholics , the death of hundreds and thousands of irish in the famine ( directly a result of british policies ) was a few years in the future . 
  the first army of england had gathered on the channel coast in 1798 , but an invasion of england was sidelined by napoleon 's concentration on campaigns in egypt and against austria , and ** shelved in 1802 by the peace of amiens ** / before the british declared war, 
  the napoleonic & revolutionary wars were separate conflicts , they had negotiated a peace ending them . 
  ** britain ** ended the uneasy truce created by the treaty of amiens when it declared war on france in may 1803 , in 1805 ** britain ** gathered together allies to form the third coalition against france , within months of the collapse of the third coalition , the fourth coalition ( 1806 -- 07 ) against france was formed by ** britain ** , prussia , russia , saxony , and sweden . 
  in july 1806 , napoleon formed the confederation of the rhine out of the many tiny german states which constituted the rhineland and most other western parts of germany.the fifth coalition ( 1809 ) of ** britain ** and austria against france formed as britain engaged in the peninsular war in spain and portugal . 
  well [ this seems appropriate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj_9cinkkn4 ) but seriously , napoleon was pretty reactionary/myopic but he was a hell of a lot better than 99 % of his enemies , and tried several times to make peace with the english in a war they began . 
  this idea that people have that he was some kind of proto-hitler is nonsense . 
  what is russia 's relationship with jews ? 
  like its obviously a big part of the culture and a lot of famous russians are jews and the israeli 's have a good relationship with russia but then i 've read that there is pretty widespread anti-semitism ? 
  well its not no apparent reason , the idea is to discourage dynastic wealth from having an unfair influence over politics/economy and encourage social mobility , wealth is a massive advantage and if a country professes to be a meritocracy of some sort then it needs relatively even playing fields . 
  what it does though is strengthen peoples connection to legistlation and the political process , without that parties can just turn around , do whatever major change even if it was n't in their manifesto , its just another accountability mechanism . 
  i can see what he 's saying small & medium buisness create the most jobs and keep money in the economy more than large ones , they also usually have a stronger local tie , so if an inheritance tax also taxes buisness assets and income thats a problem , they should shape it so that it applies to personal wealth ( admitting that its pretty hard to do that because suddenly ever wealthy person would have a company in which their wealth rested ... ), 
  cops jobs are to beat people for minor infractions ? 
  sure , its tense and the public can be a nightmare , but the fact is that even if that man did insult the police ( as was alleged ) they do n't have the right to beat him with a club , not in a democracy . 
  if they are offended and feel he 's belittled them they can fine him or arrest him ( which seems over the top ) but beating him and his elderly father is unacceptable . 
  you seem to be on this ` wake up sheeple ' thing with the corporate rant , but a ) disability director , is probably another name for their carer b ) i suggest you watch ` the punk syndrome ' a documentary about them , you 'll get a better sense of how this works c ) music producer in this case is literally a guy in small studio recording them live to tape , its not big money corporate media , they sell vinyl on a small label . 
  you point out that your not saying anything about there expression through art then you call them a circus act , invalidating their art by saying its a novelty without merit , which is both condescending & shitty . 
  well i will say again : what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  they came together as part of a non-profit music program for disabled people , they 've been a band for years , the guitarist is a big fan of the contest and wanted to enter and they are managed by one of their carers . 
  like i do n't know what your ranting about if you know nothing about them , but its pretty condescending that you also seem to think people with disabilities ( a range of them from williams syndrome to autism ) are without agency , incapable of expressing themselves or making their own choices . 
  what the fuck is this guy talking about ? 
  its a contest/popular vote , the producers have no say , and the band did n't even win the panel votes in finland , do we have eurovision truthers ? 
  i think almost every region has its specialities which are cheaper and generally better than mcdonalds : fish & chips in the uk & ireland , doner & currywurst in germany , panini in italy etc. 
  yes a bit of sense , i could not give two shits about this if i was a student . 
  one thing i will say is that her defence was one of the lamest things i 've ever read , she does herself no favors with it . 
  basically this is storm in a teacup stuff, 
  i hope finland has some great crime novelists to dramatize this , could be a hit, 
  i agree , populist is probably a better label than far right , their taxation ideas for example are pretty far left and their support is largely working class . 
  well that 's kind of exactly what i 'm saying , they are not skinhead/neo nazis , but they are to the right of center , and usually to the right of the centre-right . 
  the rest of what your saying is speculation , but yes they are certainly more popular now that previously , but that 's not just a recent thing , there was long term decline in major party membership from the 1980s onwards that has to do with globalization , demographics , economics etc. 
  well it 's semantics , they are not the bnp obviously but they are in the `` immigrants are bringing aids '' right of the tories section of the spectrum , so if you consider tories center right then the ukip are the far right ( which in some countries would be skinhead/neo nazis ' but in britain is fairly tame ), 
  its true , and the general feeling i get from people my age ( late 20 's ) and younger is that it 's very much in the past , a lot more quebecois live in different areas of canada now , and the catholic aspect is not really an issue either . 
  yeah its the guardian , but some elements of the finns are definately xenophobic-populist ( which is generally a far right stance ) that would put them in ukip territory so i can see the comparison , i know some other stances are leftist , but i would not at all consider them center left . 
  edit : wikipedia classifies them as follows = finnish nationalism [ 4 ] economic nationalism [ 5 ] social conservatism [ 6 ] right-wing populism [ 7 ] [ 8 ] euroscepticism [ 4 ] pretty right wing mix . 
  it became the global lingua franca on the back of u.s. hegemony more than british so i think that would remain the case . 
  i agree with this , the dissent is warrented and their needs to be a counterweight to the continental powers but lately british diplomacy has been garbage , they need to build a base of support in europe ( countries like poland , sweden , holland , finland that share stances on many things ) and not just demand shit and then disappear . 
  i grew up in bc and i would be very sad to see quebec go , the structure of canadian government is such that most provinces have a huge amount of autonomy within the country anyways , and on top of that quebec has it 's legal/political system so i think major demands are addressed , i do n't mind the bilingualism , it 's a sign of respect and accomodation to a large portion of the population and a historical one , i think it 's a sign of the strength of the country that we can offer it . 
  i think its dependent on the government , the tories have been pretty poor at making their case in eu parliment and among eu politicians , they see acting tough there as an easy way to shore domestic support but it hurts britains long term goals and reforms . 
  i also read that the foreign service is hurting for german & french speakers which is n't going to do them any favors . 
  the vote is important , if they stay the issue will be considered closed for a while , if they leave then they can test the thesis of the burden of the eu to prosperity and the rest can move forward . 
  if heritage is all you have , then it 's a sad state of affairs , there are bigger things to worry about and greece has other things beyond alexander to be proud of . 
  this whole ` scandal ' is horseshit stirred up by your extremely corrupt political class , i presume to distract people from the fact that they were screwing the country . 
  it 's a name , that 's it , most people do n't even know that alexander the great was from macedonia , and that historical region actually covers 6 different countries including macedonia in it 's entirety . 
  there are bigger things to worry about than the same old balkan nonsense about historical wrongs & rights . 
  it 's like german portland . 
  that 's a pretty hot look in the trendier parts of helsinki at the moment,
