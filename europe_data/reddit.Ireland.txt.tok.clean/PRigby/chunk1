it 's strong though if you go to a handful of the correct nights in dublin/limerick you 'll see it . 
  really loved rusagano family 's album https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whylacxwbna, 
  never happens to me , i live in the uk now and even their current currency has the name of my old currency ( pounds ) i still accidentally refer to prices * here * in euro . 
  i think the term ` quid ' helped irish people transition , we used it for pounds and we use it for euro too . 
  we tend to go to the gaeltachts ( irish speaking regions ) where we speak irish and there 's games and dances etc. 
  you do n't camp though , you stay with locals . 
  some things i remember reading were 1 . 
  the netherlands have great flooding defences but if the water gets past them once it 'll be hard to shove that back out . 
  spain will burn from the inside out 3 . 
  ireland and the uk will get stormier , the term cold hurricane was used those are my vague recollections, 
  do they complain ? 
  seems to be the fairest system that also gives local representatives . 
  nope being genuine , our system for electing tds ( members of our lower house ) and electing our president work really well . 
  edit : typos man , typos, 
  that 'd be `` head of government '' then, 
  nope , stv and instant run-offs are pretty great . 
  dup is very much the bogeyman of our politics , we 're glad they have no power here . 
  i really like the idea that i can live in any one of 31 countries ( 28 + norway , iceland , switzerland ) . 
  also the eu does n't have magical control over refugees or external immigrants, 
  pan-european content is probably more likely to flourish online , and to be honest shit like that is kinda starting to happen neo magazin royale produces some vids in english * [ v for varoufakis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afl9wfgje0m ) * [ be deutsch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmqkv5ctuoy ) * [ grab us by the pussy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzc8tbtidhi ) zondag met lubach in the netherlands does too * [ the netherlands welcomes trumps ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eld2awfn9nc ) [ and what the fuck france which is made by canal + ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc9pvaotz8vdlbrlhu5xaaoa ) i think netflix will also help break down borders in terms of content . 
   northern ireland ? 
  oh no man , i live in scotland :p, 
  the uk 's tories just keep getting more and more authoritarian , theresa may 's refusal to do any proper in person debates with corbyn was a disgusting enough subversion of democracy for me , but with all the cuts this party is notorious for making people forget they 've made cuts to police and security services . 
  there 's also been very little investment into british cyber security . 
  ugh , i need to leave this country , or the country i 'm in needs to leave the country it 's in . 
  so the big one is that each irish consonant has two pronunciations depending on whether it 's surround by a broad vowel ( a , o or u ) or by a slender vowel ( e or i ) so with your above example i dunno how to pronounce the d or t. the h in the above is a s\u00e9imhi\u00fa which only happens in certain grammatical situations ( ex . 
  m\u00e1dra = dog , mo mh\u00e1dra = my dog ) a noun in the pure nominative case ca n't have a s\u00e9imhi\u00fa . 
  also since the s\u00e9imhi\u00fa is n't really considered a letter ( it used to be written as a dot above the consonant ) ml does n't really happen in irish as a written phoneme . 
  sooooo you could do fl\u00e1idim\u00edr p\u00fata\u00edn , or vl\u00e1idim\u00edr p\u00fata\u00edn but the v will be grammatically treated like an f example : in the vocative case = a vhl\u00e1idim\u00edr !, 
  ( hey vladimir ! ), 
  the vh is treated the same as fh ( which is silent ), 
  that 's breaking so many rules of spelling, 
  yeah , tis where it comes from i think , in a `` they 're all called that '' kinda way, 
  why i oughta !, 
  * ( bring more polish bread and i 'll grab a 6 pack of karpackie and we sit by the canal , it 'll be great craic ) *, 
  that 's fair , what do you think of president bnaanmnp nytnh ? 
  what do you mean it 's vladimir putin ? 
  that does n't make any sense , i 'm right and your language is stupid !, 
  sadhbh and tadhg do , sive and taig . 
  people need to stop reading irish as english though , i have no idea why they think that 's somehow our fault . 
  yeah , i hate this stat because while it 's true to a certain extent there 's still no exclusively polish speaking towns or governmental services in polish . 
  you ca n't live there unless you are fluent in irish already , you can visit sure but not live . 
  also there 's no major economic centres in the gaeltachts so very little migration to begin with . 
   even though they remain in sweden ?? 
  no , what ? 
  i meant if you had kids in ireland , and they went through the irish education system . 
   i would probbaly learn som irish words , but it would depend on where in irleand i 'd live . 
  once you exclude the gaeltachts ( irish speaking regions ) the level of irish is the same , no city in the republic is more or less fluent in irish than another city . 
  you may encounter more native speakers in galway making a trip into the city to do some shopping but that 's about it, 
  we tend to be overjoyed when people not born in ireland make the effort to learn a couple of words , you by no means need to be fluent but again we 'd be overjoyed if you were . 
  keep in mind though that if you intend to spend the rest of your life there your kids would have to learn irish , it 's a mandatory subject in school so i 'd recommend learning some concepts to help them with their homework if you intend to raise a family in ireland . 
  and days later from the same publication https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/28/no-reason-to-doubt-no-irish-no-blacks-signs https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/25/no-irish-no-coloureds-notices-were-no-myth i think you 've fallen for some good old fashioned revisionism, 
   from the outside , i 'm not sure what has changed , but there 's a particular narrative that has developed as a result of the uk voting for brexit that assumes we all woke up raging xenophobes at some point last june . 
  i 'm sorry but the perspective from ireland is that the xenophobia has always been there . 
  `` no blacks , no dogs , no irish '' etc and that was the 80s in london , the press constantly attacking the polish from 2004 to 2007 when they switched gear to romanians and bulgarians , and yeah that 's the gutter press but they still have the widest circulation . 
  i live here now and yes there are lovely british people but there still those who constantly feel the need to `` correct '' my pronunciation and immigrants do hang out with other immigrants , why ca n't i make british friends is a common question . 
  also it 's striking the difference polish people 's visibility here with ireland , i 've yet to meet one , no mutual friends , none in work etc where 's in ireland every second person had a polish wife and husband . 
   ireland 's opting out from schengen to be fair , pretty sure we did that because of the uk ( more specifically ni ) if the uk joined schengen or we regained the north then it 's all fair game, 
  what ? 
  no-one speaks an caighde\u00e1n oifigi\u00fail , that 's kinda the problem with teaching it . 
  spree ( spraoi meaning fun ) and tory ( toraidhe meaning conman ), 
  neutrality , basically not being neutral or admitting that we are n't really neutral . 
  that stance is suicide for our politicians . 
  `` something something british isles '', 
  as an irish person living in the uk , this scone pronunciation thing is stupid to me . 
  we think the gone pronunciation is the posh one , because only british people say it . 
  i remember a beautiful quote from a german woman quoting her grandfather  my grandfather went to war with the french , got injured in battle received a medal and went home , my father went to war with the french , got injured in battle received a medal and went home and i went to war with the french , got injured in battle received a medal and went home . 
   the greatest honour in our family is that my children and grandchildren will never receive a medal . 
  massively paraphrasing but i teared up at that . 
   if you look at the polls you notice that support for independence did n't move since the last referendum took place . 
  that 's not quite true , the numbers stayed the same but 13 % of people changed there mind . 
  it 's not a rigid issue made of people unwilling to change their mind . 
  if you are a unionist in scotland the numbers staying the same , and people constantly voting for pro-indy parties is n't what i 'd call not concerning . 
  edit : also demographic shift, 
   the uk does not have one specific constitutional document . 
  instead the constitution is found within a variety of written and some ** unwritten ** sources . 
   no national constitution in europe allows the secession of an autonomous region what 's a constitution ? 
  ~ the united kingdom, 
  i take germany and poland and any country under them that is n't further south than italy . 
  so that 's germany , poland , czechia , slovakia , hungary , austria , switzerland and maybe slovenia . 
  that 's what i 'd say, 
  i 'm not sure you grasp how war-averse europe is in comparison to the us . 
  all but 1 country in the eu have been occupied or owned by another country , many of them within living memory . 
  and everybody in 2003 did not include france and germany . 
   if anything because there are more than 20 different languages they could speak . 
  the irish army is trained to take commands in irish regardless of their fluency . 
  india has 24 official languages and seems to manage fine . 
  i 'm not really gon na argue the validity of an eu army in the way op outlined but i 'm not convinced language would be an issue . 
  ** craic ** , or more accurately *** the * craic ** . 
  lifted from wikipedia - is a term for news , gossip , fun , entertainment , and enjoyable conversation . 
  also worth noting that people can be `` good craic '' or `` no craic '' which most irish people understand even if they ca n't quite put their finger on why . 
  the best explanation i 've heard is ` the willingness to have fun ' that someone who 's good craic knows it 's more fun to keep dancing when the dj plays a shite song than it is to sulk in the corner and think you 're above it all . 
  i 'm not sure many in ireland would view it the same as lagom , sisu or hygge but i do think it explains a lot of irish culture and attitudes . 
  again from the ol' wikipeida - [ information sciences professor eileen m. trauth called `` craic '' an intrinsic part of the culture of sociability that distinguished the irish workplace from those of other countries . 
  trauth wrote that even as ireland transitioned away from an economy and society dominated by agriculture , the traditional importance of atmosphere and the art of conversation -- `` craic '' -- remains , and that the social life is a fundamental part of workers ' judgment of quality of life . 
  it was kind of a pain , but as / u/mistermysterios correctly pointed out unanimity still exists for the most sensitive issues ( economic , foreign policy etc ) and the other votes are handled using the qualified majority system , which requires at least 55 % of the nations to agree and they must represent at least 65 % of the population of europe . 
  i think its a pretty fair system . 
  here 's a fun * calculator http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/voting-system/voting-calculator/ __ ^ ^ * my ^ ^ definition ^ ^ of ^ ^ fun ^ ^ at ^ ^ least, 
  most people have suggested introducing more parties or abolishing the electoral college in one way or another . 
  another solution i always found fascinating is getting rid of primaries .
