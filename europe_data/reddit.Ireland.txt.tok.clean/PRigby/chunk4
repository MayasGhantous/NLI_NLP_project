  't was five eyes , not six . 
  i really do n't think they will , want to or have the capability to spy . 
  more concerned about being spied on by foreign governments tbh . 
   do you trust that they are generally looking out for your best interests ? 
  i trust that they think they are , but i ideologically disagree with how they do it . 
  a lot of them have glaring self interest though like not doing much to lower the value of property because they all own property . 
  some people will be sarky about foreigners learning irish and i was once the same until i heard an 8 year old pakistani kid speak some decent irish and i nearly got on my knees , wept and started thinking of if only padraig pearse was alive today . 
  seriously though * the concept of slender & broad vowels and slender & broad consonants is everything in irish , if you ca n't pronounce the difference between a broad r and a slender r things are gon na get difficult . 
  * we do tapped r 's , like the japanese . 
  that 's a broad r. slender r is an impossible to describe sound . 
  * do n't bother with gender , most of us do n't . 
  foreign investment , we export things people need regardless of how poor/rich they are ( food , medicine , medical equipment ) and we are tied to the uk and usa economically more so than the rest of europe . 
  if those countries do well , we do so as well . 
  edit : oh and we do n't have the ageing population issue that a lot of europe has , population growth is often tied to economic growth so i 'm sure that 's helping some what . 
  i would need to do research , but maybe renzi ? 
  if stubb was still in charge in finland , him . 
  he seemed good, 
  i would n't vote enda kenny, 
  bogus asylum claims are rejected and are sent back , there were reports that the eu was gon na fund a new terminal in kabul national airport purely to handle all rejected afghan asylum claims . 
  people from outside syria can have genuine asylum claims , the eu received a relatively high number of asylum seekers even before the migrant crisis , they just were n't newsworthy . 
  either way the numbers still have n't reached a level from outside of syria that when combined with the syrian asylum seekers make that 4 % ( 22.5 million ) . 
  still my larger point stands , certain politicians are going to use this crisis and ride a wave of fear and uncertainty to push through laws unconnected to the migrant crisis . 
  i think the largest issue is the attempted or successful political co-opting of the situation . 
  even if all of syria were in europe tomorrow that would only be a 4 % population increase and that 's never gon na happen but some politicians are making it seem like it will and are using this myth to push unrelated agendas , like leaving the eu . 
  i 'm paying attention to both and i 'm super interested . 
  i do n't want hofer to win in austria and i want yes to win in the referendum . 
  i 'm worried about how right europe is swinging in general and a far-right candidate taking office in austria and a socialist government getting defeated in the ( now ) third largest eu country would be a concerning string of events . 
   english will be replaced by spainish as the offcial language of the eu , and will serve to compete with english as the world 's dominant language . 
  naaaaaah , chances are english will remain as a strong working language . 
  it 's the most common language amongst eu citizens as shown by / r/europe / r/askeurope, 
   ireland i think we 're actually one of the most pro-eu countries , we have issues with military integration is all . 
  yeah , it does come from a plastic paddy thing . 
  mc ( found in last names ) is pronounced m * a * c with an unstressed * a * , mckenna , mcdonagh , mccormack etc etc. 
  mick is very american and you 'd be corrected for pronouncing last names that way here . 
  it 's a contraction of mac , the irish for son . 
  yes-ish , the definition is vague but op is correct in saying that we are uncomfortable with * bloodline * nationalism, 
  4 years !? 
  that does n't seem very metric ... 
  i do it for every english person i encounter who thinks ireland is a different country like wales is . 
  * in french-speaking belgium * ** local : ** where are you from ? 
  ** me : ** i 'm from ireland ** local : ** oh holland !, 
  * non-stop dutch speaking begins * ** me : ** * ( eventually ) * no no , * eeeer * - lawnd, 
   something about how my country raped and pillaged its way around the world and i should feel bad ... well i mean, 
  we do discuss but most people acknowledge a series of events is required ( basically shit brexit time + scottish independence might do it ) i 'd say our current circlejerk is more `` the brits are falling apart , this is slightly more funny than terrifying '', 
  less likely , but american goods/companies would be hard to avoid, 
  well a lot of centre-right parties in europe are pro-european , like the pp in spain , cdu in germany , fg in ireland etc etc. 
  far-right not so much . 
  these are parties that want to return the * `` glory days '' * of the nation state , where we all had are own currency , you could say what you wanted about women and you could just take the rhineland . 
  like others have said it 's rose-tinted glasses and they typically attract an older vote . 
  there 's also a fair amount of accusations of funding from the kremlin . 
   liberals love to call southerners who wave confederate flags traitors , yet they are unironically talking about secession . 
  that 's not why people have a problem with the confederate flag . 
   i 'd see it more probable in a eu-like organisation rather than ussr-like . 
  you mean the eurasian union ? 
  it 's not taught , benefit of being in one of the most western parts of europe , we are far away from the fuzziness of the `` border '' i am reminded of a fun quote , `` europe is an asian-subcontinent with a superiority complex '', 
  i think you are getting too specific with the comparison , as grumpy badgers has pointed out the real comparison is the 2008 economic crisis with the 1929 stock market crash resulting in slow growth manifesting as a refusal of social and liberal progress . 
  it 's troubling and history does repeat itself but not so exactly, 
  never heard of montessori until i moved to dublin , in cork , limerick and galway we called it playschool . 
  i did hear it once in geordie shore and was very suprised, 
  i live in scotland now , i know people who know the term and people who do n't ( mainly from se england ) but have n't heard anyone actually use the term . 
  craic , which i think is actually from middle english/scots but was adopted into irish and has been adopted back into hiberno-english . 
  not sure if that counts . 
   craic is a term for news , gossip , fun , entertainment , and enjoyable conversation , particularly prominent in ireland . 
  it is often used with the definite article -- the craic -- as in the expression `` what 's the craic ? '', 
  ( meaning `` how are you ? '', 
  or `` what 's happening ? 
  i 've actually read up on this and talked to some italian friends about it . 
  i back this reform , after looking into it i 'm not sure perfectly symmetric bicameralism works too well , it seems bloated . 
  i also heard that senators might come from regional mayors now as well but i 'm not sure if that is true , giving the senate a clear purpose distinct from that of parliament is important . 
  i am upset that it has become politicised and i hope it does n't end up just being a vote on how much people like renzi , it seems like a decent reform . 
   `` are you coming ? '', 
  - `` i am coming '' or `` i am not coming '' . 
  if this sounds clunky to anyone , it 's worth noting it 's usually just compounded to one word answers `` an dtagair ? '', 
  as a european english speaker i say `` 16th of august '' or `` 3rd of march '' etc etc etc, 
  the isle of man is one i think about a fair bit , it 's a crown dependancy like guernsey but like my motherland and the country i live in now , scotland ( we need double flairs amirite ? ), 
  it has goidelic heritage . 
  i 've been there and it 's beautiful and fascinating but what i think about is what the isle of man would do in the scenario of scottish independence and/or irish reunification . 
  it would be interesting how the isle of man would react but i suspect it would n't be widely reported on . 
  i mean , it 's not like we invented it or anything, 
   which begs the question : is there any monarchic country organized as a federation ? 
  yup , canada , australia , united arab emirates and malaysia . 
   i do n't think you could transform autonomous regions into federal states without changing their borders oooo could you expand on that ? 
  i love this image, 
   well , im not entirely sure if i understand what are you asking but here is my try i guess i 'm asking if the people who propose federation are people with any actual power or is just some people/special interests groups that reckon its a good idea thanks for your answer , tis very interesting, 
  i agree , i live in scotland now , there does seem to be a celtic form of politics, 
  ah yeah , that 's a big one, 
  i suspect this is largely due to the british being perceived as right-wing , conservative and corporatist and irish nationalism presented itself as the opposite . 
  i really would n't recommend holding a weapon if you 're having a good st. patrick 's day . 
  hmmm i 'd guess : * ireland does n't really have a left v right opposition our classical ruling/opposition relationship is based around the civil war * our nationalists are far-left , not far-right which makes them fairly different from how other nationalists operate * civic nationalism . 
  tbf some irish people do n't get this one . 
  in irish we use girl/boy `` mo chail\u00edn '' = my girl ( girlfriend ) and `` mo bhuachaill '' = my boy ( boyfriend ) , we use these regardless of age , it only becomes my woman/man when you get married ( we do n't have a word for husband/wife ) , you can add ch\u00e9ile at the end of any of these to be super clear . 
  stumpa and mot are both used in irish nowadays as slang for girlfriend , stumpa is similar to ` shorty ' in english and is literally a word for tree stump . 
  mot is hiberno-english slang for girlfriend that has worked it 's way into irish even though it comes from the irish word for good `` maith . '', 
  dublin was basically an english city , twas founded by the vikings and used by the british to control ireland . 
  i live in the uk now and when people ask about visiting i recommend galway , it 's a very * irish * city , a bit more celtic and a bit further from the historical influence of the uk . 
   japan is doing just fine nah they 're in recession and have a labour shortage and chronic ageing population . 
  edit : i do think japan would benefit by an eu like union with south korea , taiwan and asean countries ( basically everyone around them that is n't russia/china )  and india and china were much larger powers on the world stage just few centuries ago and that in no way threatened the `` small powers '' of europe . 
  i think you 're referring to what europe called the dark ages ? 
  after which britain industrialised and destroyed china with opium . 
  edit : they also conquered india .
