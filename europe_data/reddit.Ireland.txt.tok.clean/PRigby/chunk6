  i miss it so much, 
  the stereotype in ireland is [ limerick city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/limerick ) and i used to live there and story that i always use to explain limerick to people outside of limerick . 
  the mayor of limerick complained about the city 's reputation , `` why is it called stab city ? 
  it should be called fab city for how fabulous it is '' to which a local newspaper ran with the story the next morning `` man fabbed outside of pub '' . 
  as someone who actually lived there it 's fine, 
  yes . 
  the eu has criteria , if those criteria are met then sure but that would be politically a very different turkey , i really do n't care about the geography or culture . 
  really though i think the stalled membership is a means for both turkey and the eu to influence each other and maintain diplomatic ties , kind of like some odd version of an alliance . 
  i 'm not entirely convinced turkey is aiming for membership or that the eu expects it anytime within the next 20-50 years . 
  thinking being smashed is the best time to talk about religion , this is the true universal language . 
  you are absolutely right correcting now, 
   i 've heard christianity is a very widespread religion in ireland , and that you 're pretty strict about it oooo , this would have been my fifth point . 
  ireland 's relationship with religion is complicated and certainly deviates slightly from the standard secularism of europe . 
  ireland would n't identify as christian but rather catholic and distinctly not protestant , there are historical and political reasons for the distinction that permeates the irish zeitgeist . 
  we are a rapidly changing nation , so while your statement might 've been true of the early 90s it is not now . 
  we legalised same sex marriage in 2015 by popular vote but homosexuality was illegal up until 1993 , this is a ridiculously quick turn around for any country . 
  there 's the stark contrast between our ~ ~ first ~ ~ third president \u00c9amon de valera bowing to the pope and our current taoiseach ( prime minister ) telling the church to butt out of the referendum on same sex marriage . 
  worth noting that italy and germany still do n't have same sex marriage . 
  also church attendance keeps plummeting 3 . 
  that being said the ghost of our more religious past still lingers , search twitter for #repealthe 8th for our countries heated abortion debate and divorces in ireland are still lengthy legal procedures . 
  these laws often do n't reflect the will of modern ireland , rather than the will of ireland 5-10 years ago . 
  ~ 80 % of ireland is catholic but our second biggest faith is atheism at ~ 10 % and 10 % of catholics in ireland also say they do n't believe in god . 
  this is often referred to as the cultural catholic , someone who identifies with catholic morality and customs but not the more fantastical and mythological aspects of the religion . 
  our constitution mentions catholicism a butt load but we have fundamental rights that guarantee freedom of religion and a blasphemy law , that was made toothless by a court ruling but still extends to all religions in ireland not just catholicism 6 . 
  i 'd recommend watching the irish sitcom [ father ted ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zkl91lzcmc ) to many of us it captures perfectly the irish attitude to religion , it permeates our society and culture but ultimately it 's something to be parodied , mocked and not taken seriously . 
  sorry for the essay answer but like i said ireland 's relationship with religion is complicated . 
  on a european scale i would say we are typically secular and i 'd say we sit somewhere between the netherlands , france and poland , italy on the secularism in society scale . 
  edit : forgot my order of presidents , \u00c9amon de valera sure did a lot, 
  pretty much every party in ireland came from pre-civil war sinn f\u00e9in . 
  original sinn f\u00e9in and modern sinn f\u00e9in are very different parties , the sinn f\u00e9in that operates in the republic even acts differently to the sinn f\u00e9in that operates in the north . 
  not to mention that fianna f\u00e1il and fine gael are more successors to the sides of the civil war . 
  / u/lgf92 is right i do distinguish between the two , they are very different , membership completely changed both after the war of independence , the civil war and all the years in-between and following and all the splits . 
  first irish . . deadly !, 
  silly , stupid and unnecessary , that would be the view of the ` ra . 
  we joke often about them and play up the idea of all irishmen as blindly supporting them as a caricature ( [ required watching ] ( https://youtu.be/vstdov0c1do?t=3m9s ) ) but the reality is next to no one supports them here , most irish people support irish unification but through diplomatic and democratic means . 
  a lot of them money launder and traffic drugs in spain nowadays so you can understand why we see them as a joke . 
  also the ira has nothing to do with irish independence , just thought i should say that , a lot of people would be offended by that implication . 
  * we all have red hair , brown hair is the most common here ( like the world at large i guess ) * we 're all drunks , pretty sure a handful of european nations drink more than us and i know a couple of non-alcoholics . 
  * we 're agrarian simple folk , our biggest export is medical technology and pharmaceuticals * we all wear green seriously had a weird experience where an american teenager was super excited to show me the internet and was surprised that my girlfriend at the time had braces . 
  if someone had lived that long in ireland non-stop i would consider them irish . 
  i have n't lived in ireland that long . 
   you should n't wonder why the rest of europe hates you we do ? 
  must have missed the memo, 
  i went to 6 different schools in ireland ( my family moved a lot ) 4 primary schools and 2 secondary schools , 2 of those private and 4 of them public . 
  ireland 's education system is good , there 's improvements to be had i 'm sure but after living in the uk for a while i see that i got a consistent and useful education , even cspe which is a subject we often slag is something i 'm glad i did , i think transition year is also a wonderful idea retrospectively . 
  the elephant in the room is of course the irish language , we spend every year of mandatory education learning yet the fluency rate is fucking god awful , it 's rising but really slowly and only very recently . 
  there is plenty of frustration among irish people about the state of the language but yeah ~ 14 years of language learning should leave you fluent , you should be fluent after 7 years so you can understand why we are confused and frustrated . 
  the only official languages are irish and english , but ulster scots and shelta are both native languages , but neither are widely spoken . 
  i 've never encountered ulster scots in the republic and only heard two people speak shelta, 
  yeah , i think he 's making the point that if not being in your home country , and not paying taxes in your home country for a certain period of time is grounds enough to lose a vote , then why is the opposite not enough to gain a vote in your country of resident . 
  seems like a very literal interpretation of ` no taxation without representation ', 
  i did n't say it was proof of being an eu citizen . 
  the nin gets you access to the nhs . 
  it is what the uk uses for a lot of its services reserved to residents because to get it you have to have proof that you have the right to be in the country, 
  that 's pretty much how i envisioned it , but a lot better written . 
  reciprocal agreements is key , i can see this happening in some way or another through the eu . 
  probably the way others have outlined it , with a number of years residency required first . 
   i can maybe understand that irish citizens get a vote , but all commonwealth citizens ... why ? 
  well if you are in the commonwealth the queen is the head of state , while ireland has a president . 
  they are more politically linked to the uk than ireland is , ireland only has some very minor power sharing allowances with northern ireland that slightly links the two countries but all ni citizens can instantly get an irish passport . 
  hmm that is an interesting idea, 
  the uk is an interesting case where this already kinda happens , irish citizens can vote at every level and commonwealth citizens can vote in most things . 
  yet i do n't think anything is happening in the uk that is n't the will of the british people other than politicians in the uk are n't shit to irish and commonwealth citizens . 
  yeah , i was talking all other and arguably more important elections . 
  that 's fair and it 's not the greatest solution i admit but the other side of the argument is that democracy should not be blaming those who ca n't vote . 
  i guess you would have to prove that you are considered a resident of that country + an eu citizen . 
  in the uk that would be when you have a national insurance number , in germany ( as i understand it ) you have to register with the local government and basically declare your presence after which point you could register to vote . 
  most ( if not all countries ) have means of telling whether you are an eu citizen whose a resident and an eu citizen whose passing through . 
  i 'm running ads for my eu politics podcast on reddit at the moment and do seem to be getting better responses from european subs than american subs ( some of the responses are even a little nasty ) that being said 27 % of listeners are from the states making it the second highest country of listening origin so you know ... shrug, 
  ireland the guard : buddy cop film about a corrupt and highly inappropriate garda from rural galway working with an american fbi agent to stop a drug shipment . 
  the film is a hilarious and dark in its humour . 
  trailer : https://youtu.be/ygva2w2qrac song of the sea : beautiful animated film that incorporates a handful of irish mythology . 
  a sweet plot , some good family friendly wit and robbed of an oscar by the uninspired big hero 6 . 
  trailer : https://youtu.be/vrhoozw8of8 grabbers : a small island town is being terrorized by carnivorous water dwelling aliens , and a handful of garda and people figure out that alcohol is poisonous to the aliens . 
  so in an effort to keep the calm , get the people off the island , and defend against the aliens they get drunk and get the entire town drunk . 
  very similar to other horror/action/comedies except everyone is smashed . 
  trailer : https://youtu.be/2tumuqxhbnu, 
  i 'm not op but he could be from the north , which i 'll let him field this question if he is . 
  however in the republic we do have some tribal politics since our two major political parties our basically descended from the two sides of the civil war in ireland . 
  you often vote for one of them because your family did and always did , even though the question that caused the civil war is long resolved and that the two parties have incredibly similar policies . 
   thanks . 
  these micks can bust . 
  except the rubberbandits . 
  but i bet they put on the best show . 
  ah yeah they 're comedians first [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=curakgat0rq ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7sm0a3llli ) , [ 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc98fap1v60 )  kind of reminds me of odd future . 
  yeah he 's been compared to earl sweatshirt before , do check out the other tunes in the pitchfork article and the full rusagano album online, 
  [ ah yeah the rubberbandits are class ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzo4rzxf3x4 ) , they actually do a lot for the scene , one of them directed the rusagano family video i posted above . 
  also while we 're on the jokier side of things [ this one goes out for all the boys on the f\u00e1s course , all the boys on the dole ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvljav8brzw ), 
   basically i 'm only familiar with scroobius pip and dizzy rascal yup and they are both pretty old , dls vs sp have been around since 2007 ( with [ thou shall always kill ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yon6xfyqsr4 ) being the first thing most people heard from them ) and bonkers by dizzee rascal , his biggest hit , was released in 2009 . 
  there is loads in british rap to be found and enjoyed , they have a healthy scene and you might wan na google *** grime *** a sub-genre that 's british born and bred . 
  the issue with rap though is that a lot of it in europe will not be in english and rap is a venue for the disenfranchised so a lot of it has to come with a decent cultural understanding of who that country 's disenfranchised is and why they are that way . 
  *** that being said *** here is some irish stuff . 
  [ reijie snow ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-3q0e-zrsg ) would be one of our best known internationally and many think he 's not irish due to how often he plays the states and england but fuck them right . 
  [ lethal dialect ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uirmw7iomn8 ) is where we get into the very irish stuff and less accessible internationally , he has a thick dub accent and discusses poverty , gentrification and a sense of hopelessness for his generation in ireland . 
  [ rusagano family ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whylacxwbna ) is some newer shit and their album let the dead bury the dead is quality , they are two african-born irish rappers living in limerick and a lot of their songs talk about life as an immigrant in rural ireland and challenging what it means to be irish . 
  [ here is a good article by pitchfork that discusses more of our rap scene ] ( http://pitchfork.com/features/article/9853-from-the-outside-in-meet-the-african-immigrants-who-are-legitimizing-irelands-hip-hop-scene/ ) / essay, 
   the general population thinks it will continue until putin dies , either by natural causes or overthrow , so it could be anywhere from now till 20 years later . 
  that 's grim but you are probably right . 
  he has a good 20-30 years left in him though . 
  i ca n't imagine him being overthrown he seems to have a tight grip on the country .
