  it 's also worth noting that the eu tends not to legislate on things that single out one member state , they legislate on eu-wide stuff and that member states do n't often think with one mind and this is where the parliament comes in . 
  british people do n't all agree with one another because they are british and the same goes for all other countries , so there is very little evidence that meps vote on national lines , they vote on the issues based on their political leanings regardless of country . 
  a socialist from germany is more likely to agree with a socialist from the uk than they are with a right-wing nationalist from germany . 
  so basically france and germany ca n't bully the uk into doing anything because none of those three countries can present a united front . 
   the remain campaign are talking about is the human rights bill which supposedly the tories would scrap if we leave . 
  to me , that seems like scaremongering . 
  sadly [ the british bill of rights was a thing the tories promised in the last two general election . 
  ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/proposed_british_bill_of_rights#/differences_from_the_human_rights_act ) what would be on that bill and how it differs from the eu/un accepted bill of rights has not been specified which is worrying to many people . 
  it begs the question `` what do the conservatives think needs changing with the existing bill of rights ? '', 
  and since you have no constitution they can change pretty whenever they want . 
  you also do n't have a high court that can legislate based on precedent , and they also do n't have a constitution to check new laws against . 
  you would then have to rely on the media to be angry before you 'd see anyone take notice and also get angry . 
  you 've admitted yourself , there is an issue of people not voting . 
  [ then you have the issues of the uk 's voting system . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9rgx91rq5i ) and unless you can convince scotland that snp are rubbish and labour are great again , which based on current attitudes would be very hard to do , you 're probably looking at a conservative government for the foreseeable future . 
  the eu means that all countries must adhere to the international human rights act . 
  it is the only thing in the uk 's government that acts as a check/balance since the uk has very little in the way of a checks and balance system that most other western democracies have . 
   as far as i can see , if our government does something that we do not like , then they will be voted out at the next election - or even worse a vote of no confidence is petitioned and the government is kicked out . 
  [ ... ] with the eu , i can not see an equivalent power . 
  you can vote differently in the european elections , if the minister you sent did something you did n't like you vote different in the next uk general election . 
  you can write to your mep . 
  the eu parliament can also do a vote of no confidence like it did in 1998 . 
   additionally , there is the problem with immigration is there ? 
  half of the immigration that comes in is from non-eu countries and eu countries produce more immigrants that have jobs lined up before they arrive . 
  the uk has control over all non-eu immigration and could half the immigration in take tomorrow without leaving the eu , but it does n't because it actually does n't cause issues . 
  immigrants help economies grow faster and create jobs , the more people here the more jobs are needed to accommodate them . 
  also if your worried about eu immigrants on benefits , the uk can deport all eu immigrants who are not self-sufficient . 
  just turns out very few eu immigrants are on benefits . 
  i 'd really recommend reading everything on https://fullfact.org a non-profit independent fact checking service . 
   i ca n't see how decisions in brussels can be affected by my vote , i prefer for decisions regarding the uk to be made in the uk . 
  you have n't voted in an eu election yet * and * general elections in the uk ( and every country ) effect how the eu is run . 
  the member states still hold the most power . 
  if you are interested in my arguments for remain : 1 . 
  leaving the eu will cause a recession , the # is already dropping at the prospect of a leave vote and all international financial institutions and the bank of england have come out in favour of remain for this reason . 
  since the last recession was only 8 years ago and since i entered the labour market at that point , i 'd really rather not go through another one . 
  i do n't think leave will give the amount of control leave campaigns are promising . 
  the uk would be the comparatively small nation beside an absolute behemoth of an economy that it relies on ( all nations rely on their neighbours ) you 'd either just agree with everything the eu did because you signed a treaty saying you would , or you 'd agree just so you can sell to them . 
  all allies have come out in favour of remaining , canada , the us , australia , new zealand , china , and india ( and of course all other eu nations , are closest allies ) i 'm not sure about the idea of ` entering the wider world ' when the wider world has said they 'd like us to stay . 
  northern ireland would need a hard border , this will cause tension and cripple the northern irish economy more than it already has been by the 2008 recession . 
  there is probably a sizeable amount of the population of british people in the uk right now planning to move to continent . 
  there has already been ( and still is ) a rush on irish passports , predicted to rise after a brexit . 
  maybe they have better work opportunities there in their industry , maybe they want a different lifestyle and maybe they are only a few years away from retiring to spain/south of italy/greece/wherever . 
  i see little benefit to telling them that their current life plans are now worthless . 
  while eu immigrants already in the uk will probably not be deported and as an irishman i 'm not affected by any of this , why would we stay when a society gave a massive democratic mandate to a group of politicians who spent the last 6 months campaigning about how we are a drain on society and a menace . 
  our workers rights would also be called into question because those are guaranteed by the eu as well . 
  do our spouses have to earn over # 30k a year to stay like all other migrants ? 
  if we go back to our home countries for prolonged periods of time ( lets say due to a family emergency ) are we guaranteed re entry ? 
  why would we put up with any of this when berlin , amsterdam , paris , copenhagen , stockholm are all ~ 30 mins away by plane and more welcoming . 
  even with all of this , eu immigrants already in the uk will *** probably *** not be deported , it would depend on everything that happens afterwards . 
  but yeah , sorry for the wall of text . 
  i think in this metaphor autobahns are like shooting ranges , it 's okay here ** but no where else **, 
  i 've always found the rule of seven quite handy as it accounts for how older couples can get away with larger age gaps . 
  ( your age / 2 ) + 7 = the youngest person you can date before i would consider it creepy . 
  by that formula a 24 year old can date a 19 year old and a 46 year old can date a 30 year old . 
  i also feel like milestones in life are important , i do n't think i could date someone now who is still in school or college because i 've been out working for 3-4 years and i do n't think we could relate with one another . 
  i would consider it creepy for a 26 year old to date an 18 year old , but your relationship does n't exist to please me so you know , as long as ye 're happy . 
  i would n't listen to speeches either , boris just wants to be pm and this is the only this can happen . 
  try fullfact.org and check the claims that both campaigns have made . 
  also find out how much funding your uni receives from eu reasearch grants, 
  no probs , any time , i live in the uk now and in my opinion this referendum has been god-awful . 
  ignore the press and do your own research ( like you are doing now i guess ) . 
  a good rule of thumb when it comes to the eu , if it 's not kinda boring it 's probably not true . 
  from i comment i made recently that did quite well on how the eu institutions work :  ** the commission ** has 28 members appointed by the governments of the eu ( one per country ) and approved by the parliament . 
  the president of the commission is put forward by the party that gets the most seats in the parliament ( like a pm ) . 
  they can write laws . 
   ** the parliament ** is directly elected by the people of europe and they fall into national parties as well as larger pan-european parties . 
  the parliament is ruled by a centrist grand coalition at the mo , made by the epp , s&d and alde . 
  they pass laws or block them demanding amendments . 
   ** the council of ministers ** has 28 seats and a president . 
  one seat per country . 
  they are filled by the relevant minister from the 28 democratically elected governments of the eu , relevance determined by the law being discussed , ie : if it 's to do with sanctions , each country will send their foreign minister , if it 's to do with the economy , each country sends their finance minister etc. 
  every so often the heads of government meet as well to advise and set an overall eu agenda . 
  the council can also pass and block laws demanding amendments . 
  they vote under two systems depending on the law , most of the time you need a unanimous vote or they 'll use the qmv system ( a kinda supermajority ) where min . 
  16 countries representing at least 55 % of the eu pop are needed to pass the vote . 
   for a law made by the commission to pass it needs approval from both the council and the parliament . 
   an eu-wide vote happens every five years , this effects both the commission and parliament . 
  the council of ministers is only effected by general elections in the 28 member states . 
   i think it 's democratic , it 's very similar in how a typical european parliamentry system works . 
  the only issue with eu democracy imho is participation . 
  there are eu votes , eu news and stories that can only be discussed when properly informed about how it all works and what powers the eu has but that does n't exist , but this is n't the eu 's fault really , i 'd blame the media and politicians that use the eu as a scapegoat and otherwise do n't talk positively about it or it 's potential . 
   he talks about `` government by proxy '' and how the eu are in control of some of the uk 's laws . 
  i do n't want to vote without knowing all opinions for and against but i ca n't see an argument against what he says yeah , i have seen similar arguments before . 
  the first thing to know is that the eu is not separate from the uk , the uk is a part of the eu in how it runs , it 's not the simple us vs them argument that caine and others have presented . 
  the uk is a sizeable chunk of the eu population and the eu 's parliament . 
  most council votes still require a unanimous decision so nothing really gets done in the eu without the uk 's permission . 
  a british commissioner is also involved in the law-making process . 
  as for the faceless bureaucrats , the more i hear people saying this the more it seems like a distinctly british media problem . 
  in ireland eu stories can make the front page and they mention clearly all involved , romania seems to have very healthy discussions of the eu summits , who 's involved and their positions and spain dedicate a good portion of their evening news broadcast to eu events . 
  there are plenty of brussels centric news publications , online and in english https://euobserver.com/ http://www.politico.eu/ http://www.euractiv.com/ euronews also does a good job of covering events in the eu . 
  there are good resource websites where you can check in on all eu `` faceless bureaucrats '' like http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/council-eu/index_en.htm and http://www.votewatch.eu/ . 
  if you do n't know who your meps are , if you do n't know who the uk 's commissioner is ( lord jonathan hill ) , when the next elections are , who won the last elections , if you did n't see the debates then you should be angry and rightfully so , but the eu would really like you to know and they are n't trying to keep this stuff away from you . 
  edit : forgot a word, 
  everything is bigger in america, 
  there were fears they would swallow them whole, 
  this , it 's also worth noting that similar eu economies ( germany and france ) run mandatory insurance systems rather than socialised systems . 
  they pay a mandatory government regulated insurance ( which to the end-user is * basically * a tax ) and pay small fees for visits and medicine ( these fees are capped and kept low ) . 
  even with all this extra money flowing through these systems germany and france still pay 2-3 % more of their total gdp towards their health systems than the uk does for it 's `` free at point of use '' system . 
  if you want the nhs to work better you have to sink way more money into it . 
  as a uk resident i think it 'd be worth it .
