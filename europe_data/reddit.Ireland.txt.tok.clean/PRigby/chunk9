  yeah ... you just described northern ireland and the ulster scots . 
  yeah for like most of the last century they were considered to be in the ` european half of the ussr ' along with georgia and armenia . 
  chechnya and dagestan would probably be considered asian if they were independent countries . 
  in that region the whole idea of what is asia and what is europe starts to get blurry . 
  as an individual , i do n't mind and i would crack out the popcorn for watching a traditionally isolationist and xenophobic political class deal with the freedom of movement . 
  but there would be no benefit to this , eu members are n't eu members for poops and giggles , countries are usually pretty dependent on their neighbours to function well and be prosperous , for this reason the eu expands radially because the eu makes that neighbour relationship easier and more prosperous for all involved . 
  i do n't think we view them as different , it 's the same as the american limit to free speech `` do n't shout ` fire ' in a crowded theatre '' is just shouting `` fire '' in a crowded theatre is a quicker way to violence than shouting `` all romanians are monsters . '', 
  both still lead to violence . 
  always be careful of the term `` superstate '' , it 's not actually a political thing , it 's just something thatcher said once that entered the british political zeitgeist . 
  anyway i like european integration but i do n't think it 's a thing that the eu forces on people , i think it 's something that happens naturally when we remove borders for largely economic and trade reasons . 
  i have a swedish wife and bulgarian , german and french friends , i did n't seek them out but for comparison my parents did n't have any non-irish friends until very recently ( when my sister married a spaniard and they got on a storm with his parents ) . 
  there was nothing that forced my siblings or i to look abroad for opportunities or friends/partners , i have plenty of irish born and raised friends who live very local lives but there is a marked difference between me and my parents generation . 
  the world that my parents describe ( the past ) just sounds so small to me . 
  i also want more catering for different eu communities in other countries , after my holiday in croatia ( a country that my parents could never dream of going to when they were younger btw ) i just wished ireland had more late night bakery/pastry places ( pekarnicas i think they were called ) that we could go to after a night out or go to the morning after . 
  when you are sloppy drunk , a apricot marmalade croissant goes down a treat . 
  also more european countries need to know the simple joys of an irish chicken fillet roll . 
  eh , kinda depends . 
  if you mean eastern/western ** world ** then poland is western , western world ( the west ) is defined by having a majority of it 's ethnicity coming from europe ( either directly or historically ) . 
  it 's mostly a poltical or cultural term rather than actually geographical . 
  if you mean eastern or western ** europe ** then i 'd say eastern europe , with a capital e. just a shorthand way of saying every country that made up the ussr plus the warsaw pact nations . 
  i 'm one of those pedantic people who will insist that ex-yugoslav nations are not eastern europe . 
  however geographically , i 'd say central . 
  technically greece does n't have sanctions against russia , the eu does ( which includes greece ) why ? 
  because russia * annexed * a portion of a country that rejected their pro-russian establishment in favour of a westward facing pro-eu one . 
  the turkish invasion of cyprus happened before greece or cyprus entered the eu and * technically * turkey does n't occupy northern cyprus they 're just the only country that recognises the trnc . 
  cyprus and greece do have frosty relationships with turkey because of it but sanctions would probably hurt any reunification process ( which i believe in the grand scheme of things is going quite well ) . 
  the trnc was embargoed by the eu up until 2004 and were only lifted because it was seen as a necessary step towards helping reunification happen . 
  really ? 
  i thought it was similar to here in ireland . 
  we start at 12/13 and do it for 6 years , usually french/german/spanish and you 'll probably get a class trip to the native land or the embassy in dublin . 
  you need to pass your exam in another european language to go to most colleges in ireland . 
  we also do irish from the moment we start school as well . 
  3 years is not enough time to learn a language as a teenager . 
  it 's to do with labour law reform ? 
  that 's as much as i know at the mo , would like to know more . 
  i always admired french protest/riot culture . 
  keep on keepin ' on lads . 
   and i 've been wanting to move to ireland , dublin specifically , and was curious if i could still own a gun legally there . 
  ah right so ... no you probably wo n't be able to own a gun . 
  ireland is super strict on guns , i 've never seen a gun in ireland , the first time i saw them was when i was in spain being held by a policeman . 
  our police do n't carry guns and there 's not even any at on airport security ( usually where you 'll see them in other eu countries ) . 
  people in rural ireland have shotguns or rifles and the legislation is very similar to that of the uk 's . 
  but afaik you need to be a part of shooting club to have one and i 'm not sure many of those exist in dublin more in the west/midlands where there are more open spaces . 
  also you 'd have to prove you have a safe place to store the weapon and if your renting i think you are automatically considered as not having a safe place , as your landlord would theoretically have access to your gun/you are on a comparatively short lease so they 're not gon na check the security every time you move . 
   the european council , council of europe , and council of the european union the council of europe is separate to the eu , and instead of the council of the european union i would opt for it 's other more descriptive title ` the council of ministers ' personally . 
  i often feel many purposely latch on to this confusing wording as an example of eu bureaucratic nonsense , rather than it being a really simple issue that was largely unintentional . 
  ** the commission ** has 28 members appointed by the governments of the eu ( one per country ) and approved by the parliament . 
  the president of the commission is put forward by the party that gets the most seats in the parliament ( like a pm ) . 
  they can write laws . 
  ** the parliament ** is directly elected by the people of europe and they fall into national parties as well as larger pan-european parties . 
  the parliament is ruled by a centrist grand coalition at the mo , made by the epp , s&d and alde . 
  they pass laws or block them demanding amendments . 
  ** the council of ministers ** has 28 seats and a president . 
  one seat per country . 
  they are filled by the relevant minister from the 28 democratically elected governments of the eu , relevance determined by the law being discussed , ie : if it 's to do with sanctions , each country will send their foreign minister , if it 's to do with the economy , each country sends their finance minister etc. 
  every so often the heads of government meet as well to advise and set an overall eu agenda . 
  the council can also pass and block laws demanding amendments . 
  they vote under two systems depending on the law , most of the time you need a unanimous vote or they 'll use the qmv system ( a kinda supermajority ) where min . 
  16 countries representing at least 55 % of the eu pop are needed to pass the vote . 
  for a law made by the commission to pass it needs approval from both the council and the parliament . 
  an eu-wide vote happens every five years , this effects both the commission and parliament . 
  the council of ministers is only effected by general elections in the 28 member states . 
  i think it 's democratic , it 's very similar in how a typical european parliamentry system works . 
  the only issue with eu democracy imho is participation . 
  there are eu votes , eu news and stories that can only be discussed when properly informed about how it all works and what powers the eu has but that does n't exist , but this is n't the eu 's fault really , i 'd blame the media and politicians that use the eu as a scapegoat and otherwise do n't talk positively about it or it 's potential . 
  ** edit : ** just to clarify the above point ; i often see politicians who paint the eu as inherently good or inherently evil . 
  the eu is an institution , filled with politicians and civil servants with views , ideas and goals , some influenced by those they represent and some influenced by the idea of power/influence . 
  like any form of government really . 
  painting with such broad strokes with no targeted criticism makes people look uninformed to me . 
  ** / edit ** also if i had a wishlist , stricter lobbying laws and make the council of ministers advisory and replace it with a 56 member elected senate ( two seats per country ) but i would also wish the same of all governments and particularly the house of lords in the uk . 
  / ramblings, 
  heard a mate use the term ` cul de sac of delusion ' to describe a brexit , i 'd agree with that . 
  we think it 's nonsense , dangerous and all discussion of the eu in the uk is toxic and far removed from rationality . 
  not an issue in ireland , but i am seeing all-gender toilets ( ie . 
  just toilets ) appear in more offices and colleges here though . 
  we still have gendered toilets in the gaeltacht to fuck with tourists though , because it 's hilarious ( the irish for women is mn\u00e1 and men is fir so we use m and f on toilet doors ), 
  important viewing on accents in ireland https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee_n3g4orlk ireland recently has refrained from standard pronounciation/dialects because that is usually where elitism is born , also english is n't quite our language so we 're not gon na go about making rules and the like . 
  there are posh accents , like south dublin 's dart-speak and travellers have unique accents that i 'm sure slightly older generations have nasty gut reactions to , that would be the closest to aave we have in ireland . 
  if you are african , asian , south american etc there is one of two things happening in ireland . 
  you were born elsewhere and you still retain the accent of where you are from , immigration is still new to ireland so this is quite common . 
  you were born here and you have your local irish accent . 
  traveller accents and their languages might be the closest thing to compare to here in ireland . 
  that 's a very idealistic view on how referendums work , a result does n't silence the opposition , when a party gets a majority in parliament the other parties do n't just all give up . 
  when the uk voted to stay out of the euro , the people who were in favour of joining the euro only stopped talking about it when the euro-crisis happened . 
  ireland 's opposition to the lisbon treaty went away when it became painfully obvious that the lisbon treaty was n't going to result in the eu forcing abortion laws on ireland , like the opposition said it would . 
  that moment has n't happened yet for scottish independence , nothing has happened that shows the scots that remaining in the uk was the right decision . 
  the possibility of a brexit ( an idea that 's very undesirable in scotland ) has highlighted what pro-independence campaigners/voters have been saying for years which is the scots and the rest of the british are politically very distinct . 
  also you seem to be under the impression that we are saying scotland can block the eu remain/leave vote . 
  they ca n't , but if they are forced out they will very likely call a second referendum on independence . 
  which is fine and very democratic . 
  i think the redhead aspect is actually from nordic countries . 
  the celts were mostly brown haired , since they were from central/western europe , and irish/scottish people are mostly brown-haired as well . 
  the redhead thing is greatly exaggerated . 
   and ireland . 
  we are more celt than viking is probably why, 
  hahah it 's alright , i have never seen a hiberno-english voice on a gps . 
  tis weird to me, 
   irish man called sheamus clearly an american , no irishman spells s\u00e9amus this way . 
   in britain , are people with a different accent treated differently , perceived differently ? 
  are there accents that sound ` smart ' or ` dumb ' for example ?
