you seem to think i 'm trying to talk you out of your frack the world plan . 
  i 'm not . 
  i know the limits of my powers of persuasion and i would n't waste the effort on you . 
  go right ahead . 
  the eu will be more progressive without the uk veto . 
  i 'm sure scotland will be delighted to sell you clean drinking water after you 've fucked all your aquifers . 
  dublin will boom after your banks and investment companies bail out of london . 
  it 's a win-win for everyone except england and wales , so please go right ahead . 
  the eu has the largest gdp on the planet so we 've got more bargaining power in the wto than the uk does . 
  150 countries have ratified the paris agreement and the uk has agreed to be bound to the terms of that agreement . 
  if you think you can unilaterally break that agreement just try it and see what happens . 
  i dare you , i double dare you . 
  my prediction is the rest of the world is going to come down on you like a ton of bricks and you 'll end up paying double in international carbon taxes . 
  you 're going to look pretty damn foolish after scotland pulls out of the uk and ireland reunites and the commonwealth implodes . 
  the usa might give you a trade deal but that 's because they 're also rapidly running out of political capital . 
  okay , do whatever you want . 
  we 'll put a levy on uk goods to acknowledge the fact that you want to fuck the planet . 
  your move . 
  where did you get the crazy notion that corruption does n't exist in non-eu countries ? 
  and why did you build a shitty product ? 
  you have so many to chose from you ca n't keep up . 
  go on , tell me i know nothing again . 
  jeez , that 's fucking rich coming from you when you literally just refused to provide backing for your previous statement . 
  i know that the ecsc was founded to prevent wars in europe . 
  i know that none of the members of that organization have gone to war with another member of that organization since it was founded . 
  that 's empirical evidence that it works . 
  your claim that american dominance is the reason is rubbish . 
  you could claim that jet airliners are the reason . 
  you could claim that nuclear submarines are the reason . 
  they 're all non-sequiters . 
  correlation does not equal causation . 
  you still have n't named a country . 
  just one . 
  ca n't back up your trash talk eh ? 
  you think eu members would start wars with each other ? 
  like uk and france lobbing nukes across the channel ? 
  and the us * prevents * wars now ? 
  is that the same us that 's currently involved in something like 20 wars worldwide ? 
  the same us that kicked off the clusterfuck in iraq that 's spilled all over the world at this point ? 
  gim me a fucking break . 
  that ai n't no country i ever heard of . 
  do they speak english in south and ee ? 
  name an eu country that has n't benefited from it . 
  not op , but the eu has prevented a major war in europe for ~ 70 years . 
  look at the 60 years before the eu was founded and compare it to the 60 since it was founded . 
  i might be insane but at least i can wrap my head around numbers with more than one digit in them . 
  here 's a fact for you , the chances of being born on 9/11 2001 are higher than the chances of dying on 9/11 2001 . 
  the largest terror attack in the last 50 years is still a miniscule event . 
  i knew people that were killed by terrorists , 2 to be precise . 
  i also knew 1000s of people that died in other ways . 
  the end result was pretty much the same . 
  the amount of hours that get wasted on talking about killing mooselambs adds up to millions of hours everyday . 
  every 700,000 hours is another lifetime down the drain . 
  i 'd tell you to just get on with your life but i doubt you know how . 
  you nutjobs just want to take away everyones freedom because you 're too afraid to be free yourselves . 
  being a grownup is just too hard , it was so much easier when your mommy and daddy made all your decisions for you . 
  fuck off back to t_d where your friends are celebrating this as an excuse to kill mooselambs . 
  i agree with you , but there is the [ paradox of tolerance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paradox_of_tolerance ) . 
  we have to walk the fine line between intolerance and carelessness . 
  the correct degree of vigilance is what we should be debating . 
  personally , i think it 's pretty close to correct at the moment . 
  the right to free travel in the eu is very valuable and it should n't be restricted for the sake of saving a few dozen/hundred lives every year . 
  similarly , the ability to own a vehicle and drive long distances in short periods of time is very valuable and should n't be taken away because people die in road traffic accidents . 
   450,000 babies ** each year **  1,275,000 native babies are born ** each year **  1,725,000 babies are born ** each year ** tell that to op, 
  explain again how 1,000,000 women give birth to 1,725,000 babies each year . 
  this is fascinating . 
  we already do . 
  there 's tons of tax breaks for having kids . 
  there 's government payouts that benefit people with children . 
  there 's free public education ( babysitting/childcare ) for children that 's paid for by people without children . 
  with a chainsaw . 
  it 's a pity vince did n't store it in the poachers colon before he was shot . 
  in some parts of africa the rangers have sedated rhinos and surgically removed their horns to discourage poachers . 
  it 's not harmful to the rhino because rhino horn is just made of the same stuff as toe nails or finger nails . 
  i think they might have to start doing that in zoos too . 
   really ? 
  you 're judging all of america 's history on 3 weeks ? 
  bush also had unilateral policies and was the first real indicator that the us ca n't be trusted on long term agreements like climate change . 
  we gave them the benefit of the doubt and wrote it off as an anomaly . 
  now 8 years later trump arrives in the wh and makes bush seem like a sane person . 
  the bottom line is that us politics is so chaotic and divisive it 's like they 're obliged to have a revolution every 4-8 years and tear up any agreements or policies make since the previous revolution . 
  their economy is heading for another huge crash in the next few years and i 'd like to see the rest of the world have a backup plan to prevent them taking all of us down with them . 
  great news . 
  i hope we get a 10 % increase every year for the near future . 
  did you know that you are on the internet ? 
  the question mark gives it away . 
  gun freedom/gun control are not right wing/left wing policies . 
  that 's an illusion that ironically stems from two right wing parties in one particular country using gun control as a [ wedge issue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wedge_issue ) to lock in blocks of voters . 
  other wedge issues adopted by those parties are contradictory to their stances on gun control , but apparently that does n't stop the sheep that soak up their message campaigns like dry sponges . 
  wedge issues come from the elite of political parties , not from the voters themselves . 
  i 'm fed up with being told that i should believe certain viewpoints on issue a if i profess to have a certain stance on a completely unrelated issue b. i am capable of thinking for myself and just because i agree with you on some things do n't be surprised/offended/shocked if i disagree with you on many other things . 
   the us was doing those things in response to sovie aggression bullshit . 
  they were doing those things because they wanted to pillage the resources of the countries they invaded . 
  and that 's what they did in most of those countries . 
  [ they do n't even try to pretend it 's about freedom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gosbqs6y8um ) . 
   you should be thankful sure , just like all the iraqis , and libyans , and afghans , and syrians should be grateful that they 've been liberated by the us . 
  the only major industry left in the us is arms , munitions and war . 
  what you have is a death economy that requires the blood and lives of foreign brown people to keep it ticking over . 
   not related to current events the actions of the us in destabilising the me are extremely relevant to current events . 
  do you even understand the clusterfuck of opposing factions fighting in syria right now ?
