  it definitely was n't self-emancipation of the oppressed peoples of the world , nope . 
  how do people not realise that this refugee crisis was caused by invading the middle east to start with ? 
  how do they not realise that fucking up countries with our wars and our multinationals is the core of the problem ? 
   it 's no different than drawing a penis on the school wall . 
  pretty sure drawing a dick on a wall is different to the literal flag of the nazi party . 
  yeah , there seems to be a consensus gas has been used on kurds somewhere . 
  which kurds it was and who it was that used it are a mystery though . 
  you should probably tell that to the imf who 's studies show positive correlation between gdp and redistribution of wealth to the bottom 80 % of the society . 
  or you could have a common sense understanding of the market and concepts like purchasing power . 
  that would also work . 
   if it 's just western meddling and nothing else , where is the buddhist version of isis ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/969_movement  where are the christian african versions of iran and taliban ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lord%27s_resistance_army https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-balaka i do n't think i should have to produce an example of dictatorships in predominantly christian countries . 
  we had quite a few in europe up until quite recently . 
  then of course you have the [ jewish state of israel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/israel ) which is currently ethnically cleansing arabs . 
  looking outside of africa/mideast ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ku_klux_klan https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuity_irish_republican_army https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/real_irish_republican_army https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ulster_defence_association https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orange_volunteers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aryan_nations https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/army_of_god_ ( united_states )  why do n't south americans commit terrorism at the same rate of the middle-easterners ? 
  is this some kind of joke ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/farc https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mexican_drug_war  why are n't indigenous australians stoning women and homosexuals ? 
  i do n't know , they probably have something better to do with their lives ? 
  what does this have to do with anything except you contrasting people living in a conservative state with some randomly selected group which has absolutely no relation ? 
  that 's what all of this nonsense is . 
   but some lefties want to blame the west for everything bad just like some conservatives only want to blame islam . 
  believe it or not , the middle ground fallacy is n't the magical solution to life 's problems . 
  you do n't take two sides and say `` oh , it has to be a mix of them because reasons ! '', 
  imperialism - that is the military , political and economic domination of a nation - has * everything * to do with what 's going on , it has everything to do with the domestic terrorism we get , it has everything to do with the power vacuums created in the region , it has everything to do with the poverty and injustice , it has everything to do with the dictatorships and civil wars . 
  it is absolutely responsible for islamist extremism because it * created * all the conditions necessary for it to rise in the first place . 
  you do n't think saudi arabia 's political backing by the west has anything to do with the iron grip the regime has ? 
  it 's not a democracy for fuck sake , it 's an absolute monarchy and that you 're trying to use it as an example of a `` functioning '' muslim society which is also religiously conservative is ridiculous . 
  any country that is an absolute monarchy with a secret police that spends 11 % of its gdp on the military can not be claimed to be a perfectly functioning or in any way representative society . 
   - islam is a problem , and religious fundamentalist are the majority of muslims . 
  - western attack of secular dictators except trying to view things as isolated instances with no connection has absolutely no basis in reality . 
  and that 's not even with me challenging the truthfulness or not of those statements ( eg . 
  muslim fundies making up the majority ) . 
  the fact that you 're saying `` islam is a problem '' as if christian , buddhist , secular , nationalist etc. 
  terrorism is n't a thing is just ridiculous . 
  when you create a giant fucking power vacuum in a poor as fuck region you 're going to have a lot of extremism , in this case it was islamic fundamentalism . 
  trying to then view the rest of the world as isolated from this situation is pure idealism . 
  there are two things which create extremism ; 1 . 
  injustice 2 . 
  inequality * religion * no matter what the religion is , does n't do it . 
  it 's not magic . 
  if that was the case all 1.3 billion muslims would be running around with ak-47s and attacking every non-muslim in sight and would 've been for as long as islam existed . 
  but that 's not how the world works , it 's not some great clash of ideas , it 's social grievances looking for an outlet which , at the moment , is going into right wing terrorism . 
   i know generalising `` the left '' is never helpful , but from more than a decade of watching most social democrats/communists/anarchists / socialists blame the west or racism for isis/taliban/everything bad in dar al-islam , one notices a pattern . 
  what , because people do n't have a short memory and can analyse things systemically , now they 're in bed with islamists ? 
  is it islamist to say that isis was born from the invasion of iraq ? 
  is it now an islamist statement to say islamic terrorism is at an all time high after the muslim world being repeatedly invaded by the west ? 
  is it islamist to say that when a country is destroyed that people turn to extreme ideologies ? 
  apparently attempting to address the root cause of an issue as opposed to stumbling blindly from problem to problem is now getting in bed with islamists . 
  yes . 
  have you read their articles on him at all ? 
  their arguments boil down to `` vote burnham because reasons '' and `` if you do n't vote for the female candidate you 're a sexist '' . 
  corbyn is trying to bring labour back to its actually left wing roots as opposed to continuing with its continuous trajectory to the right and the guardian is throwing a fit . 
  here 's a tip : if your position runs counter to the working class grassroots movement and the vast majority of the trade union movement , you 're probably not espousing something that 's of a left wing character . 
  which left is he talking about ? 
  which parties , which individuals ? 
  which organisations ? 
  i hate to break it to people , but the guardian is not the left wing of the uk , and it 's [ hardly progressive either ] ( http://www.sodiumhaze.org/2015/07/26/the-guardian-has-morphed-into-the-daily-mail-so-elect-corbyn-and-ignore-them/ ) . 
  if you 're not sure of that take a look at its coverage of the recent labour leadership elections in which they 've been a hardline anti-left publication . 
  the torygraph 's coverage of greece was far more sympathetic than the guardian 's , on top of that . 
  what little `` left '' was on the guardian 's centre-left credentials , they 've dropped it . 
  other than that , this article 's a load of nonsense . 
  it does n't address the arguments of the british left nor even the arguments of the british centre-left , more it tries to - unsurprisingly given it 's coming from a liberal - present a caricature of the left and then refutes that caricature . 
  funny how you invoke your great uncle 's memory and then shit all over it with xenophobia . 
  poetic juxtaposition . 
  right wing politicians . 
  i do n't doubt there 's some racism in the police forces as well ( there always is ) but i do n't know so i wont comment on that . 
   i ca n't comprehend why political leaders and the administration ( local , + police ) are n't putting in the effort to address this . 
  they stirred up the xenophobia and now they 're reaping the rewards . 
  if people want to fight fascism they need to do it themselves . 
  rejecting liberal democracy is not anti-democratic so long as they support a democratic society in principle . 
  to say otherwise is extreme centrism and is really just taking a narrow view to social organisation imo . 
  one can reject liberalism and still be very pro-democracy - this is very common , actually . 
  antifa is certainly flawed ( for example , attacking people who are not necessarily fascist as you said ) but they 're nothing like fascists . 
  simply saying `` well shit , both these people use violence therefore they are the same '' is like saying the axis and allies are two sides of the same coin because they both fought in a war . 
  we both know that 's not clever . 
   `` fascist '' implying there 's no fascists in europe . 
  fucking deluded . 
   protests are almost always without any property damage utterly false . 
  migrant centres are * constantly * being arson attacked . 
  just over a week ago fascists ransacked a commercial district in leipzig . 
  on top of this , property damage is not the only thing that matters - they attack * people * and drive * people * out of communities , they make * people * both actively unsafe and feel unsafe . 
  anti-fascists are those who protect communities from these people - almost always peacefully and in defense until antifa is attacked itself . 
  pegida has been around for years and has a fascist core leading it . 
  i 'm not getting into a tired argument about immigration , because frankly anyone who supports fascism because they 're scared of brown people ( as if europe is n't riddled with white murderers , rapists and pedophiles ) i have no time for . 
  that 's an extremely reductionist criticism and it lacks political content . 
  as any student of history should know - or anyone who 's been paying attention to the development of european fascism over the last decade should know - the state is extremely incapable of dealing with fascism . 
  that 's because there 's a broad layer of support for fascism in the state apparatus , particularly amongst police forces - for example over half of greek cops vote for golden dawn . 
  you 've made a mistake liberals often make , and it 's conflating the rule of law with democracy . 
  preserving democracy often means breaking laws to fight injustice . 
  you could be a law-above-all person but that is n't democracy , that 's legalism . 
  videos do n't show everything at all times at all places at all protests . 
  there are countless cases of fascist demonstrations not being met by antifa which then go on to attack people , damage property or even smash up entire sections of towns or cities . 
  it 's what they do and if you do n't oppose them from the start it 's what they all develop into - or something worse . 
  peaceful counter-demos get attacked either by the fascists or by police - usually fascists do not need to because police will do it for them . 
  being prepared for self-defense is a fundamental aspect of anti-fascism , because almost 100 % of the time you will need to do it . 
  anti-fascism fundamentally takes on the perspective of doing what the state will not do because it is either complicit in the existence of fascism , or - as is often the case - unable to deal with it . 
  that is - defend communities , workers , labour organisations , and immigrants from fascist abuse , violence and other things that come with movements like pegida . 
  you do n't do that by letting them beat you up , you do that by taking the fight to them . 
  how people here delude themselves into ignoring fascism is beyond me .
