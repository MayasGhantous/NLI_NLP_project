  killed 14 peaceful protesters ** and lied ** about them having weapons . 
  basically , the cossacks could n't sustain their army in supply anymore and crumpled due to shortages , this happened early in the year . 
  thats where you see ukraine fall . 
  by november deniken , or something like that had stretched the white forces so thin that they had no depth to their lines and lacked the supplies to hold a front line and promptly collapsed , which is the massive gains you see . 
  they belong to the sea now boy , let it go . 
  it will only hurt more if you try to hold on . 
  i 've seen a woman heavily pregnant chain smoking and planning a night out . 
  i wonder how this is measured . 
  i think we just have to make a decision about where the most realistic place to put the limit is , with a view of reducing decision dissatisfaction from extremely close votes , and without crippling democracy by setting the number to some extremely high figure . 
  i feel that this number falls between 54 % -66 % , for a number of reasons that i could talk for days about , but where * exactly * the threshold falls could be debated . 
  i think it is definitely arbitrary to some extent , but we can still choose the * least * arbitrary or at least a most justifiable place to put it with some study and discussion . 
  i think other numbers are * less * arbitrary , a qualified majority to settle an issue for the long term . 
  a 50 % +1 often leaves more than half the people unsatisfied , whereas even a few percentage more swings that to a `` true '' majority where things are much less ambiguous . 
  2/3 majority is unrealistic with large populations , 55.56 % is more than enough of a majority for an issue to be settled in a large population . 
  that means a 5:4 vote , if both sides fail to reach 55.56 % then the issue is put on hold for x time and so on . 
  in a 5:4 vote that means 25 % more people wanted something than the other , or a 25 % relative majority . 
  yes the legend changing super annoyed me . 
  here is a revised version with a common 100-81 , 80-61 , 60-41 , 40-21 . 
  20-1 scale . 
  its not perfect , but its better in my opinion , anything that was too hard for me to click on easily without zooming in was ignored so some places ( like malta ) are probably the wrong colour . 
  i might have forgot to recolour ni in the uk in one of them but i aint going back to fix it mainly out of laziness . 
  http://imgur.com/a/oy8rw i think i forgot to remove the legend in one of them too out of sheer post-christmas apathy but what can you do ? 
  you are conflating current monetary assets with prosperity over time . 
  prosperity is not money , and money is n't prosperity . 
  you know what that money is spent on right ? 
  things like roads , infrastructure and enterprise . 
  this is n't a project where you invest for a few years and see a return , investing in eu infrastructure and enterprise is beneficial over generations . 
  the netherlands has a population of 16.8 million , a land area of 41,543 km ^ 2 with a density of 488 people/km ^ 2 . 
  poland has a population of 38.5 million , a land area of 312,679 km \u00b2 with a density of 122 people/km ^ 2 . 
  the two countries are not even remotely comparable especially when you consider that the netherlands has a history of being a rich nation and were luckily on the western side of the iron curtain . 
  ireland was one of the poorest nations in europe a generation or two ago , and now today we are a set to be a net payer into the eu in the next year or two . 
  it makes sense that the least developed regions of the eu will receive the most funding as they have the most `` easy '' growth to be achieved making them simply the most economically sensible investments . 
  something as simple as making mechanized farming equipment available to farmers can drastically develop a countries infrastructure as less people will be required for farming freeing up manpower for more productive and specialist work . 
  for example employment in agriculture in ireland has gone from 16 % + of the population to around 5 % + over roughly 30 years . 
  poland is sitting around 13 % ish at the moment as a comparison . 
  the investments are n't really things you can see in 2-3 years , but you ask any pole who moved away from poland around 2004 and came back 5-10 years later and they will tell you the difference in their countries economic prosperity , especially if they are from a city . 
  poverty and wealth is not a zero sum game . 
  increasing serbia 's prosperity does n't take prosperity away from anyone else . 
  specialization of industry and the harnessing of skills can lead to overall wealth increases accross the board . 
  lets say serbia and hungary both produce chairs and tables . 
  lets say they split their production in half between the two . 
  with serbia can produce 60 chairs and 30 tables , whereas hungary can produce 40 chairs and 40 tables . 
  that means the total number of chair and tables in the economy is 100 and 70 . 
  however if serbia specializes in making chairs , they can produce 120 , and hungary can specialize in making tables to produce 80 . 
  if they then trade tables for chairs together freely , over-all the amount of goods in the economy has gone up , increasing productivity and prosperity without actually increasing the manufacturing capacity . 
  no imagine you could invest 800 chairs into serbia so that they produce 240 chairs , it only takes a few production cycles to reap the benefits on the free market . 
  higher minimum wages are actually co-related with lower employee turnover and reduce employee training costs [ because its more expensive to keep getting new employees and training them ] . 
  there is little-to no observable correlation between minimum wage and general unemployment/employment . 
  it also tends to save the government money as less people will qualify for means tested welfare , it also tends to cause consumer price inflation but it also increases consumer spending and reduces poverty rates . 
  there have been some studies that correlate minimum wage increases with lower employment for teens and unskilled labour , typically on the order of magnitude of 10:1 % . 
  that is for every 1 % you increase minimum wage , you expect 0.1 % less youth and unskilled employment . 
  4,325,000 youth ( age :15 -24 ) in spain . 
  youth unemployment rate = 42.6 % . 
  estimated employed youth : 2,482,550 estimate employed youth after wage increase : 2,447,950 jobs estimated to be lost : 34,600 wages earned pre-increase/month with full hours : $ 1,638,483,000 [ 1.63 billion ] wages earned post-increase/month with full hours : $ 1,744,898,760 [ 1.74 billion ] thats just looking at youth , i did n't bother looking up unskilled stats . 
  oh sorry i thought you wanted the meaning of the word . 
  nowadays when people talk about identity politics as if it a new ideology that is they are talking about a greoup they do n't care about who is protesting their status in society . 
  its very clear that anyone who uses identity politics as if it were a swear word is a part of the established status quo . 
  this same sort of shit went on in the aforementioned irish/polish/insert ethnicity here nationalist eras . 
  the reality is whether or not it is true identity politics is on the rise , identity politics ** is ** the * norm * and has been for the majority of history . 
  people who think this is some new thing are exactly the people who are respresented by the systems which the unrepresented people are protesting . 
  i could go on , but i think we both know what the user was getting at . 
  a lot of young people [ 16-30 ] are only now beginning to participate in the political landscape , had they been paying attention for all those years instead jumping in now and opening their mouths as if they speak gospel there would be a lot less turbulence in the political sphere and a lot more sensible discussion . 
  i think a cursory glance at the user 's post history would confirm this and establish a clear partisan leaning . 
  which direction they lean i will leave unstated . 
  unfortunately prosperity breeds a certain bit of political lazyness and it is only when the wine stops flowing do people realise they should participate in the governance of their society . 
  unfortunately by this point they lack a historical perspective but make up for that shortcoming with anger and ignorance . 
  its all perfectly predictable and normal human behavior . 
  edit : oh , and another part of it is class struggle . 
  every time there is a class struggle [ haves vs have nots ] there is a rise of what we call the `` left '' which is typically followed by a rise of what were call the `` right '' . 
  in reality it can be more adequately describe as oppressor vs oppressed , status quo vs change , which then one side is typically hijacked and used as a platform to simply eradicate the previous `` haves '' with a new set of social-political-economic overlords who pass just enough reforms to end the class struggle for now , or merely replace the oppressor class and proclaim the class struggle over with the regular joe on the street no better and often worse off . 
  that at least is my analysis , i could be wrong . 
  a class struggle can be over wealth , freedom , race whatever . 
  all that it takes is for an inequality [ or even merely the perception of an inequality ] to exist and for the struggle to become public and polarizing . 
  edit2 : i cleaned up the language and grammar/syntax and sentence structure . 
  i worded this extremely poorly and upon re-reading it came across as incomprehensible . 
  20 % of our politicians are landlords . 
  the upper and upper middle class older than 45 often have more than one property [ sometimes properties in other european countries also ] . 
  the older generation , in the bracket of 45-70ish all got houses for near nothing and had the perfect economy to build wealth within . 
  many of them opted to buy second homes , sometimes even third and fourth homes specifically to rent them out as it was a way to generate passive income while also having an asset that would retain it 's value [ at least until the housing crash ] . 
  after the crash housing prices were even further suppressed by low confidence in the market . 
  most construction sites lay bare for years with property developers who survived the crash only building very conservative developments that were relatively small in size with a view to either hold them for rent and resale in a better market as well as large property holding companies building some small developments to expand their rental property holdings in ireland . 
  this restriction of supply happened at exactly the same time there was a small baby boom in ireland meaning there was a massive uptick in demand in the pipeline with no correlating supply in the pipeline . 
  the suppression of supply through low market confidence , a high percentage of people owning more than one home , and market strategy to increase property value have led us to a place where there is a supply crisis for first timer buyers . 
  as there are not enough houses to go around these people must rent . 
  however the rental market is also beyond capacity and as such landlords have started increasing prices knowing the demand is at a point where a property can sit empty for 2-4 months a year at an extortionate price and still be profitable as the supply is so thin people will pay nearly anything for housing . 
  there are more factors with this , and this is mainly a market correction that has gone too far that has yet to be corrected itself . 
  the housing and rental market was too low due to the crisis and now the housing and rental market is too high , fueling a boom of construction . 
  it is also much more common for people to be single parents , this increases the demand for housing as people who would have lived together in previous times are now both attempting to get housing . 
  there are numerous factors like this feeding into the problem [ as well as corruption and market manipulation ] . 
  the main takeaway is that the government failed to manage the crisis when it was in the pipeline , and now it has manifested itself . 
  whether that is through incompetance , or malice and vested interests looking to increase revenue is up to the reader . 
  source : i work in the industry . 
  political groups and movements based around race , gender , gender identity , ethnicicy , sexual orientation , disability , religion , culture , language and dialect as opposed political groups and movements based around broad base party politics . 
  which is odd because most of history is filled with identity politics . 
  [ irish nationalism in gbritain + ireland , polish nationalism under russian/german/austriahungary rule , even the 30 years war was religious identity as well as political ... ], 
  can you get sky sports on that though ? 
  is n't this the french process ? 
  elect someone , and immediately start sharpening the guillotine menacingly ? 
  aye , they were also big fans of preventing moving people around when it suited them . 
  in the age of nationalism and identity everything was political .
