  for example with a political campaign . 
  the reason anti-semitism has gone up in europe is primarily because of increase of muslim population , extremist left and extremist right politics having a resurgence . 
  at least that would be my best guess . 
  i do not know or have the data on whether anti-semitism has increased or decreased . 
  do you have that data ? 
   huh ? 
  there 's hundreds of unknown holocaust deniers . 
  in fact most of them are unknown to anyone , there 's not much people stupid enough to deny it in public . 
  how could i know if these people are linked to neo-national socialist movements ? 
  how could you ? 
  exactly . 
  the law is working as intended . 
  holocaust deniers can not publicly affirm their lies . 
  how could you know ? 
  there is these great things called google , research and effort . 
   so why do you believe that you and more particularly france is absolutely right and objective in it 's knowledge of history ? 
  because the vast majority of historians who have studied it who are n't racist and do n't have an agenda agree with me . 
  these are experts in the field who have studied the extensive evidence of the crimes . 
   now there , no one talked about denying genocide ** this conversation is * exclusively * about genocide . 
  go ask a historian . 
  / r/askhistorians holocaust deniers are almost exclusively racist and anti semites . 
  literally type `` holocaust denial '' into / r/askhistorians for all the facts you will ever need . 
  basically , berec is deciding upon the interpretation and implementation of the net neutrality legaislation that was passed in the european parliament in 2015 . 
  how certain things are interpreted and implemented in this could have profound impact on the internet in europe . 
  i will say this , the odds are good that berec rules on the side of the consumer with regards to these interpretations and subsequent implementation so support isnt super important passed a certain point . 
  ** however if you think net neutrality is important enough for 3 minutes of your time click the link in the video and send a letter to them through the auto generated webform set up . 
  ** every person sending them letters helps , and there is more information pertaining to the specific articles in the link in the video once you click through the submission form . 
  ** you do n't want to have done nothing if berec comes back with the bad answers ** . 
  considering 85 + % upvoted is generally considered to be 100 % due to how reddit fudges the numbers , the answer would be ** no one you fucking ideologue ** . 
  you are the most important nato member in south east europe/west asia . 
  the fuck up is in your leadership . 
  the point is you ca n't deny it on a public platform . 
  you 're not going to be prosecuted for questioning the genocide 's facts . 
  the reason these laws are implemented are because the deniers become such a big problem spreadong misinformation . 
  ask the dead . 
  go to / r/askhistorians and search `` holocaust denial '' . 
  you woll get good answers to your question . 
  they are not criminalising opinions . 
  it has n't even been voted on . 
  because denial of genocide is revisionism usually done by a party to justify future actions against a group or to downplay previous atrocities despite overwhelming evidence . 
   how does making it illegal stops it ? 
  does it stop people from talking about it on internet ? 
  does it stop them to talk about it in pubs , in their houses ? 
  it stops it from being used openly for a political platform . 
  you can save your moralistic idealism grand stand for someone who cares . 
  i live in the real world where holocaust deniers are new age anti-semites and have been proven to be using unsound methodology in their analysis of the holocaust in order to mislead people . 
  the law against revisionism of genocode and atrocities did n't come first . 
  the revisionism and denials did . 
   and when the police will go out of their way to prison those who challenge it . 
  when the police will take the liberties of those people for having challenged a widely accepted point of view . 
  what will the others think ? 
  what will the people that deny it but have not been caught think ? 
  what will the people that are skeptical think about it ? 
  why would you need to outlaw an opinion if it is as right as you claim it to be ? 
  name one instance where the police went out of their way . 
  name one holocaust denier who is 100 % free from links with neo-national socialist movements . 
  name one claim made by holocaust deniers that was substantiated/agreed with by a majority of historians that was not already an alestablished fact . 
  it is not an opinion being outlawed . 
  denying the holocaust is n't about denying the facts . 
  they are building a narrative to attack jewish people . 
  just go search `` holocaust denial '' in / r/askhistorians . 
   do you think no one is going to doubt an opinion because doubting it is illegal ? 
  i will tell you . 
  it 's the other way around . 
  the moment you outlaw the expression of an opinion , is the moment you show that you are worried about the said opinion . 
  not because of it 's dangerouseness , but because of how frail the opinion that is being challenged is . 
  you do not get to hide blatant misinformation , revisionism , genocide minimalism and bad historical practices behind them being `` opinions '' . 
  they have been proven false and only veeb used as ways to promote anti-semitism . 
  people are worried about the opinion , because we have lived though it before . 
  you might remember the thing called the holocaust . 
  the evidence is rock solid . 
  ask any historian . 
   i have not studied the armenian genocide , but never count on me trusting it happened exactly as we were told . 
  specifically because of this . 
  it 's a sad day when people have to point out that outlawing the expression of an opinion is wrong as better the world becomes because of it . 
  they are not expressing an opinion . 
  denying genocide is near exclusively used to promote campaigns of hateed or avoid social responsibility for atrocities . 
  i was talking about the holocaust . 
  refer to my previous comment on semantics . 
   just cause you can this wo n't prevent it from occurring what does this mean ? 
   it 's an idea . 
  it 's not something visible . 
  i do n't see how that matters . 
  could you explain why ? 
   people can use this in terrible ways like during the cold war where people would claim other people were communists so they would have to face a trial that would run their lives . 
  no actually they ca n't . 
  unlike the communists and nazis we have a thing called the burden of proof . 
  you ca n't just point a finger at someone and call them something without evidence free of repercussions . 
  ( at least thats how it should be , god knows the extreme right and left are trying to start this shit again with the extreme left screaming `` reactionary buzzword of the current year '' when someone says something they do n't like and the extreme right using this bullshit to grow their membership )  just because you do n't agree with a stance does n't mean it should be attacked like it 's completely evil . 
  have you read anything about holocause denial ? 
  people who deny the holocaust have been proven to be sidestepping historical methodology and found `` guilty '' ( but not legally punished ) of being racist and anti-semitic . 
  considering racism and anti-semitism lead to the holocaust ...  someday you might be the one who 'll face the scrutiny . 
  yes . 
  i might . 
  but i wont be scrutinised for denying the holocaust . 
   then who will protect you from the government ? 
  we will protect ourselves . 
  you would have to ask a swede . 
  i would speculate though : * negative coverage in the news * competition between forestry ( or others ) and agriculture . 
  * swedish food prices ( if they are high/low they might blame eu for meddling ),
