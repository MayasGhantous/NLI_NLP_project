  too many people seeing 2 days of currency fluctuation and saying `` lol get rekt gbp '' . 
   a republic ( from latin : res publica ) is a sovereign state or country [ 1 ] which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body [ 2 ] [ 3 ] and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law . 
  i 'm pretty sure republic is a perfectly acceptable term here by the definitions found online . 
  so your spiel is mostly nullified out the gate . 
  if by the definitions found online a republic means elected representatives then my statements are perfectly valid and do n't need to be changed to `` representative democracy '' . 
  a republic is a type of democratic government . 
  if you are to convince me otherwise , you need to provide me with links to reliable sources saying otherwise . 
  well ... thats err , good for you britain . 
  uhh , what ? 
  fair enough thanks for the info !, 
  / u/walt _ ru is n't a russian troll but we 're well versed in dealing with his particular brand of mental deficiency in / r/ireland . 
  hes what you might call a `` red headed step child '' . 
  i did n't take a moral stance on the advancement , nor did i way what was advanced . 
  it could be bad things advancing , technology ; social advancement on an individual level . 
  the statement is amoral : conflict creates change . 
  its a simplified analysis . 
  but fairly accurate imo aside from small criticism . 
  could n't they have withdrawn support from the government over the uni fees ? 
  i do n't think theres an inherant problem with referendums . 
  its just certain things are much easier to vote for than others . 
  its a reason most places are republics . 
  conflict creates advancement . 
  honestly when you fly ryanair you feel a bit like you 're being smuggled illegally over the boarder . 
  68 % of gamers are over the ages of 18 . 
  32 % are not . 
  thats not how you narrow it down . 
  those numbers are ** way to speculative ** to make any real conclusions . 
  we can only speak in nebulous terms here because we do n't even know what the voting demographics of gamers look like . 
  its entirely possible gamers voted 50:50 , or 60:40 . 
  the only safe conclusions we can make is that it is ** probable ** they were more likely to be motivated to vote for remain . 
  its also extremely important to remember that dank memers are communities , they do n't meme in isolation . 
  its very possible the petition was posted somewhere and a group of people ( not even necessarily gamers ) decided to set their residence as the vatican ** or ** north korea . 
  if i was n't clear , north korea is another memey place that people also set their location to occasionally because they think its funny . 
  to reiterate my point , the people who run the petition have the concrete information they need in order to decide if a petition has been tampered with and any discussion on this is pretty wild speculation . 
  the point , i think you missed , is that there are 5.5 million uk steam users ( online pc games distribution platform ) . 
  less than 1 % of those people had to be motivated to sign the petition [ consider the average age of a gamer is 35 in uk , average age of uk is 40 , and younger people were more likely to support remain ] and select their residence as a silly place ( something pc gamers are more likely than others to do ) and it does n't seem entirely unfeasible . 
  its possible , and more likely than you originally assessed . 
  i 'm not saying the petition has 100 % not been tampered with , but i think there are far more compelling grounds to make the argument that it has been tampered with , which only the people who run the petition website have . 
  online pc gamers are known for occasionally picking the vatican as their place of residence for laughs . 
  it could be british gamers doing so , or it could be something else . 
  i just checked it . 
  its 3 million . 
  `` lets never try democracy again , democracy is a silly place . '', 
  brutal comes first you false memer . 
  i think most people would * like * a united ireland , but our relations with the uk have been so good in the years since the gfa that theres no mobilisation of will to actually do anything about because the peace is so prosperous . 
  this is exactly the same sort of things people said about the brexit . 
  the point , is ireland will be very badly damaged if the brexit is mishandled by the eu ( read : britain not treated with friendship , respect and professional courtesy ) it could lay the ground work for an irish movement to leave the eu . 
  i 'm not saying it will happen , but its certainly a possible outcome . 
  since forever because i am a moderate and like to hear both sides so i can point out hypocrysy no matter who wins . 
  i hate all sides equally my dear . 
  its actually an 8 % relative majority . 
  ( ( 51.9 / 48.1 ) -1 ) * 100 = 7.9 % more people voted for leave than remain . 
  farage himself said 48-52 . it was 51.9:48.1, 
   they 're buying influence, 
  thats for private investors . 
  the cic ( national investment ) have near a trillion invest worldwide iirc . 
  i think a 60 % majority would be excessive personally . 
  a 55:45 split is 10 % of the population ( 122.2 % majority ) which seems much more reasonable than a 60:40 split ( 150 % majority ) since we 'd probably get nothing done at that level . 
  but a 52:48 majority seems far to slight a difference to make a definitice decision , something farage himself said of the brexit . 
  speaking personally . 
  i would n't respect a result lower than 55 % for any decision other than what to buy for dinner . 
  the problem is that these sort of things are ignored by the winners . 
  if you win by 1 % you 're not very motivated to fix the system that allowed you to win by 1 % and the people who lost by 1 % are ignored . 
  it 'll keep happening until its remedied . 
  edit : i 'm actually in favour of a 54.55 % minimum , which is the threshold to have just about 20 % more people than the losing 45.45 %, 
  i hope there is no vengeance exacted upon the uk . 
  i hope we break amiably . 
  i do n't want emotion to rule the diplomatic process , mutual respect must be foundation that we build upon our relationships inside or outside the eu . 
  its the most dangerous part of any social system . 
  it is where potential indoctrination begins . 
  if you ** want ** to destroy the eu this is what you do . 
  there are huge implications of the brexit , if you fuck around pushing for a use and do n't deal with the fallout of ireland and britain 's trade/border consequences ireland will be leaving the eu next . 
  better politicians hang than the british people . 
  the majority of people are always correct . 
  its known as majority intelligence totally not a fallacy or anything . 
  world used to be flat , germs used to be based on the humours and owning people was allowed . 
  / s the eu project will continue no matter how many people call for leaving . 
  china/chinese investors invests everywhere near simultaneously . 
  they are shotgunning money around the world to build their global status a la the usa . 
  they 're buying influence . 
  you mean the world of china that desperately and constantly begs for better access to markets to fuel their grotesque national industrial wasteland experiment while lieing through their teeth about the realities of the consequences of that industry ? 
  in the game of thrones , you win or you die . 
  holy mother of false equivalences . 
  they have more than 2 options . 
  we respect their decision and should co-operate with them . 
  but they should recieve no special treatment . 
  the irish 'd like a word about cromwell . 
  he did a good job with the whole parliament business , but that does n't prevent him from being a cunt . 
  he indirectly and directly killed , maimed , starved and enslaved 1/3 of the irish population during his 4 year campaign . 
  one does not claim to be unbiased . 
  one demonstrates it . 
  uh no it would n't . 
  there would be refugee camps to hold them until the conflict is resolved , and the most at risk and compatible refugees would be resettled in europe . 
  hence the whole `` its cheaper to pay for them outside europe than in '' . 
  refusing to destroy yourself to save another is not the same as murder . 
  yeah , because the scale goes from `` mediocre '' to `` horrific '', 
  thats what i said . 
  my point was that the uk became tremendously prosperous under the eu and now they throw it all away over misinformation and nationalism . 
  the way the cow 's 've made it for centuries . 
  pound dropping is more significant due to britains import heavy economy .
