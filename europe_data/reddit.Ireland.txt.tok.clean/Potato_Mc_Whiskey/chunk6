  kerrygold would be pretty high up imo . 
  not because its really high quality , mostly because the scale goes from `` real butter '' all the way to `` unrefined milk atrocity '' . 
  that scale goes even lower if you count that low low shite !, 
  nah mate , we were talking about them being represented in the referendum and you brought up their mps . 
  hence , disingenuous . 
  ah well , its easy if you just be disingenuous . 
  ca n't all be sensible about the conversation . 
  that 'd be boring . 
  aye , and it wont soon be forgotten . 
  why should 14 % of the population not be represented ? 
  send them back to where they came from . 
  every single migrant who died making the journey 's blood is on the hands of the immigrant enablers who indirectly encouraged the behaviour by not policing it . 
  we should send them back to where they came from , and then sink the boats when they arrive back to where they came from . 
   kill millions would you fucking listen to yourself . 
  holy mother of false dochotomies you realise we can prevent mass immigration without killing millions ? 
  the only reason millions are coming is because we 're not stopping them . 
  taking down kingpins is cutting the head off the hydra . 
  as long as smuggling people is profitable it will be done . 
  you mean the ** global ** economic crisis that hit everyone ? 
  to be fair thats the import and family planning initiative as well . 
  we 're glad to see it blow up in the face of the misinforming political class who championed the leave . 
  my sympathy does rest with british people . 
  its cheaper to help them where they are than import them . 
  the blue 'll be coming off your flag , your scientific sector will wither and you 'll have a tough time competing in the eu markets with all those exports you do n't have . 
  the poor and rural will suffer the hardest and they 'll ask why the ever wanted to leave . 
  the future damage done to your country is so great that it 'd qualify as burning if you ask me . 
  `` something my country did negatively affected your country , but its your countries fault not our countries fault '' wow . 
  just wow . 
  i 'm glad your country will burn if thats how the average brit thinks . 
  i thought we had good relations but eh ,, 
  its not that they hate democracy . 
  its that they hate the effectiveness of ignorance celebration , disdain for experts and misinformation/false promises . 
  the grey vote is a real thing , and many governments in ireland have used benefits for old people promises as ways to get elected , which is scummy as fuck . 
  irelands stock market crashed 10-20 % today , and 20 % of our gdp depends on britain . 
  i 'd say we 're allowed be bitter you fucked us . 
  i think his misread `` implement '' as `` implemented '' . 
  iseq down 10-20 % man . 
  he basically led the british public into ruin at the hands of misinformation mills and ran the most lackluster remain campaign imaginable . 
  he could have mobilized more than half of parliament but instead sat on his hands balls deep in a pig . 
  he called the vote because he wanted to get elected . 
  basically - `` a society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in . '' uk right now - `` a societies youth collectively loses its shit when selfish old men spit on their future '', 
  people born from 1946-1964 are widely considered hugely poisonsous and selfish in their actions with regards to the generation that preceeds them and follows them in uk and usa . 
  they had cheap housing , healthcare , low unemployment + a myriad of other good shit and yet voted to destroy and dismantle the systems that gave them that prosperity because `` they got theirs '' . 
  i do n't know if its true or not but a lot of people think it is . 
  scotchland . 
  we 'll haf ` ta start givin ' ou ' lessins now te make shoor ev'ry won is sayin ' i ' righ ' . 
  furst lessin : ye do n't say the gee at de end of `` doin ' '' verbs . 
  going becomes goin ' and so on and so forth . 
  wait thats accents nevermind . 
  right , well the first thing i have ` ta tell yis , is that we have a special contraction for `` am not '' its `` am n't '' . 
  its an old english contraction but we 're fierce proud of our hiberno english . 
  please stop using megathreads . 
  40 % -50 % ish of the population wants reunification . 
  50-60 % ish of the population wants to remain in uk . 
  5-10 % want independance . 
  ( numbers sourced from the grizzled depths of my arsehole and are purely illustrative rather than informative ) reunification is the independance faction technically speaking . 
  actually beleiving the `` 350m '' on boris johnsons bus will be put into the nhs is laughable . 
  * nothing is self apparent . 
  explain exactly which specific bits of soverignty the uk gets back from leaving the eu * why is immigration a big concern ? 
  * incorrect . 
  if you want to trade with the eu you are going to pay money and and follow the same regulations you do now and have no political power to influence the eu as an outsider . 
  membership fees still apply if you want to trade with eu like you used to but not be inside the eu . 
  you have essentially given up ** all ** of your negotiating power with the eu , and are now at it 's mercy . 
  * again you 're going to have to be really really specific . 
  ireland suffers the most of all . 
  whilst singing `` rule britannia '' in the nip . 
  in order for me to go on , you need to provide something concrete as opposition . 
  you can not hide behind weasel words such as `` there were other factors '' . 
  name the factors , and pick your hill to die on . 
  i did ? 
  thats funny because you were the one who said britain did n't need the eu . 
  remember the suez crisis ? 
  slowest growth outside eu ? 
  the horrific mismanagement of the troubles ? 
  need i go on ? 
  no it would potentially get them * in * to the eu if other nations make a stink about it . 
  just like all that detail you provided , good to see you hold yourself to the same standards you disingenuous prick . 
  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/202a60c0-cfd8-11e5-831d-09f7778e7377.html the graphs you want is near the bottom . 
  i know reading is such a struggle . 
  megathreads are awful . 
  please stop using them . 
  thats probably how the irish could backdoor the scots into the eu , by `` unifying '' the countries , as the united republics of ireland and scotland . 
  uris if you will , we just need a t and the urist dream is complete . 
  i mean , its a wild idea , and horrifically unlikely . 
  but i dream of urist mchammerfist . 
  maybe . 
  there will be at least some violence . 
  theres always violence . 
  majority population of ni is unionist . 
  `` the dogs are howlin ' again ma '' `` tell them to shut tae fuck up '', 
   sick man of europe outside eu with the slowest economic growth  fastest growing economy inside eu `` we do n't need them '' rofl , go actually look at the history of britain pre and post eu instead of lieing through your teeth . 
  ni is a long shot . 
  most reasons for leaving are moronic or downright misinformation . 
  in the uk , right and left both want free/cheap college , housing , healthcare , water , electricity and other social subsidies . 
  you are comparing the politically backwater hell hole of american politics to one of the most successfully ran social welfare infrastructures in the world because you have no idea how the real world works . 
  catalonia , brittany , and other seccessionist areas of europe could see scotland leaving uk and joining eu as their queue to mobilize for independance . 
  thats not how democracy works ** now ** . 
  thats civil war talk m8 . 
  how dare you reply to me you dirty leftist !, 
  * am i doing it right ?
