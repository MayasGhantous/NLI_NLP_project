  all other religions combined ? 
  `` islamaphobe '' attacks ? 
  look , i 've no problem with the people . 
  i 've a problem with their religion , and it seems they have a problem with their religion too . 
  we ca n't ignore the elephant in the room of islamic religious violence . 
  they kill more people in weeks than lives claimed in 26 years of sectarian conflict in northern ireland . 
  i do n't know what the solution is , but if we ca n't talk about the problem with islam without people saying `` not all muslims '' or `` racists ! '', 
  we 're never going to be free from the problem . 
  we ** know ** that not every single muslim in existences supports violence , but the ones who do cite their religion as a justification . 
  edit : but yeah this is n't really the place for this conversatiom imo . 
  this is about foosball . 
  why do so many polish lads have shaved/bald heads in ireland . 
  its like a signal flag for polish men so they can find each other in a crowd if shit goes bad ? 
  follow the shiny light for slavic solidarity ? 
  i want to say 50 % + of the polish guys i 've worked with were bald/shaved heads . 
  they practice getting tear gassed . 
  its normal fair for people who regularly see riot police . 
  do you think people at riots just happened to have scarves and masks to cover their faces ? 
  its planned . 
  anyone who takes the actions of a few areseholes and applies them to all english or brits for that matter is a cunt imo . 
  referencing a 12 year old joke from a movie is being a dick because the joke is relevant to current news ? 
  i 've been getting videos sent from friends over in france . 
  couple of them have english fans knocking seven shades of shite out of each other in the background . 
  it does n't mean anything . 
  they 're just a few wankers ruining the atmosphere for others . 
  ah now here , if you 're going to take a video used as a joke like that so personally we 're going to have to remove your banter license .

  ethnicity is more than just being white or black or slav . 
  ethnicity literally just means belonging to a social group with national/cultural ties/traditions . 
  irish people belong to an ethnicity , by the definition of ethnicity . 
  some other examples of ethnic nationalism : catalonia , scotland , kurdistan , brittany . 
  ethnic nationalism does n't necessarily mean they are recially focused . 
  its just irish people saying `` we want our own country '' or scottish people saying `` we want independance '' and so on etc. 
  ethnic , in ethnic nationalism simply refers that the nation should be drawn on ethnic lines . 
  the french have france , the germans have germany , the poles have poland . 
  that was pan-slavic nationalism . 
  there are many different forms of nationalism . 
  ethnic nationalism ( ireland , poland ) , civic nationalism ( america , revolutionary france ) , religious nationalism ( israel ) , territorial nationalism ( america `` i was born here and i love my country '' ) , pan-nationalism ( yugoslav , german empire ) , anti-colonial nationalism ( most of the world outside europe ) , integral nationalism ( fascism ) , left wing nationalism ( usually associated with national liberation : see sinn fein ireland , fidel castro cuba . 
  also loosely associated with communism and socialism ), 
  thats because it fudges the numbers . 
  the same company who conducted this poll 5 days ago said that 52 % vote to remain , 40 % to leave and 8 % undecided . 
  even when you account for people who are not planning to vote its 47 % remain , 46 % leave with 5 % do n't know . 
  its most likely , pretty closely split around the 45-50 % mark with a slight edge to the remain , which is why sometimes samples give out numbers like 40-50 % due to the sample size of 800 out of 64m with vast regional and local level differences based on geography even within a single city limit . 
  i 'm suprised ireland is still a net beneficiary of eu funds , considering our relatively wealthy status in eu . 
  it seems so easy to say that when we have enjoyed peace and prosperity for so long , but there are people alive today who lived during the wars , and there were of course the wars in yugoslavia , and so on . 
  i think dismissing the possibility of war is arrogance and hubris . 
  even people in 1910 beleived a war was impossible because the world was too connected and trade too important for the economy . 
  i think we know how that story ends . 
  australia has a lot of camels . 
  where do you think they learn their manners ? 
  i 'm not here to make statements one way or another . 
  i just drew up the numbers for people to draw their own conclusions . 
  irish state pensions vary from $ 150 to $ 430 based on contributions to prsi , and whether you worked in the public/private sector . 
  a claimed adult currently gets $ 188/week , unclaimed adult gets $ 122/week a fully disabled child gets $ 30/week . 
  ( maximum rates ) so yes disabled adults would lose out between 60 % -45 % of their income . 
  well . 
  right now the child benefit in ireland is $ 140/month/child ( you get $ 210 per child for twins , $ 280 for triplets and higher ) so they would actually see an increase to $ 375 per month per child regardless of twin/triplet status . 
  unemployed people eligible for jobseekers allowance ( near impossible to get atm if you 're under 24 but i 'll talk about that another day ) is $ 100 - $ 126/week for under and over 24 respectively . 
  they would be paid $ 86/week so they would lose out . 
  people on state pensions would also lose out by 50-10 % depending on their pension level . 
  i 'm not advocating for or against bi , just ran the numbers for people to get an idea . 
  it would n't cover every expense without an increase . 
  i 'm not advocating for or against basic income , i estimate it would have to be at least 7,500-10 ,000 per year to cover basic living costs for most people . 
  i just ran the numbers against the current spending to illustrate what could be done with the current level of funding . 
  child benefit in ireland right now is $ 140/child/month . 
  so people with children are getting 37 % of the benefits they would if they were paid $ 4,500 per child . 
  under basic income . 
  the numbers change if you have twins or triplets . 
  unemployed people would see their benefits cut by 16-35 % depending on age . 
  if you siphoned off even half the money from the 0.5 million children and gave it to adults , that gap would close to 9 % -30 % ish while still leaving people claiming for children 30 % better off . 
  there are ways to move the numbers around to make them more optimal to minimize the impact . 
  but it would be an upheaval i predict . 
  you could also do stage by stage roll outs . 
  start just by cutting out child welfare entirely and replacing it with basic income for people under the age of 18 . 
  the numbers would be the same and you have the system ready to be tweaked and rolled out . 
  you could then cut out the dole , and incorporate people who are n't working into the basic income scheme while cutting all the costs associated with administration . 
  then you could roll the pension into the scheme , as well as disability . 
  i do n't know if it could work but i 'm just spitballing ideas . 
  presumably if we kept the tax rates the same , high income earners could only be getting 60 % of the benefit ( roughly ) meaning even though their on paper income is up 4,500 it only actually cost the state 2,700 . 
  i 'll have to do a full effort post later for / r/futurism and / r/europe using ireland as an example country to give people a better idea of the numbers involved . 
  thats not what i said . 
  i gave a `` what if '' scenario . 
  it was merely to illustrate that the numbers can be moved around to make savings and shift where the money is applied . 
  so example , childrens parents could be paid 80 % of the childs wage while 20 % remains in some sort of fund for when the chuild enters adulthood . 
  again , not saying this is what should be done , but what can be done . 
  well , the social welfare budget in ireland was $ 20,800,000,000 ( 21billion [ 17 % gnp ] ) in 2010 . 
  if that were just given evenly to every person ( incld . 
  children from birth for arguments sake ) in the form of basic income it would come out to 20,800,000,000 / 4,595,000 = 4,526 . 
  you could round it down to 4,500 and save $ 122,227,000 . 
  that would be $ 86 per week per person , retired , baby or adult . 
  consider that jobseekers allowance is $ 100 - $ 126 a week depending on age . 
  consider now that it was only paid to people over the age of 20 . 
  in 2010 13.6 % of the population was under the age of 20 . 
  that would bring the eligible population to 3,970,000 . 
  assuming you kept the 4,500 figure , the total social welfare budget would drop to 17,865,360,000 or 86 % of the original welfare budget in 2010 . 
  you could actually pay every adult on the country over the age of 20 $ 5,000 per year and still be saving money . 
  are these numbers useful ? 
  maybe . 
  consider minimum wage is $ 16,600 . 
  there would also be substantial savings from the staffing and running of these welfare offices , since its simplified to everyone just getting a share of the pot .
