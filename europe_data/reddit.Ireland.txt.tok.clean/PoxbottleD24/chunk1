and there is ham in the sandwich i 'm eating . 
  they did n't . 
  there were protestants in the ira . 
  because this video would belong in that sub . 
  that 's it . 
  literally . 
  if the company owner had dropped his jocks and put a pen up his arse , i might link r/buttsharpies , despite not being a fan of it 's content . 
  yes ... ? 
  this is at the heart of my argument . 
  ireland is a capitalist land , with many socialist ideals . 
  i 'm guessing socialist means tyranny to you . 
  to us , those men liberated us from tyranny . 
  i can respect for their idealism , while being the big capitalist bastard that i am . 
  understand yet ? 
   socialism is not same as full blown communism that fucked over my country and family . 
  - / u/drebutis also , that 's not defending socialism . 
  also ( still ) not a socialist . 
  keep up bud .

  also not a socialist either ( still ) . 
  keep up bud . 
  where exactly ? 
  oh , are we making things up about one another ? 
  i love this game !, 
  / u/debutis loves hitler . 
  great craic , this . 
  yeah , i know , which makes your original post all the more misplaced . 
  i 've not argued in favour of communism , or socialism . 
  thanks bud , you too . 
  as a guy from a state founded by socialists , fuck yourself right back , 
  no ... as in like , literally nobody cares . 
  nobody cares pal . 
  ah but nobody has heard of that sub . 
  brilliant . 
  ah it 's a shitehole alright , it still fits this video though . 
  read again : deals with * much more * than the means of production . 
  read a bit more on the subject bud . 
  socialistic policies are implemented in every country . 
  you ca n't boil capitalism down to 2 sentences either . 
  you realise that the modern concept of socialism deals with * much * more than the `` means of production '' , right ? 
  you keep harping on about it . 
  your biting on a line without bait , bud . 
  did you recently lose an internet argument or something ? 
  i 'm sorry for offending you mr. finnish man , i should n't have linked to that sub without considering your feelings on socialism . 
  i beat my wife to increase her productivity in the household !, 
  so ... just like most subs ? 
  off your high horse mate , it 's a fitting post . 
  nobody is forcing you to click on the link . 
  [ yes it was . 
  an ancient civilization used it . ], 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germania#/media/file:imperium_romanum_germania.png ), 
  it 's `` only a geographical term '' bud . 
  clearly there 's a reason to throw the central european nations under one name . 
  why not greater germania ? 
  i wouldnt expect someone from greater germania like yourself to understand . 
  hahaha it 's not an annexation . 
  east germany * was absorbed * by an eu state . 
  ni * wo n't be absorbed * by the irish republic . 
  see the difference ? 
  the unionists up north would take up arms . 
  or maybe it 's exactly the same and the leader of ireland passed this clause for the craic . 
  sure is n't he a gas cunt altogether ? 
   i 'm fully aware of the gfa but it 's not relevant here ... you 're aware of it 's existence . 
  you realise it also provides the framework for a potential irish reunification , right ? 
  it 's ** absolutely ** relevant . 
   the eu law ... not in dispute with east germany ... read above . 
  east germany = / = ni . 
  roi simply `` swallowing '' ni will * never * happen . 
   the only way ni being annexed ... lol . 
  look up the definition of annexation . 
  ni is no longer an eu land , as it was when the gfa was written . 
  this clause guarantees that the eu will accept the newly formed irish land . 
  * your * government made this necessary . 
  i 'm just unsure at where i should even begin . 
  had you any knowledge of the gfa , you would n't have written such a ridiculous string of sentences . 
   he 's entirely corect legaly this 'll be fun ... 
  mind explaining how ? 
   kenny was just being petty to score points at home . 
  this happened at the end of april , and was kept quiet until it would n't negatively effect may . 
  yep , sounds * just like * point scoring . 
  lol at everything you just wrote . 
  and we can disregard the rest , as it 's either incorrect , or it does n't in any way apply to ni . 
  that 's a nice couple of paragraphs there , but it displays a clear lack of knowledge on ni and ireland . 
  you ca n't take what you know of the reunification of germany and just apply it elsewhere . 
  there 's one key difference between east germany and ni : * unionists * . 
  if the majority of east germans had wanted to stay in east germany , * they would n't have needed * barbed wire and landmines . 
  reunification would n't have happened . 
  generally , the irish republic and it 's politicians absolutely want reunification , while the north is split along tribal lines . 
  many have taken up arms both for , and against this . 
  the situation is ** not ** the same . 
  that 's why this clause was needed . 
  or maybe these women are just as capable as their male coworkers ... ? 
  you fail to see a difference because you know nothing of the situation in the north . 
  literally none of what you said would happen . 
  the fuck are you shiting on about ?
