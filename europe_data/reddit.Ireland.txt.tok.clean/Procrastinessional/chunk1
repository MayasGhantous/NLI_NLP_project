it 's a semi-state afaik like bord gais or bus eireann or whatever . 
  so prices are set by a regulatory body but they get to keep their profits and have access to the national coffers too, 
  the same can be said for ireland , althought the initial uprising was 1916 we did n't secede until 1922 and it was 1949 before we became a republic, 
  slovakia looks incredible , you guys get overshadowed by croatia as a destination i think , which seems surprising now . 
  old town tallinn , saaremaa , and estonian women would have to be the top 3 for a start, 
  definitely belongs in / r/fellowkids, 
  not really why it started , it began to allow free trade between central european nations so they could stop fighting over resources and start making money . 
  it worked . 
  since then it has grown with apparently no clear end goal in mind . 
  today , some nations want a us of e , some want loose trade agreements , and some want hefty agricultural grants and nothing more . 
  oh i see , really i just wanted to know what the flag meant . 
  the hover text says something unrelated , google was useless , and you kept assuming i had some basic knowledge of the context . 
  thanks for taking the time to answer though, 
  it was like trying to get blood from a stone above . 
  and what is the context ? 
  what does the flag represent and why would people downvote because of it ? 
  what does it represent ? 
  and what does `` alayiniza ! '', 
  mean ? 
  google tells me nothing . . 
  it 's from [ a reddit post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/204rbe/yes_this_is_a_student_dormitory_and_yes_there_are/ ) a while back , [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/vkntn ) is the album . 
  it 's for real * and * it 's the very worst part of macedonia . 
  from a [ comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27crwe/voting_percentage_in_volgograd_1237_new_record_in/chzoyj6 ) further down  we had the same kind of thing [ in estonia on the 25th ] ( http://i.imgur.com/anx8wvm.jpg ) . 
  apparently , the elections website calculated support figures incorrectly , as the number of total votes lagged several update cycles behind the number of votes cast for a candidate . 
  all broadcasters , including the highly-regarded public broadcaster , circulated the so clearly incorrect figures throughout the evening . 
   this says more about the media than it does about the potential election fraud . 
  the only food pyramid i 'll ever recognise is the one on my plate made entirely of mashed potato and butter . 
  i do n't know to be honest , that 's why i asked . 
  i do n't remember it being a big thing . 
  there was mass and eggs and that was it, 
  aside from the p\u00e5skmust you could copy-paste this comment for any event in the swedish calendar . 
  midsommars , jul , birthdays , name-days , sundays . 
  i 'm not complaining by the way , janssons frestelse is the shit . 
  schnapps - i could do without though, 
  do we really do anything for easter , meal-wise that is ? 
  i saw an ad on tv last night where some fucking supermarket was trying to convince us that easter is celebrated like christmas . 
  `` feed the whole family this easter with a ham for only ... roast potatoes at only ... 
  etc. '', 
  as far as i can remember it was always just a bunch of chocolate eggs and then lunch and dinner as normal . 
  were my family just hethens ? 
  we 've had ... * mixed ... * experiences with letting the clergy look after our kids , i would n't recommend it . 
  we do n't have a good record in africa i 'm sure . 
  was it during wwii ? 
  what country was this ? 
  are those figures correct ? 
  they exceed 100 % . 
  i ca n't check your source because i do n't understand icelandic i 'm afraid, 
  we had a similar situation in ireland when the [ ira blew up nelson 's column in dublin ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/a_half-demolished_nelsons_pillar_on_oconnell_street%2c_dublin.jpg ) . 
  the irish army came to demolish the stump and in doing so caused more damage than the original bombing, 
  i see the '' . comp '' now . 
  well spotted, 
  the link you posted is broken, 
  german ? 
  that 's a great one , i 've never heard it before, 
  not my native language , but the swedish word for areola is beautifully ugly . 
  a nipple is a * br\u00f6stv\u00e5rt * ( breast wart ) and the areola is * v\u00e5rtg\u00e5rd * ( wart garden ), 
  i 've never heard this one before . 
  beautiful phrase, 
  there 's a bunch of the heavier ones at the bottom of the irish sea , depleted uranium 235 for example, 
  did we really not get * any * ? 
  even under british rule ? 
  edit : [ 1661 : modern chemistry founded by robert boyle with the publication of the sceptical chymist ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_irish_inventions_and_discoveries#17th_century ) - i think we can claim them all now, 
  i 'm not good with the labels but i thought fox were neo-cons no ? 
  the best thing they ever did to discourage support for the bnp was to put nick griffin on a tv debate . 
  by forcing extremists further underground it allows them to go unchallenged and they become more and more dangerous, 
   during the boom years iceland was run more like a hedge fund than a sovereign nation . 
  its three main banks accumulated assets from around the globe that at its height ** equaled around 10 times the nation 's total annual economic output , or gdp ** . 
  so if they collapse it could be more like a $ 170 billion ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ whatever ^ ^ ^ 10x ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ gdp ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ 2007 ^ ^ ^ was hole in the ground ? 
  highest population ? 
  seriously though , i love germany . 
  i do n't know if i would say it 's my favourite but it would be in the top 3 countries i would like to live in . 
  it has a nice balance of liberty and social responsibility , with a healthily modest view of itself imo, 
  straight irish guy here , i lived in sweden for a couple of years and i felt like a feckin troll there . 
  they have normal , and even ugly people too but their good-looking people are like gods . 
  the guys are tall and handsome , the women are beautiful and slender . 
  ^ ^ ... not ^ ^ to ^ ^ generalize ^ ^ or ^ ^ anything ... 
  what would you have said to someone who asked that when you moved out of your parents ' house ? 
  it 's being discussed widely but i do n't imagine too much will come of it . 
  i really doubt he will resign . 
  just to put this in context , they are voting on whether doctors will be able to terminate a pregnancy in very narrowly defined circumstances , without facing criminal charges . 
  even if it passes both houses fully you will not be able to get a termination unless your life is at risk be it suicide or otherwise . 
  women 's rights here have a long way to come . 
  i think most people here are just embarrassed . 
  between the bankers tapes , antiquated abortion legislation , and the continuing catholic church scandals our reputation in europe is mud , and now we have this ... 
  i do n't know if that 's better or worse tbh . 
  it seems really unprofessional to me . 
  one of the mps accidentally voted against his own party on this same bill . 
  i wonder had he been in the bar too, 
  do other parliaments in europe have a bar in them or is it just us ? 
  i think that is the real disgrace here , they are paid by us to work not drink and horseplay . 
  is there any other profession where drinking on the job would be acceptable ? 
  also , have a look at this related article from our [ satirical newspaper ] ( http://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2013/07/11/aine-collins-td-now-pregnant-by-tom-barry-and-seeks-abortion-2/ ), 
  ~ ~ you used a vat rate of 20 % , it says [ here ] ( http://www.vatlive.com/vat-rates/european-vat-rates/eu-vat-rates/ ) that it is 25 % ~ ~ apologies , you were right . 
  my mistake, 
  thanks , not sure how i made that mistake . 
  here in ireland we get screwed when we buy stuff from uk shops based here . 
  their euro prices are vastly increased probably to cover themselves in case of currency fluctuations, 
  all prices in euro at current exchange rates ---------- s - 97,44 dk - ~ ~ 66,91 ~ ~ 80.32 f - 89,90 nl/b/a - 79,95 d - 69,95, 
  there was a really good piece on rte radio 1 this week where they recounted this story : in one estate they had built the bonfire much too close to the houses so residents , too scared to confront those who built it , complained anonymously to the psni . 
  the psni also not wanting to appear to take sides didi n't get involved instead the council promised new kitchens for everyone on the estate if they moved the fire .
