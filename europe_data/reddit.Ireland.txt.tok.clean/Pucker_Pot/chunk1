goddamn denmark making the rest of us look bad . 
  this sounds a lot higher than i would 've expected . 
  i thought we were in the range of 1-3 % year-on-year growth . 
  edit : [ more details ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/irish-economy-now-growing-at-its-fastest-rate-in-seven-years-1.1933398 ) . 
  gnp growth is even larger ( 9 % ) . 
  i 'm confused though , as someone is quoted :  mr mac coille said gdp growth of at least 4 per cent was likely for the year as a whole and that if gdp was flat for the second half of the year , 5 per cent growth would not be out of the question . 
  was there an unexpected dip in june last year that 's skewing the number ? 
  even still , 4 % gdp growth seems way ahead of schedule . 
  from looking into it seems the difference is down to a drop in income ( gni per capita ) . 
  most other factors remained the same or slightly increased ( health , education ) .

  british crossover of the flash + captain america . 
  i agree . 
  i 've only noticed it in threads that reference either russia or certain ethnic groups ( i.e. 
  roma ) ... but then half of the posts from / r/europe on my front page this month are about putin . 
  regardless of the fact that putin is a dickhole or that referendums should take months not days to plan , most of the top posts lately are either image macros or biased/inaccurate news headlines . 
  in the threads themselves there is n't much room for a discussion or a russian point of view which is n't self-effacing and/or unreservedly anti-putin . 
  i read supposedly pro-western news organisations ( bbc , guardian , ny times etc. ), 
  and i think i learn something about the russian position , but on here i do n't really get to see much at all from the russian side . 
  well this seemed inevitable . 
  guardian comments are routinely awful and subject to comment `` brigading '' ( particularly ever since its us readership grew from 2008 onwards ) where articles , usually in the comment is free section , get linked from elsewhere . 
  some clear examples i can remember were when conservative websites like the drudge report or breitbart would link to articles advocating gun control or universal healthcare or withdrawing troops from iraq/afghanistan . 
  but the main problem with the guardian comments is the archaic voting/sorting system . 
  the ny times allows comments to be voted up and also has `` editors ' picks '' . 
  whereas on the guardian website comments appear chronologically . 
  so comments near the top are almost always reactionary responses , often written by trolls , who have n't even read the article . 
  sometimes nonsense comments appear as soon as an article is posted , and they remain the first thing every subsequent reader sees even if hundreds of others respond and tens of thousands read the article , which frames many subsequent comments in a certain way . 
  if they used a more up to date commenting system ( where users voted useful comments to the top ) the quality of discourse would be soooooo much better & astroturfing would be less effective . 
  when did `` whataboutism '' replace the word `` whataboutery '' ? 
  they both mean the same thing , right ? 
  i mean , sure the russian government might be involved in astroturfing , but what about this blatant subversion of language ? 
  yep , the dictatorial decree of a monarch that 's been dead for hundreds of years is on ** you ** !!, 
  also the map is incredibly fragmented in belgium compared to other countries . 
  i 'm sure if you had the same breakup of regions in the uk then the areas encompassing london/birmingham/glasgow might be be dark blue . 
  i have pay-as-you-go sim cards for ireland/us/uk . 
  i think the proof of address is lax in some countries ( i.e. 
  you sign up in the store , write down an apparent address , and walk out with your sim card + new phone number ) . 
  if you 're referring to the telephony network : the quote indicates that the price of calls & data will be the same in every country ( using an irish phone in germany is subject to the same data/call charges as an irish phone in ireland ) , the effective price should be the same . 
  although i guess providers will still be able to charge more for intra-national calls , which means using my irish phone in germany to call german phones will cost more . 
  but if i use my german phone in ireland to call a german phone ... 
  i should really just stick to using skype . 
  sweeeeeet . 
  does this also mean more competition / a fully european market ? 
  is it likely i 'll be able to sign up to a french provider if i live in ireland ? 
  ( i.e. 
  i can have a french mobile number ? 
  thanks !, 
  any thoughts on these numbers ? 
  i assumed that nato 's airforce would 've remained the same size rather than be reduced 50 % . 
  ( give that nato now includes more countries , modern conventional wars are often asymmetric & the side with the best airforce is superior etc. ) . 
  i 'd also previously read that the us + russia had somewhere between 1500 and 3000 nukes each , which was roughly half the number when nuclear disarmament began . 
  maybe that referred to specific `` nukes '' ? 
  ( i.e. 
  icbms ) . 
  yes , i do n't think the total number of warheads made much tactical sense . 
  both sides were locked in an irrational `` arms race '' , so whoever had the most weapons was winning . 
  nuclear weapons were also constantly being upgraded ( bigger , safer , better delivery systems etc. 
  ) , so older weapons were simply stockpiled , and - as far as i know - it 's only in the past 10-15 years that both sides have really got down to dismantling many of these older warheads . 
  i also recall that china [ bought huge tracts ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/10332007/china-to-rent-five-per-cent-of-ukraine.html ) of land in ukraine in recent years ( aka the bread basket of europe ) as a preemptive means of securing farmland/food sources in the coming decades . 
  on the other hand , the distance involved seems odd for a country as far away as japan ( but i guess wheat products do n't spoil easily/can be shipped large distances over long periods ? 
  not disagreeing with your argument , but the `` leave the ukraine '' was more nuanced than that . 
  iirc it was about reverting to greater autonomy in crimea , which it had briefly in 1994-1995 . 
  i 'm especially interested in the nuclear power question as i personally agree with the green party ( s ) on many issues but not typically its stance on nuclear power . 
  she did mention concern about nuclear subsidies in another answer :  [ figures from the commission show that subsidies for renewables are much lower than current subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20q04q/i_am_member_of_the_european_parliament_margrete/cg5nmib ), 
  it 's odd to me that belarus , probably russia 's staunchest ally , apparently has the smallest russian population . 
  apart from assad , i think lukashenko is likely to be the next well-known dictator to fall or be replaced ( in the coming years ) . 
  russia at least has a ( debatedly flawed ) democratic system , whereas belarus really is the last dictatorship in europe . 
  while russia has crackdowns on dissidents & the opposition , much of it happens in view of the public and is at least reported on in some russian media ; in belarus , the opposition gets disappeared or tossed in jail on election day . 
  strongman regimes ca n't survive in an era of satellite tv & internet unless you go full hog like north korea & intern/murder hundreds of thousands of people , or employ a modicum of liberalism like russia with coordinated dark arts for media manipulation . 
  numbers matter - they 're somewhat proportional to the wider level of support a movement has . 
  this camera angle implies there is a full-scale rally happening ( the impression i had upon seeing it ) , but it does n't show the empty spaces behind & to the side of that line of people . 
  a primary way that media images mislead are not what they show but what they omit . 
  just the other day people on / r/europe were criticising closely cropped/framed photos of a few dozen russian protestors holding a giant flag : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zcpxq/thousands_of_crimeans_manifest_holding_a_big/cfsks0b, 
  and on the topic of gards , this happened too : [ case of garda who drank whiskey to ` steady nerves ' after knocking down young girl is dismissed ] ( http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/case-of-garda-who-drank-whiskey-to-steady-nerves-after-knocking-down-young-girl-is-dismissed-30044545.html ) after reversing over the outside his house , the gard left the scene without reporting the accident after the parents left to take the girl to hospital . 
  he eventually returned to his house after the gir 's father tried to find him . 
  one gard interviewed him , left , and came back with two others and he was breathalysed and found to be over the limit . 
  it 's a very desperate move though . 
  crimea is the most pro-russian of any region , and if its 2.3 m people are no longer part of ukraine , voting for the likes of yanukovych , it 's even more likely that ukraine will turn west in future elections and be lost to russia .

  someone should write a steampunk novel about this . 
  there was a [ beautiful monument ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nelson%27s_pillar ) in o'connell street for lord nelson , a british admiral who died in the battle of trafalgar . 
  it was blown up by former ira members during the 1960s . 
  edit : there was also a statue of queen victoria that was removed & put in storage in the 1940s , and a few other statues that were blown up . 
  funny comparing these to the lenin statues being pulled down : [ we either bombed our british statues ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statues_in_dublin#list_of_past_dublin_statues_and_monuments ) , or carefully took them down for preservation .

  you are n't really helping your argument . 
  ok now do congo . 
  ditto ; traveled to all of these countries ( albeit northern rather than southern france ) and never saw a sign like this . 
  heres is a quick comparison : ( op 's abc image , op 's original image , one of your abc images ) http://i.imgur.com/mulddbx.png while the eyebrows are n't curved in your image , it is very generous to suggest this is merely an accidental result of general touching-up . 
  edit : i am curious about the ops pic though , since it does n't have the yellow tag in the version from twitter that someone posted as a possible source ( the extra curling on the eyebrows is mising too ) : https://twitter.com/ppopulista/status/421054523394641920, 
  i 'm confused , the photos in the pages you linked are photoshopped too ? 
  there might be minor differences ( halo around soldier 's head ) , but the touching-up is still visible ( black eyebrows draw in , pale skin , brighter red jumper etc.
