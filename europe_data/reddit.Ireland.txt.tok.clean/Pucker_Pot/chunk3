  - neil postman, 
  `` teenage virgin nerds '' - yeah you sound like a paragon of maturity . 
  i think there 's a good bit of truth in what / u/mike _ blomkvist said though . 
  many iraqi soldiers did flee confrontations and isis captured huge amounts of equipment as a result . 
   the isis fleet of captured u.s. military vehicles , including m1a1 tanks , grew by more than 100 when iraqi security forces ( isf ) fled the provincial capital of ** ramadi ** 60 miles west of baghdad and abandoned their equipment , pentagon officials said tuesday . 
   photos posted by isis on social media purported to show about 10 m1a1 abrams tanks in their possession and large amounts of captured ammunition . 
  http://www.military.com/daily-news/2015/05/20/isis-captures-hundreds-of-us-vehicles-and-tanks-in-ramadi-from-i.html  isis captured $ 1b in american humvees in iraq , uses them in suicide bombing  according to agence france-presse , al-abadi admitted the loss in an interview on state tv . 
  `` in the collapse of ** mosul ** , we lost a lot of weapons , '' he said . 
  `` we lost 2,300 humvees in mosul alone . ''  the humvees were lost when isis forces overran mosul last year , forcing iraqi soldiers to abandon tons of equipment during their retreat from the city . 
  http://www.mintpressnews.com/isis-captured-1b-in-american-humvees-in-iraq-uses-them-in-suicide-bombing/206167/ lack of training seemed to be an issue , but one of the aspects i remember reading about last year was down to sectarian differences between the government and the army . 
  basically : some sunni officers/soldiers in the army did n't want to fight for the shia-led government against sunni militants , so they dropped their weapons and fled rather than fight . 
   a group of military deserters have painted a devastating picture of the ability of the iraqi army to stand and fight , telling the telegraph how entire divisions surrendered mosul , iraq 's second city , without firing a single shot . 
   speaking from the kurdish city of erbil , the defectors accused their officers of cowardice and betrayal , saying generals in mosul `` handed over '' the city over to sunni insurgents , with whom they shared sectarian and historical ties . 
   corporal muammer naser , 35 , told the telegraph that his superiors had sympathised with remnants of the regime of saddam hussein , and that the generals essentially passed control of the city to them . 
  organised militias of saddam sympathisers are said to have participated in the takeover of mosul and saddam 's birthplace tikrit , this week . 
  cpl naser said : `` the war now is definitely sectarian . 
  in mosul , the sunni soldiers did n't want to fight against the sunni insurgents . '', 
  this is seriously concerning . 
  tl ; dr the article strongly implies that russian intelligence plotted to assassinate montenegro 's prime minister and carry out a coup because that country 's government would n't give russia access to a mediterranean port and is attempting to join nato . 
  [ you sent a few thousand troops to help irish rebels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_kinsale#spanish_landing ) , occupied irish towns in the sw of the country . 
  generally speaking a good thing ; although sometimes i wonder if we 'd have ended up speaking spanish if it had been successful , 
  i think populism is a bad route to go down . 
  personally , i think the main cause of brexit & trump is low-information voters . 
  people who rely on tv news , eschew broadsheet newspapers , join facebook groups that peddle extremely partisan narratives or outright conspiracy theories . 
  most european countries thankfully have public service broadcasting , but even the bbc were n't able to stem the tide of outright lies and myths circulated in the run up to the uk referendum . 
  nobody can agree on the facts anymore and left wing populism does n't help that . 
  ireland is thankfully free of right wing populism/nativism , but the form of left-wing populism we have here is not without its problems . 
  sanders lost the popular vote to clinton in the primaries and polled worse among black voters . 
  he was popular on reddit , but given that obama - a centrist - lost his majority in a landslide in the 2010 midterms to a republican party that branded him a socialist , i do n't see how you can claim that a self-avowed democratic socialist would have played well with american voters . 
  he could n't even win among left-leaning voters . 
  that idea is good in theory but laughable in practice . 
  britain is stuck with a centre-right government until 2020 . 
  america just handed the totality of its government and judiciary over to people who want to slash public spending , cripple the tax base with higher income tax cuts , and empower corporations with constitutional rights . 
  france is about to elect a centre-right president . 
  the left is more divided than ever . 
  income inequality is about to get a lot worse before it gets better . 
   538 was regularly shit upon because of that beside the point , but this really grinds my gears . 
  538 wrote multiple articles about how high uncertainty was , how poor the average quality of polling was compared to 2012 , how trump had an unusually high chance of losing the popular vote but winning the electoral college . 
  pollsters who put trump at between 1-10 % criticised nate silver for not being empirical ; democrats shit upon him for chasing clicks because every poll said it was a sure thing . 
  and now after the result people are slating them because the model did n't predict a trump win ( their model had trump at 2/1 just a few days before the election , which was way , way more favourable than any other model ) . 
  bernie sanders really was n't popular though ( apart from on reddit ) ; he lost the popular vote to clinton , and it 's patently obvious how deeply unpopular clinton is . 
  `` muh white privilege '' - i hope they 're american ... 
  `` the left '' regularly criticises islamism . 
  in what way ? 
  protecting us from the french/germans ? 
  there was no invasion of libya or `` completely leveling the place '' . 
  nato 's actions were almost entirely limited to bombing gaddafi 's army . 
  i 'd dispute the notion that we 're reliant on the armies of other countries . 
  the only countries that have ever invaded or threatened to invade us are our neighbours - the uk , spain , france , germany . 
  we do n't need an army to fight off a potential british invasion . 
  oh , i was way off . 
  sorry , you 're right ; that is tiny . 
  ~ ~ that still works out to at least $ 3-400bn , which is n't bad considering canada is a relatively average-sized country . 
  the current euro zone growth rate is something like 1.6 % , so adding 0.3 to that just by increasing trade with one country ( whose economy is tiny compared to china , the us , and the eu ) is n't so bad . ~ ~ http://i.imgur.com/sahc9x6.gif, 
   not even the usual tv politicians in the talk shows were discussing it in any detail . 
  wait , you have tv shows that discuss eu-wide political issues ? 
  if individual referendums across all member states were required nothing would ever pass . 
  you would always get at least one shock result due to protest votes against unpopular incumbent governments , or smaller nations holding the rest hostage over populist issues . 
  only a single pan-eu referendum would work for passing treaties like that , but that would be much less fairer as it would only cater to a majority of the eu population ( which might be fewer than 10 countries ) rather than respecting the sovereignty/interests of all countries . 
  infants . 
  though this would n't account for 6 % either unless it counts 3-4 year olds as non-speakers . 
  i doubt the number of immigrants that ca n't speak english is even 1 % of the population . 
  i have met immigrants who had limited english , but i 've never met one who could n't carry on a conversation at all . 
  then again , i doubt that they sampled 1000 people and tested their conversational english skills . 
  it 's probably self-reported and 6 % of people put down non-english-speaker for the craic . 
  of the major right-wing leaders in europe over the years ( sarkozy , berlusconi , cameron , and even blair ) -- merkel seems pretty ok and is more of a centrist if anything , though i think her finance minister ( all of his various comments in the media re : greece & ireland over the years ) has been pretty retrograde . 
  of course , [ we 're also looking at centre-right governments in britain , france , spain ( ? 
  ) , ireland , poland etc.

  whataboutism about whataboutism . 
  it literally is . 
  `` russia did a bad thing ! '', 
  `` yeah but what about america ? '', 
   the uk covers 13 % of the sea in the eu , but ** was allocated 30 % of it 's total quota ** . 
  so you 'd have to catch more on less sea . 
  really ? 
  that does n't sound right.this indicates that they caught ~ 13 % of the total catch in eu countries last year . 
  ( interestingly norway 's haul is 3x larger ) . 
  you are correct though in that the uk may not necessarily have free run of its own stocks :  [ countries such as norway have this 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone in place , they also have agreements with a number of countries , and with the eu to allow fishing in those waters . 
  ] ( https://fullfact.org/europe/eu-pinching-our-fish/ ), 
  glad i saw this comment first in the thread . 
  bit too late to stop the usual / r/europe narrative in the rest of the comments , though . 
  utter nonsense . 
  how do you manage to even dress yourself ? 
  haha it 's actually not nonsensical . 
  ireland has a deeply unpopular water company called `` irish water '' , so presumably people are searching to find out what `` scottish water '' do differently . 
  many of the people who try to travel to the uk have english as a second language , relatives there , and/or come from a former british colony . 
  also the number of immigrants that enter the uk is far lower than france and so there 's generally more opportunity for them to find unskilled work . 
  there are tonnes of people in this thread saying let them drown . 
  the eu is n't a superstate , changes to it have been incremental and each treaty was passed by parliament . 
  i had n't realised it actually went default . 
  that explains a lot ... 
  technically another referendum would be the tiebreaker ( uk held a referendum in the 1970s to join the eu which passed with a two-thirds majority ) . 
  i read up a little more on this : it seems apple have [ colossal amounts of cash overseas ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-22/tim-cook-s-181-billion-headache-apple-s-cash-held-overseas ) which has been effectively untaxed and ca n't be repatriated to the us without apple paying the difference between the us tax rate ( 35 % ) and ireland 's < 1 % rate :  under current law , u.s. companies owe the full 35 percent corporate tax rate -- the highest of any industrialized nation - - on income they earn around the world . 
  they receive tax credits for payments to foreign governments , and have to pay the u.s. the difference only when they bring the money home . 
  presumably apple and the us government will eventually come to a deal or possibly even an amnesty on repatriating this money .
