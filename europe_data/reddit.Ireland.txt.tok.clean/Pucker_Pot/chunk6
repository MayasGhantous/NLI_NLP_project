  ** using the post-rebate figure , it 's more accurate to say the uk sends # 35 million a day to the eu . 
  yes ? 
  that is a huge difference . 
  the uk receives a rebate because of a special deal negotiated in the 80s that means it pays less per capita than many other countries . 
  and it ignores the fact that half of that money gets sent back to the uk . 
  those laws are n't just imposed on you ; your mep and your pm can still vote against them , and for most important things you have a veto ( like taxation , foreign policy ) . 
  the eu could be more `` democratic '' , but that would probably mean even more integration and an elected executive/president , which would weaken the ability of individual states to reject legislation . 
  neither of those outcomes are anywhere near likely . 
  there is a realistic chance of scotland choosing to go the independent route , but the only way ni would split from the uk is as an independent country and that is at least a generation away from being feasible ( huge budget deficit , power-sharing coalition government among two groups that hate each other and is only kept in check by outside forces etc. 
   christian right-wingers are not nearly as prone to violence against gays . 
  they are less so now in countries where homosexuality has been decriminalised and/or gay marriage has been passed , but violence against gays ( `` gay bashing '' ) used to be far more common and accepted in western countries ; we 're barely one generation removed from that . 
  for example in dublin , in the 80s , a man was beaten to death by teenagers in a park and the people responsible were given suspended sentences despite being convicted . 
  people in their neighbourhood actually cheered when news got around that they 'd been let off . 
  generally , being gay in ireland throughout the 20th century was not a thing you did openly in working class areas unless you wanted to get the shit knocked out of you . 
  because ukranian security forces have an agenda and this statement ( implying russia was supporting a terrorist attack on france ) has n't been corroborated :  however , french police sources told afp news agency that ukrainian officials had yet to send them any details . 
  there was some scepticism that the suspect could have been anything more than an arms trafficker . 
  yeah , there have been very rapid changes between the 1980s and 2000s . 
  my catholic secondary school went from having many christian brothers ( religious lunatics who beat children ) to 0 religiously-minded teachers in that timespan . 
  the `` religion '' class i had spent more time discussing * other religions * and social issues like poverty rather than catholic doctrine . 
  of course i can only speak to my school ( which has since closed & merged w / an educate together school ) . 
  also the ussr ( and by extension warsaw pact countries , maybe ? ), 
  was pretty big on teaching evolution . 
  though initially they taught an alternate version :  lysenko 's theory rejected mendelian inheritance , the concept of the `` gene '' and departed from darwinian evolutionary theory by rejecting natural selection . 
  [ 3 ] proponents falsely claimed to have discovered , among many other things , that rye could transform into wheat and wheat into barley , that weeds spontaneously transmute into food grains , and that `` natural cooperation '' was observed in nature as opposed to `` natural selection '' . 
  [ 3 ] lysenkoism promised extraordinary advances in breeding and agriculture that never came about . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lysenkoism not to mention many other fields were [ suppressed or limited by political expediency ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suppressed_research_in_the_soviet_union ) . 
  but in general they promoted a pro-science , naturalistic ( i.e. 
  humans and life in general came about due to natural forces rather than divine/spiritual ones ) view of the world . 
  tbh it 's often the case that half our team is born in the uk , but only two of the current starting 11 ( mccarthy & walters ) were born outside ireland . 
  they have an alert on their phone that pings every time someone mentions `` british isles '' on reddit . 
  yeah , i 've heard newfoundlanders with stronger accents than a fair few irish people . 
  the french champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence , but there is a california champagne by paul masson , inspired by that same french excellence . 
  it 's fermented in the bottle and , like the best champagne , it 's vintage-dated . 
  tea in ireland & the uk is blended to go with milk . 
  it tastes pretty bad without it . 
  bookend either end with a few more soldiers bayonetting armenians and kurds and it might be more accurate . 
   where were the fucking rallies before the vote ? 
  [ there were rallies before the vote ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/14/brexit-vote-campaigns-intensify-as-rallies-planned-across-uk ) . 
  the rest of your post is entirely uninformed . 
  there has been an ongoing debate about what exactly brexit will mean ( hard brexit vs. soft brexit , eea membership , single market , freedom of movement , etc. 
  etc. ) . 
  the government has indicated they want a hard brexit and are willing to accept disastrous wto trade rules if they do n't get the deal they want ( no free movement ) ; these protesters are advocating for a soft brexit . 
  youtube conspiracy theory channels and reddit comments ; where else ? 
   you have freedom of movement with all of the countries that will accept them in without you having a say in it . 
  there is no freedom of movement for non-eu citizens to the uk or ireland - that 's not how any of this works . 
  almost a year later and you still do n't get it . 
  striking a chord generally means that you agree with someone/echo their feelings . 
  are you sure english is your first language ? 
  amazon hosts servers for pretty much everything . 
  thank you . 
   just like how hundreds of millions of dollars are ` donated ' to the clinton foundation ( a charity ) , because it 's not officially being donated to the campaign/party . 
  the clinton foundation does n't spend money on american elections , so no , it 's not like that at all . 
  very questionable sources and claims made in that first link ( which is an `` irish '' pro-life pressure group that receives money from ... you guessed it ... the america pro-life lobby ) . 
   not at all . 
   there was very little substantive discussion of the recent wikileaks releases by us media there was extensive coverage in quality broadsheets ( nyt , wsj , wapo ) of salient parts of those releases where new information was made available . 
  and , in fact , i remember seeing a great deal of criticism towards the new york times and other newspapers , following the election results , for spending too much time covering those leaked stories ( many of which were engineered by the fsb and russian military intelligence ) , to which nyt writers/editors replied that it was necessary for balance . 
   it 's a shame , because other than wikileaks , what else is there to ensure that the ruling class still has to fear someone airing their systemic corruption ? 
  newspapers ? 
  snowden 's leaks took place without using an independent mediator ( the guardian & glenn greenwald ) . 
  the pentagon papers were published by the new york times . 
  the washington post broke watergate . 
  nevermind the multiple similar organisations to wikileaks giving whistelblowers an outlet ( e.g. 
  the panama papers ) . 
  there might be another [ reason why wikileaks was critical of the panama papers ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/panama-papers-money-hidden-offshore ) . 
  nor a french president having an affair . 
  france is about the last country in the world that would give a shit about any of that . 
  what ? 
  that 's the opposite of what i said . 
  also a weak currency over a long period is not necessarily a bad thing . 
  other countries have repeatedly [ criticised china for its practice of * artificially * keeping its currency low ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=usd&amp;to=cny&amp;view=10y ) in order to boost trade . 
  but this conspiracy theorist works in finance , so what do we know ? 
  yeah , that comparison was totally useless . 
  italy is behind almost every country in the eu 15 ( pre-2003 accession treaty ) [ in terms of gdp per capita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_gdp_\\ ( nominal \\ ) _ per_capita ) ; and it does about as badly or worse on things like unemployment , income inequality , and government debt as any other country in the euro zone . 
  i ca n't wait till donald tries to visit ireland or scotland ; will be great craic, 
  it 's the same on virtually every thread on this sub to do with refugees . 
  normal people get tired of debating them , so they just ignore these threads ( which i should 've done instead of scrolling halfway through these shitty comments ) . 
  probably because of the many people he had executed or assassinated , or those killed by terrorist groups that he supported . 
  well also because she led her party to victory in multiple elections . 
  virtually every comment of yours in this thread is picking random nonsensical fights with other people . 
  chill . 
  what like vikings landing in norfolk ? 
  when is the next seldon crisis anyway ? 
  four days you say ? 
  because when a major terrorist attack happens , it 's normal ( everywhere in the world , including schengen countries ) to add extra checks in chokepoints like train stations . 
  france applied temporary controls when terrorist suspects were on the run . 
  traveled by train from france to turin and then on to milan , where to police who stopped him askef him for id . 
  will reflect poorly on german police if it turns out that he just hopped on a train out of berlin . 
  somewhere a body bag is being zipped open from the inside . 
  yes , and part of the uncertainty mentioned in one of the statements was the question of whether or not there were accomplices :  after berlin police expressed doubt about whether they had in fact detained the right man , mr frank , the country 's public prosecutor general , said : `` currently we do n't know whether it was one or several perpetrators . 
  `` we currently do n't know whether he or they had support . '', 
  berlin police chief klaus kandt said it was possible that there was a `` dangerous criminal on the loose '' and he urged vigilance . 
  i 'm really not sure what you 're saying . 
  you 're blaming political correctness for terrorism ? 
  if the media were more inflammatory , less violence would occur ? 
  islamic state and its precursor have consistently attacked shia mosques and religious gatherings . 
  the australian solution is a total disaster that causes needless suffering among people fleeing persecution and has separated families . 
  uh , you 're the only person `` name calling '' in this discussion . 
  your second paragraph has almost nothing to do with the person you replied to . 
  three people being ambushed in public by a man with a rifle is local news ? 
  how about you lose your attitude , jeez .
