  it was just as easy for them to present the fascists in chile in 1973 as a small fringe force or just a misrepresented group who are really looking for western liberalism and they would repeat those events in a heartbeat given the chance and i fear many here do n't realize this . 
  to use a crude example what you ask is like a creationist asking a scientist to present evidence that god did n't create the world 6000 years ago , what evidence is he supposed to show in that case ? 
  oh look here look its the universe , here 's fossils , here 's star distances . 
  everything he presents can be dismissed as simply as some magic trick from god , he planted the fossils , he faked the starlight so on . 
  and in the same way your argument can dismiss any evidence as caused by `` culture '' , this is the circular argument problem and this is why this is an issue can only be criticized properly in ideological terms because it is very much rooted in ideology . 
  the question is on the basis of social analysis , you above use `` culture '' as a defining factor in the social relations of nations whereas i reject that and see it simply as a product of material relations as has been the praxis in most sociological study since marx , any evidence you propose to present this is going to be at best arbitrary and distracting from the actual point of the debate as it will simply run into circular reasoning as it is a question of inter-related causation that when in the context of complex societal functions can not be empirically tested to any satisfactory degree to warrant any use in debate . 
  so no its not that i `` do n't want '' to present evidence its that i reject any practical use of evidence in this area as necessary given its ability to be easily dismissed by both sides , for that matter for all your talk on it i 've seen no evidence from you who made the proposition to begin with . 
  its not an insult its an ideological accusation responding to an idealistic proposition that can not be refuted by evidence by its very nature , we 're talking about a base conflict in ontological approach that can only be addressed in ideological terms . 
  can we stop using this subreddit as a shitty propaganda base ? 
  the fascists in the ukraine are a very real and a very dangerous contingency , they 're by no means a legitimate excuse for putin 's actions but they 're not something we should be mockingly dismissing . 
  yeah we still have n't quite come to terms with this after a history of poverty . 
  oh look a nordic talking about how they 're not doing better because of their material conditions but they 're rich because they are better , replace `` culture '' with race and its the same old fascist shit . 
  well tis the season afterall . 
  because its totally in line with their actions thus far and the material basis predicating their relation between russia and ukraine . 
  for that matter i am more trusting of leaked documents than official statements . 
  when politicians say `` for now '' in this context it practically always means never , its a meaningless rhetorical device you 're clutching to . 
  the same thing was said about colonialism , the fact is as much as western powers have always come in with this pretense the result is more often than not supporting a very authoritarian leader who promises stability and freedom of commerce and not much else , because this is really all they care about in the end of the day , we seen it with countless cases from pinochet to gadaffi and if the ukranians are not careful we 'll easily see it again there . 
  even putin himself is very much in part a product of western support from fears of the still extremely powerful communist party coming to power . 
  i totally agree with your concerns here but i do not see where they contradict the referendum , if there is no vote held then who decides if crimea will or will not leave , russia ? 
  ukraine ? 
  you see the issue , it is unclear whether crimeans do want to leave and both sides present a completely different picture of their persuation based on their material interests , a vote is the only fair way available to represent the true interests of crimea . 
  furthermore it is my inclination to believe they do not wish to by the very fact russia is invading rather than waiting for the referendum and propagating false imagry to present fictional support movements for them . 
  but perhaps they do despite this and that is why a vote is essential . 
  place restrictions on the ability of russian elite to do business here , putin 's entire regime revolves around juggling between pleasing the oligarchs while suppressing leftist dissent , by doing so putin will be strongly pressured by this rich class to relent actions , we would obviously take an economic burden too but the balance of trade is highly disproportionately stacked against russia . 
  most of us would be willing to take this burden i wager but our own elite class are not and ukraine is not worth the political clout our politicians will take from this privaledged and money obsessed few if they did take what only amounts to a small financial sacrifice . 
  as to the crimean people a referendum has already been arranged , if they truly wish to join russia , which well may be the case , let them vote in an independantly overseen process , until then even if they do unaminously support the annexation any military action to simply take crimea is completely illegitimate violation of a nation 's sovereignty based only on flimsy claims of ethnic russian persecution which can clearly be seen to be at the very least grossly exagerated by the russian government and propaganda . 
  ukraine is going through an on going political crisis , there very much is real far right contingencies expressing anti-russian and anti-jew aspirations that we can not ignore and the ukranian governments unconstitutional expulsion of yanukovnych was a frantic and foolish effort to relieve the protests in the same manner as mubarak in egypt that ultimately simply undermined what was already a functional democracy that will further destabilize the discourse in the nation . 
  with all this in mind however imperial interference from the west or russia will escalate tensions not relieve them in any way and the actions by putin will undoubtably act as a massive boost for fascist support that we in the west are dangerously ignoring through a concerted effort to overlook it in our media . 
  [ i made this point earlier , ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zft0g/russia_gives_ukrainian_forces_in_crimea_ultimatum/cftgntq ) people need to realise the western leaders are not ukraine 's ally they 're just another powerful force interested in exploiting them , same as russia only they go about it in a softer way , and if that exploitation costs more than their dealings with russia then they will leave ukraine abandoned as nothing more than a business expense . 
  this is not the european solidarity we should strive for , this is a club of pragmatic elitists who would rather sellout a nation to protect only profits then allow us the citizens the choice of taking the necessary sacrifice to help our eastern brethren . 
  well of course they did n't they have n't even entered crimea , it must have been that pesky unknown army . 
  a better question is why we are talking about `` we '' here , we the vast majority of people in western europe are all firmly opposed to russian aggression and would be willing to take an economic hit to oppose their imperialism but we are not control of our countries , the people who are in countries are far more cushy with putin and his rich allies than they would like to admit . 
  no i 'm saying if they wanted to use it to clean the mattresses as / u/reinaldog said , no idea if they would but they easily could . 
  tell that to mexico . 
  you say that but all we 've seen of late is nato aggressing other countries while just wagging a finger at russia . 
  to hell with these third reich comparisons , its classic russian empire . 
  still seems terribly rudimentary in this day and age , does anyone have another source of this sort of tactic being advised ? 
  not necessarily though . 
  yes i absolutely agree and i scoff at people falling into straight into merkel 's vindications of putin but in either case i 'm simply concerned at an approach to nuclear weapons which asserts that they 're use could never occur due to m.a.d. 
  ( quite an acronym now that you mention it ... ) . 
  this is the thing people need to realize : ** the leaders in western europe and the us are not against russia ** not in the proper sense , they do n't approve of russia 's actions sure but in the end of the day they trade and make money and make calculated risks , russian oligarchs , allies of putin , live in expensive apartments not in moscow but in london and paris and send their kids to private schools in germany and switzerland , what does the ukraine have to offer against these interests ? 
  thats the only question they ask here . 
  if the ukraine is deemed to be not valuable enough to assist it wont be assisted and thats the end of a matter , a united europe should be one which is one for all and all for one not a pack of miscreant elite run opportunists who will cut one of our prospective members loose because of fear of losing profits . 
  this dangerously assumes rational actors . 
  it could function as a defensive pact rather than in any projecting force , or be arranged in such a way to be versatile in the composition of consenting nations . 
  and of course in other areas of combat like the airforce which is n't as soldier intensive . 
  rt pls go, 
  [ for reference 16 people did in fact die while building it . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palace_of_culture_and_science#history ), 
  hey you should be more appreciative , do you realize how many good men died being forced to make that by the soviets . . ? 
  absolutely , western media pulls tricks like these all the time though they 're often more subtle about it , you have to be checking multiple sources to get close to the full picture , unfortunately many in russia only have access to , by choice or circumstance , the heavily censored broadcast media thus they 're able to get away with stuff like this far easier . 
  because he only cares about pretending to his own people , and at that only a section of his own people who buy into the heavily censored broadcast media and not those who will go online to see pictorial analyses of weapon models . 
  keep in mind only around half of russian people have any access to internet and only a fraction of them will actually use it to see shit like this . 
  and the system predates the one used in english for that matter . 
  so do i , but its going to be an issue sooner or later , europe ca n't and does n't have to be this reliant on a single energy source . 
  at the same time you have to remember russia is far more reliant on the eu for its trade than vice versa . 
  nah you exaggerate the importance , there 'd be a big hit to bear alright but its not something we could n't get around and we 've had bigger shortages in the past . 
  i do n't understand your logic here , the us cares far more about its relationship with russia than the ukraine , yes they would rather the ukraine belong to the west but they would let the entire nation be carpet bombed if it meant keeping the resource flow coming in from russia . 
  its all about money , its not because the us do n't have a spine its because they weigh up the costs and benefits and rule the ukraine is expendable . 
  this is exactly what the eu was meant to be set up for , in a world in which we 're pulled between two aggressive and greedy superpowers the eu was to look out for our own interests and not to be played like pokerchips between those two , yet people have forgotten this since the cold war ended and act as if america is some sort of benevolent force looking out to protect us , fuck this attitude we have to protect ourselves . 
  i like that they recoloured putin 's clothes into an african style . 
  [ importantly when compared with this posted below . 
  ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bhvn0vjcqaanseu.jpg ), 
  thats the point they 'll go in to enforce matriarchy and convert all the polish children into homosexuals like putin has been warning us all along . 
  how trustworthy are deterrents against the sort of arsenal russia has ? 
  exactly , legality has long been thrown out the window in this crisis . 
  they speak against austerity in the first paragraph but make no promises to end it , only commenting on the matter :  austerity ** - only ** policy has harmed our economies and punished those least responsible for causing the crisis note the - only , they 'll carry on the same process of cutbacks while lauding about pseudo-keynesian promises they wont follow up on , some `` socialists '' they are . 
  that may not be a good comparison though for a number of reasons as the cost of labour in russia is a lot cheaper , there tends to be huge redundancies in spending between multiple small nations and they have a shit ton of military infrastructure most of europe lacks . 
  snake was right war has changed ... 
  as long as russia retains the world 's largest nuclear stockpile i imagine the preferred route would be to support states under siege rather than direct confrontation , as had been the established strategy throughout the cold war , unfortunately this means that states most vulnerable to russia 's reach may be hopeless . 
  importantly i believe this policy of russification extended long before the ussr during the russian empire too . 
   24 sep 2013 ... 
  world war iii , get to the shelters before they 're packed . 
  ## \\  `` democracy '', 
  the un security council seat alone puts russia ahead of japan and india in my view , while the other two are powerful nations they do n't have the international reach russia exerts . 
  but if a pound union is impossible do you think they would prefer the euro over a scottish currency ? 
  this is why all democracies need the power of instant recall . 
  the point is though the soviets killed simply because they felt it necessary to hold control over its subjects while the nazis was nothing short of pure extermination as a goal in of itself , madness is not simply madness here they are of a very different nature and thats why the soviets never killed 17 % of your countrymen , however bad they were i have no clue how you can argue they were just as bad as a force that set out to totally anihilate entire peoples . 
  its in everything about the two , the scope of time and population the regimes took place in , the way in which the killings occurred , the intent of the killings , the targets of the killings , certainly you see the difference between gassing a six year old girl because she comes from a certain ethnic group and shooting a 40 year old man for dissenting against your authoritarian rule , both are horrible but one is certainly worse and of a different nature than the other in my eyes at least . 
  of course both regimes acted terribly and unjustifiably but that does n't mean it is legitimate to say they were just as bad , the british during the same period killed many every year in the empire but no one , i included , would lump them in the same category for the reasons i mention above . 
  what where i said they `` wantonly killed political dissidents , demanded hegemonic control of all association and crushed whatever liberties it felt the need '' ? 
  give me a break , apperantly anything short of calling them literally hitler is defending them . 
  oh fuck off , i seen this exact accusation coming because its so bloody typical , i remind you i aint the one who started these comparisons i was just responding to them , yeah i agree it is totally distasteful to be drawing parallels between the two regimes and its that exact concept that has been used in propaganda for a long time and i find it repugnant . 
  and thank goodness it was n't the other way around or i dare say there would n't be a poland today . 
  again i 'm not defending the soviet state i 'm critcizing this ridiculous notion that their rule was comparable to nazi germany 's , the soviets may have wantonly killed political dissidents , demanded hegemonic control of all association and crushed whatever liberties it felt the need but the nazi 's done all this turned up to eleven and quite literally exterminated nearly a fifth of the nation 's population in some of the most barbaric conditions mankind has ever witnessed . 
  furthermore this whole notion that they are at all comparable is simply an overhanging propaganda technique from the us during the cold war that lives on in a very dangerous form today . 
  hah well for that matter victoria did n't really do anything wrong . 
  she did n't really do anything in general mind ... 
  six million people were exterminated in poland in just around five years , only half of those were jewish , for all the unjust soviet political executions this is an ant to a gorilla . 
  trying to compare the two regimes as the same to me is just a butchery of history and i question it to be a highly ideologically motivated phenomenon . 
  we could always just replace her head with merkel 's . 
  we actually did have many such statues that we torn down after independance , [ nelson 's pillar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nelson's_pillar ) being the most famous example and i fully support eastern europeans choosing to do the same with their own statues . 
  my only gripe here was implying that the ussr were no better than nazi occupation , and even with the decisions of its imperialist leaders those russian soldiers believed they were fighting to free europe not conquer it . 
  this would go to ignore that the polish actually were occupied from a force that was pumping millions of their citizens into death camps , as bad as the ussr were to simplify this as moving from one tyranny to another is absurd . 
  damn thats actually a pretty nice statue , on `` loan '' you say ... 
  yeah i 'm by no means not proud about knowing them but on the discussion of educating the world on poland its important . 
  there 's always a chance though , 30 % is nothing to be scoffed at 7 months before an election but i certainly would n't bet on it . 
  the problem is children in poorer areas tend to have far less direction from parents due to far more single parent households , parents working long hours and parents who are themselves ignorant or uncaring about the problems with the consumption of bad food . 
  so while all children know that certain foods are unhealthy , although i 'd wager most kids are unaware sodas contribute to weight gain , there is a certain amount of parental reinforcement that is required to ensure they follow the healthier lifestyle which does not occur in poorer areas despite income and education not being a direct factor to this ends . 
  sorry to say i never heard of those first two names ...
