if the vast majority of northern ireland suddenly says that they want a united ireland , and a majority here wishes for the same thing , i will welcome them with open arms , despite my misgivings . 
  but as it stands , that is not the case . 
  there is no overwhelming push for unification and we are in no shape to accept them even if there was . 
  our economy has suffered and we are not equipped to deal with the costs that would come with unification . 
  besides that , both the north and the republic have their own unique set of issues and i do n't think either side is keen on adopting the others . 
  the dream of a united ireland is nothing but sentimentality at this point . 
   to my knowledge we were never at war with ireland nope , quite the opposite actually . 
  france rebelled against british rule with us a few times . 
  in [ 1796 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exp%c3%a9dition_d%27irlande ) and [ 1798 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_rebellion_of_1798 ) both failed , but we did give it a try , so thanks !, 
  i do n't want to sound cold or anything , but i think your overestimating how much people care about israel here . 
  the antics of the embassy are usually what brings the issue to the forefront , as well as heightened tensions such as the past summer , of course . 
  i 'm struggling to find a better phrasing than `` tbh the average person does n't give a fuck , '' but it probably captures the mindset / and i can tell you here and now that nothing of israeli-palestinian history is taught in primary schools . 
  you make it sound as though our children are being force-fed propaganda . 
  like i said , the average person does n't concern themselves with israel 's business . 
  there are of course hardcore nationalists who do draw parallels between ireland-england and israel-palestine , but they are very much a minority . 
  they 'd be more of an issue in northern ireland ( though still a tiny minority ) where you 'd also find some strong israel supporters . 
  [ reeling in the years ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reeling_in_the_years ), 
  the anglicanization of many irish place names has led to some very odd locations . 
  cill in irish means churchyard but it was anglicized as kill or kil , so there are places called [ kill ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kill,_county_kildare ) , [ killbrittain ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kilbrittain ) and [ kilkenny ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kilkenny ) ( so many south park jokes whenever it 's mentioned online ) other than that , there are places called [ muff ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muff,_county_donegal ) ( slang for vagina . 
  muff 's diving club is popular ) , [ effin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/effin ) and [ bastardstown ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yeaozs2.png ) there are plenty more , and i 'm sure someone else will come along with some great ones, 
  it does makes sense . 
  it 's an irish language name , so it adheres to its pronunciation rules . 
  do you mean s\u00e9amus ? 
  yes , it 's a fairly common name here . 
  we do not say `` top ' o the mornin to ye '' here in ireland . 
  yes, 
  well there are worse countries to be ruled over by i suppose , i 'll allow it . 
  i 've always heard ` the back arse of no where ', 
  our top three guesses for your english dialect : 1 . 
  south african 2 . 
  north irish ( uk ) 3 . 
  canadian our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language : 1 . 
  english 2 . 
  dutch 3 . 
  swedish well , it did n't get the dialect right , but i suppose the north is close ? 
  it guessed my native language correctly , though, 
  no mention of icelandic ? 
  it 's my personal favourite, 
  it was put to a public vote actually , and ireland 's favourite painting is [ hellelil and hildebrand , the meeting on the turret stairs ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tivw3hr.jpg ) by frederic william burton * this richly coloured watercolour painting depicts the ill-fated lovers hellelil and hildebrand , meeting on the stone stairway of a medieval tower . 
  the princess and her bodyguard had fallen in love but her father regarded the young soldier as an unsuitable match for his daughter and ordered his sons to kill him . 
  the painting captures the couple 's poignant final embrace . 
  burton was inspired by the story of the ill-fated lovers told in an old danish ballad . 
  * though i suppose ireland 's most famous artist is probably francis bacon . 
  you forgot the most important picture of [ michael d ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sixjk41.jpg ), 
  norway is `` iorua '' in irish , and red squirrel in irish is `` iora rua , '' i do n't think that there is a connection in the naming , but i remember noticing the similarities as a child and concluding the norway must have lots of squirrels, 
  in the irish language it 's known as `` an \u00cdsilt\u00edr , '' which literally translates to `` the low country '', 
  an interesting one i was taught in school , `` mallacht chromail ort '' - the curse of cromwell upon you . 
  i 've heard of [ gr\u00e1inne n\u00ed mh\u00e1ille ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grace_o'malley ) being used to represent ireland . 
  i 'm quite fond of a lady pirate representing us , and i like the idea of a real person as a personification . 
  another is [ kathleen ni houlihan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kathleen_ni_houlihan ), 
  nice of him to ask if we wanted that ... 
   the stereotype is that you are hard working but claim unemployment benefit under a different name . 
  i 'm totally unfamiliar with this stereotype . 
  in fact i 'd say the prevailing opinion is that poles are hardworking . 
  when i sing our national anthem i 'm reminded of what an awful singer i am  but i like the song , some people complain that it 's a bit too militaristic , but it 's a product of its time . 
  i 'm fulfilling the potato stereotype here but i ate a bowl of leftover mashed potatoes about an hour ago, 
  * `` is mise warch agus is as an r\u00edocht aontaithe dom . 
  '' * which means * `` i 'm warch and i 'm from the united kingdom . 
  '' * in case you wanted to know anything other than how to get to the loo , 
  ** is there a big movement to revive your old language ? 
  ** a lot of people are passionate about it and there are also a lot of people who see it as a pointless waste of money and effort . 
  it 's a mandatory school subject and there are schools where you are taught entirely through irish . 
  ( i went to irish schools and now i 'm fluent , there are a lot of complaints about how the language is taught in english speaking schools , which are the majority ) we have bilingual signs , irish language radio , television , sections of certain newspapers are in irish . 
  i do n't see irish dying but it 'll never thrive and it will never rival english ** is ireland truly all green ? 
  ** most of the time , yes . 
  my grass faded a little this may/early june with the lack of rain . 
  it was still green , it just was n't that emerald colour anymore . 
  18 was my best, 
  i was n't trying to claim anyone either way , i was going off a list, 
  4 out of 10 nobel prizes were for literature , the others were for peace ( 5 wins ) and physics ( 1 win ), 
  i have no idea what i want to do with my life , but it 's not so bad because i 'm happy and healthy and that 's what matters most . 
  excommunication is pretty rare i think , i do n't think they punish any ordinary person that way . 
  i 've been looking at the [ wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_people_excommunicated_by_the_roman_catholic_church#21st_century ) for people who 've been excommunicated this century and they all seem to be priests or nuns . 
  i remember reading that the current pope excommunicated mafia members recently , but i think that 's as far outside the clergy they extend . 
  then again , you probably would n't hear about any average joe off the street getting kicked out of a religion , would you ? 
  i could attempt getting out of the church by telling them of my love of the same sex and of clothes of mixed fabrics , but i think all it would do is make the priest feel awkward . 
  excommunication is a pretty drastic step anyway , i 'll stick to avoiding religion and ticking the ` no religion ' box each census, 
  i honestly had no idea whether or not it was , and after a quick google it appears so . 
  i found [ this article ] ( http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/features/its-my-sacred-right-to-leave-the-catholic-church-282576.html ) by a man who wanted to leave the church and he made contact with the department of justice , who said ;  `` the state has no role in determining the rules and regulation of different religious denominations , including the canon law of the roman catholic church . 
  all citizens are equal before the law of the state , regardless of religious affiliation or non-religious affiliation . '', 
  so it seems the government does n't really care , as we 're only considered part of the church by the church itself and not the state . 
  thankfully we do n't have anything like germany 's church tax which would make this situation a whole lot worse . 
  still , it would be nice if we could leave and literally set the record straight . 
  [ 12,000 people ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/count-me-out-closes-because-of-catholic-church-defection-system-chage-1028259-aug2013/ ) left the catholic church here but the catholic church abolished parts of canon law which then made formally defecting impossible . 
  i was n't aware of how much it rains in switzerland, 
  there 's quite a bit of cloud cover today so i 'm fairly comfortable . 
  the temperature has n't been too high lately , but it 's the humidity that annoys you , and according to google , it was 94 % humidity the other morning . 
  i 'm very grateful that we 're not reaching mainland uk temperatures though . 
  it turns out i have a name day !, 
  well this is cool , it 's like discovering you have a second birthday, 
  i got numbers , 4 , 6 , 7 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 14 , and 15 correct . 
  i 'm fairly happy with my result , it could have been a lot worse . 
  i ca n't find a source other than wikipedia itself but it says  in modern irish and scottish gaelic the word for `` blue '' is gorm ( whence the name cairngorm mountains derives ) -- a borrowing of the now obsolete early welsh word gwrm , meaning `` dark blue '' or `` dusky '' . 
  a relic of the original meaning ( `` dusky '' ) survives in the irish term daoine gorma , meaning `` black people '' . 
  nobody 's acted angrily , they 've all been pretty gracious in their defeat . 
  it 's a pity they could n't have been kinder during the run up . 
  it 's actually difficult to find pale foundation at your average chemist or department store outside a city . 
  i have to buy mine online . 
  well i do n't drink wine so i do n't intend on buying their product , but that does n't mean i ca n't enjoy the ad . 
  just because something is intended as advertising , does n't forbid it from standing alone as a piece of entertainment .
