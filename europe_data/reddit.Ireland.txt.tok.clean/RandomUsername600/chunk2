  ca n't i just be touched by people being nice to each other, 
  this is heartwarming . 
  i could n't understand a word of it but it was touching nonetheless, 
  i think the waste of resources claim is fair enough point , depending on where exactly the money is going and how much is being spent . 
  perhaps not everything needs to be translated into irish , i do n't personally need it , but i 've grown accustomed to everything being labelled bilingually , read aloud in both languages ect . 
  there are greater wastes of money and resources though . 
  but i have to disagree with your nationalism claim . 
  i really dislike the idea that tends to circulate that people who care about the irish language are diehard shinners or are desperate for a united ireland . 
  i am neither yet irish is important to me . 
  it 's a language not a political view first and foremost . 
  i 've grown up speaking it . 
  i began learning at three so it 's a part of me . 
  is it any different from a french speaker valuing their language , a polish speaker caring about polish ? 
  whether you consider it important to you or not , irish is a part of our culture , just as things like gaa , works literature , music are . 
  is it equally nationalistic to value those parts of irishness for what they are ? 
  i really do n't know the truth to that claim about gaelscoileanna though . 
  i 've heard it said many times over the years but really could n't tell you the facts behind it . 
  i personally feel attending a gaelscoil/chol \u00e1iste was beneficial to my learning , but it 's definitely not for everyone . 
  why ? 
  what 's the harm in it surviving ? 
  i do n't know if proud is the right word to describe how i feel , but i am grateful . 
  i 'm thankful that i was born somewhere safe , stable , and free . 
  that goes for both being european and being irish . 
  i think angela merkel gets some blame too, 
  english and irish fluently . 
  i took german briefly in school , but i do n't remember much and am far from being fluent, 
  i 'm fond of this song in irish from [ metal gear solid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywgvrxjokw8 ),

  a six month sentence for stealing $ 4 worth of food was far too harsh in my view , glad to see this outcome, 
  there are so many bland entries again this year , and now we 're losing this ? 
  [ the spice bag ] ( http://www.just-eat.ie/blog/irelands-favourite-dish-national-takeaway-awards-2015/ ) was voted the nations favourite takeaway dish . 
  it 's chicken , chips , ( sometimes veg - usually peppers ) and unknown spices the [ 3 in 1 ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?rlz=1c1savs_enie542ie542&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=3+in+1+chinese&amp;revid=1441042830&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi2_fb66zdmahub1iwkhwhab40q1qiigw ) is also popular , which is chips , rice , and curry sauce . 
  i do n't know if anyone currently has this surname , but there 's a figure in irish mythology called [ fionn mac cumhaill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fionn_mac_cumhaill ) , whose surname is sometimes anglicized as ** maccool ** , which totally sounds like a name you 'd give the hero in a cheesy action film . 
  the subreddit is looking great !, 
  a true honour to the motherland , well done , comrade, 
   since being the first country to introduce a full smoking ban in 2004 , ireland has prided itself on being a pioneer of lifestyle regulation a smoking ban in public places , the wording makes it seem like it 's illegal . 
   in the meantime , it can boast of the world 's highest taxes on alcohol and tobacco in the world . 
  the only eu member states with higher taxes on alcohol are the uk and finland . 
   that 's so awkwardly worded and contradicts itself . 
  trick or treating was part of the original festivities too , it was all about collecting offerings for the dead . 
  halloween * is * european . 
  it 's a celtic thing , not american, 
  far-right parties have n't been successful or been much of an issue here in ireland . 
  personally i 'm not in favour of reunification , i do n't see how it could benefit roi . 
  [ here 's an \\ ( incomplete list \\ ) of terrorist incidents in the eu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrorism_in_the_european_union#terrestrial ) for people wondering about certain spikes and the unnamed others it seems as though it does n't include incidents from before a country joined the eu, 
  you 're right , he 's naomh p\u00e1draig , 
  i personally know many . 
  i know people who would label themselves catholic ( mainly if someone asked ) but would n't call themselves religious , or say they believe in god . 
  i suppose for some people , these things are more cultural labels ( or tradition ) than anything else . 
  we use the [ single transferable vote ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_transferable_vote ) system so it takes a while to sort out . 
  for anyone who is n't familiar with the process ; you number your candidates by preference ( as many as you 'd like , 1 being favourite ) and then they must reach a threshold to be elected . 
  if a candidate does reach the threshold , the excess votes are redistributed . 
  when candidates fail to reach the threshold and there are positions still to be filled , then the candidate ( s ) with the least amount of votes are eliminated and then the votes are redistributed . 
  you end up having a lot of counts so it takes time , and there are loads of candidate running in some places too . 
  21 in one constituency . 
  edit : [ cgp grey has a video on it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8xozjkozfi ) , and explains it better than me,

   i know nothing about irish politics ( probably quite ignorant due to their proximity to us ) but good luck to the good guys !, 
  whichever party they are  it 's ok , i do n't know which party they are either , 
  i 've never had to wait when going to vote , it 's always seemed well organized to me and i 'm in and out quick enough . 
  that said , i tend to vote early in the day .
