  it would give an orphaned child a home , it 's cheaper , it does not inconvenience a woman who wo n't be able to raise the child and the world is already overpopulated . 
  but as long as nobody is getting screwed over , i 'm okay with surrogacy . 
  after all , lots of people have genetic kids naturally . 
  why does it suddenly become problematic if the parents want help ? 
  i 'm most likely never gon na have kids , but if i do decide to have them , i 'll adopt . 
  edit : i spelled embryo wrong . 
  fixed it . 
  never heard of any ridiculous movement until i was on reddit . 
  so there 's probably no such movement in here . 
  thank god . 
  ireland has been in the top ten in the last few years . 
  it once even came fifth . 
  i have seen a lot of gender equality of line , but i mostly attribute it to living in a progressive side of the country . 
  the truth is , whenever you see ads about childcare , you can expect to here `` mum '' or `` mam '' , but the word `` dad '' rarely seems to come up unless it 's for comedic effect . 
  those advertisers live in this reality bubble of their own where there is no such thing as a stay-at-home dad . 
  you could argue that we get a lot of british ads , but the irish ads are just as bad . 
  there 's no paid paternity leave for public employees . 
  the fathers get only a few days off while the mothers can get up to six months off . 
  women dominate careers related to childcare . 
  creshes , primary schools , you got it !, 
  you 're more likely to see a woman working there . 
  you 'd only ever hear of a male babysitter if he 's the older brother of the kids being babysat . 
  whenever a student misbehaves in school , the teachers demand to speak to or get a note signed by the mother ( father only if he 's the only caregiver ) . 
  textbooks about human geography rarely mention anything about fathers . 
  outside of parenthood or childcare , most , if not , all of the positions in construction are held by men . 
  most of the people in the military are men . 
  discussions on sexual harassment or sexual violence only talk about female victims and male perpetrators . 
  there are some idiots who mentally think that a woman would never hurt someone and all that other shit . 
  ironically , a woman is more likely to be slut-shamed than a man . 
  i 'd say we are far behind on gender equality . 
  i 'm convinced that countries like the netherlands , new zealand , australia , france and germany outrank us . 
  i feel we 've only been ranked so high because for 21 straight years we 've had a female president and because our most famous boxer is a woman . 
  i know we 're better than a lot of countries in terms of gender equality , but this report is just a load of shite . 
  we do have them , and we love them . 
  but we also like british chocolate . 
  i had no idea how disliked british chocolate is worldwide . 
  i guess we have weird tastes . 
  edit : oh well ... more cadbury 's for me . 
  thank you kind sir !, 
  we 'd never admit it , but we do love you guys . 
  we consider you guys to be more like rivals like anything else . 
  we think of you guys the same way canadians think of americans . 
   and , i 'll admit , father ted is more irish than it is british . 
  while that is most definitely true , the show was broadcasted through channel 4 , so you guys definitely deserve some credit . 
  a neighbour told me a lot of the indoor filming was done in london as well . 
  well they 're very popular over here in ireland . 
  people have different tastes , but we do love your chocolate . 
  then again , a lot of cadbury 's chocolate that is consumed in ireland is made in ireland . 
  but even the cadbury 's chocolate made in britain that we get is just as good . 
  and in return , we gave you guys immigrants , traditional irish music , halloween ( yep , that came from us  ) , graham norton ( though you did give us the graham norton show in return ) , oscar wilde and guinness . 
  we also gave you guys jedward . 
  our mistake . 
  ** britain : ** you gave the world harry potter , james bond , doctor who , the beatles and trainspotting . 
  you have produced some of the funniest shows on the planet like mr bean and fawlty towers . 
  you make some of the best chocolate in the world . 
  no joke ; 90 % of the chocolate my parents have is cadbury 's , the rest being thornton 's and terry 's , all british brands . 
  you showed ireland the world . 
  you showed the world the world . 
  and as a bonus , you 've managed to scare justin bieber away . 
  props for that . 
  ** spain : ** you provide one of the best last-minute holidays to irish people in desperate need of escaping the bleak irish weather . 
  your beaches , your food , your architecture , your history , your array of things for tourists to do ... the list goes on . 
  you have a lovely language and your traditional music is amazing . 
  do n't stop being awesome . 
  ** finland : ** two words . 
  heavy . 
  metal . 
  apocalyptica , children of bodom , lordi and more . 
  keep making awesome music . 
  you also gave us some of the best phones in the world . 
  let 's not forget the saunas . 
  or the dudesons . 
  and shout outs to france ( lots of things for tourists to do , daft punk ) , italy ( the cuisine , the architecture , the history ) and germany ( rammstein , oktoberfest , good food , the chocolate and that character from hetalia ) . 
  do n't stop being awesome !, 
   or countries like south korea and china have done reduce wages to the chinese level to be more competitive , demolish the welfare system ( taxes do n't just appear out of nowhere ) , start an even more damaging race to the bottom , as if fiscal competition was n't enough already . 
  maybe that one is not a good idea . 
  just laying cards on the table , but you make a point on that one . 
  though i still do n't see anything wrong with another eu country or two becoming a tax haven like ireland . 
  ~ ~ actually , i do , but only on a personal , selfish level . 
  not sure if other countries in the eu are tax havens , but we are definitely benefitting from it ~ ~ . 
   the only thing that sounds unfair and very odd in this story is that the fees were apparently changed `` at a moment 's notice '' you make another point . 
  but it would be wise for the commission to take a long hard look at what uk and nl are doing , and consider recommending other eu member states to take note of what nl and uk are doing , and see if that will help improve their economies . 
  rather than expect poorer eu countries to be fully dependent on their wealthier counterparts . 
  i suppose this crosses out what i 've said in my original post above , about eu companies investing in poorer eu countries . 
  since that does technically make the latter countries somewhat dependent on the countries those companies originated from . 
  i was actually suggesting that the less wealthier states set up factories and r&d facilities to attract companies from other states . 
  i just wanted to make sure i worded that correctly , which i probably did n't . 
   if you want prosperity in all european nations , wealthier nation states must pay poorer ones . 
  i disagree . 
  i think poorer nations should advertise themselves to foreign investors like ireland did , or countries like south korea and china have done , to make more money . 
  that way , the poorer countries would remain financially independent . 
  also , this is not about the uk and netherlands having to help out countries in need , which they 've been doing since the crisis began . 
  this is about the european commission being pissed because the uk and netherlands did things their own way and benefitted from it , instead of doing things the commission 's way and boosting their ego in the process . 
  so britain and the netherlands are pretty much being punished because they did something right ? 
  i 've always known that juncker would be a poor choice for europe . 
  he did lose his government to a pre-mature general election last year , after all . 
  you 've made some points there . 
  but a lot of people i know do n't see it that way . 
  not even my parents , who are catholic themselves . 
  almost everyone i know in person either supports recognising palestine or have not yet mentioned their opinions on palestine .
