  not once . 
  new ships and jets could tremendously help our peacekeeping efforts abroad , as would mbt 's but at the moment that 's just a pipe dream, 
  eh , our naval service is grand although 5 or 6 more ships would be ideal now do n't get me wrong , i am heavily in favour of an actual air force , not the joke we have now and i 'd love for us to buy some modern jets, 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/air_corps_ ( ireland ) i wish we could do more, 
  yeah i agree with you there . 
  irelands airforce is a joke , google it and you 'll see what i mean . 
  and the big nations like france , germany and spain or even italy should do more . 
  thing is though , bombs alone wo n't stop isis and the real problem is the toxic ideology they spread europe wide, 
  aww , is the little italian angry ? 
  run along now and bribe the mafia to continue using the internet to shout at people like the big lad you are, 
  ahh there it is . 
  fuck neutrality am i right ? 
  if you think ireland had anything more to add to the allied side in ww2 other than the help we gave , you need to open a history book, 
  italy hardly fucked anyone in ww1 , they were just as hilariously incompetent as the austrians, 
  not bombing isis does n't make a country cowardly, 
  what ? 
  i do n't think most europeans were thinking why the people of the us deserved or why they got 9/11 i think we were thinking `` holy fuck that 's horrible '', 
  w-what ? 
  you do realise that fascism is inherently anti communism ? 
  you 've triggered the overly sensitive irish people op, 
  haha , thanks for this it 's always important to keep a good mood, 
  how can they be stopped before the eu though ? 
  turkey is holding us to ransom , libya is a mess and i have no idea what morocco , algeria or tunisia is doing to help stop the flow, 
  you 're right . 
  this was coming since paris , after nothing was ~ ~ down ~ ~ done to stop the flow of refugees to europe and since governments did little to stop this again this truly is a disgusting , cowardly attack on innocents, 
  my friends were marking themselves and each other safe during the nepal earthquake as some kind of joke i hope belgians will get some use out of it, 
  of most people agreed with you you would be upvoted , but clearly most people here are n't mentally retarded like yourself and see that you 're an ignorant , bigoted troll, 
  please do n't confuse the actions of our government with how people feel nobody likes this stupid law but it 's a non issue for all politicians, 
  even then it 's nuch much better than fptp, 
  yes i 'm sure the likes of india will spend time arguing with the uk for a trade deal, 
  le pen is a rotten piece of shit , trump would be better off totally ignoring this endorsement, 
  quick correction , first full results should be out by afternoon , all will take most of the evening to be released , sorry, 
  http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0227/771139-live-election-2016/ constitutes here : http://www.rte.ie/news/election-2016/constituencies/ results should be fully out by late afternoon, 
  yes i think we should wait for more info . 
  without anything else to go by this thread will become pretty shit removing this would be best, 
  ireland is more important to the eu than denmark ever will be, 
  you see this is why no one likes the brits, 
  english gon na english, 
  i fucking love pasta and a lot of my friends eat it multiple times a week down here in waterford, 
  the thing is though , ukraine before euromaidan was a shithole , and whilst belarus is n't the best place to live in , it certainly is n't as bad as ukraine was so , the people probably do n't have a real need for revolution, 
  where did it all go wrong, 
  that 's his actual height still a top lad though, 
  and where exactly is isis or al qaeda going to get a dirty bomb ? 
  do n't scare monger man be realistic, 
  i mean jesus could he not hire a prostitute at least fucking hell, 
  yes they are called the tiger forces you dumbass , research a bit before you talk shit . 
  the east aleppo offensive is entirely saa and syaaf , no iraqi militias there, 
  refugees have a right to amnesty yes , but they ignored this when they landed in safe and stable countries like italy and greece and left in favour of richer ones they broke eu law , they do n't deserve our hospitality any longer, 
  the catholic population was treated like shit before the ira came along , the civil rights movement was n't extremely effective, 
  you see people , this is what happens when the borders are opened . 
  why are n't the police armed yet , they are clearly outnumbered ^ \\ s,

  ff lost 75 % if their support and for the first time in 80 years , they were not the most voted party in ireland . 
  fine gael takes the reigns and continues austerity until 2015 . http://www.ronanlyons.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/irish-general-election-2011.png not a picture but sums it up well, 
  and turkey has shot down a greek jet, 
  what is the alternative to assad now though ? 
  it would have been better for everyone of he had been ousted during the protests but there is no moderate opposition left . 
  terrorists and islamists dominate the opposition and the sdf will never rule more than rojava, 
  your countries support of terrorist affiliates in syria is prolonging the war you idiot . 
  not to mention you caused the rise of isis by bring freedom to iraq in 2003 you americans and your freedom and democracy . 
  how much more damage will you do to the middle east ? 
  better to kill an unborn child and save the mother than let both die it 's also better to save the child from a shit upbringing or a mother who does n't want it, 
  oh yeah it 's the ua 's fault for firing at an invading foreign force idiot, 
  classic british troll your empire is gone mate , fuck off, 
  the police have the bastards trapped in an apartment hopefully no policemen or women get injured during the raid, 
  have you actually ever met a muslim ? 
  or do you just enjoy being a racist in your basement ? 
  ok so using your logic : the us army has killed thousands of innocent people , therefore everyone in the army is a bad person, 
  do you have any proof of most of them being `` bad people '' ? 
  jesus you are unbelievable . 
  maybe a dozen were involved in the attacks and you paint the billion + muslims worldwide as bad people . 
  the fact that people actually support this stupid action is worrying do you idiots not remember afghanistan and iraq ? 
  isis is worse than both of them and once the public sees want happens to their captured soldiers ... you 're playing right into isis hands by wanting this , they 've been foaming at the mouth for a western christian invasion since the start and you want to give it to them, 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_school_shootings_in_the_united_states none so far in november but you get my point, 
  yeah forget about all the mass shootings every month in america by christians, 
  and around 100 hostages as well , unfortunately i think the death toll will rise further, 
  it 's more in al qaeda style than isis to to things like this, 
  christ this is horrible , looks like they were coordinated like the ile de france attacks in january, 
  eyewitness at the restaurant says the shots were aimed towards the kitchens , so maybe that one was a personal vendetta and not a terrorist attack, 
  fuck , not again, 
  i do n't know man it might be the 27 % unemployment rate, 
  knocked out in the group stages of the football world cup , the cricket wc , and now the rwc at least they 're consistent, 
  delete and resubmit it then ? 
  haha whatever buddy, 
  eh , those who chose not to vote have no right to say anything about the result, 
  grab em by the brexit, 
  genocidal lmao you do n't know what genocide is m8 . 
  ca n't wait to hear you explain this one, 
  no we should support him as the best option for syria at the moment inb4 muh sdf . 
  they rule the north and they will never be able to rule the country, 
   many of which are controlled by the kurds wrong . 
  maybe a small bit south of hasakha but the vast majority not in saa hands is under isis control around palmyra and dez, 
  even the people are made of cement, 
   the communists varoufakis already had his go at the finances, 
  lmao . 
  typical pro rebel bullshit . 
  keep supporting the likes of zenki and aqsa , child beheaders mate big bad assad amirite !, 
  i do n't know if you realised but it 's called the eu nowadays, 
  you 're fairly fucking sad to reply to a two day old conversation lad, 
  me too,
