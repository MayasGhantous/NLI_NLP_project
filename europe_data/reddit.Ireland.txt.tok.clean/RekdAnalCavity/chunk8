  sorry , did you try and make a point there ? 
  i must have missed it, 
  to keep out the brown people of course, 
  yes they are , match them up and see, 
  eh it 's getting a good chunk of england there too, 
  no you spastic , you 're getting into your imperialistic semantics . 
  the republic is independent and has 0 connection to your little monarchy, 
  and if this gets swept under the rug by establishment parties , expect the far right to rise again in the polls, 
  he died a few minutes ago edit : https://twitter.com/charles_lister/status/810892547073703937, 
  if you 're going for halfway there then it all depends on regional accents, 
  it 's not pronounced like that, 
  more like everyone else made it a referendum on renzi, 
  lol , keep thinking you 're the victim bud, 
  here we go , muh clean wehrmacht r/shitwehraboossay, 
  he works for the sun probably, 
  pro eu parties do n't tend to piss away the money the eu gives them, 
  and you 're trying to undermine bis credibility by throwing out the word genocide ( hint , you do n't know what it means ) do you not realise how stupid you sound ? 
  but i suppose reason has no place in this sub anymore, 
  biji greater serbia , long live the jna, 
  the `` derogatory '' part of that is made up by western media so they can feel good about themselves when they supposedly insult the islamic state, 
  anti fascists back then compared to now are not even on the same planet with how they act, 
  saying that the wehrmacht did n't support nazi ideologies and yet willingly took part in their crimes is a perf criminal example of muh clean wehrmacht do n't defend this shit, 
  neoliberals are generally centrist, 
   the elite of most western countries and even russia speak french hahahahaha its not the 1700 's anymore lad, 
  go back to r/socialism, 
  ah yes because politicians are one monolithic bloc and definitely not individual people, 
  considering like 80 % of ireland considers themselves catholic in the census , there 's your answer, 
  lol no they sent armoured vehicles , not `` literally tanks '' . 
  those things are necessary to protect life and property from murderous thugs that riot like animals, 
  he thinks he 's funny , but he 's really not, 
  there is no one capable of keeping government held syria together other than assad or another regime figure that has his blessing there 's a reason some chant `` allah , souriya , bashar w bas '' - god , syria , bashar and noting else, 
  1919 worst year of my life rip austria-hungary, 
  eh trump is many things but [ anti lgbt is not one of them ] ( http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/11/01/trump.jpg ), 
  i would n't want a monument dedicated to foreign invaders in my country either, 
  a ) depends on where you 're from b ) there is no direct english sound equivalent of a lot of irish sounds, 
  yeah , '' '' '' '' `` british '' '' '' '' '' no attempts made to integrate whatsoever , these monsters are n't brits . 
  never will be, 
  david come back , please, 
  everyone 's nose is in their field of view, 
  if me and my family want to form our own country , and we hold a vote , what 's the problem ? 
  pretty dope t shirt, 
  alright , we should be calling isis sandniggers every time we refer to them and just straight up call boko haram and al shabaab niggers , cus who cares right ? 
  no , i want local representatives, 
  being recognised by even a single actual state would help like i said de facto yes , strictly speaking , no, 
  de facto you could call them a state yes but that does n't make them one as for a lot of armed forces and territory ... yeah they 're not gon na be that way for long . 
  they 've been reduced to a single neighbourhood in mosul and raqqa is currently being liberated . 
  not to mention every day they lose territory elsewhere, 
  at least it 's sort of justified with the dup ukip was n't even that bad , for lots of people being against uncontrolled immigration = being a racist prick, 
  what are you surprised about ? 
  they had no seats before the election and are n't popular enough in any 1 spot to actually win a new seat, 
  deal with it, 
  fuck me , i have n't thought about that orange in years, 
  yeah , seems similar to that guy who tried to attack the louvre, 
  https://twitter.com/afp/status/872102075307569155 dickhead with a hammer tried to attack police , was shot if this is a terrorist attack its extremely low energy, 
  i think he meant the cats are used as pest control, 
  ah yes , merkels way or the highway if you do n't want to take in masses of refugees , leave the eu i hope to god you 're never in a position of power, 
  the ira did n't represent catholics, 
  diane `` i do n't consider myself british '' abbot, 
  i do n't know why people think coveney was a better choice his campaign was disastrously ran , he 's extremely uncharismatic and did n't exactly reveal much of what he believed in . 
  top it off with the fact that he said the results of the a citizens assembly were worrying , and you have a terrible candidate people have done nothing but make up shit about varadkar in the last few weeks , and when you press them on these fake claims all you get are `` you 're a tory like leo , you hate the poor , you hate the unemployed '' never an actual answer from people , and that shithole r/ireland is the worst for it, 
  source on where he said marriage is between a man and a woman ? 
  yes , that 's the joke, 
  he 's not a bad singer, 
  stop being obtuse and explain what he 's doing, 
  only kids belive wrestling is `` real '' , but we still watch it for the sheer entertainment value that 's not to say that wrestling is fake , it 's am extremely physically and mentally taxing sport, 
  there 3 different types of averages looks like you did n't even cover a part of mathematics called statistics, 
  that does n't matter , you 're still wrong, 
  no one cares stop being so needlessly aggressive, 
   [ mfw they think the media reporting what happens in turkey is propaganda ] ( http://gph.is/2m8etxa ) mfw they lap up the sewage erdo\u011fan spews, 
  we are , i was making fun of the fact that opponents of fine gael refer to them as fascists because of their former affiliation to the blueshirts , a fascist movement in ireland in the 30 's that was kicked out of fine gael, 
  will ya gway with your historical facts and let us spread lies about enda and his fascists, 
  putin and erdo\u011fan have already become butt buddies since the jet fiasco, 
  europe had a go of that from 1922-1945 you can piss off with that idea, 
  translated to real money that 's about 6.50 $ or so not nearly as exciting, 
  charlie hebdo is trash tier satire the only reason they 're famous is because of the terror attack against them, 
  r/shittymapporn awaits, 
  https://www.np.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/69t5bb/congratulations_to_the_next_leader_of_france/dh96kws they 're also creaming themselves at the prospect of having to invade france to protect the good white people from the muslim hordes lmao so salty it 's amazing . 
  they mock clinton supporters and look at them now, 
  btfo list wilders \u2705 hoffer \u2705 le pen \u2705 soon to be btfo afd \u2705, 
  the estimates are very accurate , they were nearly spot on in the first round, 
  he actually won by more than the latest poll indicated this is amazing, 
  macron president fuck me i 'm so happy about this . 
  let pen got her ass whooped 65-35 !, 
  this is a huge win for europe vive la france !, 
  that 's not a guy ? 
  that 's a damn good painting, 
  [ yeah that was on purpose ] ( http://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1456/62/1456621427070.png ), 
  * sigh * as you wish !, 
  the building on the left is quite nice for a communist building, 
  i mean , it could have been written better but i am would n't exactly call it poorly written . 
  whoever corrected this was just looking for some cheap political points, 
  macron is quite charismatic he did not `` go where the win blows '' , he built his movement from the ground up into what it is today ( from only a year ago ) and macron has not been in the shadows , in fact the direct opposite of that . 
  since he left government and founded en marche !, 
  he 's been out there 24/7, 
  what ? 
  you just made that entirely up lad , that is mentioned exactly nowhere in the article, 
  that 's not what the european union is about . 
  a larger country ca n't just lord over a smaller one to force the result they want this is a union of 27 equals, 
  tbh people are just looking to discredit melenchons voters however they can , and i say that as a macron supporter, 
  hence the ish,
