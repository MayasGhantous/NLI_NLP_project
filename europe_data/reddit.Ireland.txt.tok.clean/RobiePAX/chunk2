  i was personally for russia , and find it rather suspicious that lithuania has n't given a single point to them considering that there are a lot of russians in the capital , there are even russian cities in lt. 
  but sweden was well deserved , they were my second most favorite this year . 
  truly feel sorry for germany , i actually found their performance quite interesting and most definitely did n't deserve 0 points . 
  there 's a lot of propaganda out there that europe is extremely anti-russian . 
  i hope this years eurovision shows that 's most certainly not true to such high degree . 
  ** edit : ** thanks @playmewhile for the [ useful link ] ( http://www.eurovision.tv/page/results?event=2083&amp;voter=lt ) . 
  so people did vote for russia quite high , 3rd place in fact . 
  judges are the ones who buried that score by giving their own bad scores ( 2 out of 5 judges going as far as giving russia the very last place ) . 
  sigh ... sometimes i wish they would get rid of the judges and let the people vote 100 % of the score , not 50 % . 
  these contests are much more fun without dumb and plainly obvious political agendas around . 
  holy shit really ? 
  we had no idea !, 
  in what brilliant day and age we live in today . 
  you see a crime , you report a crime to the public , you get arrested for reporting a crime . 
  i miss snow :( - ex lithuanian, 
  i would n't want a gay turtle . 
  especially if i would plan to use it for breeding . 
  would n't be very happy to find out that i purchased a defective turtle later on . 
  option 2 it is . 
  i wish ** lithuania ** could be renamed to the proper way it 's natively called and actually easier to pronounce ** lietuva ** . 
  whoever added `` hua '' when he discovered the country is an english moron . 
  makes no sense then why the latvia was not named let 's say `` lathuania or latviania '' . 
  sorry , old habits . 
  while not illegal , you can still get banned over half of the internet sites for linking to such content . 
  my eyes hurt . 
  but kitty makes it beautiful . 
  rest in peace asad . 
  europe needs more people like you if it ever is going to stop the hate in this region . 
  he died for showing how a real muslim should act . 
  good on you poles . 
  someone finally has some common sense . 
  accept the refugees if there is a lack of workers . 
  but do n't f *** ing take them when there 's a huge unemployment as it is . 
  it 's like sending refugees to spain ... they will simply migrate due to lack of work or start stealing and contributing to crime . 
  whatever is more profitable . 
  quite sad that he let it rub on him . 
  you ca n't change the past or run from it forever . 
  people would deal with it , and his subject knowledge was not questioned . 
  even if he would change place of work , his name is on the internet news now and it 's impossible to hide it . 
  he should have just stayed . 
  well , my ocd will have to deal with it for another few decades . 
  it seems gays forget that middle east is not the only region that dislikes them . 
  originally coming from a eastern european country i can confirm , it 's better to stay in the closet for them . 
  i have n't heard anything about such decision . 
  only hear about raised rates to qualify for free shipping . 
  german politicians should who are defending this migrant policy should shut the fuck up . 
  france has more personal reasons to criticize this policy than anyone else . 
  i do n't understand why eu ca n't show some compromise in rules for uk so they would be happy to stay in eu . 
  it is a fact that they are facing unreasonable immigration situation , which is one of highest concerns the brits have . 
  normally i 'd say put the scumbag into prison . 
  then again it will be just a service for him . 
  food , roof under the head . 
  so much for a punishment . 
  no it was not . 
  before soviet union `` re-acquired '' lithuania there was no such thing as visaginas . 
  it was just a forest with few housing lands here and there , and the region was known as snechkus . 
  it is the youngest city in lithuania . 
  soviets forced lithuania back to the soviet union . 
  at that point it 's ussr territory . 
  nuclear plant construction has began . 
  problem occured . 
  there were too many workers that would n't all fit to the barracks . 
  in 1975 a soviet project has begone to resolve that problem , and construction of a town that we know today as visaginas has began . 
  later lithuania declared independence , chain reaction led to fall of ussr . 
  both nuclear plant and visaginas projects were halted . 
  visaginas was recognized as re-emerged lithuania 's town despite the fact that it was solely funded by soviet economy . 
  lithuania is no stranger to such interesting facts . 
  for instance the capital vilnius arguably is polish due to disputing history . 
  visaginas - the russian town that was built for the ignalina 's nuclear power plant workers . 
  it has a heavily russian speaking population even to this day . 
  after lithuania got their independence , visaginas has become part of lithuania , while nuclear power plant eventually got shut down . 
  i 'm originally from a russian town that has become part of lithuania after fall of the soviet union , so i am a russian european . 
  i watch a lot of news coverage from the us media , european media , russian media and independent reporters on various political topics . 
  believe me when i say this , there is a massive amount of propaganda on all sides . 
  left , middle and right . 
  there is almost always some sort of bias , disinformation or not enough information given . 
  so it 's laughable for me to read this article . 
  russia may be spreading propaganda , but germany should n't pretend they are not doing the same . 
  i highly doubt whenever that region will ever be stable . 
  maybe it will have peace for 5-20 years and then some bullshit will happen and back to war . 
  it 's highly `` optimistic '' to say the least to hope that these refugees will return home simply because it 's safe now . 
  they would much more prefer living where you get free welfare and support because you are a `` refugee '' . 
  well it 's forced by the law either way . 
  if you commit a crime , it does n't matter whenever you are a refugee you will still have to answer for your actions . 
  it 's not guns that we need in europe . 
  it 's common sense in the politics what we need . 
  to stop inviting highly potential threat into here . 
  while my stance on this subject is mixed , i still think this mayor is a moron . 
  yes , if an attractive girl dresses up like a slut then she will receive sexual attention . 
  which provokes sexual harassment ( which obviously still does n't excuse rape ) . 
  however grandfather is referring to 10 year old girl here . 
  and the answers this mayor gives makes me question how did he get such position in the first place . 
  i 'm not working for the spy agency , and i know isis does that . 
  german spies are a bit slow . 
  sure , and all those women in germany were making up their stories as well . 
  maybe bavarian leader is simply not a moron and does n't automatically jumps on `` let us all hate russia '' band-wagon without merit . 
  what an idiotic decision . 
  either turn off comments entirely or leave them on . 
  hand picking topics what people can and ca n't discuss was the worst decision they could have done . 
  so much for champion of free speech .
