- dublin coddle ( stew with sausages , fried onions , bacon , potatoes and carrots ) and boxty ( potato pancakes ) from dublin/west of ireland respectively - wildschweinwurst from germany - haggis , neeps and tatties ( parsnip and potatoes ) and cullen skink ( fish chowder ) from scotland - gyros from greece - clafoutis from france, 
  they would n't , but they do n't . 
  makes it reflect on those people even worse , whether you intended that or not . 
  could also be contributed to the lack of foreign language ability too . 
  kinda puts a limit on how ! many people from your country can be working for the eu and expanding your country 's influence in it if they ca n't communicate and work with people from other eu states, 
  the irish archipelago . 
  if you think that co-existing is a suitable juxtaposition for imperialism , then you need your head examined . 
  do you think during the british empire that the eton-educated westminster elite genuinely considered an irishman , a scot , welshman , indian , afrikaner , northern englishman , arab , kenyan , sri lankan , or singaporean to be their neighbour , or even remotely equal to them ? 
  you 're lying to yourself if you think that this is coexistence . 
  coexistence is a two-way street . 
  if the majority if the scottish and catalonian people - two groups who are fundamentally culturally , historically , politically and ( kinda ) linguistically distinct and have been for a long time , then their claim to nationhood is a valid one . 
  that is , if they wish to be . 
  i 'm ready to accept , embrace and even argue for the reality of a federalist europe , but our ties to our nations and compatriots ca n't be so easily dismissed as being `` nationalist '' . 
  the diversity of this continent is one of our greatest strengths , and therefore doing what 's right to preserve that is n't always going to be something everyone will like . 
  feelings are going to be hurt , and people are going to get pissed off . 
  unlike previous empires , this europe is not going to be built on hegemony , hierarchy and social darwinism . 
  do n't for one second try to excuse or explain away what former colonial powers have done . 
  it 's awfully easy to espouse these kinds of views that you have mentioned when you feel none if the consequences of them . 
  in descending order of proficiency - english - native - german - b2 bordering on c1 - irish - b2 - spanish ( peninsular ) - b1 - french - a2 but my aural skills are a bit shite . 
  i 'm starting to learn danish and flemish , and want to learn hungarian at some point in the future . 
  since i 'm on the mainland in germany , it 's much easier to find people to practice my languages with , besides irish , which i have only once been able to converse with another speaker since i came here . 
  cheers for the answer mate , did n't mean to be hostile , just wanted more detail . 
  to answer the first question - about as much as americans watch the irish parliamentary and presidential elections . 
  ours is a parliamentary constitutional republic , so we vote in a party whose leader becomes our taoiseach ( prime minister ) and the leader of the coalition party if a coalition is formed becomes t\u00e1iniste ( second minister ) . 
  our country is small so our elections are very decentralized , based on electoral areas based on factors like population and geography . 
  as such , there is county government and national government , no in-between . 
  so our system is very different . 
  we also have a presidential election , but the president has a different role . 
  here 's how i compare the two . 
  ** american elections ** a pissing contest between two people who * other * people think are completely different but are really pretty much the same , while anyone who votes or wants to vote differently is shouted down and bullied into voting for one or the other . 
  all you have to do is * be jingoistic as fuck * have lots and lots of money * know people that have even more money * talk shit about mexicans and other spanish-speaking countries of the americas * do not give a flying fuck about other countries , or the fact that there * are * other countries , and piss them off and fuck up their shit accordingly * completely ignore the fact that guns and violence are a serious issue * do n't do anything about it because there 's a heap of gun nut fuckheads who will go postal if you do . 
  ** ours are more like ** * talk about how the other political party fucked up so badly that you ca n't do any better but vote you in * promise your friends from secondary school jobs * promise anything to anyone , anywhere , anytime ... but right now * get nigerian lads to stuff your postbox full of leaflets * promise to get that pothole outside ballaghadreen fixed * put yourself up for election because you just want the salary , reimburements and lifetime pension * get the endorsement of your local gaa club * open your campaign office beside a pub , or in one * be a barman or bar owner , or former barman or bar owner * have a mother that makes ham sandwiches and cuts them into triangles . 
  you 'd think though that america being bigger , more influential and possessing weaponry that could turn the world into a living hell and thus with a greater duty of care would be somewhat more mature and responsible about their politics , but no - it 's still a juvenile shitshow . 
  the same goes for my country , but ireland does n't have nukes or cia blacksites around the world , like . 
  edit : formatting, 
  hmm , normally the british media are oddly quiet when it comes to the loyalists and the shit they pull . 
  they know full well this is just a racist , bigoted crusade under the guise of `` culture '' and it 's not surprising considering the loyalist links with combat 18 , the edl , the kkk and other miscellaneous white supremacist groups . 
  it 's not the first time irish community has been antagonized by these bigoted pricks and it wo n't be the last . 
  but of course the british media normally likes to make it out to be our fault in a completely one-sided discourse , knowing that they 're the only source of knowledge the british public in general get about the conflict . 
  but of course , they 'll talk about rioting but they wo n't talk about the thinly veiled display of rabid ethnic hatred that are the 12th of july parades . 
  that ... that 'd be fair fuckin ' lovely , i tell ya now . 
  no , it 's not going to happen and should n't , and any linguist worth their salt will tell you that . 
  in fact you 'd be straight up laughed out the door . 
  [ in this google talk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3pwg4uoj0y&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1h2s ) chomsky explains very well how homogenisation of language use is n't conducive to human growth . 
  also , this argument for a universal language is more-often-than-not made by people who either have little language ability beyond their own and most typically english-speakers . 
  the teaching and learning of languages has to increase , yes , and britain is shooting itself in the foot by closing down language faculties in universities and rolling back on foreign language programs . 
  i 'm guessing one of the very reasons that britain feels somewhat underrepresented in the workings of the eu is because it ca n't field enough people who are proficient in languages to do the jobs . 
  plus , the eu guarantees protections for the languages and cultures of its member states , and it 's ticking along just fine . 
  it 's not a broken system , so there 's no point in trying to fix it . 
  you 're not going to make that change any day soon and you and anyone else with this opinion will encounter fierce resistance . 
  it 's much easier to teach people that learning another language is n't going to fucking kill them compared to trying to implement a universal language across damn near an entire continent . 
  not gon na happen . 
  they look like someone who would serve you a bucket of chicken . 
  from a howitzer . 
  it boggles the mind that someone would even make a joke out of harrassing someone who is authorized to used armed force to fulfill their mandate of protecting the monarch of their state and their palace grounds . 
  there has to be something wrong with you in the head to think that that 's alright to do . 
  who would be that thick to go up to a professional , trained , seasoned soldier with an sa80 rifle and pull that shite ? 
  would n't matter if the fella had a dildo strapped to his forehead and was chicken dancing through his patrol route , i 'd keep well the fuck away . 
  this reminds me of a gathering we were having at my university in conjunction with the german embassy and goetheinstitut and the irish people not wanting to live up to the stereotype of us being late arrived early to make sure we were n't late , and the germans arrived late because they thought we 'd be late anyway so decided to wait a while .

  did n't realize social darwinism was alive and well on this sub . 
  just because a child picks up a language without lessons does not mean it is necessarily `` easy '' for them . 
  while they are acquiring a language they are still acquiring their ability to grasp the structures and meanings of language in general . 
  that in itself is a long , drawn out and even difficult process . 
  it can take them years and years to learn orthography , vocabulary , grammar , correct use of pronouns etc. 
  and have to be constantly corrected and shown otherwise , while an adult can do so consciously because they can already make sense out of the intrinsic meaning behind utterances with symbolic meanings and are fully aware of their functions - like how possessive pronouns denote ownership , subjunctives denote conditionality and so on . 
  as such , when we say `` children learn languages easier '' it 's a misnomer and a lack of understanding of the difference between how an adult learns a language versus how a child does . 
  also , the argument often tends to be put forward by people who have n't made an effort to learn a language to begin with , so it 's fair to assume that many who put forward the argument do so out of apathy . 
  if you 're looking for some further reading then have a look at these . 
  - planet word by michael joseph - the language instinct by stephen pinker the next two do not cover language acquisition so much as they do the cognitive process behind language use , and provide valuable context . 
  - michael halliday and ruqaiya hassan - language , context , and text : aspects of language in a social-semiotic perspective - karl buehler : theory of language some of the stuff by john searle and noam chomsky ( obviously ) is great too . 
  that 's a myth that becomes quickly dispelled when you even just scratch the surface of how first language and foreign language acquisition works . 
  never once in my languages degree program , including my linguistics lectures , had this come up because it does n't hold any water when put up against modern research into cognitive and neurolinguistics . 
  the myth that adults find it harder to learn languages emerges from hypotheses taken from studies on first language acquisition . 
  the critical period hypothesis is far more to do with acquiring the ability to interpret , make sense of and produce language as a child ( which definitely does have a window ) than it is based on acquiring a foreign language . 
  you do n't learn the same way as children when you 're an adult , so you 're going to fail if you think you 're going to learn a language as a child would . 
  it does n't mean it 's harder though , it 's not an ability we lose , however it may feel so due to an adults time and social commitments . 
  you could spin that the other way though , in saying that all of the english-speakers who go to holiday in spain should have all learned spanish by now since they go there so often . 
  works both ways . 
  what 's key is improving language proficiency in general , all starting with the younger generation . 
  it 's a win-win for everyone , and any country that does n't foster multilingualism in their children is shooting themselves in the foot , in the end of the day . 
  if they want to leave , they want to leave . 
  if they do n't , they do n't . 
  we already have free trade and movement agreements with them and them with us , so on that front it would n't change a whole lot . 
  there is n't really a whole lot of strong opinion here besides that , at least that i 've come across . 
  most of what i 've heard is that there are banks currently with offices in the uk who have come to dublin to scout out potential locations . 
  if they * do * leave , i 'm sure our economy could do with the jobs . 
  but still , it 's not exactly some cataclysmic event being prepared for like . 
  if you replaced turkish with irish and muslim with catholic , our position would be the exact same . 
  there are the over-40 's who the church still has sway over and you still would n't tell your granny that you are an atheist and you certainly would n't be launching into anti-religious diatribes at family gatherings , but the younger generations either are n't religious at all or even hostile towards and religious influence in their life . 
  however , we also do n't deny that catholicism has had a certain influence on our culture and our nation as a whole . 
  sound similar ? 
  though i 'm sure that the akp in turkey , knowing that the younger generations are not even remotely as succeptible to religious influence that old tayyip seems all to eager to spout to keep the older generations manipulated , he appeals to the nationalistic side of younger people moreso than the religious . 
  this will have the honourable place of being the stupidest fucking thing i 've heard this week . 
  be proud , son . 
  regional culture ? 
  france has n't exactly been kind to the breton , sard , alsatian , catalonian , occitan , flemish , piedmontese and other linguistic and cultural minorities in the past . 
  the french , british and indeed any other colonial powers ' past or present solution has been to stop them from speaking their language , make them speak yours , force them into the toughest occupations , make war on eachother , ( attempt to ) wipe out their cultural heritage and sanitize and bleach any of their cultural heritage deemed worthy of being kept . 
  nothing wrong with being a small country , makes a nice change from being wrapped up in the pissing contests and egotism of bigger countries .
