is n't labour in deep trouble as well ? 
  they seemed almost irrelevant during the campaign and a lot of areas in northern england where labour won in 2015 voted leave . 
  ukip came second in many seats won by labour in 2015 and ukip appears bent on expanding there . 
  then of course , corbyn seems more like a liability to his party right now than an asset . 
  a few people have said that england and wales appear poised to move to the right . 
  based on the record to date , that means more confrontation with the eu . 
  i do n't see this ending well . 
   i got the impression from the leave voters that i talked to that it was more immigration from outside the eu that they feared that 's my impression as well and in that respect brexit is ironic . 
  the foreign born population in the uk is now [ about 13 percent of the total ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/21/5-facts-about-migration-and-the-united-kingdom/ ) and 2/3 are from non-eu countries . 
  migrants from other eu countries generally integrate/assimilate well into british society . 
  the polish communities that arrived in the 1940s in the uk are now completely integrated/assimilated into britosh society . 
  the same ca n't be said unfortunately about other communities who have been in the uk for decades . 
  there 's a building in london that [ kind of looks like that tower ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2010/8/12/1281629992705/the-strata-building-in-el-006.jpg?w=620&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=d8bc3ddf222021e9ebd73bbd202f0c6e ) from lord of the rings . 
  all that is missing is a big red eye . 
   [ ... ] popular support for the european union has been declining for a long time . 
  what are you basing that on ? 
  in a poll in my country in may by the main organisation that carries out polls found that 77 percent thought we should remain even if you guys left . 
  that is not a post-brexit temporary surge at all . 
   [ ... ] even if an entire nation voted unanimously for one outcome the other nations could simply enforce another outcome for more and more fields of policy ) . 
  the u.k. is also a union of different countries . 
  whichever way wales or scotland vote in a uk wide election , it 's england that decides the outcome . 
  that 's true even when scotland decides something with a very clear majority . 
  i found farage 's anger about about foreign politicians campaigning for remain ( especially obama ) quite hypocritical given that he had done the same in the lisbon referendum here . 
  it 'd been a while since i 'd read comments on youtube . 
  til the eu is `` pure evil . '', 
  having seen the barrages of angry comments from brexiteers on social media , you have to wonder how much of this anger is a product of years of being fed lies about the eu . 
  no , no !, 
  the # 350 million is going to the nhs once the uk leaves !, 
  we already have a [ good picture ] ( https://youtu.be/yiyq5xmw98i ) of what the nhs will look like once it happens . 
  that 's the one . 
  thanks for your reply . 
  whatever helps you sleep at night lad . 
   but after 3 insults in as many comments , i really do n't see why i should bother and at this stage you are just trolling . 
  but one final thing i want you to know , the irish establishment and many irish people wanted the uk to stay together and were less than supportive of the uk leaving . 
  now , with ukip on the rise and many insults from leavers , that has changed . 
  well done , you have estranged one of your closest neighbours and economic partners , who will be far more sympathetic to scottish independence/irish unification now . 
  that has all changed now and our governments are going to work very hard to keep things moving in that direction . 
   ** edit : ** i said this elsewhere but the irish political establishment were n't in favor of scottish independence nor brexit . 
  now and especially after the instability plus insults from brexiteers , they are a lot more open to scottish independence . 
  you 've estranged one of your closest neighbours and economic partners . 
  i would like to keep engaging with you , i really would . 
  but you 've insulted enough times that i 'm not going to bother . 
  the fact that you are unable to engage without doing so is a pretty poor testament to your character . 
  so i 'm just going to wish you good luck . 
  you 're going to need it . 
  i actually read the article ( or most of it i do n't have a subscription ) . 
  my point still stands that the political campaign of this `` peasant 's revolt '' ( to use the language of the article ) received plenty of funding from hedge funds and other wealthy parts of the establishment . 
  another example is murdoch , who has had a corrupting role in democracy in the uk for decades and whose red tops have been spinning lies about the eu for years . 
  finally , if there was a class division among remainders/leavers in england , the same was not true of n. ireland and scotland . 
  n. ireland is one of the poorest parts of the uk ( with plenty of seriously marginalised people there ) yet voted remain . 
  can you share your reasoning as to why working class voters there supposedly voted against their interests ? 
   people are sick of snobs like yourself labelling people as racist nationalists yet giving actual nationalists like the snp a free ride . 
  or as one irish commentator put it , this is english nationalism . 
  despite farage taking about the `` british people being fed up '' of the eu , it 's clear that whatever british people he 's referring to is that if england and wales . 
  farage and co. do n't care about scotland 's desire to stay in because majority rule . 
  that does n't spell well for the uk sticking together . 
  by the way , what percentage of scotland 's laws come from westminster ? 
  brexit voters are poor ... 
  right , so where does that leave boris , gove , farage and rees mogg ? 
  ** edit : ** in case you 're not aware there were/are some wealthy interests backing brexit , from hedge funds to wealthy entrepreneurs . 
  on the referendum results night he was at a party organised by some millionaire to celebrate the occasion . 
  but whatever helps you sleep at night lad . 
  here we go again . 
  while nothing new , the independence rhetoric is a tad ridiculous . 
  britain that colonised a huge part of the world should understand that it was never a colony of the e.u. 
  nor was it ever subjugated like scotland or even my country was . 
  i was there for a post-erasmus meetup a couple of years ago and visited the cathedral . 
  question for the french people on this sub , is there still a big tyre factory in clermont-ferrand ? 
  fine or community service ? 
  for sexually assaulting somebody ? 
  dear god . 
  i am guessing that that is the law it what is the reasoning behind this law ? 
  i mean , if somebody is 1 day away from being 18 , he should still be arrested and sent to a juvenile detention centre in my opinion . 
  then of course we know that many of them are just claiming that they are under 18 . 
  i found that one pretty bad as well . 
  is he really implying europe/eu is completely overrun by violent islamic extremists ? 
  i was just repeating their views , not mine . 
   since what he promised/demanded is something that is factually impossible [ ... ] what did he demand that was factually impossible ? 
  an end to free movement of labour ? 
  the ukip supporters i have come across ( both in person and online ) argue that the uk has zero influence in the eu anyway . 
   however , i think you ( and your leaders ) need to remember that the uk is still a friend of europe . 
  that depends on your perspective and whether you are in favour of the european union or not . 
  i 'd like you to understand that to many people here the referendum last week seemed to be a victory for farage above all . 
  his soundbite about independence was repeated * all day * on the radio here . 
  i for one am alarmed not at the fact that he wants the uk out , or other countries to hold referendums but that he openly wants the eu to be destroyed and repeated that in his victory speech in front of westminster . 
  gove has said similar things . 
  maybe it 's my irish roots , but i also find the talk of independence somewhat insulting in that britain was never a colony of the eu . 
  i did n't want you to leave or this separation to happen , but i respect the decision . 
  now that we go ahead with the separation , please do n't be surprised if there is animosity towards the british eurosceptics from countries like mine . 
  because the leaders of the eurosceptic side , as they repeated last week , do n't wish us well or have our best interest at heart . 
  farage goes to the parliament to make angry speeches about how the eu is such a scandal , waste of money , undemocratic etc. 
  but then he does absolutely nothing there apart from that and claims a salary plus expenses . 
  he does n't run on an abstentionist platform like nationalist parties in n. ireland do . 
  why should he get the benefits of being an mep ( speaking rights and salary ) without any of the responsibilities that come with it ? 
  not really comparable . 
  sinn f\u00e9in run on an abstentionist ticket so the people who vote for them know exactly that they will not take up their seats in westminster . 
  ukip does n't . 
  i do n't follow politics over there that much , but why do you think it 's such a shitshow ? 
  the markets and the pound have fallen but as an outsider it does n't seem to be that bad . 
  i thought romanian politics was being cleaned up thanks to anti-corruption crusaders like dna ?
