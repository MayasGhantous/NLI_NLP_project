  the thing is , brits and irish people drink tea in pretty much the exact way as most people would drink coffee , in huge quantities for largely utilitarian purposes : to socialise , relax , or get a mild caffeine high going . 
  irish people especially drink huge quantities of tea ; often first thing in the morning , after every meal , when meeting people , or simply as something to do . 
  we 're also pretty militant about our teas , and i know plenty of irish people would n't drink british tea , finding them far too weak . 
  i 'd have to agree fully with you . 
  i often feel like galway , limerick , sligo , and cork all have far more in common with each other than dublin . 
  dublin is like our london in that - because it is so large relative to the rest of the country - dubs give the appearance of having a hard time grasping what goes on beyond the m50 . 
  you could say the same thing about coffee , and yet plenty of european countries have traditions of serving their coffees drowning in various forms of dairy . 
  british ( especially northern/scots blends ) and irish blends of teas tend to quite bitter , rich in both tannins and caffeine . 
  it 's much nicer with a drop of milk . 
  there is , however , a special place in hell for people who think that the bergamot flavouring of earl grey should be served with milk . 
  * \u00d3l * has no relation to * \u00d6l * , however . 
  it 's interesting how the irish mythological figure of c\u00fa chulainn has been co-opted by both sides in the troubles , but most bizarrely by the unionists . 
  in the ulster cycle of irish mythology , c\u00fa chulainn fought for the kingdom of ulster , and held off the invading armies of the kingdom of connacht single-handedly , dying in the process . 
  unionists have reinterpreted this to mean that ` cuchulainn ' - [ the hero of ulster seen here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bmhfxdih.jpg ) - defended the native non-irish people of northern ireland from the invading forces of southern ireland . 
  in this way , they can legitimise northern ireland as being a kind of homeland to which the ulster scots have a greater claim than the irish . 
  it is interesting that something so far removed from the recent conflict was used by both sides to illustrate or narrativise their political claims ( c\u00fa chulainn is also used to refer to the ` blood sacrifice ' of the 1916 rising ) . 
  a lot of the comments are spot on , devolution is there to protect the regions of the uk from the centralisation of government in the home counties and to further the economic and cultural development of these regions ; not to disadvantage the english for no particular reason . 
  there 's a case to be made for granting devolution to parts of england , seeing as how parts of england are relatively disadvantaged compared to the home counties , but simply granting devolved status to england as a whole would do nothing to fix that . 
  as far as i 'm aware , we picked it up from our neighbours to the north . 
  they did have that * regrettable * period of time where one man might have more than one vote . 
   in northern ireland the local government franchise was not fully democratic . 
  a small number of property owners , amounting to about one and a half per cent of the electorate ( white , 1969 ) , had more than one vote . 
  a much larger number of adults , amounting to over a quarter of the parliamentary electorate in 1961 ( elliott , 1971 : 792 ) , had no vote . 
  and here was me thinking * gaeilge * is a proper noun . 
  it would n't be pretty . 
  there 's a kind of tragedy about ulster unionism in that it 's centred around an attachment to a britain that has n't existed in nearly a century . 
  they have little more common ground with anyone in great britain than republicans do . 
  if scotland were to leave , it might only further accentuate the sense of endangerment that they already feel . 
   also do n't the unionists in the north of ireland claim their scottish ancestry as a big reason for staying in the uk ? 
  i heard that once . 
  do n't know shite about politics though . 
  yes . 
  fair point . 
  i did just feel that / u/bowgentle 's wording was a bit leading . 
   the constitution did not give the government the power to give away any sovereignty , because that belongs solely to the people not any sovereignty , * external * sovereignty with regard to the state 's ability to conduct its foreign affairs . 
  the courts rejected crotty 's initial arguments that european treaties ratified solely by the oireachtas ` unlawfully surrendered irish sovereignty ' . 
  that 's a major over-simplification . 
  fine gael and fianna f\u00e1il are both vaguely centre-right , but fine gael have typically shied away from populism and compromise : just look at how they handled dissent within the parliamentary party over the abortion debates , contra fianna f\u00e1il 's fairly amiable relationship with independents and ` independent fianna f\u00e1il ' in the past and avoidance of taking controversial decisions publicly ( if at all ) . 
   the biggest group who want change want a united ireland except that irredentism is hardly separatism . 
  for that matter , why not add karelia to finland or republika srpska to serbia ? 
  we have a situation where people are divided between joining one country and remaining in another : for the purposes of this map the minority third position of independence is a suitable solution ( especially since it purports to allegedly show separatists ) . 
   to be fair no one is calling for ni independence but there have been people doing so in the past , and there is a minority undercurrent within ulster loyalism which seeks self-determination . 
  by the logic of popularity you could easily strike off most of the separatist movements from the map . 
   they have their own distinctive celtic language and culture i know . 
  i studied celtic philology briefly . 
  my point is that an independent cornwall is currently only a dream in the minds of a tiny minority , irrespective of how many would like some measure of self-governance . 
  my point was that you ca n't dismiss ni separatism on the basis of popularity or realisability when the map itself is composed of many separatist movements which currently have n't a hope in hell of ever succeeding . 
  it 's not a map of actuality at all . 
  not as such , but there may be a basis for an appeal by a member of the public against legislation on the grounds of constitutionality . 
  having a referendum basically shuts that down by redefining the constitution . 
  cumbric . 
   it would seem they are hardly worth mentioning . 
  and yet we have an independent cornwall on this map . 
  i do n't really see how the union of ireland and northern ireland can be a ` separatist ' ideal when it 's quite the opposite . 
  sinn f\u00e9in might be separatists from a british point of view in that they want ni to leave the uk , but they 're the exact opposite when viewed from ireland itself . 
  unfortunately . 
  the man was corrupt as the day is long and may have taken credit for others people work as well as their money . 
  at least it makes for a decent national holiday . 
  scratch ` high kings ' and replace with everyone and their mams . 
  the d\u00e1lriatta settled in argyll and eventually gave scotland its name ; the d\u00e9isi settled in southern wales ; and just about everyone else went over in search of slaves . 
  it would have been nice if when you have to answer ` other ' for a language spoken at home that they actually give you a chance to say what it is . 
  i 'm just glad they did n't test my dutch . 
  what do they decide based on ? 
  * \u00d3l * is ` to drink ' , ' a drink ' would be * deoch * . 
  they 're all related , that 's why . 
  the [ indo-european ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indo-european_languages ) language family . 
  well yeah , that 's actually fairly common . 
  look at norwegian * akvavit * , polish * okowita * , and french * eau de vie * . 
  ours ( * uisce beatha * to the unaware ) just seems to be exceptional in being an irish transliteration which ended up eventually becoming anglicised as * whiskey * . 
  on a similar note , as i alluded to in the other thread , the irish for beer is literally * be\u00f3ir * however people are far more likely to say * deoch * ( a drink ) when referring to a pint or bottle of beer . 
  i 'm going off wiktionary 's etymology :  from old irish \u00f3l , from proto-celtic * \u0278otlo - from * p\u014dtlo - ( whence also latin p\u014dculum ( `` drinking cup '' ) ) from proto-indo-european * peh \u2083 - . 
  versus  from old norse \u01ebl , from proto-indo-european * h \u2082 elut - ( `` beer '' ) . 
  just as context , * \u00f3l * is the irish verb for * to drink * and not for anything to with beer or ale . 
  that would actually be * deoch * . 
  it actually is a coincidence . 
  scandinavian * \u00f8l * and * \u00f6l * come from a completely different root and meaning to irish * \u00f3l * . 
  not to spoil the joke or anything but it sounds like [ \u026as\u02e0 m\u02b2\u026a\u0283\u0259 ] . 
  there 's no difference between * i * and * me * in irish . 
  * m\u00e9 * and * mise * mean both . 
   \u00daisce is water , \u00faisce beatha is whisky yes , i know . 
  it 's a joke . 
  there 's also no fada in * uisce * or * uisce beatha * . 
  it is , but not all verbs are equal . 
  there 's nothing strictly wrong with using sn\u00e1mh as a verb in its own right , but it sounds weird ( i swam vs. 
  i was swimming ) . 
  edit : plecboy 's on the ball , obviously enough . 
  i do wonder if irish is the only language which has perfectly good verbs that sound awkward as hell to native speakers if you actually use them ( see : * b\u00e1saigh * vs. * faigh b\u00e1s * ) . 
  not trying to snarky or anything , i 'm just always amused by the preference for idioms in irish . 
  in the same way the irish word for water is suspiciously close to ` whiskey ' . 
  to be fair , you covered the basics . 
  i just would n't use * aon * in such a way ; i still have vietnam war flashbacks of my old irish teacher shouting at me for that . 
  however , [ / u/ahsurethatsgrand posted a pretty conscise overview if anyone 's curious . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1ppgob/how_to_say_i_in_various_european_languages/cd4nls3 ) edit : i 'll just point out that * mise * is the emphatic form of * m\u00e9 * : irish has emphatic forms of personal pronouns ( eg . 
  * t\u00fa * becomes * tusa * ) and some ( ? ), 
  contractions ( * liom * becomes * liomsa * ) . 
   t\u00e0 aon \u00f9ll agam there is one apple at me would n't you normally just say ' * t\u00e1 \u00fall agam * : there is [ an ] apple at me ' ? 
  also , how is it you have an accent grave instead of an accent aigu for your fadas ? 
  on that topic : [ irish plantings have been on the up for several decades , with a large private interest ] ( http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/publications/2011/annualreviewandoutlookforagriculturefisheriesandfood20102011/forestry/forestcoverinirelandandtheeu-25/ ), 
  and the 60s , and 70s , and 80s ... ... and the 1880s , if you want to go for the first coining . 
  i know that for irish and uk universities , being an eu citizen is not enough : you must also have been resident in the eu for the previous three years to qualify for lower fees .
