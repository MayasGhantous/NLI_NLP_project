   eboracum ( romans ) - eoforwic ( anglo-saxons ) - jorvik ( danes ) - york ( modern english ) most likely from the brythonic ** iburakon * . 
  it 's still * eabhrac * in irish and * efrog * in welsh , both to do with yew trees . 
  it often sounds to me as though munster speakers merge slender consonant sounds in with the broad dental sounds . 
  so , the ` t ' in * tr\u00e1th * , the ` t ' in * t\u00e9igh * , and the ` t ' in * tae * , whereas they would n't in connacht or ulster irish . 
  this seems to be a matter of accent more than a strict dialectical convention . 
  i understand that , it 's just a pity that many of the munster speakers i 've met * do n't * . 
  again , though , seriously ; the dental pronunciations are weird . 
  typo , i meant ` br\u00f3ig ' , as in connacht irish using forms from different declensions as the nominative ( ? 
  ulster irish is definitely nearly more of a stepping stone to scots gaelic but i 've never , ever understood the hatred for it . 
  and i 've had munster speakers make various disparaging remarks about connacht speakers ( apparently things like ` mr\u00e1 ' , ` c\u00e9ard ' , and ` br\u00f3ig ' are signs of backwardness ) so i 'm hardly inclined to their viewpoint . 
  i 'll be honest , i find ulster irish to be no more difficult than any other dialect . 
  in fact , munster irish speakers annoy the hell out of me with their unwillingness to pronounce dental sounds like everyone else . 
  besides , there 's nothing finer than a ulster accent on a beor . 
  not that i 've encountered . 
  donegal tuesday is an annual cultural event here in galway for that matter . 
   most people from outside the pale usually sing cork 's praises galwegian here , this is news to me . 
  we always joke about corkonians being unable to speak either english ( or irish ) properly . 
  ireland had * extremely * disproportionate representation in westminster , so that was n't really the issue and the troubles * might * have been avoided had the northern irish government not been a sectarian police state perpetuated through a soft apartheid during the 50s and 60s . 
  while i agree with your sentiment , it really was a lot more complicated . 
  try telling that to british and irish unionists in 1913 , they threatened civil war over the possibility of irish home rule ; not even independence !, 
   of the differences they pretend are huge issues this feels a bit strawman-y , who are ` they ' and what are these things that you believe they 're over-exaggerating ? 
  irish and british culture is pretty similar and yet we function just fine as separate states ( and plenty of oddballs feel even today - never mind a century ago - that we are n't distinct enough ) . 
  sure thing , nick griffin . 
  it can be both in english . 
  come on scotland , do whatever your electorate deems to be the most appropriate course of action and we will still visit for your lovely beer and whisky either way . 
  and ireland , and man . 
  are * you * paying enough to * your * ira ? 
  though , in honesty , the rate at which dissident republicans fly through acronyms i would n't surprised if [ traditional ira ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/traditional_ira ) became a thing . 
  i come from an academic background too and i 'm firmly of the opinion that it 's pointless to pretend words do n't have public connotations and then get mad when you 're called out on it . 
  i understand that you did n't mean ` north korean , out-of-touch-with-this-universe level of propaganda ' , and i understood that when i made my original comment , but you do n't seem to get that your comment just is n't going to be seen like that and that is n't necessarily the reader 's fault . 
  ( you ca n't be vague and then blame everyone else ) also , the following line really does you no credit :  people who think propaganda is only and completely a derogatory term are uneducated we were n't having an academic conversation , your original post did n't sound the slightest bit academic . 
  it sounded highly incriminating of a pretty inoccuous image . 
  there are far better , and far less problematic terms than ` propaganda ' . 
  in fact , i do n't thing i 've ever seen the term ` propaganda ' used so loosely in academic sociology or history texts . 
  also , if you do mean propaganda in the way you do , then you 're making an extremely trivial , nearly redundant assertion . 
  of course the eu is trying to make itself look good ... why would n't it want to ? 
   this clearly is some sort of soft propaganda for the eu . 
  like / u/owkuusinen said , the eu countries seem like they have double the stuff going on than the non-members calling it ` propaganda ' is a bit disproportionate to what this is . 
  it 's hardly some malicious , spiteful attempt to actively discredit non-members . 
  of course something commissioned by the eu would focus on eu states . 
  i would n't say none of them were contentious . 
  just because something is n't abortion legislation levels of clusterfuck does n't mean it is n't contentious . 
  and , honestly , the convention did get a pretty wide and free brief otherwise . 
  whether or not anyone acts on these is a separate matter : http://www.thejournal.ie/constitutional-convention-advises-secularism-environmentalism-and-right-to-day-1390601-mar2014/, 
  the following were the areas the convention discussed :  presidential term  voting age  electoral system  right to vote  same-sex marriage  role of women  women in politics  blasphemy  other i would n't call those ` teeny issues ' , though there were plenty of people who unrealistically expected that it would cover everything and anything . 
  since we 're having the referendum on same-sex marriage in less than a year it 's only slightly delayed on expectations . 
  we * did * just have a constitutional convention recently , in fairness . 
  it 's not entirely that bad . 
  and when that bank goes under the german government 's bailout of it will be a kindly donation from hardworking germans to those lazy , ungrateful irish . 
  [ a little bit of japan in rural ireland ] ( https://politonomicsandtravel.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/ireland-223.jpg ) , it 's the japanese gardens in the irish national stud . 
  and , yes , the irish government breeds horses . 
  would a line from crewe to dublin need to have a station at holyhead ? 
  right now the station there serves to connect the dublin ferry with the existing branch line from crewe , having a high-speed train stop there seems redundant since it would n't really be connecting with anything . 
  and yet it does refute some , so your whole ` it 's all legit ' claim is disproven and might mean you would want to be a bit more self-critical about your beliefs . 
  whatever about holding it again , that does n't justify the whole ` results allegedly showed us voting for it ' craic . 
  you have plenty of valid points in there without needing to resort to conspiracy . 
   the results allegedly showed us voting for it . 
  are you honestly implying that the second referendum was rigged ? 
  or nelson 's pillar . 
  we have a chunk of it in the front garden which serves as a bench . 
  is leanbh \u00ed !, 
  depends on where you are , ireland is full of teachers of various levels and qualities , and universities here generally offer diploma-level courses at different stages . 
  elsewhere in europe , it is possible to come across one or the other . 
  the two pictured above are grey squirrels , you know it 's both legal and encouraged to kill grey squirrels in the uk , right ? 
  you 're just not allowed torture them for obvious reasons . 
  it also turns out they only did four grey squirrels and seven stoats . 
  i very much doubt they did for the animals themselves . 
  i know one of the bouncers , he 's pretty much the only reason i 've been in there in the last three years . 
  brewdog may have [ done that already ] ( http://usatthebiglead.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/my-name-is-vladimir.jpg?w=1000 ) . 
   hello , my name is vladimir . 
  i am a beer for uber hetero men who ride horses while topless and carrying knives . 
  i am a beer to mark the 2014 winter olympics . 
  but i am not for gays . 
  love wrestling burly men on the judo mat or fishing in your speedos ? 
  then this is the beer for you !, 
  they also gave 50 % of the profits to lgbt groups , which was nice . 
  ah , now , i 've always felt the front door is a bit of a kip , or at least the clientele are n't very bright . 
  i had some lads ask me in a very confused tone if i was an undertaker because i was wearing an overcoat . 
  that one is like the paragon of peace and idyll in comparison with eyre sq. 
  i do n't know how trinners can just ignore them like that . 
  i used to pop in every so often to use trinity 's archives ( i convinced my own university i needed a research card as an undergrad ) , and i could n't stand the number of tourists i had to fight my way past . 
  where else in the world would a fast food restaurant turn into an impromptu , acapella rave ? 
  shh , we 'll claim it as our own while they 're not looking . 
  used to be the case in ireland under british rule , too . 
  the british police in ireland ( royal irish constabulary ) were also called * peelers * after sir robert peel . 
  i think there are still a few places in the uk that call the police * peelers * , i think that 's the case in northern ireland . 
  hobsbawm is good , but over time i 've found myself agreeing more and more with anthony d. smith 's criticisms of him and ernst gellner , namely that nationalism is not entirely elite-driven and does not necessarily evaporate as the standard of living and political consciousness ` develop ' , so to say . 
  * the ethnic origins of nations * ( 1983 ) is generally given as his best work ( or at least most seminal ) , and it does explore his ideas of pre-modern ethnic communities and provides a tenuous sense of ethnic and national identity not being entirely creations of modernity, 
  as the article says :  from its opening in 1796 until its decommissioning in 1924 it has been , barring the notable exceptions of daniel o'connell and michael collins , a site of incarceration of every significant irish nationalist leader i remember vaguely hearing about short-term internment camps set up after 1916 before they shipped people to frongoch , i must see about that . 
  it 's pretty much a who 's who of 19th-20th century irish nationalism . 
  really ? 
  i find them extremely spacious and comfortable , especially in comparison with various british train lines who insist on limiting legroom and baggage space in favour of crowding people on . 
  plus , getting a table is n't difficult , and it certainly is n't something they charge extra for ( as virgin , for example , seem to ) . 
  plus , if you get res , you can hide them altogether . 
  here 's an exotic one for you , [ a galway hooker in belfast ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/galway_hooker_in_belfast.jpg ) , proof of the reconciliation that has taken place between eu states . 
  or , perhaps , you 'd rather [ order your hooker from a barman ] ( http://fillitorspillit.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/galwayhooker.jpg ) ? 
  he means that a metro does n't have to share with road traffic , which the luas does on some streets but the dart does n't . 
  you should see the inside : [ national library ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/7/6053/6299930752_fe71893142_z.jpg ) - [ national museum ] ( http://www.docbrown.info/docspics/irishscenes/irelandsept2012/p9060541.jpg ) . 
  we will , in time . 
  they 've more or less approved two metro lines ( same gauge as the luas ) and the dart underground .
