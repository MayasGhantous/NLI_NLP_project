  everyone does it , and yet motorists will still insist on revving at traffic lights . 
  how so ? 
  i would prefer to speak irish fluently as a significant number of my friends do , why should i spend that time learning chinese or spanish if i have no intent on using it ? 
  i have nothing against these languages or the people who speak them but irish is a greater priority for me , personally , and i resent being told that i 'd be somehow wasting my time learning it further . 
  i 'm sure you 'd rather every danish person spoke english for economic reasons , but i 'm sure your fellow danes might have other opinions . 
  languages are more than just mere tools of communication for people , they are more than means of furthering your financial opportunities , being imbued with cultural and historic significance . 
  london , of course . 
  i got similar from a woman near birmingham , but she was a full-on telegraph-reading thatcher apologist . 
  things like this always makes me feel somewhat sorry for unionists , they 've really been left behind by the rest of the uk . 
  living in the uk last year , i did find i had to occasionally explain that the troubles were not part of a war between ireland and the uk . 
  the road surface is cracked and uneven ? 
  that will only get worse with weather and traffic , once the road is damaged it gets damaged more easily . 
  considering motorways are designed specifically to handle high volumes of traffic and heavy goods vehicles at high speeds , a damaged road surface is extremely unsafe . 
  holy shit , that 's a motorway ? 
  * you 'd think that it 'd be far better maintained on the belgian side to at least still be * safe * . 
  * i 'm purely talking in terms of road maintenance , not anything silly to do with size , capacity , etc. 
  why is it stupid ? 
  surely then , by your logic , there 's no point speaking danish . 
  it is possible , y' know , to speak two languages . 
  it 's not like speaking irish means you have to abandon english . 
  if i remember correctly , the first peace lines were built by the british army to prevent rioters crossing between neighbourhoods . 
  you could say the exact same about people who 've forgotten their past history . 
   ` the biggest tragedy of english rule in ireland , is that the irish ca n't forget and the english ca n't remember ' - gk chesterton, 
  there 's a whole thing attached to getting guinness in ireland , something about it ` not travelling well ' . 
  in my experience it 's mostly down to barmen being unable to pour it competently or properly maintain the taps . 
  most irish guinness drinkers would have an internal list of pubs that ` do a good guinness ' . 
  guinness have built up a whole thing in their marketing about ` the perfect pint ' and most of it is total nonsense . 
  however , it is ( like a lot of other stouts ) a somewhat more complicated pour than ale or lager , especially the macro-brewery stuff like carlsberg or what have you . 
  if the barman does n't care ( or just thinks that tourists will buy any old shite ) , you may find yourself with a shit pint that has a nasty aftertaste or is totally flat . 
  i once got served a pint of guinness with * no head * which is a sin for almost any stout . 
  considering many tourists come to ireland with the express intent of trying guinness at some point it does come up quite a bit . 
  so you do n't get something poured straight from the bottom of the keg into a plastic cup and get charged upwards of $ 5 for the privilege ? 
  if a publican thinks tourists will buy it for the novelty or the ` irish experience ' , regardless of the actual value , they 'll sell it for as much as they can . 
  also , there are pubs that do a * good * guinness , even though much of the guinness pour is pure myth it is very easy to fuck it up and have it taste mank if the barman does n't care . 
  you might want to clarify what part of those two pretty straightforward sentences you did n't understand . 
  ` do you know the murphys from dublin ? ', 
  ` of course , i go around to them for tea every saturday ', 
  begorrah and be-jesus , i am , aye !, 
  scotland gives you brewdog and you go for the tenants ? 
  you 're missing a real opportunity for decent beer . 
  or , as i 've gotten before , ` you ca n't be irish , you do n't * sound * irish ' ... ... often from people that have never met an irish person before . 
  that sounds horrifying . 
  ` we need people , let 's acquire some ', 
  2/10 trolling , apply yourself . 
  heh , today i learnt . 
   the whole v for victory symbol is basically the same as giving the middle finger here . 
  giving someone two fingers is a totally different gesture to the v for victory sign unless you 're east asian and do it backwards for some reason .

  vindaloo vindaloo na na, 
  [ \u02c8e : \u027e\u02b2\u0259 ] or , to use simple english-style pronunciation : * aerr-uh * . 
  obviously that 's not the exact same as how a native irish speaker would pronounce it since irish has different sounds to english ( the [ \u027e\u02b2 ] sound is n't in any dialect of english i know of ) . 
  english speaker familiar with the name are likely to pronounce it something to extent of * air-ah * . 
  having only lived in ireland , the uk , and france - countries where it 's pretty much expected that pedestrians will do this ( legal or not ) - i ca n't really fathom this at all . 
  i mean , surely the squishy ones should be the ones with legal protection , not the hunks of metal and rubber . 
   for some reason especially brits find jokes about ww2/holocaust/hitler very funny as english soccer fans chant :  ` two world wars and one world cup ! ', 
  i really do n't know why anyone would think that 's an appropriate thing to say unironically , but they do . 
   do be prepared for the `` rounds '' system in pubs . 
  this is common in both ireland and the uk ; if you are with a group of buds , one person will buy everyone a drink , and then when they 're done the next person buys everyone a drink , and so on and so on . 
  not everyone likes this system because you can end up spending a lot more than you intended and you are kind of `` locked in '' to drinking for a while , but try not to leave before you 've bought at least one round . 
  i would clarify that if you 're familiar with everyone , then it is ok to defer your contribution , especially if you have no money at that point in time . 
  generally , we do n't mind buying a pint for someone if they 're broke ; company is preferable to a few euro . 
  also , if you do n't want to get involved in a rounds system , clarify that this is what 's going on and if so , do n't let anyone buy you a round . 
  that may be very difficult to do . 
   a : ` jesus , i 'm dying today '  b : ` how much did you drink last night ? ',

  do you have the exchange heard all-so often here ? 
   a : ` would you like a drink ? ', 
   b : ` ah no , i could n't ; i 've work in the morning '  a : ` just the one ? ', 
   b : ` sure alright , what harm '  [ drinking intensifies ] or , as comedians foil arms and hog put it :  p\u00f3l : ` will you stay for a pint ? ',

  ** do n't ** casually refer to ireland as ` the republic ' or ` the south ' unless you 're specifically differentiating between this country and northern ireland , and never refer to it as * \u00c9ire * unless you also speak irish . 
  ** do ** politely decline anything that 's offered to you ( especially if it 's an offer of a drink ) as it will be offered again if the person is sincere . 
  it 's pretty common to see an exchange like this :  person a : ` will you have a drink ? ', 
   person b : ' i could n't , no , but thanks '  person a : ` are you sure ? ', 
   person b : ` sure , alright . 
  go on , so ' ** do n't ** talk very loudly or over someone else , no one is likely to say anything but rest assured they 're probably annoyed . 
  ** do ** curse as much as you like around people you know , everyone else will , even seven year olds and grandparents , and ** do n't ** be shocked when people use the word ` cunt ' to describe their friends . 
  ** do ** expect complete and total strangers to start a conversation with you , especially about the weather or wherever you 're from and ** do n't ** get too offended if they make insensitive remarks once they learn you 're from elsewhere ; it 's either genuine curiosity or an attempt at humour . 
  if they are a racist , well ... you 've met a total bollox and you 're right in totally ignoring them . 
  ** do n't ** be surprised if locals ca n't pronounce your name or give you a new one . 
  they might even choose a close approximate in irish ; i 've known an anneka renamed * \u00c1ine * and a francesco called * proins\u00edas * . 
  this is more likely in the west . 
  ** do ** say ` thank you ' to the bus driver when you get off . 
  ** do ** ask locals where 's good to drink ( especially if you want to try guinness ) . 
  ** do n't ** blame anyone but yourself if you get charged $ 8 for a pint that you could have gotten for less than $ 4 somewhere else . 
  ** do n't ** get upset if someone appears to be verbally critical or harsh , chances are they 're doing it specifically to see how you react and it probably is n't malicious . 
  ** do n't ** be surprised if you arrange to meet an irish person and they bring their friends , half of their extended family , and their dogs . 
  ** do ** talk about sport or the weather .
