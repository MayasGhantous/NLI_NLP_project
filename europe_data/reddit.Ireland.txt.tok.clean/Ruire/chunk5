  every irish person has an opinion on one or other of these things , even if they do n't know anything about either . 
  the original comment in which your man / u/kuklachev admits to the heinous crime of liking milk is strange in the extreme considering how few people in the world drink milk ( not as rare as drinking water , mind you ) . 
  our noble ulsterman / u/annodominii is perplexed by this unusual and extravagent love ( who likes milk in this day and age ? ), 
  and questions what sort of milk it is that he should love it so much . 
  heh , fair enough , it did feel weird buying an innocuous looking bottle of ale and only later discovering it was from a brewery bought out and ` rationalised ' by greene king . 
  still , it is good that craft beer is catching on and sticking it to them . 
  real ale as in the might-as-well-be-mass-market beer put out by greene king when they 're not shutting down small traditional breweries or actual real ale produced by these small traditional breweries before they get shut down by greene king ? 
  life will kill you eventually , might as well beat it to the punch . 
  i think you may have missed the joke . 
  i 'm really fond of [ silent night , christmas 1915 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt0yso58kxe ) . 
  sure , they got the year wrong ( it was 1914 ) , but it 's a really bittersweet retelling of the christmas truce and the mayhem of wwi . 
  i 'm not really sure what to call it other than vaguely folk even though it 's not readily identifiable as such , or even as irish , but since jerry lynch is involved with the kilfenora c\u00e9il\u00ed band i suppose it does fit . 
  edit : it seems jerry learnt it was 1914 a while ago and updated the lyrics . 
  you can listen to a verse of [ * a silent night christmas 1914 * here ] ( http://www.jerry-lynch.com/music/track9.mp3 ) . 
  i suppose the lyrics are quite fitting for the spirit of this sub :  * we heard a german sing from no man 's land *  * he had a tenor voice so pure and true *  * the words were strange but every note we knew *  * soaring oe ' r the living , dead and damned *, 
  i 'm with ulster bank , and whenever i call their support line i either get put through to someone in northern ireland or to rbs 's line in scotland . 
  you just know they 'll solve your problem as soon as you hear them talk . 
  * ' ( 11th and final line ) . 
  it 's still better than the joyous and wonderful horror of ireland 's call , the unofficial anthem used by the irish rugby team to bridge the divide between ireland and northern ireland . 
  it 's great for rugby but it 's a pretty mediocre and tuneless anthem . 
  now , scotland , there 's a country with a pure decent anthem ( flower of scotland ) . 
  it also works pretty well in all three of their languages . 
  op : land of hope and glory is great , you guys should run with that and confuse the americans who are used to it being played at their graduations . 
  ireland 's call is great for rugby since it 's impossible to sing without sounding drunk or brain-damaged . 
  ` ire-land , irrrreeee-land ! ', 
  land of hope and glory is top notch , i 'd tip it to be the uk 's anthem if ever they did away with god save the dirge . 
  edit : should also note i 've been to parties in rural parts where the dj has played ireland 's call at the end of the night . 
  i was shocked ( a ) that places still the national anthem and ( b ) that they played * that * national anthem . 
  strange thing to behold especially as everyone knew the words . 
   here is a what it looks like . 
  also [ comes in the irish neologism * tacsa\u00ed * ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i7d6f_ryge8/uwrraxy_ssi/aaaaaaaabng/uw0lm9bvhe4/s1600/img_0525.jpg ) which may or may not indicate that the company in question refuses to hire non-irish drivers . 
  as [ has been pointed out elsewhere ] ( http://bocktherobber.com/2013/02/the-true-meaning-of-tacsai-on-our-taxi-signs/ ) a more correct irish coinage would have been * taics\u00ed * and the supporters of * tacsa\u00ed * may not be pushing it to merely highlight their alleged love of the language . 
  did you even follow the link ? 
  only 1.4 % did not reply to the first question and 2.2 % to the second . 
  2013 3rd series poll on support for catalonian independence by ceo : * 54.7 % for * 22.1 % against also , from the same poll : * 48.5 % would prefer an independent state * 21.3 % would prefer a federal state * only 18.6 % would prefer to remain an autonomous community http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_independence#polls, 
  / u/deadthewholetime confirmed for benjen . 
  indeed . 
  except , people conveniently miss the part where cromwell 's campaign lasted a few months , the confederate wars had lasted a decade and had exhausted the resources of ireland . 
  hell , one of the primary reasons the irish confederates were n't able to crush the covenanters and parliamentarians was that they could n't concentrate their forces as manpower and supplies kept ebbing away towards the harvest season . 
  cromwell 's campaign tipped the balance over to utter deprivation but it 's mad to claim that he deliberately butchered hundreds of thousands of people for not converting to protestantism . 
  also , much of the most notorious scorched earth tactics were carried out in the mid 1640s ( several years before cromwell landed in ireland ) by the one-time parliamentarian captain lord inchiquinn , nicknamed ` murrough of the burnings ' for his habit of laying waste to whole townlands . 
  edit : for that matter , henry ireton : cromwell 's son in-law and the man who took over from him in ireland succumbed to the plague as well , so it was hardly the wilful and directed slaughter that / u/bar50cal implied . 
   he had 40 - 50 % of the population killed during the war and after for not converting to protestantism unless cromwell was a master of biological warfare , no . 
  c250,000-500 ,000 people died in ireland ( less than 25 % to 40 % at most ) from diseases and famine caused by * ten years * of warfare from late 1641 to the early 1650s and the last tories being deported . 
  cromwell was often cruel and generally disdainful towards irish catholics , but he never deliberately targeted surrendered civilians . 
  hold on now , this is all pretty fair . 
  if they really wanted to use photography to attack the orange order there are far better images out there like [ this one of orange order hangers-on clashing with police in belfast last july ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2013/7/13/2013713234749802734_20.jpg ) or [ this one of orange order marchers demanding the be let past a police blockade and march through a catholic neighbourhood , also last july ] ( http://www.irishnews.com/picturearchives/1274464/a10p201-01.jpg ) . 
  that 's a big problem with all of these ` words with no direct translation ' since it 's common enough ( and regular practice in english ) just to adopt or adapt these words into your own language . 
  strictly speaking it 's already a loanword of a form since it 's an anglicisation of an irish word . 
  well , that 's not too bad . 
  there 's also fairy trees which , depending on the story , either bring bad luck when cut down or ca n't be cut down at all . 
  i know i 've seen the odd quarry with a single solitary , and usually very old , tree standing in the middle untouched . 
  edit : there 's also the fairy tree [ which obstructed the construction of the n18 ] ( http://www.irelandinpicture.net/2010/04/fairy-tree-that-delayed-motorway-ennis.html ) . 
  halloween/samhain also was n't the only time you had people in costume , st stephen 's day is also known in ireland for the [ wren boys or mummers ] ( http://shadyshamrock.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/wren-boys-st__stephens_day_26_december_in_dingle_co_kerry2.jpg ) who look like they 've been lifted straight from the wicker man . 
  wiccans are a bit like that , but they often insist on mispronouncing the irish names of festivals like samhain and bealtaine . 
  there has to be an argument in there for cultural appropriation . 
  still , it 's nice of them to protest the commercialisation of an event they ca n't pronounce . 
  * - would you like to have sex with me ? 
  ( literally : would you like to hit/strike/meet skin with me ? ), 
  irish is not a particularly romantic language . 
   but it makes no sense that ireland can rank number 1 in equality even though it does not allow abortion or gay marriage to its citizens . 
  it uses economic measures of equality . 
   the crimean referendum was ilegitimate because it was done under duress yes , i agree . 
   we are talking here of a referendum done with freedom of speach and no military coaction all very true . 
  however , that still runs into the issue that it would be a unilateral referendum on secession and a low turnout could interepreted as a lack of recognition of the power of the catalonian government to hold unilateral referenda . 
  just because they are n't being coerced does n't mean that the electorate would still recognise the referendum , and if the electorate do n't recognise it then there are questions of the legitimacy of the outcome . 
  their only hope is to win support abroad . 
  that will be hard to do considering spain is n't the only state with separatist groups . 
  however , it may still be possible considering spain is n't hugely popular abroad . 
  hell , if spain continued to withold negotiations from the catalan government it might undermine the power of the central government by making it look increasingly dictatorial and boosting the popularity of separatists in spain . 
  the catalonian government may be weak , but if it can turn that weakness into an image of political oppression it may work out in their favour . 
   belgium is not a state of autonomies , spain is not belgium , there are more cultures , more languages the organization of the state is different no shit , really ? 
  catalans still give the impression of feeling that their culture and their wellbeing has been neglected by the central government which is more than happy to take their tax revenue . 
  the two issues are related . 
  it recognises them as * regional * languages , co-official only in the regions and not as national languages . 
  this goes back to my original point that the status of flemish is not the same as the status of catalan . 
   a 10 % of the opinion can change in a matter of days . 
  it 's so irresponsible . 
  while i think his point was misguided and mostly wrong , your point here is totally ridiculous . 
  people 's opinions do change over time , yet we still hold referenda and elections anyway . 
  i would say yes . 
  low participation can signal a sense of illegitimacy as well as disinterest . 
  think the crimean referendum which just screams electoral fraud . 
  catalan is only an official language in catalonia , it is not recognised nationally . 
  castillian is the only national language of spain . 
  your point that castillian is spoken by half a billion people outside spain is totally irrelevant to the status of other languages traditionally spoken in spain . 
  i would imagine , though , that if the spanish government keeps prevaricating and pretending that the spanish constitution is a foolproof block on separatism then it stays a possibility . 
  even though only 25 % of the electorate ( much less of the population ) would have voted in favour ? 
  i 'm supportive of catalan independence , but even i 'd say there should be a reasonable minimum threshold ( not something ridiculous like 65 % of the electorate ) for any referendum . 
  i think the logic is more that while catalonia is a net contributer to the rest of spain , they do n't receive the level of cultural recognition and/or political representation that they would like . 
  flemish is a national language of belgium , catalan does n't have the same status . 
   they 'll have to break the law if they 're truly looking for independence from spain , defying spanish law would not be a huge concern , more an inevitability . 
  is irish really dying ? 
  it 's hard to tell when the census questions keep fudging the figures . 
   i 'm not opposed to ulster scots promotion , i just think it should n't be compared to irish maybe not , but linguists do generally class it as a language separate from english . 
  i mean sure it is n't from a completely separate family as irish is but it is a language and it does have a minority status . 
  why should n't it be compared to irish in that regard , politics aside ? 
   still not worse not better either , unless you fancy trying to quantify a war of a few years against decades of intermittent civil war and/or total dictatorship and democide . 
  if nuclear proliferation is n't influential in the rise of proxy wars then it ca n't have anything to do with securing the perceived peace of nuclear states . 
  proxy wars in the 20th century are an offshoot of mad , channeling strategic interests into expanding spheres of influence rather than direct conflict .
