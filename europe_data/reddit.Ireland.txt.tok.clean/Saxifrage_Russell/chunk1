  ( irish ), 
  here lads i thought it was supposed to get warmer . 
  so edgy . 
  so edgy . 
  that 's one of the most irish usernames i 've ever seen . 
  well done lad . 
  we 're not red or rich ... what the hell . 
  apparently they provide water and sewage services in scotland . 
   why are the irish so ...  good at bed [ good dental hygeine ] ( http://cdn.chud.com/5/57/1000x1000px-ll-5746735e_screenshot-lrg-07cr.jpeg ), 
  wow you just left us out . 
  it 's not even in our autocomplete for feck 's sake . 
  when england tries to secede we 're going to re-enact the us civil war . 
  i want to join this , but it looks like there are so few nations left i would n't be able to pick anything . 
  i do n't even want them to join us , i do n't think i could handle the amount of smug on gerry adams face . 
  i 'm not disagreeing with you , i 'm just saying that might by why many older people are voting to leave . 
  they 've seen firsthand how the eu has progressed over their lifetimes and do n't like the direction it 's headed ? 
  oh , we blame merkel too . 
  irish here , we mostly blame the english . 
  what the hell man . 
  nobody anywhere in this thread is talking about anything to do with nationality or ethnicity . 
  seriously what are you even talking about ? 
   \\  at least this time the man who committed this act lived . 
      the one in berlin ( christmas market ) did too and escaped to italy where ** he was shot ** . 
  umm ... 
  how much you wan na bet ? 
   wittgenstein eh can i get a tl ; dr please, 
   ill sure follow your account for a few days you are a strange and weird dude . 
  what if you had to pass a civics test to be allowed to vote ? 
  i guess the usa still is n't a democracy today because convicts cant 's vote . 
   dictatorship with one eligible member - the dictator - are democracies . 
  you 're being intentionally obtuse . 
  edit : oxford is generally considered the most reputable english dictionary , which is why i went to them first . 
   a system of government by the whole population ** or all the eligible members ** of a state , typically through elected representatives . 
  wtf is an argie, 
  do n't be absurd . 
  universal suffrage has never been a requirement of democracy . 
  `` joined '', 
  ira are bunch of fucking commies . 
  step one is not calling them scum . 
  phase, 
  why you mad tho . 
  ehhh i do n't want to have to learn german . 
  who is this guy and what does he do ? 
  i thought merkel was basically eu president . 
  constantinople looks nice these days . 
  implying religious fanatics do things only for rational reasons . 
   they probably would n't want to . 
  hamas is very clear in their desire for genocide . 
  who let you out of / pol / ? 
  seriously it 's not like current national borders have existed for thousands of years or anything . 
  and them hamas smuggles in a nuke . 
  never put all your eggs in one basket . 
  then explain how i can play as lithuania in the 1444 start in euiv . 
  ask your english teacher about correct comma usage next chance you get - you 'll want to have that nailed down before you start high school . 
  wow that 's a pretty rude way to talk to somebody . 
  filibuster baby, 
  we 'll see about that . 
  stop, 
  you 're saying i 'm the problem in this conversation ? 
  really ? 
   but being here is a first step to share and learn our culture and mindset . 
  i honestly hope you 're right , and that the current troubles are just growing pains that will settle in a generation or two . 
  but when many of the people carrying out attacks in the west are second or third generation immigrants who have lived their whole lives here , it makes me fear that our current integration methods are failing , and that this problem will persist for a long time to come . 
  why are you so angry and hostile ? 
  that 's not how you have a productive discussion about anything , let alone politics . 
  why is more people having a swedish passport something to celebrate ? 
  if it does n't mean shared culture and mindset , it 's just a bureaucratic detail . 
   spotted the dub . 
  is the gaa even popular with 20-somethings ? 
  i 've never had an interest in it and i ca n't recall ever hearing any of my friends talk about it . 
  obviously that 's anecdotal , i 've just generally had the impression of gaa as something followed mostly by culchies and aul fellas . 
   so my best advice would be to come see for yourself !, 
  haha , i 'm irish , born and raised in dublin . 
  i ask because i 'm having a hard time pinpointing what aspects of our culture are distinctly `` irish '' , and not `` european culture '' or `` anglosphere culture '' or `` british isles culture '' . 
  all the quaint auld stuff like irish language , dances , trad music etc would count , i suppose , but i do n't personally care for that stuff much or encounter it much day-to-day , and i would n't judge the success of an immigrant 's integration by whether they like trad music and speak irish - i do n't !, 
  honest question : what is `` irish culture '' ? 
   independence & joining the eu you 're funny . 
  as a web developer , i just ignored the stupid law . 
  was it even enforced ? 
   ( you could also make the sunlight is the best disinfectant argument ) while this argument is true , and while i am generally a consequentialist , i find it distasteful to have to resort to consequentialist arguments to defend basic human rights . 
  criminalizing speech is just so cartoonishly evil that i become indignant at even having to make such arguments . 
  hahahaha , and here we see the regressive lefty scurry away when he realizes he 's lost the argument !, 
  a common occurrence online to be sure , and wonderful to witness every time !, 
  ooh ooh , please tell me who 's liberty is being infringed upon by an idiot denying the holocaust . 
  hey frenchie , ever heard of something called libert\u00e9 ? 
  okay . 
  no , it 's freedom of speech . 
  do you seriously not understand that the only reason freedom of speech is an important legal concept is to protect people who are saying things most people find offensive , stupid , or disgusting ? 
  like if all you 're saying is how much you like apple pie you do n't need freedom of speech . 
   this is not about freedom of speech explain to me how the criminalization of certain speech is not about freedom of speech . 
   because ideas and opinions are n't debated in some grand forum in which everyone spectates and then pick the side they agree with . 
  that 's literally what you 're doing right now . 
  wow rude, 
  wow , what a fantastic argument , i 'm convinced . 
  of course . 
  free speech does not imply a right to be taken seriously . 
  i 'm not sure what you think freedom of speech is , but as it is generally conceived it most certainly gives you the right to say things that are historically inaccurate . 
  maybe , it 's hard to tell on the internet .
