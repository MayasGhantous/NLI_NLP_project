i do n't think so ... it was n't snowing in the movie , was it ? 
  ( have n't seen it in a while ), 
  will resist the urge to make a reference to `` in bruges '' , because that really does look impressive . 
  maybe i did grow up on a farm , and am retarded ( damnit ), 
  / u/nitoko brought up sjws in a thread about social justice . 
  he 's either derailing , or sees a concrete link . 
   that coming from a swede is a compliment . 
  a country rampaging with political correctness and radical feminism ( from another of your posts here ) . 
  if you somehow think sweden needs to meaningfully change its social outlook you are not ok with the definition of social justice in this context . 
   my original post was ironic . 
  so , you are pro social justice , and are , in fact , upset bulgaria ranks near the bottom ? 
  this index measures social justice . 
  that you are glad bulgaria ranks near the bottom ** clearly ** indicates a problem with social justice . 
  complaining about `` sjws '' is an absolute strawman . 
  yeah , maybe i am being too cynical ... checks / u/nitoko 's profile for recent comments nop , guy seriously believes social justice is a threat to society . 
  `` the social justice index is composed of the following six dimensions : poverty prevention , equitable education , labor market access , social cohesion and non-discrimination , health as well as intergenerational justice . '', 
  yeah , who wants those things for their country ? 
   i think at this point there wo n't be a currency union . 
  there seems to be no appetite in the rest of the uk for it at all : thus i think it would be electoral suicide for any government that proposed it and it would obviously be something that would be a major part of the next uk general election campaign . 
  if there 's a yes vote , i think gerry holtham sums up why i really think there will be a currency union better than i can : http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-29197302 once there 's a fundamental change , red lines are n't necessarily so red any more . 
   obviously , ruk have ruled out a currency union . 
  ruk have said they would n't agree to a currency union . 
  there is regularly a wide gulf between what politicians say they will or wo n't do , and what they actually end up doing . 
  scotland is holding plenty with which to negotiate as well, 
  [ might want to hold off on this then ] ( http://metro.co.uk/2012/04/04/scottish-archery-fans-can-relax-in-york-as-archaic-laws-face-axe-375726/ ), 
  the official names of the two countries on the island of ireland are northern ireland , and [ ireland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_the_irish_state ) . 
  the 26 counties are commonly referred to as the republic of ireland , but that is n't the official name . 
   finland borders russia, 
   so , for all intents and purposes , the easter rising proclamation is our declaration of independence and as such is out independence day . 
  i have no problem with the proclamation being referred to as / likened to a declaration of independence . 
  but in no practical sense is 28th april an treated as an independence day in ireland . 
  i 've never heard of easter as being an independence day in ireland . 
  people do commemorate the easter rising , but in the same way the commemorate the 1798 rising . 
  really , ireland does n't have an independence day . 
  we make do with st patricks day i guess . 
  i would assume the police were telling them not to stay in that area , to `` move '', 
  see also : various british governments/irish people/australia, 
  pretty sure your place is n't syrup sipper . 
  ^ only ^ kidding ^ i ^ live ^ in ^ ottawa, 
   that is because governments do n't have a choice to cease offering a service when it 's unprofitable , dangerous or difficult . 
  it does n't mean public sector workers do n't need protection . 
  you make good points . 
   the rules are just different are they different though ? 
  do n't public sector unions operate in basically the same way as private sector unions , except with much more carrot , and much less stick ? 
  is it hypocritical of me that i support completely the advancement of private sector unions , but am much more lukewarm in my endorsement of public sector unions ? 
  on the one hand , i feel like i am being hypocritical because public sector employees are taking my/all taxpayers money , instead of the money of some faceless corporations . 
  but on the other hand , i do feel that public sector unions/workers really do n't have the same controls acting on them . 
  their employers ( governments ) for the most part do n't have the same requirements of being financially viable/efficient . 
  none of what you say amounts to spying . 
  most of what you say basically amounts to `` us government sources say that edward snowden should not have released us government documents '' . 
  absolutely groundbreaking statements . 
  edward snowden had to flee what would have amounted to persecution after he blew the whistle . 
  he did n't have many options on destination countries . 
  will the russian government have tried to grill snowden ? 
  possibly , i do n't know . 
  have they learned anything useful from this ? 
  possibly , i do n't know . 
  and you do n't either . 
  and your statement that snowden is spying on the us remains nonsensical, 
   how is that not spying ? 
  which part ? 
   released classified us documents to hostile nations he came to the conclusion that they spying they were doing was unjustifiable . 
  so he whistleblew . 
  not spying . 
   now he 's shilling for putin on russian tv ummm , not spying . 
  how do you consider any of the above spying ? 
  how is giving edward snowden ( a man who is famous/infamous only for exposing the depth of us electronic snooping ) asylum equate to being `` in favor of spying '' ? 
   so obviously it 's not the same thing . 
  in practical terms , it is . 
  similarly if you are a government minister , and your prime minister asks you to resign , he/she is n't really asking . 
  in other news , edward snowden applies to extend his stay in russia . 
  not going to happen , but i would * love * if germany offered snowden asylum in response to this row . 
   you must either share it with friends needing roommates is n't particularly strange even for those in many countries who earn more than minimum wage, 
  [ i had to find it , that is pretty terrible ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nconszv--z0 ), 
  what is the blue area in south america ? 
   because the country they went to to do the reuniting is also a country that gives the most welfare . 
  no , because the country they went to to do the reuniting is also * the country most likely to do the reuniting * ( assist in bringing family members to the country * legally * ) . 
  did you even read the original post you replied to ? 
  or you just wanted an anti-refugee rant ? 
   as far as i 've heard , they 're able to get a reunion almost instantly in sweden , while in denmark they have to wait a year just for the possibility of a reunion . 
  which of the multiple safe countries they passed through would have done that ? 
   it 's ok for them to want what 's best for them , but if you want what 's best for you , you 're racist two points : a ) `` what 's best for them '' in this instance is reunifying their family . 
  i just want to make sure you know that 's what you 're rallying against . 
  b ) if you think what 's best for you is less of ` them ' ... well , i 'm sure you can work it out . 
  you seem like a smart person . 
  you did n't answer my question :  reuniting families : `` seeking economic benefits '' . 
   how is a desire to reunite your family somehow evidence of not being a legitimate refugee ? 
  reuniting families : `` seeking economic benefits '' . 
  how is a desire to reunite your family somehow evidence of not being a legitimate refugee ? 
   europeans want to keep their countries and cultures intact so their children can have a good future ? 
  tl ; dr you paraphrased `` 14 words '' to explain how you 're not racist, 
  i disagree . 
  there is a really important difference between people not being able to get the latest iphone when it comes out ( or having to pay a lot more ) for a few years and there being food shortages . 
   however there are many food exporters , so one can simply swap to another . 
  that 's simply not true . 
  i 'm just going to copy/paste my previous reply , because you either did n't read it or did n't understand it , because you did n't reply to it  define easily . 
  there is n't a glut on the food markets where other large international suppliers can take up the demand of the eu that was supplied by another large international supplier ( which was providing double digits percentage of a food stuff ) , without scaling up their own operations ( time frame : years , optimistically )  link : http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/trade-analysis/statistics/graphs/top-5-imported-products-2013_en.pdf[1]  if we lost domestic food production , and if the eu ever displeased either brazil or argentina ( or obviously the us ) , we 'd have a really bad time . 
   unless you depend on one country specifically , they do n't have leverage . 
  what do you mean by `` specifically '' ? 
  if a country has a large portion ( double digits percentage ) of the imports of a commodity they have huge leverage .
