  that 's why i pointed out the difference between correctness and accuracy . 
  ... well the whole argument is semantics ( the branch of linguistics concerned with meaning )  maybe english is different in this matter but polish means something was polish , and when you want to say something was in poland yo usay something was in poland . 
  maybe that 's the root of this issue , english certainly is different . 
  irish can absolutely refer to location/occurrence in ireland without inferring ownership/responsibility . 
    ` american terrorist attack ' is a little different , as it is describing the terrorists as being american . 
   and by the same very logic , term `` polish death camps '' could describe the death camps as polish institution if you 're describing a physical entity that has a single location , in this case poland , it 's valid to describe it as polish . 
  the same does n't apply to a person . 
  nobody would say german or russian soldiers fighting in poland were polish soldiers . 
   oh , i do find a fault in jumping to conclusions prematurely . 
   which is precisely where lies the problem with allowing misleading terms such as `` polish death camps '' to be spread without opposing reaction . 
  your second statement does not logically follow your first statement if , as you say , you find fault with jumping to conclusions prematurely , why are you not arguing against those who prematurely jump to the conclusion that the term `` polish '' is intended to mean responsibility/ownership , and not location ? 
  many words in english have several meanings . 
  your `` intended meaning '' was in no way obvious , and that 's fine . 
  nobody is at fault for using a word or phrase that has more than one possible meaning , or for inferring one meaning and not another . 
   it should be ** correct ** : ( emphasis mine ) . 
  ` correct ' is more or less binary , something is either correct or it is n't . 
  ` cuban detention camp ' is correct , in that it is a detention camp in cuba . 
  now , obviously a more useful term would be ... american detention camp . 
  but that in no way makes ` cuban ' incorrect . 
  ` american terrorist attack ' is a little different , as it is describing the terrorists as being american . 
  i do n't see another interpretation here . 
  ` american terror attack ' would be correct though . 
  ... funny how language allows for your statement to have been misinterpreted through no fault either of us ? 
  it does n't , people ca n't accept that in english a word can have two different , but equally valid interpretations, 
  it 's not lying . 
  it 's a word having two meanings , one of which is quite accurate . 
  polish in this context does not imply responsibility for , just location of . 
  to describe the potato famine as `` the irish potato famine '' in no way implies irish people were responsible for causing it . 
   you ca n't pin death camps on either poland or poles nobody is doing that in this page . 
  if something is in poland , in english it can , quite accurately , be described as polish . 
  someone else made the accurate comparison to the french vichy government . 
  in that example , `` french '' has no implication other than it was in france . 
   can you guarantee that of course not . 
  that 's not how language works . 
  anyone looking for guarantees for interpretations are going to be disappointed  people not knowledgeable about the history of this part of the world who are these people who do n't have the lightest grasp of the events of ww2 ? 
  why would anyone care what someone so obviously ignorant thought ? 
   these guys counted on that no one in fact can : really ? 
  you think nobody can make that distinction ? 
  `` polish '' does not mean `` owned by polish people '' . 
  i bought polish sausage last week , i have no expectation that anyone in poland benefited from the transaction . 
  [ 115 units ] ( https://youtu.be/5inlewnkw4s ), 
  and in terms of all ireland titles , london are more successful then my home county wicklow in both hurling and football, 
   were crusades/jihads related wars ( the initial ones , not the retaliations ) to defend religious brothers ? 
  ... yes if that 's how you want to see it ? 
  my understanding is the byzantine emperor requested help against turkish expansion . 
  the pope responded by calling the first crusade . 
  ultimately with any war you can argue it is based on simple humanity ( `` fight for your people '' ) , or lofty concepts ( `` fight for god/nation '' ) depending on your motives . 
  both fighting for god for god and fighting for flag are equally dumb . 
  look after your family , look after your friends , look after yourself . 
  or become a professional soldier , and fight for the money . 
  but do n't pretend fighting for a flag is any more justifiable than fighting for a god . 
  concepts like god and nationality are absolutely intangible, 
  you 're not comparing like with like at all . 
  i 've already addressed this . 
  you 're comparing an intangible concept to very tangible people . 
  religion | nationalism ----- | ----- you fight for $ diety ( intangible ) | you fight for your country/flag ( intangible ) you defend your religious brothers ( tangible ) | you defend your countrymen ( tangible ) compare apples to apples , not apples to some concept you disagree with . 
   we may not have the same values you suggest those you share a nationality with may not share values , are n't those you share a religion with more likely to share at least some values with you ? 
   but we are united would n't those sharing a religion be equally ( if not moreso ) ` united ' ? 
  in response to my statement , to which you originally responded , `` dying for your country is as dumb as dying for your religion '' : how do you argue there is any more justification for fighting for a flag , than there is for fighting for a religion ? 
  defending your friends and family is justified . 
  killing/dying for territorial integrity/national identity is no more sensible than killing/dying for a bunch of otherworldy virgins . 
  you lose property , you can get more property . 
  you die , you do n't get more lives . 
   dying to defend countrymen / = / dying for god ? 
  is dying to defend countrymen = dying for ` religious brothers ' ? 
  why not ? 
  why because you share a passport with someone should you kill other people on their behalf ? 
  i can understand fight to defend ones family and friends . 
  if they are able to leave a conflict zone , fighting for a flag is no better than fighting for a cross . 
  * if you could hear , at every jolt , the blood * * come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs , * * obscene as cancer , bitter as the cud * * of vile , incurable sores on innocent tongues , * * my friend , you would not tell with such high zest * * to children ardent for some desperate glory , * * the old lie ; dulce et decorum est * * pro patria mori . 
  * ( dulce et decorum est pro patria mori : it is sweet and good to die for your country ) . 
  dying for your country is as dumb as dying for your religion . 
  `` register everybody and take pictures . '', 
  by everybody do you mean everybody or just muslims ? 
   yes , and your example is only valid if you assume that 20 + % of the non-targets are n't terrorists . 
  it is in no way unreasonable to assume at least a minority are not terrorists . 
  that is completely different to assuming 80 + % are terrorists . 
  if you do n't understand this , you should maybe take a statistics/probability class . 
   we do n't know anything about the people killed with the targets . 
  for all we know they were all terrorists . 
  since we do n't know , your example does n't work here . 
  did you read what i said ? 
  it addresses this point exactly the assumption ca n't be that anyone standing near a target is also a terrorist . 
  so / u/gibemoneipl0x is still wrong ( `` i 'd rather see 10 jihadis and 1 innocent person killed than see those same 10 jihadis kill 100 innocent people '' ) ... unless you assume 80 + % of the non-target kills * are * terrorists, 
  not at all 1 jihadi and 9 other people killed by drones . 
  the assumption ca n't be that anyone standing near a target is also a terrorist . 
  so / u/gibemoneipl0x is still wrong ( `` i 'd rather see 10 jihadis and 1 innocent person killed than see those same 10 jihadis kill 100 innocent people '' ) ... unless you assume 80 + % of the non-target kills * are * terrorists, 
   and the assumption ca n't be that anyone standing near a target is not also a terrorist . 
  that 's why i said  i should n't have said innocent people . 
  other people would have been a more accurate term . 
   they could have been other terrorists that simply were n't targets . 
  i should n't have said innocent people . 
  other people would have been a more accurate term . 
  maybe they were terrorist , maybe they were friends and family . 
  the assumption ca n't be that anyone standing near a target is also a terrorist , but even if the argument was made that they were , there is no certainty that even a simple majority of people killed by drones are terrorists . 
   any proof on this ? 
  look at any guerilla campaign . 
  the killing of civilians by the dominant power drives support towards the insurgent group, 
   i 'd rather see 10 jihadis and 1 innocent person killed than see those same 10 jihadis kill 100 innocent people unfortunately the real world numbers are more like 1 jihadi and 9 ~ ~ innocent ~ ~ other people killed by drones . 
   people might vote out just to spite the conservatives and cameron .
