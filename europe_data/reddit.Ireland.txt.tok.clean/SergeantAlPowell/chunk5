  if conservatives and cameron do n't get meaningful concessions from the eu , will they be on the stay side or the go side ? 
  exponential growth is the increase in a quantity according to the law . 
  for a parameter and constant where is the exponential function and is the initial value . 
  to a point , yes . 
  politicians would like to nudge numbers in their favour . 
  but such an argument would require a ) evidence that this is happening now b ) evidence that this was n't happening before ( if it 's being argued as proof things are worse now than they were before ), 
   there will no way be around the apprenticeship , no politician would touch that . 
  the companies i mentioned are n't arguing that the refugees should be allowed to work , not that they should be allowed to bypass training requirements . 
  give them permits to work , and let them then undertake the same training as others . 
  you should take that up with ingo kramer of the national union of employers ' federations '' ... there are many companies desperately seeking people for job training . '' http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11675380/germany-industry-chiefs-call-for-jobs-for-asylum-seekers.html or employers like dp or daimler : `` last week , big employers including deutsche post and the automaker daimler called for an overhaul of german labor laws to let asylum-seekers get to work quickly . '', 
  you 're arguing there is a serious unemployment problem in germany at the moment ? 
  ok . maybe get out and see what actual unemployment looks like . 
  i am old enough to have worked in 3 of the 4 decades i 'm referring to . 
  may i ask how that is relevant ? 
   the numbers are fake . 
  unemployed people are sent back to schools and schooling centers and other training measures which makes them drop out of the official statistics . 
  the whole system is fake and meant to hide reality . 
  yes , of course there 's actually a super serious unemployment problem in germany at the moment , in comparison to the 00s , or 90s , or 80s , or 70s jog on . 
  of course automation is going to grow productivity , and most likely lead to people working less . 
  that 's a good thing . 
  it 's also a good thing that it 's going to happen gradually , as it has been since the 1960s ( or before ) those arguing there will be some paradigm shift in the next couple of decades are not grounded in reality, 
   you should get used to not having to work because that really is the future . 
  humanity should . 
  i should not . 
  it 's not happening in my working lifetime . 
  i 'm not saying it is n't going to be a good thing , but if you are waiting for it to happen in the next 40 years , you 'll be sorely disappointed . 
  40 years ago in germany there was 4 % unemployment . 
  today in germany there is 4 % unemployment . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/germany/unemployment-rate ) . 
  for that time , people have been saying we 're going to see more unemployment in the < x small number of years  because of automation . 
  yes , eventually we 'll see humanity mankind working a 4 day week because of increased productivity , but it 's not going to happen in my lifetime . 
  40 years, 
  and yet we still import workers for manufacturing . 
  things are more automated , and we are making more things . 
  `` 10 more years and nobody needs humans for that line of work anymore '' people were saying this 40 years ago . 
  people will still be saying it 40 years from now, 
  which in real terms is also approx 0 % growth for usa/china there 's a reason growth in one country is n't compared to other countries with bigger economies, 
   by population ? 
  by gdp per capita ? 
  i think any fair distribution would have to attache equal importance to both , not one or the other . 
   he has his weaknesses , ( weak on trident . 
  weak on immigration ) weak on all international issues, 
   you do n't need to spell anything out . 
  and yet , you 're still trying to stay off topic ? 
  k , we 're done here . 
  feel free to reply with content relevant to * this thread * ( except we both know you wo n't , so goodbye ), 
  i am going to spell this out in as simple language as i can . 
  * [ this thread is about the fact that red states get more federal funding ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vmzbk47.png ) ( i 'd kind of appreciate if you can acknowledge that you at least understand these point by point , cos you seem to be having trouble somewhere . 
  i 'd like to narrow down exactly where that is . ), 
  did you understand the first one ? 
  * this thread is not about you cherrypicking parts of us federal funding , in order to bolster an argument you already lost . 
  ... did you understand that ? 
  it seems like that 's the one you 're not really getting . 
  let me try to help : #we 're talking about overall dependency on government not just food stamps , as i have clarified several times just to clarify , here 's the post you have failed to respond to with any substance even once : ------------------ ( your poor attempt at changing the subject in an argument you 've lost ) ignores state government dependency on federal funding . 
  additionally , it does n't show which states are ** net contributors ** to the federal government and which are ** net recipients ** see my link for all this information : https://wallethub.com/edu/states-most-least-dependent-on-the-federal-government/2700/ individual dependency : overall return on taxes paid to the federal government ( this includes food stamps and all other federal funding ) state government dependency : federal funding as a percentage of state revenue the link i provided clearly shows that red states are disproportionately at the top of the net recipients of federal spending : see the main findings table . 
  of the top 10 ( again we 're looking at the top , not the bottom ) , of the list of combined dependency ( both state and individual ) on the federal government , 7 are red states , 2 are competitive states and 1 is a blue state . 
  i 'll repeat what you said was a `` common myth ''  just like red states in the us get the ** most federal funding ** , yet are always voting for `` small government . '', 
  i 'd ask for any source that shows this to be a myth . 
  red states get more federal funding than blue states . 
  i 've given you a source that quite clearly shows this . 
  your source does nothing to dispute this . 
  so , again , i 'd ask for any source/data to back up your `` common myth '' argument . 
  if it 's just empty rhetoric , that 's fine too , i just want to be sure . 
  ------------------------------ do you have anything * on-topic * to add ? 
  or are we done here ? 
  i read your post . 
  it was n't nearly as clever as you thought . 
  you managed 4 on topic characters out of 1346 before veering off on an unrelated tangent about the opposite end of the table and ... all of this is irrelevant , *** because we 're talking about overall dependency on government not just food stamps , as i have clarified several times . 
  *** ( maybe the capitalised , embolded and italicised text will help , in case you missed it a couple of times ) . 
  you could make a substantive reply , but i understand if that 's beyond you edit in case you forgot that time you said it was a common myth that red states `` get the most federal funding '' : http://i.imgur.com/vmzbk47.png ( it 's not ) do you have anything of substance here ? 
  you 're sounding like an empty vessel full of broken records . 
  so if you want to make a substantive reply , i 'm glad to do the same . 
  except we both know you wo n't because your argument is nonsense . 
  did n't think so . 
  all of this is irrelevant , ** because we 're talking about overall dependency on government not just food stamps , as i have clarified several times . 
  ** ( maybe the capitalised , embolded text will help , in case you missed it a couple of times ) . 
  you could make a substantive reply , but i understand if that 's beyond you, 
   i have n't replied to the meat of your comments because i 'm too busy with empty rhetoric to back up my `` common myth '' argument ftfy . 
  got it, 
   believe it or not , of those 10 states we listed earlier , six make the bottom 13 ( top 13 if you 're looking at the chart , bottom 12 by your phrasing ) . 
   i 'm no math genius , but i think it refers to 1 of something in 12 of something else . 
  as before : you 're seriously arguing you did n't look at it backwards because you said `` 1/12 '' ( count em , 4 characters ) ? 
  honestly , just because you make a 4 character reference to something as above ... k all of this is irrelevant , because we 're talking about overall dependency on government not just food stamps , as i have clarified several times . 
  ( maybe the uppercase will help , in case you missed it a couple of times ) . 
  you could make a substantive reply , but i understand if that 's beyond you, 
  you 're welcome to actually reply to what i said , so far you 've have nothing but mischaracterising statistics that tell half the picture and empty rhetoric . 
  i welcome a substantive reply , but i have no confidence i 'll get it . 
  in case you missed it , here 's the comment you have n't replied to : -------------------- the table you 're using in that is only looking at food stamps , which is one part of overall federal government spending . 
  ( you 're also looking at the table ass backwards , you 're examining the bottom 13 , when the claim being made is about the top of the table . 
  this would seem like a non-sequitur . 
  but again , since it does n't relate to overall federal spending , which is what we 're talking about here , that 's irrelevant ) . 
  it also ignores state government dependency on federal funding . 
  additionally , it does n't show which states are ** net contributors ** to the federal government and which are ** net recipients ** see my link for all this information individual dependency : overall return on taxes paid to the federal government ( this includes food stamps and all other federal funding ) state government dependency : federal funding as a percentage of state revenue the link i provided clearly shows that red states are disproportionately at the top of the net recipients of federal spending : see the main findings table . 
  of the top 10 ( again we 're looking at the top , not the bottom ) , of the list of combined dependency ( both state and individual ) on the federal government , 7 are red states , 2 are competitive states and 1 is a blue state . 
  i 'll repeat what you said was a `` common myth ''  just like red states in the us get the ** most federal funding ** , yet are always voting for `` small government . '', 
  i 'd ask for any source that shows this to be a myth . 
  red states get more federal funding than blue states . 
  i 've given you a source that quite clearly shows this . 
  your source does nothing to dispute this . 
  so , again , i 'd ask for any source/data to back up your `` common myth '' argument .
