  if it 's just empty rhetoric , that 's fine too , i just want to be sure . 
   what does the 1/12 refer to ? 
  the post you linked hat 1346 characters . 
  you 're seriously arguing you did n't look at it backwards because you said `` 1/12 '' ( count em , 4 characters ) ? 
  reread , you focus on the bottom of the list . 
   but again , since it does n't relate to overall federal spending , which is what we 're talking about here , that 's irrelevant ) . 
  i 'm sure you 're going to respond to my comment some time soon . 
  edit : nvm , i 've lost any confidence you have anything more than empty rhetoric . 
  i can only ask for a substantive response so many times . 
   of course infrastructure can be a desired outcome again , not it 's not . 
  infrastructure exists to serve purposes . 
  those purposes are the desired outcome . 
  you 're coming at this argument completely sideways , you seem to be of the completely mistaken opinion that i 'm against infrastructure spending ? 
  i never said anything to suggest that  you seem to think infrastructure is a fancy term for ` road ' . 
  no i do n't . 
  i gave a couple of simple , non definitive examples . 
  you can make whatever projections you want from that , but that 's you , not me . 
   let me guess ... alberta ? 
  you do n't really need to guess , my current location is n't that much of a secret : https://www.reddit.com/user/sergeantalpowell/submitted/, 
   hiring someone to do a job at market rate is not giving them a subsidy . 
  subsidy/investment are not as well differentiated as you might think . 
  the difference can be subjective what to the government body in charge of the funding may be `` investment '' may be seen as a subsidy to other governments unless there are absolutely no barriers to who can be hired . 
  are eu construction contracts open to companies from anywhere in the world ? 
  then the argument can absolutely be made that they are indeed subsidies for eu companies . 
   they 're for infrastructure that makes no sense . 
  infrastructure is a means to an end , not a goal in and of itself , to allow better delivery of good and service for businesses and individuals , and better transportation in general for businesses and individuals . 
  indeed , if building infrastructure for the sake of it * was * the end goal , it would not be investment , and would be simply subsidising local business . 
  of course businesses employ people . 
  the point i was responding to was that businesses did n't benefit from structural funding, 
  obviously businesses will employ people . 
  my point was in reply to the comment that suggested that structural funding does n't benefit businesses, 
  the table you 're using in that is only looking at food stamps , which is one part of overall federal government spending . 
  ( you 're also looking at the table ass backwards , you 're examining the bottom 13 , when the claim being made is about the top of the table . 
  this would seem like a non-sequitur . 
  but again , since it does n't relate to overall federal spending , which is what we 're talking about here , that 's irrelevant ) . 
  it also ignores state government dependency on federal funding . 
  additionally , it does n't show which states are ** net contributors ** to the federal government and which are ** net recipients ** see my link for all this information individual dependency : overall return on taxes paid to the federal government ( this includes food stamps and all other federal funding ) state government dependency : federal funding as a percentage of state revenue the link i provided clearly shows that red states are disproportionately at the top of the net recipients of federal spending : see the main findings table . 
  of the top 10 ( again we 're looking at the top , not the bottom ) , of the list of combined dependency ( both state and individual ) on the federal government , 7 are red states , 2 are competitive states and 1 is a blue state . 
  i 'll repeat what you said was a `` common myth ''  just like red states in the us get the ** most federal funding ** , yet are always voting for `` small government . '', 
  i 'd ask for any source that shows this to be a myth . 
  red states get more federal funding than blue states . 
  i 've given you a source that quite clearly shows this . 
  your source does nothing to dispute this . 
  so , again , i 'd ask for any source/data to back up your `` common myth '' argument . 
  if it 's just empty rhetoric , that 's fine too , i just want to be sure . 
   not to an outsider . 
  not to someone interested in facts and sources . 
  ftfy . 
  from what you 've written so far , i think you 're less informed about the us government than many outsiders   government resources are concentrated where people are concentrated . 
  your point being ? 
   low population density states skew red . 
  again ... 
  what point were you making in saying `` government resources are concentrated in densely populated areas for reasons of efficiency '' ? 
  since it 's entirely logical to concentrate resources aimed at helping people where people are concentrated i 've given you a source showing the states that are most dependent on the federal government . 
  so i ask again , do you have ** any ** source to show that red states in the us getting the most federal funding per-capita is a `` common myth '' ? 
  or just empty rhetoric ? 
  nothing you 've said disputes what was written :  red states in the us get the most federal funding , yet are always voting for `` small government . '', 
  the figures for dependency on the federal gov are easily available , example : https://wallethub.com/edu/states-most-least-dependent-on-the-federal-government/2700/ please show how these are a `` common myth ''  government resources are concentrated in densely populated areas for reasons of efficiency . 
  government resources are concentrated where * people * are concentrated . 
  your point being ? 
   meaning infrastructure . 
  yes , and who benefits from building infrastructure ? 
  businesses . 
  you ca n't just throw a couple of million pounds at a field and expect a motorway to pop up . 
  businesses build it . 
  the islamic state specifically takes credit for the actions of lone wolf attackers . 
  nobody ( or nobody rational ) is unilaterally assigning blame for the actions of some individual in france or belgium to people thousands of miles away . 
  there is no parallel to the criminal actions of one member of the roma community and the roma community at large , unless the leaders of the roma community take responsibility for those criminal actions on behalf of all roma people . 
  it 's not a parallel . 
  if i am a member of an organisation , it can be appropriate to hold me accountable for the actions of that organisation . 
  if i am a member of an ethnic group , it 's not appropriate to hold me accountable for actions of other people who are members of that ethnic group . 
  given an absence of proof anyone else has anything to do with it , any reasonable person would understand the community should n't be held responsible for the actions of an individual, 
  isis : a militant group that people chose to join . 
  roma : an ethnic group that people are born into . 
  cool false equivalence bro, 
  in the same way in most of europe women must ( ... are expected to ) not go topless on most beaches while men can . 
  there is n't assume objectively better/worse ideals of modesty / `` decency '' unless you 're a nudist , in which case i guess you could argue you 're not encumbered by society 's ideals of decency . 
  otherwise you have no high horse here, 
   are muslims only culturally . 
  as opposed to ? 
  hey . 
  hey . 
  hey . 
  he 's just saying we need to be blown up some more ... until we agree with him . 
   like the ones who fought for their freedom in ww2 ww2 ended 71 years ago . 
  someone who turned 14 in 1946 is 85 today . 
  in the vast majority of cases , your argument should read `` like the ones whose parents fought for their freedom in ww2 '' i understand the argument , even if i do n't necessarily subscribe to it . 
  65 + year olds wo n't be looking for jobs in an environment damaged by leaving the free market . 
   i do n't see why only the corporate tax would matter . 
  precisely because the argument against ireland is , and always has been , ireland 's ** corporate tax ** rate is too low . 
   no it does not . 
  if your country did n't get independent from the uk there would n't even be an irish foreign policy . 
  both things happened ( or in the case of brexit , is due to happen in the near future ) . 
  we 're not talking about hypotheticals where they did n't happen . 
  we 're talking about their impact on events today . 
   the fact that he 's an utter cunt in the political stage does not make him any less knowledgeable . 
  tdor was a criticism of the eu . 
  as such bojo 's politics play a fundamental part in it 's validity as a source . 
  hell , it argues turkey should be admitted to the eu . 
  ( something bojo keeps flipflopping on )   it should be perfectly obvious that things that happened centuries ago are less important than current events  are you a parrot or just stupid ?
