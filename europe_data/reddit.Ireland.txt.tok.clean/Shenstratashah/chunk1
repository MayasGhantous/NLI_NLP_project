ireland should change its name to czech republic . 
  when the czechs get fed up with czechia we 'll have the rights !, 
  to get `` czech republic '' back they 'll have to pay us ... one million dollars ! ... 
  or some such figure . 
  spain supported ireland during the nine years war . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nine_years'_war_ ( ireland ), 
  sorry for messing up your map !, 
  best irish surname though would be \u00d3 connmhaigh = descendant of head-smashing . 
  what a delightful chap he must have been !, 
  in terms of names derived from professions - smith is probably number 1 in ireland , as it is in england . 
  smiths would have come in as colonists , while the local mac an ghabhann ( son of the smith ) would have been anglicised to smith . 
  that 's the derivation of the name . 
  however , the murchadh in question was probably not an actual seawarrior . 
  he just got given the name because his parents liked it . 
  the first ever murchadh may have been a seawarrior , but that 's back in the mists of time . 
  if i had a son tomorrow , i could call him miller , but that would n't make him an actual miller . 
  murphy is not a profession . 
  it 's from \u00d3 murchadha = grandson of murchadh . 
  murchadh was a person . 
  [ is that you , dustin ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrh4r2jjbxa ), 
  that name has been in ireland since the 1200s . 
  it 's not really all that remarkable . 
  [ here 's the most famous english : nicky english ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxcayo6u0cq ), 
  hiberno-english is your only man . 
  the 2nd worst hit country in europe for blight was belgium . 
  they stopped the export of food from their country in 1845 , and they also stimulated imports . 
  the work schemes were deliberately unproductive . 
  you had people digging and refilling holes . 
  due to inflation sometimes they did n't even pay enough for a person to be able to buy food . 
  the political climate at the time may have been laissez-faire . 
  however that did not stop the scottish fishing industry from receiving grants to the point that by 1850 it had decimated the irish fishing industry . 
  yes land reform was n't a simple task . 
  it took the land war for the irish farmer to get a bit of justice . 
  famine was not inevitable . 
  the people that starved did so because they were too poor to purchase food . 
  reforms , suggested by a commission , to tackle poverty had been rejected by the british government only a few years before the famine . 
  lord john russell instead introduced his disastrous poor law into ireland against the wishes of both o'connell and castlereagh . 
  it was the intent of the government of lord john russell to drive the poor off the land . 
  i have not called that genocide . 
  i called it mass social cleansing . 
  the famine lasted 5 to 6 years . 
  providing soup kitchens for a brief period is tokenism . 
  the remedies to the situation in ireland were well known at that time . 
  when food shortages hit you immediately stop the export of food . 
  to alleviate poverty you create employment . 
  the reclaimation of millions of acres of wastelands would have done this and also created new farming land . 
  you invest in fisheries . 
  the atlantic ocean is full of fish . 
  a new raliway system in ireland was proposed at the time but rejected . 
  this would have obviously generated a lot of employment land reform . 
  this eventually happened in ireland , but only started in the 1870s . 
  landlordism was unsustainble . 
  however , there was nothing inevitable about the famine . 
  you have just made that up . 
  genocide does not require a population to be reduced to zero . 
  the soup kitchens existed for a short time , and what they provided was of poor quality . 
  the corn brought in made people ill , and was nicknamed peel 's brimstone . 
  well of course they did not need to destroy crops as the crops the poor were dependent on were destroyed by blight . 
  although [ crazy schemes were dreamt up to ethnically cleanse the entire population , and replace them with english and scots ] ( https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/dsc18520319.2.16 ) , the government was principally interested in driving the poor out of the country . 
  so nobody is claiming that government wished for the population to be zero . 
  if the government had done nothing for the duration of the famine then you could say it was indifferent . 
  however it was active , and if we look at what it did do then the conclusion is that it [ wanted to push the poor off the land ] ( http://www.archive.org/stream/economichistory00obri#page/276/mode/2up ) . 
  public works , for instance , were specifically not productive ( they were in scotland ) . 
  reclaiming wastelands would have provided work and helped create new land for farming , but this never happened . 
  it did not seek to give grants for the fishing industry ( these existed in scotland ) . 
  the government made the landlords pay for the poorhouses , with the result that , as it was cheaper for a landlord to pay for someone to emigrate than pay for their stay in the poorhouse , this created another factor in driving the poor out of the country . 
  when you add up the poor law and amendments , the gregory clause , the labour rate act you are getting government action aimed at depopulation . 
  in terms of what you can call the famine , genocide or whatever , i think a better term would be mass social cleansing . 
  yes it was not indifference . 
  the british government believed that ireland 's population was too high , but it was not willing to pay for the `` surplus population '' to emigrate . 
  when the famine struck it meant that the population was forced off the land without the british government having to pick up the tab . 
  this is one of the reasons why they saw the famine as a blessing . 
  the lower house of the irish parliament is d\u00e1il [ \u00c9ireann ] . 
  however , the european parliament is called parlaimint na heorpa in irish . 
  mac oisdealbhaigh is pronounced mok ush ` del ` ah in modern times it has dropped the mac , but kept the hard `` c '' sound ( and lost a few letters at the end ) and adopted the \u00d3 . 
  you can hear [ \u00d3 coisdealbha being pronounced here at 2 minutes and 52 seconds ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snoasr6npvi ), 
  you 're right . 
  i was going from memory and thought costello was a branch of the burkes . 
  fair enough . 
  i 'm not familiar with that site . 
  however , if someone is interested in finding out their origins then they should start with the books of edward maclysaght, 
  yes , but that is not the origin of their name . 
  the first o'neill was [ domhnall \u00d3 n\u00e9ill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/domnall_ua_n%c3%a9ill ) , and he was the grandson of niall gl\u00fandubh . 
  there were still vikings in ireland when the normans arrived . 
  the normans kicked them out of waterford and dublin . 
  the last viking king of dublin [ was killed by the normans . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ascall_mac_ragnaill ), 
  this map just shows the powerful families of the era . 
  however , the kellys from omagh and the kellys from galway had different origins . 
  they are not related . 
  surnames where adopted in ireland over a thousand years ago . 
  this was done as power was consolidated in fewer hands . 
  so they started off as the names of the powerful . 
  here 's a few examples of their origins and meanings : o'neill = \u00d3 n\u00e9ill = grandson of niall gl\u00fandubh , high king of ireland , killed at the battle of islandbridge in 919 . 
  o'connor = \u00d3 conchubhair = grandson of conchubhar mac taidhg an t\u00fair , king of connacht ( died 971 ) . 
  o'brien = \u00d3 briain = grandson of brian boru , high king of ireland , killed at the battle of clontarf in 1014 . 
  overtime different branches of the names developed , and there would have been a few different o'sullivan names as an example . 
  or different names adopted entirely such as the burkes , who used several other names such as mcwilliams , jennings , costello , etc. 
  the problem of keeping track of everyone persists to this day .
