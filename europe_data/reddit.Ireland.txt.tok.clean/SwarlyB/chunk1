i do agree we got side-tracked sorry about that , so ill address his comment directly . 
   we have a politician who called for guerilla warfare at a time of peace and fair representation not true , he was calling for the honoring of them , not for any action . 
  honoring is not equal to calling for an armed guerilla campaign in any way . 
  it 's the people who democratically elected him who put him in his position . 
  that is not an affront to democracy , that ** is ** democracy . 
  to some people honoring the actions pira is legitimate , just as people honoring those who fought the british in 1916 . 
  now i am not in favour on honouring them , but the point stands that it is a legitimate stance if we like it or not . 
  i however defend their legitimacy given the context of the troubles but not their un-disciplined methods of civilian murder . 
  i 'm pretty sure we are n't thinking too much unalike , but saying those things does not make a person unelectable . 
  just look at northern ireland , most politicians have an actual connection to paramilitary activity , not simply putting out a message of support . 
  how can you not see that people who praise the british state for their actions are electable ( ** which is many ** ) while the other-way they are not ? 
  i dislike the fact many british do n't agree that their state were terrorists , and simply acting in the electorates name does not make it less evil or more electable . 
  this was actually a good chat man , hope no hard feelings i try not to be too aggressive when discussing these sensitive matters i 'm passionate about . 
  i understand your viewpoint since england was by and large on the sidelines ( ** not saying the english did not suffer ** ) of the conflict and therefore smaller acts such as perceived support for a `` terrorist sympathizer '' might be off , but its not as strange as its made out to be , is what i 'm trying to convey . 
   * it 's interesting that you bring up blair , since almost the only good thing he achieved was helping to bring about the gfa , which mcdonnell 's statements shit all over . 
  i bring up blair because i do n't only care about the oppression of my own people , people like mcdonnell and corbyn were the only type trying to discuss , `` maybe the pira is n't just a senseless evil organisation that has no reason to exist other than killing innocent british '' . 
  you see the acts of government declaring war differently than i. i see that as state terrorism , we all know they pretenses for war were a fabrication , adn the war itself was brutal and full of war crimes , therefore the war was not legitimate and was simply a state slaughtering thousands of people in a foreign country , and then saying whoops . 
  how come for citizens ignorance of wrongdoing is not a valid defense , but for states it 's their only defense . 
   it sounds as if you think we should be happy to vote in someone terrible as some sort of national penance for every bad thing a british government has ever done . 
  not at all , i hold no grudge over the british , i do however take exception to the british saying that terrorism is worse than war , and that killing thousands under false pretenses is somehow more morally justifiable than any attack against that state . 
  it 's pure hypocrisy , your state both condemns and commits , and not to forget british supported terrorism in ni which has finally been fully proven the past two years . 
  and what did you think the pira supported , or the ira before them , or the irb and irish citizens army . 
  they all supported the removal of british oppression or as you would say stop the british from `` hurting them '' . 
  hmm adding a bit of racism at the end there really helps me understand your viewpoint thanks for that . 
  the british has cause greater suffering than all terrorist organisations combined . 
  think why would any of these organisations want to hurt you ? 
  or do n't and dwell in your ignorance and blind patriotism , and simply ignore nuance . 
  i 'll end with a quote by walter rodney :  `` by what standard of morality can the violence used by a slave to break his chains be considered the same as the violence of a slave master ? '', 
  both thatcher and blair were the highest level of politician in their day , and britain was perfectly fine with their murderous actions . 
  i can pretty much call up any british pm and show somewhere were they were complicit in the murder of civilians all across the globe and in ireland . 
  britain has literally zero moral authority on any matter , your current government wholly supports the saudis and their indiscriminate bombing of innocents . 
  again mcdonnell has n't actually hurt anybody , but the entire british state has always been involved in foreign slaughter , labour or conservative . 
  unlike the entire uk history of massacre , genocide and terrorist collusion ? 
  i 'm sure that was all compassionate left-wing politics aswell . 
  mate your entire political spectrum has had its fair share of un-caring murdering psychopaths . 
  the only difference is mcdonnell did n't actually cause any deaths , simply said something controversial . 
  hey now , we had to deal with the yank bastards wall !, 
  i like the way you think, 
  yep to an absolute fault , also just like the weather . 
  and ireland, 
  oh lord , that was meant for someone else , sorry about that !, 
  i actually see what you 're saying . 
   code of practice states more appropriate terms should be used where possible . 
  not a ban , a simple list of recommended alternatives . 
  do n't pretty much all workplaces have actual policies promoting professional language at all times ? 
  free speech does ! = getting to say what you want without people giving you shit for it . 
  your speech can and will be criticised in a free society , the reflection of a free society is the critique of speech . 
  edit : replied to the wrong peep, 
  yeah 13th amendment , there 's a very good documentary about it on netflix called `` 13th '' . 
  what about say , your dad robs someone and gives you the money ? 
  it 's still stolen money . 
  you still have to return stolen goods even if they are given to you by the thief . 
  that is a more apt analogy . 
   ireland which people like you seem unwilling to even entertain as a notion . 
  but you see i do n't have a problem with tackling it , i have a problem engaging in dialogue with a manipulative liar . 
  blame varadkar for bringing it up in such a scummy way , i 've said this before but if you really do care about welfare fraud you 'd be mad at him for poisoning the conversation and injecting his own leadership bullshit , and also `` he 's doing it to boost his profile for leadership '' is not a valid excuse at all whatsoever , it makes it much worse . 
  yeah 'cause that 's a normal thing to do . 
  it 's crystal clear what he tried to do with that campaign , and it was n't to simply bring awareness . 
  | into how much it would have cost the state if they had n't been caught . 
  so our systems are working very well then ? 
  why mention the fraud were stopping in an attempt to show we are not stopping enough when we are in fact stopping ~ 92 % of the aforementioned 500 million . 
  you can not argue he was being honest with that 500 million figure , he literally made up ( sorry extrapolated ) a once off statistic so he could make the situation sound much much worse than it is in reality . 
  politicians keep doing these manipulative bullshit campaigns because people like you are seemingly willing to ignore the obvious intentions of them and instead attempt to talk technicalities such as `` oh the figure was correct , it 's just a weird way to go about it '' , or it 's technically correct if you add in x , y , and z ( ya know things people are n't going to be informed about when they read it on the side of a god damn bus ) . 
  like , it 's on a bus that it costs us 500 million , not that it ** can ** cost us 500 million . 
  again , he did n't just `` go after welfare fraud '' he lied by a margin of 15.2 times the amount of money lost from welfare fraud . 
  why would he lie so gratuitously ? 
  it 's disgusting manipulative behavior and no one should be expected to start a dialogue with someone who not only obviously does not care for the truth of the matter , but is also pushing a conservative ideological fight against the scary `` slackers '' , in place of trying to tackle the massive wealth inequality in our society which keeps growing and growing . 
  yeah seeing that now . 
  unbelievable stuff , the us police protecting foreign secret service as they beat up their own citizens . 
  they shoot their own civilians for much less than what happened here , even if the civilian does n't have a gun like these guys . 
  and the police arrest protestors who were doing absolutely nothing , wtf ? 
  like you can see the lad in the blue initially get attacked and stomped on , but then he 's arrested and the lads who attacked are handwaved/pushed away . 
  all while there are still old lads getting directly kicked in the face while on the ground , still , cops do nothing but arrest protestors . 
  unreal stuff . 
  it 's how a lot of scandi countries handle their crime . 
  they have one of the lowest incarceration rates and recidivism rates meaning those who end up in prison are successfully rehabilitated and introduced back into society , thus making society safer . 
  it 's a better method that the us , uk and most of europe . 
  so if you feel they need to be killed , kept in a cage for  25 years , or castrated , as other countries do currently , you 're going to have to prove to me that it makes me and my fellow citizens safer . 
  can you do that ? 
  oh that one , but the dude asked for a real source . 
  like the guys said : | thats not a american conservative magazine quoting a svenskdemocrat sympathising online magazine that lacks swedish press credentials and also this is the case of a minor , and also this is how sweden handles non-immigrant crime too . 
  as in a native swede would have gotten that sentence too , so are you mad that an immigrant/refugee got a short sentence or are you mad at how sweden handles its crime ? 
  the world seeing is not a source . 
  that 's a no then , okay cool . 
  | terrified of being called racist . 
  where 's the proof ? 
  can police now just claim vague `` pc culture boogymen '' , and get off scot free with allowing children to get raped ? 
  where 's their responsibility , this is 100 % the police 's responsibility . 
  they are meant to protect people , but no , in this case , they called victims `` unrapable '' , and when their inaction was horrifically discovered the absolute cowards blamed the all so scary pc culture , and `` not wanting to be called a racist '' , how weak , that the very poeple that are meant to protect us against bodily harm , even sometimes by putting themselves in the way of bodily harm can not stand to get called racist , even if it means saving children getting raped . 
  like if what you are saying is true , your police force let people get raped because they were disgusting cowards who decided not the do the right thing . 
  no the ** police ** left 100 's of children to get raped and then blamed their own inaction on some vague `` pc culture '' . 
  precisely because people will lap that shit up and pass off the blame to some boogyman `` leftists wanting us to get ** raped ** '' . 
  this was the police 's responsibility , not vague ** leftists ** who are not in charge of the fucking police . 
  hey there , thanks for taking the time to say this over the thread . 
  it really gets toxic in here , since some people really hate to have their pre-conceived notions about sex and gender challenged . 
  you doing good work !, 
  how can this issue be considered | basic biological facts when the scientific consensus does n't even agree with your `` basic biological fact '' ? 
  | in other news , i 've just bred the world 's first avian-pig cross . 
  no matter what else you said , i want to zone in on this . 
  like i 've lived in london , and have worked there , why would it be hard to think an irish person has done this ?
