it does partly depend on knowing the name . 
  i vote up when daniel says these things in the comments on slacktivist . 
  no , they really are n't . 
  and they probably were n't then either . 
  but they 're better than american politics . 
  distinctly better . 
   the limeys saw our politics as vitriolic and populist , where as theirs was mature and stately . 
  how times have changed . 
  i 'm not sure things have changed much , to be honest , in that regard , at least . 
   mayo : bible belt . 
  that one 's new to me . 
  midlands : bog ( this is true ( i 'm from offaly ) ) . 
  you are actively evil . 
  also very clever . 
  they could have a [ gay off ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv55cvmscre ) , like simon amstell & john barrowman . 
  as a kid , in the summer , i was barefoot if i possibly could be , in doors and out . 
  i still would be if i had a house with a garden . 
   we 're the country that goes apeshit whenever unpasteurized cheese sneaks past customs . 
  for some countries , that sort of thing would make sense . 
  i 'm thinking of australia and new zealand , which tend to be somewhat fanatical about biological imports , with good reason . 
  i did not know that . 
  it 's cool . 
  er , thanks ? 
  i enjoyed shooting that one down . 
  it 's a [ selfue ] ( http://english.stackexchange.com/q/218509/1696 ) . 
  prague is , i was once told , the gay porn capital of the world . 
  the irish r\u00ed is shown on the map , but is n't present in the key . 
  i 'm guessing it 's latinate . 
  they can always get bbc radio 4 . 
   viking , north uitsera , south uitsera . 
  some orthodox churches do use the gregorian , i think . 
  what calendar do eastern rite catholics use ? 
  it 's in the tradition of british music hall sketches . 
  like you cheese ? 
  this is how many languages handle it , and it 's still valid english , though rare in practice . 
  some got bilingual signs in english and ulster scots . 
  being ( a ) bigots and ( b ) too stupid to tell the difference between such vastly different languages as irish and ulster scots ( these two points may not be unrelated ) , they vandalized them to remove the ulster scots . 
  there 's no helping some people . 
  it 's almost the same course as english , but easier , to allow for the fact that most people are n't good at irish . 
  there are plenty of native english speakers who do n't do higher level english , but when have you ever heard of a native irish speaker not doing higher level irish ? 
  there should be a * proper * irish literature course , just as hard as the english one . 
  there should also be a * proper * irish language course ( perhaps a little tougher than the french , german , spanish , etc. , to allow for the fact that we have some grounding in primary school ) . 
  it should be compulsory to take * one * of those two courses . 
  tom scott : [ a red big balloon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtm1tjyr5_m ) . 
  one morning , i was travelling home to tullamore after a night in dublin . 
  sitting across the table from me on the train was a young man from spain . 
  he 'd been in ireland for three months , but this was his first time outside dublin city . 
  the whole trip he was staring out the window , exclaiming several times over how * green * it was . 
  to be fair , i 've taken a train through span , and it was mainly yellow , so i suppose there was quite a contrast . 
  given how shitty protection for tenants is in this country , there 's a lot of pressure to buy property . 
  i got thrown out of a place i 'd lived in for over two years with less than a month 's notice . 
   finnegans wake no apostrophe . 
  * that * is an inside joke on / r/ireland . 
   alcoholics do all celtic peoples have the same stereotype ? 
  france is a very strongly centralized country , is n't it ? 
  a language is a dialect with an army . 
  there really is no clear definition of what makes a `` language '' . 
  that reminds me of the time ireland beat pakistan in cricket . 
  `` wait , we have a cricket team ?! '', 
  `` simple robberies '' rarely involve hostage situations . 
  it was just rather astonishing to see something sensible in the * daily mail * . 
  better ? 
  there was a til t ` other day about hawaii being excluded from nato , so it would n't surprise me to learn that asian turkey is also excluded . 
   europeanised versions ( and therefore superior ) of the american intelligence agencies i do like the smugness . 
  it actually has a certain ( small ) basis in fact : europeans are willing to learn from american successes and failures , to adopt their good ideas and avoid the mistakes of their bad . 
  americans seem reluctant to even consider anyone else 's experience . 
  broad generalization , of course , but i think there 's some truth to it . 
  flag of a country : airport of a city . 
  oddly , tolkien disliked irish , but loved welsh . 
  there 's a mountain in wales called cader idris , which really sounds like a placename from middle-earth . 
  it 's also further north than the north . 
  still used in icelandic . 
  there 's a galway city in county galway . 
  i 'd guess that this photo is from connemara . 
  because it 's 35 min in * one * situation , and 30 min in * all other situations * . 
  * junior club * junior intercounty * senior club * ladies intercounty and whatever else , are all 30 min . 
  the uk is outside shengen . 
  ninh ly has [ a whole series of those videos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl9nyvjxby6soxm8ujvbqxmpbdsvjldclw ) . 
  they 're helpful . 
  there 's also gaa rounders , i think . 
   he/she/they he . 
  it 's one person : randall munroe . 
  the narrator had to explain '' [ he 's saying * points * not * pints * ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x398o2n_rec521_auto ) '' in this introduction to hurling . 
   ghoti * gh * is only ever silent at the end of a syllable . 
  * o * is pronounced ` \u026a ` only in the single word * women * . 
  * ti * has the quality of ` \u0283 ` only when followed by a vowel . 
  english does have exceptions , but there are also patterns . 
  it 's not quite as absurd as people say it is . 
  that 's aussie rules , yes ? 
  i mean , i know nothing about sports , but aussie rules football is visually impressive . 
  almost as attention-grabbing as hurling or sepak takraw . 
  i know there used to be a rink in dublin , because i was there a couple of times as a kid . 
  no idea whether there still is . 
  and i doubt it was big enough for proper ice hockey . 
  i went to ice rinks in the uk a few times . 
  they all advertised themselves as `` olympic sized '' . 
  if you want to be really truly pedantic ( and rather old fashioned ) , words beginning with an * h * sound and an * unstressed syllable * take * an * ; words beginning with an * h * sound and a * stressed syllable * take * a * . 
  i bet you win at mornington crescent . 
  gaelic football is two 30-min halves , or 35-min for senior intercounty . 
  aussie rules football is four 20-min quarters .
