  canadian football is four 15-min quarters . 
  the only other football games i know of are the eton wall game and the eton field game , and i do n't know how long they are . 
  come join us in / r/theocho . 
  that * is * interesting . 
  what on earth is the flag for french there ? 
  using national flags for language options is rarely wise . 
  most ux people advise against it . 
  intentionally recreating czechoslovak identity , or recreating it as a by-product ? 
   if you thought the refugee crisis was bad , wait until half of africa becomes unfit for agriculture . 
  i 'm still wondering why ireland has n't caught the infection . 
  i mean , i 'm glad , but it 's not as if we 're notably better informed than other europeans . 
  do republicans ever actually * do * anything ? 
  as far as i can tell , their speciality is throwing temper tantrums . 
  are there many who would vote for on the basis that they should follow the referendum result ? 
  why is prague ... ... the gay porn capital of the world ? 
   the holy roman empire , which , as every schoolboy knows , was neither holy , nor roman , nor an empire . 
  the vast majority of us have english as a first language , which possibly orients our media intake ( for both entertainment and news ) differently to continental europe . 
  we are europeans , and we do see ourselves as such ( far more than the british ever did , probably ) , but we 're also unavoidably part of the broader anglosphere , even if some of us wish we were n't . 
  i wonder how much this shapes our attitudes , and whether it really makes us `` incomplete europeans '' . 
  of course , being an island nation also has something to do with it , probably . 
  yes . 
  they 've blocked it a few times . 
  another example of protestants standing against equality , so it undermines the point of the article : germany is n't unique in this regard . 
  ( sinn f\u00e9inn do support equality , but it would be simplistic to call them catholic : they disagree with the church on many matters , and in fact claim to be socialist . ), 
  however , my initial complaint was with the inaccurate map labelling . 
  northern ireland is n't in britain anyway . 
  they 're both small economies which will soon lose an open border with a larger neighbour . 
  [ the word * marriage * does matter ] ( http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2011/01/29/30137 ), 
  map caption :  britain , except northern ireland \\* sigh \\*, 
  dunno about london , but you 've certainly fucked northern ireland and gibraltar . 
  well , his flair is [ the most bad-ass city flag in the world ] ( https://www.ted.com/talks/roman_mars_why_city_flags_may_be_the_worst_designed_thing_you_ve_never_noticed?language=en ) . 
  my native language is english with the occasional french or irish phrase thrown in ( pourquoi ? 
  je sais pas ) , though i speak neither of those languages with any degree of fluency . 
  this is a habit i picked up from my mother . 
  ( my dad , who has fluent french , does not drop it into his english nearly as much as my mother does . ), 
  my parents are english , and do not know irish , but they moved over here before i was born , so i was taught it in school . 
  how much do you actually know about martin luther king 's methods of protest ? 
  champagne comes from the north , no ? 
  a friend of mine once said that belgians will do anything to avoid speaking french . 
  they 'll even speak * english * . 
  there is a leprechaun museum in dublin . 
  -- and there 's a farm near me where the farmer carefully ploughs * around * a hawthorn tree in the middle of a field . 
   pikeys \\* boggle \\* i thought that word was specific to irish travellers . 
  it 's also rather a slur , as you seem to know . 
  nor is ours . 
  one of the constituencies is `` graduates of the university of dublin '' . 
  i 'd use * british * to mean `` of the uk '' , but * britain * to mean `` great britain '' . 
  this largely accords with usage in the uk itself . 
  just to clarify in my own mind , `` freedom of movement '' is specifically about * working * in other states , is n't it ? 
   gibraltar given that they 're basically a microstate themselves , you 'd think they 'd 've heard of san marino . 
  the prototypical cheese , to my mind , is cheddar . 
  things may be different in spain .

  oh , is [ something happening ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mj48x6-jzs ) ? 
  i learned english in school : it 's taught as a literature course . 
  you study poetry and plays , a couple of novels , and are taught to write essays and literary analysis and some short fiction . 
  i learned french in school : it 's taught as a language course . 
  you 're given grammar and vocabulary lessons , and taught to read newspaper articles and answer basic questions about their content to ensure that your comprehension is correct . 
  there 's also an oral exam . 
  if you do higher level french you 'll also have to study a * little * poetry , and are taught how to write a short essay . 
  i learned irish in school : it 's taught as an uneasy compromise . 
  technically , it 's taught as a literature course , but an absurdly easy one to account for the fact that almost no one taking the course is fluent in the language . 
  plenty of native english speakers do n't take higher level english . 
  higher level english is * hard * : you 're expected to study shakespeare in fair depth , and to be able to discourse on several poets . 
  by contrast , i 've never heard of a native irish speaker not taking higher level irish . 
  it 's a ridiculously easy literature course ; or a ridiculously tough language course . 
  personally , i 'd like to see it split out into two separate courses , and offer people the option of taking the irish literature course or the irish language course , as they wished . 
  a proper tough irish literature course modelled on the english one would be a great thing to see , and a great resource for those who * are * fluent in the language and would like to enjoy its depth and its poetry . 
  as far as the formal written language is concerned , there are pretty much two forms of english : america , and the rest of the world . 
  that 's not * quite * true \\* , but it 's true enough for most purposes . 
  examples : hiberno-english and british english are , in the formal written register , almost identical , but they do have some differences , such as press/cupboard , ditch/hedge , hot press/airing cupboard , and mineral/fizzy drink . 
  ( that last is used on the automated announcement on ianr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann : `` a trolley service will operate to your seat , serving tea , coffee , sandwiches , minerals and snacks . '' ), 
  oooh . 
  cool . 
  i did not know that . 
  so that makes three elected monarchs that i know of , and one appointed . 
  hmm . 
  i probably should have said monarchs . 
  europe has three non-hereditary monarchies . 
  one appoints one of the others . 
  the third is democratically elected by the citizens of a different country . 
  those hats are awesome !, 
  a lot of people also respect her personally , even if they do n't much respect the institution . 
  it 'll be interesting to see what happens under king charles . 
  in ireland , a handshake on greeting would be normal in formal or semi-formal situations . 
  between friends , a hug would not be uncommon , especially if you 've not met for a while . 
  other than that , there 's usually no physical aspect to greeting . 
  the irish are good at deadpan humour , and enjoy `` winding people up '' . 
  it can be very hard , sometimes , to know whether they 're joking , or just trying to `` get a rise out of you '' ( i.e. , get you to react ) . 
  similar to the refugee issues : drug rehabilitation centres and treatment for mental illnesses are things everyone wants but no one wants close by . 
  that 's significantly less true than it used to be , but i can see why the stereotype exists . 
  the drunken irish stereotype i understand . 
  the fighting irish one ? 
  where does that come from ? 
  i think it 's an american thing . 
  the british do n't seem to have that stereotype of ireland : they tell stupid irish jokes ( we tell the same jokes here , but our punching bag is kerry ) . 
  i 'm not sure what stereotypes continental europeans have of us .
