  secondly , bilingualism is very common in ukraine so either or questions do n't fully explain the situation . 
  many people speak both russian and ukrainian . 
   chechnya is a muslim territory , it 's not truly part of russia , and therefore i strongly recommend that no one considers them european in any way . 
  i can understand not considering chechnya part of europe for geographical reasons , but not for religious reasons . 
  europe is a place not a religion , if a place is muslim that does n't stop it from being europe . 
   the judgement of god sent the calamity to teach the irish a lesson , that calamity must not be too much mitigated . 
  read it again . 
  the quote says that god is punishing the irish , not the british . 
  it 's saying that they should not intervene , but instead let it take its course . 
  it 's passive not active . 
   `` being altogether beyond the power of man , the cure had been applied by the direct stroke of an all-wise providence same thing again , its passive not active . 
  show me proof of an active claim to destroy the irish , not merely ignoring a natural disaster . 
   so take your self hating apologism and do you , toadies like you make me retch ... ah blow it out your arse, 
  why are you repeating my quote ? 
  what evidence is there that the british intended to destroy ( in whole or in part ) the irish people ? 
  the fact that they were racist against us does n't count ( racism is far more common than genocide ) , so where is the intent ? 
  i do n't know where you 're getting that definition from , according to the un , it 's the `` intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group '' ( several examples of methods follow ) . 
  so the holocaust was genocide even if not every single jew died because there was an intent to kill them all . 
  likewise , the famine was not genocide because there was no intent . 
   ignore the destruction of irish culture what are you talking about ? 
  more than half the comments here are in a thread about the famine and enormous damage it did to ireland . 
   especially by threatening excommunication against those who interfered with the export of food from ireland when millions were starving to death . 
  that never happened, 
   genocide is n't defined by `` kill them all till they 're dead '' , what a ridiculous assertion that is what genocide means . 
  hitler did n't merely steal land from the jews and treat them as serfs , he `` killed them all till they 're dead '' . 
  weakening a country is not the same as committing genocide against it . 
   you have just made that up . 
  genocide does not require a population to be reduced to zero . 
  no , it requires the ** intention ** to reduce the population to zero ( and of course acting on that intention ) . 
   the soup kitchens existed for a short time , and what they provided was of poor quality . 
  and fed hundreds of thousands of people in that time . 
  if they wanted the poor irish to die , why give them any food at all ? 
   at which point a functioning country would have had to fall back upon ... all the food a mostly-fields-and-pastures , temperate , island nation could produce . 
  which is a lot of food , except ireland at the time had a huge number of subsistence farmers on tiny plots that only grew potatoes . 
  larger farmers had other crops to fall back on , but the very poor were wiped out . 
  did the british create and design the blight ? 
  how did they exacerbate the spread of blight ? 
  if genocide was their intention , why did the famine end after 1850 ? 
  why not keep going until there were no irish left ? 
   so nobody is claiming that government wished for the population to be zero . 
  that 's what genocide is . 
  i think a lot of people in this thread think that genocide is just racial hatred and murder , but it 's the systematic destruction of a people . 
   when you add up the poor law and amendments , the gregory clause , the labour rate act you are getting government action aimed at depopulation . 
  where do the soup kitchens and cheap corn fit into your narrative ? 
   in practice , it 's the difference between a guy rudely bumping a dude off the edge of a cliff and looking on calmly while the dude hangs desperately on with one hand , i 'd say it 's more akin to the wind blowing someone nearly off the edge of a cliff while a second person watches and does n't intervene . 
  the second person is then accused of trying to wipe out the first person 's entire family . 
  the famine was a natural disaster ( the british did n't invent or spread the blight ) and despite the enormous death toll , there was never any threat of the irish people being wiped out or replaced in ireland . 
  really ? 
  i did n't know that . 
  however , it should be noted that they never saw action and the soldiers were never used to take food from the people . 
  so they were not responsible for the starvation . 
   intervene ? 
  you make it sound like it happened organically . 
  well the famine was a natural disaster . 
   british government deliberately stopped other countries from giving food . 
  also although there is the infamous case with the ottomans in general , foreign donations were allowed ( the quakers in particular raised a lot ) and other countries had problems of their own and little interest in sending much food . 
  that 's not a thing, 
   there may have been no partition , depending on the demographic balance , so an independent united ireland . 
  there would still be a protestant minority in the north . 
  they would be greatly outnumbered , but not enough so as to be completely ignored . 
   we 'd essentially be taiwan . 
  probably a population of about 20 million , maybe more . 
   assuming that there would be employment for all these extra people , which based on our history ( even after independence ) is unlikely . 
  i 'm irish 2 . 
  british troops prevented theft of goods , in order words , they upheld the law . 
  perhaps you believe that people have a right to steal food if they 're starving , but that 's a separate philosophical debate . 
  it was not the british government that exported food ( because the state did n't own the land ) it was merchants who believed they could get a better price abroad than in ireland . 
  again , you may think they were wrong to do so , but your complaint is with capitalism not the british . 
  yes the government failed to intervene enough to ameliorate the starvation , but no they did not actively try to exterminate people . 
  your quote shows that they blamed the irish for their own problems , just as the rich always blame the poor . 
  it does n't prove that they wanted to destroy the irish . 
   this is one of the reasons why they saw the famine as a blessing . 
  there is a big difference between reacting positively to a natural disaster and actively exacerbating it . 
  they stood back and let the famine take its course , they did not intervene to make it worse ( for example by destroying crops ) . 
  they did think ireland was over-populated however , at no point did they suggest that the population should be reduced to zero . 
   that i posted above literally saying that the market and god were telling them not to intervene . 
  that 's my point , they did n't intervene . 
  if they went around burning crops and shooting people , then you could argue it was genocide . 
  however , they refused to intervene , which is better described as neglect and indifference . 
  they did n't care that people died , but crucially they did n't directly kill them . 
   felt comfortable with doing nothing that 's my point . 
  the famine was awful due to what the government ** did n't do ** rather than what it ** did do **, 
   knowing that corn tariffs and the landlord system are killing hundreds of thousands of your citizens the corn tariffs were repealed in 1846 and the landlord system was maintained as it was considered the best system for running the country , not as a method to kill the irish . 
  the british mainland also had a landlord system and there was no real conceivable alternative to it in those days . 
   choosing not to act because they happen to be gaelic irish is effectively genocide . 
  no that 's not what genocide means . 
  genocide is the deliberate and intentional action to destroy a people . 
  there was no deliberate action by the british government ( instead it was a failure to act ) and there was no intent to exterminate the irish people . 
  the british government were guilty of indifference and neglect , but not genocide . 
  well there 's a huge demand for places in all schools regardless of language . 
  most schools have large waiting lists , so i do n't believe gaelscoileanna are being singled out for punishment . 
  yeah thanks , should have said genocide, 
  [ here 's a breakdown ] ( http://imgur.com/a/j3ns7 ) of the religious data . 
  it 's interesting that not only is the `` no religion '' group the second largest , but it 's also larger than all other non-catholic groups combined . 
  as horrific as the famine was , it was not a genocide . 
  there was no plan to exterminate the irish race . 
  their policies are n't any different to any previous government . 
  we ca n't expect the government to force a language revival , that will only happen if irish people themselves want to learn and use the language . 
  yeah that really surprised me as well . 
  maybe it 's because irish is n't classed as a minority or regional language but is technically the first official language of the country ?
