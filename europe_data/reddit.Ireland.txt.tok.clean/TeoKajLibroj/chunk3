   the problem with esperanto becoming an official language is that it has no native speakers . 
  actually it is estimated that there are between 1-2 ,000 native speakers and i 've met quite a few of them . 
  [ here is a video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzds2wyembi ) interviewing several of them with subtitles in 25 languages . 
  well if we commented in esperanto you would n't be able to understand us . 
  if you are interested in what esperanto looks like and want to see it in action , then come over to / r/esperanto, 
  actually i 've had many political conversations in esperanto and have even written a few political articles . 
  there is also a scientific journal and science conferences in esperanto . 
  so no , you can have complex political and scientific conversations in esperanto . 
  well i would n't call english neutral by any measure . 
  speaking it gives an advantage to native speakers from britain , america etc and bloats their culture . 
  also the main reason why so many people speak english is because england invaded and conquered many countries , replacing their native language with english . 
  i think there 's lots of good reasons to support esperanto . 
  * if people have to learn another language , might as well make it as easy as possible . 
  * if there 's a common eu language , might as well use a neutral one instead if giving an unfair advantage to one country . 
  only if you already speak a romantic language , esperanto has a broader mixture of source languages, 
  this , but unironically, 
  are you joking ? 
   are you slovenia ? 
   no fucking faggot god the `` jokes '' in polandball are absolutely terrible, 
  apart from showing what a major disappointment it must have been for the pvv , it 's interesting to note that there was a sharp swing to the right in the final days . 
  not sure if i 'll do anything to celebrate it this year . 
  it 's a shame that many people ( including many irish people ) think the highest expression of irish culture is to wear something green and get drunk . 
  there were multiple reasons : poverty , anti-semitism , catholicism , isolationism , xenophobia , fear of provoking anti-semitism . 
  it 's hard to know which was dominant . 
  well partly that and partly no one really wanted to come in . 
   not that low level . 
  there was an economic boycott of jews for over 2 years in one of the largest cities in the country . 
  true , except that was the only anti-semetic event in irish history . 
  it only affected 100 jews . 
  it 's still a disgrace that it happened , but compared with the history of the jews throughout europe over the past 1000 years , it was low level . 
   we also had a prominent leading politician who was vehemently against jews in ireland another disgrace ( especially as he was one of the longest serving tds ) but again there was only one of him . 
  if anyone 's wondering why ireland had such a low figure , it 's because the country was poor and rural , with high levels of emigration . 
  most people wanted to leave and few wanted to go here . 
  as a result the jewish community was historically very small . 
  there was some anti-semitism but on a low level . 
  it is estimated that as few as 50 jewish refugees were given asylum during ww2 . 
  after the war , a large proportion of the community emigrated to israel which is why the size of the community dropped . 
  they probably all know each other . 
  or maybe only 11 of them are in contact and now they 're wondering who the last one is . 
  well not everyone in europe can understand french so you 're holding too high of a standard . 
  they did not colonise or conquer the country , nor did they enslave the people . 
  taking a few slaves does not count as enslavement of the irish . 
   i think these laws only exist to save embaressment to governments . 
  i do n't know what you mean, 
  i ca n't claim to speak for the irish , even if i am one , but you are talking nonsense . 
  that 's not true . 
  the vikings raided ireland many times and founded several settlements , but they never colonised or enslaved the irish people . 
  it 's also very easy to be casual and dismissive about events that happened a thousand years ago , especially if you only have a distant connection to ireland . 
  the holocaust is a far more recent , personal and horrifying experience . 
  is it naive of me to hope that more debates look like this ? 
  someone makes a claim and then a knowledgeable source replies using evidence and studies . 
  or are immigration debates doomed to be based on ** conspiracy theories ** ( the government is covering up the truth !, 
  ) , ** hearsay ** ( well i heard that there 's no-go areas , so there ) and ** wishful thinking ** ( i believe immigration is terrible so it must be destroying sweden ) ? 
   ni , all border regions seem to have voted remain . 
  the south and west is predominately catholic who generally supported remain , while the north and east is more protestant and supported leave . 
  the blue constituencies have unionist mps while the yellow ones have nationalist mps . 
  no but i 've also never committed assault . 
  if i did , i would be delighted to receive such a lenient punishment ( i would have expected months or years ), 
   domestic violence is just not a felony anymore , obviously they did n't start allowing to beat your wife to death . 
  why not ? 
  surely any act of violence should be considered a serious crime ? 
  the law should strongly intervene even if the wife is n't beaten to death . 
   however , if a random guy hit you on a street , it 's just an administrative offence . 
  what is an administrative offence ? 
  why is assault not considered a serious crime meriting prison time ? 
  how the hell does the russian justice system operate . 
   but i do n't think the law should rely on feelings . 
  the law always considers mitigating factors like feeling , intention etc. 
  consider the example of manslaughter and hate crimes . 
   this will actually increase awareness of domestic abuse since the victims would n't hesitate anymore to report the crimes in fear of sending their parent/kid/relative to prison . 
  to me , it seems the opposite would occur . 
  it takes a lot of courage to report an abusive partner and there is a serious risk of reprisal . 
  now if they report abuse , they are not safe or protected , the abusive partner is free to take revenge . 
   so it seems there can still be major consequences how can you possibly call two weeks in jail `` major consequences '' ? 
  the response to this question depends massively on who they are fighting against, 
   38 % in ireland which is higher than all other western european countires . 
  pretty much the only scenario in which ireland would go to war would be if we were invaded by britain so that 's probably how people interpreted it . 
  it 's also a purely imaginary scenario because ireland has never gone to war since independence in 1922 . 
  they 're not related to the roma , but they have a similar lifestyle, 
  yes they are, 
  i 'm not sure how much the rest of europe knows about travellers , but there 's a lot of similar issues as with roma gypsies . 
  both are nomadic people that suffer from poverty and discrimination . 
  what is wrong with you ? 
  not necessarily to the town mentioned in the article . 
  your link does n't say that they will be the first sent . 
  also i 've never heard of 16 year olds being called young men, 
   it does n't make sense to send the young men first and the under 16 's afterwards , surely they are most at risk ? 
   who said young men are being moved first ? 
  that 's not what the article said, 
  well ballaghaderreen is n't the only refugee site in the country , so it may be that none of the people from the calais site are being sent there . 
  according to the article 100 children will be moved to the town , some of whom are probably teens and some are probably younger . 
  what 's your point ? 
  i think this article is interesting for a number of reasons : * it counters the patronising narrative that rural people are incapable of integrating with foreigners * it shows that most people are positive and willing to help * yet does n't ignore the fact that integration requires effort and support * the similarities between past experiences of the irish and current experience of syrians * the broader economic problems, 
   wow , since ireland has their own language they must be a legit nation state are you implying that ireland is n't a legitimate nation-state ? 
  found the jackeen, 
  everyone knows the real divide in ireland is between the pale ( dublin ) and the rest of the country . 
  in ireland little distinction is drawn between detached and semi-detached houses . 
  obviously the semis are cheaper , but there 's no cultural preference . 
  the light yellow is semi-detached houses , the dark yellow is flats . 
  according to the chart about 3 % of accommodation is flats,
