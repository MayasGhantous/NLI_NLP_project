  people do n't learn it because people do n't learn it . 
  what about a hypothetical situation where it was promoted across europe to break the cycle ? 
   english is fine , as this thread shows . 
  selection bias . 
  obviously an english speaking forum is going to be dominated by english speakers . 
   good luck with esperanto being your only foreign language if your job involves international cooperation . 
  the same can be said for most european languages . 
  the idea of esperanto is that everyone will keep their native language and only use esperanto in international situations . 
   the book shows the dystopian future with a generalized language and how this might affect our identity and brain . 
   should americans , irish , canadians , australians and everyone else who speaks english as a mother tongue also go insane ? 
  english is a `` generalized '' language that was n't originally the native language of many people so did it crush their identity too ? 
  opinion polls had it at 80 % before the referendum began . 
  it dropped after that when the fear-mongering began , plus people in general are conservative about referendums and fear the unknown . 
  my interpretation : - ** sweden & denmark ** - the left wants to imitate its welfare state as its a model for a wealthy and egalitarian society . 
  - ** germany ** - probably its efficiency . 
  regardless of ideology , germans have a reputation for high quality and hard work . 
  - ** mediterranean ** - its weather . 
  we do n't want spanish unemployment , just spanish sun . 
  - ** uk ** - most irish people have little knowledge of european countries so they went with the safe option and chose the most similar country . 
  - ** eastern europe ** - i have no idea , only the catholic right admires poland, 
   marechal petain small correction , in english it 's spelt as ** marshal ** otherwise good meme, 
  is she admitting that the front national brand is so bad that even its leader is wants to distance herself from it ? 
   spicer said the president did not have the time to make a statement on all terrorism he always finds time when the attacker is muslim, 
  wow , in a thread with 3,000 comments , you found one that does . 
  you 've sure convinced me !, 
  find any from anyone who counts ? 
  the live feed is disappointingly half-hearted . 
  there 's only been a single update in the last hour . 
  why create a thread if you 're not bothered to update it ? 
  everyone ? 
  name one person . 
  because trump supporters claim its `` the last bastion of free speech '' on reddit and loudly complain about `` censorship '' whenever they get banned from any other sub . 
  does m\u00e9lenchon count as a communist ? 
  he does n't want to seize control of means of production or suspend democratic liberties , so i do n't think its anything to worry about . 
  neither , your chart shows she 's most popular among people aged 35-49 , in other words the middle aged . 
  but that 's not true . 
  her largest support group is among the middle aged . 
  her support among people aged 60-69 is almost the same as those between 18-24 . 
  she is n't particularly strong among young voters . 
  actually the poll shows that the younger you are , the more likely you are to vote for the left and the older you are , the more likely you are to vote for the right . 
  it 's not as revolutionary as you think . 
  ** bbc **  ** partial results give le pen lead **  france 's interior ministry says with 20 million votes counted , marine le pen has 24.38 % , ahead of emmanuel macron on 22.19 % . 
  fran\u00e7ois fillon has 19.63 % and jean-luc m\u00e9lechon 18.09 % . 
  that would represent about half the vote , but will not include the main cities . 
  the cities are left wing , so this is probably overstating le pen 's lead, 
  giving each country a share of the refugees is a far better solution than dumping the entire problem on greece , turkey and lebanon . 
  not sure what you mean by `` forced '' redistribution , the refugees will voluntarily leave the camps . 
  i worked in an esperanto internet office . 
  the employees were mostly volunteers from all over europe and esperanto was the working language . 
  we worked on a host of internet projects , mostly related to language learning , as well as organising events like the world congress of esperanto . 
  i did and your comment still does n't make much of a case . 
  well , yeah there 's a selection bias as only people who can speak english can join the conversation , which makes it seem much more dominant than it really is . 
  that comment does n't make much of a case . 
  i 'm not sure what you prove by saying that not all the refugees are from syria , the question of what to do is the same if they are from iraq , afghanistan etc. 
  i 'd imagine they used the example of mexican immigrants in america because there is more data on it , arab migration to europe is relatively new and small . 
  so , no i do n't think you showed how the video was propaganda , you just stated it had an opinion you did n't like . 
  are all opinion pieces propaganda ? 
  i think it 's meant as a basic introduction for people who do n't know much about the eu and want a brief explanation of the main issues . 
  hopefully they will follow it up with more in depth videos . 
  the eu definitely needs a common language , but i 'd prefer something like esperanto . 
  it 's neutral and really easy to learn , so it 's ideal for this situation . 
  it 's not as well established as other major languages , but eu support could quickly change that . 
  i think youtube sorts the section so that the comments with the most replies are towards the top , which promotes ~ ~ discussion ~ ~ controversy, 
  are we talking about the same channel ? 
  i remember that video , it was very fair , thoughtful and balanced . 
  it certainly was n't extremist and definitely did n't imply that everyone who opposed the refugees were racist . 
  that 's a really interesting video . 
  i 've noticed that i 've become much more pro-eu in the last 2-3 years . 
  i used to view europe as somewhere foreign and far away that does n't really affect my life ( in ireland we use `` europe '' to refer to mainland europe ) . 
  since then i 've done a lot of traveling around europe , made a lot of european friends and participated in eu schemes like the european voluntary service . 
  we have a lot in common and can benefit much more by working together . 
  the refugee crisis shows the need for a common policy and how we ca n't selfishly act alone . 
  it 's given me a much more positive impression of europe and made me feel european for the first time . 
  you could argue that maron is similar to hollande , but it 's nonsense to act like m\u00e9lechon is . 
  their platforms are completely different and they even ran against each other ( and were critical of each other ) in 2012, 
  when i went to san francisco , i did n't find any culture shock , it seemed very european in style and culture . 
  yes there are a couple of places across europe where you can work full time in an esperanto organisation . 
  http://tejo.org/volontulado/ i 'm working with the esperanto association of toulouse and my job is essentially to promote the language . 
  i help run events , courses , information stands , a radio show etc. 
  last year i worked in esperanto for the organisation e@i in slovakia which runs websites for learning languages ( including lernu ) and we also organised the world congress of esperanto . 
  i wrote a full account here https://whistlinginthewind.org/2016/06/08/my-life-as-an-esperanto-volunteer/, 
  i love esperanto . 
  it 's super easy to learn and has a really unique culture . 
  i 've made lots of friends and had interesting experiences with the language . 
  come join us at / r/esperanto if you want to see the language in action . 
  no the idea of equal and neutral international communication is still alive . 
   it 's also supposed to be an odyssey and exploration with the history and culture of the language going back a thousand or more years how many foreigners learning english learn about the last thousand years of its history ? 
  hell , how many american native english speakers know of the last thousand years of the language ? 
  i find it weird all the strange hurdles people create for esperanto and no other language . 
   since esperanto is an artificial langage , no one really ` thinks in esperanto ' . 
  actually i do . 
  it 's not my native language but i work in esperanto and know many people with whom i only speak esperanto ( even if they know english ) . 
  it 's as easy for me to think and express myself in esperanto as in english . 
  only outside public buildings or on projects that received eu support . 
  i 've never seen one at a parade or protest for example . 
  ** ireland ** yes there is a big urban-rural divide here . 
  left wing parties do well in the cities , especially dublin , but hardly exist in the countryside . 
  this divide was visible in the marriage equality referendum last year too , urban areas were much more likely to support it . 
  the cities are very secular , while the catholic church still has some influence in the countryside . 
  the cities would be more international in terms of demographics and media consumed , while rural areas are still almost entirely irish born and more irish focused in terms of media .
