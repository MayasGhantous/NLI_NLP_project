  oh i very much agree that road tax should be spent on roads , but it 's not , road tax is sent to central govt coffers instead . 
  and if the tax payer is n't being refunded the difference in changing water over to a utility model , than it 's just a tax by another name . 
   we 're a low tax economy demanding high tax services . 
  meh , there 's no efficiency in the delivery of services , so perhaps rather than blaming the taxpayer for demanding value for the taxes paid , again a change of perspective might be somewhat more rewarding . 
  i seem to note an underlying trend in the thinking ... 
  and who remember 's eircom 's stanglehold on the infrastructure and local loop unbundling that retarded the growth of irish broadband ? 
  while competition is good , the state has n't a great track record in implementing it successfully ( esb being the only exception i can think of ) . 
  irish water is already starting off on a high level of cost to the user , and a botched privatisation attempt would send the price upward even more meaning that once again the irish consumer would be receiving a substandard service for extremely high relative pricing . 
  and even after all that , the state would n't have the decency to reduce road tax accordingly . 
  we got ripped off enough in 2008 , hope you do n't mind if some of us say we 've had enough at this stage . 
  i know from previous posts you 've mentioned support for labour , perhaps it would be healthier for labour minded people to invest their energies in understanding the current outlook of irish society instead of justifying it 's own self harming outlook .

   ** sch\u00e4ubled : ** * to get fucked in the ass in a rough manner . 
  to a degree , but also earlier qe , more unified monetary policy and an extremely stable currency in contrast to europe . 
  there are infinite factors that could be debated which is fair , but this should n't be about who has the greater dick , but instead we should be looking at unemployment in europe with extreme concern as the rest of the world recovers from 2008 . 
  when you consider that youth unemployment is roughly twice the normal rate of employment , we really should be agitated that we now live in a union where some countries have 50 % of people under thirty who literally have no future as things stand . 
  while my initial comment was blas\u00e9 and short , it 's the reactions that i fear for most . 
  `` it 's how the us counts their statistics '' , `` the us has poorer working conditions '' , etc. . . how determined can you be to ignore such a destructive problem that is cancerously destroying living conditions in europe . 
  it is with a hint of irony that europeans now point to poor conditions in the us as a contrast while in fact the us has been making progress in areas where europe has been lagging severely . 
  yeah , let 's just ignore our own problems , and chronic unemployment . 
  it 's so much more satisfying to take cheap shots at the yanks instead . 
  i did n't know that all of europe shares a enlightened singular employment regime . 
  conversely i suppose we should ignore the introduction of the living wage in individual states to maintain our stereotyped expectations ? 
  well that 's a thriving healthy situation .

  hard to light a molotov in the pouring rain , sure you throw bricks at police and by the time they land they 've turned in to sludge , the cops get pissed off because they 're too busy using their riot shields as rain shields and all the sludge raining down on top of them is making it too heavy to hold them up . 
   the police detained 25 people , including four germans , three poles , two frenchmen , one albanian , ukrainian , dutchman and australian . 
  not content with wrecking greece through austerity , fellow europeans have travelled to greece to personally help dismantle the countries infrastructure / s, 
  ** german ** intellectual figurehead of european integration states an opinion that germany is doing damage to it 's own past work to build europe in how it is treating greece , and / r/europe lose 's it 's shit claiming it 's anti-german . 
  you have to laugh at the ridiculous jimmies being rustled , especially when you consider that j\u00fcrgen habermas has multiple lifetime 's experience over most posting here , and far more experience in building europe than the current generation tearing it down . 
  exxtennd and pretennnnnnnd !, 
  it 's not like there 's a rational structured approach to life where you can base policy upon fanciful things like experience or evidence or anything . 
  i 'm sure it will be roses this time ... third time lucky right ?!, 
  hey , we 're all hardasses when it means that greece must pay , we got our boot firmly upon their neck ... but when it comes to actually dealing with a threat ... ha !, 
  where 's all the moralising then ? 
  greeks must pay , putin ... well he can push back . . 
  a wild putin appears ... no one does anything ... yurop solidarity !, 
  * sigh ... * well perhaps we all might like a solution based on actual economics and not just petty moralising . 
   it reminded me that in german , debt , `` schuld , '' also means moral fault or blame . 
  my read would be that the push for grexit on saturday was a reaction to this report . 
  those who want no debt restructuring panicked and tried to force a deal that tsipras could never accept ... but failed to realise that no matter how bad the deal on offer he would take anything to avoid grexit . 
  it seems tusk 's intervention to stop merkel and tsipras leaving was fateful in a way that would horrify the creditors who wanted grexit to happen . 
  now all tsipras has to do is act in good faith to the deal he agreed to , the genie is out of the bottle , and while the reforms will hurt , it will be next to impossible to avoid the issue of restructuring greece 's debt . 
  interesting times ... 
  8 comments and not one person blaming russia . 
  for shame / r/europe , for shame ... i 'm disappointed in you . 
   i guarantee you that by next year , most people will have totally forgotten this ordeal and things will get back on track . 
  nothing short of a miracle would turn the greek economy around so fast . 
  this has lingered since 2008 , it shows no signs of going away . 
   just because there was some bullying going on here does n't mean that the day to day workings of the eu have been compromised . 
  i do n't know what to say to that , ah sure it was just a bit of playing around ?!? 
   also , you lamented that the outcome was n't sustainable . 
  what exactly would you classify as a sustainable solution ? 
  ** writing off greece 's debt ** would help them in the short run , but without conditions attached , there is nothing stopping them from doing it all again . 
  also , writing off their debt would likely create even more instability across the eu . 
  the turmoil that it would create amongst the people of creditor countries would be immense , it could even bring down a few governments . 
  it could be argued that writing off their debt would be the most undemocratic thing to do since the majority of the people from the creditor countries would disagree . 
  this is what confuses me , are you aware that syriza were ** not ** actually negotiating for a write-off and choose to ignore it pretending for the sake of argument that they were ? 
  or is your position based on an incomplete picture of what was being requested ? 
  even noonan came out in the end and said debt `` reprofiling '' would be needed . 
  restructuring , reprofiling , promisory notes ... debt is a complex instrument and there are many ways to manage it . 
  it might still happen , but now under the current proposed program , any debt restructuring over the long term will be so buried in short term contraction that it will be of little value in turning the greek economy around . 
  it 's worth bearing in mind that greek capacity to pay in the future is tied in with future success in growing it 's economy which makes the current short termism of winning the political battle seem so futile . 
  there 's a cruel irony in there that the national politics of individual states played a distinct part in creating this outcome in diametric opposition to the idea of pan-european solidarity . 
  were i an eu academic , i 'd be going back through the archives right now trying to see what the architects of europe thought would be the best way to avoid this situation altogether assuming they likely foresaw problems just like this . 
  hehe , but that 's what the whole house of cards is built on in so many human systems , faith in currencies , faith in government , faith in law ... i kinda phrased it that way on purpose , a reminder of what it all really is . 
  indeed it does , but there is a distinct difference between poverty brought on cyclical economies and that created by means of policy . 
  this is n't about charity , it 's about economic policy and in this case the policy is destructive . 
  further to it not being about charity , i completely agree european taxpayers should n't be paying for greece ... but alas we created a currency that has a distinct disadvantage in being unable to issue it 's own eurobonds meaning europe ca n't access the markets to raise the money needed to repair the greek economy ... hardly ideal , and far from anything to do with moral imperatives about `` charity '' . 
   no if worst comes to worse we will help for sure . 
  there was already talk about humanitarian aid going on . 
  the thing is if greece does not reform how are we ever supposed to get out of th is crisis ? 
  also i still can not really see why greek ca n't put up with reducing spending the way otehr countries did aswell ( portugal , lithuania , ireland for example ) europe can barely manage a humanitarian crisis involving a few thousand migrants per week , talk about aid for greece was just that , a minor thing to say we 're not that bad . 
  and greece did reduce spending and followed the program faithfully to the point where it lost 25 % of it 's economic capacity , if you were in there shoes how would you judge when enough is enough ? 
  could you imagine 25 % of german economic capacity and production being destroyed ? 
  it 's easy to say from the sidelines , `` why did n't they ? 
  '' , and sadly now that attitude has poisoned eu politics , and we are no better for an actual solution . 
  the austerity agenda won , greeks will `` put up '' with further spending reductions on top of existing reductions , and how the outcome can be different when doing the same thing is beyond me . 
   playing the blame game will not get us any further , neither blaming the `` lazy greeks '' or the `` evil germans '' . 
  i strongly agree , but it does n't do any good to ignore an opening divide either . 
  nice to hear a little hope in these dark days :-) but it feels as if france and italy 's power in the bloc was further marginalised by their inability to score a more substantial form of compromise . 
  perhaps they might prevail in the months and years to come to achieve this , but in recent years it feels as if they have been helpless witnesses to the crushing orthodoxy of the european right .
