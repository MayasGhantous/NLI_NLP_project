  yeah , but the complexities of politics mean that it would be more difficult to have a universal buy in after an election . 
  the opposition would n't want to stand down , the referendum was quite convenient in creating a consensus . 
  in terms of effect , only time will tell . 
   i do n't see this ending well . 
  i do n't see this ending well at all . 
  at least on that we are agreed . 
  but sadly even this is an issue , we all know it 's a negative for the currency if greece leaves , yet there is a certain bravado that runs straight on for ** full risk ** thinking that the consequences are little enough that no negotiation is needed on one side . 
  the world does n't work like that . 
  yes , someone will have to pay for compromise , and ideally we 'd have eurobonds now to obtain the funding needed for a ten year program , but we do n't . 
  and who will cry when the balance of losses is greater than if we had chosen to pay ? 
  i guess the terrible beauty of politics is that in the end no one ever wants to take responsibility for the failures , the spin will be horrifyingly hypocritical and delusional : `` we did what we thought was best at the time ... '', 
  not really , they went forward with unified front that says we 'll deal fairly as a whole if we can get it , this presents europe with an opportunity in that it can hold a pretty big stick to greece in the future when implementing reforms they agree to ( i.e. 
  this is what you wanted , you exclude yourselves from future excuses ) . 
  hopefully european leaders see the opportunity even those who are n't supportive of the greeks , an agreement with a unity group can have more long term stability regardless of who is elected in future or for that matter if any more referendums are called . 
  it 's fair to say that in this case it is an absolute necessity to be able to see opportunity where there is a challenge for the euro 's future . 
  let 's hope the meetings in brussels save us all . 
  the german 's lonesome burden is a struggle surrounded by duplicitous savages . 
  he must be strong and righteous in bearing this burden in saving the savages from themselves . 
  should n't have entered a currency union if you did n't want shared risk , and yes , the rest of the world is fed up having the $ uro sword of damocles hanging over its economic well being because euro solidarity and economic wisdom are unachievable ... must be a lack of adults in the euro ... ;-), 
  well , there 's not much we can do now . 
  it 's just a question of if in the ultimate irony the european project becomes the victim of the national politics it was meant to transcend . 
  the era of the builders of europe is behind us in the 20th century it seems . 
   ow can other countries , especially slovakia/latvia/etc . 
  continue to loan them more money at the same time they are clearly needing debt relief ? 
  that is essentially a donation from a poorer country to a wealthier country . 
  so there is a serious flaw with the design of the euro . 
   austerity is not avoidable in the case of greece . 
  when the gdp is in such a large part from government 's deficit spending , when that government has no more credit , there is no alternative but to accept the fall in gdp and make drastic cuts to spending . 
  the question is if they want a controlled austerity and to adhere to what the creditors want , or blaze into the unknown on their own revenues/currency and maybe even not have to pay back the debt . 
  i do n't know which is best , but `` no austerity '' is clearly not an option . 
  and i 'd heartily agree that there is no easy solution . 
  but the question facing europe now is that do we create a system of solidarity that helps a member suffering from the most severe economic depression in recent times , or instead are we a loose collective of individual states that will happily throw each other to the dogs when faced with difficulties . 
  the viability of the euro in to the future depends on this very answer , and deluding ourselves that the current situation is a moral one only imperils us all to suffering , not just the greeks . 
  same could be said for the european project ;-) in fairness , this sub has gone `` full yurop '' , look to your username and understand that some of us wish to be joyful polemicists in this time of uncertainty . 
  by that logic , the structural integrity of the euro should just be economic policy ... but it is n't . 
  and here we are , where the euro architects said we 'd never be . 
  meh , just enjoying the jerk while it 's going . 
  ca n't say i 'll be joining the euro skeptics anytime soon , but can say my view on the actual character of europe will be rather reserved from now on . 
  we 're all on this ride together , none of us can really do anything to change the course of events currently being decided , but our behaviour and outlook can reflect on our virtues when future generations look back on history . 
  anyone who resists our moralistic hegemon must clearly be deranged . 
  all hail the mighty empire !, 
  the rebels must be crushed . 
  too late , the european hivemind has already downvoted the dissenting view . 
  austerity needs must in the face of northern moral superiority . 
   stop being whipped by your own bloody nationality that 's rich , given that it is national politics in the conservative european north that is currently looking to eject greece in the first step to unravelling the euro . 
   we will inevitably move backward eventually . 
  we 've been back pedalling since 2008 ... forward is backward now it seems . 
  i was being facetious in referring to `` those nasty british euroskeptics '' , how dare ye go against the yurojerk ;-) it 's all getting a bit silly now is n't it , pity people are suffering for it . 
  another dissenting article downvoted to hell !, 
  uhhhyeah !, 
  the jerk is strong in this one !, 
  unnhh , downvote it , downvote it more !, 
  perfect yuropean unity !, 
  no dissenting views on perfect yurop !, 
  greeks bad , euro gud , jerk it harder !!!, 
  l $ l l $ l $ l $ \u2193 \u2193 \u2193 $ $ $ \u2193 \u2193 \u2193, 
  worse than emotionally driven ... hubristic . 
  there is only the one narrative , none other must be tolerated or discussed , do n't mention that the building is on fire ( damnit , now / r/europe has me quoting hague of all people ! ) . 
  i 'm done , ca n't say i 've ever been a euro-skeptic , or had much time for them , but there comes a point where you have to step back from a hopeless case and look aghast from the distance . 
  they have been warned repeatedly that there are serious structural flaws in the euro 's currency design , and flagellating the greeks will do nothing to resolve these flaws , in fact it will only make it worse . 
  it 's still possible to save the euro , the question is , would you rather act moralistically hubristic and kick a greek instead ? 
  in what passes for the eu ( union ? ), 
  nowadays , the answer is a resounding yes !, 
  not at all , we are all europeans in perfect solidarity within our perfect union . 
  those nasty greeks are just an aberration to our perfect union , once we cut them out , our perfect union will be whole again , and we will return to our eternal brotherly european solidarity . 
  germans and spanish , finn 's and italians , portuguese and dutch ... all perfect brothers !!!, 
  good morning / r/europe , are we looking forward to another day of kicking greeks for the insecurities of our own poorly designed currency ?!? 
  i hope so , yesterday was so fun !, 
  my pants are off , my body is ready !, 
  let 's start this circlejerk !, 
  good to see we 've started by downvoting this non-approved opinion piece by those nasty british euroskeptics !, 
  why they would be critical of our euroway of destiny , is beyond reason !!!, 
  how dare they question our perfect currency union !, 
  are you naive enough to think i 'm greek ? 
  but hey , you can go rub one out now that you 're all hard and stiff from a bit of moral grandstanding , do n't mind me , 
  a heartfelt post gets downvoted to fuck , it 's representative of something , and it ai n't positive . 
  to quote the op :  it 's suddenly like your friends reavealing that they actually hated you from the start . 
  it 's a really bad feeling . 
  ai n't that a kick in the head , or maybe it was a case that european solidarity was just an illusion in the first place . 
  heh , / r/yurop is less of a circlejerk than this place at the moment . 
  greeks bad , euro gud , all aboard the karma train !!, 
  o o o o o __ | [ _ ] | __ ___________ _______ ____ o | [ ] [ ] [ ] | [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ _____ ( __ ] [ ] ] _ n_n __ ] [ . 
  lol , choo !, 
   until then , this is just an idiotic cheap shot at the germans . 
  no , that would be throwing euros at them . 
  le cool !, 
  are n't we yuropeans so lucky to be strong in character , ubermensch one and all !!!, 
  one people , one yuro !, 
  it 's going perfectly , no one is upvoting to save the euro !, 
  just like the real europe !, 
  ah , but this is / r/europe and they must [ suffer !, 
  as they say in france : `` le le le le le austerity ! '', 
  nope , i say it because i 've read a history long ago that the eu structures were influenced by french design , and i certainly do n't say it as if to say that france is a badly-run country !!!, 
  modern europe is administered by highly intelligent people who are based in a small centralized geographic area of europe that has nothing in common with the periphery , and the administration takes place affecting individual citizens with no local or direct interfaces by which citizens can feed back in to the system when they are negatively affected by directives applied at the national level . 
  no doubt it is , but : * does any of that change the structural realities of an attempted monetary union that has no political union ? 
  * does it change the fact that the eu looked the other way as goldman sachs helped greece fudge it 's economic data to get in ? 
  * does it change the fact that the eu failed ** completely ** to enforce deficit targets before 2008 ? 
  * does it change the diversification of ez member bond rates that happened after 2008 and the still non-existent eurobond ? 
  * does it change the fact that periphery economies do not exist in the same realm as core economies ? 
  * does it change the fact that we have a single currency attempting to serve the requirements of 19 different economies .
