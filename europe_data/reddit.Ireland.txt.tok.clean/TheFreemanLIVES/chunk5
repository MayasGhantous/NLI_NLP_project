  viva la self defeat !, 
  leaving the ez is not the same as leaving the eu . 
  greece would no longer deal in euros , but all the same problems would still be part of the eu , and add to that we 'd suddenly have a belligerent member state proxying for russia in the eu . 
  [  ] ( https://youtu.be/q8swmaqyqf0?t=17 ), 
   schooling you any further . 
  you had nothing to teach it seems . 
  wisdom comes from within , think about it , 
   ^ real ^ wages ^ rose ^ by ^ around ^ 72 % ^ from ^ their ^ low ^ point ^ in ^ 2003 ^ to ^ 2013, 
  you 're cute when you 're angry   the socio-economic situation in argentina has been steadily improving . 
  the economy nearly doubled from 2002 to 2011 , growing an average of 7.1 % annually and around 9 % for five consecutive years between 2003 and 2007 . 
  [ 3 ] even using higher private inflation estimates , real wages rose by around 72 % from their low point in 2003 to 2013 . 
  [ 39 ] the global recession did affect the economy in 2009 , with growth slowing to nearly zero ; [ 3 ] but high economic growth then resumed , and gdp expanded by around 9 % in both 2010 and 2011 . 
  [ 3 ] foreign exchange controls , austerity measures , persistent inflation , and downturns in brazil , europe , and other important trade partners , contributed to slower growth beginning in 2012 , however . 
  [ 40 ] growth averaged just 1.3 % from 2012 to 2014 . 
  [ 2 ] i love it when german 's get angry : https://youtu.be/q8swmaqyqf0?t=17, 
  you have n't supplied a single link or economic reference the entire time :-) bai-bai wurstsucker !, 
  [ basics ? 
  actually argentina recovered in the space of six years , how 's greece doing 7 years since 2008 ? 
  apples and oranges , but the gdp does n't lie , greece 's protracted decline is unique compared to countries that have suffered similar shocks . 
  austerity is a false doctrine , based on false [ data ] ( http://www.epi.org/blog/reinhart-rogoff-couldnt-justify-austerity/ ) , which has wrecked [ havoc ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2015/apr/28/austerity-cuts-social-care-suffering-election ) , and is now leading to policy which is creating the current crisis as well as laying an ideological [ policy ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/12/academics-attack-george-osborne-budget-surplus-proposal ) for future crisis . 
  so believe what you want , just understand that the pain of gaining this experience means your opinion counts for shit in the current context . 
  you were speaking of facts ? 
  and you can pretend that downvoting me in a one to one conversation means anything :-) you state facts , yet this conversation is based on a what if , this tell 's me your assertions are a lie . 
  south america , different context , different economy . 
  try harder . 
  on what basis and for whom ? 
  worse for the eurozone banks that lent to greece without consideration of risk ? 
  worse for the ez and a currency built on unsound economic principles ? 
  are you saying it could be worse for the greeks ? 
  how ? 
  instability ? 
  starvation ? 
  unemployment ? 
  worse , how ? 
  what gives you the insight as to what could have been ? 
   back then a default would have been much worse . 
  worse as in their gdp could have contracted 25 % ? 
  the default would have been worse for the euro , on the other hand greece 's correction would now be over and they would be a few years in to their nascent recovery . 
  aye , but those aussie cunts turned cunt around to mean alright as opposed to just being a cunt . 
   the terror threat facing the uk is the highest the head of mi5 has seen in his 32-year career and `` shows no sign of abating '' . 
  \u00d3_\u00f3 might it not have been higher when ira bombs were a regular feature of british life or was that just a statistical anomaly ? 
  how about 7/7 ? 
  or is this just another civil servant hyping up his justification to spend fucktonnes and grow their department ... history seems to show that profit correlates with threat , the realism of threat has little to do with the same correlation . 
  in fact i might even take the chance to say that the viking threat facing the uk is the highest i have ever seen , and indeed shows no sign of abating while the nordics pump out death metal ( \u00ac \u00ac ) \\ m /, 
  so the exploratory mission to eastern ukraine was part of a peaceful russian space expansion program after all . 
  soon we 'll enjoy the sight of little green men landing on the moon . 
  well if you 're rich enough you can just send them off until they return in their adulthood as emotional wrecks with parental insecurities ... it 's worked for generations of rich people already . 
  ranch peasants bow down before your glorious hot sauce master race !, 
  ahh , so after spending the last 5 years defining european politics through the prism of the german 2017 elections , it might turn out to have been all for nothing after all . 
  then is it not insanity to maintain shroedingers currency ? 
  again , i 'm arguing against the euro ... unwinding it would be a nightmare , but it 's not the kind of thing you can be ethereal about , we either have a solid currency resilient to shock or we do n't . 
  the lisbon treaty has gone someway to providing the tools to resolve some of the issues , but there is still a lack of political will and eight years on is now bordering on the maliciously negligent . 
  in many ways , the likes of le pen and farage are a symptom of political failure instead of being the actual cause . 
   what matters now is fixing it in the fastest and ** fairest ** way possible so we can move on . 
  fully agree but leadership over the last 8 years has been atrocious , and the political culture of the european center right has n't changed enough to resolve the issues . 
  there is no reason that i 'm aware of that we ca n't have eurobond 's already , and on that basis once we have eb 's , we 'll have a mechanism to fund the likes of italy and greece when it goes tits up without dipping in to the pockets of german taxpayers . 
  i 'm not anti-euro , but there are serious structural issues with it as a currency , and speaking of legitimate criticism , every time you point it out , this sub automatically stereotypes you as a frothing at the mouth farangi . 
  key thing is , and this is n't about blame , it 's more about our future ability to handle contingencies such as deutsche bank and italy going tits up is that europe is n't changing fast enough not to repeat the same mistakes of the last 8 years . 
  the lessons of brexit and the seriousness of losing one of the big 12 seems to be lost in the politics of the epp centrist right that has charted the course to this disastrous outcome in the first place . 
  schengen has been broken through their inability to understand that removal of internal borders requires an orderly maintenance of an external one ( statecraft 101 ) . 
  i really despair for the future of ** our ** european project . 
  the values of unity , trade and peace are well worth it , but sadly unity has been tossed overboard in the face of throwaway remarks about intransigent greeks and an inability to hold everyone to equal account . 
   not lying on the euro application helped by goldman as germany and the commision looked the other way . 
   enforcing a tax collecting culture . 
  italy ... 
  i 'll never understand why people are so keen to throw stones in this european glass house ... 
   if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little `` clever '' comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue . 
  but you could n't , you did n't , and now you 're paying the price , you goddamn idiot . 
  i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it . 
  you 're fucking dead , kiddo . 
  heh , it 's / r/europe :-) anything against the grain brings down the fury ;-), 
  no , the euro artificially forced bond yields ( not interest rates , get it right ) together forcing an economic mirage that came tumbling down in 2008 revealing major weaknesses in the design of the currency . 
  and when you say cheaper debt , is n't it telling that even in an era of negative interest rates , investors would rather pay interest for security than actually invest money in the markets . 
  sorry , you 're way out of your depth here . 
  wow , you got me there . 
   i will agree a lot of the countries in it have abysmal economic policies but that has nothing to do with the euro . 
  [ it has everything to do with the ** euro ** ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-v38gnvzpkwu/t9-dl6acz-i/aaaaaaaabiu/6wbnzafwrao/s1600/yields+before+after.png ) greece 's economic data was falsified with knowledge from the eu to facilitate it 's entry in to the ez , italy is teetering and not much better . 
  the ez knew about the `` abysmal economic policies '' and let them in anyway , and since then the ez has kicked the can down the road to avoid facing up to it 's own failure in creating a structurally deficient currency that has no currency union like the us , or one for that matter ca n't issue it 's own eurobonds meaning that a financial crisis in athens becomes a domestic political issue in berlin . 
  it 's all there right in front of your face , yet you do n't want to see it . 
  eurostat will be interested to hear from you . 
  ** ok ** , how about portugal ? 
  13 % unemployment rate / 28.6 % unemployment rate . 
  how about greece ? 
  25.6 % unemployment rate / 50.4 % unemployment rate . 
  italy ? 
  12.4 % unemployment rate / 36.9 % unemployment rate . 
  [ success !, 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pnhfpwl.png ) again , ** hard facts ** that people just do n't want to like much less acknowledge . 
  is / r/europe a milder version of / r/the _ donald ? 
  edit : also , the informal economy is not an indicator of positive economic growth . 
  informal economies are predominantly a feature of developing poorer economies , and participants in the informal economy earn less than they would in a normal developed economy and are more prone to poverty . 
  i do , but they hardly matter here on reddit . 
  they people we pay to have ideas have six figure salaries , and are meant to make a difference to the quality of life of the people on this continent . 
  the hard numbers of unemployment indicate nothing but failure , regardless of how you or i think about it . 
  there 's no escaping the simple truth that stands before us . 
  what does it matter how would i improve the situation , i 'm hardly a member of the eurogroup now am i ? 
  sorry , but that 's a bs reply , my knowledge on the subject hardly makes a difference to the outcome when the people tasked with the responsibility for the crisis in the first place failed to achieve a more positive outcome . 
  that 's the one and only metric that matters here , while most us states have unemployment down around 5 % , europe has crippled an entire generation in it 's periphery for the sake of domestic politics in germany . 
  why is this so hard to accept for people ? 
  sorry , but this is absolutely pathetic , and a damning indictment of ez economic policy over the last 8 years .
