  spanish youth unemployment is a ** whopping ** [ 43.9 % ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/266228/youth-unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/ ) edit : look 's like i 'm flying lead balloons with simple statistical facts . 
  / r/europe a place for critical thought ... anyone to argue how periphery unemployment and youth unemployment figures are actually an ez policy success ? 
  anyone ? 
  update : jimmies rustled and downvotes galore by factual unemployment data and outstanding economic failure in the ez ... seeing as how in touch with reality / r/europe is , how about we set the subreddit slogan : `` make europe great again '' no one has yet explained how periphery unemployment and youth unemployment figures are somehow good news as this thread presents it instead of the massively outstanding failure that it actually represents for the millions suffering from it ? 
  8 years on from the financial crisis , and this is somehow good ? 
  in ireland everything bar a fraudulent claim is excluded from insurance . 
  looks like team rocket are taking off aga ^ a ^ a ^ a ^ i ^ i ^ n, 
  yeah , we had an election earlier this year and his party made him director of elections because they knew they would n't do well ... he 's a useful idiot for them . 
  i 'm irish , this guy is known for being full of shit . 
  also given there 's a veto on these types of things , he 's bursting at the seams full of shit . 
  they should remove him from the eu parliament buildings before he explodes . 
  [ he 's not often seen ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/d/d8/emperor_sidious.png ), 
  there 's the thing tho , what 's right is n't always fair . 
  ultimately the future of europe and the necessary pragmatism to make it happen is core to the survival of europe . 
  i do n't give a damn for the uk , or any deal they get , but greece has proven that tokenistic fairness to appease the german taxpayer only made the problem worse as borne out by the imf 's change in stance on debt forgiveness . 
  this is n't about fairness , we know that well in ireland given the hit we took on junior bondholder debt , this is about doing what is necessary to make the eu work , survive and thrive . 
  there is no normal , there is no special deals , there is strictly only what it takes to ensure we get europe back on track . 
  solidarity can be ruthlessly pragmatic when it needs to be . 
   i think europe will be fine more or less . 
  can we afford that assumption however ? 
  two statistics , youth unemployment in the ez is way beyond unacceptable , and unemployment overall in the us is way below that of europe . 
  europe will only be fine if you and i make a political point of ensuring that europe is cared for . 
  the current status quo only encourages failure , it wo n't be fine until the stats tell us that we 've emerged from the unacceptable present . 
   but i am amused how panicky the uk sound once they realized the consequences of their decision . 
  momentous decision , at this point in time no one is sure who 'll be hit . 
  ireland for instance has massive trade with the uk ... we still do n't know how we 'll fair , and wo n't know for years yet . 
  but we should be all panicky , the uk should indeed be worried about the outcome especially considering that an expectation that remain would win was confounded by the inability to read the public . 
  and the eu should be panicky that such a large economy has left . 
  this is massive , it 's bigger than you and me , our opinions , and even our inherent emotional reactions to who did what . 
  this is our chance as europeans to define the europe we want and make it work , the european visionaries of the 20th century raised the bar in terms of what europe can be , we should look to their example and return to the core of the project which is unity , consensus , and pragmatism that makes europe succeed in spite of its differences , in fact it once thrive on it 's differences . 
  we are not a homogenous continent , and prior to maastricht onwards , we built an institution that celebrated those differences ... fuck ... i miss the old days :-(, 
  what really upsets me is that outlooks such as ours are very much pro-european ... but many of our comrades take our critical attitude as being anathema to the cause of europe . 
  for fucks sake !, 
  i want europe to return to it 's past glory days , not die a prolonged death from fragmentation . 
  it 's not a crime to be constructively critical of a good cause , especially when you want to see it succeed . 
  in fact this is how we better ourselves in the most honest way , something is badly amiss when this is taken as heresy :-(, 
  well , yesterday was the cataclysmic event to end all other events , the last warning for our leaders to sit up and take note . 
  hollande kind of got it ... but who listens to him :( in anycase , no more kicking the can down the road , no more chances , we save europe or we suffer badly over the coming decades as it rips itself apart . 
  literally do or die . 
  it 's not so black and white , and i remember a time in the not so distant past that europeans prided themselves on being able to understand the subtlety involved in doing what is right . 
  this hardline black/white is just the kind of thing we castigated the americans for in the 90s . 
  no , this is n't about teaching anyone a lesson about stepping out of line , this is about europe and pragmatism , and striking the best possible balance as the foundation of europe was built upon . 
  anything else stains the once proud vision of europe that it 's founders fought so hard for . 
  this `` teach them a lesson '' bullshit is anti-european as anti-european as the ukip , afd , nfl bullshit . 
  we need to step back and be the better ideal . 
  gobshite , i 'm irish , i 'm most definitely in !, 
  i 'm sick of shitty attitudes like yours , i want europe to survive !!!, 
  you 're not helping , you 're not helping a fucking thing . 
  a magnitude 9 earthquake stuck europe last night , and all petty emotions go by the wayside in that we need to make europe something that people actually want , not a bastion of shitty smugness and mundane hubris . 
  pull yer head out of your ass , ** our ** future depends on it !, 
  while it is wise to be mindful of the difficulties faced by leaders , it is also the case that we can no longer afford not to call for it to be fixed . 
  it 's time for all who see value in the eu to stand together and demand the changes necessary to fix it . 
  i find that those strongly in favor of europe tend to spend more time explaining and making excuses for it rather than just desiring that the project save itself . 
  sure the eu is a rational entity that runs itself well , but when you lose contact with the very people who you think you 're serving you get what we saw today , and worse still threats from the likes lfn and afd in the future . 
  attitudes need to change , perspective needs to accommodate that how things look near the centre look different from further out , and that we can no longer blithely just write off voters turning towards the right wing populists as if they are lost causes . 
  europe worked in the past because visionary leaders saw the potential and did everything humanly possible to connect the continents people and governments in spite of more entrenched differences in the aftermath of the war . 
  surely it is not unreasonable to ask that the same be tried again . 
  i live in hope diminished by the words of junker and schulz , but hope nonetheless . 
  it 's a symptom because the breakdown of solidarity and leadership in the eu since the financial crisis has fed it . 
  and maybe germany stepped up , but that does n't make germany 's choices any better . 
  in any case , turn it around now , or watch it die . 
  continuing on with the same shitty attitudes only guarantees further disintegration . 
  today was the clarion call ... dare eu heed it ? 
  ahh , so in a vacuum of leadership , we should follow the most hardheaded ... despite the dismal track record since 2008 ? 
  seems legit . 
  we should stop bickering , i want to see europe return to it 's former glory , the direction of the last eight years has fragmented europe instead of saving it . 
  brexit and the anti-eu reactionaries are a symptom , not a cause . 
  and now the contagion is spreading to other countries . 
  we do n't need a glorious leadership of europe , we need a return to consensus and vision . 
   i wish we were that grey boring country again that nobody could find on a map . 
  flanders infiltrator detected !, 
   the uk leaving might be the wake up call the eu needs to finally reform . 
  i hope so , but the likes of junker hanging around like a bad smell torpedos this . 
  i 've been extremely critical of the eu in recent years , but now is the time to finally get to grips with why it 's worth saving , and just what type of eu we want to see ... a vision worth realising , as it used to be and should be . 
  it 's a tried and tested method !, 
  ^ ^ fails ^ ^ every ^ ^ time ... ^ ^ guaranteed !, 
  i 'm gobsmacked at some of the comments above : * hardline attitudes rip eu apart ... * * must persist with hardline attitudes ... will surely work this time * it 's bloody insanity , especially to those of us who want to see europe turn around after a decade almost lost . 
  wtf is wrong with people . 
  europe is doomed so long as the likes of junker and schaeuble have a say , the madness must stop and the vision return . 
  lawyers in ireland and official correspondence has an unexplained habit of capitalising every word , rumour has it , it was to piss off the english . 
  lock her up ? 
  when schaeuble says it , i imagine tanks not diplomacy . 
  i 'd much rather hear it from schulz who 's probably already said it anyway . 
  [ may is a bit of an unfortunate character ] ( http://www.natural-homeremedies.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/running-water.jpg ), 
  they 're unsure if they should trigger the unsubscribe button or not , but at least now they 'll have to have a debate about it . 
  to hell with that , time to take / r/europe to the international centre for settlement of investment disputes for denying me my right to extract dank resources !, 
  ahh , well ... that makes the bailout all the more worse then . 
  worse still they ignored numerous chances to patch the problems choosing an all or nothing approach instead ... seems the gamble was just that and the odds are sliding against everyone . 
  same as that 350 million pounds a week then . 
  ideally we would have recognised the structural issues with the euro when the crisis began and not just blithely assumed that further federalisation was the way to begin a credit union and sale of ecb bonds . 
  there are plenty of proposals that could make partial progress towards these requirements without federalisation . 
  europe should be in consolidation mode , but the leaders of the crisis have failed to see this , and now we risk total failure as a result . 
  the european central bank 's supervisory arm has rejected a request from rome to delay a private sector-led rescue for monte dei paschi di siena , leaving italy little option but to inject state funds and impose losses on creditors . 
  mps asked the ecb for an extra five weeks to pull off a last-ditch $ 5bn equity injection for the lender , which emerged as the weakest in the european bank health check this summer and had already burnt through $ 8bn in equity in the past four years . 
  bankers and politicians had wanted to avoid forcing losses on some debt holders as required under new eu rules on government bailouts of financial institutions . 
  but the ecb feared that if the situation at mps were left unresolved it could lead to a systemic crisis across italy 's banking system , according to people briefed on the deliberations . 
  the board of the single supervisory mechanism , the ecb unit charged with banking regulation , made the decision to reject mps 's request at a meeting on friday , the people said . 
  a spokesman for the ecb declined to comment . 
  italy 's treasury also declined to comment .
