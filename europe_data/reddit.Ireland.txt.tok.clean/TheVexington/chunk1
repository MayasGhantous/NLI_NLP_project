  ill be honest , there are a lot of people who do n't want to legalize it here .

  a friend of mine in lyon said she secretly supports le pen , along with most of her sisters and brother .

  step 1 : give more power to the president . 
  step 2 : imprison anyone who disagrees . 
  step 3 : block social media when things go bad .

  well its nice to see something like this after all of that turkish news ... 
  i tend to disagree , if there are benefits to integration , then it will happen . 
  `` britain has long opposed anything that resembled a european military command '' with the uk leaving , it will allow for the eu to integrate further without making sure the uk does n't get upset with every minor change . 
  the uk leaving is allowing for further integration with much more ease than before . 
  [ how do you do , fellow eu kids ? 
  no hate , i just really am not really a fan of this map , looks like it was drawn with ms paint . 
  it is much more complicated than that , heck we ca n't even figure out water charges in 3 years !, 
   the ivory tower effect . 
  explain ? 
  are you a fan of less bureaucracy ? 
  less government employees ? 
  `` with an emphasis on holding regular dialogue on political issues , including human rights '' also another good reason , lets export our european values .

  31st of march is the deadline for invoking article 50 , getting official talks with the eu started .

  citi already employs 2,500 in dublin , and the irish times quoted him saying : `` it 's been a great experience and when we take a look at different aspects of our business currently in dublin , there will be some things that we 'll move [ to ireland ] . '', 
  you didnt have to call us `` idiots '' :(, 
  perhaps , i see a lot of comments which are `` pushing it a bit '' .

   a 66 % increase in navigation spending the navigation budget fed mainly by the the 28-nation european union , increases by 65.8 percent in 2017 compared to 2016 . 
  the european commission owns the galileo positioning , navigation and timing network . 
  in 2017 esa will be responsible for contracting for another eight or 12 galileo satellites and launching four already-ordered galileo spacecraft aboard a heavy-lift ariane 5 rocket . 
  long live erdoganstan ? 
  long live eu trade ? 
  i 'm sure it will be grand !, 
  hopefully not a violent mess . . 
  it is interesting actually , a lot of people that i have spoken to just refuse to think that its going to happen . 
  `` maybe if we just do n't think about it , its not going to happen ! '', 
  always happy to see a new caspian report . 
  the eu and nato have experienced the largest period of peace in modern history . 
  perhaps the real possibility of losing those securities will cause enough of the european population and their leaders to pull together and solve our most pressing problems . 
  i am sure they will do just fine !, 
  right ? 
  ` turkey have the right to military intervention in cyprus should its integrity be threatened . 
  the greek cypriots want to scrap these provisions '' this may be the closest that we have come to a solution ... but turkey may not see an incentive to give concessions , its not like they are going to join the eu any time soon .

  not sure why this is on / r/europe , but i enjoyed it . 
  the uk has for a long time opposed many new developments in the eu . 
  with the uk finally leaving , it could allow for the eu to integrate further without making sure the uk does n't get upset with every minor change . 
  would you say the uk leaving is allowing for further european integration with much more ease than before ? 
  or is it creating a more uncertain future for the eu ?

  thousands of uk citizens also want to go to spain all the time .

  i wanted the uk to take a leading role in making external eu borders stronger . 
  but then you guys just left , and now northern ireland could have a border . 
  well , at least immigration is down ?

  terrible for everything else . 
  sometimes even exports . 
  i really hope he replies . 
  especially to explain why he said  `` musk should know well that one does not fuck with the eu . '',
