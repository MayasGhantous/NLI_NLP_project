as someone who knows fuck all about anything , what did the uk do differently to lead to this employment rise ? 
  just wondering , how do people not start getting pissed and throwing shit at the car or something ? 
  i mean people should n't do this but i 'm surprised people do n't . 
  no but you do need to inform people that there is a change in a banknote so people do n't think it 's fake etc. 
  the polish are awesome . 
  well a lot of reddit is a anti-usa circlejerk as well . 
  there 's no point in not being critical of russia just because everyone else is being critical . 
  i mean what do you expect people to start posting all the nice things about russia ? 
  when the major things going on there at the moment are things to be very `` critical '' about . 
  why did the government do it again ? 
  are they actually that stupid or is there another reason ? 
  people always say this and it makes me wonder why other countries do n't implement more hydro . 
  in college i learned a lot about renewable energy from solar and wind but very little about hydro . 
  anyone know why this might be ? 
  surely a constantly flowing river is a lot more reliable than intermittent solar or wind . 
  in ireland we had a huge drop off of road deaths since 1990 . 
  my guess is its due to better roads ( this is definitely one ) , harsher penalties for bad driving , road safety ads and it is much less sociably acceptable to drink-drive or speed than it was back then . 
   it should n't have any say in anything . 
  a bit overboard do n't you think ? 
  dying out is n't the right way to put it really . 
  our population is ( might be ) getting smaller which i know is considered economically a bad thing but i 've always wondered why ? 
  less people means more houses for everyone , less oil/coal burnt for energy , more food to go around , less traffic ... the list goes on . 
  i mean people talk about less ` growth ' and less people buying things but surely that just means less stuff has to be made which should happen anyway with less people to work . 
  i mean the only thing i can think of is old people need to be supported but surely that 's not that big a deal ? 
  edit : on another note i 'm not sure about this but it 's not like it 's in anyway likely we will ever die out by people having too few babies as there will always be some ` weirdos ' ( just in this context ) having babies thus those babies will share this ` weird ' trait to continue having babies and evolution will work out the rest . 
  if you get what i mean . 
  anyone who has genes pointing towards not reproducing in this society will die out . 
  i know very little about international politics but to me a european military collaboration is a terrible idea . 
  first off surely most people here are against war ? 
  if so then why build a bigger army ? 
  keep armies small and local and thus any conflict will be small and local . 
  i feel like there is such a disconnect at the moment between the people fighting/working in wars and the reasons for them . 
  i mean it seems obvious to me that a bigger army = a worse war with more people fighting for reasons that do n't affect them . 
  once again i know little about anything to do with politics/military stuff . 
  well good news at last . 
   anyone care to explain what will happen to all our debt now ? 
  people have been telling me that we will be paying for the mistakes during the boom for 20 years because of our debt . 
  what truth is there to this ? 
  well as i said for one how irish is taught in primary schools is clearly not working well . 
  for example french/german students learn to speak english quite well by the time they are 13 , 14 . 
  whereas most people who i went to secondary school with had no interest in learning irish and could n't say much more that `` is mise thread_water '' . 
  now i am no expert in teaching at all but if i were to guess i 'd say there should be a lot more concentration on speaking irish than reading those stupid stories . 
  as i also said if they had just played an hour of cartoons to us in primary school we would know more irish . 
  i mean for junior cert irish i was learning off poetry when i could n't even say common things . 
  and i was not even close to the worst in my school . 
  now other than irish my views are pretty different than most and i admit i could be completely wrong . 
  but i think kids in primary school should be taught a lot differently . 
  now i 'm not talking about reading , writing or maths as they are done well enough . 
  but everything else is fairly shite . 
  i think the idea of kids being taught by one 40 - 30 year old teacher for the whole year to be stupid . 
  i think there should be a larger variety of things taught by a more variable group of people . 
  now in what way this is done i do n't know but smarter people who are in charge of education should be coming up with ideas . 
  i really do n't think money is the big issue if you ask me . 
  there should be a big overhaul of both the primary school teaching and the secondary . 
  i mean i was taught irish for 11 years and yet i ca n't say more than a few sentences . 
  obviously this is somewhat my fault but i mean even if no one taught me irish and instead i watched an hour of irish cartoons a week for 11 years i 'd think that i 'd no a lot more than i do now . 
  so something is clearly wrong there . 
  could n't care less * should have went to school in ireland . 
  only joking just could n't let it pass . 
  well that 's unfortunate but even though our education system is very poor , so are most countries and if you look at most rankings ireland actually comes up pretty good . 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/dec/07/world-education-rankings-maths-science-reading ) and [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_index ) . 
  obviously these are n't true reflections but i mean i really think we do n't have as bad education system ( relatively ) as people think . 
  read the article it 's not `` all '' we have to offer . 
  well one of quite a few reasons actually . 
  but yeah probably a pretty big reason . 
  people now smoke the rolling tobacco amberleaf here all the time because it 's much cheaper . 
  morten l\u00d8kkegaard - 80 % group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe 67 %, 
  it really does n't seem like this is in any way likely to me . 
  yes your right . 
  you seem to be making the same point i was trying to make . 
  that 's because it is a strong word . 
  hating ** all ** roma is racist . 
  hating some roma does not automatically make you racist . 
  oh i never realized the empties had to be brought back to the supermarket . 
  that actually seems like a great idea . 
  ok so who are these investors though ? 
  like is it just random rich people from random countries or who ? 
  ireland owes a good few billion my question is , what people will actually get this money ? 
  i have a ( probably stupid ) question . 
  who do we owe this debt too ? 
  not what banks or what countries , but what people specifically ? 
  who is now at a loss because of loaning to all these countries ? 
  ca n't imagine us doing this if england did n't also . 
  why not do both ? 
  and ireland is a teddy bear . 
  [ ireland ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb4iq46mot1qalrffo1_500.jpg ), 
  well i 'd say it said beef in the ingredients all though i do n't know . 
  if its not labeled as horse meat it should n't contain horse meat . 
  simple as that . 
  cheers pal . 
   in fact quite the opposite , so knowing that it will have a net negative impact on your citizens , why would anyone be so keen to do it ? 
  people often do nice things ( help each other out ) despite it being detrimental to themselves . 
  ( give money to charities , fight for somebody else 's war , give someone a lift ) . 
  we all have a limit on how much of a negative impact helping has , after which we stop . 
  you would n't let a homeless person sleep in your house but maybe at your doorstep , you might give money to charity but never your own lunch money ) . 
  we all have this limit so this immigration debate is simply about choosing this limit . 
  just remember that if you force someones hand in choosing how much to help they no longer feel like they are being helpful and feel robbed . 
  edit : downvotes ? 
  why ? 
   and its never `` let 's kill their ** innocents ** '' or shit like that , not even for islamic extremists .
