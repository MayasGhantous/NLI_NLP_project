  but it seems you are not . 
  you misunderstood what i said . 
  yes that 's why burglary is illegal . 
  it does affect others . 
  and i 'm not saying that the heroin use did n't cause this burglary . 
  i think we should discourage drugs , i just do n't think we should lock people in a cage for it . 
  what about the other junkie who does n't rob people 's houses ? 
  should he get locked up just because other people are being dopes ? 
  `` i do n't think people should do this even though it does n't affect me , so no one is allowed do it without being locked up '' . 
  fucking hate this mentality . 
  if you do n't like it do n't do it . 
  i know right ? 
  `` germany is burning . '', 
  really ? 
  germany is burning ? 
  this is propaganda and that 's a fact . 
  it 's even worse that 50 % + of reddit do n't read the article . 
  immigration is a big issue and if you ask me both sides of the argument are being stupid . 
  i know . 
  it 's just there was a time i was one of the youngest people on the net , now that i 'm older i often forget that there are actually millions of kids and teenagers on the net and not everyone is my age . 
  alcohol abuse is definitely a problem among college students ( and others obviously ) but i do n't know why it was compared to fees ? 
  i mean they are completely separate issues . 
  anyhow i always suggest banning alcohol advertisements , we know they work so why allow them ? 
  you forget that there are kids on the internet . 
  people have to learn these things sometime in their lives and nowadays it can often happen on the internet . 
   how our own society is changing due to fear and xenophobia . 
  but this is something that immigration causes/exacerbates . 
  this is something that can happen when two completely different cultures live in the same place . 
  it 's dangerous and could create violence from either immigrants or the locals . 
  yep , and ireland do n't look like they are going to win it after last nights match . 
  still though hopefully they get their act together . 
  ca n't wait to smash the french next week in rugby :p, 
  this is quite bizarrely hilarious . 
   not sure how anyone can think we 're a sovereign nation when we rely on the uk for defence we will always rely on others for our defence as we simply are n't capable of maintaining a military even close to a competitive level . 
  so if we ca n't be sovereign whilst relying on others for our defence then we can never be sovereign . 
   i 'm not sure how seriously anyone can take our commitment to the eu very seriously with our apparent disregard for the integrity of our eastern european partners we have committed to many parts of the eu and we have pushed against many others . 
  anyone who thinks we are fully committed to the eu is wrong regardless of our thoughts on our eastern european partners . 
  wholeheartedly against an eu army , as is most people i discuss it with . 
  fortunately you are the minority in ireland :p, 
  maybe they 're just * that * doubtful of an eu army ? 
  i knew us or the uk would be at the bottom of this . 
  americans living there presumably ? 
  i think it 's just a way to garner attention for the ad . 
  the ultimate goal being to get people to vote . 
  yes . 
  the worst is when an article on a burqa banning law being considered is posted and you the top comments are always in support of it . 
  it 's like people ca n't make the connection with being against something and not making it illegal . 
  their wives hate it , and they prioritise sex over porn . 
  but watching porn under 18 is not illegal as far as i 'm aware ? 
  so what 's the reason for this ? 
  irelands for those interested . 
  above the eu average . 
   the overall prevalence of cigarette smoking in 2014 was 19.5 % . 
  this compares to 21.5 % for 2013 . 
  this equates to over 70,000 fewer smokers in 2014 compared to 2013 . 
   a higher percentage of men ( 21.6 % ) reported being smokers than women ( 17.6 % ) . 
  i realize this . 
   no they would n't , they respect the laws of the country . 
  the question is do they respect these laws more than their religious laws ? 
  some likely would not . 
  yeah if it was phrased , `` cultural life ** can be ** undermined by immigrants '' i would agree with it . 
  too much data to take in haha . 
  [ it looks like the french like claiming benifits to which they are not entitled .

  fucking love this movie . 
  in no way do i trust the us government . 
  i do n't even think americans should trust the us government . 
  they are spying on their own citizens for christs sake . 
  this does n't mean we should n't take their opinions into consideration . 
  we should of course recognize that they will be prioritizing their goals over ours , just like we our priotizing ours over theirs . 
   i do n't really care , of course they 'll think that because it limits their influence . 
  our goals are not the same . 
  well i think the only way to improve things is to work together . 
  our goals are not the same but that does n't mean we ca n't work together to ensure we do n't trample over each other trying to reach our goals . 
  the fact that you do n't care if they have valid reasons is just plain stupid . 
   on this issue , absolutely . 
  extremely stupid attitude . 
  global relations is what has allowed us to have relative peace since ww2 . 
  ignoring other nations is the first step to undoing this . 
  no but does that mean we do n't take their opinion into consideration ? 
  what if they have valid reasons it 's a bad idea ? 
  or what if we are damaging relations with them to the point that it 's not worth it ? 
  are you seriously saying that we should just ignore the opinions of everyone outside the eu ? 
  in no way are the opinions of other nations irrelevant in such a decision . 
  me either , not a very popular opinion on this sub but i 'd love to know what the average people think from european countries . 
  i know it would be extremely unpopular here . 
  people are fairly reserved here in ireland but that 's comical . 
  like some sort of 2 meter rule or something . 
  that 's an excellent point i had n't thought of . 
  probably explains switzerland 's low number . 
  yeah that combined with the fact that we 're more affected by the north atlantic drift and thus usually have slightly milder winters . 
  so weird seeing ours being higher than central europe . 
  i guess we always go there in the summer when it 's warmer than here . 
  same here . 
  any bit of sun we get it 's straight to a beer garden to get shit faced . 
  also , more women go to further education and more men have alcohol , drug and mental health problems . 
  so we just ignore the impending issues ? 
   the same deadlock would still exist . 
  this is only true if the netherlands treats the situations with similar incompetence as the french governement . 
  if you think ireland lost out on this deal you are wrong .
