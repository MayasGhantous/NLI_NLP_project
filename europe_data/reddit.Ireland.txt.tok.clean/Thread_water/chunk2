   the survey does n't actually ask anything about ** suicide ** bombings . 
  `` can ** suicide ** bombing of ** civilian ** targets to defend islam be justified ? '', 
  often/sometimes : france 16 % , uk 15 % , nigeria 46 % agree . 
  ( even higher percentage with younger muslims ) did you read the source ? 
  http://www.pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf#page=60 they probably do n't consider, 
   and you ca n't believe at least 30 % of europeans would be against bombing russia if they invaded germany and killed civilians ? 
  do i think people would support targeting russian civilians ? 
  no i do n't . 
  speak for yourself bud , i would n't support suicide bombings against civilians in that case . 
  [ another ] ( http://c1.thejournal.ie/media/2014/02/weather-28-630x472.jpg ), 
   how the hell else do you propose to give a country money if not as loans ? 
  if they ca n't pay back the loans then you should n't load to them . 
  it 's quite simple actually . 
  if then people are starving or the euro is failing and you do n't want that to happen you could consider donating money to help . 
  ( clearly you do n't have to but people donate money to the poor all the time , and if it also helped the euro from failing it 's an added reason ) . 
   so by lending a country money when nobody else does you starve it ? 
  :d when you lend more than a country can possibly pay back ( for your own gain ) , and then demand taxes which people ca n't pay , do you not think that 's wrong ? 
  i do n't know about ` starving ' them , but it certainly does n't seem right on the greek people . 
  ( despite the overspending and shit that they did ) . 
  wonder will the northern ireland border have to change ? 
  anyone know ? 
  at the moment there 's no border , i 'd imagine it would stay that way . 
  by accepting refugees who arrive dangerously you are ensuring that refugees continue these dangerous journeys . 
  more kids will die . 
  if you want to help these people , legit methods of coming to our countries should be set up and people using illegal methods should not be allowed in . 
  why are we rewarding dangerous illegal activities ? 
  pretty much the same as it is today , shit changes slowly . 
  it surprised me but i ca n't speak of its accuracy , i really do n't know . 
  although i will say that our safety index does n't seem right , i would have though ireland a very safe country . 
   why do you guys have so much crime ? 
  the normal reasons , poor people , youth unemployment , drugs ( dealing ) , alcohol problems and a sort of ` fuck the system ' attitude where scamming any sort of unpersonalised system or organisation ( tax , insurance ... ) is not viewed as being morally wrong . 
  ( unless of course it 's someone richer than you doing it eg bankers or politicians but they do it too , and often do n't get imprisoned like they would in the u.s. ), 
  this is where our windy weather pays off lads :p, 
  wish we did n't have so much crime :( just behind russia . 
  i read somewhere that even the ` recycled ' e-waste is mostly burned after the valuable metals have been extracted . 
  ( in china or somewhere ) . 
   the country is also anticipating a total of as many as 800,000 applications this year , anyone else think that number is just crazy high ? 
  how anyone thinks they have the right to ` demand ' another country take in more migrants is beyond my understanding . 
  now imagine there was a huge leak of information from the nsa . 
  the repercussions would be massive . 
  i 've never met a polish person here in ireland who was n't awesome . 
  very friendly and hard working . 
  i would of thought that school bullying was fairly similar throughout the world . 
  it 's quite shocking that 1 in 14 say they are unhappy with life as a whole . 
  i could n't imagine me or any of my friends every saying that when we were that age . 
  we all would have said we hate school though . 
  and i also think we would have scored low with self-confidence but i do n't necessarily think that 's a bad thing . 
  although when you 're that young you might just answer yes to being unhappy with life in general if you 've just had a bad day . 
  i do think this argument is fairly shit but it 's often said here in ireland that emmigration damages ireland for this reason . 
  people call it the ` brain drain ' . 
  and it does actually make sense . 
  well ireland has debt at about the same as our gdp . 
  so we clearly must have a net income from other countries for a while no ? 
  a trade surplus means they are exporting more than they import yes ? 
  if so i ca n't understand how having a positive one is a bad thing ? 
  every country does but people have different preferences . 
  they were the first country to recognise an independent ireland . 
  they might be quite crazy but not religiously crazy  i love watching videos of russians climbing things . 
  some good puns can come from russian ( rushin ) . 
  their space race with the u.s. lead to us reaching space then the moon and developing new technologies while they 're at it . 
   if you live in a city is it normal to see someone talking into their phone and the whole bus/subway car can hear it small conversations like where are you , who are you with , what did you do today , are all quite common ( although rarely with bluetooth headset ) . 
  long conversations like `` long discussions , idle chitchat and even personal arguments with a spouse '' rarely happen and voices would be kept low on a bus/train . 
  probably happens in peoples cars often enough though . 
  in the south of france everyone goes for a sleep during the day . 
  that 's awesome !, 
  i 'd love to take a nap after lunch during work . 
  well during the summer , days are too short here to be doing that in the winter . 
  well there 's borders for scotland and wales as well so it 's somewhat understandable . 
  i do n't know much about it tbh . 
  i do know that when obama was going for president i heard/read a lot about him and genuinely thought he was majorly going to change the direction of the u.s. 
  but this did not happen . 
  some people say this is because the president does n't have enough power to change things . 
  i do n't know though . 
  i lost a lot of respect for him soon after the election . 
  also i hate politicians speeches or interviews . 
  they always seem so fake . 
  but u.s. presidents are the worst . 
  tehy 're just so prepared , purposefully made and probably been examined by many ` experts ' . 
  it means i never really know what the person is like . 
  i often feel like comedians come across as smarter people than politicians . 
  at least they actually say things with purpose . 
   in may 2007 , an inmate named john daly , who was serving 9 years for armed robbery , called the rt\u00c9 radio show liveline from inside the prison . 
  [ 8 ] he called in to defend himself against sunday world crime journalist paul williams who was speaking on the radio show at the time . 
  daly was on air for a few minutes before prison guards took the phone from him and ended the conversation . 
  [ citation needed ] this phone call resulted in a major clampdown in all irish prisons and over 1,300 pieces of contraband being confiscated . 
  items confiscated in the cell-by-cell searches included numerous mobile phones , plasma televisions and even a budgie which was smuggled into the prison by a visitor who hid the bird internally in her vagina . 
  [ 9 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portlaoise_prison if they had plasma tvs , phones and pets i doubt the conditions are nearly as bad as some u.s. prisons . 
  i do n't know though .

  well it could just be that there are a lot more non-muslim criminals in the u.k. than in france , rather than there being a lot more non-criminal muslims in france . 
  i have n't a clue though . 
  same in ireland , comes from radio static . 
  which i believe comes from white noise . 
  cool did n't know this .
