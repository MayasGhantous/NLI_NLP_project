  with improvements in technology i fully expect our sustainable limit to rise , as it has been for 1,000 s of years . 
  currently we are having a massive impact on our environment , most scientific evidence shows that within the next century our environment could change quite rapidly very possibly causing water and food scarcities in places . 
  in order to reduce our impact we either have to reduce our consumption or reduce our population . 
   increasing does n't mean chaos either . 
  no of course not . 
  just looking the current global or even within-eu numbers you will see that the current population is not sustainable in the long run . 
  therefore it makes sense that ** currently ** we should be happy maintaining or reducing our population . 
  of course we should not do this indefinitely . 
  i 'm no expert on sweden 's population but it 's currently rising , probably due to immigration . 
  so if immigration ceases then maybe sweden might have economic problems due to an aging population but certainly wo n't have worries of ` dying out ' . 
  shrinking does n't mean dying . 
  as i 've said even if we shrunk so much that we only had 1 % of the population we currently have we would not be close to dying out . 
  and this is completely unlikely to happen . 
  anyways in that link it shows that most of europe is currently increasing ( annual growth of .22 % ) sweden is at 0.57 % and ireland is at 1.2 % . 
  so we are still increasing . 
  population is currently rising . 
  population is currently much higher than it 's ever been . 
  the danger of us dying out due to low birth rates is laughably unlikely at the moment . 
  even if 99 % of us stopped having kids , those 1 % would reproduce passing on their fertile genes , meaning there would still be at least 10 million horny fuckers :p, 
  i 'm not addressing any problem and would never suggest imposing rules to enforce a low birth rate . 
  i 'm simply saying that a low birth rate is not a bad thing , lets hope other places such as africa and asia follow suit . 
   unless you of course advocate that europeans should vanish so that africans can grow . 
  africa is the country that needs to hear this most . 
  the only realistic way of tackling our unsustainable consumption is by tackling it from multiple angles . 
  increase efficiency , decrease consumption per person and decrease or maintain the population . 
  currently for every increase in efficiency we either increase the population or increase the consumption per person . 
  in the long run it 's likely technology will allow us to be able to sustain much larger populations . 
  with current technologies and consumption we are not at a sustainable rate . 
  we can gamble on technologies being developed in time or we can maintain or lower our current population . 
  if we want to live in a sustainable world we have to stop growing our population at some stage . 
   it is that the war is decided and then its just a matter of bringing the population onboard ( as much as one can ) through various means and measures . 
  yes i agree with this . 
  but in this case it seems that they did not manage to get the population on board . 
  ( although these numbers have been disputed in other comments ) in the us , for example , i 'd imagine at least close to 50 % of the population supported going to war , i 'd imagine larger that that . 
  yeah that 's more like i would have expected . 
  i 'm amazed that 90 % of the uk were against it . 
  that 's such a large majority of people , i 'm amazed the government could act against such a large proportion of the population . 
   `` but given that it is a decision we 'll try to make the best we can , which includes making sure that britain has access to the single market . 
  that 's in ireland 's best interests . '', 
  i think this is the most important thing . 
  if there were charges put on sales between ireland and the uk we would be hit quite hard , especially in agriculture . 
  ( i think 50 % of our ag . 
  exports go to the uk . ), 
  the border is another big issue but i do n't think britain 's lower corp. tax rate will have a massive effect as the uk also lost an advantage of being part of the eu . 
  i 'd imagine this improve irelands chances at attracting multi-nationals . 
   the police have been examining seven suspects , six of them foreigners , whose ages range from under 18 to 35 , inspector nystrom said ; no arrests have been made . 
  from this attack , from the article . 
  maybe it 's time to realise that mentioning the background of the perpetrators is a perfectly reasonable thing to do . 
  if idiots misinterpret it and think that all immigrants must be this way then this is not the fault of the ny times . 
  they are reporting what happened . 
  we got a lot out of the eu . 
  one of the biggest success stories of the eu until the recession . 
  but we 're back on track at the moment , 
   because making referendums when things are that tied is just fucking useless making referendums when things are not tied is useless . 
  the only time to have a referendum is when it 's quite close so we need one to determine what the majority thinks . 
  if it 's not tied then it 's usually quite obvious what the majority thinks and the government would be wasting time having a referendum . 
  ok that 's true alright . 
  i still disagree with the eu 's free movement stipulation , but i can see how it makes sense for them to ask for more than just an exchange of markets . 
  the eu gets access to the swiss markets whilst switzerland gets access to the eu market . 
  that 's a fair exchange . 
  eu citizens get to live and work in switzerland whilst swiss citizens and live and work anywhere in the eu . 
  that 's a fair exchange . 
  yeah you 're right . 
   a single market is a type of trade bloc in which most trade barriers have been removed ( for goods ) with some common policies on product regulation , and ** freedom of movement of the factors of production ( capital and labour ) ** and of enterprise and services . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_market so why not just a free trade agreement with everything that a single market has besides free movement of labour ? 
  you mean they want a better deal ? 
  i mean both of those deals would be fair on their own . 
  from a fairness point of view it seems that the eu is being a bully . 
  i think that he/she expects the eu to grant this concession to any state that wants it , and not solely switzerland . 
  and if this is what switzerland wants then of course they are going to try and negotiate a deal . 
  even if it is quite unlikely . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but it seems to me that there are two separate deals here . 
  switzerland gets full access to the eu market , the eu gets full access to the swiss market . 
  is one deal . 
  then a separate deal would be to allow citizens of switzerland live and work in countries in the eu , allow citizens of the eu to work and live in switzerland . 
  why do they both have to be tied together ? 
  why should n't the eu respect switzerland 's decision to limit free movement ? 
  i seriously do n't understand it . 
   the thing is the usa and the eu are , politically , completely different societies . 
  this is one reason why britain voted to leave . 
  they feel they are politically , completely different societies . 
   people do n't want honesty . 
  some people do . 
  but yeah it 's often political suicide to speak your mind . 
  it should n't be though . 
  yeah i think you 're right . 
  there 's a difference between insult and offence though . 
  an insult is done with the main purpose to piss off the other person . 
  but saying something you believe to be true and you believe you should say is the right choice , even if it causes offence or pisses people off . 
  i would love to see a united ireland also . 
  only if the majority in northern ireland want it though . 
  i do not begrudge the current uk government/people for the six counties . 
  if you think the irish should be grateful for british occupation your thoughts on history are quite skewed . 
  i believe the uk took a step in the wrong direction with brexit but all this fear mongering bullshit is not helping . 
   everyone remembers the empire and the atrocities they commited . 
  do we also remember all the progress we 've made ? 
  how the uk has been a friend to ireland and europe , how they helped us during the worst of our recession ? 
  or how the irish-english relationship is better than it 's ever been ? 
  people , especially british people , should be wary of direction the uk is taking , but all of this panic is unjustified . 
  i presume you 're not advocating lies , in which case you must advocating holding back thoughts on matters ?
