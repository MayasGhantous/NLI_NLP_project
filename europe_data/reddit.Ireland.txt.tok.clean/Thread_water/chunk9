  they ** should ** have every right to ban people covering their faces from entering . 
  this is nothing to do with banning it from public . 
   at no point should any citizen of a free , democracy be feeling ` uneasy ' in there own neighbourhood or city , government has every right to legislate it . 
  i feel uneasy when i see young lads wearing tracksuits , should we ban them also ? 
  shoelaces can be used to kill , they also pose a security threat . 
  the question is how much do we want to government to intrude on our lives in the name of security . 
  in my opinion dictating what people wear is gone way too far . 
  `` i do n't like people wearing something on their face so no one can do it '' `` i do n't like women showing their face so no one can do it '' . 
  when will people learn they can dislike something without getting the government to ban it . 
  we live in the most coddled times where just because someone feels uncomfortable with veils no one can wear them . 
  yes they certainly ** should ** . 
  but either way just because a government continues to have relations and trade with saudi arabia does n't mean they are pro-saudi arabia . 
   why is every western government so pro-saudi arabia ? 
  i was talking about the average person rather than the government 's . 
  it often makes sense for a government to keep close ties with countries like saudi arabia in order to avoid war and for economic reasons ( oil ! ), 
  but i think they should be way less pro-saudi arabia , and so do many people i know . 
  but almost everyone is concerned about saudi arabia , most people are concerned about many of the things both the u.s. and china governments do . 
  who are all these people who have a problem with israel but consider china and saudi arabia to be nice governments ? 
  oh yeah sorry you 're correct , i misunderstood and thought you were criticising the title . 
  the 179 % figure was crime over all classes ( i believe ) . 
   crimes committed by foreigners has increased significantly . 
  - numerically , 206 cases and the percentage of growth is 179 per cent . 
  growth in all classes of crime statistics , the highest numbers of crimes against property , then later on in the article  sexual offenses were made early in the year 56 . 
  the number is six more than in the corresponding period last year . 
  all from google translate . 
  people are mostly uninformed and only know trump is bad because of all the hype and as it 's kind of obvious . 
  tbh i only think badly on clinton because of the stuff i 've read on reddit . 
   i 'd make my reactions * proportional * to the number of dancers if i were you . 
  ftfy, 
  anyone dancing over the killing of my friends , family or fellow country men will most certainly be confronted and if it 's friends or family that have been killed that confrontation may be violent . 
  emotionally i 'd feel justified at the time . 
  not that it 's right . 
  so open to abuse from 4chan !, 
  i would have though japan to be higher . 
  and greece to be lower tbh . 
   how does that explain political correctness disappearing when discussing gypsies ? 
  if you believe political correctness spawned from fear of repercussions then this perfectly explains it . 
  are n't wooden frame houses warmer though ? 
   largely because of long commutes and oversized houses . 
  i understand how important reducing how much carbon we are releasing but personally i like big houses and living in the country . 
  i do n't like the european style living-in-an-apartment-block setup . 
  i think people who do like living like this often dismiss , or do n't even consider , that other people do not . 
  how did you react ? 
  i 'm not trying to be ` hard ' but i seriously would have confronted anyone who cheered for a horrible event like that . 
  yeah actually it turns out it 's not the best data . 
  comments below . 
  a better measurement . 
  fair enough i honestly did n't read into it in detail , i also would have considered japan to be one of the safest until i read this . 
  there is also the [ global peace index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_peace_index ) which seems more genuine . 
  iceland are first , japan 8th and ireland 12th . 
  edit : look at the methodology section , takes loads of factors into consideration . 
  actually i believe a lot of european countries are the safest in the world , according to [ this ] ( http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/safest-countries-in-the-world.html ) . 
  japan is 22 on this list . 
  ireland is 4 , 
  oh yeah for sure . 
  it 's a seriously over-the-top sensationalist statement to make . 
  feeding off people 's fears in order to push his agenda . 
  it 's just trump supporters love to point out when people make false claims about trump , it fuels their fire . 
  so i 'm simply pointing out that trump is n't necessarily saying that europe is more dangerous than the us . 
   and added that he did not even think america was a safe place for americans . 
  i do n't think he 's trying to say it 's more unsafe than america . 
  could you possibly explain the reasoning ? 
  the translation is pretty poor . 
   i think with proper education and most of all respect , the problem will solve itself yes i completely agree with you . 
  proper education is key . 
  the problem with education today is that people are not honest with kids . 
  kids can handle a lot more than adults give them credit for . 
  they should be taught both the good and the bad about things in the world such as religion , racism , fear , hatred , love etc. 
  they should not be presented with an idealised view of the world to ` protect them ' . 
  or at least that 's my opinion on the matter , as it 's quite clear that current our education systems are n't currently operating sufficiently . 
  you 're correct , it very well might . 
  and we should try to avoid such a situation . 
  but i ca n't just not hate islam because by doing so some people will hate me for it . 
  that does n't change the reasons for my hatred . 
  if people knew what 's contained in the quran they would also probably hate islam . 
  you 're right , just feel this needs to be clarified . 
  hating muslims ! = hating islam . 
  you can hate islam without hating all muslims . 
  at home watching it and asking `` where are the sensible people ? '', 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/4bgzmi/both_ireland_and_northern_ireland_would_be/ ) is that article posted in / r/ireland a week ago . 
  look in the comments to see discussion on the matter . 
  ( clearly reddit does n't reflect the general population but still it shows some of the attitudes towards it ) . 
   same thing in the uk . 
  the law does n't get applied easily . 
  tell that to matthew p. doyle . 
  i really ca n't believe people think it 's alright to arrest someone for a tweet like that . 
  i mean if we arrested everyone who has made as stupid and hateful remark as that we 'd have to arrest half the country i 'd imagine . 
  i 'm not exactly sure what they qualify as a terrorist attack . 
  i looked at ireland in their [ database ] ( https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/results.aspx?chart=casualties&amp;casualties_type=&amp;casualties_max=&amp;country=96 ) and the attacks seem to spike up in 2012 , yet with no injuries or fatalities so i 'm not sure what to take from it . 
  edit : from a quick glance through the incidents it seems a lot are bombs being found but not detonated . 
  it often seems the people involved in these things were somewhat known by authorities beforehand and they could n't prove anything . 
  either there are loads of suspects like this , in which case it 's understandable but scary , or there 's only a few , in which case i do n't understand why they would n't keep an eye on them at least . 
   going buy this chart literally no one wants to live there . 
  probably not many from an eu country , this does n't mean there are n't plenty outside the eu who might want to live there . 
  although i 've no idea if there are . 
   at the meeting with the principal yesterday , parents were told that between 90 and 95 percent of the students at the school now are children of foreign origin . 
   our children have become a minority and the principal said that 's why it has become so messy as it is , says malin . 
  whites ca n't be a minority !, 
   minarets are allien to skylines of european cities . 
  what 's your point here ?
