  - if it 's the former , it shows that the japanese know their ww2 history very well , as most europeans rarely acknowledge that the germans and soviet 's were in fact allies ( jointly invaded poland etc. ) . 
  - if it 's the latter , it shows the opposite .

  well in 1963 the british empire was still [ putting millions of kenyans in camps ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/23/british-empire-crimes-ignore-atrocities ) which had slogans like `` labour and freedom '' outside them . 
   elkins reveals that the british detained not 80,000 kikuyu , as the official histories maintain , but almost the entire population of one and a half million people , in camps and fortified villages . 
  there , thousands were beaten to death or died from malnutrition , typhoid , tuberculosis and dysentery . 
  in some camps almost all the children died . 
   the inmates were used as slave labour . 
  above the gates were edifying slogans , such as `` labour and freedom '' and `` he who helps himself will also be helped '' . 
  loudspeakers broadcast the national anthem and patriotic exhortations . 
  people deemed to have disobeyed the rules were killed in front of the others .

   ### turkish pm calls for broader view of muslims  turkish prime minister ahmet davuto\u011flu has put forth a call to `` liberate all islamic lands under occupation , '' while also asking for a common and broader view of muslims in order to discuss the problems of the muslim world with maturity . 
   `` we need a common stance for the liberation of all the islamic lands that are under occupation , especially palestine , '' said davuto\u011flu april 14 , while delivering an opening speech at the 13th organization of islamic cooperation ( oic ) summit in istanbul . 
   the prime minister added the oic should improve efficiency in areas where muslim minorities have met difficulties and felt alone . 
   ** `` the most important indicator which would show the effectiveness of the oic is protecting muslim minorities and liberating occupied lands such as palestine , karabakh and crimea , '' ** davuto\u011flu said . 
   he added the common stance should be for occupied territories , where the islamic identity is under threat of being demolished . 
   davuto\u011flu also called for a common attitude against the troubles facing the muslim world . 
   `` despite differences of opinion , we need to maximize political relations and improve bilateral contacts in maturity so we can discuss all problems in the muslim world , '' he said . 
   turkey is currently hosting the oic summit under the theme `` unity and solidarity for justice and peace '' for the first time since the body 's inception in 1969 . 
  it will lead the bloc for the next two years . 
   davuto\u011flu also warned that some muslim countries were confronted with the problem of separatism . 
  `` we need to compose a principled attitude against the risk of dismemberment of some states , '' he said . 
   before the opening speech , davuto\u011flu held separate meetings with azerbaijani president ilham aliyev , palestinian president mahmoud abbas , lebanese prime minister tammam salam and pakistani president mamnoon hussain . 
   a total of 57 member states , which have a total of $ 10 trillion gdp , will participate in the ioc summit . 
  apart from the high-level security measures taken in istanbul for the summit , which started days prior to the launch of the event , some 5,000 more police officers are on duty . 
   whoa , stop reediting you response i have to start from scratch each time ;-) it 's because i 'm a shit writer :-(  definitely !!, 
  it 's much more simple . 
  if corruption would mean the ellectoral death of a party , politicians would fix the thing by themselves . 
  an ethically exigent society is all what 's needed . 
  on this , i 'll take your word for it . 
  i am subject to catalan propaganda . 
   the iranian funding is even more believable , hispantv thats nuts . 
   how the mainstream parties consider a good thing to have worked for saudi arabia a great point . 
   the guardian is part of a editorial group with el pa\u00eds first time i 've heard that . 
   putin founded directly the front national ah now , do n't underestimate the ex-vichy french , it was founded in 1972 . 
   i probably wo n't convince you , but ceps was doing a work for the chavez government and they were paid for it , all of this when podemos neither existed nor was there any talk about it being created , in that moment podemos leaders still supported iu well to be honest , at least the chavez one is believable , i 'm not so sure about their [ `` iranian '' funding ] ( http://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2016/01/14/podemos-leader-pablo-iglesias-was-paid-e93000-by-iranian-businessman/ ) . 
  but , i personally , would like to think these guys would have a better moral standing than to do deal with these regimes . 
  granted , no one knew how venezuela was going to end when ceps started working with them . 
   constitution fault . 
  that does n't make any sense . 
  you think the constitution should stay as it is ? 
  the judiciary needs reform , and [ the monarchy have shown themselves to be every bit as corrupt as the pp ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/spains-monarchy-banking-scandal-queen-letizia ) . 
  not to mention the `` anti-separatist '' elements of the constitution . 
  can those change without a new constitution ? 
  if you look at the catalan issues , there is no independent arbitrator in the system . 
   the allegations of illegal funding against podemos have been dismissed several times ( by the supreme court and the audiencia provincial de madrid ) . 
  really ? 
  [ because it 's still being reported as under investigation as of april 6th ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/06/podemos-spain-leaders-deny-funding-link-venezuela-chavez-government ) my may point in all this is that corruption is systemic , meaning a system which facilitates the creation of corruption . 
  unfortunately , i 've not seen anything to refute this . 
  the judiciary has proven itself as a tool for the pp before , so it would n't surprise me if it was n't true . 
  but the idea that the pp is ** the ** problem , i just do n't agree with . 
  additionally , i thought i was bringing more attention to psoe ( who will be in charge of any coalition ) rather than specifically picking on podemos . 
  but it seems like they have a lot of supporters on reddit . 
  the fact is , by your admission , that they 're not as corrupt as the main parties . 
  and yet despite that you find no reason to encourage others to vote for them when did i say that ? 
  my point is that it 's systemic , i.e. 
  beyond pp . 
  i myself have voted for ciu , and can say it was disappointing to see the recent scandals . 
  i would vote for en comu tomorrow if i could . 
   it would be trivial to refute , since they 're just that , allegations , opinions , etc. 
  how many actual confirmed cases do you happen to know for the smaller parties ? 
  podemos are being investigated by the prosecutor . 
  unfortunately , you will probably say that the prosecutor is a tool of the pp . 
  and there in lies the problem , there is no trust in the system as a whole . 
  for sure . 
  broadly though , i believe , the system creates the politicians . 
  podemos is the best thing that 's happened in spain for a long time . 
  i ca n't decide what i think of the foreign funding issue , as well as the [ authoritarian nature ( it seems ) of pablo iglesias ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/03/10/inenglish/1457599829_525273.html ) .
