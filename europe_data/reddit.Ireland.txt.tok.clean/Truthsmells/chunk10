  again , your point seems to be `` oh but that 's a bigger deal '' . 
  the commission found microsoft should be broken up , but in the end backed down . 
  my conjecture is the same thing will happen here ; especially given the us 's ability to start taxing transfer-pricing of european firms in the usa . 
  i 'm talking about the commission 's right to interfere . 
  there are either rules , or there is nothing . 
  regardless of size , or money , the competition commissioner can only go after uncompetitive positions that are held by corporations , or facilitated by governments . 
  so if something was deemed uncompetitive there are penalties , etc. 
  which is exactly why this is a good demonstration of what is wrong with eu . 
  personally , i believe if apple had been based in italy ( of if apple had been a european company , for example ) , with the same deal there would n't have been this level of investigation by the commission , and certainly not this level of punishment . 
  just as the the regional banks , steel mills , and car companies of italy are by anyone 's competition framework getting illegal subsidises to stay afloat from the italian state , yet are not investigated/punished to the same degree . 
  for me , this has much more to do with state 's ( i.e. 
  ireland 's ) rights than anything to do with apple , per se . 
  the commission has retroactively gone back and undermined the irish state . 
  it has then ignored the irish state in the procedures , and also ignores that ireland does not want the tax revenue . 
  is it about scale , or about the rules ? 
  the commission is supposedly trying to `` level '' the playing field for competitors . 
  same as the silly ideal of breaking up microsoft . 
  apple 's situation is about apple having an unfair advantage over its competitors , based on a supposedly beneficial tax agreement their competitiors could not have . 
  it is n't about tax , or the lack of it - verstager 's position is it is unfair to competition . 
  she had no other remit by which to `` investigate '' this . 
  if you think the apple tax issue is small , listen to what the us is threatening regarding retaliation . 
  seems a lot of bother for 13 billion that the `` beneficiary '' does n't want . 
   danish thatcher backed by eu commission led by tax scumbag no. 1 : juncker . 
  hopefully , it will go the same way as the delors commission once a true investigation of luxembourg happens . 
  the eu commission seems very selective on when it enforces it 's rulings . 
  italy , france and spain have barely hit there budget targets in a decade , yet no penalties . 
  not sure why the big push to force apple to pay ireland tax , that ireland does n't want . 
  illegal state subsidies in local banking , defence , and agriculture industries go un-investigated , why ? 
  the idea that us businesses are inherently more evil than european is farcical . 
  this is the eu commission going after a foreign corporation in a small country , that 's it . 
  there is no nobility in it . 
   eu parliament really ? 
  they are nearly up to us levels of lobbying . 
  i 'm sure something will work out . 
   single member state ( with voting rights ) that can block all further treaties . 
   apple competitors ( which are some of the largest corporations on earth ) apple has no competitors in the eu . 
  the eu is terrible at producing consumer electronics . 
   the usa you mean the country solely responsible for protecting the visegrad countries ? 
  the one providing all the security expansion and training ? 
  yeah i 'm sure poland ( for example ) would n't listen to anything the us has to say . 
  * oh yeah ... * danish thatcher vs. 
  member state ( with voting rights ) , the usa , and one of the largest corporations on earth . 
  i 'm sure she 'll throttle us like monti did before . 
  the way things are going juncker wo n't last , and thus his commission will fall . 
  juncker was prime minister and finance minister of luxembourg and personally signed some of the worst `` sweetheart '' tax deals . 
  not sure how she keeps `` digging '' without harming the commission president , and thus herself . 
  * especially * how she is so far only going after us multinationals . 
  surely its about time she looks at defence manufacturing subsidies ? 
  yeah , yeah ... 
  i remember monti saying the same thing when he wanted to break up microsoft . 
  this is a long way from being done . 
  ` suppose you [ * were * ] ( http://mashable.com/2016/08/30/kalgoorlie-protests-australia/#qmjcu7v8wzqw ) busy . 
  go abuse some refugees . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** * you jelly * . 
  the brits are great with this . 
  when our economy started to improve it was because of all those `` eu subsidies '' , now its because we are doing `` beggar thy neighbour '' tactics . 
  pesky paddys always up to no good , taking what should rightfully be the noble saxon 's , * is that your point here ? 
  * it was the british who invented this whole price-transfer system with the bvi , jersey , and the caymans etc. 
  you do n't like it now we are playing the game better than you ? 
  what do you think the uk has been doing with the city all this time ? 
  when france said it would raise taxes on french bankers the british `` rolled out the red carpet '' for french bankers , making any tax rises by hollande impossible . 
   in other words : countries ** whose populations actually innovate ** , generate new inventions , make new discoveries , and take risks in starting new business ventures are effectively punished by countries like ireland and luxembourg that leach successful businesses away with sweetheart tax deals . 
  those pesky paddys at it * again * . 
  i love that you let your guard down and pointed to `` populations '' . 
  pray tell what innovation britain has provided us , that is n't a hoover ? 
  all of the big british businesses began with your empire , and your theft or through what should be considered illegal subsidies to the defence industry . 
  name an `` innovation '' developed by the industrious british population which is n't a tax loop-hole , or a weapon which has been heavily subsidised . 
  battered-mars bar is scottish , so i do n't think it counts anymore . 
  i 'm genuinely curious of the goods that you chose to abstain from . 
  why do n't you tell us what they were , and give a russian equivalent ? 
  i 'm going to russia in a month , and would love to buy these cheaper , equal quality russian goods you speak of .

   if the uk and france still controlled the region i can bet my life that we would not have seen 1/100th of the issues in the past half century mate , they did n't just leave you know ? 
  they were kicked out for a reason . 
  you could say the exact same thing about the ottomans . 
   if the uk and france still controlled the region i can bet my life that we would not have seen 1/100th of the issues in the past half century there was violence before , and most of the current violence is a hangover from the british/french created states ( lebanon , syria , iraq ) . 
  the factions you see , especially in syria , are a product of the divide in rule policies of the french . 
  they made the alawites the `` tutsis '' , and the sunni the `` hutu '' . 
  the alawites had no serious power until the french took over in syria . 
   the imperialism from usa/uk has to stop and the french . 
  getting rid of gaddafi has been an absolute disaster , in this respect . ~ ~ hollande ~ ~ sarkozy played a critical role in that fiasco .
