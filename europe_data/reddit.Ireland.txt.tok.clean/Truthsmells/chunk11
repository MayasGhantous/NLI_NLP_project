  interesting map though . 
  but surely it is only `` us-based '' because erdogan 's been having a go at them for about 10 years ? 
  it is mainly subscribed to by turkish-speaking people ( turkey , azerbaijan etc. 
  ) , with nearly it 's entire membership in the region as well . 
  how did gulen recruit these `` cult members '' ? 
   most of americans still propably visit poland because of schindler 's list . 
  ah do n't say that , mate . 
  i 'd say a lot go because of `` the pianist '' as well . 
  gives a good overall cheerful vibe . 
  i do n't think many people in europe are concerned what 's happening to the gulen organization , per se . 
  it is what erdogen is doing to turkey that concerns us : - turkey has more journalists in jail than china , this was the case pre - coup attempt . 
  this will only get worse not better . 
  we had been hoping the turkish state was more like us , less like china/russia 's state . 
  - turkey is an important nato member which just had its general staff purged , rightly or wrongly . 
  is erdogen going to replace them with incompetent lackeys , weakening the alliance and endangering us ? 
  - erdogen has consistently sought to monopolize power , and this just the latest step of the `` auto-golpe '' . 
  even his own prime minister resigned because erdogen was seeking to undermine him pre-coup . 
  now it appears he will undermine what 's left of the military , education and judiciary . 
  - erdogen 's family have seemingly gained massive wealth , all whilst having no known talents in innovation , which makes us think he is massively corrupt . 
  he built a palace for himself , and his son is wanted for questioning in italy for illegal activity . 
  this also makes us think he can not be trusted . 
  if you are being told that people in europe are worried because of what has happened to the gulen organization , we are not . 
  we are worried about how one , arguably corrupt man , is seizing control of one of the most important nato members , and who will irreparably damage eu - turkey relations , destroying the western hope of progressive muslim democracy 's . 
  * edit : typed on my phone , autocorrect . 
  most of us think gulen is just erdogen without power . 
  cult is a relative word , friend , and definitely one than can be used for a myriad of organized relgions . 
  erdogen moved against the kemalists long ago , using suspected coup attempts ( sledgehammer ) as the pretext for purges ; y' know , pretty much what he 's doing right now against the gulenists ( however , the most recent seems to have been real , whilst i believe he had prior knowledge ) . 
  it 's crazy to me that erdogen has been able to go back and forth on the spectrum . 
  from gulen , the grey wolves and now the remnant kemalists , he 's played them all like a fiddle . 
  using and disposing of them as necessary . 
  the only upside is with a demagogue you usually just have to bribe him to keep him on side , whereas before we were worried erdogen would go full sharia . 
  now he is friends with putin again , he 'll probably come to an understanding on syria and bashar , helping to put down the kurds in rojava , and be all the more popular in turkey for it . 
  buddy , erdogen does not represent kemailism . 
  kemal : `` hijabs at uni , not even once '' . 
  * why do you think we want it ? 
   ` most of them are losers , ' says turkey 's justice minister to be fair , most of reddit * are * losers . 
  man , i 'd be scared shitless they would arrest me too . 
  bathe my house in turkish flags , i would . 
  olympics for sam !, 
  well if things are progressing like they should , he should invade syria any time now . 
  especially how he made sure to make friends again with russia and israel just before the coup . 
  ahhhhhh yes , the `` marxist genocide '' ? 
  `` bloody immigrants '', 
  but ... / r/europe * hates * sweden . 
  it 's like it does n't represent the majority of public opinion or something . 
  it has not been repealed . 
  i 'm surprised by the amount of defensive falangebots on reddit . 
  it is not `` trash talking '' to shows news articles demonstrating the use and abuse of this law . 
   repealed that 's strange [ as the socialists only called for it to be repealed * on november 30th * . 
  ] ( http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/11/30/inenglish/1480497448_546269.html ) and fyi , they are n't the government . 
  as the article states :  socialist-sponsored motion * has no binding power * thus , the law is still in place . 
  and just so you know , if journalists are still getting financially penalised for it , it has n't been `` repealed '' . 
  that means what would be considered a part of normal free speech in `` the west '' is illegal . 
  hence , the penalty . 
  you still even treat [ burning pictures of the king as a crime . ] ( http://www.ara.cat/politica/laudiencia-nacional-joan-carles-passat_0_1222677898.html ) . 
  it 's good to have that in common with thailand 's junta . 
  what i love is , you think because something is/may be `` repealed '' makes up for how horrendous the law is/was in the first place . 
  that it should n't be talked about any more , because rajoyito may be pressured to * amend * it ? 
  did val virkennes move back to bergen ? 
  between this , and the paedophile scandal , i do n't think it 's been this nuts since the church burnings . 
  what part ?

  i 'm not intending to propagate the politics of catalan separatists , but this argument that 100s of years ago , that , `` x was done to benefit catalunya , thus they owe spain '' is not productive . 
  that 's 3 ( + ) generations ago . 
  it also ignores the fact that catalunya ( and madrid ) have been vast net-payers to the other regions of spain . 
  where does all the money to keep andalucia going come from again ? 
  this argument works both ways . 
   laws like this so spain followed protectionism , like many countries the world over at different points of development . 
  again , those products did not need to originate in catalonia , but for some reason did . 
  i have , and still would argue , catalunya 's development was because of catalonia 's privileged geographic position towards france during the 1800s , it 's access to the med and atlantic . 
   once again here for foreigners : why are n't catalan nationalist movements or they 're very minority in catalan speaking regions like val\u00e8ncia or balearic islands ? 
  are n't they catalans ? 
  because they 're ( relatively ) poor regions . 
  it 's all about money . 
  so all the [ myriad of `` commy parties '' ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/candidatura_de_unidad_popular ) in catalunya want independence purely to get a tax break ? 
  there are [ many parties in catalunya who * do * want all the `` catalan countries '' ] ( http://arran.cat/qui-som/assemblees/ ) under one unit , but the major parties argue it would be undemocratic to force areas to join which now have a majority culturally identifying with a different group ( spain , france , or even valencians who want their own independence ) . 
  i think they are being pragmaticly realistic . 
  ask yourself this question : if catalunya is * still * the richest , best performing community , why does n't madrid listen to some of their criticism and change policy accordingly ? 
  instead they just go on about `` ungrateful , selfish catalans '' . 
  it would be like ireland only listening to galway for economic guidance ( shit example ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://fortune.com/2015/01/30/spain-catalonia-independence-taxes-economy/ ) is a great article talking about the spanish central governments malfeasence . 
  a summary :  * according to a recent study co-authored by l\u00f3pez , in 2012 catalonia collected 118.6 % of the national average of taxes per capita , putting it in third out of 15 regions . 
  but after redistribution , its resources fell to 99.5 % , putting it in 11th place . 
  at the other extreme , the region of extremadura collected 76.6 % of the average in taxes , putting it in 14th place , but after redistribution it ended up with 111.8 % , putting it in third . 
  *  * more galling to many in catalonia is that the regions of pa\u00eds vasco ( basque country ) and navarra have a special deal that lets them keep almost all of their tax receipts instead of forwarding them to the central government . 
  according to l\u00f3pez , that leaves them with 40 % to 60 % more in resources per capita * but ultimately , you are right . 
  if there was a proper fiscal contract with the central government , i believe the majority of catalans would * not * vote for independence . 
  [ same as in spain , so .

  buddy , i think you 've drunk the anti-historical falange kool-aid . 
   the castillians invested all their wealth in catalonia 's textile industry can you point to one source for this ? 
  especially , given that most of the industrial development in catalunya happened from the 1800s on , when castille slipped into poverty after the growing loss of the empire , and failure to modernise . 
  not to mention cities such as barcelona and the surrounding regions have been wealthy since roman times . 
   basically all of spain had their money invested in a single region , for the most part . 
  really , can you explain the wealth and strength of the basque country then ? 
  also from castille 's non-exist capital post-french invasion ? 
   when we lost cuba we actually had an economic boom because the catalan bourgeoisie came back and we boomed like hell - they could n't have been in the colonies in the first place if the rulers did n't want to . 
  so catalans returned to catalonia , and built it up . 
   catalonia is today what it is thanks to spain and spain is today what it is thanks , in part , to catalonia . 
  it 's been a mutual benefit .
