  to summize your argument : `` those filthy catalans have our industry on their land '' ? 
  that 's quite churlish , mate . 
  no need to get jelly . 
  guess what ? 
  geography matters . 
  catalonia borders france , and has access to the med and close access to the atlantic . 
  it 's proximity to france , during their development played a big part , but so did the the huge capital investment from abroad , especially the germans in places such as terrassa . 
  not to mention catalonia 's own very successful industrialists . 
  in fact , catalonia grew * in spite * of terrible internal demand , by focusing on exports , something only they , and the basques , seem to realise the importance of . 
  [ us too :-) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_armada_in_ireland ), 
   ( sorry for snooping ) violated . 
   `` i have black friends ! '', 
  i did n't say they were my mates . 
  they are too busy doing math . 
   but if you look further , you 'll find a moustachioed non-english speaking poorly paid worker , who sends his grandson to a polish weekend school , buys imported polish wares in a polish grocery store , supports pis and would vote if he had the time to go to the embassy , and hates muslims , gypsies ( of any kind ) and probably also blacks . 
  and calls most of the irish lazy fatties . 
  and i have not made that person up . 
  he , and many similar to him , are a huge chunk of that 150000 . 
  to be fair then , mate , why should n't we want them to fuck off ? 
  i do n't think polish people would be so keen on there being 3.5 % of the population being recent immigrants ( last 15-20 years ) in poland , demand things , and disliking their adopted country to such an extent . 
  whilst at the same time , bringing , quite frankly , [ alien , racist , and neonazi groups to the country ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/protest-mounted-in-dublin-against-polish-far-right-event-1.2171704 )  lazy irish fatties perhaps this is why ireland does n't have foreign voting , so that only those living in the country can decide it 's fate . 
  it 's all very well for the polish in ireland to vote pis , but it 's not them who have to pay the consequences . 
  it might also serve to create in their minds a false sense that they were going `` home '' eventually , whereas in reality , ireland is there home . 
   i wanted to see what people have to say about the state of the irish language ( because that was the thing i added to the discussion ) , you did it to shit-stir . 
   the anti-immigration rants i got in reply were just a cherry on top . 
  at no point did i make anti-immigrant remarks . 
  i just asked logical questions . 
  i ca n't speak for any other remarks you read . 
  i admire the polish people greatly , and they are probably the best immigrants ireland could hope for , given our shared national , religious , and political cleavages . 
  as you can imagine , i have a lot of work colleagues who are polish . 
  however , they are not the people who send their kids to all-polish community shops , and get their kids to swear allegiance to `` god and poland '' , even though they were born in ireland . 
  the people i am referring to are the minority , who just so happen to have quite a lot of sway with the pis , hence the minister 's statements . 
  i fully support polish being a choice for secondary school ( which it already is , it 's just not wide spread yet ) , alongside german , and french . 
  but i would prefer spanish , italian , japanese or mandarin being supported before polish because they are higher gdp export/larger population opportunities . 
  the argument here is there needs to be some prioritization of polish , because a lot of polish people immigrated to ireland . 
  just as per * your * comment . 
   i like how in your rant you could replace poles with muslims or mexicans and it would still make sense , but then you 'd get down voted for being racist . 
  whilst , i hope you are not conflating polish nationalism with religion , you are exactly right . 
  when muslims are seen not to integrate people go crazy . 
  but when `` fellow '' europeans do n't though , it 's fine . 
  i 'm just applying the standards of the sub equally to all people not willing/wanting to integrate . 
  people should be discouraged from living parallel lives in the country they are born in . 
   we entrust the state to take away children from abusive homes or lock down mentally ill people . 
  it is easy to forget that in these sort of discussions . 
  i think european states have broadly proven themselves trustworthy , just in case you think i 'm stating otherwise . 
  with regards to this specific issue ( `` fake news '' ) , i am making the `` slippery slope '' argument , however much of a cognitive bias that is . 
  i 'm basing that on the ever increasing internet surveillance and censorship laws that are happening in the uk as the model . 
  i 'm not sure we have as bad a problem with `` fake news '' , as say the usa . 
  but they also have government [ `` perception management '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perception_management ) , which is effectively the same thing . 
  my concern is , the same could/will happen in europe . 
  and that this legislation could be used as a type of enhanced libel law , or something to that effect . 
  in that , if you criticize a government 's policies , and ca n't prove it , you could be breaking the law . 
  and what was your implication of this fact ? 
  you decided to add demographics to the debate to legitimize this mentality . 
   i know smart and critical thinking people that believe fake news because they were never interested in pursuing it deeper . 
  sure , but people need to be interested . 
  that 's a cultural thing . 
  legislators should be more interested in encouraging participation in politics , rather than hoping they may pass laws and treaties without dissent . 
  the need for `` fake news '' legislation speaks to a larger disenchantment of their making . 
   people do n't have time for that . 
  they are busy working , raising kids and pursuing their hobbies . 
  sometimes just `` checking the sources '' is not enough if you have no competence in some area . 
  absolutely right . 
  perhaps , then , a more applicable legislation would be `` facebook must create a algorithm that shows both sides of the story '' , or `` no headlines ending with ? '', 
  that would n't stop articles , opinion and news creation . 
  but it would greatly hamper the effectiveness of clickbate , and at least increase awareness of diverse opinions . 
   you can apply this to any law . 
  to me it 's simple - you lie in media you get punished for spreading misinformation . 
  we should not be afraid of policing that . 
  in an ideal world you 're right . 
  but i do n't trust the state to use such laws fairly . 
  what about all those stories that started out as absolutely `` true '' , but ended up false ? 
  an extreme , simplistic case , would be blair 's `` evidence '' for the iraq war . 
  could the state have used laws to say it was `` true '' , because the state said so ? 
  it took a decade to get to the real `` truth '' , which is that it was a complete fabrication . 
  the dissident view is always seen as `` fake '' by the state . 
  i am speaking about a very narrow band of people . 
  the majority of poles in ireland do n't think like this minister , or his `` irish voters '' who have lobbied him to say this . 
  i took issue with the above posters ' logic that it was some sort of `` right '' , because they have 150,000 people in ireland . 
  personally , i think people should do their best to integrate wherever they move to . 
  i have the same contempt for irish people who fail to do the same . 
  and nothing i wrote above can be construed in any other way . 
  if you move to ireland , have your kids in ireland , but still want to fill your kids time with things like the `` polish scouts '' ( which in poland proper is the feeding ground for the [ `` militia movement '' ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/27/europe/poland-militias-russia-tension/ ) ) , `` polish weekend schools '' , etc. , then you 'd want to ask yourself `` what am i doing in ireland ? '', 
   while contributing to ours . 
  how does that work exactly ? 
  if i spend my time lobbying polish political parties ( prawo i sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 ) , encouraging my kids to join polish scouts ( instead of the irish one ) , and think the indigenous language in ireland is of lesser value than my own ? 
  enlighten me to the cultural contribution there . 
  creating laws on the accuracy of news is rife for abuse . 
  it would be better if we retaught people some form of rhetoric at schools . 
  if you are only getting your news from facebook , via websites you 've never heard of , it means your ecology of news is very small . 
  people need to be taught to think critically of all the information they consume ( knowing they need to compare it with other sources , etc. ), 
  and then they 'll be able to understand what 's `` fake '' . 
  all news at the moment is entertainment . 
  `` fake news '' is just the logical conclusion of that . 
   there are more polish native speakers than irish native speakers in ireland . 
  just sayin ' . 
  is that meant to be insulting ? 
  because you 're welcome on all the remittances . 
  i think we 've been more than accommodating , and received very little credit for it . 
  it boggles the mind why people who have moved their whole life over to ireland , had their kids in ireland , and want to supposedly stay in ireland , need polish in school as a right - vs. optional secondary school ( the current situation ) .
