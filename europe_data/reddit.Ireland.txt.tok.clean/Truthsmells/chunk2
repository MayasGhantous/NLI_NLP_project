  but there is * no question * they 've brought discussion about corruption to the fore . 
  and , i agree that psoe have done better , but they had the chance previously to publicise expenses , for example , and reneged on their promises . 
  we 'll have to see if the new leader is a person of his word . 
  pp is a horror story , there is no question about it . 
  whether it 's the hundreds of millions of corruption or crazy falangists , they just seem to be constantly a self-serving elite ( or caste ) , and they seem shocked when people want to call them out on it , or * worse still * investigate them for it . 
   all the articles you linked about podemos are wrong , they are just throwing mud to see if something sticks , can you show me a reputable news organisation that agrees with you ? 
  the guardian , the independent have reported the allegations , because they 've vetted them . 
  you do n't think it 's strange , * at all * , that this level of foreign financing helped prop up a political party ? 
  in france people lost their minds over funding from putin to the le pen 's through a similar foundation system . 
  this is no different . 
  there is a reason why catalunya 's en comu podem is continually moving away from podemos proper . 
  thanks , fixed . 
   it 's overwhelmingly one political party unfortunately , no .

  you do realise nearly every m&a deal , every underwriting policy , and nearly all large currency transfers globally go through london right ? 
  not to mention libor . 
  to stop it you would need to fundamentally change capitalism .

  these teachers took a poll ? 
  they went to their classes and asked '' * who here thinks these lads were heroes ? * '' . 
  i really doubt the veracity of this . 
  even if this was true , every year in my school we were asked how much we drank daily . 
  i of course put the maximum , because i was a little dickhead - probably not too unlike these kids ; did n't mean it was accurate . 
   estonia , latvia , bulgaria and romania have low corporate taxes too . 
  i think it 's a historic reliability issue . 
  no reason to be jelly , bro .

  income and vat tax are the main state revenue drivers in ireland , too . 
   the dhkp-c , whose turkish initials stand for the revolutionary people 's liberation party-front , is an outlawed ultra-left group listed as a terrorist organization by britain , the eu and the united states .

  [ it 's been argued , very controversially , the soviets hated russian culture ** the most ** . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/two_hundred_years_together ) the idea being that the soviet leadership was made up of the many disparate minorities of the russian empire ( georgians , armenians , jewish , belarus etc. 
  ) , who were oppressed to the extent they , with liberal russians , wanted to remake their nation ( s ) anew . 
  something great in being able to issue bonds for periods longer than your state has existed .

  [ my sweet old sixth . 
  * still * not sure if you are trolling or not , trying to link ireland to isis this weekend . 
  if not , i 'm sorry but you are mistaken . 
   the provos you mean the 1970s terror group of northern ireland ? 
  which has no relation whatsoever to your previous statement of 1920s ? 
  which operated using completely different tactics ? 
   again i am talking about the tactics and strategy used to win a war , not what ends that war is being fought for . 
  what war are isis , and these guys in belgium and paris trying to win ? 
  there is no amount of terror which would make us all become muslims - which i understand is their goal ( ? ) . 
  isis have an army , with tanks and actually control cities , and thousands of soldiers . 
  the ira of the 20s still needed to be handed control of the government by the british . 
  the pira , and their political party sinn fein still have power because it was given to them . 
  the tactics of the ira were/are to make ireland impossible for britain to rule it . 
  isis and whatever we want to call these guys in belgium are trying to ethnically cleanse whole swaves of the middle east , and actually do control cities . 
  completely different sort of warfare . 
  this is not a good comparison . 
  i would say you are trolling for a laugh with this :  irish republic ( of 1921 ) was practically a prototype of the caliphate in terms of the methods used . 
  there was no republic until 1949 , so i 'm not sure what you mean there . 
  the irb never used the tactics that isis use : - they never publicly beheaded people , or throw them off roof-tops for the laugh . 
  - the never forced all the british and protestants to leave ireland under the fear of death ? . 
  - they never kidnapped , raped , and indoctrinated children . 
  - they never encouraged children of irish immigrants to blow up citizens of their new country for the laugh . 
  edit : phone errors . 
  holy shit they are petty . 
  i like how all the other flags are on the ground equally , whereas the palestinian flag needs to be flying in the center , aloft .
