   the holiday , which celebrates the jewish people 's survival when the tyrant haman vowed to wipe them out good that things have gotten better for them , so . 
  currently , living in catalunya ; immediately grew beard . 
   it would n't be an end though . 
  would unionists stop fighting if britain ` let go ' of ireland ? 
  pira did n't ` let go ' of northern ireland , despite the people of northern ireland voting not to join northern ireland . 
  twice !, 
  i 'm not sure what vote ( s ) you mean . 
  overall , you are referring to the conflict being without end . 
  i am referring to demands by terror groups . 
  the northern irish terror groups demands could be met , theoretically . 
  the islamic ( ? ), 
  terror groups can not . 
   wait , only people from northern ireland carried out any sort of bombings during the troubles , ever ? 
  i think you 'd have your head quite deep in the sand to believe that there was no involvement in or from any people in the republic at all . 
  not state-sanctioned violence , of course . 
  also , the uk citizens bombing dublin were then either roi citizens - unionists in dublin ? 
  not ni citizens ? 
  not once ? 
  you see why this seems a stretch to me . 
  this is in no way comparable to sons of algerian immigrants to belgium , going to syria , and returning to the place they were born and raised and committing terrorism . 
  ireland was , unfortunately , part of the united kingdom for quiet some time . 
  irish citizens and unionists did commit terror within the united kingdom , and the republic of ireland . 
  the pira also bombed british installations on the european continent . 
  your original point is that these are somehow equivalents , this is clearly wrong . 
  some have even argued that the whole irish-british conflict should be seen more as a civil war . 
   well , northern ireland did n't really give in much to the republic of ireland in truth - but roi amended the particularly egregious articles 2 and 3 of their constitution to remove their claim over ni . 
  so an agreement can be reached which does n't give over control , and still holds the republic did give up article 2 , so as to have a direct say in the governance of northern ireland ( good friday agreement , anglo-irish treaty ) . 
  additionally , all pira prisoners were released from british jails . 
  both sides gave up something . 
  overall , please remember , that objectively , `` the troubles '' were simply a classic colonial war/insurrection , nothing more . 
  it was about colonists vs. an indigenous population ; about territory , ownership and elites . 
  the islamic ( ? ), 
  terror groups do n't have some sort of territorial demand we can give them . 
  they do not have a leadership council that can be negotiated with , like the irish groups . 
   1 ) to a unionist ulsterman , there was also no scope for negotiation . 
  hence the failure of sunningdale . 
  the irish want to rule our country !, 
  ( and laid a constitutional claim over it at the time , remember . ), 
  how do we negotiate with that ? 
  both conflicts remain extremely intractable , and we must understand that for both , we will likely never reach a solution that satisfies everyone . 
  sorry if my writing was n't clear , i 'm on a train . 
  my point on this one is there is potentially * `` an end '' * . 
  if the pira got a united ireland , it logically ( bear with me ) would be the end . 
  the unionist groups would have * `` an end '' * in that there is no united ireland . 
  the is no * `` end '' * to the islamic ( ? ), 
  terror group 's aim at a united global caliphate . 
   2 ) did irish people attack those they saw as oppressing them ? 
  even outside northern ireland ? 
  of course . 
  two assassinations of english mps during the troubles , and attempts on the lives of ted heath and margaret thatcher . 
  a horrific number of bomb attacks that hit innocent civilians , in both england and the republic of ireland . 
  might be a bit controversial , as i am irish , but all of those were citizens of northern ireland - which legally is part of the uk , so they were committing terrorism in their own country ( legally speaking ) . 
  i was not saying that their bombings were any `` cleaner '' , but i think comparing the unionist , and irish terror groups to islamic ( ? ), 
  terror groups is misleading . 
   3 ) the troubles lasted a long time , but still ` only ' 30 years . 
  not as long as the problems in the middle east , not quite long enough for that particular problem to take root in the same way . 
  perhaps if good friday had never happened , we would be seeing some of that now . 
  some would argue `` the troubles '' have been going on 800 years . 
  however , you may very well be right , but negotiating an `` end '' to islamic terror groups would require a post-ww2-like conference , involving all the world nearly to placate the islamic ( ? ), 
  terror groups . 
  it 's not realistic , and would involve us having to agree to having israel erased from the map , for example . 
  not really a peace worth having , in my opinion . 
  edit : * many many typos . 
  whilst i emphasize with the point you 're making , i would stress there is a couple of profound differences : 1 . 
  the pira had a finite ** aim ** : united ireland / / / / / unionists had a finite ** aim ** : no united ireland . 
  the current breed of islamic terror wants a global caliphate - * how do we negotiate with that ? 
  irish people around the world ( us , aus etc. . ) did not attack the countries they moved to . 
  the children of irish immigrants did not get bored , and go to northern ireland to learn terror and return to their new countries and commit terror . 
  i 'm not trying to lesson the victims of `` the troubles ' '' suffering . 
  however , whilst terrorism has been used by both irish/unionist and islamic terror groups , that is where the similarity ends ; especially when we talk about finding a solution . 
  ** edited : ** changed the word strategy * to aim * for clarity . 
   madrid believe it or not , al qaeda were never found to have directed that . 
  edit : ** [ from the guardian  ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/31/spain ) **  the bombings were carried out by a group of young men , mostly from north africa , who were , according to prosecutors , inspired by a tract on an al-qaida-affiliated website that called for attacks on spain . 
  the tract called for `` two or three attacks ... to exploit the coming general elections in spain in march 2004 '' , saying that they would ensure the `` victory of the socialist party and the withdrawal of spanish forces [ from iraq ] '' . 
  madrid was the beginning of the worrying trend : immigrants of north african origin instigating `` inspired '' attacks on europe . 
  bombing isis would have done nothing to stop those lads in paris and belgium . 
  they were/are from belgium and france . 
  unless ireland was to bomb molenbeek , not really sure how it would help . 
  how ludicrous .

   is n't the northern ireland conflict at least a little bit a religious conflict ? 
  it 's origins are colonist vs.
