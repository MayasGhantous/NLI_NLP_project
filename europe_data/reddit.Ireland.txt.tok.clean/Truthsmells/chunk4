  native . 
  coincidentally , they just happen to have separate religions . 
  fair enough , so . 
  i was under the impression that poles got irritated by that . 
  1916 centennial invite : ** denied **, 
  macedonia has it much much worse . 
  the greeks block their entry to nato and the eu over such a silly thing . 
  britain would n't keep ireland out of anything , and vis versa over it . 
  the irish state 's focus is purely on the economy when it comes to foreign relations . 
  this sort of thing would n't even be on the agenda bilaterally . 
  it does us no real harm , but causes butthurt as it 's usually the little islanders who like to wax lyrically about * `` muh empire '' * who bring it up . 
  it 's more like if all the former soviet union countries had to be perpetually referred to as the former soviet union . 
  it 's a bit insensitive , and demeaning , but they 'd get over it . 
  would you liked it if the germans called gdansk danzig , and said it was part of greater germania ? 
  islands of the north atlantic . 
  north atlantic islands . 
  fuck , even atlantic islands would be better , then we can whack in iceland and faroes . 
  but only one island in it is called britain , and the other ireland . 
  another example would be ukraine . 
  ukrainian 's do n't like their country being called the ukraine , because it implies ownership/control . 
  same with us . 
  islands of the north atlantic . 
  to be honest it 's only a geographic descriptive term . 
  to be honest mate , that chap just makes youtube videos . 
  does n't mean he 's correct . 
  yeah , yeah . 
  every and all trade treaties with the eu will have to ok 'd by us . 
   ## you people ### [ you people ???? 
  ] ( http://giphy.com/gifs/cfl8a1rb1przo/html5 ), 
  you 're just jelly , man . 
  absolutely . 
  it 's the law that 's the problem here . 
  but , in my opinion , the debate has been clouded by an adherence to an extreme free market philosophy ; which does not exist a world of nation-states . 
  ireland is not a tax haven , but that 's a different discussion . 
  the u.s. could however , simply do that for every country on earth as well , if that 's your logic - thus stopping all transfers , and world trade . 
  i do n't think it has to got that far . 
  unlike most countries , the u.s. has much more ability to put a halt on these types of transfers . 
  the corporations need the u.s. 
  it 's access to finance , investors and market . 
  they can complain about anti-business practices , but in the end of the day they can not do without the u.s. 
  legislation is the answer . 
  ** off the top of my biased , keynesian head : ** 1 . 
  u.s. congress passes a law that states to be listed on the dow , nasdaq or other exchanges in the u.s. the company must have it 's tax set-up/hq in the us . 
  then make huge incentives for pension funds to invest primarily in only u.s. equities/bonds . 
  - thus to play and benefit in the u.s. stock market you need to be registered in the u.s. pension funds will lobby to keep firms in the u.s. 2 . 
  a type of capital control , not allowing `` x '' amount assets to be transferred abroad in a single year if it is not for investment purposes by the company . 
  using the same principle that allows them to close the dow jones to stop a crash , as it it could be argued to damage the market . 
  - making it difficult for a company to simply sign a paper and transfer a headquarter . 
  this is literally adding bureaucracy to protect the u.s. economy . 
  u.s. creates capital requirements/treasury requirements for companies . 
  these can be either in cash or assets registered in the usa . 
  to play in the u.s. market , listed companies have to have x percent of assets in the usa.the either have to register the assets in the us , or have to have huge cash reserves in the us . 
  put a tax on pension funds investing in non-u.s. h.q. 
  companies . 
  create a disincentive , and encourage pension funds to lobby for assets to be moved to the u.s. 
  the roman empire is long gone , unfortunately . 
  i think the best example is greece . 
  they had an inflated economy on debt and were a major outlier in the region . 
  to their south , north africa , to their east turkey , to their west albania , and the north the balkans . 
  but somehow greece was supposed to develop much more than their regional neighbours ? 
  [ the new york times has a fantastic article about it . ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/opinion/25kaplan.html?_r=0 ) . 
  the cost of shipping has fallen with the oil price , and that is actually one of the major helps for the spanish economy , but where are they to ship to ? 
  all of it 's european competitors are in the centre of europe with much lower distribution costs . 
  they can not sell to mena or latam easily because those regions are highly protectionist , and their economies are floundering . 
  to illustrate my point , imagine you have a factory in southern spain of widgets . 
  the mena region is highly protectionist , and their economies floundering . 
  you have no option but to sell your products to northern europe . 
  you have to produce your widgets , get them on a truck , drive them all the way to germany , or whoever , to find a buyer . 
  problem is , german workers get paid nearly the same as yours , and they have a much shorter delivery time . 
  how do you compete ? 
  yes , but they report their income under the u.s. rules as well as their own stock markets . 
  the u.s. knows how much apple has in ireland . 
  if they want it , let them legislate for it . 
  the ifrs/gaap , and the tax rules within them , are the regulations and laws that the irish tax policy plays in . 
  we all agree to the same reporting rules . 
  ireland did n't just invent how foreign profits were declared . 
  so when the a us company `` inverts '' to ireland , it 's because it 's legal in the us . 
  if the us had capital controls , and the like , it would n't be possible to `` invert '' into an irish corporation . 
  exactly . 
  * tax haven * is term used for those criminally helping entities evade taxation . 
  ireland has treaties with everyone of the countries we do business with . 
  but do remember , ireland does not have the lowest rate , i believe estonia does , so it 's not * the * prime motivation . 
  if people complain about the double taxation treaties , they need to take it up with their own government . 
  the usa congress , for example , signed the double-taxation agreement because their corporations wanted it . 
  same reason they talk about changing it , but never do . 
  ireland is playing by the rules , created by the eu and usa . 
  now we are playing too well , they do n't like it ? 
  on your examples : - ** finland ** is the only example of a country we should have followed , but i would argue they are one the continent , and connected by borders to sweden and russia , a geographic advantage over ireland . 
  however , with their weakening tech sector lets see how they keep competitive . 
  - ** sweden ** has been wealthy comparatively since the 1600s , and spent a good chunk of the middle ages invading and plundering europe to build up a solid wealth core . 
  they also are on the continent with significant savings on distribution . 
  - ** south korea ** developed through horrendous worker abuse and a massive population . 
  it also had it 's proximity to prc and japan . 
  another fact often left out of all this is defence subsidies which supposedly do not break the eu and wto rules . 
  our eu partners pump billions in their heavy engineering industry this way , but this is somehow acceptable ? 
  for me , this is the ultimate ** `` do n't hate the player ; hate the game '' ** exercise . 
  the uk 's debauchery is in it 's own league , you could have a solid manufacturing base , but you gutted it . 
  in ireland 's case , how are we , without a colonial history ( i.e. 
  proper foundation for european wealth ) and geographically disadvantaged going to have an economy in this open free trade world ? 
  people seem to think geography has no merit in economic development on this sub .
