  is it a coincidence the areas around germany are wealthier ? 
  or that the entire mediterranean is an economic mess ? 
  how can ireland justify the building of factories , and then having to ship the stuff to the continent vs. poland ? 
  for example . 
  if ireland were a bigger country ( population ) we could theoretically have protectionism , but we are not . 
  a small population means economies to scale do n't exist . 
  but to stress my main point , singling out ireland is * ludicrous * . 
  any country has an economic trick up their sleeve , tax is just ** one ** of ours . 
  not to mention europe 's youngest population , english speaking populace , europe 's highest educated workforce and common law ( this one is seriously underrated in these discussions ) .

  sorry , fixed .

  not sure why the irish seem to want to beat themselves up about this .

  edit : to cover my transylvanian bases . 
  well the greeks acknowledge that the place exists independently . 
  they just do n't like the name . 
  argies , want the malvinas . 
  ** macedonia , man . 
  ** i find it hilarious that greeks continuously play the victim , while in their own backyard they 've been such a bully , for so long . 
  completely agree , it 's been a shambles . 
  the thing which really put petrol on the fire was merkel 's welcome . 
  she set up false hopes to desperate people . 
  worse still she 's changing her mind based on the political polls . 
  turkey is getting a lot of the blame , but in reality is * the * major syrian refugee benefactor . 
  it 's understandable if political leaders there want to ease the pressure on turkey itself . 
  ** the main thing is : ** eu never bothered getting a border control strategy prepared , and are now are paying the price . 
  the main issue are the states the refugees depart . 
  they have unreliable partners . 
  the e.u. 
  are complaining about the ** greeks ** not * `` stopping the flow '' * , whilst ignoring turkey is doing nothing about having non-turkish citizens : 1 . 
  cross their borders 2 . 
  go unbothered to the mediterranean 3 . 
  not doing much about stopping the smugglers at the coast . 
  for ** italy ** it is simply because gaddafi fell . 
  berlusconi made a deal for gaddafi to keep migrants in libya . 
  * no * gaddafi * no * deal . 
  there has also been allegations that the libyan militias are directly involved in the smuggling . 
  so again , a partner either * incapable * or * complicit * in the smuggling . 
  [ ** spain 's ** problems are certainly not that easy . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omqolxnqabi ) however , they at least have someone they can `` talk '' with about it . 
  migrants have to either go through morocco , or take the boat from senegal to the canaries . 
  as others have said morocco has at least a viable state , and does not openly allow migrants to go through their territory as much as libya and turkey . 
  edit : yes to those messaging , `` talk '' is a euphemism for bribe . 
  not for nothing , but i take your point only if the german 's say it in this context . 
  thanks for the share , i 've never heard about that . 
  makes it clearer why the polish would be watching for any mention of it . 
  so no to refueling russians , yes to selling brand new boats to saudi 's . 
   if those treaties can be trusted to be upheld by the irish that is . 
  have we ever broken any ? 
   yeah with ireland 's massive army and wealth ... oh . 
  luckily , we can veto any decision on further integration though , right ? 
  totally , the vitriol made me change my mind completely . 
  i 'll always vote for tax independence , and against nato membership/european army because of reddit . 
  it 's reparations .

  we 're still coming to a consensus on that . 
  from what i understand , you 'll be using fire-beacons to communicate with the continent . 
  so you 're right , likely nothing to worry about . 
  and rightfully so . 
  man those border roaming charges ... 
  things have a time and a place . 
  but it 's ludicrous to say any movements total contribution has been `` bad '' over 1000 + years . 
  the same way any ejit could link atheism and socialism to stalinism and say it 's `` bad '' . 
   generally catholicism is bad come on now , i 'm not a fan , but to say it was overall `` bad '' [ is a bit much ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/role_of_christianity_in_civilization ), 
   europe 's largest money whoring event [ most accurate description so far .

  i think start-ups should make better use of that money . 
  it 's just an ego boost , for `` founders '' that they can be in the same hall as elon musk . 
  i have to go every year , because it has become expected .
