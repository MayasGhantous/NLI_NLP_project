  ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/world/security-watch/backchannels/2015/0421/how-the-fall-of-qaddafi-gave-rise-to-europe-s-migrant-crisis-video ) :  qaddafi had a handy solution . 
  he offered to shut down his country and its coastal waters to the job seekers in exchange for $ 5 billion a year . 
  he pointed to his work with italy as proof he could get the job done . 
  in june 2009 , he signed a `` friendship '' agreement with italy that involved joint naval patrols against migrants and italy handing over migrants captured en route to europe to libya , no questions asked . 
  ** the number of africans caught trying to illegally enter italy fell by more than 75 percent that year ** . 
   do n't know it that was intentional , but that 's literally their slogan . 
  v for varufakis was good , but the rest is cringeworthy , and trying too hard . 
  it 's unnaturally forced . 
  well one of their posters has `` less skyline with our muslim brothers '' , with a not so subtle reference to 9/11 in the background . 
  if npd made that poster , it 's racist . 
  with a youth wing called `` hintner jugend '' . 
  very good .

  who said they would leave ? 
  the post i was responding to was implying that such as decision would destroy the irish economy . 
  i was just highlighting it is not just the irish economy which benefits from the international taxation rules at present . 
  estonia will just veto it along with the rest of us . 
  the big countries signed up to giving the small countries an equal vote on things like taxation . 
  yes , and my understanding is that is hugely advantageous to holding companies . 
  [ the effective corporation tax in estonia is zero ] ( http://taxmoneyhavens.com/2014/11/25/0-corporate-tax-in-the-european-union-yes-in-estonia/ ) .

  welcome tax-bro . 
  i 'm still hoping for some form of coup that can turn this whole thing around . 
  just because dr.strangelove says so ? 
  lisbon treaty protects state 's from this sort of show-boating thankfully , and the veto exists . 
  i think you 'll find its `` goodbye '' economically to the uk , netherlands , belgium , estonia , luxembourg too . 
  so would n't just be us having a problem with this . 
   i bet the eu would have a lot better image if more of its politicians would do their job like her . 
  we do love our commissar 's dictats . 
  `` hand 's off brussels '' exists for a reason . 
  good tip , had n't thought of that !, 
  the bastards !, 
  * `` it 's completely different '' *, 
  scumbags , undercutting all of europe 's car glass !, 
  all of what people have said above is valid , but for me the most important reason is they do n't want to admit they did anything `` illegal '' . 
  no state ever wants to admit they 've done something illegal . 
  but yes , there is a huge amount of jobs in ireland , cork specifically 6,000 people . 
  not to mention all the people in cork 's whose jobs are supplying the apple employees . 
  other than peacekeeping , the main role of the army is to provide internal security . 
  but in all honesty , if we are serious about `` neutrality '' we need to spend a hell of a lot more . 
  i ca n't find the source , but there was a study which ireland should spend the same as sweden if it wants a `` proper '' defence force . 
  the actual answer is it was led by nato , and we were n't invited . 
  we provided staff officer training in kabul , with about 7 guys . 
  oh so you are the guy who distributes the welfare ? 
  sorry if i 'm not replying fast enough . 
  it 's just that , as i 'm not welsh , i have a job . 
   we are an internationally recognised and unified country , unlike ireland . 
  boom !, 
  says who ? 
  wales is not an country/state . 
  it 's a province of britain . 
  got a un seat ? 
  what treaties does wales have with other countries ? 
  if you do n't exist , how are you unified ? 
  this is just getting embarrassing for you now . 
   as easy as squashing your original claims about a `` history of being conquered '' was . 
  not at all actually , you 're flailing around quite hard . 
  do you have to defend britain 's history so hard because it covers up your nation 's inadequacies ? 
  somehow , you see britain 's success as somehow wales ' ? 
   says the guy who gave up on his argument ages ago and is just shitposting now . 
  says the guy who went out of his way to be offensive to irish people , for no apparent reason . 
  you are a shit post . 
   what does it matter . 
  unlike ireland our patriotism comes from our country , not a chip on our shoulder against england . 
  muh oppression !, 
  muh potato famine !, 
  you ca n't have patriotism without a country , friend . 
  `` muh language , muh relevance , muh rugby , muh leeks '', 
  i guess the welsh education system is as bad as the wikipedia says . 
  you 're trolling is simply echoing statements you 've said multiple times . 
  try harder , buddy . 
  is that right ? 
  or is it leeks ? 
  well that , or our [ massive diaspora ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_diaspora ) , our commitment to a [ better world ] ( http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?docid=12453 ) , and our quite well known [ writers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:irish_nobel_laureates ) . 
  the wikipedia on wales talks about tom jones , dylan thomas , and miners . 
  [ do n't feel bad friend . 
  ] ( http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/how-earth-fallen-below-region-2034155 ), 
  i googled it . 
  never heard of the place before . 
  that dependency on welfare , probably is n't for the best long-term . 
  if it keeps you happy , continue to pretend relevance though . 
  you 've got a friend in me . 
  what is wales ? 
  so you think all of the `` colonies '' of britain , who say anything negative about the british occupations are just whingers ? 
  or just the irish ? 
  `` those kenyan 's never had it so good '' , * amiright * ? 
   but do n't let facts get in the ways of your little anti british rants . 
  i 've not said one thing anti-british , you have said now on multiple occasions anti-irish things.which again , shows who has the `` chip '' on their soldier . 
   i said it to you because what you said is factually bullshit . 
  it 's a fact that britain held ireland by force until we took independence . 
  it 's also a fact britain had a military force in northern ireland , which killed civilians up until the 1990s . 
  it 's a further fact that these events have shaped ireland 's view on nato , neutrality , and most likely the `` eu army '' . 
  those are facts friend , not opinions . 
  and what relevance you see your opinions about `` irish wingers '' having to do with a discussion on the eu army , i have no idea . 
   its easy to be smug and neutral when hiding behind the uk militarily and refusing to goto war with germany is nothing to be proud of . 
  not sure if we were smug about it , and people like my grandfather * did * fight in that war that happened ** 77 years ago ** . 
  to put that into context the imperial ( ? ),
