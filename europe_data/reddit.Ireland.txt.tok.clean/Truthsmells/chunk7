  military [ was going around ireland massacring civilians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bloody_sunday_ ( 1920 ) only about 18 years before the war started - can you imagine why there was n't massive public support to fight , and die for britain 's security ? 
  we were also neutral in the cold war , if that annoys you any more . 
  not sure how britain would save ireland from a thermo-nuclear icbm , to be honest . 
   ironic coming from a country that still cries and bitches about the two times it got invaded , which happened 500 and 800 years ago . 
  not sure that 's what ironic means , friend . 
  no one here brought that up , until you did . 
  it 's a silly statement to say ireland suffered no invasions , and more importantly occupations . 
  most of us remember northern ireland , rightly or wrongly traumatically , because it happened an hour a way from dublin . 
  it 's not rocket science . 
   im sure you and ireland are still deeply scarred because your great , great , great , great , great , great , great , great , great , great , great , great , great , great , great grandfather 's country got invaded . 
  do you say that to all your former colonies , or just irish people because we are `` white '' ? 
  i 'm sure you are one of those people who think indian 's miss `` ye olde empire '' as well . 
  boris johnson had that sort of intelligent comment for obama as well , if i remember . 
  is this how we get everyone to pay back their debts ? 
   do n't worry , ireland is definitely not a key country for this to work . 
  the only relevant point i 've seen here . 
  honestly , lads if the russians get as far as us , i think you can just ask the americans . 
  calm now , your statelessness is showing . 
  vikings before normans . 
  celts befor viking 's . 
  just sayin ' . 
  well to be fair , friend we also have been officially neutral for the last 80 years . 
  i do n't think you are bringing up a valid point , and you were very quick to bring up the `` chip '' argument you britbongs seem to think is the be-all and end-all . 
  which says more about you , honestly . 
  now the question if our neutrality is compatible with an ever-closer union , which wants its own army , is entirely valid . 
  * demuns and their filthy taig magic : `` democracy '' *, 
  honestly , i had mixed this up with one of the 50 ( or whatever ) replies i did on apple . 
  i simply did n't think anyone would think the chap saying `` collapsed '' meant `` collapsed '' rather than the irish state made a huge contribution to the bailouts , that the danger of banking `` contagion '' was real , and that unlike the other states ( for me spain is the best example ) the irish state ended up taking the full hit , whilst other eu banking sectors were saved ( ? ) . 
  but it is silly to think that the eurozone itself would have collapsed if we did not have the banking bailout . 
  we can talk about the banking sector * potentially * collapsing , but , obviously , not the eurozone . 
   in fact provide any source for the claim that the eurozone would have collapsed and that further , you were wrong in all the replies where you pretended you had provided sources , and that i was ignoring those sources . 
  buddy , i provided sources as good as anyone else does on reddit . 
  you 're an idiot , who is pathetically invested in not being wrong online - which is just plain sad . 
  there is no point , as for you journalism and official reports do not qualify as `` sources '' . 
   you 're an idiot which is bad enough , but you 're also pathetically invested in not being wrong online - which is just plain sad . 
  you literally just described yourself , friend . 
  two sources , both you chose to ignore and come off like the autist you are . 
  you 're an idiot , who is pathetically invested in not being wrong online - which is just plain sad . 
  as if anything would change your mind regardless . 
  he was wrong to say the `` collapse of the eurozone '' , however . 
  regardless , the `` thick '' i meant was `` beyond stubborn '' , rather that `` stupid '' . 
  your ma ' . 
  try harder . 
  i 'd imagine you 're a `` better together '' voter , so ? 
  you 're thick . 
  tell me what is an appropriate source , if not a first hand interviews with germany 's finance minister , the president of the imf , and nearly all of the players from the ecb and the bailout ? 
  the second source is from the imf official analysis . 
  i think you 'd wan na look up what an actual `` source is '' , given that you do n't seem to believe journalism or official reports from the main body involved are . 
  but go on trolling , genius . 
  you 're posts have just been one silly commentary after another : `` muh taxes , muh fairness ... '',

  '' ] ( http://voxeu.org/article/imf-s-analysis-irish-bailout ) - the imf 's analysis of the bailout 2015 . 
  it 's entirely about transfer-pricing and treasury holdings through corporate vehicles in ireland . 
  i 'm a bit knackered , but appreciate the logical debate , rather than the usual `` the irish have been eating at the trough too long '' that i 've seen on reddit this week . 
   seriously ? 
  paying $ 8bn ( 13bn with interest ) less taxes would not affect the benefits of a company , and would not allow it to have an edge over its competitors ? 
  $ 8bn divided by 25 years is a rounding error for a company like apple . 
  it 's a company with approx $ 45 billion revenue . 
  in fact at the time apple and the irish state signed the deal in the 80s both looked like they were going no where fast . 
  apple 's market share regrew well after the tax `` deal '' was signed . 
  it might be argued it made a bad situation from being worse in the early 90s , but given how it was not `` direct support '' ( like cash ) the benefits or not are opaque , and can be debated forever using accounting . 
  my issue is with how the eu commission evaluated it , and decided to `` shock and awe '' corporations , and purposely trying to harm ireland 's reputation , only recently repaired . 
  i also take issue with the idea that the commission should be the prosecutor and the judge ; honestly , i 'm not sure if this is a civil law vs. common law perspective , but it seems to me rife for abuse , so i can not take it seriously . 
  for me the commission is the prosecution , and the actual debate/trial will be the appeal . 
  you 've quoted vestager 's opinion on the matter . 
  [ reuters ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-apple-politics-insight-iduskcn1190tx ) has a great article today talking more about the politics of the decision . 
  highlighting to me the likelihood that ireland is being scapegoated because it 's a small country . 
  on the secrecy aspect of the tax deal i have no idea . 
  generally , secrecy is used to attract fdi because of competition , but of course it should be within bounds of the rules . 
  the court ( s ) will decided in the end , thankfully . 
  it 's a valid challenge , but i would argue the judgements are not comparable . 
  ** [ the edf case  ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-orders-france-to-recover-state-aid-from-edf-1437559208 ) ** edf is a market monopolist in france , and has a strong market share in other markets in the eu . 
  france signed no special `` deal '' with edf but simply `` chose '' to ignore asking for certain taxes when they restructured the company in the 80s/90s and more importantly , france owns 85 % of edf . 
  the french government strategically chose to protect it 's power company , and and encourage it 's expansion . 
  france and edf appealed the decision twice they were found guilty , then innocent , then guilty again in 2015 , i 'm not sure if they plan to appeal ( or if they even can ) . 
  ** [ the apple case  ( http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21706267-european-commissions-assault-technology-giant-wrong-bruised-apple?fsrc=scn/tw/te/pe/ed/bruisedapple ) ** the irish state owns 0 % of apple . 
  apple is in no way a monopolist in ireland , and especially not in europe - so would gain no serious market advantage that would effect competition , and ireland had and agreement signed in the 80s based on internationally legal price-transfer laws . 
  so what the eu commission is arguing is ireland sought to provide a competitive advantage to a foreign corporation , which is n't a monopolist , and which had a specific tax agreement signed pre-ireland agreeing to the competition clauses . 
  edf on the other hand is a complete monopolist , which the french state simply did not tax on it 's capital assets to assure it 's continued monopoly , and hope for it 's expansion into other markets in europe . 
  i think the [ recent economist article ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21706267-european-commissions-assault-technology-giant-wrong-bruised-apple?fsrc=scn/tw/te/pe/ed/bruisedapple ) sums it up best :  it says apple 's arrangements with ireland , which resulted in low-single-digit tax rates , amounted to preferential treatment , thereby violating the eu 's state-aid rules . 
  ** making this case involved some creative thinking . 
  the commission relied on an expansive interpretation of the `` transfer-pricing '' principle ** that governs the price at which a multinational 's units trade with each other . 
   ** having shifted the goalposts ** in this way , the commission then applied its new thinking to deals first struck 25 years ago . 
  back then , there was no reason for apple to think it might one day fall foul of the state-aid rules . 
  the firm shook hands with a sovereign government , which continues to defend the arrangement to this day . 
  even if the plan had been legally suspect at the time , it makes as much sense for subsequent penalties to fall on the country . 
  none of this has anything to do with tax , and everything to do with illegal state aid . 
  something a lot of countries are guilty of within the eu . 
  we never signed anything handing even one iota of our tax policy to brussels . 
  hence the appeal . 
  tune . 
  your concerns are ethical , and have nothing to do with the commissions investigation , or accusations .
