  the commission 's allegations are that ireland allegedly provided an unfair advantage to apple , supposedly through state aid , in this case a unique tax agreement . 
  if the irish state had provided the same opportunity to all , the commission would not have launched the investigation . 
  the poor system of transfer pricing and accounting rules is worldwide , not unique to ireland or europe . 
  merkel is more concerned that the eu commission is actively attempting to , in her view , increase their power over taxation , indirectly , or directly . 
  well there was no point trying to change his mind . 
  paddys = bad . 
  # * never !, 
  pay your tax britain . 
  then i 'll take it easy . 
  your ma . 
  it 's awesome that you are british and you thought it important enough to call yourself lion . 
  who said i was irish ? 
  just live there sometimes . 
  just think it 's hilarious that a british person , given * the city of london * actually can try and demonize another country for doing a fraction of the same . 
  i 'm sorry , but your point seems to have mixed up things . 
  are you referring to the eu commission 's allegation of uncompetitive support via state aid ? 
  the eu commission has no remit , and has made no allegation that ireland has done anything illicit in taxation , other than supposedly give an unfair advantage to a specific company . 
  the issue is about competition , not tax . 
  ** but on your specific question : **  how would you feel if tomorrow austria decided to give apple et al a better tax deal and ireland lost 15000 high paying jobs ? 
  personally , i think all this stuff cheapens `` brand ireland '' . 
  the only reason i 'm throwing shit back over the wall is i think it 's farcical that people whose countries do the same , if not worse . 
  i think austria has n't sacrificed social services in order to do , as ireland unfortunately has . 
  the irish state was encouraged by the eu to follow this exact strategy in a hope of building our way out of the grinding poverty . 
  we followed all the rules set out by the `` big boys '' and are now being told `` you are playing to well '' . 
  unfortunately , in the globalized world ireland 's geographical disadvantages are too much to overcome by `` education '' alone . 
  so if austria made the offer , i 'd say `` make a better offer '' . 
  i do n't see what choice you perceive ireland to have ? 
  this is the world , and we 're just living in it . 
   the irish recovery was built entirely on allowing corporations to make more money while giving ireland a small slice . 
  based on the [ eu forcing us to take a bailout ] ( https://euobserver.com/news/124049 ) that tripled our national debt that we should n't have , i think all 's square . 
  regardless , your argument is mean spirited . 
  if the big companies just wanted low taxation they would have gone to estonia . 
  we have a highly skilled labour force , who speak english , easy immigration laws , and the common law system which is the most like the us 's in europe . 
  there are multiple factors , not simply tax competitiveness . 
  typical . 
  you do n't know anything about our tax affairs , nor , obviously what the eu commission opinion was even about . 
  it was about an allegation of unfair competition . 
  so i have no idea why we would sort * anything * . 
  whereas britain and it 's hand-me-down empire remnants help launder money all over the world , storing up to 2 trillion in stolen money in its overseas territories . 
  actual criminal stuff . 
  but please , pontificate more . 
  i 'm sure that big improvement in quality of life is just around the corner post-brexit . 
  you are right . 
  britain does n't benefit from them , * the city * does , as outlined [ here ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/07/britain-tax-havens-queen-secrecy-justice-network ) . 
  it would be for the best if they decided to go independent . 
  then they will develop their own economies , save the uk government development funds and tax loss . 
  could n't wiki quick enough on the specific state , sorry . 
  but in the end of the day , it 's a very convenient argument that they are independent unless they go `` too far '' . 
  britain could make all of the transfer-pricing issues of the bot to harmonize to european norms . 
  to say britain garners no benefit , and has no control over the tax affairs of the overseas territories is simply disingenuous . 
  [ britain rules the world of tax havens . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/07/britain-tax-havens-queen-secrecy-justice-network ) . 
  commin ' for your financial services . 
  be nothing left . 
  just like your ancestors told ` ye . 
  britain has power to replace the governments in all of them , and could make them abide to british company law tomorrow if it wanted . 
  let 's not forget the tax haven in [ the centre of london . 
  ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/economy/2011/02/london-corporation-city ), 
  of course we can . 
  in fact we 'll be stealing doubly now . 
  i certainly have been made progressively feel like that over the last few days here on reddit . 
  i do n't like the tax issues etc. , but i love how everyone thinks their countries would have it so much better without them . 
  that we are somehow robbing them , and there is constantly the old `` you owe us '' in some shape or form . 
  i 've gone from * `` we need to work with our good friends '' * to * `` they can get fucked , block everything '' * having read all their bullshit . 
  it 's definitely been enlightening . 
  * tax-bros ?? 
  you immediately go to stereo types and casual racism . 
  i really hope you do n't represent the average french person . 
  i could n't even read the drivel you wrote . 
  yes , yes , france 's cock is sooooooo big : ok ? 
  ireland suffered an engineered famine to purposely starve half our population to death . 
  do you have funny quips about jews and gas too ? 
  maybe you would n't mind lepen winning . 
  you are letting your own insecurities show with all these comments . 
  i 'm sorry france has n't met your expectations , but you should n't project those insecurities onto others . 
  if you want us to all say how important france is , and how great flunch is , and how amazing your economy is , i 'm sorry . 
   seems to assume that every government wants to design a better tax system and crack down on tax avoidance . 
  party-poopers * amiright ? 
  yeah usually thats a no-no . 
  the royal marines is incredibly difficult to get into . 
  im a bit surprised they would n't have been able to background check him out . 
  there is a [ historical precedence ] ( http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/ireland-1845-to-1922/the-fenian-movement/ ) , but the idea that this guy was sent by someone , or was directed - i do n't see it . 
  especially , bro . 
  do we know all that ? 
  he 's from northern ireland , but he could just have been a dangerous nutter . 
  rather than an organised whatever . 
   and the people who have accounts  you love to mention cyprus . 
  do you know the banks took money from the clients ? 
  i think its disgusting what happened the cypriot people , and everyone should be worried about that . 
  it just shows that not all eu countries get treated equally . 
   go ahead , make your own irip party if the eu was so bad and awful to you . 
  tell us how it goes  wow , that was sudden . 
  so for you it 's we agree with unelected bureaucrats or get out ? 
  sounds pretty silly . 
  believe it or not most irish people believe in the eu because we philosophically are pro united europe . 
  not because we want to make a few extra euros - hence why we have zero anti-eu parties , unlike your failed state . 
   and your `` vanity '' projects is a bunch of bs . 
  did italy have vanity projects ? 
  romania ? 
  france ?
