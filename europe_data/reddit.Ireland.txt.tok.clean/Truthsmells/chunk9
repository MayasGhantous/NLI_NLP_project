  your level of national debt is about the same as ours . 
  your gdp and gnp is over the roof . 
  another black or white example . 
  those countries , and yours especially simply have poorly managed their economies for decades . 
  we should feel bad for you guys because you wo n't reform ? 
  because you have debt , we should have debt ? 
  good logic , bro . 
   stop bitching , you 're living the good life . 
  you 're not greece or portugal . 
  this ** entitled attitude ** is getting quite annoying . 
  coming from a french person this comment is hilarious . 
  it 's on our balance sheet now regardless . 
  does n't mean it was correct , or fair for the eu , ecb and imf to put it on there in the first place . 
  private corporations ( banks ) borrowed huge sums from eu banks ( deutsche bank etc. ), 
  and lent it to developers in ireland , but also to projects all around the world . 
  we were n't like greece and had the olympics , for example . 
  there is no vanity projects paid for by the taxpayer . 
  these a private corporations mistakes bailed out by the state . 
  normally when a company goes bankrupt , its tough shit for the bondholders and creditors . 
  in this case most of the major pension funds and major banks across europe . 
  so the eu commission , ecb , imf scared our ignorant leaders into bailing them out ( one of the best one 's was roman ambramovich getting a payout ... ) . 
  the irish housing bubble only accounts for a chunk of the total bank debt that is now on the irish states balance sheet . 
  there is also the other nice bonus of knowing that if you follow all the rules you get no write-downs , but if you pull a greece you do get them . 
  make 's sense . 
  i think you might want to read about what [ the european court of auditors ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/european-commission-s-handling-of-irish-bailout-strongly-criticised-1.2510807 ) and [ the imf ] ( http://voxeu.org/article/imf-s-analysis-irish-bailout ) had to say about the bailout , it 's terms , and ireland 's overall treatment by the eu commission and ecb . 
  but ... but the robots ? 
  they took our jobs !, 
   edit : minor note . 
  this 'll probably go for the general court , not the ecj . 
  now that , i 'm ignorant about . 
  let the wikipedia dive begin . 
  what we were talking about was our opinion . 
  none of us here are saying commission has done anything that directly `` takes over '' our taxation . 
  what we are saying is there is a desire to go after our competitive taxation model ( apple aside ) , and our worry is that ireland wo n't get a fair hearing in the long run , as its small enough to fail . 
  we are alluding to a debate on states ' rights . 
  and this whole process , and especially the media and other member states reactions , should serve as a wake-up call for ireland . 
  in my view , your view , of my view is mistaken . 
  what we were talking about was this is a first step . 
  the commission has long wanted to harmonise corporate taxation , with ireland and the uk being the states most against it . 
  guess who is leaving the club ? 
  i actually admonish a guy for implying that this specific case had anything to with tax lower down . 
  this is all about fairness in competition . 
   all that 's said is that you can not allow corporations individualized deals . 
  given that we have only heard the commission 's point of view on this , i guess the ~ ~ ecj ~ ~ courts will decide if those allegations are true or not . 
  well to be honest , mate : spain had to get a banking bailout for the same reasons we did , but was able to force the debt on to the banks , and continuously bail them them out through the ecb 's liquidity . 
  none of the debt was transferred to spain 's balance sheet , as their finance minister [ `` had learned from ireland 's mistake '' ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-06-14/irish-tell-spain-to-imagine-the-worst-in-banking-bailout ) . 
  we were not allowed to pull an `` iceland '' either , another knock against sovereignty , because it was a `` systemic risk '' . 
  it was a failure of our leaders to not stand up and fight for a better deal , because they had become complacent and simply believed anything the commission , ecb and imf told them . 
  so forgive us for being bitter about it . 
  [ so does the eu , just non-american ones ] ( https://lobbyfacts.eu/charts-graphs ) . 
   why compete in being the country taking in the lowest tax ? 
  better be the country that have the best education , infrastructure and so on . 
  i completely agree with you . 
  ireland is currently 15th in the oecd on education , and it 's rising . 
  we need to ween ourselves off the fdi tit . 
  but to be honest we are entering that developmental phase now , so it should be less of a concern . 
  the geographic disadvantages ( logistical costs , energy costs etc ) are real , and will be real for any and all businesses in ireland native or foreign . 
  the state will always need to help equalise the playing field with other european countries . 
   the problem is also that countries are not only choosing to not tax companies in their country . 
  they are at the same time often taking away taxes from business taking place in other countries by offering a non existing tax ... . also eu does n't have a common view on how we should organize our taxes , i say that we need more common policies ( if not only to make the euro work ) and you say we need the opposite . 
  the same is happening in eu . 
  and here lies the problem . 
  there are no transfer-pricing rules . 
  and a big reason for this is that large european companies have lobbied against it , as they benefit from it , too . 
  for example , nearly all big e-commerce sites handle their payment processing in luxembourg - not just amazon . 
   the only thing that matters is if apple did cheat against current rules and gained an unfair advantage due to lower taxes than other companies in ireland . 
  exactly . 
  we 've heard from the prosecution , now it 's time for the defence . 
  you wo n't find many people in ireland supporting it for the sake of apple . 
  but i for one think the commission 's case is nebulous , and their proposed `` punishment '' well beyond what would be expected based on historically similar cases . 
  ftfy  ** access to ** the eu ~ ~ fed ~ ~ was a huge part of the the celtic tiger 's success . 
  whether we like it or not , u.s. 
  corporations `` fed '' the celtic tiger ( excluding the shitty property speculation part ... that was us ... :-( ), 
  no , you would be a moron if you adamantly keep aggressively making a point that has zero relevance to the situation : which you have done . 
  i was , in fact , hoping you were purposely trolling . 
  it shows how much the last years have gone to some eu citizens heads . 
  the myth of superiority in character and productivity continues . 
  good luck with that , `` homie '' . 
  that 's personally my view as well . 
  this is about eliminating competition for fdi among the states , and attempting to harmonise them , and eventually taxation as a whole . 
  the eu 's policy on * everything * . 
  now imagine a situation where you get ** no ** extra benefit ( with harmonised corp tax etc. ), 
  for setting up in ireland vs. germany , despite ireland 's huge geographic disadvantage . 
  why on earth would anyone invest in any countries that are not in central europe in that scenario ? 
  ever since 2008 the potential ongoing benefits to eu states on the `` periphery '' are getting smaller and smaller . 
  why do n't you tell me who pays for it so ? 
  you are either a troll , or a moron . 
  you have absolutely no idea what the issue was about . 
  it is n't about tax , or no tax . 
  it 's about that ireland is accused of disproportionately helping apple gain an uncompetitive position . 
  germany , italy , and france are currently having similar cases and fines for helping steel , banking and other `` national '' interests . 
  the difference is apple is an american corporation . 
  so perhaps you should `` grow up '' , and stop being such an eu fanboy . 
  people like you are the most worrying . 
  eu commission = automatically correct do n't be a sucker . 
  this is all about money , and european corporate interests . 
  i 'm still waiting for vestager to properly go after germany and nordstream - i wonder why she has n't . 
  luckily there is law . 
  it 's every defendants right to an appeal . 
  what i find most worryingly is how many people here on / r/europe just assume the commission , and vestager in particular , is working for `` justice '' , and is inherently `` good '' .
