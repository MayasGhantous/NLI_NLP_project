  i think countries that are not happy with the eu should leave it . 
  there ca n't be 27 seperate deals for 27 member states , and i get that some countries may want out of the european project at this point - but it is better for the rest of the eu that only countries that actually still want to be in on it should stay . 
  i want ireland to stay in the eu , but if the czechs or the brittish want out that is their choice , and not really for me to have an opinion on . 
  tyrone is northern ireland though . 
  `` ireland '' means the republic of ireland , since `` ireland '' is the oficial name of the state . 
  unless someone specifically mentions they mean the whole island which is also called ireland , i 'd assume they mean the republic . 
  but they do so much good for the sick and poor / s seriously , some of these christian extremists need to be treated the same way as muslim extrimists . 
  they are just as bad . 
  totally called for . 
  they weasel their way out of paying compensation to their victims whenever they can , still try and deny everything until absolutly proven otherwise , and they have the nerve to talk about others morals , all while exploiting the shit out of poor people in the third world . 
  the catholic church is rotten to the core , and if you do n't think they are not still covering up abuse today you are fooling yourself . 
  they held adults against their will in slavery in ireland [ until 1996 ! ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magdalene_asylum ) . 
  you can be 100 % sure they are still doing the same in poor countries where nobody questions them . 
  the church in ireland is dying out , hopefully ith happens elsewhere too within my lifetime . 
  no most people here do n't really care . 
  you are technically correct - the best kind of correct - ftfy, 
  if she weighs the same as a duck , she is made of wood - and therefore must be a witch . 
  great logic . 
  what 's wrong with the guardian ? 
  mixing up the bullet shooty kill things could be human mistake , but could be excusable because of translation errors rather than sensationalism . 
  this could become an important thing in future though since some news agencies are experimenting with bots writing articles themselves . 
  here 's an example . 
  i get the feeling from some of the word order that the original was french translated to english by a bot . 
  it is rare to see stuff like `` hydraulic ram '' translated as `` water sheep '' these days but machine translation is quite a bit away from being perfect yet and can still probably mix up machine gun and assault rifle, 
  pretty much . 
  belfast is in northern ireland . 
  different country , different economy , different government . 
  the population of the metro cork area is still only around 1/4 of the dublin metro area . 
  someone posted this map on reddit to show where 1/2 of the population is located . 
  i agree with you . 
  even though i 've availed of rent subsidy in the past . 
  ( what the government use for maximum rent in this is actually fiction , you will not find anywhere to rent in dublin for under what they think are the maximum prices ) what is needed is rent controls , and better legal protection for tenants , and the availability of long term leases . 
   the only people to actually benefit will be company 's maintaining low wages and landlords . 
  that sounds very fine gael ... 
  but yeah that is the jist of it, 
  yes . 
  something like 1/2 of the population live within an hours drive of dublin , dublin is more than ~ ~ 10 ~ ~ 4 times the size of the next largest city ... yeah there is a huge gap between dublin and the rest of the country, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moral_panic think `` stranger danger '' in the 80s and people from the 70s til present who are convinced crime has been constantly increasing - even through crime has been at all time lows in the developed world for decades . 
  group think and herd panic make people afraid of all the wrong things . 
  and witch hunts . 
  last time ( before their previous gov ` t ) they had one of them was 1945 !, 
  i had to google it . 
  i 'm really oversimplifying it , other parties , particularly the internal parties in scotland , northern ireland and wales have some effect on what the uk as a whole does - but there is usually just one party really `` in charge '', 
  there are other parties but the big two are the conservatives and labour . 
  one of the two is usually in a majority government . 
  it is pretty much red v blue situation like the us in most european countries coalitions of parties usually form a government , and one party winning outright is more unusual, 
  the 2 party system , with `` extremes '' of left and right . 
  multi party systems and coalition governments are more common in europe ... i think, 
  it is still kind of big brother like . 
  fined for not carrying id everywhere ?!? ... 
  that is beyond fucked up . 
  #he said they 're selling chawklates !, 
  you can get a beer in the fucking vatican on good friday . 
  not in a bar in ireland though ... 
  the light switch on her right is off , so if the water does get in she is still safe . 
  heh , when i was young i always heard about people being held at gunpoint , or other bad stuff happening at gunpoint on the tv or radio . 
  i thought gunpoint was just a really shitty place and wondered why people kept going there . 
  bus timetables are also approximate at best , complete works of fiction normally . 
  or just be more careful , considering ways to stay safe when meeting online strangers irl . 
  victim blaming helps nobody , and whatever is considered promiscuous is subjective . 
  in other words - that 's just like your opinion , man . 
  [ plottwist ] : / u/hatenotgriefhot : fears a future lack of slovenian gay singles . 
  they were kind of his thing . 
  ahh . 
  we had a similar situation here too . 
  there were still legal differences between marriage and civil unions here , which could not be changed without a referendum here . 
  now the state no longer offers civil unions , only marriage - couples who previously had civil partnerships can `` upgrade '' it to marriage for free with a seperate legal document . 
  in ireland they tried to confuse a really simple yes/no question , wehter or not we added the following line to our constitution :  * `` marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex . 
  '' * the no side made claims about adoption , abortion , anything you could possibly think of . 
  this was another crazy example of how they campaigned : http://imgur.com/ul4zqqc, 
  really , they are actually trying to take away legal recognition ? 
  of people that are already married ? 
  we had the same type of campaign here http://i.imgur.com/75ihvcw.jpg by the way , the image of the family featured on millions of advertisments nationwide on the no posters had posed for a generic stock photo , and did not support the no campaign or consent to their image being used . 
  they tried taking them to court but it turned out `` mothers and fathers matter '' had purchased the image legally . 
  i hope it does pass . 
  the situation in slovenia is different from how it was in ireland , with polls before the referendum showing a stronger yes majority in the months and years before the vote . 
  in slovenia the polls are much closer with neither side having a statistically significant majority . 
  interestig reading , their government had already planned on legalising equal marriage , before church types petitioned for a referendum . 
  not have potato , such is life . 
  this was posted 2 months ago and there was much very lame arguing as to his nationality or the nationality of his nobel prize . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3np3od/irish_scientist_wins_nobel_prize_for_medicine/ headline could read ( london ) derry born , dublin educated , scientist who grew up in donegal but done the vast majority of his work , and spent most of his life in the united states and also has citizenship there gets nobel prize for work he done in america . 
  reddit has pointless argument about which country gets nobel prize and even more pointless argumet over the name of the town he was born in . 
  ( he is american more than anything imo , just like marie curie 's work would be counted as a french nobel prize win - even though she was born in poland ), 
   800 euros per month for the rest of your life , you 'll rather beg on the streets of finland . 
  cost of living differences , life in ireland would be pretty shit at $ 800/month , that is roughly what social welfare is here for unemployed anyway . 
  i think living in finland would be even more expensive . 
  also citizenship , - i do n't think 5 years of begging on the street counts . 
  you would need 5 years in a proper tax paying job contributing to socciety . 
  the irish money looked beautiful with aincent celtic artwork , never realised how cool it was until they re designed the irish passport with a lot of old celtic art in the same style as our money used to be . 
  actually , the first targets of bombers are typically anti aircraft installations * . 
  i could understand someone sititig in an anti aircraft place and thinking it could be he lives or i live type decision . 
  this is likley the same reasoning the guy in buk missile thing shot at mh17 had , thinking a ukranian fighter jet was using it for cover .

  if they wanted more publicity from this thing they could n't buy it ... like in the show fr ted , when the bishop told the two priests to protest the opening of a film ... and people ended up coming from gdansk to ireland to see it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjzsddnp8u,

  top kek, 
  you have a better grasp of it than a lot of irish people to be honest . 
  i think the rule is you ca n't cross post . 
  you can still link to r/polandball,
