  if you can speak only english just send an english cv . 
  if you speak only french then send a french version , only if you speak both send both versions . 
  i assume the same language the job you are applying for was advertised in would be ok . 
  i would not be too farmiliar with scots gaelic but the few things i have seen written were similar , the scottish accent would make the spoken language a bit harder for me to understand , actually i would have troulble understanding someone from donegal or northern ireland speaking irish because of their accent . 
  it is a bit like spanish and portugese ( i know some spanish but no portuguese ) , i could recognise some written words in portugese and get a fair idea of the context . . spoken i would not have a hope . 
  i would have thought the opposite too , written - from the small ammounts of scots gaelic i have seen they look pretty similar . 
  cider snob lol ... 
  i rembember the days when that was the drink of the homeless and alcoholics . 
  [ then again the line between hipster and hobo is pretty blurred ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_ztrxaxz-g ), 
  as their mass produced ones go mgd , pbr are perfectly acceptable beers . 
  samuel adams is alright too . 
  american beer = / = bud or coors, 
  the bud in america tastes different to the piss called bud they sell in europe . 
  it is a decidedly average quality beer . 
  i am not sure about bud light . 
  as american mass produced beers go miller genuine draft is pretty good . 
  german confirmed !, 
  those things do have some huge disadvantages , they take 8 or 9 hours to cool in the fridge and if you move them , or they get knocked on by anything you will be able to pour nothing but foam . 
  and in ireland anyway they work out more expensive than cans . 
  they are a marketing gimmick really . 
  yeah but $ 4.30-4 .40 is the bog standard ( no pun intended ) that you would expect to pay in the majority of places , a regular town center pub or hotel bar for instance . 
  if a barman told me $ 4.38 for a heineken i would not think it was particularly expensive or cheap . 
  they are working , not on minimum wage . . 
  the guy who does most of the drinking has a wife who is working in a pretty good job , and she drinks nearly as much as he does . 
  thankfully they have no kids . 
  i 'm astonished neither are dead/fired by now really . 
  it is actually kind of sad . 
  you would be surprised at the level a functioning alcoholic can get to . 
  a few of us at work have tried talking to the guy but it it like talking to a wall . 
  it gives the source as www.pintprice.com as $ 4.38 for average price of a pint of lager in ireland . 
  which sounds about right i think , price of a pint in a pub is roughly around that . 
  could be cheaper or more expensive depending on where you go but that does sound about normal . 
  minimum wage is $ 8.65 / hour, 
  what speed is the car doing to keep up with the helicopter ? 
  he looks like he is seriously eating road . 
  as far as i know the rebels have been using pretty sophisticated uavs , but those were only volunteer drones, 
  done the maths for ireland and it is only 315 beers ... not 333 assuming a 40 hour work week . 
  :( it averages around 10 pints a day ... and i know people who can and do drink like that . 
  i would not recommend it . 
  the northern part that is of kebab ? 
  i think it probably has a lot to do with the amount of construction going on . 
  i do n't remember having a power cut in years , but the last time i had one there was a letter from the power company telling me there would be a planned outage for a few hours while they connected new buildings to the network . 
  i 'd imagine whenever some unfortunate polish person showed their license at a checkpoint they got wrestled to the ground and handcuffed while the cops laughed and said `` ha ha we finally caught this notorious bastard ! '', 
  they are taking money from you , since i am ok with that you assume i am ok with taking the next logical leap to the extreme . 
  taxation is nowhere near comparable with forcing someone to live under military law against their will . 
  separating someone from their friends family , relationships , interrupting or even stopping their education at the age of 18 , making them do extra unpaid work whenever they like ect . 
  and here is the thing , when they are done with the conscription they still have to pay tax . 
  the thing is with a job nobody is forcing you to stay there , you can always quit if you do n't like the tax . 
  get a lower paying job and pay lower tax or even no tax in some cases . 
   [ the government ] deciding what you expend your time on . 
  that is it in a nutshell . 
  you are not free . 
  they probably would let you , it is an eu country and you can move there if you like and get yourself conscripted - although you are probably over the age limit like most supporters of conscription . 
  it is different from taxation . 
  people are free to do whatever kind of work or money making activity they choose ( or not ) as long as it is legal , and a certain percentage of that money goes to the government . 
  that is totally different from being coerced into forced labor . 
  i am not anti military or anything but forcing people to join is morally wrong . 
  rt\u00c9 is actually not bad for international news as regards not having very obvious agendas or biases ... anything within ireland however ... different story ... 
  they will only hold you against your will for 6 months instead of 12 . 
  how very generous . 
  you may have done your time filling sandbags and sleeping in a hole in the ground , you may even have liked it - but you * chose * to do it . 
  not everyone wants to be in the military who are you to judge others for not doing the same things as you . 
  if it is such a generous offer , why do n't you go to finland and do their reserves for 6 months . 
  that tongue twister is impressive . 
  i am not really able to say it myself . 
  the austria part of the empire was busy with skiing at the time i believe . 
  we do n't * not like * the uk ... well most of the time anyway ... depending on context ... 
  it 's complicated ... 
  but yeah the level of insanity in ni is too danm high . 
  greece is well liked here too , and we are still kind of broke . 
  the greek attitude twords anyone who tries to tell them what to do is very similar to ours :p the troilka were mean to both of our countries but you guys had a worse time than us . 
  we get on very well with poland and the baltics too since there is so many of them here . 
  ah slovenia being rich and alpine sounds right . 
  it is kind of bad that i know nothing at all about moldova , they have 3.5 million people . . 
  i should at least know something about them . 
  sorry , i spent like 5 minutes and next to zero effort making this and i have already pissed off turkey , the portuguese and the moldovans :(, 
  most of us could label them all correctly . 
  i just could n't think of a stereotype for maldova or slovenia . 
  yeah we have lots of strawberries , they even grow in the wild in places . 
  wexford and kildare have most of the strawberry farms . 
  is true , all other countries besides kazakhstan have inferior potassium . 
  careful now ! ^ allthough ^ i_still_think_fg_are_kind_of_blue-shirts . 
  that is the origins of the 2 main parties . 
  they were the political wings of the opposite sides during the [ irish civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_civil_war ) 28 june 1922 -- 24 may 1923 after the war of independence the country was very divided in their support for the [ anglo - irish treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-irish_treaty ) the main points of contention within the treaty were : * crown forces would withdraw from most of ireland . 
  ireland was to become a ** self-governing dominion of the british empire ** , a status shared by australia , canada , newfoundland , new zealand and the union of south africa . 
  * as with the other dominions , the ** king would be the head of state ** of the irish free state ( saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann ) and would be ** represented by a governor general ( representative of the crown ) . 
  ** * members of the new free state 's parliament would be ** required to take an oath of allegiance ** to the irish free state . 
  a secondary ** part of the oath was to `` be faithful to his majesty king george v , his heirs and successors by law ** , in virtue of the common citizenship '' . 
  * ** northern ireland ** ( which had been created earlier by the government of ireland act ) would have the option of withdrawing from the irish free state within one month of the treaty coming into effect . 
  these conditions were unacceptable to a lot of the irish population at the time , who wanted a full republic . 
  the treaty was accepted by voters , however the context was churchill had promised there would ** `` immediate and terrible war '' ** [ with britain , again ] should the treaty be rejected . 
  the government of ireland ever since has swapped back and forth between these two parties , and a lot of people still vote for whichever side their grandparents supported . 
  the civil war was a complete mess , where brothers literally fought against each other , around twice as many were killed than in the war of independence , and all the politics for the next 80 years were somehow affected by it . 
  i would n't call it very low risk , these people can literally just dissapear , are the russians really going to go complaining `` what happened to our spy '' ... 
  i doubt it . . 
  they 'll just buy a new asset . 
  best case scenario for someone that gets caught is they get used as a human bargaining chip between governments , or they are caught in public and given a trial and sentence . 
  worst case - they go to some black site and become an un-person . 
  that 's the thing about not wearing a uniform and trying to do military type stuff - you really are on your totally on your own if something goes wrong . 
  it is either really really brave or really really dumb .
