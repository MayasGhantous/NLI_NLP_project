  they had a referendum on getting rid of fptp and they decided to keep it . 
  that is exactly a war . 
  go some place , shoot some humans , shoot enough humans and you win a prize . 
  you left out one minor detail though , sometimes the other guys shoot back . 
  the upcoming vote in greece ** can not ** cause greece to leave the european union . 
  the ** only ** way greece or any other state can leave the eu is by using the exit clause in the treaty of lisbon . 
  ( teu article 50 ) this involves the greek government notifying the european council of their intention to leave the union . 
  following this a withdrawal agreement ( which needs a qualified majority in the european council ) would have to be negotiated so the eu treaties could be ceased to be in operation , or failing a negotiated withdrawal agreement then at least 2 years would need to have elapsed since the official announcement of intention to leave the union before a member state can actually leave , using its own constitutional mechanism . 
  countries can not be just kicked out of the eu . 
  there is no legal basis for it ( no matter how much other member states might want this ) . 
  hell even if the greek army were to invade another eu member state they could n't be kicked from the eu because of it . 
  the legislation to do that simply does not exist . 
   i will now tell you a german joke . 
  a sausage maker buys a box of cereal . 
  i will now tell another joke . 
  knock knock . 
  who is there ? 
  a cannibal . 
  what ? 
  you are about to die and be eaten . 
  asshole !, 
  i will murder you first !, 
  precisely . 
  that was very precise , 2 decimal places . 
  also well above the normal melting temperature of an irish person . 
  money can be exchanged for goods and services . 
  $ 20 can buy many peanuts . 
   account deleted . 
  / u/this-is-not - my-fault has been called back by his division for an emergency meeting . 
   if i were to find out that my electronic warfare division was incompetent i would call for a meeting as well . 
  you have an electronic warfare division ?!? 
  where can i get one ? 
  you are assuming a lot . 
  $ 400 month rent . 
  $ 132 month transport . 
  living paycheck to paycheck any unexpected expense can screw you over for months . 
  thankfully i am slightly better off now . 
  also the cost of living is different in different countries . 
  stuff costs what it costs here you pay the going rate or do n't have it . 
  $ 400 month is cheap for renting in dublin , and its actually very hard to find a place to rent . 
  $ 132 is a monthly city bus ticket . 
  a lot of people have forgotten or never known what regular hunger actually is . 
  it exists still today in europe . 
  i have been hungry in my life . 
  i ca n't stand to see another human go hungry . 
  i physically ca n't stand it . 
  cost of living comparison between dublin and athens http://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/comparison/dublin/athens-greece look through the details in the link to get a better idea . 
  category | % cheaper in athens -- | -- food | 18 % housing | 52 % clothes | 12 % transportation | 53 % personal care | 26 % entertainment | 27 % total 40 % cheaper to live in athens , but here 's the thing 47 % less wages . 
  yeah there are differences in cost of living but when your weelky wage is a lot lower than your monthly mortgage/rent you are going to have financial trouble . 
  i do n't think you understand real life at all . 
  what we could do with is that purple `` grape '' flavor that tastes nothing like grapes but it is still pretty good . 
  we do n't get that here at all , or grape jelly . 
  we do have peanut butter though . 
  you could do with the chocolate . 
  european chocolate is glorious master chocolate compared to inferior american chocolate . 
  you think 70 % of people default on their mortgage for fun ? 
  it is almost always a decision between eating and homelessness . 
  $ 1004 per month or $ 251 per week is not a livable wage . 
  imagine a family on that . 
  even worse it is the average wage so , around half the people there are on less than that . 
  could n't agree more with / u/eternalobscurity . 
  average monthly wage in greece $ 1004 . 
  average monthly wage in ireland $ 2129 . 
  those are just numbers , in reality the situation in greece is destroying lives . 
  people are going hungry , people are going without healthcare and people are going mad . 
  * have you ever worried about having a roof over your head ? 
  * actually went hungry ? 
  * had to save for months to see a dentist ? 
  you have clearly never been in a situation like that . 
  if you had you would know that this is something you would n't wish on your worst enemy . 
  the greeks deserve a break . 
  things are not great here but i struggle to imagine what greece is like . 
  sincerely , go have intimate relations with a tree . 
  considering how the eu manages to use [ doublespeak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doublespeak ) in 24 languages , it is probably why they would not outline their [  concrete plan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkzbltqij6s ) in a pdf while negotiations are ongoing , i am sure they have one though , probably . 
  * edit : words . 
  hon hon hon, 
  til italians watch prawn instead of porn, 
  you are not an american and you are insulting an entire american nation . 
  what is your point ? 
  the majority of the rest of the world are not too pleased with the government of the russian federation , and based on recent events and common sense are suspicious of their motives . 
  sweden should be allowed join whatever international organisation they want , without threats from russia . 
  edit : words . 
   i can certainly understand that diplomacy and mutual understanding are completely foreign territory to a citizen of the warmongering empire , who need n't concern himself what the `` lessers '' and `` non-citizens '' outside his nations borders think . 
  pretty ironic really , because he is an american he ca n't have an opinion in / r/europe ? 
   where pretty much every single human being is raised with the ability to empathize and understand the viewpoint of the `` other '' , despite our complete and utter disapproval thereof . 
  um , yeah / u/forgotmypwasalways . . not the brightest peanut in the turd . 
  that 's the same with most people 's second or third languages , i would have much more more confidence with listening to or reading irish or spanish than trying to get the words out myself . 
  a few beers and i am told my language skills improve , fear of getting it wrong is the main obstacle . 
  the problem with people coming in by boat is 100 % caused by the eu . 
  on one hand we meet international obligations by accepting refugees by boat , we also put in place eu directives in place which expressly forbid airlines form carrying refugees into the eu if said airlines wish to operate in the eu . 
  a refugee could fly into europe for far cheaper legitimately from syria than pay several times the amount to human traffickers to get them on a dangerous boat . 
  the eu is passing the responsibility of refusing refugees onto the airlines and creating the situation where economic migrants are being mixed with genuine war refugees in syria and crossing in boats . 
  it 's almost as if they want to create a problem just to avoid solving other problems . 
   that would be an improvement on their current situation , at least they 'll eat . 
  the sad thing about that comment is he is right . 
  yep fully agree , if there was legal heroin in the morning how many would go and take up the habbit , very few , but the harm reduction for those already addicted would justify it . 
  also addicts are not going to steal and commit crime to feed their habit if it was legally available , less harm to society overall . 
  drug prohibition is only good for criminals who make money out of it . 
  yeah you can keep that too ... danm irish , they ruined ireland, 
  buckies swigged can mean about about the same ammout of trouble as shots fired :d,
