a brit telling porkies . 
  at least you ai n't fucking it . 
   what were you thinking over there ? 
  i answered this question but you 've completely spun what i said and come to a conclusion about me that is odd . 
  you must be a politician . 
  it 's not like he does much acting on behalf of his constituents his attendance and voting record is horrendously bad . 
  http://c0.thejournal.ie/media/2011/03/254943262-390x285.png the idiot pictured above is former property developer but is now a left wing independent politician who campaigns against austerity . 
  he 's a tax cheat who owes over $ 2 million in tax which he under declared during his time as a developer . 
  irish politics is a weird place sometimes . 
  the eu made turf cutting on some bogs illegal and the government here started enforcing the ban . 
  this angered a lot of rural people from the area ming is from . 
  ming is opposed to the ban on turf cutting . 
  most people consider him an idiot but he smokes weed so the internet thinks he is awesome . 
  he has a horrible attendance and one of the worst voting records as an mep . 
  ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/two-irish-meps-have-worst-voting-record-in-parliament-1.2037668 ) . 
  and an account on wikipedia `` lukeming '' was banned for `` this account has been blocked indefinitely because checkuser evidence confirms that the operator has abusively used multiple accounts . '', 
  and the account has a history of removing controversial content and editing luke mings wikipedia page . 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=luke_%27ming%27_flanagan&amp;offset=20140313162432&amp;action=history ), 
  reposting a repost ( http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/36nxcp/tpp_the_dirtiest_trade_deal_youve_never_heard_of/crfp7go )  all trade negotiations are in secret . 
  if the negotiations were public , corporations and nation states would try to use the media to shape the deal to their advantage . 
  it would be chaos . 
  once the text of the deal is finalized , it becomes public . 
  this occurs before the deal is voted on by congress , giving members of the public the opportunity to express their support for or opposition to the deal to their representatives before they vote on it . 
  tpp can not become law unless it is approved by congress in a vote that takes place well after the deal is finalized and made publicly available for anyone to read . 
   i know the tpp is unpopular on reddit . 
  maybe rightly so . 
  but do n't bash it for being secret : all trade negotiations , just like virtually all interstate negotiations ( like the ongoing iran deal ) , must be secret for there to be any hope of agreement . 
  in ireland if you do n't have a clue about politics or economics it is acceptable to just scapegoat `` bankers '' and blame them for pretty much everything wrong with the world . 
  politicians are elected here by campaigning on a platform similar to `` the bankers are out to get you '' and `` if it was n't for bankers we could all live like kings '', 
  the south area of the republic : pharmaceuticals , chemical manufacturing . 
  if we can veto we will veto . 
  france and germany vs the rest of europe more than likely, 
   this could be a turning point for gay rights world wide . 
  if it was n't for usa we would be the worlds best country for blowing our own trumpet . 
   gay-conversion `` therapy '' was very prevalent . 
  no it was n't . 
  who told you this ? 
  because they were lying . 
  no it was n't . 
  but this is reddit so the church must be bashed . 
  people were irish catholic yesterday , they are still irish catholic today . 
  there was no `` fuck you '' from the electorate . 
  it was about civic marriage equality . 
  yes . 
  without a doubt it will pass as long as people actually go out and vote . 
  the fear is young people wont vote . 
  seeing as ireland is the only country i know of that puts any european treaties to popular vote and rejects them before being made vote again . 
  i think `` the people want it '' is too big an assumption seeing as ireland would be one of the least euroskeptic countries in the eu, 
  nobody in europe cares about baltimore either . 
  its not that big of a story here . 
  now the london riots were huge a few years back here . 
  dublin riot a few years ago was all over our news similar to baltimore in the us, 
  $ 80 fine here no matter how far over the limit . 
  my only ticket is 83 in a 50km/h zone because i had no idea a speed camera van was allowed operate on the road so i was unlucky . 
  ive no idea how that would be treated on the continent . 
  and we have some of the safest roads in europe now . 
  plus no fixed speed cameras . 
  you can even see the map of the roads that the police target online http://www.garda.ie/gosafe.htm any attempt to link fines to income would create outrage here . 
  politicians only pass laws which they can claim are `` about safety , not revenue generation '' . 
  i prefer our system . 
  slightly off topic . . but is the new york post a a reputable newspaper because it doesnt seem to like whoever de blasio is at all seeing as all 3 of the column next to this story are articles bashing him ? 
  so who going to force us to set border controls with northern ireland ? 
  the eu army ? 
  tumblr, 
  tumblr, 
  because this crackdown is typical of all other coutries with freedom of speech . 
  but then again this is a country where insulting the national anthem is an offence and where joking about charlie hebdo nearly landed a comedian in jail . 
  no these arent facts these are opinions too i guess . 
  france is home to double standards when it comes to free expression . 
  regards . 
  not my opinion , it 's fact . 
  mocking islam is okay but a skinny model who choses so at her own volition is not okay . 
  well done france , freedom of expression only when it suits your egos . 
  bravo , thats not freedom of expression regards, 
  france seems to have a very weird relationship with freedom of expression . 
  tumblr, 
  yes . 
  all the cars breaking the law in that video are gypsies . 
  its in ireland so cars drive on the left ? 
  dont worry the travellers more than likely did shoot the horses and dump them in a river soon after, 
  they are travelers , more than likely dont have driving licences or insurance . 
  prosecute them for anything and they scream discrimination . 
  the speed limit on that road is 100km/h . 
  the average irish person hates them . 
  this made national news for days . 
  http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0208/366875-five-men-jailed-after-horse-race-on-main-road/ no joke their defense was `` it 's our tradition '', 
  the government over the past few decades has dramatically reduced the power of local government and centralised power to dublin . 
  now rural areas have to send tds to dublin to achieve what they could formerly achieve with the local councils . 
  the double irish loophole closed but we just opened a different loophole called the knowledge box . 
  it is weird knowing the country that hates irishness and irish culture is situated on the island on ireland . 
  although northern ireland is one of the poorest regions in the uk it s councils still finds money [ to fund tens of huge bonfires where they burn the republic of ireland flag and effigies of irish politicians every year .

  unlike the people of nireland being irish is n't a choice for me . 
  if your implying not being favour of reunification shows someone is n't irish then your going to have to to wake up to the fact 70 % of irish people are only in favour of unification if it meant zero tax hikes . 
  unconditional support for unification is a minority opinion . 
  sinn fein have to say that . 
  no matter what the outcome they will always push it . 
  the truth is n.ireland is a disaster but its a british disaster . 
  the current setup where the fine people of britian pick up the tab to fill the # 11 billion hole in the norths finances without ever being paid back without complaint every year is just grand with me . 
  big plus is we do n't have to waste time on sectarian nonsense down here such as in just the last week ...
