  he 's a dedicated anti-irish troll , do n't rise to him, 
  come on man , bit of spark . 
  that ai n't creative . 
  try harder . 
  no street view and lack of ** any ** free public wifi makes travelling in germany quite different to anywhere else ive been recently . 
  do n't realise how great they are until you lose them . 
  / u/citylondinus , / u/lordadicus and / u/wasppoker !, 
  welcome back , 
  so no more single market ? 
  not like we would have a choice would we if that 's how it was decided ? 
  we rejected the last two eu treaties we had to vote on and europe made us vote again . 
  the eu , a union based on free trade ca n't negotiate any free trade deals due to populist anti-globalism . 
  this is a serious problem for the project . 
  since 1922 we would be very upset if london started passing laws on our behalf . 
  you are correct . 
  if 1 region of a country can kill trade deals between the eu and non eu countries then the project is already dying . 
  no way is that sustainable, 
  there is nothing binding about the paris treaty . 
  when australians who clicked on this reddit page are finally able to load up this webpage tomorrow they are going to be pissed . 
  we were only neutral to show off our new found sovereignty and had the very nice position of being to the west the uk and not the east . 
  now we are neutral because we are nuzzled in between the uk and us and do n't want to spend any money and like to take the higher moral ground on war . 
  hi germany , any chance of a bit of ~ ~ free ~ ~ ** any ** public wifi now the next time i visit . 
  thanks babe : ' - ) i needed to hear that rite now xxx, 
  for all intents and purposes an irish citizen is viewed equally as a british citizen if living in the uk and a uk citizen is treated as an irish citizen if living in the republic of ireland . 
  it would be a shame to see it go . 
  hopefully there will be a way of maintaining it . 
  the free movement deal is called the common travel area and it 's why ireland never joined schegen as to maintain it . 
  i 'd say there are a lot of irish people hoping that even if the uk imposes eu immigration controls we can maintain these exemptions for each other . 
  i doubt most british people really care tbh . 
  with anarcho capitalist as a flair you 'd have an easier time explaining this to a monkey . 
  the essence of anarcho capitalism is poverty is good as long as it is n't you and business owners are making nice easy money . 
  they see a picture of a boot on the neck of a worker and dream one day of wearing that boot . 
   you 're like that guy , who does n't care about crime rates , but lives in a gated community ... im stealing this thanks . 
  sums up our position completely . 
  you are right , we as a nation are selfish and naive . 
  we live with the knowledge/hope that come a war we are tucked away with the uk being our buffer from trouble . 
  ww2 would have been alot different if we were to the east of the uk and not the west . 
  we should join nato . 
  when we say we are neutral we really mean we refuse to spend what is required to defend our own sovereignty . 
  if every european nation was like us europe would be screwed . 
  euroskepticism does n't mean we have to leave . 
  it means increased support for the current government 's position of resisting further european integration . 
  we must thank the gods that we refused to give up our veto on tax harmonisation in 2003 . 
  oh look ttip is dead ... yet again . 
  awh look / r/europe 's weekly `` ttip is dead '' article just on time . 
  citylondinus you got a new account . 
  welcome back !, 
  outlaw misleading and hyperbolic campaigning and leave it to our independent referendum commission who legally have to provide unbiased information . 
  referendums only work if people know what they are actually voting on . 
  for lisbon we had claims for example * $ 1.84 minimum wage imposed by the eu and diminished workers rights * yes vote would split up family farms and kill rural areas * the referendum represented ` a proxy referendum on turkish accession ' * created a backdoor for the eu to hike our taxes people were purposely mislead . 
  also worked great for the irish lisbon vote where the no side made up facts like '' $ 1.44 minimum wage vote no '' referendums focus on emotion not facts, 
  that did n't work for lisbon . 
  the no side was purposefully deceptive and lied to the public . 
  the politicians in favour then have to spend time counteracting these lies and explaining the treaty which makes them look disorganised and scattered . 
  thats how irish referendums seem to work with the exception of same sex marriage . 
  the deceptive and lying no side to any eu vote is bolstered by the anti government voters . 
  our current government is a minority right wing government supported by the largest opposition party who agreed not to vote against them in `` motions of no confidence '' which if they lost would mean the end of the current government . 
  so that turn out will be ** big ** during the lisbon vote the no side lied and claimed if we voted yes we would see a mandatory eu army and a $ 1.84 minimum wage ( our minimum wage was about $ 8 at the time ) . 
  and force us to adopt a liberal abortion laws against the irish peoples will ( http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/yourview/anti-lisbon-group-makes-false-claims-about-the-minimum-wage-and-workers-rights-100295.html ) these people are then countered by people who realize if they do n't vote yes the country is going to reject something that affects europe as a whole for bullshit reasons . 
  a ttip referendum would be no different . 
  i 've never been better . 
  how are you getting on ? 
  we are all real jealous of the great economy the british have developed in northern ireland . 
  net contributor since 2014 . http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/ireland-contributes-more-money-than-it-gets-to-eu-for-first-time-34815450.html, 
  those articles might have been a bit biased . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9052891/london-mayor-says-bonjour-to-banks-fleeing-french-tax.html http://www.euronews.com/2012/06/19/cameron-invites-over-taxed-french-bosses-to-blighty/ indeed . 
   even though she is the epitome of a career politician how ? 
  she only officially entered politics in 2001 . 
  15 years ago . 
  she 's nearly 70 if she is what do you describe sanders as ? 
  besides being the most partisan politician in the senate up there with ted cruz . 
  yet watch them scream when anyone suggests they may lose their eu privileges or there may be negatives for the uk when the eventually leave . 
  umm if the uk does n't get full access it will lose its financial passport to operate in other eu countries . 
  london will be divided up by the eu . 
  that 's not a question at this stage , it 's not scaremongering it 's simple the eu putting its self interest ahead of the u.k. you 'll notice we will start to do that ... a lot . 
  agriculture will get a shock but it will adjust , adapt and survive mainly due to our eu membership and a government that wo n't sit and let it sink . 
  but given that uk farmers will lose cap and the uk is a net importer of food . 
  prices will go up for all food products in the uk and i 'm pretty sure the citizens of the u.k will still need to eat . 
  ireland loses 0.2 % of its gdp per 1 % loss of the uk as a rule of thumb . 
  ireland is currently growing at a rate of 7.8 % while uk politicians accept a recession is on the horizon . 
  how much exactly are the uk planning on contracting ? 
  in the uk even the immigrants do n't like immigrants . 
  thank god the uk has no history of bullying small nations . 
  anyway happy 4th of july !, 
  that 's the whole point of the eu . 
  pretty pathetic if we did n't have more power and influence combined than the uk or switzerland have individually . 
  there 's actually a phrase in ireland that we are `` closer to boston than berlin '' . 
  ca n't really comment how true that is but it exists and is used in political discussions every now and again . 
  rubbish . 
  uk citizens will still be able to enjoy the full benefits ( as extremely limited as they are ) of the eu while being outside and electing nationalistic politicians who show nothing but disdain for the european project , boris johnson , michael gove and nigel farage promised . 
  not true ... sure it will hurt . 
  nothing compared to what the n.irish farmer will face such as the near complete dependence on republic processors for the dairy sector or the fact that 87 % of their income is comes in the form of eu cap money and that fact that the eu imposes a 40 % tariff of outside agricultural goods and the opening of british markets to cheap previously banned agrigoods like brazilian beef . 
  but im sure you know all about those threats and arent engaging in petty nationalism . 
  rip n.irelands agriculture . 
  yes its ridiculous . 
  what does leaving the eu mean to boris ? 
  just not hanging the eu flag on public buildings and not paying into the eu . 
  because thats not how any of this works . 
  at least they 'll be no need to redesign their car registration plates . 
  it went from a 0.1 % chance of happening in the next 10 years to a 1 % chance of happening so people who really want unity got excited .
