  you 're just spewing vitriol with no facts . 
  europe is n't a nationality ? 
  what country in europe ? 
  who else considers a blog post a credible source ? 
  it is not my opinion . 
  the reality is that you 're the only one passing opinions off as facts . 
  may i ask your nationality ? 
  my opinion that a blog post is not a credible source ? 
  or the ** fact ** that the pew survey does n't mention ** belarus ** once ? 
  i have n't seen any facts , you have n't provided them . 
  a blog post is not factual , and the survey provides no facts on ** belarus ** . 
  where are the facts though ? 
  you have n't presented them . 
  you presented a blog post , a survey which ** doesnt even mention belarus ** and an article that does n't substantiate your claims . 
  you 're digging yourself into quite a hole . 
  blind hatred is fascinating . 
  to the region in central albania , not in serbia , or macedonia, 
  you have n't presented any facts though, 
  1 is a blog post - irrelevant 1 does n't even mention belarus 1 just says that luka plays both sides, 
  it 's hilarious, 
  one is a blog post and one does n't even mention belarus do you have mental issues ? 
  yes , albania supporting the occupation of another country * how honourable * . 
  it 's not uncharacteristic though , albanians occupied and ethnically cleansed kosovo of its indigenous population so they would be hypocrites if they did n't support the zionists doing the same . 
  where in the texts ? 
  i would like you to show me because 1 is irrelevant as it is a blog post , 1 does n't mention ** belarus ** and one does n't say anything of the sort . 
  maybe if turkey did n't occupy kurdistan this would n't happen . 
  occupied people have a right to resist . 
  where in these articles is anything proven ? 
  are we talking about women ? 
  i thought we were talking about christians . 
  these links have n't proven anything to me . 
  one is a blog post , one is a pew study that does n't mention belarus , and one is an article that does n't mention anything about the feelings of belarusians toward russia . 
  please point out to me where in these links it is  proven belarus hates russia because i looked several times and ca n't find it . 
  kadyrov is kind of a badass though , i ca n't help but stand in awe of him . 
  have you seen his instagram lol ? 
  you have n't provided me with one link substantiating your claim - you provided me with a blog post , a pew study that did n't mention belarus , and an article that said that luka is playing a balancing act . 
  i 'm not denying anything , i just want more than your opinion . 
  i want facts . 
  so saudi arabia represents the entire arab world ? 
  okay , what evidence have you shown me ? 
  i keep asking for it but you are n't providing it . 
  just one link . 
  like lebanon where a christian holds the presidency ? 
  i 'm sure life under occupation is just great , [ being gassed by foreign soldiers ] ( http://www.alternet.org/world/santa-gets-tear-gassed-palestine-how-israel-suppresses-christmas-palestinians ) really gets the christmas cheer going . 
  i would like to see the obvious evidence that you have n't provided me . 
  please provide it . 
  just one piece of evidence . 
  i 'm * begging * for my mind to be liberated from the brainwashing . 
  i wonder what christmas is like for christians in bethlehem under occupation . 
  i 'm not asking for your help , i 'm asking for evidence - you have provided nothing but your own opinion . 
  i see that you have nothing concrete to offer me . 
  i 'm asking for one reputable source that confirms your claims about belarus . 
  why have n't you provided that ? 
  if your opinion is true that should n't be an issue . 
  there goes another country i wo n't visit now, 
  i 'm not denying anything . 
  i 'm looking for evidence , please provide that evidence . 
  thank you . 
  all i was asking is for you to back up your claims . 
  please back up your claims with regards to attitudes toward russia in the country called ** belarus ** and i will concede this argument . 
  so far , you have provided me with no evidence of anything in regards to the country called ** belarus ** and have resorted to childish whining . 
  i will ask you once more to substantiate the claims you made in regards to ** belarus ** . 
  if you provide me with sourced information that is sufficient i will concede this discussion , but you have not at this point . 
  so again , please provide evidence to your claims about ** belarus ** and not childish talks of `` buttpain '' . 
  just in case you do n't understand me , i 'm asking about ** belarus ** . 
  not china , not poland , not burkina faso , not chile but ** belarus ** . 
  do you understand ? 
  okay , great . 
  that 's not the purpose of my query but continue to deflect . 
  i was asking specifically about ** belarus ** . 
  do you have any information , on the country called ** belarus ** ? 
  belarus is n't even mentioned in that study ... 
  i would like proof of that statement - not `` luka is playing both sides '' but firm proof that the belarussians are uncomfortable with russian influence . 
  no , i do n't . 
  i keep asking for it . 
  that 's all i want . 
  is proof that the belarusian people are anti russia, 
  that 's still not an answer . 
  i would simply like proof of your statement . 
  if you think i 'm so ignorant , please enlighten me with evidence . 
  you have n't . 
  i 'm waiting . 
  that 's not an answer . 
  i do n't want to ignore the facts so please present those facts to me and change my pov , thanks, 
  you did n't , actually - i do n't care either way but i would like you to substantiate that the population of belarus does not like russia . 
  the burden of proof is on you . 
  all i want is back up of this statement  i can assure you that nobody in belarus wants to be a pawn of russia or have russia to invade them . 
  can you prove this statement ? 
  madrid looks like an amazing city , i 've only been to marbella and benidorm ( the anglo-irish riviera lol ) but i have always wanted to see more of spain . 
  amazing country . 
  turkish media has no bias at all lol were the hospitals being used as a rebel base ? 
  lots of scots in the central belt have irish roots too , some parts of glasgow ( calton comes to mind ) have gaa leagues , republican murals , tricolours flying next to saltires - it 's grand !, 
  that 's just an article about luka playing both sides not anti russian sentiment in belarus, 
  no , fascists in the baltics and in budapest 56 and and in prague 68 were a threat . 
  because they were threats to the state . 
  honestly the soviets did 3 things wrong : expelling germans from the east , glasnost and perestroika, 
  every thread someone says something dumb like this, 
  ridiculous propaganda lol, 
  i did n't know that so its not too common . 
  also , blogspot is not a source .
