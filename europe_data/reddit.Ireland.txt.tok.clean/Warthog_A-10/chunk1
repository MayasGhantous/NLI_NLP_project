and they lost . 
  ha ha ha you must be fucking joking . 
  the soviets were trying to annex finland like the baltic countries , or install a puppet government like they did to poland and they failed miserably . 
  the finnish troops humiliated an army much larger than theirs and in the end settled for peace with the soviets . 
  they lost territory , but they defended their country . 
   should n't be very proud of raping early soviets . 
  i 'm damn proud of finland for inflicting devastating losses on the soviet invaders that were trying to take over their country . 
  without their bravery the soviets would probably forced them into their shitty communist empire . 
   this finland vs soviets thing is as good as saying germans vs soviets . 
  by your logic soviets should be afraid of germans . 
  after all have you seen their k :d ratio ? 
  eh i was n't really using any logic , just posting a humorous picture that i saw sometime before here about finland 's impressive achievements in one war . 
  damn ninjas slicing onions in the background ... 
  agreed !, 
  yeah the poland one is a bit confusing . 
  are the polish in the uk typically younger and not requiring large healthcare costs maybe , but i imagine there are n't many older uk immigrants in poland like spain , so it is strange . 
  uncertain times ahead for everyone . 
  i wonder if irish citizens might be treated more favourably though as we both allow our expat citizens citizens to vote in the others general elections and our continuing history with northern ireland . 
  this is how you get new memes . 
  did they not see what happened when the harambe zoo asked for the memes to stop ... !, 
  yeah there 's plenty irish citizens living in northern ireland that view themselves simply as irish . 
  some people identify as british , and some as northern irish . 
  yeah plus there 's a lot of irish in the uk , northern ireland included ... * for now * , 
  i 'm guessing that is because the uk has a much higher older and retired population in eu countries , than the other way around . 
  pops law , easy to miss without the ' / s ', 
  [ finland ] ( http://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/3113351_460s.jpg ), 
  * for now ... *, 
  where he putting potatoe ? 
  there 's so damn much of it in europe to be fair though , it would be pretty hard to cover the other 90 % ... plus the push for independence was a pretty major part of irish history . 
  there 's more information available about more recent history so it 's easier to portray . 
  i will say though that i learned pretty much nothing about the eastern roman empire in school , even though it outlasted the western roman empire by centuries . 
  that should have been given more attention imo . 
  wow , this was nearly as annoying to listen to those brexit voters who were surprised with the result and regretted their vote . 
  well sticking to football , they just got their revenge with a sweet disallowed england goal at the world cup . 
  their `` revenge '' on the battlefield in ww2 was very bad for everyone involved , themselves included :(, 
  i 'm being optimistic  a small majority of 55.8 % voted against the brexit referendum in northern ireland . 
  if brexit has a very negative impact on northern ireland it * might * make reunification more popular there . 
  however in a recent survey on a hypothetical border poll 56.5 % would vote remain in the uk , and only 30.4 % would vote for to join the republic of ireland . 
  i do n't expect anything to happen in the near future , but in 10-20 years ... maybe !, 
  nice , ireland is pretty prominent in the bottom right of the cloud picture . 
  lol they will never shut up about that . 
  i 'm just glad germany got some revenge for the `` 1966 goal '' in the 2010 wc . 
  people like dividing too . 
  czech republic & slovakia , ireland & uk etc. 
  well when the majority of the people living there vote for it we will , 
   in the spirit of european friendship , i just added you as a friend . 
  euro friends unite !, 
   this awake cycle . 
  never heard this one before , interesting , 
  good riddance , do n't let the door hit you on the way out !, 
  plus there are plans to remove them in the near future . 
  * do n't mention the war !, 
  * lol, 
  yeah the burmese ambassador killing his wife and doing a funeral pyre in plain sight is pretty shocking . 
  that 's true , but they are committing crimes at will , without consequence , which is what your comment was about . 
  in serious cases their country can waive their immunity , but it has been used in cases of murder before , without consequence . 
  afraid not , this kind of disgusting behaviour is so common place it 's not very `` onioney '' imo . 
  a lot of times that 's exactly what it does mean . 
  and ireland ( sunburn deaths ) ... but we did n't vote for brexit :(, 
  ireland can carry the can for them , we can balance the elements of talkative/depression , between sunny/northern europe !, 
  good to know for future reference !, 
  well time to renew that fine tradition , * erin go bragh !, 
  * edit : ps ironically the term gringo originally applied to the irish in spain  https://np.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/53tb70/til_the_derogatory_term_gringo_originated_in/, 
  which is the `` best '' saxony ? 
  ( from your flair ), 
  i second this motion !, 
  yeah i ca n't see them doing well at the esc anytime soon with their brexit vote . 
  they need to be accepted into the eurovision song contest first like australia , as is tradition . 
  ah yes the road signs , include the place names in english and in irish , like this : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/road_sign_on_the_r639_north_of_urlingford%2c_ireland_-_20090502.jpg and the airport signs use [ both languages . 
  ] ( http://www.languagediscount.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/dublin-airport-resized-600.png ), 
  * almost * genius idea , 
   well this is a doddle . 
  = well this is easy = well this is n't difficult, 
   well this is a doddle . 
  = well this is easy = well this is n't difficult, 
  i do n't understand sorry . 
  ah ok , i was very confused lol . 
  apt choice of video to represent this thread so !, 
  google translate will think it 's being hit with a ddos from europe today !, 
  probably silly question , but i do n't get the video ... why did they change from being disgusted with him the first time to being flirty with him the second time ? 
   well this is a doddle . 
  = well this is easy = well this is n't difficult, 
  while you 're right that irish is the `` first '' official language of ireland and it takes precedence in the constitution , english is the second official language recognised in the constitution , so it is an official language under the constitution also . 
  so irish is n't the official language of the republic , well not the only one anyway . 
  being realistic there is only a tiny minority in the country that actually use the language regularly . 
  true i guess . . 
   but why would they when we 're so busy finding loopholes for them ? 
  i think it 's their accountants and highly paid advisers that find the loopholes for them , not ireland . 
   in what way is he a hypocrite ? 
  he was very open about what he was doing and ukip meps have a very high turnout rate to vote against expansion of eu powers ( real or perceived ) . 
  well he 's taking a salary from an organisation he does n't believe should exist . 
  maybe hypocrite is the wrong word , because they want to ridicule the eu from the inside , and we 're elected . 
  they do not have a high turnout voting rate though !!!, 
  [ ukip meps attend the fewest european parliament votes of any party in the eu 's 28 countries ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ukip-meps-attend-the-fewest-european-parliament-votes-of-any-party-in-the-eus-28-countries-10316962.html ), 
  wow that hypocrite pos is still an mep ... 
  that 's because ireland annexed northern ireland this morning  edit : it was actually 1801 , when ireland was formally incorporated into the united kingdom . 
  it reminds me of the hbo miniseries band of brothers . 
  i really hope they get a prison term for their selfish actions . 
  wow , that 's pretty impressive considering there are still some issues with dissidents , and conflict over flags , marches etc. 
  well law of unintended consequences , his writings did indirectly lead to the crimes of stalin , even if he never intended so .
