  better late than never ... 
  i love the fact that that there 's a `` guns drawn '' statistic . 
  drawing a gun/tazer seems to be the default setting in a lot of usa police interactions , even where pretty innocuous . 
  hence the throwaway account ... 
  imagine if someone doxed this opinion !, 
  good call , 
  that is some weird logic !, 
   the number of stars on the flag is fixed at 12 , and is not related to the number of member states of the eu ( although the eu did have 12 member states from 1986 to 1994 ) . 
  this is because it originally was the flag of the council of europe . 
  in 1953 , the council of europe had 15 members ; it was proposed that the future flag should have one star for each member , and would not change based on future members . 
  west germany objected to this as one of the members was the disputed area of saarland , and to have its own star would imply sovereignty for the region . 
  twelve was eventually adopted as a number with no political connotations and as a symbol of unity . 
  good find , my curiosity was itching there , finally satisfied , 
  ... hypocrisy at it 's finest . 
   [ `` give me some spare clips '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqgsvypxgoo ), 
  found the butthurt american . 
  they even ruined the `` perfect '' season . 
  what a bunch of pricks !, 
  that one guy had the permits in for the parade and all . 
  fuck the browns !, 
   and pkk would be changed from `` terrorists '' to `` freedom fighters '' just like kla ... ... and george washington . 
  but there 's no explanation of the regions there . 
  why are they grouped that way ? 
  tbf there 's a solid ~ [ 7km border ] ( https://www.google.ie/maps/dir/54.48293,-8.2767776/54.4645686,-8.1780973/@54.4940542,-8.2595256,11.74z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e2 ) with the rest of the republic of ireland . 
  lol now i * really * like him , 
  so cruel to take this one netherlands victory away from them , 
  they 're too busy with vodka to notice the buffet . 
  `` more german than the germans themselves '', 
  good practice for making foxholes later in life , 
  ... hold on a minute , i need to get the car battery . 
  pharmaceuticals from the cork area are a big export item too . 
   keeptalkinggreece.com  but this happened also to all great empires of the past seems like a worthy source of information / s, 
  it 's like how germany are england 's big football nemesis , but to germany , england is just another country , the netherlands is the real nemesis !, 
  why i thought czechia was the new preferred name . 
  the greatest enemy one is a masterpiece . 
  best clay in northern ireland so . 
  biological/chemical warfare :o, 
  it 's a really nice logo . 
  if it ai n't broke do n't fix it . 
  not for ireland :(, 
  yes it is offensive to kebabs of all shades of meat :(, 
  they picked a big number . 
  800 years ... , 
  what 's the syringe in the third panel about ? 
  nah , they never got to ireland so they did n't even do that for us !, 
  it 's a shame his replacement is even worse . 
  imagine the turkish response if this happened to their consulate/embassy in the netherlands ... 
  oh you 're right , i did n't even notice that , and of course they took the harp image directly from the uk coat of arms , two panels up :(, 
  cool , til . 
  i 'm guessing the harp second from bottom on the left is ireland ? 
  what country is the three crowns below it representing ? 
  coincidentally it is very similar to a flag that represents munster , one of the provinces of ireland . 
  usually when they are on `` holidays '' in neighbouring countries . 
  catholic , west of scotland . 
  * probably * safe to say they have some irish immigrant ancestry !, 
  at least the threat of `` rome rule '' is long gone , the catholic church has little say in our country now !, 
  yeah that one really baffles me . 
  unless macedonia were seriously trying to claim territory in modern greece they should chill the fuck out . 
  it 's just a damn name of a different country . 
  the fyrom name `` compromise '' is beyond stupid . 
  yeah that 's fair enough . 
  yeah , personally i just use ireland when talking generally . 
  if i need to distinguish from northern ireland / island of ireland i can use republic of ireland . 
  i mean france is officially `` the french republic '' , but no-one uses that when talking generally . 
  may i ask why you 're against this solution ? 
  it seems like a reasonable proposal to the alternative of being isolated outside the eu . 
  well the majority of the people living there wanted to remain part of the uk . 
  it 's just a shame the british unionists used their majority in the new mini state , carved out of ireland , to discriminate against the irish nationalist minority living there for decades . 
  since the peace process in 1998 things have improved dramatically though thankfully !, 
  i think the rest of the uk would give up on it very quickly . 
  only a majority of the people in northern ireland would have to `` give up on it '' . 
  well in ireland too , but at current opinion poll levels there is already majority support here . 
  well i 'll have to agree to disagree with you . 
  if australia can enter the eurovision , why not ... !!!, 
  i quite like suriname . 
  i will claim bir tawil as my country once i * deal * with that dad who [ `` claimed '' ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/03/welcome-to-the-land-that-no-country-wants-bir-tawil ) it to make his daughter a `` princess '' . 
  they will rue the day they stood in my way !, 
  not this shit again . 
  in normal usage when we talk about `` countries '' we normally refer to sovereign independent countries with widespread recognition from many other sovereign independent countries . 
  well if 50 % plus vote for reunification there and here the peoples ' wishes should be respected imo , despite difficulties with some hardline unionists . 
  it would be totally unfair to require a larger majority , as the simple majority has been enough to ensure it has remained part of the uk until now . 
  yeah it was shitty how partition occurred . 
  i think 3 of the 6 northern ireland counties had majority nationalist populations but were still included , but they excluded the 3 additional counties in ulster from northern ireland , because the unionists would n't have retained their slim majority to dominate the statelet . 
  yeah it was * especially * bad in the last uk election . 
  the conservatives only got 37 % of the public votes , but got 51 % of the seats in parliament , so effectively 100 % control over the government . 
  vat is crazy complicated and hard to follow in every country though , not just germany . 
  asking to repay debt after repeated bailouts and delayed terms is `` punishing '' greece ? 
  the last time it looked like there would be budget surpluses in ireland the government increased spending wildly and cut income taxes :( thanks for setting up the perfect conditions for the debilitating 2008 crash fianna fail !, 
  they ignored their responsibilities with the ukraine agreement by annexing crimea . 
  i think they can shove this agreement up their hole if they think they 're entitled to a say in this matter !, 
  spell it `` phonetically '' if possible ? 
  i wish he won :(, 
  this is going to make the 30 years war seem like a pillow fight :(, 
  yeah :(, 
  but why :( nuclear power is a very safe and useful power source, 
  yay we can join our polish bros in this as well , along with the whole historically catholic thing , 
  [ beethoven ode to joy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wod-mudlnpa ) fuck yeah !, 
  well you could at least setup that subreddit before you 're going to whine about it ... 
  yeah they 're the actions of a wannabe bully playing the victim . 
  they 're the ones that invaded ukraine and ignored borders and previous agreements that they were party to .
