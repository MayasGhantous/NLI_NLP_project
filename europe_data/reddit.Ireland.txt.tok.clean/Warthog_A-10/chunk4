  that is probably more to do with the much greater amount of large cities and towns in spain , whereas ireland only has one large city . 
  in ireland rural areas there are a lot of people who live outside of towns due to relatively small farms historically . 
  based on the map it looks like ireland has more of a spread of people in rural areas than spain . 
  yeah ireland looks more `` densely '' populated . 
  it looks like pretty much everyone in spain must live in the cities and large towns . 
  probably [ ice cube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4uqmylds7q ) in his mind . 
   [ wake up scheeple.xkcd ] ( https://xkcd.com/1013/ ), 
  this would be very reassuring . 
  lol good riddance boris , enjoy life outside the single market . 
  i 'm glad portugal and ireland seem to be moving away from the piigs group . 
  now this is a first for me , * both * . 
  bravo !,

   thatcher in the thumbnail ... yeah there were a lot bigger cracks in british-irish relations then !, 
  shove that thorny stick up your ass . 
  i blame the government for not streamlining the process to deport spoofer economic migrants after a failed application . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptfmay6m6aa lol it was a british creation . 
  you tried that in 1919 onwards . 
  it did n't work out well for you , cunt . 
  well your flair indicates they got a good target , 
  i 'm sure you include george washington and oliver cromwell in that . 
  ... or washington and his merry band of patriots . 
  so much for our `` gallant allies '' ... 
  oh fuck off you scot . 
  your ancestors are still in northern ireland . 
  silly to admit at this stage imo ... 
  r/ireland should listen to this . 
  these spoofers can appeal for up to a decade here , and then they have the gall to complain about their accommodation despite refusing to accept their failed application . 
  hopefully it will take it 's toll on that trump gobshite . 
  i think he 's been a bit overwhelmed by actually being president entails already . 
  fuck that the fry grandad is a lot more representative than that communist sympathiser . 
  there 's a pretty long list . 
  woosh on my part so , 
  it 's typical in ireland too :( thanks uk / s, 
  \\* trunk of the car for americans, 
  immediately , even if he was armed with a butter knife . 
  it 's worse , there is this case where it looks like a cop lost his job for *** not *** shooting someone : https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/05/16/west-virginia-cop-fired-for-not-shooting-armed-black-man-lawsuit-says.html, 
  the truth will set you free . 
  [ * clever girl * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to5wryddei0 ), 
  that 's cool too . 
  i think it 's delightful , 
  he 's like palpatine , playing both sides of the conflict and profiting whatever the result . 
  * why * is he so anti-eu though ... ? 
  does it just make good press to sell newspapers ? 
  any poles want to explain the basic difference between these two ? 
  the brits had a tank on abbey street in dublin city centre , wtf !? 
  i did n't know this before today . 
  what was the worst genocide since then ? 
  * exactly * they ruined our country . 
  before those romans invaded britania we had a nice thing going . 
  no child abuse and no tan cunts from england invading ( properly before the normans arrived ) . 
  it 's all the romans fault for giving them expansionist ideas . 
   they ~ ~ created ~ ~ * destroyed * your religion , and your alphabet . 
  ftfy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/celtic_polytheism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ogham, 
  in ireland ( hibernia ) literally * nothing * , so they can go fuck themselves !, 
  i thought it was so retarded of her to call an election when she already had the majority from the last time . 
  in the 2015 election they got 51 % of the seats with only 37 % of the vote . 
  there was n't a hope of improving on that ratio as it was the most imbalanced election ever for seats/votes . 
  there is nowhere near a solid majority in favour of her `` vision '' for brexit , so there was always going to be a real risk of losing seats . 
  in this election they got 49 % of the seats , but they actually got an increased 42 % of the vote . 
  fptp for a voting system is beyond a fucking joke . 
  the last 2 are pretty questionable . 
  trident is pretty important . 
  austerity is criticised but the loss of aaa rating is also listed . 
  if labour were in power the rating would have fallen much lower due to mounting government debt ... 
  fair enough . 
  i 'd disagree to an extent , but there are some irish that overrate our successes as a country . 
   i used to live in ireland . 
  you guys are really good at talking yourselves up . 
  i would say to the point of delusion . 
  you believe you have a world class health system , welfare system , workers rights , economy , quality of life , everything . 
  are you sure you were in ireland ? 
  most of the people i know complain about those exact things regularly in ireland , while i see them as generally pretty good for a country our size . 
  fair enough other nordic countries etc are much better in areas , but ireland is doing ok . 
  well you are the one being `` touchy '' . 
  fair enough it is `` imprecisely '' worded , but i 'm pretty sure the vast majority of readers could glean from context the meaning behind those words . 
  lol good luck being competitive with trade tariffs between you and the rest of the eu . 
  tbf any reasonable person reading that sentence would know they meant proportionally . 
  we have a population under 5 million , we obviously do n't spend more in absolute terms than germany with a population over 80 million . 
  no problem , his `` accent '' is pretty strong tbf . 
  i think he was just acting `` hard '' to impress his `` friends '' on facebook . 
  i 'm not sure what happened after this but he deserved whatever he got . 
  he was repeatedly calling a guy `` baldy '' trying to get a reaction out of him , he called a guy a `` fucking asshole '' because he did n't say hello to this gobshite 's `` viewers '' , he was shouting out '' $ 5 blowjobs '' in the middle of the street , he pretended to steal a womans purse , he called a women a fat bitch , etc etc. 
  he was being a rude obnoxious shit to most people in the video and i 'm glad he got some payback as most people simply ignored him rather than deal with the little nacker 's bullshit . 
  no he was being rude and insulting to lots of people . 
  he is a vile little shit and got what he deserved . 
  i hope it does , in the full video this little shit was acting `` hard '' and insulting multiple strangers on the street until he met someone who was n't willing to put up with his shit . 
  yeah that 's true tbf . 
  but if leaving the uk meant tarrifs on trade with the uk the economy could be seriously wrecked . 
  there is already large concerns in ireland due to the large share of trade with the uk . 
  for a pre-independence scotland that share of the trade would be even greater proportionally i would imagine . 
  surely trade with england is much more important than trade with other eu countries ? 
  with the uncertainty around brexit i really struggle to see a majority actually voting from independence from the uk . 
  do regular people get postal votes in the uk ? 
  in some usa states i know they do . 
  no you 're right , they 've been living there for centuries now so it 's their home along with the irish living there . 
  i just wish they were n't such a bunch of cunts through the centuries . 
  if they had responded to the civil rights movement more appropriately i really believe the worst of the troubles could have been avoided . 
  * ** this may be a naive opinion *, 
  you beautiful genius ,
