  plenty of black african immigrants in europe who are christian . 
  what percentage of them ( and what percentage of their children ) are fundamentalist ? 
  unfortunately , too many people see racism as racial prejudice by whites against non-whites . 
  somehow these people fail to see the out-group hostility or prejudice from members of ethnic minority as prejudice or racism . 
  the goldsmith university student officer who tweeted #killallwhitemen expressed the exact same thing when she said : `` as an ethnic minority woman i ca n't be racist . '', 
  i will read the article in its entirety but i have to wonder what kind of results you would get if you compared muslims with an immigrant background with christians of an immigrant background . 
  many of those christian immigrants are likely to encounter the same racial or socio-economic barriers that are supposedly causing muslims to turn to fundamentalism . 
  do immigrant christians have the same degree of out group hostility towards their host country and religious fundamentalism ? 
  ** edit : ** it 'd also be interesting to see more info on the degree of dependence on social welfare by immigrant background . 
  i suspect that there are big differences between them . 
  another example , france had strong ties with a genocidal regime in rwanda . 
  do tutsis or even rwandans in europe harbour the same kind of extreme out group hostility/prejudice towards france ( or french people ) that we get from muslim groups in europe ? 
   the police refused to intervene when warned that her son was about to depart for istanbul , she said . 
  for god 's sake !, 
  totally agree . 
  yes , i do . 
  however , if you google it you can find al-qadri 's words have been picked up by a lot more reputable outlets . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.irishexaminer.com/viewpoints/analysis/islamic-state-terrorism-radicalisation-and-fighters-returning-to-ireland-are-our-biggest-threat-366201.html ) the examiner for one :  `` there are sympathisers or supporters of isis here , '' said shaykh umar al-qadri of the al-mustafa islamic centre in blanchardstown , west dublin . 
  `` you hear them saying they can understand why isis is doing this , they are standing up to the us . '' though small in number , he said it was `` very dangerous '' if they went unchallenged . 
  i know that . 
  we do have people from here who have travelled to syria though and [ others who sympathise with isis . 
  ] ( http://www.sundayworld.com/news/government-is-ignoring-isis-recruitment-in-ireland-says-muslim-cleric ) i am quite concerned about that . 
  part of me agrees with what you are saying . 
  but on the other hand , this ideology is spreading among people who have grown up in europe/america and are thousands of miles removed from the middle east . 
  many of these people associate more with fellow members of their own faith than with their own countrymen . 
  it 's not all a result of the countries they grow up in being at war in the middle east either . 
  my country has effectively been neutral ( although not at all hostile towards nato and the usa ) since before wwii . 
  yet we still have people growing up here [ joining militant groups in syria and isis sympathisers ] ( http://www.sundayworld.com/news/government-is-ignoring-isis-recruitment-in-ireland-says-muslim-cleric ) here . 
  it means i miss a time when we did n't have this threat of violence on a recurring basis in europe , of people not only out to destroy our states but also to kill as many of us as they can . 
  what have we done to the europe that we used to know ? 
  edit : my thoughts are with the victims . 
  i think the fact that these people turn on the police or have sympathy for people actively trying to destroy the state in which they live is very worrying . 
  for those who do that , i think it 's fair to say that they have failed to integrate and that they do not associate with the country they grew up in . 
  apparently it has happened enough times that there is even a [ name for it . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_syndrome ), 
  there you have one of the cultural reasons why immigrants from different parts of the world integrate better/worse . 
  what is it that is causing all these problems with somalis integrating in europe ? 
  out of curiosity , is the turkish government more concerned about the pkk or isis ? 
  source for that ? 
  the guardian would happily criticise saudi arabia on women 's rights and religious freedoms ( plenty of articles on the blogger raid badawi on there ) . 
  i suspect their intent is to criticise western foreign policy but at least they are right to criticise it . 
  but there are also enormous double standards at the guardian too because they 'd rather talk about something else when the exact same religious intolerance or mysogynist views come up amongst ethnic minorities in the uk . 
  i 'm surprised the echr has n't ruled that it 's against these people 's rights to stop them from going to live under sharia law . 
  i live in catalonia and see stuff pro-independence groups ( normally left wing groups like the cup and jerc ) about repression and even occupation , eg . 
  * catalonia has been denied the chance to hold a referendum on independence but it is not occupied like the west bank or other countries are . 
  that 's a big difference . 
  it is a country as much as scotland is . 
  edit : i mean by this that the user above has a right to post about catalonia as much as a scot does . 
  with all due respect to the user above , it is a nationalist take on catalonia 's history and some of the terms he/she used are a bit much , e.g. 
  `` took away ** our ** liberties and rights . '', 
  my country was conquered and repressed but to use the same terms to describe that and the growth in independence would be seen as strong here . 
  maybe it 's a cultural thing . 
  for the record , erc and other nationalist parties claim that the fiscal deficit for catalonia is the highest in the world . 
  [ in comparison with us states , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_taxation_and_spending_by_state#tables_of_federal_taxation_and_spending_by_state ) it most definitely is not ( with some states having a deficit of 12-20 % of their respective gdp ) . 
  however , i should add that the united states is a federal system and spain is n't . 
  is [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/iyzm4wx ) just an example of catalan humour then ? 
  populism at work , maybe ? 
  but who would have thought that an anti-capitalist , eurosceptic party that wants power to be held at municipal level would be populist . 
  it is the youth wing of erc so it 's not all that different . 
  i see actions of the youth wing brought up in conversations about other parties a lot ( people often bring up [ posters of the youth wing of the fn ] ( http://craigwilly.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fn-tu-niques-la-france.jpg ) in france when talking about the party ) . 
  many countries that ruled the world have little to show for it today ( portugal , holland , france and britain come to mind ) or owe their prosperity of today to trade . 
  spanish nationalists would probably point to cultural things from the * siglo de oro . 
  * i 'll take about the merits of being a small country another time . 
  i 'm looking forward to junqueras and mas having to say , `` i know i said spain was stealing from us '' and that everything would change with independence , but we have to follow austerity like before . '', 
  that will be particularly gratifying to the erc supporters ( many of whom are active here ) who make it seem that every single problem of catalonia is because of spain . 
  there is propaganda from both sides of the divide in catalonia . 
  were n't you the guy who said `` there 's no hatred towards spain in catalonia '' ? 
  i 've seen [ the stuff erc comes out with ] ( http://static.flickr.com/91/264338240_31e5027496_m.jpg ) and if [ insulting a country with such caricatures ] ( http://cdn.20m.es/img/2008/10/24/885825.jpg ) is n't hate , i do n't know what is . 
  but i 'm not going to say that hatred towards spain is what is driving independence as the spanish right does . 
  the actions of the pp have done more for the cause of catalan independence than parties like erc insulting spain . 
  what would be refreshing though is for the catalan nationalists to recognise this or for it to get as much prominence on tv3 as `` catalanofobia . '', 
  do you support the right of states ( or nations ) within the us to have a vote on independence if the majority or even a plurality are in favour of it ? 
  if you are , i commend you for your consistency . 
  if you are n't , i have to say your view seems awfully hypocritical . 
  ** edit : ** i am assuming you are from the united states as that is your flair . 
  yeah , the link above is n't working for me . 
  i agreed you had the right to decide , did n't i ? 
  but i also asked why you brought that up when it did n't have anything to do with the conversation and the user above was saying something quite insulting to spaniards . 
  i find it interesting that you bring up a point that has nothing to do with the conversation above , including the comparison of catalans with second class citizens and spain with serbia in the 1990s . 
  i support the right to decide . 
  i personally think the spanish government 's denial of a referendum on the issue is seriously undemocratic . 
  ** but ** i have seen the sentiments expressed by the user above many times here recently by catalan nationalists . 
  i think the second-class citizen comparison ( along with serbia ) is too far and the user above has a right to object . 
  there is a difference between not having your voice heard ( politically ) and being treated as second-class citizens . 
  anybody who believes catalans are should ask themselves whether they are actively discriminated in work , public services and political representation because they are catalans . 
  because that is the case with regards second-class citizens , as in the catholic minority in northern ireland or the blacks in southern united states until the 1960s . 
  i agree that the pp has done more for the independence movement than the pro-independence parties . 
  journalists like jordi evole and parties like the psc have used those exact words . 
  mind you , erc comes across as a party so confrontational in its desire to achieve its objective of getting catalonia out of spain ( a bit like ukip getting the uk out of the eu ) that i find it hard to take it seriously . 
  this is the party that claims catalonia has the biggest fiscal deficit in the world ffs . 
  a quick google search will show you that [ its not the case ] ( http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2015/02/13/2118963/euro-area-divergence-more-about-regions-than-countries/ ) and that us states have actually a [ much bigger deficit . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_taxation_and_spending_by_state#tables_of_federal_taxation_and_spending_by_state ) . 
  but hey , making the fiscal deficit sound like theft ( `` espanya ens roba '' ) makes independence sound like the better option . 
  but that said , i support catalans right to decide and fiscal autonomy . 
  i just do n't like parties twisting the reality of the situation to suit their narrative . 
  refugees in greece refuse to relocate across eu duncan robinson in brussels and kerin hope in athens one in seven asylum seekers in the eu 's flagship scheme to relocate refugees throughout the bloc has either refused to be moved or `` absconded '' , according to figures provided by the greek government . 
  the policy , agreed last year after considerable acrimony , was designed to spread more evenly the eu 's refugee burden by relocating 160,000 asylum seekers from frontline states greece and italy to other members of the bloc . 
  but it is being challenged by many asylum seekers ' refusal to go to poorer member states , such as bulgaria and romania . 
  of the 1,324 people processed as part of the relocation scheme so far , 191 have dropped out or simply disappeared , say greek officials . 
  as of last week , bulgaria had agreed to accept 47 asylum seekers from greece . 
  but when they were told they were being sent there , 36 withdrew from the programme while another seven `` absconded '' , according to the greek government .
