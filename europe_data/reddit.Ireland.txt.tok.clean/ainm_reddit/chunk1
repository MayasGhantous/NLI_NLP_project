as rule , hardliners generally require a certain amount of instability to drive their ideals through . 
  isis would prefer a boogeyman to unite hitherto unmotivated followers of islam to rally around their flag . 
  this is like the catholic church passing abusive priests from parish to parish . 
  most of the `` moors '' were actually arabanised iberians . 
  the same process by which egypt was turned into an arab country . 
  is are not going to stop provoking the european population until either they lash out or the socioeconomic situation that sustains them dies out . 
  the same tactics were used in iraq against the shia to produce a sectarian environment in which is could thrive . 
  as a matter of fact , is might even get more aggressive and more frequent in attacks if they feel the current level of terror is not working . 
  yes , a soccer club , and thus anyone high ranking there probably is a reasonable barometer of local opinion , or at least some of it . 
  just what is my narrative ? 
  it would be downright stupid for an irishperson to start recklessly indulging in orientalist rhetoric in light of all the persecution we went through in the past . 
  and an excutive is a fairly high ranking person in any case . 
   on saturday , the day after the coup attempt , veysel taskin , an executive with the trabzonspor soccer club , tweeted : `` the properties and the wives of the infidel coup-plotting bastards are spoils of war . '', 
  reading is * haram * it seems . 
  it 's special pleading , and does n't entirely address your point. , but if i adjust my comment to include things like navigable rivers that promote commerce and exchange of ideas , then most of germany is within 200 km of a `` coast '' . 
  prussia built railways to connect these regions together , promoting even more interchange between the different river systems . 
  in ireland , the church formerly had a lot of power in rural regions . 
  i think that 's true of almost anywhere - coastal regions tend to be more cosmopolitan than the interior . 
  give the security apparatus free reign to disappear anyone who could cause trouble like algeria during the civil war . 
  looks like the kurds will be happy at least . 
  we used similar tactics ( without the gruesome murder ) against the british , and we consider ( ed ) it a just war . 
  but i do think there was no choice , that the ira were the good guys , that the british were the bad guys , the northern orange state was/is an abomination and that o'donovan rossa was a hero . 
  notwithstanding the fact war is ugly . 
  i 'm just being honest about the cost , in the context of a discussion on why ireland has a tendency towards bending the constitutional rules and general cronyism .

  i was pointing out that because of the way independence was achieved , having to fight a guerilla/intelligence war instead of the british peacefully leaving , the country ended up with governance issues . 
  this is actually not uncommon when former colonies gained independence , look at say algeria . 
  i *** never *** said we should feel guilty about it , or that we would have been better off with the british in charge . 
  as far as i am concerned , the british bear the guilt for trying to wipe us out . 
  would you elaborate please ? 
  i might have been excessively clinical , but that does n't mean i 'm incorrect . 
  you do know the `` old ira '' were just as ruthless as the provos ? 
  how do you think mick collins stopped people from squealing to the british ? 
  in general , building a parallel state by means of violence is a bona fide example of an unconstitutional order , even though it was justified at the time it arguably lay at the root of the country 's governance problems going forward , notwithstanding the fact that the country already had governance problems under the british . 
  of breaking the rules when necessary , the irish republic began life as an * unrechtsstaat * built on intimidation and killing , and still has that heritage to this day . 
  many of ireland 's political problems , and many of its strengths both stem from the fact it was founded by what essentially were warlords , killers , and ultranationalists , albeit ones with a strong commitment to democracy , a preference for human rights , and a huge mandate from the people to pursue independence by force if necessary . 
  ireland has a bit of a history . 
  it 's not a surprise when marine le pen says things like this , true or not . 
  it is very unusual when a left wing party that gets most of the islamic vote does however - at the very least the ps are under intense pressure . 
  the real significance arguably lies in the fact that its the parti socialiste that 's saying it . 
  as i said elsewhere ireland did similar during the civil war . 
  ireland did it during the civil war in 1922 . 
  the publicity encourages copycats . 
  i do n't get you , are you referring to `` english are colonial oppressors '' , or `` nats are nazis '' ? 
  irish people have had historical problems with propoganda intended to make us look bad , so this does n't surprise me somehow . 
  a [ modern example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhfgqolsrtq ) which underscores your point . 
  edit : read the comments . 
  it is n't , which is why i included it with tatarstan to refute his point . 
  as / u/2a1za remarked , erdogan openly thinks that there was a mosque in cuba before columbus , and accordingly , the americas are under infidel occupation . 
  albania ? 
  i would imagine that wanting join the eu and wanting to behead people are inversely correlated . 
  `` nice : intended as an assault on us all '', 
  from the context , we were speaking of 1914 with the larne gunrunning . 
  the angl irish war lasted 3 years, 
  you have n't followed my advice . 
  then why is n't ireland part of britain ? 
  seriously , read your history . 
  no , there was only the uvf and the british army , the republicans were extremely weak at this point . 
  can you read ? 
  are you really pushing the line that the british were benevolent referees ? 
  you are aware that most irish people do n't want share a country with you ? 
   18 years ago ... 
  if you took the time to skim through wikipedia , you would have noticed that it is not unprecedented for there to be ~ 50 years of calm before another outbreak of war . 
  we heard of similar behaviour in bangladesh during the restraint siege . 
  shsshhh , you 're spoiling the circlejerk . 
  it 's all about islam , past oppression does n't make any difference at all whatsoever . 
  these people do n't want to hear about how christian ireland is just as bloodthirsty as all of the muslim countries in europe/eurasia , if not more so , with the obvious exception of chechnya . 
  even then , most of the difference can be explained by the fact that one country is northern europe with countries like iceland , and the other is away in the cascusus . 
  i mean we even have our own little cult of death and martyrdom ( `` our fenian dead ... '' , `` remember the hunger strikers ... '' ) . 
  we invented leaderless jihad with the phoenix park killings . 
  remember that exiled hero ours president honoured ? 
  o'donovan rossa , the one who planted no warning bombs ? 
  you are correct , and i should have been more precise . 
  i was referring to hate preachers , jihadis and the such . 
  * some * violent philosophy would have likely filled the void in those places eventually because of the whole colonial thing , obviously militant secular nationalists like the ira or eta would be preferable from most peoples point of view . 
  why is there no militant islam in albania or tatarstan ? 
  - because these are secular stable places without any serious grudges or socioeconomic problems that gives violence the oxygen it needs . 
  i do n't think 7 % of the population are islamists , you 'd have far more frequent attacks if that were the case . 
  if france purged its islamists , you would see a massive improvement within a decade at the very very latest . 
  you are assuming that i am one of those hopelessly naive types when i just called isis `` sunni supremacists '' in a comment below . 
  in the very worst case , there 's the algeria/chechnya/ireland solution , which broadly involves giving the intelligence and security services free rein to tackle the problems at any cost . 
  if someone is associated with salafists , have them assassinated until the problem goes away . 
  the disadvantage is that the government can turn into * un pouvoir * , even in a democracy like ireland there is a serious problem with the civil service and elites running roughshod over the population 80 years after the civil war . 
  edit : i would guess your complaints about 20 years of nonsense and problem populations refer to the fact that immigrants can feel more loyal to north africa than france sometimes ? 
  i am unsure what to say about that to be honest in light of irish history . 
  i note though that ireland has had trouble since around 2015 with islamists being somewhat belligerent , or making demands which are pretty out of order given that there are only 40,000 muslims here , such as calls to prayer on the state broadcaster . 
  is thrive off sunni muslim 's fear of shia paramilitary organisations in iraq , which were formed as a reaction to al qaeda in iraq 's bombing campaigns . 
  i was thinking of when merkel said wednesday when she said all voices would be heard equally , as if car exports were equivalent to 3,000 people dead in northern ireland, 
  we are talking economic collapse and civil war , you are underestimating the potential damage . 
  most of their growth is inefficient state managed investment driven by ever growing huge amounts of debt . 
  just like the soviet union with oil revenues , eventually this source of funding will dry up . 
  edit : there are exports too , but that does not alter my point since most of those steel firms rely on subsidies when the government is going into debt and people are getting sick of chinese dumping . 
  that would fuck ireland over . 
  i was unsure as to why i was being downvoted , i asumed it by irish people off past experience when i brought up the ira/isis analogy . 
  so i edited my comment to point out that it was my intention to put isis in a broader context so people are less freaked out by them . 
  in addition i noted that i was not interested in taking sides on irish history here , rather i thought it best given the circumstances to leave the whole question of who was to blame out for fear of upsetting people , even if it makes michael collins look bad .
