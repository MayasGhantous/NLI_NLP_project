  despite being sunni supremacists with medieval views , isis are still revolutionaries in the modern sense like lenin . 
  the irish republicans used similar tactics in the past ; through excellent propoganda , making more `` moderate '' nationalists look weak , and provoking the british they whipped up latent sentiment and convinced everyone to support them during the war of independence . 
  the ira/fenians had plenty of implicit rhetorical support from the `` moderate '' nationalists as well . 
  in many ways sinn fein were walking the walk , where the irish parliamentary party only talked the talk . 
  so everyone just followed the real deal . 
  edit : it 's the simple truth of the matter that isis are not unprecedented as such . 
  mohhammed never attempted to inspire `` leaderless jihad '' through twitter . 
  i never said irish independence was a bad thing or the ira were `` wrong '' either , i was just using them to illustrate my point that everyone has seen this before and that isis do n't deserve much of their mystique , without getting dragged into inappropriate debates on terrorists vs freedom fighters . 
  i 'm sorry over all the people who were murdered , especially after all the other murders , but *** please *** do n't allow yourself to give into such feelings . 
  this has been isis ' * modus operandi * since they [ blew up the al-askari mosque in 2006 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_al-askari_mosque_bombing ) , which was one of the holiest sites in shia islam . 
  they want to make people angry and frustrated , and lose faith in the government so they try to take things in to their own hands , and to undermine the social contract in general . 
  these people thrive off weak states , hate and sectarianism . 
  maybe it 's macabre to bring this up , but if it was isis , then this should be thought of as an svbied without the explosives . 
  it 's just a date in the eu 's diary , but all the foreign ministers would attend . 
  there are serious parallels between john redmond and his `` model prisoner '' approach roughly 100 years ago , and enda kenny with berlin today . 
  the bundeskanzlerin was pretty rude to the taoiseach , she could have been more concillatory , e.g `` we are very concerned ourselves about the idea of trade barriers , and are more than mindful of the eu 's historic role in fostering peace in europe . 
  nonetheless we must bear in mind that ireland and germany are only 2 countries out of 27 and that the uk has not yet clarified its position yet ... '' i can only conclude she wanted to deliberately cause humiliation . 
  if the borders go up ireland is looking at war and economic ruin . 
  is merkel hoping to use our desperation to get us to give up our corporate tax rate ? 
  plotting with france to drive us out of the eu in the hopes of pursuing a * kerneuropa * ? 
  british bankers are n't going to be allowed to sell their services to europe if polish plumbers do n't get reciprocal rights . 
  fta with no services access is reasonable . 
  actually , now that i think of it , your use of `` some '' risks giving the impression that only a small minority ever had problems , which is untrue . 
   because even if they were just as bad ... 
   because even if they were just as bad ... 
  speaking as one of the most `` anglosceptic '' irish redditors around , the idea that the country is going embrace poverty , risk a civil war and put up with expensive imports from the uk just for the sake of some eurofederalist fantasy is just bizarre . 
  everyone knows we wo n't get any help whatsover off the rest of europe , so why bother ? 
  the error on my part was assuming that any british person who writes lengthy responses to anything i write on the past is automatically some hard core british nationalist , accordingly i went looking for an interpretation that confirmed my belief . 
  the bulk of your comment is spent arguing that the uk does n't engage in discrimination full stop . 
  and citing irish ancestry is often used as an excuse to make someone seem more informed than they really are . 
  since i noted that i was reasoning hypothetically , it looked initially as if you had skimmed what i wrote and just banged out a lazy reflexive response , with a token comment on `` our special relationship '' tacked on to the end . 
   because even if they were just as bad ... usually being rude gets you nowhere , but you clearly missed the point if you managed to skip over the very first clause of my comment lol . 
  and your touchiness supports my argument in any case , i notice any kind of references to irish history can make british people very upset . 
  anti catholic discrimination and violence against irish people has provoked several wars and civil wars that the uk still has n't recovered from . 
  constant complaining from london about lazy spaniards would inevitably resuscitate those tensions , especially in light of the recent attacks on eastern europeans . 
  because even if they were just as bad , they are constrained in the degree of anti-latin stuff they can get away with in light of the various conflicts in and with ireland . 
  in practice , without the exchange rates being able to absorb any shocks , the instability just gets transferred elsewhere . 
  hence the rise of the likes of le pen . 
  it would have been much more sensible to have a bretton-woods style system with a `` european monetary fund '' to provide loans to deal with the severe balance of payments crises on top of fairly generous structural and cohesion funds . 
  that does n't surprise me , given ireland has been pursuing a strategy of relying on indigenous exports and attracting foreign firms and capital since tk whitaker published his plan around the early 1960s nonetheless , the current system is not working , so something will have to give . 
  there are rules against such large surpluses , but brussels refuses to enforce them . 
  i keep predicting that eventually southern europe will do with germany , what ireland did with england before , and impose tariffs ( or other barriers ) on german goods . 
  but no one believes me ... 
  it ultimately depends on the pecking order and the size of the assets should the bank get wound up , hence the heavy use of hedging in my comment . 
  the `` bail in '' rules are very broad as described in article 55 of the [ brrd ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/pdf/?uri=celex:32014l0059&amp;from=en ) , anything not specifically excluded under article 44 ( 2 ) is potentially vulnerable to getting a haircut . 
  the conditions for exclusion there are strict i.e. 
  `` liabilities to institutions , excluding entities that are part of the same group , with an original maturity of less than seven days '' . 
  there is `` any liability that arises by virtue of a fiduciary relationship between the institution or entity referred to in point ( b ) , ( c ) or ( d ) of article 1 ( 1 ) ( as fiduciary ) and another person ( as beneficiary ) provided that such a beneficiary is protected under the applicable insolvency or civil law ; '' but i 'd say banks are sophisticated enough to be excluded , especially given that uncovered deposits in general are excluded , feel free to correct me though . 
  it 's the wholesale bank for for the state of bremen . 
  so if it fails , all of its depositors , mainly the smaller * banks * thoughout the region are in danger of losing money after already being under pressure due to low interest rates . 
  so that 's another round of potential failures before ordinary people risk losing their own deposits . 
  a collapse could be pretty spectacular , except confined to a specific region of germany . 
  deposits over $ 100,000 are below senior bonds under brrd , hence renzi 's application of pressure now . 
  problem is that other german entities like allianz or commerzbank are exposed to db . 
  under brrd , ordinary german savers could be bailed in to make these financial firms whole if necessary . 
  naming no names herr finanzminister ... 
  dig a moat and make isis pay for it . 
  70 % of its revenue comes from outside the uk . 
  more like cersei lannister . 
  broad support / s, 
  nope they let ireland in in 1973 , in spite of all the religious crap that was going on - including locking females away for engaging in sinful behavior until 1995 , or that indian woman that died because she could n't get an abortion . 
  for that reason i have always been a bit skeptical of opposition to letting turkey into the eu . 
  why the turks do n't try to make hay with this point is beyond me . 
  its worth keeping in mind that i have seen germans complain about albanians on reddit , and you had anti-irish prejudice up until the late 1990s . 
  my impression is that many northern european societies simply do n't get on well in general with nations that have/had an honour culture even before you add on the baggage with islam and the ottoman empire . 
  you need to put a triple backslash on the left . 
  maximise exposure . 
  you 'll just have to let the theocracy run its course until everyone gets sick of it like ireland from 1922 to 1997 . 
  otherwise you will always be dealing with islamists claiming paradise is only just around the corner ... 
  you already have a free trade zone ? 
  i think the damage was done by ~ 2005 when the eu made it clear that no muzzies allowed . 
  they let us in in 1973 when we locked women and girls away for unwholesome behaviour until 1995 , and sawed women 's vaginas open so they could have more babies until around 1987 , and contraceptives without prescription were banned until 1992 . 
  but we 're * catholics * you see . 
  silly mike , demographics were/are on the catholics side . 
  by 2000 it was have been around 45 % catholic . 
  if the whole oppression continued , the birthrate would have stayed elevated and ni might have been majority catholic by 2010 , or even 2008 . 
  bitter catholics in no mood to make concessions . 
  but all the old people would have been protestants before then . 
  the unionists would have had to cut a worse deal than the one they got sometime around 2005 at the latest . 
  fine then : northern ireland around 1965 . 
  edit : in 2008 , you had people crashing lorries into the oireachtas and a drunkard for a leader . 
  irish nationalism is of a leftwing anti colonial variety , it 's actually at a 5 year peak , you just have n't noticed . 
  ireland is still here after a far worse crisis . 
  ireland around 2008-2010 . 
  as others pointed out here , the balkans has loads of mountains , little enclaves , isolated villages etc. 
  like france with deficits , or germany with macroeconomic imbalances ? 
  the first $ 100,000 deposited is safe entirely so it 's `` only '' pensioners and businesses that get wrecked . 
  great post . 
  as the other guy pointed out in his very good post explaining the situation , this guarantee only applies to *** solvent *** banks ... and none of the banks are solvent . 
   six-month italian guarantee scheme to provide liquidity to *** solvent *** banks in case of need [ renzi a few weeks from now ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwfk5jyd2ba ), 
  we did it with britain when * 90 % * of our exports went there , over debts , and they capitulated in the end . 
  and no , you would n't be more fucked since exports only account for 30 % of your gdp vs 50 % for germany . 
  one can maybe conceive of italy maintaining its current level of employment under autarky , ca n't same the same for an exporting powerhouse . 
  i suspect germany wants to force an esm bailout so the troika can come in and `` reform '' the country . 
  they ca n't risk the euro failing right now in case le pen wins office and imposes tariffs against their goods , crippling their economy as the rest of club med joins in . 
  that 's what irish people thought too , and we just ended up voting in ruthless ultranationalists who just killed anyone who stepped out of line . 
  of course you have to take into account that ireland is roughly the albania of northern europe , and maybe more willing to kill and inflict suffering for political ends than italy is when push comes to shove . 
  but it 's one thing to fight a three year war against a country ten times your size , and another to set up a customs post in the brenner pass . 
  besides , germany 's export vulnerability and need for the single market is out in the open now - since britain is not a eurozone member they can not obscure the issue like with greece . 
  so sooner or later people will point out whole reason for italy was to stop everyone getting raped by france and germany .
