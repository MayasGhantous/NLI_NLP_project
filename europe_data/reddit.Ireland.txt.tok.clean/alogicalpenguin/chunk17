  to be honest , it would probably be an improvement .

  for what it 's worth , i pretty much have the same reaction about you anytime immigration is brought up . 
  it should n't be , but when our constitution was drafted , the archdiocese was consulted on issues relating to morality and the family . 
   what did the irish constitution say regarding marriage before the vote , i guess it specifically mentioned marriage as being between a man and a woman ? 
  not explicitly , but article 41.3 . makes reference to the fact that `` the state pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage , on which the family is founded , and to protect it against attack '' . 
  though marriage is n't directly defined , it was assumed by high court justices during the zappone case that marriage is confined to opposite sex couples as the constitution sets out that the family is based on marriage . 
  in particular , article 41.2.1 recognized the valuable contribution a mother plays in the family unit . 
   this is the downside to actually having a formal constitution on the bright side , marriage equality is now enshrined into the constitution . 
  any constitutional change requires a referendum . 
  if marriage equality was passed legislatively , the supreme court would have struck it down . 
  but whats considered extreme depends on circumstance . 
  in the 18th century , classical liberalism would have been considered extreme in the sense that it proposed radical change . 
  yet , no one would hold to the view that classical liberals have much in common with traditionalist monarchists because factually , that view would be wrong . 
  there are clear distinctions between the two ideologies .

  a little but not particularly , they just really dislike the current government and have a reputation for opposing every single referendum imaginable .

  polling yes at 55 % atm . 
  have rte called it ? 
  opening tallies for dublin seem really promising . 
  edit : dublin looks like it could be a landslide , while rural areas such as wicklow will vote no . 
  granted , these are just tallies so do n't get too excited just yet . 
  13 out of 120 limerick city boxes have been tallied with 62 % for the yes vote . 
  kerry north looks like it will be the first rural constituency to vote yes . 
  dublin constituencies smashing the yes vote home with some constituencies voting as high as 80 % in favour of yes . 
  dub south east w / inner city figures coming in . 
  77 % yes , 22 % no donegal polling at 55 % ( yes ) . 
  ardee ( louth ) looking like a majority no vote 71 % yes out of another dublin south constituency box . 
  interesting turn of events , wicklow could swing yes the opposition have just conceded defeat . 
  the polls would indicate that it should pass but i 'm not entirely sure . 
  as most of us are aware , polling agencies do have their faults so we certainly should n't be too complacent with some of the more favorable polls . 
  ultimately , it will come down to who votes . 
  progressive urban areas such as dublin will be a landslide yes vote , while more rural constituencies will vote no .

   absolutely . 
  the left-right spectrum mostly makes sense from a centrist position , where you can comfortably bunch up anarcho-syndicalists and marxism-leninism on one side and fascism and anarcho-capitalists on the other . 
  definitely agree with this . 
  it does n't really apply without looking through the lens of the simple left-right political dichotomy . 
  is n't the horseshoe theory mostly disregarded by political scientists ? 
  they 're campaigning on issues related to surrogacy and adoption , most of which have been dealt with legislatively via the children and family relationship bill passed last year . 
   it 's still in the bag . 
  i hope so but at this stage , i 'm not sure . 
  the no campaign have done a great job at purposely misleading the general public and slowly changing the subject of the debate . 
  we just need to nudge wales , brittany , the isle of man and cornwall in the right direction and eurovision will finally be ours . 
  ex-yugoslavs got nothing on us . 
  [ given greece 's negative balance of payments , ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/why-greece-won-t-ever-be-able-to-pay-off-its-debts-with-austerity ) do you really think it 's feasible to retain a surplus of such mandated by the structural adjustment program ? 
  but the previous government , new democracy did comply with the mandate of the structural adjustment program . 
  [ despite this , greece has still not met the expectations set by troika models  ( http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/paul-krugman-syriza-should-ignore-calls-to-be-responsible-1.2080112 )  the economic projections that accompanied the standby arrangement assumed that greece could impose harsh austerity with little effect on growth and employment . 
  greece was in recession when the deal was reached , but the projections assumed this downturn would end soon -- that there would be only a small contraction in 2011 , and that , by 2012 , greece would be recovering . 
  unemployment , the projections conceded , would rise substantially , from 9.4 per cent in 2009 to almost 15 per cent in 2012 , but would then begin coming down fairly quickly . 
   what actually transpired was an economic and human nightmare . 
  far from ending in 2011 , the greek recession gathered momentum . 
  greece did n't hit the bottom until 2014 and , by that point , it had experienced a full-fledged depression , with overall unemployment rising to 28 per cent and youth unemployment rising to almost 60 per cent . 
  and the recovery now under way is barely visible , offering no prospect of pre-crisis living standard greece have followed the mandate to the point of attempting to obtain a ridiculously high primary surplus in a recessionary period . 
  do n't pretend they did n't just because it does n't suit your bias .

  nope . 
  you gov exit poll is more promising , but damn that one did worry me . 
  i cringe at the taught that the dup could be involved in any government . 
  oh god , / r/scotland is going to loose their shit !, 
  fuck me , that exit poll is something else . 
  should be interesting . 
  my bet is still on labour gaining snp support in some form of informal agreement . 
  cameron will probably protest about legitimacy , and lobby for lib dem support . 
  either way , it 's going to be some election . 
  do n't know why you 're getting downvoted , we eat far to much red meat and it 's one of the major contributors to both heart disease , and obesity rates . 
  but it 's a pretty big mouthful for a poster . 
   have you wondered how greece keeps meeting its debt repayments and other bills , despite being on the brink of bankruptcy ? 
   well , the secret is that athens reverted to the tried and tested route of cutting back on spending , and squeezing as much taxation out as possible . 
  hopefully the mandate regarding greece 's primary surplus can be reduced . 
  considering that greece has a negative balance of payments , it seems very unreasonable to demand such a high surplus . 
   what the past greek government accomplished was laudable , particularly considering greece 's track record , but turning a primary deficit into a primary surplus is a basic requirement for avoiding actually going bankrupt , let alone stop the sovereign debt to baloon even further . 
  so , i honestly do n't understand why someone would try ti criticize this accomplishment . 
  you 're ignoring some important details , the negative balance of payments coupled with a lack of capital from previous economic expansion periods makes the attempts at sustaining a primary surplus very unlikely . 
  thus , the odds of greece actually meeting the standards needed to return to normal eurozone debt levels is unrealistic : http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-19/why-greece-won-t-ever-be-able-to-pay-off-its-debts-with-austerity not to mention the fact that it encourages cuts in spending during a recessionary slump , which has been a tremendous disaster for fostering growth .
