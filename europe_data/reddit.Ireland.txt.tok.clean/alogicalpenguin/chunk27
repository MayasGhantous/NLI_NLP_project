  the question posed dealt with british attitudes towards their colonial past . 
  a past in which people such as myself were brutally murdered due to both negligence and abuse . 
  one in which our culture and language was deliberately curtailed , a past in which the famine of 1845 caused the deaths of nearly 1.5 million innocent people , one where institutional discrimination was entranced into law via the penal codes . 
  how is this something to be proud of ? 
  it 's a shame that this place turned into such right-wing echo chamber . 
  it used to be a great sub , certainly one my top five . 
  it was meant to be a stupid joke about trump winning the presidential election . 
  the attlee administration was post-ww2 and no , she was n't . 
  she 's one of the most polarising figures in the history of british politics . 
   kwazi kwarteng , one of a relatively small number of black members of parliament , notes that the debate has been `` sanitized '' because it has ignored the long tradition of nativism and xenophobia in u.s. history . 
  nativism , says the historian and conservative member , is very much within the american political tradition . 
  and trump is part of that history . 
  he may want to ban muslims , but `` the answer to his ban is not to ban him . '' doing so would only give him more publicity , generating `` headlines around the world . '' and besides , trump could win . 
  `` and then we would be in the absurd situation of having banned the president of the united states . '' pls no . 
  how 's what working out ? 
  fran\u00e7ois hollande is a moderate leader of a modern social democratic political party , not some die hard m-l-m communist . 
  let me guess , american ? 
  the french socialist party are n't socialist , at least if we 're using the traditional definition of socialism . 
  most polarising maybe , but not the most liked . 
  attlee would be considered far more popular than thatcher . 
  scots are the only people who hate her more than we do . 
  greedy unions did n't cause the financial crisis . 
  edinburgh is beautiful . 
  oxford would be another good choice . 
  similar situation over here . 
  a right to a solicitor during interrogation was only conferred as of 2014 after a ruling from the supreme court . 
  the importance of ecthr rulings depends upon a number of factors ( the incorporation of the echr into domestic law , national derogation of certain provisions , constitutional law etc ) that pertains to a particular jurisdiction . 
  in ireland , the convention has not been incorporated into irish law and its provision can not be relied solely upon during a case . 
  relevant statutory law that allows the courts to interpret legislation in line with the convention insofar as possible does place a greater significance upon said rulings but still , it 's not the sole reason for the ( irish ) supreme courts decisions with regards to ones right to a solicitor during police interrogation . 
  salduz vs turkey did play an important role in the courts decision but it was not the be-all and end-all of the courts decision . 
   i 'm left wondering how it sounds . 
  [ ah-ve-leen ] [ fwee ] [ hane ] [ iss ] [ fwee ] [ wash-uh/ah ] [ dee-uv ] - it would sound somewhat similar to this but alas , there may be some faults . 
  my irish is decent but could use some improvement . 
  that 's honestly terrifying .

  sigh , can we please stop with the non-sense that is the horseshoe theory . 
   the left-leaning anti-austerity blogosphere joined anglo big capital in their attempt to derail the eurozone british corporations are , generally speaking , pro-eu so i 'm not sure one could could argue that they are attempting to derail either the eurozone or the eu . 
  secondly , the far-left and the far-right oppose the eu for very different reasons . 
  the left opposes the liberalization of markets and capital , while the right opposes free movement of people . 
   in greece , the far right forms a government with the far left , as pointed out in the article . 
  syriza formed a government with the independent greeks because they were the only viable anti-austerity political party and , to state the obvious , they ( syriza ) did n't procure enough votes for a parliamentary majority . 
  this is how electoral democracy is supposed to work . 
   supporters of die linke join xenophobic pegida demonstrators source pls . 
  die linke has been very pro-refugee . 
   traditionally , the french communist far left has often resorted to racist tactics to rally support among its supporters i 'm not aware of this but the one virtue of most communist parties has been their opposition to racism . 
  this is n't true , the left as a whole has shifted to the right over the last three decades . 
  even the more `` radical '' and `` populist '' left-wing political parties base much of their economic platform on mainstream keynesian thought . 
  it absolutely is . 
  the consensus among most sociologists , psychologists , and psychiatrists is that by and large , children raised by same-sex parents fare just as well as children raised by heterosexual parents . 
  the [ canadian psychological association ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20090419195945/http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/documents/marriage%20of%20same-sex%20couples%20position%20statement%20-%20october%202006%20%281%29.pdf ) , the [ australian psychology society ] ( http://www.psychology.org.au/assets/files/lgbt-families-lit-review.pdf ) , and the american psychological association are just a few organizations who have conducted studies that have clearly shown that children raised by same-sex parents are as well-adjusted as children raised by their heterosexual counterparts . 
  further more , academic literature conducted by various academic institutions has consistently pointed towards a similar conclusion : http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/126/1/28.full http://psc.dss.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/ap_06_pre.pdf https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/publications/same-sex-parented-families-australia  mark regnerus r/badsocialscience would like to have a word with you . 
   if the japanese-americans formed a party that has connections with japanese government , you 're right . 
  but it was n't the case . 
  no , but it was motivated by the same logic that japanese-americans were , despite being u.s nationals , a `` fifth column '' that posed a threat to national security . 
  to use a more pertinent example , was the blacklisting of members of the u.s communist party during the glory days of mccarthyism justified ? 
  or was the soviet union 's repression of any non-bolshevik aligned political party justified ? 
   also do n't make banning parties aiming at limiting the independence of your country as a collapse of democracy . 
  again , it absolutely is . 
  democracy should n't only apply to those we agree with . 
  this was the same rationale used to intern japanese-americans after the attack on pearl harbor and has routinely been used by governments to exert power and infringe on basic human rights . 
   it 's not about liberal european values , but about surviving of the country . 
  considering the ukrainian government intends to foster closer european relations via integration , yes , it absolutely is . 
  banning political and ideological opponents sets a terrible precedent and anyone who supposedly espouses `` liberal european values '' while advocating for tight restrictions on both freedom of speech and democratic involvement is at best , a hypocrite and at worst , a totalitarian demagogue . 
  i strongly doubt he 's going to win but to be honest , neither would burnham , cooper , or kendall . 
  under his leadership , labour won the oldham west and royton by-election ( granted , with a moderate candidate ) and generally , [ most polls show labour are performing slightly better than the 2015 general election result . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_next_united_kingdom_general_election#/media/file:uk_2015-20_election_opinion_polls.png ) i know this sub despises the man , but can we please stop with the hyperbolic mantra that he 's single-handedly going to destroy the labour party . 
  a distant relative of mine over in the u.s was pretty adamant that i was either speaking norwegian or swedish . 
  it has n't . 
  socialist economies based on particular strains of socialist thought have existed and yes , there are very valid criticisms as to why people would , to use a more extreme example , oppose the implementation of a command economy but i 'm not sure how one could argue that a communist society has ever come to fruition . 
  if we 're to be a little pedantic , minor primitive communist societies during the paleolithic age have existed but there has never been a transition from a modern industrialised civilization to a communist society as envisioned by marx and engels . 
   she is . 
  i know , i was using it as a comparison for her stance on same-sex marriage . 
  i 'm very much aware that the fn is very different to the republican party . 
   how is it discriminatory ? 
  it treats people who are attracted to the same-sex in a different manner to their heterosexual counterparts . 
   the only discriminatory treatment is gay marriage . 
  lovely , more absurd hyperbole . 
   in normal marriage marriage as a social construct has changed throughout history , often depending on societal and cultural norms . 
  this notion of `` normal marriage '' is ridiculous . 
   in gay marriage , children are a commodity more absurd hyperbole . 
   to be ordered like fast food in collaboration with surrogate mothers most same-sex couples adopt children , so surrogacy is very rare . 
  regardless , anyone who thinks that adoption/surrogacy is in anyway similar to literally buying children is laughably deluded . 
   i can believe it since it 's a simple fact . 
  i 'm not denying that your wrong . 
  i 'm pointing out the absurdity of using it as a justification for discriminatory treatment . 
   no , it 's not like saying that . 
  false equivalence . 
  it 's exactly like that . 
   any more fallacious emotional arguments ? 
  this is funny , considering almost all arguments opposed to same-sex marriage are based on both emotional appeal and are , in general , very fallacious in nature . 
  yeah , i just kinda assumed that was a mistype . 
  you could n't seriously believe that ? 
  that 's akin to saying you have the right to practice religion , as long as you practice the `` correct '' state sanction religion . 
  it 's a stupid argument . 
  no , they have n't . 
  same-sex marriage was only recently introduced , prior to which civil unions were allowed but even then , civil unions were n't always a `` right '' . 
  she 's opposed to both gay marriage and adoption , and her party was at the forefront of the protests against the introduction of same-sex marriage . 
  i 'm not saying that she 's a virulent homophobe but let 's cut the criclejerk , she 's opposed to the premise of equal treatment . 
  she 's no different to most u.s republicans . 
  so to answer his question more directly , yes , she 's opposed to gay rights .
