  i 'm going to disagree with most people here , i think / u/hjongoldrake would make a great mod . 
  / u/reilly616 would probably be a close second for me , but i 'd be pretty satisfied if either of them were chosen . 
   the response should be based on reason , not based on going `` well this did n't work , ergo , everything on this end of the political spectrum is a failure and we should do what i said we should do in the first place . '', 
  that 's fair . 
  with that said , i 'd argue that in this particular case , left-wing ( or typically what is denoted as left-wing ) policies seem to be far more reasonable , and tend to have the [ backing ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/did-the-stimulus-work-a-review-of-the-nine-best-studies-on-the-subject/2011/08/16/giqathbibj_blog.html ) of [ most academics . 
  ] ( http://mainlymacro.blogspot.ie/2015/06/the-academic-consensus-on-impact-of.html ), 
   if overspending fails will the left-wing establishment finally admit that they were wrong ? 
  first of all , there is no left-wing establishment . 
  if there was , we would n't be in this mess . 
  secondly , macroeconomic models are complex . 
  overspending can be beneficial , especially during a recessionary period . 
  in contrast to left-wing solutions for the crisis , the structural adjustment program simply wo n't work . 
  the fact that greece are obligated to run a 3.5 % primary surplus ( over the midterm ) to service their debt , despite running both a negative balance of payments and a trade deficit for most of the decade is a testament to how absurd this program is . 
  when the austerity program fails , will the european right-wing establishment finally admit that they were wrong ? 
  or are we going to continue playing merkel 's favorite game , [ extend and pretend ? 
  ] ( http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/greece-troika-fiscal-reform-by-lucrezia-reichlin-et-al-2015-06 ), 
   i hope for a nd win so next the government will execute the european program to create stability and pick up the growing trend again that started last year . 
  the minor growth of real gdp coincided with a nominal growth slower than that of average prices , so i 'm not sure how one could argue that the greek economy was `` picking up '' . 
  it just seems a tad bit too disingenuous for my liking : http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do http://www.ceicdata.com/en/statistics/greece/nominal-gdp, 
  i honestly ca n't believe that there are comments itt condoning the actions of terrorists . 
  it 's fucking disgusting . 
  god , this sub is going to shit . 
   your website shows a positive real gdp growth from 2014 q3 . 
  is that a collapse ? 
  is that better than gdp growth in 2013 , 2012 , . . or not ? 
  i do n't think you quite understand what i 'm saying . 
  the fact that gdp fell in nominal terms in conjunction with deflation shows that real gdp did n't account for the actual output of the greek economy . 
  just to make my point clear , here are two illustrations regarding the rate of nominal gdp and average prices : http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do http://www.ceicdata.com/en/statistics/greece/nominal-gdp  this is getting out of subject is it ? 
  i 'd argue the surplus needed to service the debt is rather important , given the fact that the crisis is fundamentally about debt sustainability . 
   ( i 'm just saying statistics were starting look better in 2014 ) . 
  see my first point . 
   and i do n't understand why a negative balance of payments in the past years would necessarely prevent a government from reaching a surplus . 
  again , you 're missing my point . 
  greece can run ( and has ) a positive balance of payment , just not maintain it . 
   government reduces its spending , and there you have it , a surplus . 
  see above point . 
  as an aside , how do you plan on dealing with the byproducts of spending reduction in a recessionary period , namely rapid decreases in national income for the short run ? 
   so if i understand you well , new policies must have positive effects immediately ? 
  the `` new policies '' caused ( or at the very least , exacerbated ) the peak difference between pre-crisis gdp and the levels shown in your graphs . 
  the fact that there was moderate growth in gdp is n't exactly cause for celebration , especially once you consider my first point regarding deflation . 
  considering that the growth of real gdp coincided with a nominal growth slower than that of average prices , i 'd be weary about deeming the nd tenure as a success : http://www.ceicdata.com/en/statistics/greece/nominal-gdp i really ca n't understand the rationale behind this idea that , somehow , a country which has run both a negative balance of payments and a trade deficit for most of the decade will find the means to miraculously finance the necessary surplus required the meet the obligations of the memorandum ( seriously , a 3.5 % primary surplus over the midterm ?! ) . 
  it 's just absurd . 
   http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/unemployment-rate are you really attributing a decrease in unemployment to the austerity policies of the nd government ? 
  considering the impact of their tenure over their entire term , this seems a tad bit ironic , no ? 
  there are a few issues i have with some of his policies , but i actually quite like him . 
  his stance on austerity , lgbt rights , investment and nationalization of the railways appeal not only to me , but to many ordinary working people . 
  of course , there are certain issues regarding the `` peoples qe '' that i 'm very much skeptical about , but overall , i think he 's providing a clear opposition to osborne 's madness . 
  if i 'm in the uk during the ge , i 'll probably vote for him . 
  edit : just some stats to illustrate the popularity of some of his more `` controversial opinions '' : https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/05/11/why-do-people-support-rail-nationalisation/ https://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/11/04/nationalise-energy-and-rail-companies-say-public/ https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/01/29/three-trumps-could-win-labour-election/, 
   tsipras failure is the fundemental flaw of socialist ideology , and expecting it to be possible to be implemented in a modern country in 2015 . 
  but most of their policies were n't socialist . 
  advocating keynesian expansionary policy in conjunction with european integration in the banking sector is n't exactly what most people describe as socialist . 
  certainly there were constituency groups such as the left platform who were socialist , but the vast majority of the party was ( and is ) rather moderate . 
  if anything , they 're more akin to the social democrats of the 1970s . 
   second , the troika bailout was n't used for the banks , but for government spending . 
  it 's slightly more complicated . 
  yes , recapitalization of banks was administered prior to the eap , namely due to immediate issues of solvency , so you 're correct in that regard . 
  however , the eap was a response to recapitalization , not necessarily a response to previous government spending . 
  government commitments to the domestic banking sector resulted in a sizable deficit ( perhaps this is what you meant ? ), 
  and bond yield increases detouring the government from borrowing at a market rate . 
  the proceeding european financial stability fund divided a portion of funds to deal with further recapitalization of banks . 
   first , water charges were already on the government 's agenda before the troika - they just needed to find someone willing to take the political flak this does n't really contradict what / u/centralcontinental said . 
  you may be correct , but water charges were mandated by the memorandum . 
   they 're going as far to vote for fn no , they 're not . 
  i hate to break this to you , but three people do n't speak for the entire gay community . 
  i sincerely doubt many gay people are supporting a party which opposes lgbt rights . 
   well , the reason i support the austerity program is because i know that there are no better alternatives that are politically and economically feasible . 
  you see , i do n't consider the austerity program an alternative as i do n't think it adequately addresses the major problems , debt sustainability ( and to a lesser extent , a lack of fiscal union within the ez ) . 
  i 'd rather argue for genuine reform than endorse a forced consensus that i oppose . 
  there are plenty of solutions , none of which are politically feasible , unfortunately . 
  reforms of the esm that would allow for direct recapitalization of national banks in conjunction with the formation of a banking union , formation of a european investment bank , eurobonds , a greater degree of authority for the ecb with regards to qe programs , direct provisional amendments to the maastricht treaty allowing for debt conversion , multilateral default and capital injection programs would all be suitable alternatives . 
  the fact that these alternatives are n't politically feasible does not justify a flawed program . 
  if anything , it 's a testament to ordoliberal stubbornness . 
   it grew in one quarter , the peak tourism and traditionally strongest quarter for greece , amid record breaking amounts of tourists . 
  none of that can be attributed to syriza . 
  tourism may factor in , especially considering that it accounts for [ 18 % of gdp ] ( http://www.theodora.com/wfbcurrent/greece/greece_economy.html ) , but to suggest it 's the sole reason for the increase in gdp is a tad bit too simplistic . 
   unilateral default i 'd obviously be opposed to a unilateral default , but in the long run i do n't think it 's the worst option . 
   multilateral default would obviously be the best option . 
   austerity measures completely disagree . 
  austerity measures may reduce the deficit which factors into debt sustainability calculations , but they tend to reduce gdp ( in the short run ) escalating the debt to gdp ratio . 
  another major point that should detour greece from following such measures is the 3.5 % primary surplus ( over the midterm ) rate that is needed to reduce said deficit . 
  a primary surplus of that rate for greece simply is n't feasible . 
  for most of the decade , greece has ran a [ negative balance of payments ] ( http://statinfo.biz/charts/22/current_account_balance_percent_of_gdp__greece_44238.png ) and continues to run a [ trade deficit ] ( http://blogg.nhh.no/kriseprogrammet/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/trade_balance.jpg ) . 
  to suggest that greece can run the required surplus is , in my view , simply wrong . 
  austerity may reduce the deficit , but it does n't really address other variables such as the rate of nominal gdp ( - the interest rate of gov bonds ) and the levels of debt to gdp when calculating the sustainability of government debt . 
  edit : trade deficit stats that pertain to the 2014 and 2015 years : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/charts/greece-balance-of-trade?embed?embed.png&amp;s=gktbale&amp;v=201507081007, 
   i was referring to the early years of the crisis fair enough , but real gdp only showed a moderate increase during the new democracy administration so i 'd be weary about praising such a government . 
   compared to just before syriza got into power . 
  during the negotiation ( and prior to cap controls ) gdp grew under the syriza administration . 
  i believe another user linked you the relevant stats . 
   as to the actions of the ecb , they were necessary due to the financial situation of greece . 
  when the ecb cut emergency funding to greece despite the solvency of the banking sector , it should n't have come as a surprise that many people began to raise their eyebrows . 
  you could make the argument that it was necessary , but do n't be surprised when people begin to question the political independence of the ecb . 
   an improvement an improvement of gdp , not actual economic output . 
   relative stability for the time being perhaps , but the only way in which genuine stability can be achieved is by addressing the debt sustainability problem . 
   gdp free falling as it has been capital controls were a necessary response to the actions of the ecb . 
   it was now relatively stable not quite , the fact gdp fell in nominal terms in conjunction with deflation shows that real gdp did n't account for the actual output of the greek economy . 
   gdp was growing real gdp only increased due to the fact that nominal gdp continued to drop at a slower rate than average prices : http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do http://www.ceicdata.com/en/statistics/greece/nominal-gdp, 
  it 's `` fictional '' in the same sense that atlas shrugged is fictional . 
  it 's quite evident that that the book is pushing a political agenda that is rooted in paranoia .
