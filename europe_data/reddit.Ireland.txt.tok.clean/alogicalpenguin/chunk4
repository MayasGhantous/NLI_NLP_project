  as for the racism and xenophobia , again , it 's quite evident :  [ as the refugee fleet arrives on french shores , a noble old professor kills a fellow white who is depicted as having sold out his race and civilization . 
  afterwards , as he celebrates the killing , the professor reflects on the loss of white pride . ], 
  the old professor understood . 
  that scorn of a people for other races , the knowledge that one 's own is best , the triumphant joy at feeling oneself to be part of humanity 's finest -- none of that had ever filled these [ white ] youngsters ' brains , or at least so little that the monstrous cancer [ of compassion for other races ] implanted in the western conscience had quashed it in no time at all . 
   [ at one point , a french town , faced with the threat of diseased foreigners , issues an edict requiring arabs to get a certificate of health before using its public swimming pools . ], 
  retaliation took many forms . 
  ... a hundred nice french girls , teaching school in algeria , were suddenly hauled into the hospital and spread on the stirrups to be plumbed and explored by a squad of medical student commandos , whipped up to a frenzy . 
  two of them died as a result ...  [ the book repeatedly characterizes non-whites as sexual carnivores , as in this scene aboard the refugee fleet that is heading for europe . ], 
  but in time , very slowly , the flesh [ aboard the ships ] began to seethe . 
  ... perhaps it was the heat ... . 
  most of all , the natural drive of a people who never found sex to be sin . 
  ... [ e ] verywhere , a mass of hands and mouths , of phalluses and rumps . 
  ... young boys , passed from hand to hand . 
  young girls , barely ripe ... waking to the silent play of eager lips . 
  ... men with women , men with men , women with women , men with children ... . 
  and so , in a welter of dung and debauch -- and hope as well -- the last chance armada pushed on toward the west . 
   [ as the third world slaughter of whites picks up speed , the book describes a scene in a pig-processing plant in which a black man slaughters his white boss after being asked to kill pigs more quickly . ], 
  `` sure ` nough boss , '' one red-spattered black said , `` we can sure ` nough do one more at least ... '' the white man felt no more pain than any of the other pigs on the line . 
  stunned , hoisted , slaughtered . 
  ... [ hung from a hook , the murdered boss ' body ] caused ... no special disgust [ among the black workers ] . 
  they had seen such things before , after all . 
  at market , in the congo . 
   [ as the novel nears its end , lydie , depicted as a traitor to her white race , becomes a sexual plaything for the dark-skinned refugees who have now seized power . ], 
  lydie ... died in nice , in a whorehouse for hindus ... . 
  at the time , each refugee quarter had its stock of white women , all free for the taking . 
  ( one of the new regime 's laws , in fact . 
  in order to `` demythify '' white women , as they put it . ), 
  ... [ in the end , lydie , along with other white female sex slaves , is confined by the `` hindus '' to their ] `` white female practice and experimentation center . '', 
   [ the novel ends where it began , with the arrival of the refugee fleet in france . ], 
  [ f ] irst to land were the monsters , the grotesque little beggars from the streets of calcutta . 
  as they groveled through the wet sand like a pack of basset hounds , or a herd of clumsy seals exploring an unfamiliar shore , with their snorts and grunts of joy , they looked like an army of little green men from some remote planet . 
  yes , the country [ france ] would suit them fine . 
  no question . 
   near the end of the story the mayor of new york city is made to share gracie mansion with three families from harlem , the queen of the united kingdom must agree to have her son marry a pakistani woman , and only one drunken soviet soldier stands in the way of thousands of chinese people as they swarm into siberia . 
  i 'm not sure which is worse , the ridiculous paranoia , or the racist xenophobia . 
  edit : oh god , the wiki page on the author is amazing :  his traditional catholicism serves as an inspiration for many of his utopian works , in which the ideologies of communism and liberalism are shown to fail , and a catholic monarchy is restored . 
  in the novel sire , a french king is crowned in reims in february 1999 , the 18-year-old philippe pharamond de bourbon , a direct descendant of the last french kings . 
  the man actually wants to restore the bourbon monarchy . 
  last month another left-wing politician was targeted due to his stance on the refugee crisis . 
  [ michael richter 's ( a member of die linke ) car exploded in front of his house in freital , but no one was hurt ] ( http://rudaw.net/english/world/270720152 ) . 
   the other fact is that the soviets aided the `` republicans '' , while germany and italy supported the opposite side . 
  that 's true . 
   also , at that point of time germany still looked quite innocent while the soviets already had tens of millions victims of collectivisation and purges on their account . 
  i would n't agree with this . 
  germany had repeatedly violated international treaties , quit the league of nations and many of the allies were aware of proposed plans to annex the polish corridor and the city danzig . 
  by the end of the civil war , it was quite evident that hitler posed a threat . 
   even if it was less brutal then , people were still getting arrested , exploited and killed i 'm not denying this , i 'm just pointing out that most major soviet crimes were committed pre-khrushchev and thus , the crimes committed in the post-khrushchev era tend not to warrant major international tribunals that deal with crimes against humanity , generally speaking . 
   there 're still many people responsible for that which should be judged i 'm honestly not aware of any , but if there are , they should be tried . 
   unfortunatelly in many cases the `` european '' left prevents that and criticise every attempt at exposing , judging and condeming the communists . 
  the european left consists of communists who would have been sent to a gulag during stalin 's chairmanship . 
  suffice to say , they 're still communists , just of a different persuasion . 
  to blame people such as the left opposition for the actions of mao and stalin is , in my view , unfounded . 
  full disclaimer , i 'm not a communist . 
  i just think equating 20th century syndicalists with maoists is , like i said , unfounded . 
  their article on keynesian economics is [ hilariously absurd ] ( http://www.conservapedia.com/keynesian_economics#cite_note-milton-7 ) :  keynesian economics was the dominant economic paradigm from the 1940s to the 1970s . 
  it is associated with the ideas of the incompetent british economist and pedophile john maynard keynes . 
  in 2010 , his native land of britain ( which is deeply in debt ) repudiated his economic folly of government deficit spending through the implementation of an austerity budget during a period of economic difficulty . 
  either prague or venice . 
  france refused to support the republic on the basis of domestic issues , and pressure from other nations such as the uk . 
  if i recall correctly , they may have attempted to smuggle weapons but i 'm not entirely sure . 
  i 'm not denying that blum did n't sympathies with the second republic , but the fact remains , france did n't intervene . 
   really , you ca n't deny that almost every communist criminal got away unpunished . 
  this is fair . 
  with that said , most of the atrocities the soviet union committed were under the chairmanship of stalin . 
  regardless of your views of the su , you have to admit that there were far less horrific human rights abuses due to khrushchev 's administration . 
  most `` communists '' who committed crimes that could be addressed via a tribunal are almost certainly dead , with the exception of the khmer rouge . 
  just to clarify , i 'm differentiating between stalinist genocide and violations of freedom of speech , before you begin to rail against what i 've said about the post-khrushchev soviet union . 
   franco was actually supported by the usa some time after the wwii and spanish civil war , it 's not an example of a guy who came to power with their help . 
  this is actually correct , though the regime was propped up by the us , they did n't intervene during the civil war . 
  while we 're on the topic of the civil war , the lack of a response from the traditional western nations was based upon a fear of the 2nd republics socialist tendencies . 
  so in reality , many traditional european countries did play a role in franco 's emergence to power . 
   this is not what i was talking about . 
  fine , how about this : http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/13/us-hungary-warcrimes-idusbrea4c0ot20140513  but it 's not so simple to blame a one guy and excuse the whole system . 
  you could apply this sentiment to most religions and ideologies . 
   soviets were doing exactly the same things when did i say they were n't ? 
   still pinochet and franco were far better than average communist dictator i 'd rather live under castro and tito than fascists such as franco . 
   i do n't know a single communist criminal that was sentenced ceau\u0219escu . 
   capitalism is not an ideology , nobody invented it , that 's just a description of an economic system which developed in a natural way . 
  this is completely false . 
  capitalism is an idea rooted in the thought of classical liberal philosophers such as smith and ricardo . 
  in the history of human thought , it 's a relatively new ideology . 
   soviets were n't the only communist regime . 
  no , but most `` communist regimes '' typically followed the soviet model of marxist-leninism . 
   nobody was murdering except for the countless coups in latin america , the atrocities committed in vietnam and the propping up the pinochet and franco dictatorships . 
   we should and we do commemorate you 're missing my point . 
  i 'm saying that to blame `` capitalism '' for the atrocities committed by these nations is far too vague , given the fact that it 's a pretty varied ideology . 
   especially if the lefty internationale was directly dependant on kremlin so it 's now ok to ban political ideologies provided those who follow them have contact with our enemies ? 
   i guess you really do n't know what was happening in communist states . 
  i 'm well aware of what the su did . 
   you mean the circlejerk of the offended lefty primadonnas ? 
  you 're on one of the most right-wing sub on this entire site , there are n't too many left-wingers here . 
   were parts of that criminal ideology just as imperialism , genocide and slave labour was crucial to many western states and empires who were either mercantilist or capitalist in nature , generally speaking . 
  should we `` commemorate '' the victims of these atrocities ? 
   every regime tries to enforce its policies and prevent the opposition from challenging it , but the communists were especially `` effective '' at that . 
  ah , yes , because america did n't forcibly prevent political dissidents from engaging with the democratic process , nope , only the evil radical commies did that !, 
  [ oh wait , i forgot about this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_un-american_activities_committee ) and all of these : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smith_act_trials_of_communist_party_leaders https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/church_committee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jencks_v._united_states https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_scare https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jencks_act, 
  because it 's far too vague . 
  even ignoring the fact that their are broad tendencies of both communism and socialism , what crimes are `` we '' commemorating ? 
  does is include crimes committed due to communist ideology , or crimes committed by communist regimes . 
  if either the former or the latter , surely you could apply the exact same `` commemoration '' to the victims of capitalism and imperialism .
