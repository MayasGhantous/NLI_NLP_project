  i 'm honestly not sure how to feel about this . 
  on the one hand , he 's a reactionary bigot who 's been a terrible excuse for a human being for most of his life but on the other hand , his expulsion makes the front national much more electable . 
  i 'm surprisingly conflicted about this . 
  you ca n't really compare latvia and greece due to the fact that latvian authorities did not follow the initial imf [ recommendations  ( https://www.etui.org/publications2/policy-briefs/european-economic-employment-and-social-policy/does-austerity-work-after-all-the-case-of-latvia )  the imf entered latvia at the end of 2008 with a programme aiming to contain external and fiscal imbalances and to keep the exchange rate peg with the euro . 
  latvia , at that moment , was indeed hard hit by the financial crisis : the economy had gone through a housing boom with households facing a heavy foreign debt load expressed in euros and was registering a high current account deficit of 13 per cent of gdp . 
  foreign lenders ( mainly scandinavian banks ) were no longer willing to roll over loans , let alone to extend new credit to finance the recurring external deficit . 
  the imf identified the enormous fiscal policy challenges from the start , stating in a press statement of 19 december 2008 that the ` programme requires substantial fiscal tightening and a headline deficit target of less than 5 per cent of gdp in 2009 compared to a deficit of 12 per cent if no additional measures were taken ' . 
  the fiscal adjustment programme for latvia was indeed brutal and highly front-loaded : whereas the total fiscal adjustment package is reported to have amounted to 15 per cent of gdp over a period of three years , between 8 and 9 per cent of gdp was already squeezed out of the economy in the first year of the adjustment programme ( 2009 ) . 
  public sector wages in particular were hit very hard , with wage cuts ranging from between 16 to 26 per cent in administration , health and education . 
  in line with this huge fiscal squeeze , economic activity contracted in 2009 by close to one-fifth . 
  however , this deep recession was followed the next year by a stabilisation of economic activity , with some measure of growth reappearing in 2011 . 
  how should this consecutive chain of austerity , followed by recession , followed by growth be understood ? 
  does it mean that lagarde 's claim that painful austerity is the road to economic recovery might be correct after all ? 
   here , the several latvian programme reviews written by imf staff over the course of this period provide a revealing answer . 
  the first review , written at the end of 2009 , reads like a wakeup call . 
  over the course of that year , latvia had been hit by a double blow : exports had fallen by 15 per cent and domestic demand , also because of the huge 9 per cent gdp fiscal cut , had collapsed as well . 
  the imf was therefore looking at an economy in total shambles : gdp had contracted by 18 per cent , employment by 8 per cent and unemployment had doubled to 15 per cent . 
  meanwhile , the public deficit had exploded from 3.3 per cent in 2008 to 13 per cent of gdp in 2009 : fiscal cuts in the amount of 9 per cent of gdp had been implemented but had been more than offset by falling revenues and increasing public expenditure resulting from the collapse of economic activity . 
  fiscal cuts themselves were heavily responsible for dragging economic activity down . 
  on top of that , the imf review at the end of 2009 estimated that the 2010 deficit would be even worse , increasing to a record high of 18 per cent ( ! ), 
  of gdp . 
  the gap with the official deficit target of 8.5 per cent of gdp , as set by the ecofin council , was huge and implied another massive fiscal squeeze of 10 per cent of gdp or more . 
   at that moment , the imf started to have serious doubts ( point 28 ) : ` the massive fiscal contraction required would put additional pressure on output , with significant risk of a downward spiral ' . 
  in view of this concern , the imf actually relaxed the deficit target , allowing a 12 per cent deficit for 2010 instead of the european commission 's deficit target of 8.5 per cent of gdp . 
  this still represented an additional and huge fiscal cut of ( more than ) 6 per cent of gdp . 
  in practice , however , the 2010 fiscal ambitions were further and drastically revised downwards . 
  according to the second imf programme review , published mid - 2010 , the latvian government limited the 2010 fiscal cut to a net 2.5 per cent of gdp ( also thanks to a constitutional court ruling invalidating previous pension cuts in the amount of 1.5 per cent of gdp ) . 
  in the end , and according to the commission 's 2010 spring economic forecasts , the deficit hardly moved from 2009 to 2010 . 
  the imf again allowed all of this loosening of the austerity strategy , calling the 2010 budget a ` strong ' budget . 
  in other words , the story which the head of the imf is now spreading around in the media is far from the truth . 
  what happened in reality was exactly the opposite : instead of sticking to overambitious and rigid deficit targets , latvian authorities abandoned this policy of austerity and substantially loosened the fiscal straightjacket . 
  the consequence was that the economy ended its freefall and economic activity stabilised in the course of 2010 . 
  what would have happened , on the other hand , if the authorities had pursued the initial imf recommendation of a 6 per cent fiscal cut or , even worse , if they had tried to reach the ecofin deficit target by administering a lethal amputation of 10 per cent of gdp ? 
  in that case , the economy would surely have stayed in deep recession for the third year in a row . 
  this would also have resulted in a higher deficit than the targeted one , possibly leading to further cuts and even lower economic activity . 
  latvia , thanks to a ( rare ) moment of lucidity on the part of the imf allowing deficit target flexibility , was able to escape from the austerity trap . 
  edit : even if you consider austerity a success in the long term , countries who have devalued their currencies in order to spur growth in response to export rates have typically fared much better : http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2013/01/03/latvia-is-a-success-story-if-by-success-story-you-mean-disaster/,

  hopefully another anti-austerity party on the left gains more traction . 
  the last thing we on the left need is for the major voices of opposition to austerity to come from the far-right . 
  even if you ignore the facetious tone of the article , it 's still pretty disingenuous . 
  to say that corbyn supports hamas is at best hyperbolic , and at worse , a gross misrepresentation of what his foreign policy actually is .

  i 'm going to ignore you 're first two points , because it 's quite obvious that we 're going to go full circle , but i think it 's important to address your last paragraph because it 's very misleading , deliberately so i might add .

   wages are about to grow by 33 % considering that the recession has completely tanked real wage growth , it 's not too surprising : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22860320  this just shows a lack of understanding of expansionary fiscal consolidation and a refusal to accept that it 's very clearly working . 
  efc has major contractionary effects on domestic demand and gdp so i 'm not quite sure how one could attribute the current rate of gdp to efc .

  there is no legal obligation on behalf of employers to award their employees with a `` living wage '' . 
  the conservatives just gave everyone a 33 % pay rise only applies to those who live in london and considering the fact that is does not cover the standard of living of most londoners , it 's not particularly impressive , nor is it a `` living wage '' .

  if you read the article i linked , instead of ranting about a left of center newspaper geared towards upper middle class social democrats , you would know this . 
   you 're argument is that during the adjustment period before the living wage is fully implemented , some people wont be getting the full living wage . 
  no , my argument is that it 's not a living wage . 
  did you read what i wrote ? 
   and you 're suggesting an 8 % surcharge on profits is materially different to an 8 % tax on profits . 
  no , i 've explicitly stated that it 's a charge on profits but recognized the fact that it was applied with a major reduction in the banking levy . 
   temporary if you 're a conservative , perhaps , but if you do n't pander to their economic nonsense , it 's quite clear that the levy greatly leveled the playing field between what constituted established lenders and challenger banks . 
   cite the guardian the radical leftist political paper who happens to support the rather moderate yvette cooper ? 
  this is a joke , right ? 
  the `` living wage '' cameron speaks of is not a living wage . 
  on the contrary , the initial # 7.20 rate is below the # 7.85 rate outside london that experts calculate is now needed to survive and the # 9 rate by 2020 is less than the # 9.15 needed now in london due to renting and various other high costs . 
  not to mention the fact that it 's based on tax credit allowances that are being routinely cut under this conservative government . 
  edit :  extra 8 % corporate tax this is very disingenuous .

  i 'll give you nato , but he never said rt were objective . 
  you know , it 's been pretty right-wing for sometime . 
  this might surprise you , but corbyn has been a vocal supporter of lgbt rights long before it was popular to do so , so he 's rather impressive on social justice issues . 
  also , as another user pointed out , this is a right-wing newspaper deliberately taking his words out of context in order to present a sensationalised article portraying him in a negative light .
