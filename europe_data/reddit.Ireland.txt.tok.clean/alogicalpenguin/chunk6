  ] ( http://www.ceicdata.com/en/statistics/greece/nominal-gdp )  even if it were true , your conclusion does n't follow . 
  i. ... what ? 
  yes , it quite clearly does . 
   you 're wrong . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  first cpi does n't really factor in the growth rate of nominal gdp , it just measures changes in the price level of a mb of consumer goods and services purchased by households . 
  nominal gdp depends on a detraction of inflation at nominal periods . 
  once we examine said periods , [ average prices fall in both 2013 and 2014 .

  edit : i 'd appreciate if you could stop downvoting me , it just makes you look petty . 
  real gdp only increased due to the fact that nominal gdp continued to drop at a slower rate than average prices . 
  citing such growth as `` success '' is very misleading and i might add , deliberately disingenuous . 
   ( where they dropped a flag in 2007 ) . 
  [ reminds me of this .

  i 'd actually consider myself to the left of sinn f\u00e9in in many ways , so i 'm still hesitant about voting for them . 
  with that said , it 's quite clear that they 're the only feasible anti-austerity political party who have a chance of entering office and for that reason , i 'm supporting them in the next ge . 
  this thread should be interesting . 
  anyway , i 'm going to go with one of the more controversial answers , and vote sinn f\u00e9in . 
  no academic really takes the laffer curve seriously anymore . 
  quite frankly , it 's nonsense . 
  i suppose it could have been worse . 
  obviously the pronunciation will vary depending on the dialect , but it would generally sound something like this : `` knee knee-art ( or knee-nart ) guh kur le kay-la '' for a first attempt , it was n't too bad ( ;, 
   welsh close but no cigar , it 's actually a tongue twister in irish . 
  edit : if this is too difficult , just try this instead : n\u00ed neart go cur le ch\u00e9ile it 's more of a saying than a tongue twister , but the pronunciation is much easier . 
  i 'm sure another round of austerity measures will greatly improve both the manufacturing and banking sector .

  this is good news , but it 's important to note that this is n't the standard levels of energy usually generated by renewable sources , unfortunately . 
  we still have a long way to go in developing renewable energy technology that is actually sustainable . 
  are you seriously comparing refugees and migrants to criminals ? 
  for growth , you 're absolutely correct but in terms of total accumulation , gdp  gnp . 
  thanks for the correction though . 
  * lost growth the only reason gdp is growing at such a rate is due to the recession , and corporate tax laws that allow corporations to pay a minuscule amount of tax , which in turn increases our levels of national income . 
  it 's the predominant reason as to why our gdp and gnp are so different in terms of productivity . 
  the hive mind is n't fond of anyone who criticises the narrative that the institutions/troika are blameless . 
   i am describing a pattern that i have noticed about western commies . 
  that pattern does n't line up with reality when most major leftist parties are n't m-l .  here is a picture of a dumb commie girl from new york demonstrating in support of russian thugs , who would hang her for being american and black . 
  that sort of thing is quite common . 
  she may very well be a communist , but support for the actions of the current russian federation does not equate to support for a communist regime . 
  on the contrary , russia is one of the most oligarchical right-wing capitalist states imaginable . 
  so a single journalist is representative of all communists ? 
   and neither of which prevents people from belonging to multiple groups or moving from one group to another . 
  you think a child born into the slums of mumbai can simply , through hard work and determination , move up into the upper echelons of society that easily . 
   you can always make up a notion of class by which you can define any society as a class-society . 
  class is just a category , all societies are in someway defined by class . 
   yet in practice the social mobility in my country is among the highest in the world , and we do n't need communism for that . 
  due to tax redistribution and large scale social programs , most of which ca n't be carried out in the vast majority of countries . 
  the fact remain , income inequality on an international level has drastically increased , since the regan/thatcher era . 
   seumas milne a : he 's a journalist , and not a representative of any radical political parties . 
  b : no idea who he is , but apparently he is a member of the british labour party so he 's probably not as radical as you are portraying him to be . 
   hey , i already live in a classless society . 
  from a socialist perspective , class relates to the means of production . 
  from a sociological perspective , it relates to income levels . 
  either way , you live in a class based society . 
  [ classless  ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/classless ) : without social or economic classes : not grouping people according to their social or economic level : not connected to a particular social or economic class [ class  ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/class ) : a social stratum sharing basic economic , political , or cultural characteristics , and having the same social position  in which you confuse a party with an ideology . 
  i spoke of nazi party , now you changed it to nazi ideology . 
  those two are different things . 
  very well , banning the nazi party does not address the root problems causing people to vote for them . 
  the only major radical socialist parties here are trots , so i think you 're mistaken . 
   hey , i can play that game too : not all forms of fascism are the same some are n't , but most tend to base their ideology along racial grounds which is inherently racist and thus , should be discouraged on that basis . 
   and what a great goal that is . 
  if obtainable , a classless society would be a great goal . 
  personally , i think it 's a tad bit idealistic , but noble . 
   by that logic we should also not ban nazi parties provided they achieve their goal via democratic means . 
  we should n't . 
  banning nazism does n't deal with the root of the problem . 
   ` because the only ones that hated socialists more than even the nazis were the communists . 
  communists are socialists , and yes , there is a great deal of infighting among leftists . 
  what 's your point ? 
   they never spoke out for the socialists . 
  well , they spoke out for socialists who aligned with m-l dogma , but point taken . 
   but i bet not you nor your actress are ones to learn from that . 
  i 'm not sure what your implying . 
  for what it 's worth , i 'm neither a communist or revolutionary socialist . 
  i 'm a democratic socialist , but you probably do n't think there is a difference . 
  you seem to be the sort of person who thinks anyone who is to the left of hitler , is essentially a maoist . 
   soviet apologist i 'll bite , when did i dismiss the human rights abuses of the su ? 
   soviet apologism all the major modern leftist political parties in europe , with the exception of the kke , french communist party and portuguese communist party , were formed in conflict with the su , or formed after the collapse of the su . 
  ever hear of the left oppostion , or eurocommunism for that matter ? 
   they are tho . 
  do n't tell the trots or luxemburgists that . 
   moreover communism is inherently bad . 
  you have to be specific , this is n't an argument . 
  for example , i think planned economies are disastrous and anyone who defends them , is typically an ideologue . 
  many forms of communism are based on said model , some are not . 
  nonetheless , it 's an actual fucking critique . 
  saying , something `` is inherently bad '' is n't an argument . 
  if we 're being realistic , not all forms of communism are the same and insinuating they are , is disingenuous . 
  provided , they achieve their goal via democratic means , they should n't be banned . 
   all pictures nsfw / nswl i could just as easily post pictures of the vietnam war , and blame `` capitalism '' on behalf of the us . 
  it would n't change the fact that it 's a terrible argument , and that it does n't include any criticism of the economic model itself . 
   and by the way the quotation goes : nope , [ source  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_they_came_ ... ) nonetheless , the wording remains controversial , both in terms of its provenance , and the substance and order of the groups that are mentioned in its many versions . 
  while niem\u00f6ller 's published 1946 speeches mention communists , the incurably ill , jews or jehovah 's witnesses ( depending on which speech ) , and people in occupied countries , the 1955 text , a paraphrase by a german professor in an interview , lists communists , socialists , `` the schools , the press , the jews , and so on '' , and ends with `` the church '' . 
  based on the explanation given by niem\u00f6ller himself in 1976 , this refers to the german protestant ( ` evangelische ' ) church , and not to the german catholic church . 
  [ 1 ] however , as claimed by richard john neuhaus in the november 2001 issue of first things , when `` asked in 1971 about the correct version of the quote , niem\u00f6ller said he was not quite sure when he had said the famous words but , if people insist upon citing them , he preferred a version that listed ` the communists ' , ` the trade unionists ' , ` the jews ' , and ` me ' . 
  '' [ 5 ] however , historian harold marcuse could not verify that interview . 
  [ 1 ] rather , he found a 1976 interview in which niem\u00f6ller referred to a 1974 discussion with the general bishop of the lutheran church of slovakia .

  as does western style capitalism , or at least the move to advance said ideology in the face of soviet opposition did . 
  the united states of america supported various coups in latin america when the population attempted to elect various democratic socialists , european imperialism and colonialism resulted in countless genocides in africa and asia , corporations were established as fronts for us involvement in other nations affairs , belgian congolese imperialism was carried out , in part , due to corporate lobbying .
