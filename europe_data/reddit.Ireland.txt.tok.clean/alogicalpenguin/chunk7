  does the capitalist model of theses nations prove that all efforts to enact a capitalist system are flawed ? 
  of course not . 
  likewise , judging socialism in a similar manner is equally as unjust and wrong . 
  ideologies are complicated and nuanced . 
  china . 
  north korea . 
  laos . 
  not all communists are marxist-leninists and many , would completely disagree with your assertion that they are . 
  the party has been banned on the basis of ideology , not their use of symbolism . 
  and even if they were , it does not excuse the fact that this is a violation of the democratic will of a minority of ukrainians . 
  that 's a wonderful attitude to have in democratic society .

   we had a party that was pro nationalisation of the railways , anti nuke , anti tuition fees and anti war . 
  they did shit , as they always do . 
  6th in terms of votes . 
  i 'd argue that 's more to do with fptp and the uk electoral system in general . 
   most people ar n't socialists , the vast majority are centrist . 
  [ most people are more left-wing than people would expect ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-jeremy-corbyn-policies-that-most-people-actually-agree-with-10407148.html ) and yet , very few political parties represent views in relation to renationalising the railways , a 75 % top rate of tax on incomes over # 1m and rents controls on landlords , despite the public consensus . 
   libdems have been moving more central for years and now they 're irrelevant .

  a move to the right , and they loose what remains of their support in scotland , and a move to the left and they loose moderate tory voters in england . 
  either way , they 're screwed . 
  although , i 'm not gon na lie . 
  as a socialist , i agree with what most of corbyn has to say and i hope he does well in the labour leadership election , regardless of how the right-wing media may portray him as leader if elected . 
   does that mean that individual countries will be pushed into legalizing gay marriage ? 
  not necessarily `` marriage '' , but some form of legal recognition for coe members who must adhere to the european convention on human rights . 
  edit : to give you a more direct answer , member states still have the right to determine `` the exact status conferred [ to ] same-sex couples '' and the `` rights and obligations '' associated with said status , so no , unfortunately not . 
  the ruling pertains to legal recognition , not `` marriage . '', 
  regardless , it is a step in the right direction and it will certainly influence civil union partnerships in both italy , and other coe members . 
   because the anti-austerity parties got us here with big public spending . 
  but the ppd , ps and cds are n't anti-austerity parties . 
  could you ask the mods to sticky this thread so more people can contribute ? 
  as for my question , in ireland , spain and greece certain political parties have come to prominence on an anti-austerity ticket . 
  yet , this does n't seem to be the case for portugal . 
  why has n't portugal seen a rise in anti-austerity political parties in your view ? 
  [ justice minister alan shatter  ( http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/fifty-shades-of-alan-shatter-steamy-novel-by-justice-minister-referred-to-censor-29284409.html )  a raunchy novel written by justice minister alan shatter has been referred to the censorship office . 
   the herald has learned that censors are set to investigate whether laura : a story you will never forget is too `` obscene '' for irish readers . 
   the book , which the minister wrote 24 years ago , contains steamy sex scenes and centres around the troubled private life of an oireachtas member who is having an affair with his secretary .

  fuck you ! '', 
  he immediately apologised to the house for his use of unparliamentary language , which was criticised by deputy lucinda creighton , who demanded his suspension .

   thank you for your reply no problem . 
   will have to read a bit more into that then , i 'm afraid i know more about 20th century ireland than recent events - any link which you think might be helpful ? 
  it was a reference to the current political climate in which left-wing parties are becoming more popular than fianna f\u00e1il : http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/5/25/sinn-fein-recasts-irish-political-image.html http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/thousands-attend-dublin-rally-to-show-their-solidarity-with-greece-31351783.html http://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/thousands-march-in-anti-water-charges-protest-in-dublin-1.2257402  i think most of europe dabbled with fascism in the twenties and thirties i 'd agree , but i do n't think that should act as an excuse . 
  likewise , the fact that slavery was generally accepted in the early years after the american revolution , does not excuse the fact that slavery was morally wrong . 
   but truth be told that outside of italy fascism was never particularly adopted by the aristocracy for the most part , you 're correct . 
  though oddly enough wilhelm ( the german crown prince ) was rather fond of hitler , up until he realized that hitler had no intention of restoring the monarchy . 
  of course , at the time , the notion of divine rule had pretty much been replaced by ideas in relation to constitutional monarchies , so in reality , the royalty held little sway in the political world , regardless of their political views . 
   strong words , but was n't fine gael formed from members of the blueshirts , itself a fascist paramilitary organisation ? 
  indeed they were . 
   ireland is one of the few countries i can think of in which two of the parties which alternate are centre-right thanks to the financial crisis , not anymore . 
   de valera sent a condolences message after the death of hitler context is important . 
  he did so stressing irish neutrality and in no way , did he sympathize with the actions of hitler . 
  it was a matter of courtesy . 
  regardless , i passionately detest everything the man stood for , so i 'm not going to condone what he did . 
   i think they are of a particular strain of british conservationism which could in theory dabble with fascism but not for long , and especially not after the war began . 
  that 's a fair point . 
  hopefully he does . 
  give it five years , and greece will be on the verge of crisis again . 
  this agreement solves nothing . 
  this was lovely . 
  ca n't say i 'm surprised . 
  the british monarchy has some rather interesting ties to fascist leaders . 
  so much so that the duke of windsor , and former king edward viii openly defied government advice and met hitler in 1937 . 
  on top of this , many believe that he routinely conspired with members of the axis in releasing classified documents , but this is a little difficult to verify . 
  with all that said , you ca n't really blame a child who obviously has no idea about the political ramifications of what she is doing . 
  she 's clearly mimicking her parents , nothing else . 
   not actually , socialism and communism gives no shit about individuals and their aspirations many socialists would disagree with this . 
  socialism is just a social system of government in which the means of production is controlled in the commons , and according to communists , it is also the transitional phase to communism . 
  communism is defined as a system of government without either a monetary system or class system . 
  that 's it . 
  regardless of your political views , those tend to be the most accepted definitions . 
  i suppose post-scarcity communism would be the most apt description . 
   is quite different from communism but is something that communism may evolve into . 
  you mean socialism , no ? 
  was n't star trek pretty communist ?

   both economies are already better than they were at the peak of the bubble no , they are n't : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/latvia/gdp, 
  thanks !, 
   the greens had only one abstention . 
  judging from the graph , many more abstained . 
   i assume you mean the left . 
  nope , the left voted against the measure , generally speaking . 
   germany did violate maastricht in 2009 and 2010 due to the crisis , yes . 
  however this was not overspending because they were giving presents to their voters but because of an extraordinary difficult economic crisis . 
  surely , you could argue that 's what many in greece want now . 
  is n't it a tad bit hypocritical of the german government to mandate a policy , which they themselves did not follow ? 
   the point of the budget surplus is solely the fact that there wont be any debt repayments without one . 
  that 's probably the major reason behind it , but i would n't say it 's the sole reason . 
  regardless , it still does n't change the fact that a medium term surplus of 3.5 % is outlandish . 
   the point of reform is making your country better , more competitive and sustainable while improving the living conditions of your citizens . 
  but the reforms mandated in the memorandum are just going to continually contract the economy , reducing real income generated by both gross and real economic activity . 
   what matters is doing the right reforms i agree , i just do n't think these are the right reforms . 
  why so many abstentions for the greens ? 
  was the party whip applied ? 
   greece is borrowing from the creditor states at rates that most european countries can only dream of . 
  i do n't know about that , the maturity on the loans are great , but the interest could possibly be lower if eurobonds are adopted .
