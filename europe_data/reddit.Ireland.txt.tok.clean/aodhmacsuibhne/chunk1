i do , aye . 
  but i thought for a minute you might have brilliantly made mine and now i 'm a little disappointed !, 
  i agree . 
  you 're worthy of your namesake . 
  it takes big balls to say something so controversial . 
  i 'm sure you did n't mean to be a cunt but i can see why some people would think you were trying to be one . 
  i just think you 've confused nationalities , ethnicities and citizenship and were perhaps ignorant of the contents of the gfa . 
  not a crime and no reason to wish death upon you . 
  those dudes are asshats . 
  [ ye 'll need more than five to beat us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_irish_uprisings ) , 
  yeah , some people are dicks . 
  sorry about that . 
  but you should think before you rob people of their nationality in a neck of the woods where people in recent memory died for the expression of it . 
  i think so . 
  look again at the comment you replied to . 
  like i already told you , i live in donegal . 
  you are trying to argue that the people of northern ireland have n't the right to identify themselves and be accepted as irish . 
  you are refusing to accept them as irish . 
  that is grand , ye can if you like . 
  it is a bit mental and totally against the ideas in the good friday agreement . 
  you know donegal is in the republic , right ? 
  i do n't know how much * you * know about the united kingdom , but ireland is a part of it . 
  the northern ireland part of the name is the hint . 
  here is the relevent text from the gfa :  recognise the birthright of all the people of northern ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as irish or british , or both , as they may so choose , and accordingly confirm that their right to hold both british and irish citizenship is accepted by both governments and would not be affected by any future change in the status of northern ireland . 
  here is the important bit again just to highlight :  ** the birthright of all the people of northern ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as irish **, 
  ye would have had it too if there were n't so many taigs about !, 
  if scottish people can be british and scottish why can people not be irish and northern irish ? 
  what , borders aside is the difference between an irishman and a northern irishman ? 
  are they distinct ethnic groups ? 
   collins 's role during the war of independence led directly to the irish republic . 
  would it not be a little bit more accurate to say that his role [ led directly to the free state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-irish_treaty ) and that [ john a. costello being annoyed by some canadians at a dinner party led directly to the republic ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_ireland_act_1948#introduction_of_the_bill ), 
  they are n't all that fond of us up here and it shows .

  if you move to tyrone and raise your kids there are they suddenly not irish ? 
  you have a really strange and uncommon view of this . 
  are scottish people not in fact scottish but british ? 
  did sudanese people suddenly stop existing to be replaced by a near identical but different set of north and south sudanese people ? 
  actually irish people live in a great many different jurisdictions . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_people it is apparently a difficult concept for you . 
  irish is an ethnic group and lines on a map do not determine to which ethnic group you belong . 
  i 'm from donegal , mate . 
  you can say i 'm northern irish all you like and you may be geographically correct in that i live in the geographic north , but it makes me no less irish than you are . 
  derry is up the road from me . 
  i have more in common with the people of derry than i have with you so what gives you the right to split us into separate groups but claim me for your own ? 
  i feel it is rich that a fella from the ghalltacht gets to decide who is and who is n't irish . 
  where are you from , lad ? 
  nevermind that other cunt . 
  he does n't speak for the lot of us . 
  i 'm from donegal . 
  to borrow and butcher that phrase of hearney 's , we 're closer to derry than drumcondra . 
  just up the road from [ this ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sunday-life/revealed-the-massive-bill-for-policing-twaddell-protest-34225267.html ) . 
   loyalists set up the `` permanent '' camp in 2013 after orangemen were banned by the parades commission from marching past the ardoyne on their way home from that years twelfth of july celebrations . 
  they guided them to maturity with tough love . 
  german culture is older than that , dude . 
  edited to add : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanic_peoples, 
  german culture is older than american culture . 
  you do n't understand . 
  not voting for your ones is letting them ones win . 
  if you had have read a bit further you might have noticed this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_isles_naming_dispute, 
  the train stain has been a hotspot for sexual assault-disguised pick pocket since 2013 i read . 
  the events were expected even if the scale was n't . 
  ireland is and has been very backwards about women . 
  its funny , what he says about germany is exactly true of my experience working in ireland , while my experience of germany is the opposite . 
  granted i 'm talking rural ireland and urban germany so that might account for some of it . 
  pardon my ignorance . 
  i 'm only familiar with the part in germany where plattdeutsch seems much more common and seemed to fit your description . 
  i assume if they have no interest in groningen they 'd hardly have an interest in east frisia ? 
  when you say west friesland i think you mean ostfriesland ? 
  i 've got irish/english/french on mine . 
  they offered education and opportunities . 
  i doubt his preference was slavery . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:far-right_political_parties_by_country ) you go . 
  incorrect . 
  reactionary describes a position that seeks a return to the * [ status quo ante ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reactionary ) * , not the * status quo * . 
  it exactly means someone that wants to return to the way things were before there were immigrants . 
  as for extreme , there have been a great many racially-motivated attacks and rather than people expressing sympathy with the victims or blaming the culprits , people are blaming the chancellor of germany for being too nice to them . 
  that seems a bit extreme to me . 
  extreme is totally the word for it . 
  this is not the sort of reactionary reaction i expected when i opened these comments . 
  we live in interesting times . 
  it looks more to me like the people in here are blaming the big , bad boogey-chancellor for violent , reactionary hate-crimes . 
  sweet jesus , when did / r/european leak ? 
  the comments in here are crazy . 
  maybe in wales but it could potentially be very different in the north of ireland depending on border arrangements . 
  do you really have to ? 
  seems pretty obvious to me . 
  life imprisonment is expensive too if you do n't force them to do labour while imprisoned . 
  if it is possible to rehabilitate in cases like this is a whole other topic , but assuming it was would n't it be a much better option than a life sentence ? 
  the dup have used the petition of concern mechanism five times to block same-sex marriage in the north of ireland . 
  ridiculous . 
  what sort of reception would [ this t-shirt ] ( http://www.sinnfeinbookshop.com/viva-le-quince-brigada/ ) have in today 's spain ? 
  say instead of an anti-immigrant , neo-nazi hatefest instead it was a greenpeace , save the dolphins protest or whatever then . 
  do you think a man would have gotten his head kicked in by violent nazis at that ? 
  honestly , you sound ridiculous . 
  of course far right violence is related to racial issues . 
  it is a defining attribute of the perpetrators ' ideology . 
  i 'm sure people would be frothing at the bit to pin the death on the whole religion of islam if it were an islamic extremist instead of a nordic one . 
  and what point are you even trying to make here ? 
  they should n't protest racism , racism is blameless and fine ?
