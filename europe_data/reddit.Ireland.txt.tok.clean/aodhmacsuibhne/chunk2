  radicalise the moderates like in four lions . 
  you 're a willfuly obtuse fucking numpty if you do n't see why people would hold an anti-racism demo after a neo-nazi murders someone at a neo-nazi rally , whatever their skin colour . 
  i really do n't understand the point you 're trying to make . 
  you did n't say that but you said this :  i suspect race might not have played a role in the assualt . 
  if it was n't for racism there would be no rally . 
  if it was n't for the rally there 'd be no assault . 
  yeah , i 'm sure the neo-nazi rally had nothing to do with race at all . 
  says in the article he was a finnish national . 
  not sure it makes a difference what the skin colour of the victim is . 
  neo-nazis killed a man . 
  what ? 
  there was no border in 1801 . 
  and to this day ireland is not a part of great britain . 
  do you mean dutch protestant invasion during the `` glorious revolution '' ? 
  or scottish jacobite invasion ? 
  there has never been a catholic invasion of england . 
  even if you count the spanish armada that only ever managed to invade the atlantic , that ai n't a catholic invasion . 
  they did n't want to put in `` british war crimes '', 
  opposite of everything i 've read about it .

   fascinating that this comment is now ` controversial ' . 
  i do n't exactly see where i said anything even remotely untrue here ... an irishman would never say ` oi guv ' . 
   the republic is often times shortened to just ireland in europe . 
  derry is not in the ireland that ops flair relates to which one could easily confuse . 
  i refuse to believe you 're being anything other than wilfully obtuse . 
  ireland refers primarily to the island of ireland . 
  the names of the two polities on the island derive from this . 
  it is n't a shortened name name of the republic at all . 
  i would n't mind if you had stepped in to point out that it was in the six counties as you seem to think you did . 
  but you said it was n't in ireland . 
   as for the british isles all you have to do is search for it on reddit and / r/ireland to see irish people do n't take kindly to the term . 
  i am well aware of this but i do n't see how it supports your point . 
  most people who insist on londonderry and northern ireland by citing political borders and royal charters , ignoring national ( irish ) and international coequal convention , paradoxically insist on the term british isles because of national ( british ) coequal convention . 
  to sum up my position , call all these things whatever you like , but do n't try to tell me the island of ireland stops at the border and that donegal is a peninsula . 
  that is just thick . 
   point out derry is in northern ireland not quite . 
  you said this :  if anyone wants to visit it someday it 's not in ireland . 
  which is blatantly incorrect . 
  when called on this you start on a rant of whataboutery going on about wars and golfs . 
  so much for parity of esteem . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_isles i was really hoping you would bring this up . 
  which is it then ? 
  you ca n't say you must call it the british isles , it is a geographic term and you ca n't call it ireland , even though it is a geographic term at the same time . 
  mutually incompatible positions . 
  where is here for you ? 
  derry is an hour from me and i 've never seen anyone feel the need to correct someone using the geographic name of the island ireland . 
  ireland as a geographic term is common everywhere . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ireland_ ( disambiguation ), 
   i was referring to calling northern ireland `` ireland '' outside of political context . 
   * ireland *  is an island , comprising northern ireland and the irish republic . 
  we should no longer use ulster as a synonym for northern ireland ( one reason is that northern ireland has six counties whereas ulster has nine ) though `` the province '' remains acceptable on second reference . 
  [ bbc style guide ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/radio_newsroom/1099593.stm#i ), 
   people from dublin would say ireland . 
  we only say northern ireland when referring to something political that needs to be differentiated from the republic . 
  this is a fact .

   i do n't .

  ] ( http://www.irishnews.com/news/2016/09/06/news/-londonderry-name-to-be-lost-in-westminster-boundary-overhaul-682304/ ) the sensitivity on this issue seems to only come from the unionist community and only those that do n't actually live in derry . 
  we call that [ whataboutery ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/whataboutery ) here . 
  my point is n't that journalists call the far-right patriots , but that the far-right call themselves patriots . 
   who the fuck are britain first ? 
  rhetorical question ? 
  i just literally linked you a rake of information about them . 
  they 're a more neo-nazi-ish ukip linked to the assassination of jo cox .

  and why did the uk offer above average terms ? 
  from the same report as above :  the government agreed to provide a bilateral loan to ireland because it is in the uk 's national interest that ireland has a successful economy and a stable banking system . 
  the links between our financial systems , particularly in northern ireland , mean that ** there was a strong economic case to provide financial assistance to ireland ** . 
  by being part of the international financial package , the uk indirectly supported the very many businesses across the uk that trade with ireland . 
  self-interest .
