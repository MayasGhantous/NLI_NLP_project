  shame you did n't have more money to throw into the pot at the time it happened . 
  making a good bit in interest off the $ 3.4 bn you lent us but we borrowed $ 85bn in total . 
  you could be making a huge fortune right now off our backs instead of a modest one . 
  first of all , a loan is an arrangement that benefits the issuer more than the recipient . 
  do you think the bank is your mate for letting you mortgage your house ? 
  so yeah , thanks for letting us pay you loads of interest , i guess ? 
   [ # 273,825,613.71 ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/bilateral-loan-to-ireland ) that is how much in pure profit your timely loan has netted the uk out of the pockets of irish taxpayers so far . 
  do n't try and present a business arrangement that took money out of my pocket as some sort of benevolent imperialism . 
  who do you suggest to lead us proud gaels from the yoke of the sassanch then so ? 
  that is a terrible idea . 
  ye 're already poised to take a [ unilateral dump on the treaty that just a few decades ago took the gun out of irish politics ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/european-convention-on-human-rights-snub-would-tear-up-good-friday-agreement-34657809.html ) and now you 're on about fucking annexing us . 
  leave us alone , ffs . 
  i know . 
  i was merely agreeing with a part of what he wrote . 
  he is completely right to say that this whole thing is stupid as fuck . 
  it is stupid !, 
  the fact that we have morality police going about telling people how to dress is fucking daft . 
  i await the pictures of armed policemen forcing a rabbi to strip in public . 
  bridal veils are not compatible with the values of the french republic . 
  ban them from the beaches !, 
  that 'll learn them good !, 
  you 've inspired me to depress myself with my own country 's figures . 
  here we have [ 16 % youth unemployment and 7.8 % overall unemployment . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/youth-unemployment-rate-rises-to-16-in-july-1.2743573 ) and that is even with so many folk [ leaving steadily since the economic crash . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/generation-emigration/emigration-of-irish-nationals-falls-13-with-35-300-leaving-in-year-1.2329252 ), 
  i think saying they 're not in education , employment or training is less obnoxious than saying they 're lazy shites laying about on their arses . 
  alternatives ? 
  i 'm proud of that too but do n't become complacent . 
  we have our share of wankers on this island who 'd love to see finger-giving policies implemented . 
  it is really kind of disgusting . 
  even if you do accept the logic that burkinis are repressive and women would n't wear them without pressure from males then you have effectively collaborated with the extremists to ban these same oppressed people from the beach . 
  makes zero sense to me . 
  cheers dude !, 
  do you also agree with the [ dress act 1746 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dress_act_1746 ) that banned tartan ? 
  [ merci !, 
  mras seem to spend more time complaining about feminism and woman 's rights than advocating for men 's rights . 
  check out / r/menslib for a less misogynist rights platform . 
  you can always just [ abstain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abstentionism ) . 
  talk about a false equivalence !, 
  a neo nazi shot up a concert in your country last week and you think a bit of cake is just as crazy . 
  when did she become leader of die linke ? 
  is n't it katja kipping and bernd riexinger ? 
  i 'd love to hear what gladstone would think of may threatening to reform the lords over her wee brexit bill when he had to put up with this shit from the tories back in the day . 
  this explains it a bit . 
  we own the [ lingua franca ] ( http://imgur.com/t21ehua ) now . 
  or as they called it back in the 1630s , [ bastard spanish . 
  blaming all feminists for the silliest of them is as daft as blaming all non-feminists for the worst out of the red pill and the like . 
  you got a source for the swedish government whining about superhero movies ? 
  i get a proper root whenever i think of the dissolution of the united kingdom . 
  what , do you mean when the irish tax payer bailed out the banks ? 
  42 % of the cost was paid by the irish . 
  9000 per person . 
  if you 're going to be cunts about our borders i 'd like that back please . 
   i understand asking for more involvement that is the gist of the article . 
  do you think that it contains harsh criticism ? 
  i did n't see too much at all . 
  just statements that we should have more involvement . 
  we 've been criticising the fuck out the uk much , much more harshly than this since the vote . 
  i 'd like to point out that we in ireland and in the uk opposition have been trying to remind them long enough ourselves without you guys . 
  you make it sound like we 've been sitting here twiddling our thumbs while this was going on with remarks like that . 
  it was sex chat spam . 
  i reported it . 
  [ i found a picture of it . 
  ] ( http://us.123rf.com/450wm/eyematrix/eyematrix1508/eyematrix150800024/44285397-uk-pebble-united-kingdom-union-jack-flag-pebble.jpg?ver=6 ), 
  yeah , but with one in the customs union and the other out it gets messy . 
  the important part though is n't that , it is that the checks will be between the two islands instead of along miles and miles of countryside that many people cross multiple times a day . 
  a border on the island would be a disaster and a manned border would be both a provocation and invitation to dissident republicans . 
  they had to decide the colour and firmness of their brexit . 
  michael portillo seems to think it is to some extent . 
   former mp and deputy leader of the conservative party michael portillo told newstalk breakfast on tuesday morning that he did not anticipate the restoration of a hard border between northern ireland and the republic . 
  people and goods will continue to move freely between north and south and great britain will impose controls between northern ireland and great britain , he said . 
  i can understand perfectly voting for labour in wales if only to spite the tories . 
  less , ` oh , look at me , i 'm english ' and more ` fuck the party of thatcher , we used to have mines ! ', 
  oh , so is n't you but the ` mainstream media ' that is calling us proles ? 
  looks to me more like the paper of record in my country is accurately repeating the words of a politician from another country , but whatever . 
  are you calling me a filthy prole for posting it or everyone else one for reading it ? 
  not a good way to bring people around to your point of view i 'd think . 
  seems a sound choice . 
  if he does n't know what aleppo is in 2016 , i doubt there is much hope of him knowing what a pristina is in 2020 . 
  we let serbia pick the next us president ? 
  should n't have to remind them that they 're co-guarantors of the gfa . 
  ` you ' is a poultry farmer from an analogy . 
  i 'll try another one to clarify my meaning : if you 're dead set on committing a bewildering act of self-harm you should have the decency to do it in a way that does n't also kill your neighbours . 
  really ? 
  this is from today : [ brexit to send uk tumbling down world economic league table , worrying new analysis shows ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-economic-impact-economy-league-table-a7495411.html ), 
  that is one thing . 
  they got to have a say in the matter and all . 
  just because the turkeys voted for christmas does n't mean you should also slaughter all the chickens too . 
  i find it amusing that he goes on at length about the history of the dutch and freedom of speech when you can go to jail for insulting the king . 
  more like every austrian person i disagree with who runs an extreme right wing political party founded by nazis and adopts symbols of nazism and apes their rhetoric has some stuff in common with hitler . 
  i do n't think that is unfair . 
  `` sometimes rapists are brown . 
  vote nazi . '', 
  this logic hurts my brain . 
  are you saying it is a disaster that the president of austria is n't a nazi ? 
  or it is a disaster that so many people voted for a nazi ? 
  a lot of people do . 
  i understand theirs better than yours . 
  it is amazing to me how quick the euro-right can swing from outright misogynist to faux-feminist outrage and right back to victim-blaming as it suits them . 
  not trying to be dramatic .
