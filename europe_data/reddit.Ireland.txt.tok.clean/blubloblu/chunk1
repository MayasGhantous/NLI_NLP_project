stop your moaning , it was twenty five celsius in dublin today, 
  notably the flag of saudi arabia never flies at half mast . 
   the government has no job dictating the bloody packaging ( aside from obvious sanitation issues ) of private products . 
  you favour no regulation of labelling on food ? 
  which would end if scotland leaves the uk and remains in the eu . 
  ireland : probably not a great deal of support ... 
  ireland has 11 meps ( about the same population per mep as slovakia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apportionment_in_the_european_parliament#2014_amendment ) and had one of the highest turnouts ... 
  i had a a choice of voting for an irish or a french mep . 
  i feel my vote has more influence as one of 417,372 rather than one of 886,935 . 
  am i right in reading that the mep elections were stand-alone in slovakia , a couple months after the presidentials ? 
  that would be a major factor . 
  the icelandic [ al\u00feingi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/althing ) is possibly the oldest parliament in the world . 
  i think it 's great . 
  it 's intuitive for voters , all they have to do is list preferences . 
  electronic counting of the votes would speed things up . 
  it would n't be a great fit in other countries because we do n't have the likes of the bnp or fn ; if they were to emerge in ireland , stv would give them a big advantage . 
  france is shown in nuts 2 and ireland has subdivisions smaller than nuts 3 ( lau1 ) shown . 
  our seanad ( senate ) has 60 seats . 
  eleven appointed by the taoiseach ( prime minister ) , six elected by graduates of some universities , and the remainder by members of the d\u00e1il ( lower house of parliament ) and local councillors . 
  it has very few powers , it can not veto a bill ( only delay it ) . 
  it is generally seen to be an undemocratic waiting room for failed or aspiring politicians . 
  however , a referendum last year to abolish it was rejected 51.7 % to 48.3 % . 
  * stv : single transferable vote . 
  most constituencies have three to five seats . 
  your [ ballot paper ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q23qcn3.jpg ) lists all the candidates for that constituency . 
  you vote for each candidate in order of preference 1,2,3 etc. 
  after the first count , if anyone has the quota ' ( valid votes/number of seats ) + 1 ' , they are elected . 
  any votes in excess of the quota are redistributed according to the next preference . 
  the lowest candidate is eliminated and their votes redistributed as well . 
  this takes a long time to count ( can be days ) , but results in a more proportional result compared to first-past-the-post . 
  vote-splitting is less of an issue and you 're not constrained by party lines . 
   south ireland has no culture nor language different to england . 
  err ... 
  do they not cross your name off a roll in the netherlands ? 
   whynotboth.gif the fine/sentence i quoted are from irish legislation , so i 'd imagine ireland if that 's where you live . 
  some eu countries allow their citizens to vote abroad . 
  french citizens living abroad can vote for the paris region euro-constituency . 
  i 'm a french-irish dual national living in ireland . 
  i could vote in both , but it 's illegal . 
  non-irish eu passport holders sign [ a form ] ( http://www.checktheregister.ie/appforms/form%20ep1-statutory%20declaration%20[english]-website.pdf ) when they register to vote to allow authorities to cross-reference electoral rolls . 
  as an irish passport holder , i can fall through this loophole . 
  i 'm not sure if i would get caught , but the fine is over $ 3000 or two years imprisonment , probably not worth trying . 
  got ta love ireland 's sweet sweet stv . 
  http://independentforum.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/irl-ballot-paper.jpg write 1 beside your first choice and continue 2,3 as much as you want . 
  no fear of your vote being wasted . 
  i think encouraging widespread public key cryptography is a good thing . 
  free 's $ 2/month for 2hours calls ( french numbers + landlines in 100 countries ) , unlimited sms , and 50mb of 3g/4g internet . 
  and they even shame you for not speaking your first national language !, 
  how about including voting systems ? 
  got ta love ireland 's sweet sweet pr-stv, 
  we have local elections on the same date in ireland . 
  i actually quite like the abstract art ones . 
  bit of 90s retro in your wallet every day, 
  [ that 's the gist of this marriage equality video made in ireland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uldasryglq ), 
  cigarette smuggling is already big business as it is . 
  piggybacks on o2 , 48 is owned by telefonica . 
  i 'm not sure what the story is after three bought o2 . 
  i was in france this year and was amazed at the plans offered by free mobile . 
  $ 2/month for unlimited sms and two hours of calls including international . 
  in ireland the cheapest i found is $ 10/month and that 's restricted to 18-22 year olds . 
  open market would be nice . 
  not that much of a stretch : irish students learn irish , english , and a european language , typically french , spanish , german or italian . 
  there 's a great facebook page , although it has n't been updated since april : [ ugly irish houses ] ( https://www.facebook.com/uglyirishhouses ), 
  ireland : 4 coins spain : 2 coins france : 1 coin germany : 1 coin italy : 1 coin, 
  what kind of transaction ? 
  what about the * quart d'heure vaudois * ? 
  is that white area in the southwest of france the landes forest ? 
  they 'll just move outside the eu then . 
  anyone from cork ? 
  i 'd be interested to see how switzerland would measure up . 
  they 've approved the first article of the bill , which defines marriage as being between either same or different sex couples . 
  the bill as a whole will be voted on the 12th of february . 
  good news , and it 's expected the rest will also pass seeing as the government support it . 
  almost there . 
  poor switzerland , reminds me of ghadaffi . 
  i was just clarifying ninety6days ' comment . 
  / r/ireland does cater for the whole island . 
  you can add another 1,810,863 people if you count the north , making 6,399,115 . 
  4,588,252 according to census 2011 . 
  pretty accurate . 
  the irish are teetotallers . 
  of course , judging by the referendum results . 
  the pro-life airtime seems to be taken up mostly by pretty much everyone in this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o17hbfowvhw . 
  the secular indigenous anti-abortion people are a lot less outspoken . 
  abortion has been illegal in ireland since at least 1861 , that 's the date of the law currently still in force . 
  after roe - v - wade in the us , pro-life people in ireland were worried that the 1861 law could be changed , so they campaigned for a referendum to get the ban on abortion into the constitution : harder to change . 
  in 1983 , 67 % voted in favour of our eighth amendment which enshrined an ** equal right to life of the unborn and the mother . 
  ** ( there have been a few issues related to allowing information and travel to the uk for abortion ) in 1992 , the attorney general attempted to stop a fourteen year old rape victim travelling to the uk for an abortion . 
  the resulting supreme court judgement , the `` x case '' , interpreted the eighth amendment as allowing abortion in cases where there was a `` a real and substantial risk '' to the life of the mother , including suicide . 
  following that ruling , an amendment was put to the people to specifically remove suicide as grounds for abortion , this was rejected in 1992 , 65 % . 
  a similar referendum in 2002 was also rejected , 50.42 % . 
  despite the 1992 ruling , and the votes of the people , there has been no legislation passed ( in twenty years ! ), 
  to allow abortion in those circumstances . 
  the current government might pass something in the new year . 
  if it does , it will likely be very narrow . 
  it will still be a long way before abortion will be allowed in cases of rape , fatal fetal abnormalities or risk to the health ( as opposed to the life ) of the mother . 
  the reality of the situation is that every week , over a hundred irish women travel to the uk and other countries for terminations . 
  it allows politicians to ignore the issue . 
  well , they obviously would n't be backed by evangelical christians . 
  so , who is said to back them ?
