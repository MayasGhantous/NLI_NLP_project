  [ not an official explanation - a redditor explanation ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1qp820/sky_is_purple_again_lads/cdf3u1s ) . 
  this is from another thread about the pink/purple skies recently . 
  [ you forgot the weird sky we 've been having lately ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rumzwpj.jpg ), 
  well that 's my entertainment sorted for the next few evenings ... 
  you forgot rue du chat qui p\u00eache . 
  the street of the cat which fishes . 
  i used to use it in school and read it in some detective stories written for boys . 
  but that was about 35 years ago .

  it 's on my mind . 
  claire or [ clare ] ( http://www.irishgaelictranslator.com/countyclare/ ) in ireland ? 
  looks like a harpist to me and not an angel . 
  the harp being the national symbol of ireland and all that . 
  how do you cope with someone called saoirse ? 
  ufrustratedbro 's flair flag says finland which is why i searched in finnish to translate . 
  yeah , you will experience rip-off ireland . 
  cool , mine arrived too . 
  ( the pic of o'connell st in dublin at night ), 
  because the pluralisation rules for irish are part of the third secret of fatima . 
  that 's because ireland is the sponge of europe . 
  nearly all the rain that comes off the atlantic is absorbed by the irish sponge first and whatever escapes the sponge is deposited around the rest of europe . 
  all those feckin ' sun-bronzed europeans should get down on their knees and thank us . 
   a small european country that 's down to the subjectivity of the adjectives . 
  the order : is more subjective  less subjective  factual + noun/object . 
  ` european ' is factual but ` small ' is subjective so european is placed closer to the noun/object . 
  another example is a ` new big blue plastic ball ' . 
  it 's definitely plastic , it 's blue but what shade of blue ? 
  it 's big but compared to what ? 
  it 's new but it may not be brand new and never used or it could be new to the owner of the ball .

  when i lived in paris my local was the auld alliance and witnessed this [ good natured madness ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp7sxeuke9s ) , the pub got closed down that night but s.g. the original owner was a friend of the head of the commissariat de police in paris who happens to be married to a scottish woman . 
  the next day three very sheepish parisian cops showed up and apologised for having the bar shut down that night , the police also closed down the street to traffic the next day and the local franprix supermarket on place st. paul was emptied of booze . 
  a car parked outside the auld had its roof destroyed by the tartan army and bagpipers playing on top of it but fair fucks to the scots as they cobbled together and funded money to repair it . 
  better than rangers ' banter . 
  i shall concede that proper haggis , neeps and tatties are fucking delicious , can we all just sit around a table and get drunk together and sing anti-english songs ? 
  irn-bru is liquid bubblegum tasting foul chemical tasting filth . 
  keep it inside your borders you dirty teuchtars . 
  the scots will deep-fry the lorry and eat it . 
  do n't fuck with a tank . 
  you should n't keep condoms in your wallet as body heat will perish the latex . 
  what the hell was your mother doing looking in your wallet anyway ? 
   our country is young , but the older generations are still very backward in their thinking , especially in the west . 
  what a sweeping generalisation , please give more credit to those of us well over the age of 20 . 
  i 'd love a reliable source all the statistics you 've quoted . 
  as i said , i 'm 48 and most of my friends and peers would be as liberal and open to equality as i am . 
  i 'm 48 and i voted yes on both referenda . 
  take your ageism elsewhere please . 
  they were n't available here in ireland 40 years ago , my pilot uncle used to bring them back for us from the us .

  i 've heard `` fumer comme un bataillion '' but never `` un turc '' . 
  not knocking your comment at all but [ contraception has been freely available since ' 92 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/contraception_in_the_republic_of_ireland )  the health ( family planning ) ( amendment ) act , 1992 [ 8 ] repealed section 4 of the 1979 act , as amended in 1985 , and continued the provision of contraceptives without prescription , allowing sale to individuals over the age of 17 . 
  [ martin mcguinnes advocating death to those who `` go over to the other side '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch5u8yboyie ), 
  true . 
  i despair of ireland sometimes although irish society is slowly changing , same sex civil partnerships ( but not marriage ) were legalised recently . 
  in ireland abortion is still a very emotive subject with so called pro-lifers displaying grisly posters of what they allege to be aborted foetuses on the main streets in full view . 
  the catholic church has lost a huge amount of its grip on irish society over the last 15 years or so . 
  things are changing . 
  it 's a common misconception that st. patrick brought christianity to ireland . 
  it was in fact [ palladius ] ( http://www.yourirish.com/palladius ),

  here in ireland we have three bins , household ( unrecyclable ) waste , recyclable waste and garden waste . 
  cool !, 
  i 've got a cheap ryanair flight for next weekend . 
  i have all the polish i 'll ever need now !, 
  how the hell can i pronounce that and what does it mean ? 
  i went to the `` biggest polish supermarket in dublin '' this afternoon and asked if they had them . 
  the surly shelf packer said no . 
  dammit , i want to eat one of those !, 
  i 'm on a mission !!, 
  [ i 've just found a polish bakery in dublin ] ( http://goireland.about.com/od/eatanddrinkindublin/gr/party-cake-polish-bakery-and-cafe-158-capel-street-dublin.htm ) i 'll go there tomorrow . 
  maybe i 'll try one of the polish shops here in dublin to see if i can find one . 
  for ireland take a look at the archived posts on r/irishtourism . 
  you 'll find tonnes of info from locals and visitors alike . 
  how presumptious of you !,

  after the two week suspension he was reinstated . 
  this was during the time when aer lingus were messing around with staff 's pensions and al were trying to get rid of staff through `` downsizing '' . 
  my uncle is now retired and has a good pension . 
  they were n't my students . 
  i mainly taught back office staff , not flight crew . 
  as i said in my comment it was n't their ( ryanair 's ) fault , what pissed me off was paying for the taxi ride with the two girls . 
  i think that ~ ~ budget ~ ~ airlines only carry an extra 45 mins fuel from their destination airport judging by comments in this thread . 
  scarey shit nevertheless . 
  sounds right , my memory is a bit fuzzy , i read the article about 7 years ago . 
  the verb ` demand ' is pretty strong though . 
  i 'm a smoker and i welcome the bans in different countries except when it 's cold and raining . 
  i also enjoy ` smirting ' with other smokers .
