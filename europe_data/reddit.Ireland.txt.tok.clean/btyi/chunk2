  whats hilarious is the uk will pay in the end . 
  right on time for it \u00b4 s weekly reposting . 
  [ * 8 days ago * ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bl8fj/a_new_study_shows_that_every_european_country_has/ ) [ * 22 days ago * ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/68ywaz/map_how_easily_white_europeans_associate_black/ ), 
  no , i had a big lunch . 
  queen le pen . 
  * shudder *, 
  as opposed to amercans , whose leader just gave billions worth of weapons to the main funder of isis . 
   reduce it in the future in 80 years ? 
  it does n't stop at 2 or 3 generations . . you would have to round up all immigrants going back 3 generations and throw them out to change anything this way , is this a solution ? 
  the problem is here to stay regardless unless it is resolved at its source , which is not immigrants but extremist ideology . 
  i have no idea . 
  its frustrating . 
  exactly , banning immigrants wo n't do shit , this needs to be rooted out within the communities and mosques . 
  block all borders now and we will still be dealing with this stuff 30 years from now . 
  now let 's wait a few days to find out the person who committed the attack is english and is only a 3rd generation immigrant . 
  i never said ignore the problem , just do n't dwell on the tragedy with banners and hashtags . 
  tackle the problem head on with emotions in check . 
  as an irishman who knows what it is to learn a practically unused language since childhood , this wo n't work . 
  the main vector for language learning and proficiency is use in everyday life . 
  teaching a few esperanto phrases and having no one to speak to them with is pointless . 
  this is especially difficult for children aswell , they simply will just speak the language of their peers . 
  english is and will continue to be the lingua franca for simple logistical reasons . 
  it is already the language of science , international business trade and the largest worldwide media . 
  it would be more useful if everyone just continued learning english like they are . 
  irony is lost on them, 
  nothing should be changed , life should go on as normal . 
  solidarity in moving on . 
  attacks like this are designed to break society , the strongest response is to minimize its impact . 
  a tragedy happened , condolences to the families but no one benefits from dwelling on it . 
  just [ spamming ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/gerardpb2/submitted/ ) this sub at this point . 
  she is handy to have around . 
  trot her around every few years to show the people how bad it could get . 
  she \u00b4 s a living breathing cautionary tale . 
  nope , did n't work, 
  thats my point though that it is unfortunate that people like le pen are taking over the anti-eu argument and polluting it with their other shit . 
  important conversations should be had about your concerns but they are drowned out by the likes of le pen and garage . . 
  [ enjoy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_ireland_ ( 1801 -- 1923 ), 
  show me one who does ? 
  more propaganda, 
  stuff like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afe-regxkqu ), 
  the thing is that she ( and all other anti-eu people ) do n't actually have any idea what they want . 
  their only stance is to be antagonistic , they have no vision for any positive change besides random buzzphrases like \u00a8 frexit \u00a8 \u00a8 no euro \u00a8 \u00a8 immigrants are the reason you are not happy \u00a8 \u00a8 sovereignty \u00a8 . 
  which is a shame , if they had a coherent plan on what to change , people might have a look . 
  immigration is a hot topic right now and we need to discuss it but when a person with ties to white supremacists and nazi sympathisers is the one shouting the loudest , well ... its not the best person to carry that torch is it ? 
  great, 
  dont count on it . 
  well done lads, 
  and the rest of spain decades ago ... catalans are not special , every corner of spain suffered under franco , to use it as an example of victimhood today is laughable . 
  this extremist agenda is explicitly transparent in its false narrative . 
  it fools no one . 
  apples and oranges . 
   [ the political movement began in 1922 when francesc maci\u00e0 founded estat catal\u00e0 ( catalan state ) . 
  in 1931 , estat catal\u00e0 and other parties formed esquerra republicana de catalunya ( republican left of catalonia ; erc ) , which won a dramatic victory in the municipal elections of that year . 
  maci\u00e0 proclaimed a catalan republic , but after negotiations with the leaders of the new spanish republic , he instead accepted autonomy within the spanish state . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_independence )  the modern independence movement began when the 2006 statute of autonomy , which had been agreed with the spanish government and passed by a referendum in catalonia , was challenged in the spanish high court of justice , which ruled that a large number of articles were unconstitutional , or were to be interpreted restrictively . 
  they had a republic and joined the spanish state willingly , after franco they reclaimed their autonomy . 
  now they all of a sudden do n't accept that they had joined the state willingly . 
  history can not be rewritten easily . 
  if pedro sanchez is radical what does that make pablo iglesias !, 
   currently, 
  history is the judge not me . 
  do not compare what ireland went through ( famine , destruction of culture , serfdom , partition ) for 800 years , to the free democratic assembly that is currently enjoyed in catalonia . 
  we were culturally oppressed with * no * representation in any parliament let alone our own . 
  catalonia just look like spoiled children pissed because they have to help poorer regions of spain . 
  incredibly undemocratic idea . 
  what about the people in catalonia who do n't want to leave spain ? 
  just because you legally ca n't hold a referendum does n't mean you get to ignore the population who prefer the status quo and may be the majority !, 
  politics in catalonia are being hijacked by opportunists . 
  why do separatists think the eu will come save them . 
  the eu is 28 ( 27 ) countries that decide together in unity , spain being one of them will never allow catalonia to join and the rest of the eu will follow their lead . 
  lively, 
  all of them combined do n't even wield ~ ~ a quarter ~ ~ a sixteenth of his power though . . 
  im sure one of the tent poles of the eu ( spain ) will just be fine with all of this ... never mind their veto but it will just become a mini brexit . 
  \u00a8 catalonia can not be better outside spain than in \u00a8 . 
  the rest of europe wo n't be coming to catalonia 's aid either , about 5 other countries will veto catalonia on the basis of limiting their own countries independence movements . 
  wishful thinking is great for inspiration but it does n't figure too much into reality . 
  sure, 
  by 2050 the only people living in ireland will be the skeleton staff of multinational companies based there for tax reasons . 
  always the pridesmaid . . 
  you can live and survive but you have no human right to enjoy it . 
  ^ antiquated ^ geographical ^ term ^ = / = ^ autonomous ^ community, 
  ^ ^ , spain, 
  strong and stable, 
  more like tea-shyook, 
  nice source, 
  and the dominos continue to fall ... 
  id rather trust a newspaper than trumps word . 
  eu not europe . 
  law & order : cdu, 
  you are taking this way too personally . 
  go for a bike ride or do some spice or something . 
  of course it wo n't but come on now the u.k. was the biggest barrier to it . 
  it will move along at the same speed but will just hit less roadblocks . 
  you 're beginning to sound nervous . 
  then enjoy, 
  ireland is part of the eu , you do n't trade with individual countries you trade with the block . 
  these are the rules . 
  just because you do n't like them does n't mean they are not there . 
  we have to put a vote on anything that would require a change to our constitution . 
  this would fall under that .
