  it is said to be an idea , but i believe he machinations are in process . 
  that 's not how this works , and your misunderstanding of that is the pile of shit i 'm talking about . 
  they are pissed at your decision . 
  but what can they do , time to move on . 
  come to think of it though , mcdonald 's over here only ever promotes it as 100 % irish beef so i guess they will be grand . 
  from [ website ] ( http://www.mcdonalds.ie/iehome/food/food_quality/about_our_food/our_beef.html ) : * we are the largest purchaser of irish beef by volume every year . 
  we purchase 40,000 tonnes of beef which is then exported to other european markets , meaning that every year one in five hamburgers sold in mcdonald 's in europe is of irish origin . 
  every mcdonald 's beef product sold in ireland is made from 100 % pure irish beef . 
  our constitution is quite robust and requires a referendum for any change . 
  ughh * the irish republican army ( 1917 -- 22 ) ( in later years , known as the `` old '' ira ) , recognised by the first d\u00e1il as the legitimate army of the irish republic in april 1921 , split into pro-treaty forces ( the national army , also known as the government forces or the regulars ) and anti-treaty forces ( the republicans , irregulars or executive forces ) after the treaty . 
  * is not the same group as : * the irish republican army ( 1922 -- 69 ) , the anti-treaty ira which fought and lost the civil war and which thereafter refused to recognise either the irish free state or northern ireland , deeming them both to be creations of british imperialism . 
  it existed in one form or another for over 40 years before splitting in 1969 . 
  have sinn fein ever been in power in government in the republic during the troubles ? 
  political party = / = government . 
  if the plan of an eu army is put on the table , the irish people will have to have a referendum . 
  ours is the final say . 
  his opinion is his own but it has no sway with the actual decision . 
  then good luck . 
  the ira are a paramilitary group with no state affiliation . 
  the british army killed civilians on behalf of the crown . 
  do you see a difference there ? 
  the irish government did n't ... 
  the british ? 
  your \u00b4 s had better punctuation . 
  he has no say on the matter . 
  careful !, 
  there are bexiteers around these parts . 
   with two words . 
  three words . 
  all for it, 
  she has just retreated to mordor to gather her strength . 
  of carse boi !, 
  but the roi was never in the u.k. ? 
  2019 ca n't come soon enough . 
  i guess it 's settled then, 
  supply and demand in action . 
  we have no choice , britain gave us this pile of shit to deal with . 
  it 's time to finally untwine our economies then . 
  the imf & ecb ? 
  the u.k. 
  contribution ? 
  do n't think that was charity , it was to prop up u.k. investments . 
  not to help the irish . 
  while father ted is a good shout , [ hardy bucks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq-g2ugag44 ) is a more modern examination of where we are right now . 
  [ hardy bucks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq-g2ugag44 ), 
  of course, 
  schengen is possible due to ireland \u00b4 s current statues . 
  i love watching brits on their current path . 
  we got our potato bros backs . 
  they may have a stiff upper lip , but their skin is thinner than paper . 
  is brexit more clear to people now ? 
  it was all just britain feeling left out and now they are going home and trying to take the ball ( that we all payed for ) with them . 
  the nordic willies , flaccid as usual . 
  australian culture exchange, 
  i would think these workers already support a certain far right party, 
  flawed logic . 
  never negotiate with terrorists, 
  catalans have to be pitied here , their politicians use independence as a tool to get elected . 
  it ai n't happening without an uprising , but in the modern world that would not go down well with the rest of europe . 
  hardly hypocritical when it 's to argue fairness in personal expression not shutting someone down . .

   how this will impact the uk-anus border remains to be seen . 
  * \u00a8 after several years of careful digestion the british public has resoundingly voted to reapply for membership to the european union . \u00a8 *, 
   how this will impact the uk-uranus border * \u00a8 after a shocking turn of events britain seems to have voted to disappear entirely up its own ass . 
  pm may relays that britain has always been a bastion of seeking out new frontiers and looks forward to the challenge ahead . \u00a8 *, 
   how this will impact the uk-ireland border * \u00a8 obviously we ca n't deal with this issue until we are actually up in the air , but this is n't about borders , it \u00b4 s about britains innate place off this planet in deep space where it belongs . \u00a8 *, 
  i look forward to the day britons vote to leave britain .

  the pinnacle of human evolution . 
  damn brexiarchy . 
  apparently we should be ignoring they are leaving and act like nothing happened . 
  it 's like when you do something incredibly embarrassing like a fart on a train and you use all your energy to ignore what you did . 
  our greatest export , after young people . 
  he 's about the right height at least . 
  bit of the napoleon about him . 
  that is correct . 
  piss leakofnations ?

  why did you have to bring facts to a circlejerk . 
  aye , we should let them drown alright . 
  * third, 
  this what you voted for france !, 
  nobody is a stretch but a large majority do n't . 
  `` britains * lead * '', 
  you know what to do, 
  i guess they 're still salty about france . 
  it 's nazis , go figure . 
  if only they would go out and vote . 
  they may as well promise the fucking moon , they are not getting in with corbyn .
