  when is turkey going to join the commonwealth ? 
  come to ireland , you probably have some distant relations here anyway . 
  who ? 
  \u00a8 what \u00b4 s that ? 
  a muslim in handcuffs and a black bag over his head ? 
  no worries . 
  off to cuba are ya ? \u00a8, 
  if he was anti-russian sanctions we would be hearing about how awesome he is for banging his high school teacher . 
  stop telling people what to do and feel . 
  just because their thoughts are upsetting you does n't mean they should be silent to protect your feelings . 
  dare i say you sound like a bit of a snowflake . 
  what, 
  any excuse, 
  french presidential election 2027 : le pen vs le pen - 93 % abstention rate, 
  when can we expect her telegraph column ? 
   why would we want to get involved in any future wars ? 
  as mentioned earlier , we 're not gon na be much help . 
  let 's just stay neutral and leave the guns to the big boys . 
  if we are benefiting from the eu we should be helping protect it no matter how small our contribution . 
  it may be meagre but any help would be appreciated and show our solidarity . 
  also a joint european army would be for defence not war . 
  i would imagine any declaration of war would take years with each member state having to agree . 
  so much positivity in the uk right now . 
  does n't matter how bad it is or is n't , every politician on the planet now has plausible deniability due to these techniques being exposed . 
  abstention will always be the loser because it did n't even take part . 
  ~ ~ never forget the 48 % ~ ~ ** never forget the 47.5 % **, 
  you see that in your crystal bollocks ? 
   brittish refugees i think you mean ex-pats, 
  the order and the lack of britain in that list is hilarious, 
  [ second picture ] ( http://www.military.ie/typo3temp/pics/45e5111563.jpg ) sums up our strike-force nicely . 
  thanks for that by the way . 
  this faux outrage at an editorial piece is n't helping the fight against actual fake news . 
  its more about our ability to whore ourselves out to multinational companies with our low tax rate and eu market access . 
  we need to ... address this issue . 
  im not sure our 2 kites and shared coastguard helicopter will be of any use to nato . 
  2 separate questions . 
  this is after austerity . 
  hes not who we need right now . 
  maybe electricity subsidies ? 
  its the no red tape i 'd be worried about , without that the companies would take the peoples power . 
  it could have been beautiful, 
  ha , i liked the way you started off warm and reconciliatory , but suddenly went down to hard business . 
  not bad , this is much better than shitty memes . 
  it seems whenever wikileaks pipes up in the press it is to the benefit of a right wing politician . 
  my dear independent , how you have fallen . 
  this would be the moment dad takes the dog to the shed . 
  as a form psychological analysis into insanity , i \u00b4 d love to see your comments . 
  so much could be learned from the inane wailings of a reddit poster . 
  please sir , you \u00b4 re distressing the other guests . 
  their tops are the colours of the tricolore , just the wrong order . 
  its like a return of the old shit \u00a8 in soviet union \u00a8 jokes . 
  \u00a8 in federal russia , bad news is good news ! \u00a8, 
  sir , i think you have had too much salt . 
  [ aye ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heat_death_of_the_universe ), 
   prayforfrance no thanks . 
  it is a secular state . 
  none of that religious fanaticism . 
  id bet his grandad used to dress up as a woman to get out of being drafted . 
  ... laughing at the uk \u00b4 s expense, 
  when scotland leaves, 
  you had a case ? 
  so many ifs, 
  [ the iraq war directly led to the syrian conflict and in turn the syrian refugee crisis ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/blogs/middleeast/2015/09/iraq-war-root-europe-refugee-crisis-150908151855527.html ), 
  [ american-led intervention in syria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american-led_intervention_in_syria ), 
  unfortunately they are the loudest voice of the leave contingent . 
  i shall enjoy that, 
  50 years \u00a8 has the eu collapsed yet ? \u00a8, 
  * nearly she * nearly * won aswell . 
  almost !, 
  i \u00b4 m on my third glass of water here my mouth is so dry . 
  why do you think we are so pro-eu !, 
  bringing our averages up is of national ~ ~ impotence ~ ~ ** importance ** . 
  too right . 
  spanish upstairs , venezuelan fiesta downstairs !, 
  whats your other half ? 
  so we can work out an average . 
  they are great . 
  europe has needed some opposition to unite us for a while . 
  let them keep coming and vomit their bullshit . 
  its been collapsing for 30 years ... but , its still here . 
  slow and steady wins the race . 
  the eu will grow and grow . 
  applies to a lot really . 
  american war . . floods europe with refugees . 
  our willies are bigger though . 
  [ facts to back up claim ] ( https://brobible.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/average-penis-size-by-country3.jpg ), 
  imagine not having to deal with any of that, 
  you are not german, 
  username checks out, 
  no bias at all . 
  looks like the british propaganda machine is firing up today . 
  too much eu positivity going around . 
  they thought they started a revolution , but in reality they are still waiting for the guests to arrive and its 10 past midnight . 
  1st order of business , take your guns !, 
  i do n't doubt they will dealt with . 
  it is clear by these recent elections and referendums the worry of the people . 
  head in the sand wo n't work anymore . 
  they do n't realise they give us life by shitposting here . 
  uniting us against a common idiot . 
  ok ok i concede , i overreacted .
