  its just the dust has n't even settled and its already back to concern and foreboding . 
  you \u00b4 re from ireland you tit . 
  why do you sound like a brexiter . 
  your allegiance is suspect . 
  nice and salty, 
  putin is merkel \u00b4 s bitch . 
  time for a top-up on those sanctions . 
  this an opinion piece not a direct editorial from the guardian themselves . 
  did n't take long for the anti-eu article, 
  no worries , you 've got a tough road ahead but in a few years , you will be back rebuilding a better country . 
  im not attacking you . 
  americans are great . 
  i was actually defending you  getting cheeto crumbs and mountain dew spittle all over his basement floor . 
  better but ... i \u00b4 m not sure there is an answer to this question !, 
  no thanks, 
  to be fair to the americans they never had any culture to begin with . 
  \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af look at my post history , ive posted it all over the_d and they are up voting it . 
  look at the link ... no one seems to look at it ... 
  i 'm pro macron by the way .

  well she was 7/1 on paddy power yesterday and is now 15/1 so your millage may vary . 
  people dropping big amounts on her , would sway the odds . 
  not true , thats why you vote with a blank paper . 
  why is she in a children 's playground ? 
  what are they trying to convey ? 
  you know it 's quality journalism when the writer of the article is named after a 90 's movie villian . 
  what a source, 
  i guess so . 
  are you triggered ? 
  criminals love beurocracy, 
  is this a return of the holy roma empire ? 
  damn socialists and their sociopathy !, 
  got ta sell that unstable eu agenda . 
  we 're falling apart apparently !,

  do n't worry they wo n't harm anyone . 
  not really , this was their shot . 
  far right parties are gaining mainstream success the world over , this was their moment to capitalise . 
  the south will rise again !, 
  you can be damn sure there will be russian names in the metadata of those pdfs and spreadsheets being sent to le pen . 
  thanks !, 
  the alt left is a mysterious creature unlike its opposite alt right it does n't like the spotlight and prefers quiet conversations about peace in our time .

  good one . 
  good one . 
  it 's the alt-left shitposting again . 
  may have to try this out . 
  can you name any president anywhere ? 
  [ flegs !, 
  it was 6 / 1 last week . 
  great work !, 
  as president he can not be prosecuted . 
  i do n't see any irony . 
  maybe they could block steven seagal . . that would send a message . 
  salt as far as the eye can see . 
  let me guess , $ 350 million a week . 
  wearing her labour colours . 
   sanitizing theres only so much you can polish a shit .

  the three marketeers, 
  i would n't get too comfortable , you \u00b4 re government has a chip on their shoulder regarding russia . 
  it would n't surprise me if you were sent to the front . 
  brace yourselves , the putrumbots are awake . 
  [ `` i told the garda that i did not want to include this as i had not personally been offended by fry 's comments - i added that i simply believed that the comments made by fry on rt\u00c9 were criminal blasphemy and that i was doing my civic duty by reporting a crime . 
  '' ] ( http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/garda-launch-blasphemy-probe-into-stephen-fry-comments-on-the-meaning-of-life-35684262.html ), 
  the full story is actually more interesting . 
  the guy who is making the complaint is n't doing it because he believes in blasphemy . 
  he is doing it to highlight how stupid the law is and that we need to get rid of it . 
  using well loved steven fry should give it the headroom it needs to be discussed in a decent capacity . 
  that would be hilarious, 
  damn , by the sounds of it they want to make their own eu and be best friends with germany . 
  was n't this the plot of skyfall ? 
  that is some fine work . 
  it might go down well / r/ukpolitics though . 
  every election ever is , when you get down to it . 
  everyone hates all politicians . 
  american election playbook . 
  voter fraud is something that has always been on the american agenda during elections . 
  in europe it has never been an issue . 
  that has n't even been proven yet . 
  macron \u00b4 s team stated it could be a possibility that there are fake documents but they did n't confirm they have seen any ( how could they , 9 gigs is a lot to go through and they had to make a statement before midnight ), 
   and there is democracy in a bag . 
  on the other hand is he the most qualified of the 2 candidates ? 
  it seems that is what really matters in the end . 
  if marine le pen can get to where she is with all of her history , what does it matter about macron . 
  next news cycle , he will already be president . 
  the worlds eyes will be on germany . 
  it will be up to him to prove his worth . 
  the english tabloids seem to love her already . 
  i foresee le pen getting embroiled in this leaking thing . 
  once the details of corroberation come out , we will see connections just like the us election . 
  hopefully the french bring back some revolutionary backbone and nip this in the bud . 
  they need vindication that their alt-shite agenda is growing . 
  once the wave crashes it will recede , they know this . 
  at the moment it is about claiming as much territory as possible and then clinging to it for dear life .
