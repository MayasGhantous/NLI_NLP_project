  sooner or later the pendulum will swing back the other way , you can fool people for a while but eventually the truth of the matter prevails . 
  edit : downvotes proving my point, 
  we \u00b4 re still coming for your guns, 
  maybe they have nothing to hide . 
  i foresee the final verdict on these documents being a vindication of macron being pretty clean . 
  are you triggered ? 
   shills yes , russian/alt-right ones, 
  they are literally msm . 
  most of them seem to be gone to bed now . 
  this place was a shitshow last night . 
  who ? 
  [ you sure ? 
  ] ( http://cdn.images.dailystar.co.uk/dynamic/1/photos/367000/620x/kim-jong-un-600873.jpg ), 
  its like walking through a sea of shit . 
  first they came for the disabled ... and i said nothing ... then they came for z-list celebrities ... and i said no more ukraine !, 
  the truth hurts, 
  [ with love ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dmkjxdhg9li/hqdefault.jpg ), 
  i guarantee there \u00b4 s more terrorists in your country than mine . 
  what about marines fraud and nazi past ? 
  cant wait to hear his daily schedule !, 
  would be hilarious if the macron camp deliberately leaked these to give the russians some busy work . 
  wow , an opinion piece . 
  block all subscribers without eu ip addresses ? 
  ^ ^ i \u00b4 m ^ ^ kidding, 
  even if you hit a goldmine what do you think will happen ? 
  once he is president then thats that . 
  there will be no amount of shit you sling at him that will remove him from office . 
  but by all means enjoy pretending to be a hacker for a few hours . 
  im sure the french public ca n't wait to hear about the daily goings on of government . 
  too little too late . 
   is that a bad thing ? 
  nope , my comment was made in anticipation , not dread . 
   trickle out why not just drop them all ? 
  maybe its because it takes time to fabricate documents . 
  i believe it would be along the lines of \u00a8 como ? \u00a8, 
  unless they \u00b4 re nazis . 
  why does everyone seem to want the eu to fail ? 
  there 's war too, 
  he should take a look at one of our school history books , it might be an eye opener for him . 
  i 'm sure / u/mr-oldfart was n't being literal , i mean realistically nigel has had at least one friend in his life however fleeting . 
  he meant he has no friends in ireland which he does n't . 
  thats not a value . 
  keep trying . 
  we share more values with the eu than the uk and us combined . 
  just because we speak the same language does not mean we are kindred spirits . 
  he 's the first thing i think of when i \u00b4 m taking a shit . 
  leave it how your found it though ... 
  they wo n't matter in a few years when the only food stuff available will be many mountains of salt . 
  its not about which wing you reside , its about values . 
  ours align more with the eus than yours . 
  ye but he is not trying convince any congolese to join him on an expedition of destruction . 
  you \u00b4 re grasping at air . 
  and the u.k. gives a shit about us ? 
  the fact that ireland was n't even mentioned once in your brexit nonsense shows which side your bread is buttered . 
  misery loves company, 
  everywhere is full of fat people and gays , yes even russia . 
  . . you know what , forget the voluntary union of cooperation . 
  your english seems pretty damn good to me . 
  we replaced one overlord with another . 
  need money to make money . 
  [ here \u00b4 s a taster ] ( https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56a1b48e2399a32e6171d4c3/56a2941976d99ce49d7588b1/583e4d9cebbd1ac1680278e4/1480485111734/cxvqog9uoaacrhb-1.jpg-large.jpeg?format=1000w ) edit : running an alt-right organisation for \u00a8 [ awakened europeans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/identity_evropa ) \u00a8 but its based and fully membered by americans . 
  ( tiny blonde boy at the front is who macron is looking to sue ), 
  save some money at least . 
  but i think they like the good cop , bad cop routine too much . 
  federalisation is getting closer everyday . 
  be careful with your violins, 
  its a helping of t_retards latest effort . 
  they must have just finished high school for the day . 
  they look like american frogs though . 
  french frogs look like [ this ] ( http://michelesworld.net/dmm2/frog/frog/french1.jpg ), 
  why are they boiling american frogs ? 
  i smell an annexation . 
  and this is why you are lost . 
  we do n't . 
  we go to great lengths to preserve the language though so it is our first pick in the eu , knowing the uks was english . 
  then we will come for your guns . 
  never thought i \u00b4 d see the day where mighty britain plays the victim card . 
  [ no respect ] ( http://media.tcm.ie/media/images/e/endakennythumbsuptocameraelection2011pa_large.jpg ), 
  have n't we come to the conclusion that they are just feelings and not facts . 
  whats so strange about russians being involved ? 
  they have a big interest in le pen winning . 
  no one cares , you are literally wasting your time . 
  not all politicians can be as smooth as [ mr. bang bang ] ( http://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/287846/original/?width=630&amp;version=287846 ), 
  as opposed to ? 
  of course they will create them but all that has happened is now people do n't believe everything they hear immediately they require confirmation which blows fake leaks out of the water because eventually they are disproven . 
  basically the boy who cried fake news . 
  people are n't idiots . 
  im not talking about americans , nearly every european right wing party has seen a dip after trump got into office . 
  the great thing about trump is he 's the high water mark for this kind of politics in the western world . 
  he 's only a few months in and already everyone has a bad taste in their mouth . 
  looks like fake news and fake leaks are beginning to lose their steam . 
  welcome back normal facts . 
  same amount of white people but with some colour, 
  i hardly think you and me talking about it on reddit is changing any narrative let alone news worthy . 
  one article does not equal a national discussion . 
  if you brought this up anywhere publicly in ireland you would be laughed at . 
  not even taking into account eu market access . 
  multinationals are keeping this country afloat , ca n't imagine any staying without full access to the eu market . 
  yeah , i think this may be it . 
  also south americans get a bit of a hard time but definitely gypsies are persona non grata .
