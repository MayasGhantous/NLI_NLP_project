it 's my first time , i can only say that we 're keeping costs down by staying in hostels and planning to buy a lot of our own food ( as opposed to eating out ) check out the raildude website for all things interrail , i found it to be a great resource :3, 
  oh thank you !, 
  as an interrailer , i 'm a broke student with limited budget . 
  also , limited time , 3 days to be exact . 
  what do you think i should see/do ? 
  i 'm overwhelmed by all the tourist sights to see and do !, 
  that 's a tricky one mate !, 
  if you budget allows , i would highly recommend a guided tour ( as a former barmaid in a busy pub in dublin city centre , i know what tourists like and do n't like haha ! ), 
  as navigating on public transport alone can be tough . 
  http://www.cliffsofmohertours.ie/ ^ if you can bare the 6.50 am start from dublin ( you can have sleep on the bus haha ) . 
  apart from a lovely tour of the cliffs of moher , it includes a stop in castle ( or two i think ! ), 
  and lunch in one of my favourite pubs . 
  you make it back to dublin by 7ish , great time to grab a bite to eat and a pint ( . . or ten haha ), 
  i posted this in [ r/ireland ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland ) some while back for someone looking for some tips , - check out christ church cathedral & dublin castle for the medieval period and loads of viking fun !, 
  christ church cathedral is the resting place of strongbow , norman ruler of a lot of ireland , and it also provides access to the oldest functioning structure in dublin , the 1,000 year old crypt . 
  plus there 's some pretty cool ( and old ) art in the national gallery on merrion sq/nassau street . 
  - temple bar is full of tourists - go there if you like but remember it 's just a show put on for visitors . 
  you 'll find a lot more locals in the warren of streets between george 's st and south williams st. 
  in fact you could have an unbelievable night on south william st alone - port house for tapas dinner , grogan 's for a pint and pygmalion or south william st venue for a bit of a dance . 
  - the majority of food in dublin is shite and nothing special at all . 
  we have the freshest ( and best agricultural ) food in the world but we get a french or german man to cook it . 
  if you see places in and around dublin city ( read : temple bar ) offering ` stews , ceoil and craic ' , forget about it . 
  find a nice restaurant and eat a decently cooked salmon or steak . 
  that 's really what it 's all about . 
  check out lovin ' dublin , the best dublin food review resource and eat like a local !, 
  - howth is only a half hour dart ( coastal rail system ) ride away from dublin and offers some on ireland 's nicest hiking views . 
  take a stroll , have some beshoff 's fish and chips on the pier , and finish the night off in the bloody stream pub -- http://howthpathways.com/loopwalks.html - one touristy place that is worth going to is leo burdock 's chipper ( fish and chip shop ) . 
  this place has won award after award for having the best fish and chips in the country . 
  it is located beside christchurch . 
  prepare yourself for a queue . . burdock 's is super popular with dublin natives as well as tourists . 
  i disagree . 
  the fact that she accomplishes her goals , and maintains a consistent style , makes her a competent author . 
  labeling her as a great writer is vastly premature , and discounts the work of others who have earned the distinction of greatness . 
  i 'm sorry , but mass-market appeal is not a reliable barometer for literary greatness . 
  yeah , ironic from a bunch calling themselves the dignity project . 
  my curiosity got the better of me and i wondered what the dignity project was ( according to scotland 's charity regulator , it 's still active . ), 
  they claim their aim is . . * `` the advancement of the christian religion in africa by furthering the work of god and particularly by teaching the aforementioned children christianity and christian beliefs '' * now , i 'm not a fan of these christian charities who receive shady funding and use the poverty and desperation of the world 's poorest people to further their own religion ( you know , ` we 'll only feed you if join jesus ) but that 's a debate for another day . 
  what really annoys me is the hypocrisy of these people . 
  where 's the tolerance that they claim to promote ? 
  so much for dignity , there was nothing dignified in that abusive tweet . 
  sad to see such ignorance and outright abuse directed at jk rowling . 
  debate is very important , nobody should be bullied into silence by ** either ** side . 
  interrailing from london to france and then italy !, 
  i ca n't wait , esp for italy . 
  i visited italy a lot as a kid and i miss it so much . 
  travel plan looks like : dublin to london , london to paris , paris to nice , nice to venice , venice to rome . 
  compare how he was dealt with to how british citizens in wales are dealt with when they choose to speak their language . 
  disgraceful carry on . 
  as an irish citizen , he chose to speak irish . 
  open to correction , but i imagine that 's his right . 
  ahh , father ted . 
  okay , i can only talk for rome . 
  my favourite , semi-unknown places to eat were ; * enoteca corsi : this wine shop also does business as a working-class restaurant . 
  a daily menu is thrown on the table , with dozens of roman specialties like meat-stuffed zucchini , osso buco , and thick and delicious faro soup . 
  do n't miss the gnocchi on thursdays . 
  * forno dei campo dei fior : this is where the locals go for tasty and inexpensive pizza/panini . 
  you simply point to the pizza you want and tell them or show them how large of a slice you 'd like . 
  then you can grab a drink out of the fridge and pay at the register . 
  you wo n't believe how cheap it is , especially when you taste how good it is !, 
  * l'asino d'oro : okay , this place is known having pricey dinners but at lunchtime , the fixed menu is one of the best deals in town !, 
  at $ 12 you 'll get three full courses , plus wine and water , ( it 's cash-only at lunch and make sure you reserve ahead ) . 
  the pumpkin soup and ravioli was my favourite . 
  damn . 
  i 'm hungry now . 
  i 'm a dubliner , i ca n't give great advice about places outside of dublin . . sorry ; __ ; * check out christ church cathedral & dublin castle for the medieval period and loads of viking fun !,

  enjoy !, 
  i hate stew and worse yet , coddle ( a stew type dish that dubliners would make to use up leftovers ) . 
  even if i was n't a vegetarian , i 'd still tell you that stew is basically overcooked meat , undercooked potatoes in what looks like dirty dish water . . yuck i have a soft spot for [ colcannon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colcannon ) , esp when my mam makes it . 
  in ireland ? 
  well considering the irish government is the biggest eu ass licking jokes ever , they plaster the good ol' eu flag where ever they got the funding . 
  all those shiny new motorways we got have these embarrassing reminders everywhere that european union money covered the road/improvement or whatever . 
  so while my taxes where bailing out greedy irish bankers , the eu paid for new roads ? 
  what . 
  when i walk into my college , i see the irish and eu flag and reminders everywhere outside various shiny new classrooms/computer labs ` the eu paid for this !!!!!!! ', 
  ; ___ ; it 's not a negative reflection of the eu it 's a negative reflection of a country that ca n't stand on it 's own two bleedin legs !, 
  ireland ** bad ** * most public schools ( referred to as ` national schools ' ) are still run by catholic church orders . 
  that said , the staff of the school would be lay people/normal teachers . . but the school itself would be under the control of a religious order . 
  * a lot of irish people have a very utilitarian view of education and do n't see the ` point ' of learning certain subjects . 
  in contrast to other countries with better educational outcomes there is a widespread contempt for the humanities . 
  ` arts ' is spat out almost as an insult , yet the majority of those who work in the education system are humanities graduates . 
  * the use of the irish language is declining and the education system is failing irish speakers !!, 
  ** sidenote ** i went to a special type of school , called a ` gaelscoil ' where we were educated through gaelic only . 
  gaelscoils are not very common , 95 % of schools speak english and only do an hour of irish a day . 
  but i did french , history , geography , art ect all through gaelic .
