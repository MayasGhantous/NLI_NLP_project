i just now realised i was n't on / r/vexillology, 
  also , they 're [ not just played in ireland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_gaelic_games_clubs_outside_ireland ), 
  technically , poland still can not into space . 
   want their country to evolve along the lines of a first world european country case in point - romania has the fastest internet in europe . 
   he became the first ( and to this day remains the only ) polish national in space ...  miros\u0142aw hermaszewski was born into a polish family in [ ... ] reichskommissariat ukraine , in present day - ukraine, 
  not as much as a chinese place or african place or whatever , such as along parnell street . 
  actually , the reason poles are generally liked by ireland 's working class is an interesting bit of cultural oddity . 
  during the celtic tiger years there was tonnes of construction going on in ireland and our working class were busily engaged in trying to do as little as possible while getting paid for it . 
  on site . 
  the poles in ireland also enjoyed this particular profession , while also enjoying a drink and having a familiar caustic dry wit . 
  this caused the irish construction workers and the polish construction workers to find themselves in bars together learning swear words in each others ' languages ( kurwa ! ) . 
  it also lead to them giving out about their foreman at length , queuing together for breakfast rolls from spar at 8am , and various other activities engaged in by construction workers . 
  during these activities they got to know each other and made friends . 
  and that is why your average unemployed working class man in ireland has a lot of time for the poles . 
  because they 're basically the same people except with weird russiany kind of accents , a fondness for good vodka and good looking girlfriends . 
  i know , because i was there at the time . 
  on site . 
  doing as little as possible and clambering for early-lates and overtime at 20 + yoyos an hour , while watching poles put away large quantities of clear smelly spirits after work and gawking at the women that would come in to drag them home when ~ ~ they ~ ~ i had drank too much . 
  in irish it would be * albain go br\u00e1ch * and would sound very similar . 
  they would also lose huge swathes of their agriculture and manufacturing industries . 
  plus not only are the majority of eastern ukrainians in favor of staying part of ukraine , [ even the russian speakers are . 
  ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/05/08/new-poll-shows-eastern-ukraines-separatists-are-wrong/ ) . 
  and somewhere a robin red breast sheds a single tear . 
  what might be a more realistic proposal is to make a european network , much like the sfw porn network and others . 
  this would require large scale cooperation among all the country specific subs as well as the above mentioned independent subs . 
  thus , as we know , if we start today we might finish in 25 years . 
  well in the case of ireland , i think it is quite clear and has been for some time that it would be political suicide for any government official to do anything supportive of israel . 
  i suppose these sorts of rallies would serve to reinforce that , aside from whatever specific demands they are making . 
  all flight paths originating in europe are authorised by eurocontrol . 
  the area that this plane was flying in ( and presumably lots of other planes over the last week since this [ buk system ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buk_missile_system ) got into the russian seperatists ' hands ) was restricted by ukrainian authorities up to fl320 or 32,000 feet , which the plane was above ( being at fl330 ) . 
  commercial jets very often fly over war zones . 
  where they are and are n't allowed to fly is a matter for air traffic control to manage ( though of course they can make the decision themselves not to fly over an area even if it is open ) . 
  incidentally , this plane would also have flown over afghanistan on its intended route , which is neither here nor there but does give an idea of context . 
  the point is the aircraft was not doing anything out of the ordinary . 
  also this was almost certainly not the only commercial jet to pass that way within the range of this machine that day . 
  i read somewhere that 55 commercial flights were scheduled to pass over that area that day . 
  why they decided this plane should be attacked will probably never be known . 
   lack of population growth means more people needing social spending without working i do n't understand this . 
  could you explain ? 
  i think you misunderstand . 
  the list we are talking about here are ` anglophone ' countries - specifically listed was ireland , usa , and the uk . 
   america is awful , the uk did n't seem much better - not sure about ireland . 
  now your own link indicates that a ) ireland has a second language rate of about 40 % and b ) the uk is worse . 
  [ forbes ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/collegeprose/2012/08/27/americas-foreign-language-deficit/ ) tells me the rate in the us is about 18 % . 
  this means ireland is actually the best of the listed countries at speaking a second language . 
  ( it also states that ireland ranks higher than italy , portugal , and hungary ) so your statement in response which said `` ireland 's the worst , if i recall correctly . '', 
  was absolutely wrong , and your own source showed it . 
  substitute london for oslo and the statement still stands . 
  not that i think scotland is similar to norway . 
  to be honest i 'm not really sure what the question is about . 
  it 's a weird thing to ask , which explains why 19 % gave ` do n't know ' . 
  actually snp supporters had the highest return of ` do n't know ' of all political affiliations . 
  of course , snp supporters are going to avoid saying ` the rest of the uk ' . 
  actually , it 's interesting that they use that term instead of ` england ' . 
  they did n't give anyone the option to say ` wales ' for example . 
  seems weighted to me . 
  a pro scottish independence person is given the option of saying the uk or some other country . 
  not surprising their do n't knows are so high .

   newbie detected . 
  time to re-calibrate your detector !, 
  i do indeed . 
  god that is the most awful image i 've seen all day . 
  i hope this does n't become a ` thing ' . 
  [ here ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/ll6ko ) is the area of the ustream feed on a normal day if anyone is interested . 
  thanks , this gives me lots of context for all the videos i 'm seeing as well as the live feed . 
  also that she is currently on hunger strike in jail . 
  a large portion of the country are against the uprising . 
  it 's probably gone down in the last while with the draconian new laws and violence from the cops , but in december it was pretty much 50-50 split ( roughly east-west ) . 
  thanks for the info , what part of kiev is this ? 
  street/area name or something ? 
  i 'm just trying to find the area on google maps so i can get my bearings, 
  who is doing the drumming ? 
   in time this will lead to a situation where us , china and eu will eclipse russia so much that they are n't in real terms sovereign i do n't understand this line of thinking . 
  how does not being a world power mean that you are n't sovereign ? 
  by this logic , australia ( for example ) is doomed . 
  or do you not consider australia to be sovereign ` in real terms ' ? 
  maybe our misunderstanding is in a different definition of that line . 
  well , in the me it 's more about abiding by the law , but in some ways it works a bit better ( or is perceived to ) and so some customers may feel they would like to have that option ( particularly in cost plus scenarios ) . 
  demand , meet supply . 
  no the gards are unarmed . 
  obviously like yourselves we have an armed/tactical unit , and i believe detectives can be armed or something like that , but the vast majority of gards are unarmed except for a billyclub and a quick wit . 
  [ put down that peace or i 'll belt ya !, 
  ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_e-bhzqyzcq8/tptbu66xu7i/aaaaaaaaafo/gdxuwzx-el0/s1600/baton1.jpg ) also , classic civil servants , two lads doing all the work while 15 others stand around . 
  ah no , i kid , the gards are sound enough . 
  after dealing with police from other countries , they are actually a relatively level headed group . 
   eu project is , at its heart , about creating links between countries that are difficult if not impossible to unravel . 
  if scotland were set on leaving the eu then this process , however difficult , would have to be done . 
  there 's no fear of scotland not being in the eu . 
  if anything this is just a paperwork thing . 
  eu membership is just a bunch of laws and agreements and these would have to be drafted or redrafted specifically including the ` people 's republic of scotland ' as a member . 
  but there 's nothing stopping that work happening immediately , it 's just signing them that needs to wait for after the box ticking ceremony . 
  does it mean the uk minus scotland would meet them ? 
  that would be hilarious if scotland seceded and then everyone had to use the euro !, 
   because they watched a porn video on redtube.com because of copyright infringement holy shit !, 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  how much is it ? 
  i used to think these people who used ` tor ' and the like all the time were tinfoil hatters , but i 'm starting to think we may need to go down that road . 
   not to be confused with : jp morgan chase , zurich financial services , the government of kazakhstan , or any of tony blair 's 467 other clients . 
  no real news here ...
