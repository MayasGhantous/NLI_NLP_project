  there 's no income tax in the oil rich arab countries either . 
  qatar , etc. 
  it 's british rice too . 
  could n't even buy irish rice . 
  next they 'll be buying rice from china ... 
  sorry , i was just being silly . 
  you used the term diplomatic immunity twice in your comment and it reminded me of that famous climactic scene in lethal weapon 2 when the bad guy shows his id and shouts ` diplomatic immunity ! ', 
  before murtaugh shoots him and responds ` it 's just been revoked ' . 
   sweden boots him out : that 's also not unsurprising for someone with diplomatic immunity caught spying . 
  ... would you say it 's just been revoked ? 
  i know yeah , it makes me shudder when i hear it . 
  there is a sort of tabloid infatuation with making contracted or portmanteau names for things in order to make them ` official ' or something , creating an easy soundbite that people can get talking about and therefore make news out of it . 
  i think the worst i ever heard was ` brangelina ' for brad pitt and angelina joli 's marriage . 
  absolute vomit . 
   grexit god is this a thing ? 
  this is actually worse than putting - gate after every scandal . 
   there 's a huge divide i can see as a teenager between the under 30 's and over 30 's as someone much closer to that age bracket , i see it more as the over 40 's and under 40 's . 
  that 's how everyone in wicklow looks .

  i totally had this idea in college . 
  did up the calculations and basic conceptual design and everything . 
  just goes to show its not the idea , its the will to execute it . 
  well it 's not exactly [ rocketing up ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=gbp&amp;to=usd&amp;view=1w ), 
  its one case that has been all over the papers today . 
  it seemed pertinent . 
  there is some evidence that elements of the british public have taken the result of this referendum as a greenlight to act aggressively towards anyone who is not considered british . 
  you are correct that it could just be ` hysteria ' . 
  i hope it is , though im not as skeptical as you . 
  time will tell in any case . 
  in the meantime it would be prudent for those folks in britain who are of an ethnicity or nationality that might put them in danger to take some precaution and be extra vigilant for the next couple of weeks until we get a better idea of the lie of the land and things cool down a little . 
  three arrested after harrassing someone on a tram this morning in manchester http://www.gmp.police.uk/content/websitepages/2f6651260df7958a80257fe00054b587, 
  all northern irish people are entitled to an irish passport ( article 2 of the good friday agreement ) . 
  this was agreed by referendum in ireland in the late 90 's with over 94 % in favour . 
  we would n't want to change that . 
   spanish politicians have been very clear , they wo n't veto scotlands ascension as long as it 's independence is with agreement from the uk gov do you have a specific source in mind for this ? 
  i hear all the time that spain would veto any scottish application to the eu even if it was bilateral and it has always seemed preposterous to me . 
  when is the last time we had an / r/ireland census ? 
  / u/stunt _ penguin might know . 
  no , because in irish ` i ' has a sound and it 's not that sound . 
  in english the same thing can sound several different ways depending on context learned only through verbal communication , but if you want written text to have a definite pronunciation then you have to either introduce more letters or start making clusters like in irish . 
  that 's actually galleria mall . 
  he 's always in the thick of it . 
  well it 's just one of those tricky legal things as far as i can see . 
  really the only major thing that gay couples are n't allowed to do is file joint applications for adoptions , or take joint custody of children in general ( afaik ) . 
  there are also some technical differences that affect the breakdown of a partnership etc. 
  it is important though to note that the people of ireland , generally speaking , are not opposed to ` everyone having the same rights ' as you put it . 
  from wikipedia :  a public survey in october 2008 revealed 62 % of adults would vote yes in a referendum to extend civil marriage to same-sex couples . 
   in september 2010 , an irish times/behaviour attitudes survey of 1,006 people showed that 67 % felt that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry . 
   a poll in march 2011 [ ... ] showed that 73 % of people supported allowing same-sex couples marry ( with 53 % ` agreeing strongly ' with the idea ) , while 60 % felt that same-sex couples should be allowed to adopt children . 
   the most recent poll , in january 2012 [ ... ] showed that 73 % of voters supported the idea of same-sex marriages being recognised in the constitution . 
  so yeah , we 're getting there and i think it fair to say that in this case as with many other cases , the populace is more progressive than the legislator . 
  but they will get there eventually . 
   do you think it will change soon ? 
  it 's already changing . 
  there 's new civil partnership laws which are considerd by most to be a stop gap measure until something proper is put in place . 
  a proper same sex marriage arrangement would require amendments to the wording of our constitution and thus a referendum . 
  there is talk about it happening though , below is our tanaiste ( like a vice president ) talking about it just the other day : [ eamon gilmore on same sex marriage ] ( http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/1113/gilmore-same-sex-marriage-referendum.html ), 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihezm6vbjfe ), 
  i really hope for everyone 's sake that things pick up soon . 
  europe has a long history of beating the shit out of itself . 
  currently we 're all working together and putting all that xenophobia aside , but it seems to me that things are getting slowly worse with the ongoing bailouts . 
  radical groups are getting more support , nationalism is becoming excessive , arguments are carrying more vitriol . 
  people have legitimate concerns about who is paying what to who and why they should be footing bills . 
  of course those are legitimate . 
  it seems all of us are paying for one thing or another . 
  either our country is bailing out other countries or our country is being bailed out . 
  either way we are finding ourselves with increasing taxes and decreasing services . 
  in both cases the average joe citizen is not at fault and yet their life is being made hard . 
  annoyance at that is perfectly legitimate and it is only right that we have these discussions about what is best for ourselves as separate nations . 
  but while focusing on these details and the struggles of here and now we must not lose sight of where we have come in the last 60 years , or the last 100 years . 
  it 's not that long ago that german and french and british and irish and finnish and italian and all the rest were killing eachother in droves . 
  we can not return to the way things were . 
  i 'm not saying that finland or greece or spain would cause a war by leaving the euro . 
  that 's crazy . 
  but i do think that if we all jump back into our shells , start using our own currency and put back up our walls , we 'll leave a colder and more hostile place for our children and their children to live in . 
  we 'll start a downward spiral and we know where it leads . 
  it 's not good . 
  the future of not just europe but the whole earth depends on increased cooperation , increased openness and support , increased communication , and a shared heritage . 
  i think the eu is a fantastic example this - of a beneficial alliance between old foes . 
  the day it begins to disintegrate will be a sad day for all of us . 
  it will be a regrettable waste of huge potential . 
  tl ; dr do n't do it finland !, 
  ( sorry about the essay ), 
  interesting reddit related tangent . 
  virtually every comment in here says something along the lines of ` no , op is wrong or a troll ' , yet this post has been upvoted pretty high . 
  how odd . 
  there 's a series of books called the ' a song of ice and fire ' which have been made into a very popular tv series called ` game of thrones ' . 
  in it , there is a man called ` lord baelish ' or more commonly ` littlefinger ' who among other things operates a brothel in the capital city , ` king 's landing ' . 
  the building in the picture is the building that is used as the brothel exterior on the show . 
  it is kind of cool to see it outside the show . 
  incidentally , much of the show is also shot in northern ireland . 
  it has been a boost to the local economy and there has apparantly been increased interest in ni as a tourist location because of it . 
  so that 's nice . 
  homicide rates of every country are more complicated than one thing . 
  even colorado , i 'm sure , has it 's own complexities wrt violent crime . 
  correlation does not imply causation either . 
  i did n't say `` it 's cause of guns '' though . 
  i only went as far as to argue against `` it 's ** not ** cause of guns '' which is what the poster above me was implying . 
  and the rate of homicides otherwise in the us is over [ 7 times ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate ) that of norway .
