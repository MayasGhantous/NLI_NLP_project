  other articles here [ this one ] ( http://www.fpri.org/2016/04/us-doesnt-muslim-problem-europe/ ) [ another one ] ( http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/whats-driving-european-muslims-extremism/ ) [ this other one ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/radicalised-muslims-in-uk-more-likely-to-be-well-heeled-9754062.html ) as for your second point , i definitely agree , it does make much more sense to build safe areas for them then bring them into europe and try establish them in a completely different world to what they 've known . 
  vetting  investigate ( someone ) thoroughly , especially in order to ensure that they are suitable for a job requiring secrecy , loyalty , or trustworthiness . 
  `` each applicant will be vetted by police '' the meaning has also been adapted as of late , to be more towards immigration and refugees . 
  all it means is to check people thoroughly ie . 
  genuine refugee , origin , identity , security threat etc, 
  unfortunately . 
  it 's also sad how these days almost no one can have an opinion on something anymore . 
  just a constant battle between left and right and it 's just getting ridiculous , especially when most of the people going on the attack are the biggest idiots on both sides . 
  like you want to limit immigration `` nazi right wing bigot islamaphobe '' even though you are a left leaning person . 
  or let 's help actual refugees `` no !, 
  you stupid libtard uneducated snowflake they 'll burn the world down if we let them in '' even if you are right leaning . 
  it 's especially infuriating when both sides have valid points but the other overlooks the other side . 
  and god forbid your political opinion spans several spectrums ( ie . 
  right foreign policy , left economic policy ) cause then everyone attacks you . 
  whatever happened to constructive talks ? 
  ( just notice i went on a bit of a rant but the world is frustrating haha ), 
  i can definitely agree , i 'm getting fed up with this mass unfiltered immigration from areas that are n't even war-torn . 
  personally i could n't care less about religion as long as they 're genuine . 
  i had a genuine refugee family move in next door a few months ago . 
  honestly they 're really great neighbours and they cook some really good food . 
  i 've been helping them with their english as well and once they 've finished that they want to learn irish too . 
  but economic migrants posing as refugees just annoys me so much . 
  it 's unfair on actual refugees , because it paints them all with a bad brush and makes it difficult for these people to get help . 
  thanks for the article definitely interesting . 
  the one 's who went back to syria , can never claim asylum again within the eu ( so maybe we should move them all to poland for a few months wait for them to leave and go back to syria/s ) and the one 's who went to germany can be deported back to poland after 90 days of their ` visiting ' days are over . 
  it 's things like this that make me question the authenticity of refugees but then on the other if i was them and i could n't find work i 'd go to germany too . 
  what i do n't understand then is why the eu is trying to get poland to except refugees if they just move out after a few months . 
  is there no logic left in the world ? 
   that one part of the country where all the weird shit happens ? 
  literally everywhere !, 
  except leitrim , no one lives there . 
   facebook/another major social network ? 
  facebook , snapchat and reddit  buzzfeed ? 
  lovindublin and many many others  the go-to meme website ? 
  reddit  that really stupid meme you wish foreigners would understand ? 
  basically the whole country ( cause it 's one giant meme )  that one comedian/comedy show that goes way too far that you wish foreigners would understand ? 
  tommy tiernan  that one easy to make fun of celebrity ? 
  bono from u2 or jedward  that one idiot politician ? 
  we have no sensible politicans but above all joan burton . 
  why is it a bad thing that poland wants a good relationship with america . 
  yes trump is not exactly a great president ( to say the least ) but diplomatic relationships last longer than 4 years . 
  plus with russia not far , is it not a good idea to maintain friendly relations ? 
  just a question for any polish and well any people here i 'm curious , if all migrants were properly vetted and the economic migrants deported , and security threats locked away , would you be more in favour of the refugee relocation programme by the eu , or is it simply that none are wanted under any circumstances ? 
  because if that was done i know i 'd be more in favour of it . 
  definitely , i look forward to its finish , as it might make dcc realise that tall buildings are n't scary . 
  * hopefully *, 
  yeah , dublin 's fairly unique as a capital city for that , we had plenty of plans like the [ watchtower ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/61/dc/72/61dc723ab1f5bb0af97b080c61d3631a.jpg ) and the [ u2 tower ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-74hes02_1ds/u0pr2aopo-i/aaaaaaaajt0/h8ogvycb-g0/s1600/u2+tower.jpg ) which would 've been 120m and 130m respectively , but 2008 grinded everything to a halt so here we are . 
  when i said ireland i mean the republic . 
  the obel tower 's actually a nice looking building did n't know that . 
  i remember that , it would 've looked so amazing , i personally loved the design of it . 
  there was also the [ watchtower ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/61/dc/72/61dc723ab1f5bb0af97b080c61d3631a.jpg ) which would been 120m and 40 floors high near the point , on the opposite side of the river , then the two towers would 've acted like a gateway into dublin from the liffey . 
  the crash also put an end to that along with the majority of beneficial things in the country . 
  there 's also this recent proposal called [ tara house ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3069076!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg ) which would be 88m , but dublin city council rejected it on height grounds , ( even though the sight is designated for 88m * sigh * ) i think the developer is going to appeal the decision to an bord plean\u00e1la , so it might get the go ahead ( not holding my breath though ), 
  we should , but ca n't , just due to the people who run for council elections and the people who always get voted in . 
  so we 're stuck in sprawl-land for the forseeable future . 
  at least san francisco has some high rise development . 
  but i know the feeling and it 's always the same bloody rhetoric `` high density does not mean high rise blah bleh blah '' meanwhile actual city planners are saying dublin ca n't continue as a low rise city anymore . 
  i mean with a metro area of 1.9 million people all spread out in housing housing estates and small towns , is it not time to stop bloody sprawling before we reach the other side of the country . 
  yeah , when you have insane height restrictions in place and the councils refuse to raise them , it leads to a property shortage and urban sprawl . 
  it would make total sense to have high rise buildings in dublin 's docklands , cork 's dockland 's and so on but it 's ireland , where nothing makes sense . 
  definitely , one of the ugliest buildings in the country . 
  it 's ashame [ these redevelopment plans ] ( http://archiseek.com/wp-content/gallery/news-2012/libertyhalldecision.jpg ) did n't go ahead due to an bord plean\u00e1la ( as per usual ), 
  i think i see where the confusion in the list is coming from , churchs are n't included under ireland 's ` tallest building ' wikipedia article and under hungary 's article they are . 
  tallest storyed building is what i meant sorry which is seemingly what this list is based off, 
  [ this ] ( https://m.imgur.com/qc7xzry ) will be ireland 's tallest * storyed * building by the end of the year . 
  it 's called capital dock and will be 79m ( 23 residential floors ) tall . 
  edit : added storyed, 
  yeah that 's true , i do n't know what our government is doing with apple . 
  13bn $ could go a long way to fixing a lot of issues and prepare the country for brexit , but here they are trying to appeal it . 
  this country frustrates me way more than a country should . 
  both are true however , countries like the netherlands , germany , sweden , finland , etc have bo shortage of english speakers either . 
  these countries also do n't have a severe housing shortage and sub-par infrastructure , and crazy height restrictions stopping decent development . 
  that 's my worry , unfortunately successive governments have let any advantage other than our tax rate slip away from us . 
  do you mean english is native to denmark or ... ? 
  i honestly do n't get what you mean edit : i was referring to the language in my first comment, 
  i 'm torn on this because i hate companies not paying tax , until i realise the irish economy is based on companies not paying tax , then it 's like `` can we maybe just let them not pay tax . . ? '', 
  because i 'd rather not have another recession, 
  4 different plantations aimed at replacing the local populace ulster , leinster , munster and the cromwellian plantations . 
  not to mention using a famine as a convenient way to remove irish people as the british government basically nothing to help . 
  that does n't sound like genocide no ? 
  i want you to know i do n't hold modern british people accountable for the sins of their ancestors . 
   pictland , also called pictavia by some sources , gradually merged with the gaelic kingdom of d\u00e1l riata to form the kingdom of alba ( scotland ) . 
  alba then expanded , absorbing the brittonic kingdom of strathclyde and northumbrian lothian , and by the 11th century the pictish identity had been subsumed into the `` scots '' amalgamation of peoples . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/picts ) so that 's not really a genocide is it ? 
  a merging of two kingdoms and the gaelic language became the primary language . 
  so if that 's a genocide , then scotland and england merging is a genocide too , as two kingdoms merged and english became the primary language ... 
  english  a non-indigenous invasive language forced onto the irish mainland via clay grabbing genocidal brits . 
  ftfy, 
  it 'd make sense but it 's ireland , nothing makes sense . 
  also because we 've been `` learning '' ( regurgitating random vocab ) through primary school we 're supposed to have some proficiency in the language so they try to get us to be fluent in a language in 5 years treating it like everyone knows all the grammar and basics when no one knows anything . 
  it 's basically the same as assuming someone can ride a bike and trying to teach them tricks , except they ca n't ride a bike , but they continue to try teach you tricks anyway . 
  could n't agree more , personally i 'm in the midst of trying to learn irish using apps like duolingo and such . 
  it 's sad and hilarious how and app can teach me irish better than the education system of the native country . 
  i really wish celtic mythology was taught , because i remember one time we had this substitute irish teacher , who was actually passionate about the language and culture , he told us the stories in irish and gave us a page of translations with key words and cultural footnotes , and honestly it was the only time the irish class was actually interested in something in irish class . 
  so if celtic languages were taught with more passion and brought in the long histroy and culture and mythology of the languages , they would be way more interesting and enjoyable to learn . 
  yeah , that 's an improvement on how irish is taught . 
  we start our foreign languages late aswell , but generally those are taught waaaay better . 
  instead of grinding through vocab constantly , we 'd listen to german music or watch german tv/movies . 
  we still had verb sheets , etc because they need to be known but you learn about the culture and literature of these places making the language seem more interesting . 
  if irish was taught the same way maybe people would speak it .
