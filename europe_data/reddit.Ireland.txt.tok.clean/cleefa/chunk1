at night time and as a drinking spot i would agree with you . 
  there are some nice eateries though . 
  the saturday morning food market is nice too - but that 's more for locals . 
  naval and marine if i remember correctly . 
  i miss having a minister for fish and ships . 
  nope , not really . 
  there is a bit more on the faqs page but they could do with explaining each of the categories and sub categories more extensively . 
  you can click through and look at the [ break down for each category ] ( http://www.goodcountry.org/category/planet-climate#aut ) if you want . 
  [ brian boru ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brian_boru ) , one of our high kings , was pretty interesting . 
  you living in dublin ? 
  try against the grain - tasty food and craft beer .

  you can do the same in ireland . 
  i went straight from undergrad comp sci to a phd programme in ucd . 
  a msc is n't always required . 
  you generally need at least a 2.1 in your undergrad . 
  you can often transfer from msc to phd ( or indeed vice versa ) without finishing the msc too . 
  we 've been commemorating the 1000th anniversary of the [ battle of clontarf ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/battle-of-clontarf-re-enactment-attracts-40-000-spectators-1.1768143 ) . 
  here ya go : [ 1 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtjqw--dgl8 ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yeoygarmas ) . 
  they made a point of showing them in the late afternoon too when most teens would be watching tv . 
  ssh , do n't be giving them ideas !, 
  the burton is really lovely . 
  it 's in the national gallery if anyone wants to see it but as it 's a watercolour it has limited viewing times : mondays & wednesdays , 11am-12pm ; saturdays , 3pm-4pm . 
  i really like * faic * it means ( emphatically ) nothing and is pronounced fwack with a really hard k . we also have a lot of fun with the words * focail * ( word , pr . 
  fuckle ) and * focl\u00f3ir * ( dictionary , pr . 
  fuck-lore ) in school . 
   some others : ( ch is as in bach ) * mac t\u00edre * wolf ( lit . 
  son of the land ) pr : mock teer-ah * lus an chromchinn * daffodil ( lit . 
  flower of the bent head ) pr : loose on chrum-cheen * f\u00e9ileac\u00e1n * butterfly pr : fay-leh-cawn * smugairle r\u00f3n * jellyfish ( lit . 
  growth of one night ) pr : faws eyn ee-tha eta : typo, 
  i really like the scottish song ` tramps and hawkers ' but i only know [ luke kelly 's version . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvpotucka4w ), 
  [ here 's a nice list ] ( http://fungibleconvictions.com/2009/08/11/hiberno-english-words-for-drinking-too-much/ ) of hiberno-english words for drunk . 
  a tradition we share i think . 
  it 's meant as a translation of daid\u00ed na nollag not as an indication of what we say in english . 
  i 've no idea , sorry . 
  we have no etymological dictionary . 
  irish spelling wrecks peoples ' heads . 
   have a read of this sometime it might help : [ irish orthography ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_orthography ) . 
  * \u00cdsilt\u00edr * and ` nederland ' mean the same thing . 
  * \u00cdseal * = low , * t\u00edr * = country . 
  * phortaing\u00e9il * is pretty close though . 
  it 'd be pronounce ` fert-ing-gale ' . 
  the i is not much different . 
  * iod\u00e1il * is pronounced ` i-dawl ' . 
  do n't mind the o that 's there because of a spelling rule to do with consonants , it 's silent . 
  a h in irish is called a [ s\u00e9imhi\u00fa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_initial_mutations ) and indicates lenition , so * an fhrainc * would be pronounced similar to the english ` on rank ' . 
  whereas the irish for french * francach * would be pronounced ` fron-kach ' . 
  i do n't understand your question about * iod\u00e1il * but i think it might help to know that t and d and very close sounds and were interchangeable in old irish . 
  we do that in irish too . 
  absolutely wrecks learners heads . 
  a c\u00f3ta ( her coat ) , a ch\u00f3ta ( his coat ) , a gc\u00f3ta ( \u00ed ) ( their coat ( s ) ) . 
  no room for confusion what so ever !, 
  what 's the welsh for football , the sport , because ` peil ' in irish means football and liathr\u00f3id means ball ? 
  we do n't really have one of those . 
  we do have a few words to indicate negation . 
  they work a bit like ` ne ... pas ' from french . 
  most would translate to one of the these : not , is n't , do n't , did n't , am n't * . 
  they are a little tricky to translate to english as they do n't tend to match . 
  if you take ` no smoking ' : * n\u00e1 caitear tabac [ anseo ] * ( tobaco is not smoked/spent [ here ] ) . 
  * n\u00e1 * is more like ` do n't ' though - it 's an order form . 
  \\* this should be a word in english !, 
  ` thank you ' can be interesting in languages . 
  in irish there is n't really any quick way ( like thanks ) you have to say ` go raibh maith agat ' which is a mouthful !, 
  so you usually want to mean it before going to the trouble !, 
  you do get ` gurra m\u00edle '' which is slang and is just a rhyming thing from ` go raibh m\u00edle maith agat ' ( many thanks/a thousand thanks ) . 
  yeah , some people find it infuriating . 
   we say ` indeed ' a lot apparently . 
  we 've no words for yes or no which a lot of people find confusing . 
  it 's a strangely large number all right . 
  the last census from 2011 gives 112,259 as the number of ordinarily resident people from the uk . 
  yeah , if someone wants to change their name i think they should be allowed . 
  i knew and aoife who went by ifa when she lived abroad to make things easier . 
  just as long as it 's not required . 
  i find it helps in that if people see one they tend to stop and ask you how to pronounce your name rather than just guess . 
  it flags it as being from a language not their own . 
  okay bad name example . 
  how about this - m\u00edch\u00e1el ( mee-hawl ) lose the diacritics and you get michael ( my-cull ) . 
  what would you suggest for a m\u00edch\u00e1el under your proposed rule . 
  the ferdia example does however illustrate that the pronunciation problems of foreign names are n't just limited to unusual letters though . 
  okay how about this - many irish names are very hard to write/spell in english and have them still pronounced the correctly because english is missing a few sounds that exists in irish . 
  take ferdia for instance . 
  the closest i could get in english is furdtheeah but most english speakers would have terrible trouble with that d sound ( it 's really soft and slides into the t ) . 
  they tend to pronounce it furdy-ah which is close but not quite right . 
  plus some would look ridiculous - sadb/sadhbh would become sighv . 
  ( yes i know sadb looks ridiculous too - it makes perfect sense in irish , honest . ), 
  i disagree that the written form does n't matter . 
  it does to me and i imagine it does to others . 
  there is an \u00ed in my name and i do n't like it when people i know well ignore it .
