  if it 's left out of the written form it tends to make it more likely that people will put the emphasis on the wrong vowel and it sounds horrible . 
  my name can be ( and has been ) spelt phonetically in english and it looks odd . 
  but you have to balance that against it not being your name . 
  also it would cause havoc with your old records - your birth cert , passport , school/college records would have a different name on them . 
  besides people in my own country do n't pronounce/spell my name right anyway . 
  are you suggesting that all foreign people who move to germany should change their names if they have diacritics ? 
  or just babies born there ? 
  louis is pronounced `` looey '' by most english speaking nations . 
  to get the ame pronunciation it needs to be spelt lewis . 
  just fyi . 
  are there any links between snus and mouth/throat cancer ? 
  might be a combination of the long term influence of the smoking ban ( 2004 ) and those new advertising and sales rules around tobacco ( 2009 ) . 
  nice , thanks . 
  will give them a shot . 
  it is damn tasty . 
  i do find myself liking all of the 8 degrees stuff i 've tried but i have n't had that one . 
  i have n't seen dungarvan about . 
  did you get in dublin anywhere ? 
  my local off license folded a few months back . 
  't was a sad sad day . 
  i prefer 8 degrees red ale . 
  my favourite beer though is probably beoir chorca dhuibhne/west kerry brewery 's carraig dubh porter/stout . 
  it really is a matter of preference though . 
  apparently it does happen after rt\u00c9 's evening film on christmas day . 
  it 's from the 2011 census . 
  the numbers are up from 2006 . 
  i know a lot of people who speak irish fluently and even more who speak it well . 
  i guess it depends on your circle . 
  those 1.77 million can speak irish , according to the last census , but there is no information about what level of fluency they have . 
  i 'd say the welsh might have a higher degree of fluency among welsh speakers . 
  irish has been a compulsory school subject for c. 90 years so theoretically everyone should have at least some . 
  i 'd buy that . 
  yep , but so is the welsh number supplied . 
  i ca n't find much info about fluency . 
  the info below would suggest that there at the very least 77k fluent speakers though there is likely many more . 
  unfortunately the census does n't ask question about fluency . 
  considering irish has been compulsory since the 1930s the fact that 60 % of population say they have no irish is a bit depressing . 
  here 's so more info from the last census which talks about frequency . 
  i do n't have the same info for wales . 
  total population 4.589 million total irish speakers 1,774,437 and the frequency with which they speak irish : daily speakers ( outside education ) 77,185 daily speakers ( in education ) 519,181 < - irish is a mandatory school subject weekly ( outside education ) 110,642 less often ( outside education ) 613,236 never ( outside education ) 438,782 not stated 15,411, 
  i 'd say it 's probable that there are relatively more day-to-day welsh speakers all right . 
  i ca n't find statistics on the frequency of irish usage outside of gaeltacht areas , only ability . 
  though i 'd say ` very few ' is an understatement . 
  eta : found frequency stats , but nothing about fluency . 
  total population 4.589 million total irish speakers 1,774,437 and the frequency with which they speak irish : daily speakers ( outside education ) 77,185 daily speakers ( in education ) 519,181 < - irish is a mandatory school subject weekly ( outside education ) 110,642 less often ( outside education ) 613,236 never ( outside education ) 438,782 not stated 15,411, 
  not if you are talking about absolute number of speakers . 
  ireland 1.77 million of 4.589 million people so 37 % . 
  wales 560,000 of 3.064 million people so 18.0 % . 
  the original number of 720,000 for welsh speakers included those living outside of wales . 
  there are an additional 104,311 irish speakers living outside of ireland . 
  it is possible there are more welsh people , relatively speaking , whose primary language is welsh than there are irish people whose primary language is irish though . 
  it 's hard to tell . 
  the statistics speak of ` native ' for irish but ` fluency ' for welsh which are really not the same thing . 
  for instance i speak , read and write irish fluently but i would not describe myself as a native speaker . 
  wikipedia would suggests there are more irish ( 1.77 million ) speakers than welsh ( 720,000 ) . 
  but it is strange that they did n't do welsh . 
  do you know if it 's recognised at the eu level ? 
  it took ages for us to get irish recognised . 
  also no love for scots , scottish gaelic , manx , breton or cornish . 
  ` it is the language of a community/people that will save the community ' . 
  roughly . 
  i think he 's trying to say it will maintain the community closeness/bonds . 
  * a shl\u00e1n\u00f3s * should mean ` will save ' . 
  * sl\u00e1n * means safe , as in * sl\u00e1n abhaile * , it 's * sl\u00e1inte * for health but they are related . 
  it can also mean succeed , secure , complete , round !, 
  irish : it is the community 's language that will save/secure the community . 
  in irish we call you ` the low country ' ( an \u00cdsle t\u00edr ) . 
  met \u00c9ireann also has this lovely sentence :  the general impression is that it rains quite a lot of the time in ireland but in fact two out of three hourly observations will not report any measurable rainfall . 
  so it ** only ** rains 1 out of every 3 hours . 
  thanks . 
  i do n't think we can really be calling tralee a city . 
  we are kind of taking the piss with galway and kilkenny already . 
  i was thinking that . 
  galway and cork really * ought to be on that list . 
  yep , it 's thoroughly inconsistent . 
  yes , - ing is terribly useful . 
  `` on tackling unemployment ... '' in irish for you for comparison * `` ag dul i ngleic leis an d\u00edfhosta\u00edocht ... '' * ( to go in engagement with ( the ) unemployment ) . 
  mind if i comment ? 
  i 'm technically a native speaker but i was educated through irish . 
  pronunciation : english begs , borrows and steals from other languages and you nearly need to know which one in order to figure out how to pronounce a word . 
  in irish if we borrow a word we change how it 's spelled so it 's more phonetic and more consistent . 
  i pity poor tourists who are forced to try and pronounce anglicized irish place-names . 
  in particular kiltimagh . 
  it 's just cruel . 
  fuzzy grammar : there are all these ` rules ' that no one agrees on and they have exceptions . 
  irish has one spelling rule , which sometimes leads to long words , but you ca n't break it !, 
  vocabulary : it has a lot of words from many different languages - this makes puzzling out meanings of new words difficult . 
  irish is a bit like german - we like taking words and sticking them together to make new words . 
  irregular verbs : so many . 
  irish has 11 and they are the most common ones so you have them learned off pretty quick . 
  verbing : suddenly anything and everything can become a verb !, 
  it 's weird . 
  useful though . 
  vagueness : english seems more ambiguous to me . 
  it 's easier to misinterpret something . 
  i think it goes back to a less rigid grammar . 
  tenses/cases/syntax : these do n't match which can lead to fun . 
  it 's also why hiberno-english is a bit odd . 
  ** good things : ** plurals : so easy . 
  mutations : irish mutates both the start and end of the word depending on tense/case/subject / other .
