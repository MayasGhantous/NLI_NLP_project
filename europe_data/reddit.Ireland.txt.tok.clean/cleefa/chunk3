  if you make a mistake ( mostly when writing ) it can be confusing . 
  english has very little mutation/conjugation . 
  brevity : it 's much easier to write short concise sentences . 
  yes & no : you have words for these !, 
  we do n't which does n't help with the brevity issue . 
  you can say ` take not the hat ' it 's just that it sounds shakespearean . 
   but , english makes it very easy to pack a lot of information into few words , and as someone who speaks two extremely analytical languages ( greek and french ) , that 's godsend . 
  ( but it makes software localisation difficult , because the english-speaking developer designed the ui to fit the short english dialogue , and the greek translation will not fit whatever tricks you try to pull . 
  been there ) . 
  yes !, 
  i translate press releases into irish sometimes as a favour for a boat club and the irish sentences always end up so long . 
  english seems to have way more verbs or maybe irish just has too many compound verbs . 
  english also does n't seem to have much in the way of multi-word nouns . 
  if you follow my meaning ? 
  for instance daffodil is * lus an chromchinn * in irish . 
  [ their volcanic eruptions directly affect our weather . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22786179 ) icelandic is really close to old norse and is therefore really useful to learn if you are studying old english . 
  the few icelandic people i met were nuts . 
  and i mean that as a compliment !, 
  i really like the [ beoir chorca duibhne/west kerry brewery ] ( http://www.westkerrybrewery.ie/ ) ones . 
  their stout , carraig dubh , is fantastic . 
  [ 8 degrees ] ( http://www.eightdegrees.ie/ ) are quite nice too , they have a very nice red ale in particular . 
  also what 's with spacing after the ps ? 
  it looks really weird . 
  yeah . 
  i do think the closet is more effective . 
  maybe if dishwashers were n't so popular we might go for it . 
  we have [ free standing versions ] ( http://i01.i.aliimg.com/photo/v3/261104577/house_shape_metal_dish_rack_plate_rack.jpg ) of those in ireland . 
  they go on the counter beside the sink . 
  some sample irish journey for comparison . 
  despite there being one train company it varies a bit depending on the line : dublin ( hueston ) to tullamore - 105km is $ 19.00 standard fare . 
  dublin ( connolly ) to newry , ni - 103km is $ 15.99 standard fare ( $ 45.00 first-class ) . 
  dublin ( connolly ) to enniscorthy - 119km is $ 15.99 standard fare . 
  ireland : [ a body was found in the dublin/wicklow mountains on friday ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/post-mortem-due-on-human-remains-discovered-in-dublin-1.1528330 ) , not much is known yet . 
  [ a man was found dead in meath . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/two-released-over-meath-body-find-1.1528314 ) it is believed he was murdered and two people are under investigation . 
  a [ chain of british pubs ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/agribusiness-and-food/british-chain-wetherspoon-set-to-open-up-to-30-pubs-in-ireland-1.1527271 ) are said to be opening up in ireland . 
  they tried before but got scared off by the cost of doing business here . 
  the campaigns for and against the seanad ( senate ) abolition referendum are hotting up . 
  a group of politicians thrown out of fine gael for voting against party lines have come together to create [ the reform alliance . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/reform-alliance-in-talks-over-collective-approach-1.1528318 ) which is funny because they are conservative . 
  some fun : a group of teenage school children have been making a name for themselves covering [ pop music in irish . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggt0cghjofe ), 
  we could bring the carbs ? 
  soda bread , colcannon , boxty and potato cakes are all pretty tasty . 
  also guinness stew would be nice . 
  the ` free fees ' business in ireland is a bit of an over simplification . 
  yes you do n't pay tuition fees but you do have to pay registration fees and they can be a bit pricey . 
  so to study computer science at ucd for example you would have annually : first time irish student : $ 2,708 eu student : $ 7,528 non-eu student : $ 20,000, 
  it is a good one . 
  honourable mentions for shitehawk and gobshite too . 
  geebag is great too . 
  ( very long way of saying bullshit ) go n-ithe cat th\u00fa agus go n-ithe an diabhal an cat !, 
  li\u00fadram\u00e1n - idiot amad\u00e1n - idiot \u00d3inseach - idiot ( sensing a theme ? ), 
  striapach - whore edit : spelling . 
  flannery was not the only crying during that !, 
  half the stadium was with him . 
  i do n't think i have ever heard amhr\u00e1n na bhfiann sung like that before or since . 
  i always forget how close welsh and breton are . 
  it 's really lovely . 
  i love la marseillaise - it 's so passionate . 
  the welsh one is lovely when they have a welsh male voice choir sing it before rugby matches . 
  honourable mention for the a cappella version of the flower of scotland too . 
  apparently it 's really useful to learn it if you are studying old english too . 
  the cold tap in the kitchen connects directly to the mains . 
  bathroom cold taps usually connect to a tank . 
  internet says wisconsin . 
  got a citation for that ? 
  gaudi ? 
  what about the rest of the yeats family ? 
  orson welles ? 
  he was american was he not ? 
  have you ever tried to do shopping in wexford town ? 
  i did once while staying in a hostel there . 
  there 's a tesco near the coast and then mount everest between tesco and the hostel . 
  just expanding on the older ( georgian , edwardian , etc ) houses [ this ] ( https://maps.google.com/?ll=53.323235,-6.211782&amp;spn=0.013329,0.042272&amp;t=m&amp;z=15&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.323014,-6.211576&amp;panoid=wuchlcymzoiqnjlfligx9a&amp;cbp=12,235.77,,0,3.2 ) is a street in a typical older dublin [ suburb * ] ( https://maps.google.com/?ll=53.332174,-6.215174&amp;spn=0.000833,0.002642&amp;t=m&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=53.332173,-6.215687&amp;panoid=awg4dxe979esf-nkt8x63a&amp;cbp=12,3.94,,0,10.07 ) . 
  they are now cost a pretty penny though . 
  \\* there was a ring of small towns very close to dublin that became suburbs and then villages within dublin . 
  the modern suburbs are well out beyond them . 
  most of the large ones . 
  a lot of the european hqs for tech companies are here in ireland . 
  just in case you do n't know the ira of that same period ( up to 1922 ) and the current ira ( s ) are not the same group either . 
  i disagree . 
  they were liked by some but in my lifetime they have been disliked by most . 
  i 'm only in my 30s though so i was n't around for the 70s . 
  they had very strong support in america . 
  and of course they had strong support in northern ireland . 
  there was certainly a strong negative opinion of many directed at the british army , the ruc and various other agents of the british government . 
  but i do n't think it really translated into widespread support of the actions of the ira & co. 
  given that there were bombings in ireland ( state ) too , mostly by loyalists , not many people were supportive of their techniques . 
  all my opinion of course . 
  i 'm not a historian or anything . 
  you enjoyed revolutions so much you decided to come and try to help us too !, 
  i 'm not well read on the details but there were some dodgy things going on on both sides during the civil war . 
  not really on the same scale as a lot of the other things mentioned in this thread but it was n't great . 
  could you expand on why you associate the actions of the ira with ireland and the irish public and not just with that group ? 
  also modern halloween may have been imported back from america by many cultures but it was exported to america from ireland and scotland first . 
  samhain/halloween is celebrated a little bit differently in ireland ( and presumably scotland ) to other parts of europe as a result . 
  that probably has a lot to do with heaney being an irishman . 
  starting a sentence with ` so ' , or indeed it being a sentence on it 's own as in beowulf , is very common in hiberno-english .
