  heaney describes it 's usage in ulster as : `` operates as an expression which obliterates all previous discourse and narrative , and at the same time functions as an exclamation calling for immediate attention . '', 
  it 's 3 minutes away . 
  in sport : london are competing in their first connacht football championship final . 
  it also does n't cover cases where the health of the woman is in danger . 
  it should provide some clarity for doctors regarding the legality of abortions/terminations . 
  ** ireland ** there was an explosion in a laundry in [ kilarney ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/gardai-seek-help-in-tracing-missing-people-following-killarney-explosion-1.1463069 ) this morning and one ( maybe two ) man is still missing . 
  we [ finally have abortion legislation ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/abortion-debate ) in-line with a 20 + year old court ruling and our constitution . 
  one td was enough of an idiot to get caught on tv being [ inappropriate ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/td-barry-apologises-for-pulling-collins-onto-lap-1.1460330 ) with one of his female colleagues . 
  apparently he is ` sorry ' and it was just ` horseplay ' . 
  uh huh . 
  the rest of the news has mostly been about northern ireland and the parades . 
  i think you mean nationalist . 
  unionist/loyalist means they are loyal to the uk . 
  nationalists are the ones who want a united ireland . 
  nice and confusing !, 
  we actually spent a long time on french history in ireland as it had such an impact ( inspiration ? ), 
  for a lot of our history . 
  well we would get in trouble for speaking english . 
  it was an irish medium school though and they tend to rely on immersion . 
  my primary school did ban sweets , soft drinks and crisps which was kind of mean . 
  my mom hated the rule though so she 'd make us cake to go with our lunch which was n't banned . 
  it also had a ` no running in the front yard ' rule that sounds over the top but that was because there was a steep hill with glass doors at the bottom !, 
  ah , my apologies . 
  teach me to post when i 'm half asleep . 
  \\* cough cough \\*, 
  they are two sections of school . 
  primary is usually up to about 12 . 
  secondary after that until late teens . 
  in primary or secondary ? 
  it did initially , in the 20s and 30s , and it fell out of favour specifically because on the dispute i mentioned . 
  no of course not . 
  it was tense on both sides . 
  but the history should explain to you why we prefer ireland . 
  we get upset because the country we had to win our independence from refused to call us by our proper name until 1997 . 
  it was a deliberate slight rather than anything else . 
  a way for the british government to belittle and insult . 
  that 's why we get upset about it . 
  it very deliberate - so much so that it was a condition of the good friday agreement that they stop . 
  it 's also spelt wrong which is mildly annoying . 
  the english version of the irish constitution is considered a translation * with the irish language version being the official version . 
  perhaps that why ? 
  article 4 states :  the name of the state is \u00c9ire , or , in the english language , ireland . 
  in irish for comparison :  \u00c9ire is ainm don st\u00e1t n\u00f3 , sa sacs-bh\u00e9arla , ireland . 
  which would hold with it being an english version of the irish document . 
  \\* it was more likely actually written in english and then translated . 
  there is a whole section of dublin named after wellington - couple of pubs too . 
  we have lots named after various british things even though we went around renaming a lot of them in the 1920s . 
  you get hold overs though - like the eye and ear hospital is actually called the royal victoria . 
  look at the sidebar near the top - you will see a reference to your ` flair ' for the sub reddit . 
  click ` edit ' . 
  yes , lots . 
  my other reply got eaten . 
  short version - i have n't a clue but to me they sound different , sorta long and broad . 
  i do n't know why but they do sound different . 
  i ca n't think of any words spelt the same bar the double consonant but c\u00e9n and ceann sound like they have different ns to me . 
  i may be talking through my hat though . 
  do you mean gh , bh etc. ? 
  the h is actually there to indicate lenition , b -  v , g/d -  j/y , rather than really being a letter . 
  we used to have an accent called a buailte , basically a dot over the consonant , but it made printing expensive so we switched to a h. 
  it is indeed . 
  we are very fond of silent letters . 
  see gheobhaidh meaning ` will get ' and pronounced yo-ee . 
  by the way fh\u00edon ( wine ) in irish is pronounced \u00edn ( een ) too . 
  ` leis leis leis , leis ' is irish for ` with his naked thigh , also ' . 
  all pronounced the same and it 's grammatically correct . 
  weird . 
  joe had a wife , a banjo , and joe 's wife had a banjo . 
  but joe was altogether better on the banjo than joe 's wife would ever be on the banjo .

  yeah it 's about 41 % or so . 
  ireland 's population is a bit of a mess in the 20th century . 
  in 1901 it was 3.22 million , now it 's 4.58 million ( highest it 's been since the 1850s ) but it bottomed out at 2.82 million in the 1960s . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_population_analysis ), 
  just fyi the ireland and it 's size reference there is the island , i.e. 
  ireland ** and ** northern ireland , not ireland the country which is only 70,273 km ^ 2 . 
  not that i know of . 
  might n't be old enough though . 
  i miss the [ designs of old irish money ] ( http://www.irishcoinage.com/1928set.htm ) - i wish we had put the animals on our euro coins rather than just the harp .

   is b\u00e9arlachas \u00e9 . 
  * it is very different from english , i reckon irish has more in common with french/spanish . 
  it 's said exactly the same as ` well ' . 
   it 's an anglicisation *, 
  * well , languages in this example and ^ they are different countries . 
  there are other small differences * ^ 's is more like 'n' than and, 
   * there is a difference between northern ireland and ireland too . 
  no the polls are open from 7am to 10pm . 
  we 've taken to using hallo for answering the phone but it is a recent change . 
  or ` i ' meaning present/at/in . 
  i had rodenbach grand cru last week for the first time - so so tasty . 
  bbc stargazing live is back tonight for those that have access ( 8pm bbc2 ) - they 'll be talking about it i believe . 
  as a second language i suppose . 
  it 's also not exactly foreign here . 
  that stuff is tasty . 
  especially the one with the hazelnut filling .
