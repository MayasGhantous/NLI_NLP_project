  it 's very sweet though . 
  the plan is to [ commemorate all of it ] ( http://www.decadeofcentenaries.com/ ) . 
  we get the next monday off if a public holiday falls on the weekend but we do n't move weekday ones - i.e. 
  we got thursday last off for paddy 's day but the 28th of december off for st stephen 's day ( 26th was a saturday ) . 
  contraction of ` is ea ' - another version of it is using the copula this time . 
  see n\u00ed hea for the negative . 
  t\u00e1 does n't really mean yes . 
  it 's the present tense of ` to be ' e.g. 
  t\u00e1 m\u00e9 = = i am , t\u00e1imid = = we are . 
  irish does n't have words that mean yes or no . 
  [ diarmuid and gr\u00e1inne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_pursuit_of_diarmuid_and_gr%c3%a1inne ) is a good story too . 
  i could n't find an info-graphic for ireland but as the naval service only has 8 ships i can just list :  the fleet comprises one helicopter patrol vessel ( hpv ) , three offshore patrol vessels ( opv ) , two large patrol vessel ( lpv ) and two coastal patrol vessels ( cpv ) . 
  each vessel is equipped with state of the art machinery , weapons , communication 's and navigation systems . 
  the flagship of the irish naval service is the l.\u00c9 . 
  eithne which a hpv . 
   the ns fleet keeps the tradition of naming its vessels after famous women from irish and celtic mythology . 
  currently the naval service operates eight ships . 
   l.\u00c9 .

  eh it 's bloody freezing , we may not have a government , the tram people keep striking and i think we are relying on ye for chocolate . 
  maybe ? 
  also cadbury are striking tomorrow . 
  they count all the parcels before finishing each round . 
  i think are asking about vote distribution from round 2 on though ? 
  how they distribute them and if ordering can affect the results ? 
  i think it is possible . 
  i 'm not sure though . 
  candidates are entitled to a recount and a full recount . 
  there are a few happening today and they are common enough . 
  i 'm not sure of the exact rules there though . 
  the quote is : ( total valid votes / ( no of seats + 1 ) ) + 1, 
  it is interesting how little the uvf & co are mentioned - as well as the whole ignoring a few centuries of set-up . 
  well that 's not terrifying . 
  us too in ireland except it 's called pancake tuesday . 
  i think you can guess how we celebrate !, 
  that 's shameful . 
  though it sort of so bad it 's good . 
  surely [ fatal deviation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fatal_deviation ) is ireland 's worst film ? 
  i doubt there are any adults who only speak irish . 
  there are still those who primarily do though . 
  there are probably children under the age of five who only speak irish - not many but some . 
  they would learn english very young though - even if they go to an irish speaking school they would have english classes by about 6/7 . 
  ath-bhliain is new year , bliain \u00far is fresh year . 
   duit is singular you so i switch it plural you ( daoibh ), 
  if you are taking about irish i , like many , am fluent . 
  bonus : [ ireland 's original parliament house ] ( http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3208/2789185897_2c58c78194.jpg ) which was in use up to the act of union ( 1800 ) [ more info ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_houses_of_parliament ), 
  also irish . 
  i speak english ( native ) , irish ( fluent ) and french ( awful ) . 
  then the tin will be saved to use to store sewing supplies . 
  [ one or three ] ( http://www.beoir.org/index.php/craft-beer-directories/breweries ), 
  darn , i was close-ish with castle . 
  fantastic thanks . 
  they were indeed . 
  they made up the province m\u00edde, 
  llan is church right ? 
  what about the rest ? 
  i 'm thinking caer might have something to do with castles ? 
  hmm - \u00edn is very common in irish but i 'm not sure we are the only ones using it . 
  - igh ( ee ) maybe ? 
  we have faol/faolch \u00fa too . 
  we can just get a bit poetic sometimes . 
  and the lovely ` b\u00f3\u00edn d\u00e9 ' ~ ` god 's little cow ' for ladybugs . 
  us too !, 
   \u00d6l it looks a lot like ` drink ' in irish ( \u00f3l ) . 
  is it pronounced oh-l ? 
  sorry i was n't clear - inheritance between the couple . 
  normally here when a married person dies their spouse inherits everything . 
  not sure that was the case for civilly partnership . 
  could be wrong though . 
  there is a list here http://www.marriagequality.ie/marriageaudit/ or look for a report called missing pieces by marriage equality ireland, 
  there were 170 but i ca n't remember them . 
   there were some important ones around inheritance law i think . 
  the ' separate but equal ' thing was n't what people wanted though too . 
  we actually legalized adoption for gay couples before we legalized same sex marriage . 
  did n't stop the no side using it as an argument though . 
  his irish is off ... unless that 's meant to be old irish ? 
  i like how they did the central bank, 
  the irish language is gaelic / goidelic not brythonic . 
  same as in english . 
  however we never capatlize an elipsis which can look funny . 
  so ` women of ireland ' would ` mn\u00e1 na h\u00c9ireann ' - the h stays small . 
  even if it 's in all caps : `` mn\u00c1 na h\u00c9ireann ' . 
  [ here 's an example with a leading n ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/gaeltacht_donegal_cropped.jpg/567px-gaeltacht_donegal_cropped.jpg ) . 
  it also shows the lack of dot on the i. 
  or ` that 's a bit irish ' . 
  modern irish for wales is still little britain - an bhreatain beag . 
  irish also has a [ buailte ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dot_ ( diacritic \\ ) ) ( small dot over the letter ) which can be applied to certain consonants and is used to indicate lenition . 
  the effect can also be achieved with a following h , for instance \u1e03 and bh are both pronounced like a v ( or sometimes w ) , \u010b and ch are both as in bach . 
  it is less common now in standard orthography , the h is usually used , but is still prevalent in calligraphy and decorative signage . 
  [ more about the irish alphabet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_orthography#alphabet ), 
   ( 2180 / 52 ) / 5 = 8.38 is that right ? 
  that 'd be your daily rate if you worked every week day of the year . 
  seems a bit nuts unless you have a very long commute . 
  all your options are [ here ] ( https://www.taxsaver.ie/ticket-types/ ) . 
  you can max out with bus , tram , light rail and commuter rail at $ 2180.00 . 
  do n't worry , it 's the perspective , it 's actually about 2 feet away . 
  i never leave it unattended either . 
  what about whisky ?
