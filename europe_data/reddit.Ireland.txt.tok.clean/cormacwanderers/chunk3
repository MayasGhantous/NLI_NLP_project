  the best rail system in europe is now the worst in europe.the social democrats are n't socialist as in `` let 's seize all our country 's assets and spend all our money '' socialist , they are in moderate democratic socialism and the nordic model . 
  two weeks in july were pretty bad here . 
  the rest has been average or better than average . 
  water and rail privatisation on the cards . 
  homes being taken off families ( they should n't leave them in my opinion . ), 
  and the government is doing the worst in the eu at curbing corruption . 
  we could get economic growth with another government . 
  we need the social democrats to rule us . 
  slovak border guard : `` ahoj , welcome to slovakia . 
  are you christian ? '', 
  `` no i 'm not nazarene . 
  i 'm muslim . '', 
  `` you are f ** king muslim . 
  go back to hungary . 
  have a nice day . '', 
  it could also be part of it that men could say they are lesbian . 
  garth brooks concert saga . 
  some eejits from the west paying to see some shite american country singer and winging when it 's cancelled . 
  i wish we could have an election as soon in ireland . 
  i have a feeling that gerry adams will tweet this . 
  it 's really helped exports here as well . 
  i think ireland , spain and portugal are getting the most benefit from it . 
  even greece has economic growth . 
  the devaluation of the euro is really helping the irish economy . 
  tourists are coming to ireland instead of the uk because it is so much cheaper . 
  at the moment there are a lot of italians and spaniards escaping the august heat . 
  even though i 'm from such a tiny country , i still ca n't participate . 
  here are some pics of irish lakes : glendalough , co.wicklow : http://teenagates.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/glendaloughlakea.jpg lough allen co.leitrim / roscommon : http://loughallenbasin.com/a_21_lough_allen_reflections600.jpg lough dan , co.wicklow : http://www.anirishanglersworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/lough_dan.jpg lough key , co.roscommon : http://aisleighguesthouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/lough-key-park.jpg lough ree , co.longford / westmeath/roscommon : http://discovertheshannon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/lough-ree.jpg lough owel , co.westmeath : http://mullingar.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/lough-owel-1_smaller.jpg lough derg ( shannon . ),

  there are more lakes anyways as well . 
  for children it would probably be roy and the mad cows . 
  probably the sunday game as well , just showing hurling to the masses of the continent . 
  also for adults ( well lots of youth watch it . ), 
  for comedy it would be callan 's kicks and for wildlife it would be living the wildlife by colin stafford-johnson . 
  edit : the sunday game could go in adults , because it 's for everybody . 
  in the uk yes , but not in ireland . 
  in northern ireland there is so much poverty compared to ireland . 
  i thought budapest would be much lower . 
  poverty was really bad in it when i was there 3 years ago . 
  there were very rich people in it , but there was no middle class . 
  i do n't want to have neighbourhoods with class , but they happen . 
  for example isil fighters are often radicalised by being cut off from society . 
  they do n't get to integrate and it negatively affects them . 
  it 's a pretty relaxed place . 
  it 's not as posh as greystones or dalkey , which makes it a better place to live or visit imho . 
  it excludes half the world though . 
  people in ireland seem to be much happier than our uk counterparts . 
  small countries seem to do better than these federations . 
  immigration has been quite successful in ireland so far compared to other european countries . 
  the way to keep it that way is to try and stop sections of society from ghettoising themselves . 
  we do n't want to have the immigrant neighbourhoods that you have in places like sweden . 
  wexford . 
  kilkenny and bray have been discovered by tourists ( i live in bray and on the seafront it 's not just locals and people from inner city dublin anymore . ), 
  and are continually featured in foreign newspapers , and are extensively covered in travel guides . 
  youghal is also unappreciated , as is sligo . 
  i 'm not that sure . 
  it seems like that they are just going to accept the quotas and hope for the best that cherbourg or roscoff does n't turn in to calais . 
  i 'm starting german soon . 
  italian sounds the nicest . 
  spanish is easy but i do n't like how it sounds . 
  this is a great idea . 
  i do love orangutans myself . 
  #greece for nordic, 
  orban would join the war games anyways . 
  as in fly a flag . 
  i heard they are usually used by chinese tourists . 
  flies the estelada . 
  they make nice chips . 
  one of my local fish 'n' chips shop are run by albanians and croatians . 
  they say they hire everybody from the balkans but serbs !, 
  we can take kosovo and albania instead . 
  there 's serbian eu membership gone . 
  if he recognised the state of palestine i would allow him . 
  saying that palestine is not a country is like saying that transylvania should be a part of germany . 
  we 're not northern european . 
  we 're a proud member of piigs . 
  ( well the dublin area . ), 
  50,000 $ = well it 's good if you want to live in a shack .

  http://imgur.com/a/nlsef that 's my one for ireland . 
  i do n't think the limerick tourist office would like it though . 
  this is the view i have on the metro from my suburb to dublin city centre : http://www.fitzpatrickcastle.com/upload/slide_images/attractions-11.jpg, 
  lithuania has been taken over by the rastas !, 
  in sicily ( i know this from being there this year . ), 
  around the port of augusta there 's miles upon miles of chemical plants . 
  wages are n't great there and the cost of living is high so i would say germany would be a better bet . 
  another big thing would be what languages you can speak ? 
  it would be much easier integrating into a country if you spoke the language . 
  because you do n't have the nordic influences that estonia has or the polish influences that lithuania has . 
  lithuania has a very small russian minority compared to ye or estonia . 
  r/europe and r/travel have merged together . 
  i know . 
  and their celebrities are so nonchalant . 
  i mean where would you get a-list celebrities hanging out in internet caf\u00e9s ? 
  what do you want to study or work in ? 
  if you say wanted your own vineyard italy or spain would be for you but if you wanted to work in tech you should go to ireland or estonia . 
  irish stew . 
  i hate it . 
  i last ate it years ago .
