  the `` irish '' ethnic group would still be the largest ethnic group . 
  there would just be higher proportions of other ethnic groups . 
  sounds like a good enough idea . 
  we could choose somewhere like lebanon for the middle east and djibouti for africa . 
  one . 
  he lives in malta for tax reasons 2 . 
  he controls a part of this shitty newspaper that has articles like the sun but calls itself broadsheet called `` the irish independent . '', 
  ( nothing like the real english independent . ), 
  he also owns many radio stations . 
  he virtually controls the mobile phone networks of many countries in the caribbean , central america and pacific . 
  his company is called `` digicel . '', 
  him and telenor ( a norwegian telecom company , which was state owned at the time . ), 
  had dodgy dealings with a politician to get licences for esat digifone , formerly o2 and now 3 . 
  he also owns topaz , a petrol station chain and owns the irish operations of shell and statoil . 
  these are some facts that might make the situation a bit clearer . 
  city is london . 
  for country i would go the netherlands . 
  i 'm irish and us and luxembourg are the highest on a per capita basis . 
  ( we have the highest foreign born but it 's really easy to get citizenship . ), 
  my own town has a population of about 35,000 and it 's very multicultural . 
  in about 20 years time we 'll be having this discussion and it will be ireland . 
  i 'm really happy that we are becoming so multicultural . 
  atm about 1 in 5 are foreign born but in dublin it would be 1 in 3 . 
  do you not realise that you were fighting on the side of an alliance that killed so many innocent civilians . 
  nanking , holocaust . ), 
  well they are frowned upon by the government to some extent . 
  there are so many wwi events but very few wwii events . 
  jesus nobody should have to suffer death at such a young age . 
  immigration thread 45000 why did germany and italy not have more kids ? 
  catholicism used to have a role in irish politics . 
  now it 's been thrown away nearly completely . 
  there is some party called the catholic democrats who have a mad woman as their leader . 
  renua is probably the closest party with a td in the d\u00e1il to the church . 
  even they have openly gay members . 
  we did n't get involved . 
  lots of irish fought for the brits but were and still are near frowned upon . 
  same with the nazi supporters . 
  german, 
  the way you know it is n't china is there would be 10x as many people on the beach in china . 
  and they could n't have the fences or there would be a crush . 
  irish here . 
  probably italy and spain . 
  i talk really fucking loud . 
  we ( as in irish peeps . ), 
  also like eating alfresco , when it 's sunny . 
  we have clothes that you would only ever need in somewhere like death valley . 
  i was wondering where all those weird fences on the beach in ireland came from . 
  it 's the poles who have them !, 
  it 's actually 16 degrees in reykjavik today . 
  i mean 16 for iceland is like 25 for ireland . 
  not really . 
  i feel more european than irish . 
  i have scottish , french , german and dutch descent for example . 
  the country has too many connections with the catholic church . 
  france does n't for example . 
  brussels is my capital more than dublin . 
  completely different . 
  this one was on about a gazillion times last year . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=img-ekdxice here 's an ad by smithwick 's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_ewvknvroa here 's a `` vintage '' one .

  what is todoroslavia ? 
  was in nova gorica on a day trip before from treviso . 
  lot 's of it looked horrible . 
  https://www.google.ie/maps/@45.956217,13.64783,3a,75y,150.46h,92.08t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s4zmrusl3dnozj24nfnahow!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=en budapest was really clean but there were homeless people everywhere . 
  the people who are doing it are likely people from rural areas who rarely go to a place with a population above 10,000 . 
  they are afraid of their own shadow . 
  ** ireland ** we found out our economy is growing very fast . 
  so we 'll be swimming in cash again . 
  and we 'll buy up all of your apartments . 
  http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/irish-economic-recovery-continues-with-6-5-growth-1.2301940 our government is unpopular , as ever . 
  fine gael are down to 24 % with the previous government of fianna f\u00e1il hot on their tail on 23 http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/fine-gael-drops-five-points-in-new-opinion-poll-1.2304894 the trial of the young innocent irish man ibrahim halawa in egypt for protesting was postponed for the 8th time . 
  http://www.thejournal.ie/ibrahim-halawa-trial-egypt-2249340-aug2015/ an afghan migrant was injured during a prison riot . 
  he has since claimed asylum . 
  ( since the article was written . ), 
  http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/afghan-man-found-on-m7-injured-during-cloverhill-riot-1.2301969 the government is considering axing the $ 100 water conservation grant and rising water bills by up to 50 % . 
  http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/water/irish-water-crisis/water-bills-could-rise-by-50pc-and-100-grant-facing-axe-as-eu-report-hits-home-31419570.html ireland won their highest ever medal tally at the 2015 special olympics world games in los angeles . 
  portugal would also be much better than romania imo . 
  wages are low but decent enough and prices are really low . 
  the people are so laid back as well . 
  foxrock , donnybrook/ballsbridge ( especially ailesbury road/shrewsbury road . 
  ) , killiney/dalkey ( especially vico/sorrento . 
  but the bad areas would be much better than eastern europe . 
  bad areas are tallaght , finglas , ballymun , darndale , abbey street/o ` connell street . 
  i live in bray which has a bad reputation and if you look at it it looks great . 
  a lot of it 's bull . 
  dublin is pretty safe . 
  ( irish people who contributed to this are probably people who live in some village of 10 people and go to the city for shopping on the 8th december . ), 
  i 'm happy i live in dublin , compared to say bucharest or even tallinn , which is above dublin . 
  le figaro is a right-wing paper . 
  it 's like asking berlusconi and le pen supporters what they think . 
  this is one of the best videos i 've seen for showing a trip . 
  you could take part of yours and one or two other people 's videos and create an eu tourism advert . 
  it would definitely make americans , japanese , koreans , australians etc. 
  want to come to this amazing continent . 
  i can fly to so many places in less then 3 hours . 
  from bologna to brussels . 
  dubrovnik to my own city of dublin there are so many lovely places to walk around and laze about . 
  the only problem is some countries ( like my own ireland . ), 
  have n't preserved old buildings , but the vast majority ( such as italy , france and spain . ), 
  i feel more european than irish and love my continent .
