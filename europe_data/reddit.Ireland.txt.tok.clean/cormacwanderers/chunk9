  aer lingus is owned by bloody brits and spaniards anyways . 
  it 's ryanair but more expensive . 
  ryanair all the bleedin ' way . 
  irish labour = blairites social democrats = basically more like corbyn . 
  man united fans . 
  ( they were chelsea last season and man city the season before . ), 
  the rugby fans that spend the whole game at the bar in the stadium watching tv . 
  male hockey fans . 
  what 's the craic ? 
  we could have a liberal union of ireland , the netherlands , sweden and portugal among others . 
  i thought england has won the rwc every time and that they also always win the 6 nations !? 
  maybe i 've been watching a bit too much bbc and itv . 
  are n't they also the brazil of europe at soccer ? 
  i would say no , no , no . 
  newfoundland would be much more of a brother nation . 
  it has irish culture and it 's an island at similar enough latitude with fishing industries just like ours . 
  wales , catalonia . 
  maybe even brittany , maybe even portugal . 
  well basically anywhere that had an independence movement or that irish people just have an affection for . 
  even bloody marine le pen is to the left of cruz/trump/palin . 
  by us standard yes , but they are n't by eu standards . 
  fg/ff are centre to centre right , renua are right-wing etc. 
  even labour are definitely not left-wing . 
  the social democrats , but i 'm semi-realistic so i know that wo n't happen . 
  a lefty government would be the best , but that would have to include ff or fg . 
  fingers crossed fg do n't get back in . 
  unlikely : ireland will be a polish speaking country . 
  `` polski sklep '' will replace `` newsagent '' on the street corner . 
  loads of shit . 
  more likely : we still speak english . 
  we stay independent . 
  we have a population of 10 million or something , thanks to immigration . 
  complete mix of cultures . 
  where i live there 's been loads of koreans lately . 
  in less than 3 months a load have just come in . 
  ( the number is increased though by korean students learning english and korean tourists . ), 
  everybody in ireland has been on tv once anyways . 
  me was when i was 7 or 8 and celebrating at a domestic cup match . 
  well i saw some of them on rte news the next week as an example of refugees . 
  i 've seen 10 refugees max . 
  yeah . 
  that 's basically it . 
  i played floorball here in primary school . 
  it 's a good way to learn the basics for other stick sports . 
  people who do n't have children . 
  there 's some stereotype of our new immigrants from the former warsaw bloc that they ca n't speak english !? 
  i find it hard not have some oul wan talk to me at the bus stop . 
  what about ireland though ? 
  are we not star pupils with 54.2 ? 
  i 'm taking to this the settled version of pavee point . 
  it is discrimination that the tinkers have lower roaming surcharges .

  the beliebers are the only ones who have the internet . 
  that picture was actually taken at midday . 
  refugee crisis will continue . 
  hungary will leave eu because of it and will join the eurasian economic union . 
  huge protests causes tension in hungary . 
  cyprus will finally reunify . 
  turkey 's eu membership bid will be abandoned after turkish outrage at the peace deal . 
  eu and most european countries recognise iraqi kurdistan and palestine as independent countries . 
  if uk hold it 's eu referendum in 2016 it votes to leave the eu . 
  this makes sense as illnesses such as measles can spread like wildfire around young children . 
  a head of government of an eu state . 
  somebody european who 's fighting against daesh . 
  tim peake or another esa astronaut . 
  a current or former olympian . 
  a current or former euros player . 
  ( if it 's current i do n't really mind but if it 's former it just has to be heskey ! ), 
  we should also have debates where user can join in : stuff like a podemos politician against a french fn politician . 
  debate over uk leaving eu , future eu accession etc. 
  i agree . 
  ukraine is nearly at war again and turkey 's southern neighbour syria has been on the news for five years non-stop . 
  iraq is also completely unstable for the last 12 years , thanks partly to some european countries and murica 's plan to just start a war and do nothing . 
  anywhere with coastline will be able to join so germans can put towels on those sunloungers . 
  especially ukraine and montenegro and anywhere with empty russian sunloungers . 
  i doubt anybody would 've wanted to live in east germany 30 years ago . 
  the syrian refugees would be going to italy or somewhere instead . 
  if they are talking about that shite rumour in dublin then they are better off read the sunday sport for their information . 
  most people have dark brown / black hair . 
  in the west of ireland country/western music is as popular as in the deep south of the usa . 
  it rains more in porto than in dublin . 
  we 're pretty rich again . 
  ` buys apartment block in bulgaria ', 
  complete plot twist : animalist party against mistreatment of animals , the humanist party and the internationalist solidarity and self management party form a coalition . 
  an ip address blocker to stop you voting for your own country would have helped . 
  2015 's been a pretty good year in ireland . 
  2016 's going to be better . 
  we 're going to win the treble of the six nations , euros and the eurovision . 
  ( three six nations in a row would be a record . 
  also f ** k you sweden . 
  your crappy electro house gnome things are trying to take our record of us for the eurovision . 
  you have also become a 3rd world american-standard education hellhole . 
  hope that puts it nicely . ), 
  we also need to turn dublin into amsterdam ii and decriminalise drugs like portugal . 
  if there 's a good summer we 'll be high anyway . 
  edit : i voted for germany .
