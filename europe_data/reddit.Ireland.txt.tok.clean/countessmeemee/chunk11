  it did n't work anyway , within a few years they went completely native and intermarried . 
  as the books say `` they became more irish than the irish themselves '', 
  they 're both allowed , according to the standards . 
  i did a oogoogley . 
  but the line ( also quick oogoogley ) or vinculum  , we do use for different functions , especially in algebra . 
  michael d as president and nicola as taoiseach/first minister , that is a dream team . 
  i did n't know that either . 
  i 'm in ireland . 
  maybe it 's like the comma/point for decimals . 
  i guess it does n't really need iso though , if you saw it written either way , you 'd understand what it meant . 
  [ this is what i learned ] ( https://www.google.ie/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;rlz=1c5chfa_engb671gb673&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=recurring+symbol+maths&amp;* ), 
  do you do lines ? 
  we always did a dot on top of the number . 
  but i use a 2.27 instead of 2,27 i 'd do it like this : . 
  i really tried to get the recurring symbol right . 
  i 'm waiting for the next person to format it correctly . 
  it 's tr\u00e9s important , you know . 
  could be the difference between norsemen and normans . 
  the french gave us the normans , via denmark and a few generations incubation in normandy . 
  you guys were the norse and a few hundred years earlier . 
  actually , it is 2.272727272727272 * popes per km2 . 
  northern ireland ... scotland . 
  the union of craic !!, 
  sure , they were our allies against the brits , them and the spaniards , and they gave us the normans . 
  you 'd be surprised how many words in modern irish are french in origin . 
  we could do with some of their trains . 
  yeah , definitely parnell . 
  good call , not just home rule but the land league . 
  and daniel o'connell for catholic emancipation and sufferage in westminster . 
  there are many more ... most of our heroes were not government . 
  add more . 
  i thought of another one , the first woman elected to parliament but as a sinn f\u00e9in member she did not take her seat , countess constance markievicz , also a lieutenant in the irish army in 1916 . 
  wolfe tone , robert emmet , o'laory , people from 1798 rebellion . 
  thomas clarke , thomas mcdonagh , p\u00e1draig pearse , james connolly , plunkett , ceannt . . basically , all the leaders of the 1916 rising who were executed by the british . 
  michael collins . 
  this is brilliant . 
  reminds me so much of [ this ] ( http://www.namenerds.com/uucn/realmeanings.html ), 
  american military worship is fucking scary . 
  yes , in ireland we have poit\u00edn . 
  it 's made out of potatoes and my dad gets a few massive office size water bottle every christmas , which sit behind the couch in the room no-one uses and as of the last time i wandered in there they were still untouched . 
  my image of a typical drinker of poit\u00edn is an old bachelor farmer who has distilled his own in a rusty shed . 
  it 's very easy to get in galway if you want it , i just do n't really know who actually wants it . 
  ypu can just buy vodka in aldi cheaply anyway if you want strong , straight liquor . 
  lots of people say it 's good for making rubs when you have colds and chest infections and stuff . 
  lots of people make it out my way , even though it 's illegal , although the police definitely do n't give a fuck . 
  most young people probably brew their own beer instead . 
  personally i think the stuff is horrid . 
  like drinking acetone . 
  also a two party system where the two parties are more similar than different . 
  how are you fighting back ? 
  i know trump did n't win a majority or anything but it looks more like the electoral and political system has been taken advantage by the worst possible candidate . 
  what is being done and how is it working ? 
  except the us has very little freedom . 
  my understanding of american exceptionalism , having never heard the term before , is that americans think they have a greater amount of freedom and liberty and opportunity when actually they have a whole lot less than anyone in europe , canada , australia etc. 
  i would assume the term refers to the fact that us citizens do n't seem to have a clue about their own situation , probably as a result of being bombarded with propaganda on their entertainment news shows, 
  i meant `` land of the free '' rhetoric , as in , there 's absolutely nothing free about the us . 
  i 've never heard the term before but i would assume it 's the believe held by americans that everything in the us is superior to everywhere else , whilst the opposite is actually the case . 
  land of the free stuff . 
  more . 
  more . 
  eta : more puppy !, 
  share him , please . 
  but how many frenchies snuss ? 
  that sounds so perfectly descriptive . 
  created using sauna sweat collected from the orangest of lodges . 
  freestaytos , of course . 
  [ best flavour ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?q=smokey+bacon+taytos&amp;rlz=1c5chfa_engb671gb673&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewix0kcom9tsahxlcsakhbkjdeoq_auibigb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=613&amp;dpr=1#imgrc=cpmcghriazws9m: ) wait , how the hell do you know about this sectarian debacle ? 
  yes . 
  scotland will get a second referendum . 
  i believe that once the scottish government submit a section 30 to westminster , they 're sort of obliged to . 
  i mean , it 's up to their discretion but they 're not able to deny them the opportunity to have a second referendum . 
  the longer may withholds the referendum date , the more people she is likely to convert to the yes side . 
  she seems totally fucking nuts and deluded , so i would n't put this past her . 
  or if it is medically required , in which case the boy would be about 8 or 9 anyway . 
  wrong . 
  it 's wrong . 
  it 's pointless and mutilating . 
  the tiny little yellow wedges that come on pizza . 
  the stereotype is that scots are mean in the sense that they 're not generous with their money , presbyterianism and calvanism and all that . 
  they 're not though . 
  i think they are sincere but i do n't think it 's apologism . 
  they are recognising something that happened in the past and are identifying it as point blank wrong . 
  there 's no doubt that , as a society they have moved far beyond all of that . 
  ireland is shockingly expensive . 
  yeah , i saw some bog bodies in the national museum in dublin . 
  i had seen pictures of one of them in my english poetry book as seamus heaney had written a poem about them . 
  up close , it 's really interesting because you can make out all the minor details , like the shape of his lips , his wrinkles and his nails . 
  quite cool . 
  [ this is one ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?q=national+museum+dublin+bog+bodies&amp;client=tablet-android-samsung&amp;source=android-browser&amp;prmd=imnv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi7wnw1ksnsahxfb8akhqlkdrgq_auibygb&amp;biw=962&amp;bih=601#imgrc=ki4ntronfy4zam: ), 
  anonymously . 
  roma gypsies from romanians and other eastern europeans , yes . 
  irish travellers from the rest of the population ? 
  yes . 
  i vaguely remember this too but have a strong inclination that it was on family guy . 
  in ireland , unless someone dangerously cuts you off or displays really shitty driving skills and nearly causes an accident , it 's considered kinda rude to beep . 
  people may give dirty looks if they 're pissed off for cheeky or selfish driving practices , like cutting in , usually just get dirty looks and side eye , if anything at all . 
  yes , of course . 
  why should n't they . 
  many polish and romanian people have come to other countries to work . 
  they are entitled to work if they are given jobs .
