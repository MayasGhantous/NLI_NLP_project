  there may be many more reasons , that does not mean they are valid reasons . 
  for example , the church funded anti abortion groups cite many reasons against abortion . 
  however , most , if not all , are not based on fact and rather based on religious arguments , lies and a disregard for the possible circumstances of the woman who may want an abortion . 
  they have also banned emotive imagery from the citizens assembly on abortion after an influx of disturbing imagery from bith irish and american anti abortion lobby groups . 
  there may be a thousand reasons against something , it does n't mean they are the right reasons or even true reasons . 
  i would be interested to know why 3 % of the women who sought and abortion were refused and what happened . 
  good . 
  should be a reason for anyone to be able go stop a pregnancy . 
  in ireland they would probably be fine referring you but you have to pay for your consulatant . 
  because it 's a paying system , you 'd probably be seen relatively quickly . 
  i do n't want to be pregnant and have a child ? 
   more a fashion trend than common sense most of the protestors may or may not have been students or whatever , but it 's not a trend . 
  it is common sense to allow abortion and allow the people who are pregnant decide whether or not they want to utilise the service . 
   basically what i 'm trying to say is the pro life group is mostly normal people who believe that our opinions if not heard will be overlooked you are entitled to your opinions but your opinions should n't be allowed to affect other people 's choices . 
  particularly when the procedure is widely available to women in ireland by traveling or using abortion pills . 
  perhaps since the anti abortion sides ' voice is currently the status quo in ireland and their rhetoric uses emotive imagery and false information , it is necessary for the other side to counter this . 
  there is a case in ni where a woman was convicted for getting the abortion pills for her daughter . 
  not the republic though . 
  why do n't you believe that ? 
  de valera was opus dei and used to meet with the archbishop of dublin when writing the constitution ? 
  we need a new party . 
  ff and fg are basically the same . 
  no-one reasonable can justifh voting for sf and the rest are too insignificant or non sensical to matter . 
  we need a party that is left wing but not a total loolah , loop fest . 
  a party that has actual policies on economy and ministers who act in response to their remit . 
  we have nothing to fill this void . 
  irish politics swing right from ff to sf and then the leftiness goes way off the charts . 
  the irony is , the policies the left lefties work for are usually things the major title of the population would actually want . 
  if they had more power , maybe the government would work . 
  right now fg can basically ignore them and continue doing nothing . 
  guarded like [ this ?

  yep . 
  this is it . 
  constitutional stranglehold . 
  i agree . 
  i think our population is generally liberal but our government is not . 
  no , it 's to do with religious rhetoric in the constitution .

  penises penetrate and penetrate is what communists do and communists use mind control with pens because even children have been brainwashed into saying the word and using a pen , which contains the root of penguin and penis , thus , marie le pen is a large phallic symbol controlled by aliens who hate god . 
  think about it . 
  i 'm actually also known as the cuntess of phallic intergalactic penetrative communications , so i know what i 'm talking about .

  he was one of the leaders of the 1916 rising . 
  the stuff you think is left wing propaganda is part of state celebrations of the centenary of the 1916 rising . 
  usually , liberty hall is just an ugly glass building like in the pic . 
  some trade union stuff for the 1913 lockouts , which is pretty important for siptu , but , no , they do n't just hang left wing propaganda off the building . 
  just those two and you can be fairly certain that even the right wing grannies agreed with the sentiment .

  and give more support to greece , who are already broke and the first line for refugees . 
  they 're at breaking point and they are members of the eu . 
  help our brothers and sisters out . 
  that was an april fools . 
  good one though , since it is the biggest trade union hq . 
  this is true . 
  you make a good point and you make it well . 
  you 're literally not hitler at all . 
  the people who idolise their cats and do n't realise they 're soulless devils are fucking weirdos . 
  not hitler , just not trustworthy . 
  more than likely in possession of ** issues ** . 
  i actually would really like more of this kind of discussion on this . 
  i want to better understand the flaws within the eu , it 's set up and i also want to be able to properly discern where a local government is at fault and where the eu is causing problems . 
  so , how did juncker get his job ? 
  why does angela have so much power within the eu ? 
  is this related to imf loan repayments and does this give her leverage or is it merely an imagined over influence ? 
  that too . 
  but if they do n't like dogs and dogs do n't like them ... well , you know for sure they 're literally hitler . 
  even though ... hitler liked dogs and they appeared to like him too . 
  does n't matter . 
  literally hitler . 
  correct . 
  never trust someone who does n't love dogs , never trust someone who loves cats .
