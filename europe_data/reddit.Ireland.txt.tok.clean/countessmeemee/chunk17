  if it were a good point then both vaccination and abortion should not be allowed as they are both unnatural . 
  also , it is assumes all women who get pregnant did n't use contraception . 
  it also assumes that all abortions are as a result of an accidental pregnancy . 
  he is also assuming that people want to kill . 
  so , no . 
  he 's not making any good point . 
  no valid scientific or logical points there at all . 
  that is a particularly gruesome and insensitive picture of the swan 's corpse . 
  i hope the swans family do n't see that image . 
  yes . 
  some people want to make that choice . 
  they should be legally entitled to if they find themselves pregnant . 
  it is their body . 
  it 's been banned for years and there has been no referendum on the issue for over 32 years . 
  it 's a joke imo . 
  yes . 
  i can also french and german . 
  you see , this is what 's so hypocritical . 
  i have n't hoped the worst happens to you . 
  seeing as you advocate one unnatural method of improving life , vaccination , which we can all agree is a good thing , and then viewing another medical procedure as a bad thing , then you are in fact hypocritical in your views . 
  minority or not , women get abortions all the time . 
  it is only right that this medical procedure be legal . 
  as someone who lives in ireland where it is illegal and unavailable , i sincerely hope your views die quickly . 
  the fact that you can twist an anti abortion into an article about people who do n't vaccinate their children shows how illogical and tenuous the anti abortion logic is . 
  do n't need to . 
  i live here . 
  can confirm , everyone speaks irish here . 
  it 's called the gaeltacht , if you 'd wish to crawl out from under your uneducated rock and fact check a bit . 
  why would children sa spid\u00e9al make a video in english ? 
  we speak irish here . 
  this is a worrying new trend . 
  good . 
  this is a step in the right direction . 
  there is actually a great movement for irish tv . 
  our current president , michael d higgins , helped found an irish language station called tg4 in 1994 and it has gone from strength to strength . 
  it makes really good quality stuff , despite having a really tiny budget . 
  [ here 's a little something from their youtube channel i like showing to my niece and nephew ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr-ii0iokyi ), 
   eh , kinda , yes . 
  completely, 
  people who generally make sweeping statements of blame generally do n't know what the fuck they 're talking about . 
  i 'm aware of the irony of my general sweeping statement . 
  forgive me , i do n't know what the fuck i 'm talking about . 
  traditionally you colonise with fish and chips , but traditional italian pizza would be welcomed , so long as you swallow your pride and allow the heathen pineapple topping . 
  the war is starting . 
  on easyjet flights . 
  i do n't think there is any reason for the eu to not accept pet passports . 
  it 's a solid system requiring microchipped , vaccination and registration to get them in the first place . 
  their passports are more regulated than people ones . 
  i doubt it . 
  pet passports are pretty regulated already . 
  it 's a good , solid system already in place so once your pet is microchipped , up to date on the vaccinations and you have their passport , what other controls do they need ? 
  that would be a spiteful move and there is no call for such a thing . 
  they 're in the last place you put them . 
  you 're welcome . 
  sure , htin aung 's a history of burma is an absolutely fascinating read that covers burmese society , its worlings and structure before it was destroyed in great detail . 
  it also describes the many horrific changes the country underwent over the years . 
  interestingly , i saw aung san suu kyi being defiantly interviwed on the bbc last night . 
  i 'm not a fan of hers . 
  did you know myanmar had one of the most egalitarian societies with a 100 % literacy rate in the 18th century until the british invaded and destroyed the country solely for access to their teak . 
  is n't he the fucking foreign secretary ? 
  would go viral way quicker . 
  stronger political message . 
  do n't buy it . 
  may may be pulling her nhs move and starving scotland to make it look bad and then say `` look , it 's shit !, 
  this is all cos of your ` neverendum ' . 
  westminster have control of the scottish overall budget and their fiscal policy . 
  and , like , brexit . 
  edit , autocorrect . 
  i guess it is a simple way to highlight the issue and show solidarity . 
  that 's actually pretty patronising , if they 're not in a relationship with the man they 're holding hands with . 
  there 's more to being gay than holding hands with other men in public and taking pictures of it . 
  where is the translation ? 
  * you 're you 're welcome , american . 
  i never noticed . 
  did they change it ? 
  i stopped studying the coins years ago but i always loved the floppy dick . 
  would love to be a fly on the wall listening to the great unwashed discuss the threat of war , though, 
  no-one knows . 
  it 's a media distraction , as in the media are only reporting this bizarre and ridiculous story about spain and the uk going to war instead of benefit and tax issues . 
  it 's a media distraction . 
  that 's all . 
  benefits are being cut this week and the rich are getting lower taxes in the uk . 
  not a peep about it . 
  dimension that in a new me sent . 
  god , when will this idiot fuck off ? 
  it 's not funny anymore . 
  it 's good that they have teh second round though . 
  if i am not mistaken , that is exactly what prevented her father getting elected . . as people rallied around his opposition in the second round of voting . 
  hopefully the french will know the risks and turn out like last time . 
  it 's basically exactly how trump managed to get in as well . 
  or , well , one of many reasons, 
  was posted last week . 
  does n't make it any less amazing though . 
  farage and corbyn are my personal favourites . 
  they do change them from time to time . 
  there was one with stick people on it for a while . 
  i think they just went with the harp and that was that . 
  whoever it was that spoke had spoken .
