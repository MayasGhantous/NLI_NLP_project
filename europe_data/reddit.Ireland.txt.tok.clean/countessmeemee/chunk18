  paywall !, 
  april fools ... 
  hahahahahaha !!!!!!, 
  are n't they funny ?? 
  do i need an / s ? 
  this is genuinely terrifying . 
   alvi karimov , spokesperson for chechnya 's leader , ramzan kadyrov , described the report as `` absolute lies and disinformation '' , basing his denial on the claim that there were no gay people in chechnya . 
  `` you can not detain and persecute people who simply do not exist in the republic , '' he told interfax news agency . 
   `` if there were such people in chechnya , the law-enforcement organs would n't need to have anything to do with them because their relatives would ** send them somewhere from which there is no returning . 
  ** '' scary they also claimed the report was an april fool 's joke but i 'm not entirely convinced . 
  mule children have no rights . 
  you may express your frustration by rattling your stick against the bars of your cage . 
  if you 're creative and god chooses to enlighten you , you may even make something resembling music . 
  the pilgrims from santiago de compostela will reward you with prayers for your salvation . 
  if you 're lucky . 
  . . our strong a no majestic stag would have been perfect . 
  they can do more than one design , our central bank is just lazy . 
  i miss the pretty animals, 
  so , how does society progress ? 
  by getting one thing done at a time or waiting for another tenuously related issue to pass before the next one can ? 
  why not do them at the same time ? 
  or one after the other ? 
  why does one issue preclude another from getting through ? 
  probably something that should be over and done with though , so then it 's not an issue for when more important topics do arise and for many people this is an important topic that most people would not be opposed to . 
  neither . 
  you 'd be confined to a cage hanging over spain along with other mule children . 
  that david bowie is impressive as fuck . 
  i do n't know ... but what i would like to see discussed more , which i think is clouded as a result of brexit and all that shite , is more conversation on what 's wrong with the eu . 
  i think we can all agree that it has problems and requires reform but i would like to know more about which problems it has etc. . . 
  although , i think the real problem preventing this discourse is the fact that most of the articles being published lately are related to brexit and often they can sound ridiculous , which ends up being people ripping ridiculous enough statements to shreds and the real issues within the eu are ignored because they 're not topical . 
  tldr i 'm pro eu because i think the eu is better than what was there before , not because it 's perfect but i 'd actually love to hear more debate about the pros and cons , the problems , the reforms necessary , as opposed to debating the eu in relation to brexit crap , which tends to make people sound like they 're dogmatic eu cult followers . 
  is it only an april fools thing ? 
  i could have sworn it 's been up earlier than just a day . 
  this happened last year too ? 
  is this confusing , brightly coloured pixel war now a permanent fixture ? 
  or is it due to expire at some point ? 
  there 's one person . 
  she 's very nice . 
  she 's called fatima . 
  it 's not like i have an active interest in it 's destruction or anything and i quite enjoy [ norton 's commentary ] ( https://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3fv%3dna6i9yxjgtq&amp;ved=0ahukewjqyb7pgittahwjhsakhsf4cb4qo7qbcbkwaa&amp;usg=afqjcnhrgd7gzbt_0uivckwfj_ucvmcpnq&amp;sig2=gkpqdb62hw5w_djilal3eg ) . . 
  i 'm just saying . 
  i would n't be devastated . 
  we 're just a teeny weeny little bit wary of your social experiments ... 
  from what i gather it 's a chair conducting research on his particular teachings consisting of the names listed in links provided on this thread ... about 8 names or so , many of them typically western names . 
  although it does seem an infiltration on the part of his movement , which appears to target academia anyway , it does appear to be a legitimate university research group , in so far as arts students ' research is legitimate . 
  i tend to not have much academic respect for this kind of wishy washy research anyway , since i did a genuine degree . 
  so , judging by this and other comments , he 's basically an absent turkish cult leader of an islamic movement , a wealthy , capitalist business man , at odds with erdogan but also at odds with integration in the west who is expanding his brand through the establishment of his own type of charter schools ? 
  it sounds very dodgy and very cult like . 
  almost like he 's a direct competitor of erdogan but using different methods ? 
  how much lebensraum do you really need ? 
  a turkish person just sent me [ this ] ( https://www.city-journal.org/html/who-fethullah-g%c3%bclen-13504.html ) ... 
  i 'm just reading it now but they said it 's a bit old and obviously it 's directed at americans . 
  also some shit about pineapples , which may be a code word for something else . 
  i think everyone enjoys ripping on erdogan because he 's particularly ridiculous . 
  it 's difficult at this point to take any of his actions seriously as he has a track record of doing crazy things . 
  but , what exactly is this university 's link to g\u00fclen ? 
  i do n't understand all this pixel shit . 
  so gulen is what ? 
  an islamic extremist recruiting academics ? 
  or infiltrating academia ? 
  i am sorry to admit my ignorance but i 've never heard of gulen . 
  he used to use quite the cork accent ... [ as father noel furlomg ] ( https://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3fv%3dlk_-e2ebrrq&amp;ved=0ahukewjz1un9syptahusdmakhebta70qwqsbccewaq&amp;usg=afqjcngcuxmvtflezyjlyd1ftrebrnpwnw&amp;sig2=vq3ud4oefq4blrmz93cavg ) , which was exaggerated . . he seems to have always had a neutral all-ireland accent , [ apparently lying about being at a disco when he was 17 , according to graham himself ] ( https://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3fv%3d5o5ceeorfm4&amp;ved=0ahukewjguipssoptahvsacakhen3a60qo7qbcbkwaa&amp;usg=afqjcnffbkjvi-2slikf1gxhal81m3jkhw&amp;sig2=-gkfluetnp2enxqrhjxfdq ) he has a neutral enough accent but you can still pick up on the cork now and again . 
  well , he is wrong to nullify people 's educations , but i see your point about the gulen thing . 
  i went to a catholic university too ... ucd , dublin . 
  nothing catholic about it except that it was founded as a university that catholics could attend , as at one time you had to be protestant to attend trinity . 
  is this a joke ? 
  it 's hard to tell today ... 
  fuck , that is a substantial amount . 
  how many people are on the list ? 
  how do they even know who their supporters are ? 
  if i were them , i 'd forget the savings and stick to my dutch passport . 
  if only it were n't april fools ... cos that is one european organisation that i would n't mind crumbling . 
  plus , i do n't think the uk should be allowed to use graham norton anymore . 
  farage in the control room playing with his tongue ... hehehe the bobble heads are so good . 
  tomorrow he will announce that all europeans are banned from ingesting turkish delight . 
  now this reasonable young lad has his own bank account that everyone with an account there contributes to . 
  nothing to worry about at all . 
  oh , jebus . . not a positive turn of events . 
  i 'm assuming this is their turkish accounts ? 
  are they just frozen or does the supreme turkish commander now have access to their funds as well ? 
  this may be an unpopular opinion but i do n't think this erdogan is a very nice or very sensible fellow . 
  i think he 's very silly . 
  silly man . 
  silly billy . 
  i guess syrians probably do n't have great wifi right now . 
  [ i bet this was their inspiration ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?ie=utf-8&amp;client=tablet-android-samsung&amp;source=android-browser&amp;q=scotland+eu+butterfly+poster&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=dnzewnihkcsigaa2pkpydw#gws_rd=cr&amp;imgrc=5tol9zumbu_cbm: ), 
   farage could well be an absolute prick behind the facade , who knows . 
  i 'm not trying to be sarcastic or rude but ... is n't he an obvious prick in front of the facade ? 
  `` hate mo\u011flu '', 
  that 's pretty fucking insulting . 
  went off to get married . 
  they 're helped in every way possible . 
  they 've just secured minority status as a distinct ethnicity . 
  it 's not the states fault that they emphatically choose to live the way they do . 
  wow , fascinating . 
  i know this one is completely psychological but i do remember a town in russia where people contracted a bizarre sleeping disease that , iirc , was caused by some effluent from a disused mine of some description . 
  travellers . 
  ... well , if you pull your kids out of school and ensure they 're illiterate and claims that 's cultural , there is n't much more to do . 
  the culture that they wish to maintain is not going to make doctors , accountants or engineers . 
  yeah , we kinda figured .
