  barry 's original red box tea . 
  the only acceptable answer in ireland . 
  when i was younger we used to call them yo-yos . 
  i do n't anymore though . 
  just refer to everything in euro . 
  it infuriates me when people call it euros . 
  yeah , but it 's not likely that a country that does n't allow abortion would allow euthanasia . 
  literally everyone looks moderate in comparison to the dup . 
  literally everyone . 
  ireland does n't allow it . 
  personally , i agree with euthanasia and think it should be allowed . 
  however we still do n't even have abortion so ... 
  catalina ponor . 
  i just think she 's great . 
  maybe she actually just wanted to retire so she pulled this election stunt thing to get someone else in for her . 
  she is pretty inept . 
  he 'll take you skateboarding in the park after , just to prove he stills believes in you and to explain why he needed to be so stern just then . 
  and loads of them were older scumbags too . 
  the ` no surrender ' mess of a woman was easily in her sixties . 
  all the main actors in that movie were irish , except for the crazy irish guy , who was actually the only scot . 
  it 's a great one because it 's a rabbit hole , but it 's not really a conspiracy theory . 
  you 're not relying on whacky alternatives . 
  you 're actually just learning stuff that 's pretty obvious . 
  her mother did have an affair with him and everything . 
  it 's documented . 
  you can see the resemblance and the stories add up . 
  great rabbit hole , highly recommended . 
  aristocrats are always so fucking one another . 
  yeah . 
  it 's literally cos gibson filmed the whole thing in ireland and used the irish army base and the irish army as extras . 
  the curragh is really wide and really flat and they did n't seem to think to build a set . 
  the whole reason the scots won that battle is cos the english got bottlenecked . 
  in the braveheart version the two armies just go one to one , with the massive english army with far superior artillery mysteriously being beaten by the scots just standing around . 
  ooh , the squidgy gate and camilla tapes were hilarious . 
  also , check out the diana 's real dad being james goldsmith . 
  which means diana 's half brother is zac goldsmith who won back the tory seat from the library dems on a recount today . 
  jemima khan would be diana 's half sister under this scenario also . 
  the similarities in photos alone is quite convincing . 
  also prince harry 's paternity . 
  but i 'm pretty convinced just by looking at photos of hewitt , so i dunno if that counts as a conspiracy . 
  i recommend watching dup and their constiuents on youtube clips of the stephen nolan show . 
  just to get an insight into their legendary sectarianism , evasivess answering , whataboutism , fleggery and obsession with the ira . 
  it 's the only way to understand them , you could n't quite believe how bad they are if you have n't seen them and their mindset in action . 
  they 're so cringey and outrageous , but what else could you expect from people who want to `` save ulster from sodomy '' and believe the world is 7,000 years old . 
  [ this one is about the fleg protests , it 's a good one ] ( https://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3fv%3dfc5l5p6ayym&amp;ved=0ahukewjdx8323bhuahvilsakhdardjyqwqsbcb4waa&amp;usg=afqjcnh-5r_zpko1tsqgbfhhuvjl9ffzhw&amp;sig2=y2fa4zjf5rtnk56-yqgvdg ), 
  i think it 's brilliant . 
  everyone in the rest of the uk are gon na find out how ridiculous and unreasonable the dup are . 
  i think they 'll embarrass themselves and draw a spotlighto onto them , ultimately winning more support for nationalism in ni and probably playing into the arms of sinn f\u00e9in by highlighting the ineptitude . 
  one is quite amused . 
  lots of filipino nurses and carers in ireland . 
  i think they get along fine . 
  no dangers to be aware of in ireland , as such . 
  it 's such an odd `` tradition '' . 
  earrings on babies look so trashy . 
  is it a relatively recent phenomenon ? 
  that 's bizarre . 
  i never even heard of it . 
   however , hospitals do pierce the ears of all little girls at birth . 
  you literally need to fight the nurse not to get baby 's ears pierced . 
  why ? 
  would that be religious then ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  so , someone wanted every boy to get a circumcision and every girl to have their clitoris removed with acid ? 
  why ? 
  afaik there are no laws against it , but no-one would get it done to their child unless they 're muslim or jewish . 
  most hospitals only perform medical circumcision , so parents would have to take their infant to specific hospitals . 
  circumcision is a totally unnecessary cosmetic gentian mutilation . 
  if little boys suffer from phimosis , this will be diagnosed at around 8 or 9 and may result in circumcision for medical reasons . 
  if someone wants to get it done in adulthood , that 's their decision . 
  although i 'm not aware of anyone choosing a circumcision for cosmetic reasons . 
  yeah but they have absolutely no autonomy . 
  unless you count northern ireland , but that 's a different story . 
  not really , but they are used for our rugby teams , who play by province , and there will be a provincial flag at some gaa matches . 
  all four provinces are represented on [ this flag ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?q=provinces+of+ireland+flags&amp;client=tablet-android-samsung&amp;source=android-browser&amp;prmd=inmv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjogequokxuahxhamakhygkaf4q_auicsgb&amp;biw=962&amp;bih=601#imgrc=emclgxcliv-bqm: ) . 
  i use the connacht flag as my flair on r/europe , cos it 's a damn cool flag . 
  but not in real life . 
  even if i just want to ** say ** hello to you , ** tony ** ? 
  that 's not necessarily true though . 
  both have very different cultures , germany being stereotypically ordered and slightly individual , whereas greece as a more family orientated mediterranean lifestyle . 
  arguably , a greek fisherman has a better quality of life than a german farmer . 
  arguably not . 
  they 're different cultures with different positives and negatives . 
  if you do , they want to know the brand and product . 
  just saw it on the news , they 're using all the information to try to narrow down the location . 
  so , of you know what product it is , let them know and this will narrow down their search a bit , in terms of where that is available . 
  are the first two a couple of tesco bags ? 
  pearce brosnan was the irish bond . 
  like , i 'm agreeing with you , although sean connery is scottish . 
  i do n't think most people in ireland consider leo anything other than someone who is completely irish with a slight hue of tan . 
  so his dad is indian , no-one gives a fuck . 
  it 's only recently that there 's been all this bullshit about him not being white and it 's in these ridiculous articles , usually from international sources , abut how progressive he must be for being gay and not being white . 
  everyone in ireland knows he goes to sleep looking at posters of margaret thatcher . 
  he 's vaguely tan imo . 
  hence having to be told recently that he is n't . 
  it hangs outside hotels and public buildings . 
  people hang it out their windows if there 's a football match or in support of someone in the olympics or something like that . 
  that 's about it . 
  it 's just the irish flag . 
  has good symbology but i do n't think people go crazy over it . 
  oh , yeah , some people in the north burn it cos they do n't like it .
