  there is so much shit nicola sturgeon is responsible for . 
  yesterday she was responsible for the fall in sterling , no-one mentioned that may had just announced that freedom of movement would end in a month . 
  i also do n't think it 's constantly threatening a referendum . 
  she 's building up to one . 
  she is going to do it properly from her perspective . 
  you ca n't fault her for that . 
  tomorrow 's headline ... nicola sturgeon 's face is causing stormy conditions in scotland . 
  nicola sturgeon 's existence is causing brexit talks to go badly for uk . 
  not really . 
  the thing is , if you want a good job , you have to leave . 
  there is a rental and property crisis . 
  no banks are giving out mortgages . 
  there is no building going on . 
  i think people 40 + are back enjoying their cushy standards , buying new cars and can afford their mortgages , holidays and drinks and dinner out . 
  younger people are stuck between a rock and a hard place . . rent is soooo expensive for absolute shit , there is no building going on and younger people will not get mortgages for god knows how long . 
  car insurance is costing me an arm and a leg since i moved home . 
  it 's just gone up for no real reason except it can . 
  it 's a steady middle class economy but for the people who had already established it before the recession . 
  younger people have to either move home , spend all their money on rent or emigrate . 
  also , younger people get paid way less for the same jobs due to pay freezes and stuff so for the younger generation i feel like our options are pretty limited for the future here . 
  kinda have to be in europe first . 
  i think that was more an attempt to placate an irrational child throwing a tantrum ... `` there , there ... we want you to finish your homework and try to go to university ... we think it would be for up the best , do n't you think ? 
  no , you 're definitely dropping out and becoming a model even though you 're obese and ugly , okay !, 
  good luck with that ! '', 
  who is asking the uk to stay ? 
  no-one . 
  what has come from the eu is that they must not drag their heels triggering article 50 and hold everyone else to ransom . 
  but none of the newest members use the euro !, 
  anyway , with the way the uk behaved within the eu and what 's happening now , eu will be happy to see the back of em . 
  i doubt the uk will try to regain entry and if they try , i reckon they 'll be shot down by everyone else within the union . 
  you do n't need to be in schengen or the euro to be in the eu . 
  i do n't know why people keep saying that , i mean the uk is currently an eu member without using the euro or being in schengen . 
  ireland is n't in schengen either . 
  sweden , denmark , bulgaria , croatia , czech republic , hungary , poland , romania and the united kingdom do n't use the euro either . 
  neither of those things are prerequisites for the eu . 
  i do n't think they 'll let the england part back into the eu anytime soon . 
  they 're trouble makers and tantrum throwers . 
  scotland yeah , i reckon they wo n't have difficulty . 
  eu probably wo n't ever let them in again . 
  they 're toxic to the cause . 
  the french did n't want to let them join in the first place . 
  yeah , good luck with that weirdo party from a completely different nation . 
  i 'm sure that will go down swimmingly in lithuania . 
  why would they accept every eu law ? 
  i thought the idea behind brexit was to regain complete control over their own laws ... they 're really planning on accepting eu law after ? 
  the lack of logic surrounding this brexit stuff is beyond confusing . 
  next eu referendum ? 
  why ? 
  do you have smelly armpits ? 
  a city needs a city charter . 
  a town does n't have a city charter . 
  go one further , if one of your grandparents was born on the island of ireland you can get citizenship . 
  i only learned about it a few years ago so i do n't know how well known it actually is and how long ago it came out . 
  the problem with their debts is they 're being forced to consistently pay back their debts with interest when ** they have no fucking money to begin with ** . 
  northern ireland has not left yet , but ireland is staying in the eu . 
  so , you could stay in ireland as long as you wish and have full eu rights . 
  any eu country , all of them . 
  there is also free movement to switzerland , norway and iceland but switzerland is trickier for the residency . 
  well , yeah . 
  they completely cooked their books to gain entry . 
  still , they 're being royally fucked over by their loan conditions and overwhelmed with immigrants and getting no support from the eu . 
  it 's not right . 
  portuguese passport means you have eu rights everywhere in the eu . 
  you 're fine for sweden . 
  the handling of the banking crisis and the bailouts and the way greece is being fucked over , i would say it stems from a very germancentric view of how things should be done . 
  the problems were home grown but the solutions are crippling countries . 
  other acceptable answer is ** absolutely everything ** , depends on who you ask . 
  black mountain . 
  i hear it 's stunningly beautiful . 
  or the pound falls as theresa may announces that freedom of movement will end in a month . 
  tldr - absolutely nothing happened in ireland . 
  do you get immediate rights to denmark by being a lutheran ? 
  or immediate greek citizenship because your mother is greek orthodox ? 
  is there a ` birthright ' programme for these countries and religions ? 
  no , because they 're not in europe and have a very , very questionable human rights record and penchant for illegal colonisation . 
  they 've come out with this ... [ briefing ] ( https://www.freemovement.org.uk/briefing-legal-status-eu-citizens-uk/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=briefing-legal-status-eu-citizens-uk ), 
   the report did not indicate why they decided to move back to germany . 
  lol . 
  any wild guesses ? 
   the three principal groups affected :  the main group affected are eu citizens who are self sufficient but who do not have comprehensive sickness insurance . 
  this would include an eu citizen married to a british citizen where the eu citizen does not have comprehensive sickness insurance , is not currently working or self employed and has not worked or been self employed for five continuous years . 
   eu citizen students ( past or present ) are also affected where they did not have comprehensive sickness insurance . 
   other eu citizens who are physically present in the uk but not qualified persons are also affected . 
  this would include eu citizens simply living in the uk who are not having recourse to public funds but do not have comprehensive sickness insurance and street homeless eu citizens . 
  lol . 
  he describes himself as a lesbian trapped in the body of a man . 
  he 's trolling an insane scandinavia . 
  utter swamp cunts targeting the large population of thick fucks . 
  not hard to be deviant in that scenario either . 
  yup . 
  they 're appointed by the establishment . 
  it has the function of a senate yet is appointed by the establishment . 
  that 's real conflicting interests there . 
  michelle mone is a worthy example that comes to mind . 
  how has she displayed critical thinking and scrutiny and why the actual fuck is she there ? 
  how was she allowed to get there ? 
  so why not have an elected senate who can do that , instead of people appointed by those who have always held power ? 
  appointed by who ? 
  popular vote ? 
  or by people with heridatory and elected power .
