  craigavon pharmaceutical firm almac has admitted that its decision to open a factory in dundalk was as a direct result of the uk 's vote to leave europe . 
  giving evidence to the northern ireland affairs committee , the company said that it may move operations to the republic of ireland from northern ireland . 
  the group , established nearly two decades ago by the late sir allen mcclay , said border checks could impact on its ability to be competitive and that potentially having to certify a product in northern ireland and then again certify it in the republic of ireland was a concern . 
  colin hayburn , executive director of almac group and graeme mcburney , president and managing director of almac pharma services told the committee that the majority of their trades were with ireland rather than the uk . 
  certification to sell its products to ireland could add an extra # 480 to each deal . 
  the decision to open in dundalk was made just weeks after the brexit vote . 
  ulster unionist mp danny kinahan said that almac had been waiting for weeks to get a meeting with secretary of state james brokenshire . 
  `` there are two main concerns here , '' said mr kinahan . 
  `` one is that almac could not find any one in government to talk to [ with regards its brexit concerns ] . 
  and two that it has bought somewhere in dundalk because of the uncertainty surrounding the uk 's exit for europe . '', 
  the northern ireland affairs committee also took evidence from stephen kelly , manufacturing ni chief executive . 
  mr kinahan said that mr kelly told the committee that with the collapse of the northern ireland executive they were not getting the chance to get their point across to the brexit department at westminster . 
  sdlp mp alasdair mcdonnell added : `` we do n't have the structures or strategies in place to deal with brexit and that is what concerns me greatly ... 
  in northern ireland we 've had lots of conversations but no meaningful structures put in place . 
  we are depending on the british government . '', 
  last month , almac stressed its commitment to retaining its headquarters in craigavon when it announced that it would create 100 jobs in dundalk . 
  a spokesman for almac insisted : `` our base will always , always , be in craigavon . '', 
  the multi-million pound investment in a 32,000 sq ft plant dundalk has been supported by the department of jobs , enterprise and innovation through ireland 's inward investment promotion agency ida ireland . 
  it will be utilised by almac pharma services and almac clinical services , both of which are already registered to operate in the republic . 
  i love you too !, 
  it 's a buttercup . 
  une baguette avec full irish is also acceptable . 
  or chips ... chips with curry or cheese or garlic mayo or any combination of those !, 
  ffs , kebabs or falafel wraps are more common than pies !, 
  irish people eat pies ? 
  where the hell do they get this info ? 
  you eat porridge however the fuck you want to eat porridge . 
  no ham at all . 
  choose pepperoni . 
  it 's designed for pizza . 
  chorizo is nice too . 
  it 's like mushrooms , they just get all dried and shrivelled on a pizza . 
  ham is such a bad choice as a pizza topping , it just gets burned and curls up . 
  it does n't cook properly on a pizza . 
  pepperoni has the zing that a normal slice of pepperoni pizza has , but the pineapple just does a perfect job of offsetting it . 
  i am only a fish hater as a pizza topping but they 're generally nice guys on a personal level . 
  disclaimer , fao pizza fascists , my taste buds differ from other people 's taste buds so i 'm not a fish hater as a pizza topping for everyone . 
  i disagree . 
  however , i am not a pizza fascist , so i would allow you to order it on your half of the pizza instead of banning what i consider an icky choice . 
  replace ham with pepperoni . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  it is the best pizza topping . 
  goes so well with pepperoni . 
  cooling sweetness to the mild salty spice of sliced piglet . 
  how dare he ... fucking pizza fascist . 
  sort of pointier , angular , more upturned noses . 
  kind of elfen , i do n't know exactly how to describe it . 
  i do n't know , i see a distinction . 
  colouring wise , and apart from scandinavians being more blonde on average , i 'd say that colouring between the two countries is fairly similar by and large . 
  like i said , most people are exceptions and you would n't be able to pick which people are from where , but there is a nordic look . 
  basically what i meant is i do n't think the vikings had much to do with how the irish look . 
  if you visit iceland , they could well be irish but they have a nordic look too . 
  so , that 's a true mix of irish and scandinavian populations . 
  why are iceland doing so badly ? 
  i was trying to be diplomatic . 
  what i meant was stupid people are having loads of kids and more intelligent people are n't . 
  so , we 're in a state of breeding dysgenics . 
  the majority of the next batch of kids are going to be dumb . 
  probably not lookers either .

  well , i 'm irish and i 've spent a good chunk of time in scandinavia . 
  yes , most people just look individual and european and most people are exceptions but i do see a scandinavian look in scandinavian people that i do n't observe in irish people , even if two people look generally similar . 
  and i 'm not talking about hair colour or anything like that . 
  i just see a distinction . 
  that kid has some neck . 
  i like it . 
  i did n't get it when i read it . 
  i do n't get the similarities . 
  i was in iceland and it was a pretty interesting place to see some people who could have looked typically irish and some people who looked typically scandinavian . 
  but then they actually are a mix of both . 
  of course there are going to be a million and one individual exceptions , they 're both white populations . 
  but in general , i see a clear distinction between scandinavians and irish . 
  yes , they did but the specific gene that gave neanderthals red hair is not the corresponding gene that gives modern europeans red hair . 
  so , they interbred , yeah , but they were n't responsible for the current bouts of gingervitis . 
   neanderthals had a mutation in this receptor gene that has not been found in modern humans . 
  the mutation changes an amino acid , making the resulting protein less efficient . 
  modern humans have other mcr1 variants that are also less active resulting in red hair and pale skin . 
  [ from this ] ( https://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/genetics/ancient-dna-and-neanderthals/neanderthal-genes-red-hair-and-more&amp;ved=0ahukewiw2bqtjj3sahxsimakhcrtdh0qfghcmao&amp;usg=afqjcngxukqzriwvmagko0s3h55fldh7gq&amp;sig2=uko9826izhwxathqyhy12q ), 
  yeah , i know they are ... my understanding was they were the earliest europeans who were thought to have never been replaced by other people on western coasts , hence more red hair and o - blood and stuff like that . 
  . . the red haired gene that modern soulless gingers carry is not the same gene that neanderthals suffering from gingervitis carried . 
  so , even though neanderthals could be ginger , they could n't have passed that on to modern humans . 
  there is a different gene source for the disease . 
  that red hair gene is not found in modern humans though .
