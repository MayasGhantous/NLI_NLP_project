  they 're not wasting or buying any time , they 're using it . 
  the secession movement has already been sparked . 
  sturgeon and the snp are pushing for the next indy ref within two years . 
  he was never given a chance . 
  everyone is out to catch him out . 
  no matter what he does , it 's wrong and everyone is all over him and it 's broadcast everywhere . 
  he 's the leader of the opposition party . 
  the leader of the tory part does n't come under nearly as much more if any scrutiny . 
  it 's pure anti corbyn propaganda . 
  he 's a threat to their tory ideals . 
  it has no strength and it can not spark a secession movement . 
  the scots voted to remain so they 're doing all protocol within their devolved government 's power that they are able to do , even though westminster never had any intentions of listening to them and have permission from the courts to ignore them while dragging their asses out of the eu . 
  there will be a second independence referendum jn the near future . 
  i 'm just assuming stuff like this is going to hpshiw scots their place in the uk and sway a vote for independence . 
  it ca n't to shit , the supreme court has already ruled that westminster does n't need the permission of the devolved governments to trigger article 50 . 
  this , quite understandably , is pissing off the scottish government as they voted to remain and are essentially being pulled out against their will . 
  i imagine it 's purpose is to show scots that they mean business in fighting for scots rights and probably also as an act that will help build support for independence prior to their next independence referendum . 
  does n't matter . 
  the high court said it 's fine to ignore them . 
  not that they were intending on listening to them anyway . 
  corbyn was vilified by every single media outlets in the uk before he was even elected as leader . 
  i listened to bbc4 a lot , whcih is supposed to be the more political station , all they did was talked him down like a devil who liked to slice open pregnant women 's bellies when he got thirsty . 
  they really went to town on him , i could n't believe i was hearing such blatant bias from a government station . 
  problem is , most people then began spouting all that shit as their own opinion about immediately after . 
  they hate him and they have no idea why . 
  they hate him because they 've been told to hate him . 
  4 of them let it happen . 
  2 stood by while 2 acted . 
  that 's 4 sadistic fucks . 
   but i doubt all 4 are sadistic fucks . 
  really ? 
  i think they * are * 4 sadistic fucks with power who think they 're above the law because they are the law . 
  i 'm not watching that . 
   i do n't think it 's unfair to say the the 60bn has likely been inflated in the expectation that may will try to argue it down . 
  i do n't think this is how debt works . 
  it does sound like a potential counter argument that may be used to not pay lawful debts but i have difficulty believing this is actually true . 
  it sounds a lot like accusing the eu of bullying them . 
  why not ? 
  of course he did , he was sodomised with a fucking truncheon . 
  i hope they got some of it on cctv . 
  that is fucking dispicable . 
  dogs have the best hearts . 
  i think you mean `` cathearted '' !, 
  merkel and juncker were definitely down in ennis conniving to make sure this perfectly reasonable , one size fits everything wall solution would n't get the pp it so obviously deserved . 
  obviously the eu were conspiring with emplyees in planning in clare county council to piss trump off . 
  no other possible explanation . 
  that 's not how what works ? 
  the internet ? 
  i 'm afraid you 're mistaken . 
  the us . 
  imagine if al gore had been allowed to take his presidency ? 
  there are plenty of alternatives . 
  the only reason we 're so reliant on it is as a result of us interference from a us president who began a war and invasion on oil rich territories in order to gain control of one commodity and promote that over others solely due to his own and his family 's vested financial interests . 
  patient having to try several different ones before one sticks is pretty good evidence of them being little more than placebos . 
  homeopathy has pretty similar rates of success . 
  they actually have no idea how they work or if they work at all . 
  there are many possible explanations , none are definitive and the efficiacy is marginally better than placebos . 
  no child should be circumcised unless it 's medically necessary . 
  even then , i believe it takes until the child is around 7 or 8 to tell .

  all easily available info . 
  there is no evidence that flooding the brain with artifical serotonin is even taken up by the brain , for example . 
  there is absolutely no explanation as to how any anti depressant actually works , if at all . 
  it 's all conjecture based and if they work better than placebos , the effect is by marginal percentages . 
  i have read that although there is absolutely no evidence as to how they work to treat depression , they do have very real side effects . 
  this may be one piece of conjecture to explain the marginal benefits over placebos , as of a patient feels real side effects then they are able to attribute an anti depressant working . . an added placebo effect . 
  no , it 's based on dilutions of water and crystals and stuff like that . 
  it 's not like using certain herbs or home cures that might actually work ... like streaming your head for blocked sinuses . 
  it 's literally airy fairy pseudo waffle . 
  it 's the basis of most anti depressant medication . 
  there 's very little evidence that the efficacy is greater than placebo and most studies are carried out by pharmaceutical companies to promote approval . 
  i do n't know if this is true or not and i 'm not advocating for people who are taking anti depressants to stop taking them , but there is plenty of evidence that the ' 6 week rule ' for when they are supposed to work is merely the placebo effect . 
  your great grandma says hi . 
  she 's happy . 
  she says she 's very proud of you for that thing you did . 
  she says that you are at a crossroads in your life but she knows you will make the right decision . 
  although why the us needs so many bases in europe is beyond my comprehension . 
  they fight for oil , not europe 's interests . 
  in fact , they are the biggest initiators of world instability . 
  what peacekeeping missions do they partake in ? 
  the european administration wants trump to fuck off . 
  interesting angle . 
  i did n't think about the connection between the paint cans and a museum full of art . 
  ** the dup will never agree to an irish language act , its leader has said . 
  ** arlene foster said that perhaps there should be a polish language act instead because more people in northern ireland spoke polish than irish . 
  alluding to sinn f\u00e9in demands , she told a party event : `` if you feed a crocodile it will keep coming back for more . '', 
  mrs foster said she was not prepared to `` reward bad behaviour , and to capitulate to manufactured demands '' . 
  ** ` see you later , alligator ' ** graffiti in belfast calling for an irish language act the introduction of an irish language act is a key demand of sinn f\u00e9in going into the assembly election . 
  any act would guarantee irish was given the same official status as english . 
  that would lead to measures like : 1 . the option for irish to be used in court 2 . irish being used in all assembly debates 3 . the widespread use of irish by all state bodies , including the police 4 . the appointment of an irish language commissioner to ensure use of the language is facilitated asked for a response to mrs foster 's `` feed the crocodile '' remark , sinn f\u00e9in leader gerry adams replied : `` see you later , alligator '' . 
  ** ` rewriting the past ' ** the former first minister said the 2 march election was `` about republicans trying to re-write the past . 
  `` even this past week we have seen the attempts to put our soldiers and our police officers in the dock while those who maimed and murdered over the past fifty years walk free . 
  `` let me be clear , so long as i am the leader of the largest political party in northern ireland , that is not going to be allowed to happen '' . 
  ** mrs foster says michelle o'neill will be ` instructed ' by gerry adams ** she said michelle o'neill , sinn f\u00e9in 's new northern leader , had been `` hand-picked by gerry adams to do his bidding in northern ireland '' . 
  on the subject of the botched renewable heat incentive ( rhi ) scheme , which may cost ni taxpayers as much as # 490m , the dup leader said it was `` not the cause , but it did become the excuse for this election '' . 
  `` i know that the investigation into the rhi scheme will clear my name , '' she said . 
  mrs foster was enterprise minister when the scheme was set up in 2012 ; it was intended to increase the creation of heat from renewable sources . 
  however , businesses have been receiving more in subsidies than they are paying for renewable fuel and the scheme became highly oversubscribed . 
  well , i 'm actually a real life psychic . 
  i can really speak to your dead relatives and i can also actually tell the future .
