  why i did n't become a stockbroker and live in a shitty council house with a cluttered reading room is a personal choice . 
  i 'd feel bad about using my real gifts to make money . 
  except more certain . 
  and then an abrupt finish . 
  no upward inflection . 
  canadians speak like how i imagine labrador retrievers would articulate themselves . 
  i guess they 're canadian too . 
  other canadian woofs , like the newfoundlander , i imagine to articulate themselves more like snuffleupacus . 
  i forgot why i 'm here . 
  he 's jealous he ca n't pronounce it correctly . 
  i say that too . 
  ar\u00edst is more affirmative . 
  polish . 
  you 're almost polishing . 
  just need to bash more on the zs and ws . 
  it 's yo-weeeee !, 
  it 's also the shortest month , kinda cut short a few days . 
  if you 're cutting your firewood in february , i think there may be a miscalculation somewhere . 
  it means cut or shortened here too ... hence why it can mean something that was castrated too . 
  literally the exact same meaning . 
  book of dun cow is exaclty the gaelic script people learned to write irish in until 1958 . 
  it 's not miles off latin script , probably just became stylised that way and that was the way people who spoke irish wrote . 
  [ irish script ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?q=gaelic+writing+system&amp;client=tablet-android-samsung&amp;source=lnms&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewii_akb6vnrahukosakhqtnd-yq_auibygb&amp;biw=962&amp;bih=601#imgrc=1vpay5ff8sprjm: ) [ traditional v. modern ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?q=gaelic+writing+system&amp;client=tablet-android-samsung&amp;source=lnms&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewii_akb6vnrahukosakhqtnd-yq_auibygb&amp;biw=962&amp;bih=601#imgrc=r8x2rlwlwwy2bm: ) here 's an example in handwriting on june 14th 1988 [ gaeilge scr\u00edofa ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?ie=utf-8&amp;client=tablet-android-samsung&amp;source=android-browser&amp;q=handwriting+irish+script&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=yjcxwoimi-jogaat6r34dw#gws_rd=cr&amp;imgrc=uarpshomzvfnnm: ) i guess it was still being taught like that in the seventies ... [ handwriting guide ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?ie=utf-8&amp;client=tablet-android-samsung&amp;source=android-browser&amp;q=handwriting+irish+script&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=yjcxwoimi-jogaat6r34dw#gws_rd=cr&amp;imgdii=vgshks5uexkhom:&amp;imgrc=uarpshomzvfnnm: ) when was g\u00e0idhlig standardised then ? 
  it looks awfully like my grandparents ' irish to me . 
  it was a joke . 
  it should be . 
  uk wants friends . 
  he 's feeling a bit lonely and left out . 
  as it should be . 
  if you learn gaeilge you 'll understand g\u00e0idhlig , or at the very least be able to read it . 
  it corresponds to scots g\u00e0idhlig except the spelling and topography were simplified in 1958 , so a lot of the silent consonants were removed . 
  until 1958 everyone wrote irish in [ gaelic script ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?ie=utf-8&amp;client=tablet-android-samsung&amp;source=android-browser&amp;q=gaelic+script&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=6g-xwlvacajhgab39a2gba#gws_rd=cr&amp;imgrc=-iztz95nozdpnm: ) but they changed it for typewriters or something like that . 
  ( the dots on top of the letters are ` h 's ) so , if you read modern scots g\u00e0idhlig , it 's like the old spelling of irish in latin letters with the accents going in the opposite direction . 
  they 're both what 's linguistically known as q celtic and are very , very similar . 
  i think manx is q celtic too . 
  they 're also related to what are known as the p celtic languages , which are welsh and brittanic and i think cornish , which are a bit further away and not intelligible to q celtic speakers . 
  it is an indo european language , but a little earlier , so the grammar is quite unique . 
  as for vocabulary , it has loads of latin and french influences from the church and the normans and words of scandinavian etymology from the vikings . 
  and of course , words of english origin that are just spelled and pronounced a bit differently . . like hata for hat . 
  so words like room , seomra , comes from french and sounds like chambre . 
  s\u00e9ipe\u00e1l , the word for church , sounds like chapelle ... or a cathedral is eaglais . . \u00c9glise . 
  yeah , it 's not as bizarre as it looks but the grammar is fairly unique , i guess . 
  i knew a dutch guy who learned it easily and perfectly and his accent was great cos the dutch accent kinda suits a conamara accent . 
  yeah , it 's a perfectly phonetical spelling system for the language . 
  it does make sense , it just seems complicated if you 're not a native/fluent speaker/reader . 
  irish was pretty much the same as g\u00e0idhlig spelling until 1958 ... except irish script was used ... they just simplified the dhl out to make gaeilge instead , for example . 
  and the accents go the other way . 
  soo ... more vowels , less silent consonants , is d\u00f3cha . 
  i kinda suspect he might just be a mentally ill loner . 
  you get knives in shops . 
  he might be embarrassed that he actually has no terrorist buddies . 
  it 's hugh . 
  so does ` an gearran ' in scots gaelic . 
  it can also refer to something that has been castrated . 
  . in irish gaelic , anyway . 
  everyone knows the difference between romanians and gypsies . 
  i would n't worry if i were you . 
  i agree . 
   there was no celtic invasion , just a spread of culture . 
  okay maybe i 'm mistaken but i believe i read that all the ` celtic ' markers that match the basque region are generally thought to be cro magnon . 
  . . and the west coast of western norway . 
  things like o - blood and red hair and stuff are their leftovers . 
  also , there was no celtic invasion , just a spread of culture . 
  the dna they define as celtic is just cro magnon dna , the first wave of people who came over . 
  that population and dna was never replaced in peripheral regions , wales , ireland , scotland amd i belieev its also the dna that is similar to the iberian dna that matches , so the pictish and celtic dna was just a mythical , relatively modern invention that never really happened . 
  no exceptions in germany until after 12 weeks . 
  germany has tighter abortion restrictions than alabama ? 
  is that due to second trimester abortions ? 
  what does the text message say ? 
  yeah . 
  same in ireland . 
  you ca n't buy alcohol after 10 pm in shops . 
  stupid law ... it 's only around 10 years old . 
  yeah !, 
  that 's just bad economy . 
  they 're just gon na sit in the fridge and rot . 
  not as funny as the dutch one ... and such a knock off . 
  it was . 
  it 's pretty expensive though and people over 40 generally have a good wage . 
  most people just leave for jobs , particularly the younger people . 
  it 's also far more balanced than the uk in terms of wage equality and on average people are wealthier than there . 
  i 'd say it 's pretty accurate , the problem is finding the jobs . 
  most people emigrate rather than be unemployed . 
  ... into doom . 
  she sure is . 
  class divide is not a remnant of imperialism . 
  okay . 
  only six have been created since 1965 , great . 
  is that an achievement ? 
  parliament is in the hands of those born into the privileged elite . 
  how they must empathise with the plight of those struggling and working . 
  i 'm not saying eu is perfect at all ... all i am saying is the arguments used by brexiters against the eu are the very wrong ones . 
  brexiters are playing into the hands of the elite who will benefit the most out of it . 
  the rest of the population will not do well . 
  yes , just look at how class divided it is and how the elite are still in power . 
  there is even a hereditary system of peerage in parliament still , the house for lords . 
  it even still has a two tier educational system with vastly different standards of education and opportunities . 
  the eu is a blame game for many , with no accountability from successive governments . 
  the sub continent , yes . 
  they were invited over by the british government .
