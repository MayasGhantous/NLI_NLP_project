  eu did n't even exist then . 
  the blame lies with the british governments . 
  and yet they 're not accountable . 
  the eu gets blamed for every single problem , most of which actually originated from british governments , many more of which are remnants of the empire . 
  it 's funny really but your description probably is an accurate evaluation , although i would replace racists with an under educated population of xenophobes . 
  the muslim immigrants that brexiters hate so much do not have their origins in the eu . 
  they were invited to the uk as guest workers after ww2 from commonwealth countries ... bangladesh and india mainly . 
  most of them are n't even immigrants . 
  many are third or fourth generation british born , so statistically they do n't count , even though they are the main bulk of the visitor islamic ghettoisation in areas such as east london or bradford . 
  eu gets blamed for all the shitty decisions every british government has ever made . 
  in fact the previous labour government gets blamed for all the shitty decisions the current tories have made . 
  it 's funny really how little brexiters even know about the reality of their own government ... they just buy the blame game they 're spinning . 
  so , the banks are not planning their exits currently ? 
  i heard differently . 
  i guess that 's the eu 's fault too . 
  that is truly an understatement . 
  ergo , dup are the supporters of anti abortion regulation in the north . 
  thanks for clearing that up for yourself . 
  in government , is it not ? 
  i fucking hope it is . 
  i 'd love if it bit that fucker in the ass . 
  karma , bitch . 
  good old scotland . 
  i think sturgeon is fanfuckingtastic . 
  she does so much to stand up for the interest of scots . 
  we also appreciate what you did with the uni fees . 
  bollox catholicism stranglehold on the irish constitution . 
  just bollox . 
  in the north , funnily enough , it 's the unionists who are absolutely anti abortion . 
  they 're like 16th century puritans . 
  also bollox . 
  she was expecting medical after care for her daughter from her gp and presumably expecting doctor/patient confidentiality . 
  some woman had to get an abortion in england cos her baby had microcephaly and had to be compensated under un human rights [ violation ] ( https://www.rte.ie/news/2016/1130/835621-united-nations-abortion-amanda-mellet/ ) but still ... no fucking abortion . 
  it 's bollox . 
  for fuck 's sake . 
  are we doing equines now ? 
  oh , goodie ... [ i think shetlands are probably icelandics closest relatives , they 're sorta donkeyish too and also strong as fuck !,

  i wonder if that law dates back about a thousand years . 
  they 're fuzzy . 
  for the cold . 
  he 's not wrong ... 
  remember that era of charismatic dictators ? 
  anyone ? 
  lyons tea ? 
  you fucking heathen . 
  cats are bastards . 
  it 's actually the story of why they 're so pure bred and sturdy . 
  over 1000 years of selective breeding but no active immunity . 
  and they do n't startle because they have no predators , hence not giving a shit about an active volcano in the background . 
  i love them and i love their story . 
  they all look like goofy [ fabios ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?ie=utf-8&amp;client=tablet-android-samsung&amp;source=android-browser&amp;q=fabio&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=nc2pworxa-jygaafgbzydg#gws_rd=cr&amp;imgrc=x8laureuc8c-nm%3a ), 
  i love icelandic horses . 
  there 's something so hilarious about seeing 6 ' 4 '' men riding pony sized horses with their ankles hanging below barrel . 
  sturdy little fluffsters . 
  [ they 're so cute .

  in fact , the statement itself gives credence to the turkish soldiers ' potential allegations . 
   farther of prince harry . 
  sure , his farther . 
  definitely not his biological father though .

  i need eyebleach . 
  horses are better than cows and there are tonnes and tonnes of breeds native to all over europe . 
  can we do horses and ponies instead ? 
  baby formula ... then introduce mashed veg etc , then soft solids like mashed potatoes , scrambled eggs , yogurts . 
  then kid versions of what the adults are eating . 
  probably more german born of kurdish ancestry . 
  just saying , when uk finishes their strop they 're only going to have the us . 
  it 's gon na be great . 
  i also said potentially russia . 
  and to answer your last question , us is aligning with russia . 
  uk is aligning with us . 
  when you do n't understand what everyone else is talking about , you 're better off not joining in . 
  do n't know what 's going on in the world ? 
  that 's cool , just talk brexit to brexiters . 
  my original statement was that brexit and trump have created unity within their own opposition . 
  you said that was not true because there is more support for brexit in britain since the referendum . 
  i clarified that was not what i was referring to . 
  i 'm not your butler bitch , figure out your own answers . 
  well , may was happy to be seen licking trump 's balls and being submissive to the us . 
  as if that is a strong negotiating stance for the uk and as if they will benefit from getting a trade deal when they 've literally told all their closest trading populations to fuck off and beg a megalomaniac for any possible crumbs . 
  uk and us look like stupid idiots because they are . 
  it 's not a joining , it 's a `` let them off and let us be careful and work together sensibly ! '', 
  so , brexit and trump have done a good job of getting everyone to see the sense of diplomacy and working together , thus fostering unity and strength within their own opposition . 
  do you understand now ? 
  or are you still looking at it from an isolated , insular position ? 
  forgetting one main perpetrator . 
  the one who has been known for premeditated football hooliganism for decades . 
  i do n't think the eu is annoyed by it at all . 
  that 's the angle the uk are trying to take . 
  uk is trying to claim they 're being bullied . 
  how ? 
  they 're leaving a member organisation , fine . 
  but you ca n't take the member perks with you . 
  everyone else is the return of the world . 
  licking trump 's balls is not looked upon as an act of pride or dignity . 
  there were two main countries . 
  no prizes for guessing . 
  the english do n't want to be more like the irish .
