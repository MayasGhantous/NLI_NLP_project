is this stat for ukraine excluding the occupied crimea and eastern areas or including them ? 
  speaking of fish and being in a desert , i was amazed at the quality of alaskan king crab at the bellagio in vegas , i have no idea how they get it all the way from alaska into the middle of a desert lol and keep it fresh !, 
  now that i think of it , loaf of bread in the us is unhealthily full of preservatives , forgot about a loaf in the boot of the car on a trip for a few weeks , only to find its was still soft after frying in the boot all that time . 
  the thread seems to be about supermarket food , but the competition among restaurants means the quality available on menu across the us is very good overall . 
  and you get all sorts of oddities beside milk and bread that doesnt go off , i was surprised to find californian oranges in the middle of orange country in florida , how does that make sense when down the road can buy fruit by the wheelbarrow from local growers . 
  speaking of local growers i loved buying fresh fruit from roadside stalls from california to georgia , damn making my mouth water . 
  ive been to most states as well as countries here in europe as far as the caspian so have experience comparing . 
  i am from ireland , i found the food in us very good !, 
  no scratch that very very good . 
  but yes it was hard to find fruit/veg in some locations in texas on a trip once but then again , its the middle of fracking desert lol , so no surprises there . 
  one thing i could never get over is the `` nuked '' milk in us , the expiry dates were like months into the future , how the hell that happen !, 
  oh noes , we know what happens to countries where russian speakers are `` prosecuted '' better watch your back latvia, 
  brexit was won by a margin of 1.5 % does that also make it invalid by your reasoning ? 
  do you usually rephrase what other people post ? 
  actually technically speaking what we see is how a republic works , trump won because the us republic has elections shaped in a certain manner . 
  he did not actually win the democratic majority vote , at time of this post 60,839,497 votes for hillary 60,265,847 votes for trump if the us was a true democracy and not a republic then hillary would have won anyways i replied elsewhere on this thread `` best case scenario trump endsup being fairly relaxed guy ( which is hard to image based on his behavior up to now ) worst case scenario is a global recession or worse ... '' so needless to say no wonder people are worried . 
  shared by millions here in europe as well as a majority in us ( do n't forget that hillary actually has more votes than trump ) . 
  best case scenario trump endsup being fairly relaxed guy ( which is hard to image based on his behavior up to now ) worst case scenario is a global recession or worse ... 
   i have to say , many european leaders as well as the eu bureaucracy have displayed a contemptible behavior towards the u.s. election process . 
  how would you `` behave '' if a `` third way '' fascist/populist persona was growing like a cancer in your friends body ? 
  what are you some sort of expert ? 
   is this a way to counter china in africa ? 
  its afrika , 
   tonight i 'm glad i live in europe today i 'm glad i live on the west coast of the most western european country :( because one day soon you wake up to find trump has pulled the us out of nato and putin is oiling his guns on the eastern front ... 
   give them airplane tickets to go to ireland . 
  from article  they say they are entitled , under the eu dublin iii regulations of 2013 , to be transferred to germany to join their family members who have secured international protection . 
  they claim they are unlawfully prevented doing so because of the eu-turkey deal . 
  if they do not want to come here , then that is fine by me . 
  what an annoying autoplaying ad on mobile . 
  btw let em go to germany, 
   maybe something else is at play , like a disability or no time through looking after children maybe tho that raises the question of can those things not be done outside of london, 
  to be honest calling the british system a `` democracy '' is stretching the definition , tho `` dear leader nigel '' on a cover of daily mirror has a ring to it ? 
  :o lets see : * no constitution to protect citizens from the state * hereditary monarch as head of state * un-elected lords in the upper house who are appointed by a monarch and/or born into it * elected members of parliament who suspiciously come from same upper class schools , suspiciously * first past the post elections ... * government who are wanting to kill human rights legislation ... aside : ** but of course ** its the eu that is undemocratic eh ? 
  so the only people who are actually elected by normal people ( in a far from perfect system of representative democracy ) are now told should not have the right to vote and/or debate on the most important decision to affect the uk in half a century or more, 
  someone somewhere should apply for eu funding to do a thesis on `` big data '' analysis of the size of russian online trolling ` intervention ' in europe . 
  to gather `` proofs '' of what is so blatantly obvious nowadays . 
  what language are they using out of interest ? 
  or just bad google translate translations from russian ? 
  well i see ireland got dragged out into the middle of the ocean and fattened up on fish and chips too . 
   what the hell is going on ? 
  putin is laughing his head off while pulling these alt right puppets strings, 
   someone is going to interpret that as a literal call to arms . 
  these editors need to be reined in before ukip/bnp/edl members start arming themselves . 
  yeh we would n't want anyone else [ getting shot and/or stabbed ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/16/labour-mp-jo-cox-shot-in-west-yorkshire ), 
  if one can not find paid employment in london after a couple of years one has to wonder how hard that person ( s ) is looking for a job ... 
   british reject all immigrants except anglosphere irish need not apply ... 
   usa on their own have more than enough firepower for the russians . 
  anything the rest of europe has is just a bonus . 
  usa/nato yearly military budget alone is larger than russian gdp by now, 
  let 's not tip toe around it , russia has become a neo nationalist/fascist state . 
  and before someone tries to deflect with a standard operating `` whataboutism '' type of reply , no while many things are fucked up in the west we still have a long way to go in order to become a shithole like russia . 
  hopefully we never fall down the same slippery slope . 
   how about this ( crazy idea ) : you use excess power to pump up a lot of water to an elevated space .

  only took 4 comments for a `` whataboutism '' type comment to be posted , this must be a new record, 
   are n't we all . 
  not much phases me when it comes to cuts and privatisations but i swear to god , the level of apathy when it comes to what 's happening to the nhs it makes my blood boil . 
  how do you feel about private companies such as nissan having to be compensated due to brexit in order to maintain the same level of profits instead of that money going to nhs, 
   ireland will probably suffer more than the uk . 
  [ nowhere near as much as uk ] ( https://m.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56g8h1/who_would_be_hurt_the_most_in_a_ukeu27_tradewar/ ), 
  the whole brexit vote was based on a `` us vs them '' mentality , that was the core of the whole matter the rest of us in europe were going about our business only to wake up one day and find that we are no longer welcome in uk because we are `` foreigners '' , some even got physically assaulted , and to add insult to injury we have uk ministers openly talking about using europeans living/working in uk as `` pawns in negotiations '' and coming up with idiotic ideas such as having companies make lists of `` foreigners '' working for them ( despite hmrc already having this data ), 
  you are new here so , there were/are plenty of posts here from brexiteers along the lines of `` europe cant afford not to give us a good deal because of x , y , z '' and `` if they dont give us a deal we can start a trade war '' my thread above deal with facts , and the fact is uk would be the most affected either in a total or partial tit for tat trade war ( by a wide margin ) , then ireland , then benelux , then nordics . 
  btw downvoting me for actually dealing in facts and figures just because reality does not match your world view is fucking asine, 
   this is the bottom line here . 
  we have very little to gain , almost everything to loose and no bargaining position . 
  [ yep ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56g8h1/who_would_be_hurt_the_most_in_a_ukeu27_tradewar/ ), 
  * flood ukraine and syria with weapons , stand back and watch russia overstretch themselves again . 
  it worked in afghanistan in 80s . 
  there is only so many corpses they can hide before the average russian starts asking `` why are our boys fighting and dying in syria and ukraine '' * develop and deploy anti ballistic missiles , and upgrade existing nuclear and conventional stock making it very clear to putin that any further westward `` expansion '' into eu or nato will be met with overwhelming force . 
  * make it a criminal offence to receive funds from russia or from a company affiliated with russia if you are a political party or a media company . 
  random checks of funding sources should make fringe parties think twice before accepting kremlin 's money . 
  * ban sale of any technology and machinery to russia older than 20 years . 
  * expand sanctions against more russian `` elites '' * threaten to cut them off from swift unless this constant saber rattling stops . 
  bullies only understand overwhelming power , appeasement wont work , it didnt work in 30s it wont work now against an authoritarian who is closely following a path that europe already traveled . 
  it is a win win for nissan 1 . 
  if they lose money due to brexit and the government does not help them , then they can close up shop and blame it all on theresa may causing a scandal potentially toppling the government . 
  if theresa may does somehow compensate them ( assuming that doesnt breach antidumping provisions present in trade treaties ) then they are no worse off . 
  notice also how this is about safeguarding existing jobs , unlikely any new jobs would be created ... 
  it should be interesting who else will now crawl out of woodwork looking for the uk taxpayer to foot `` guarantees '' the irony of money that could be going towards nhs going to a `` foreign '' car maker , priceless !!, 
  for everything else there is a hard brexit :d, 
  they are welcome to come to ireland 1 . 
  polish is already 2nd most spoken language here before english and ahead of irish 2 . 
  our currency does n't lose 20 % of its value it short space of time 3 . 
  people are overall friendlier 4 . 
  the % of people born outside of ireland living/working here is double the % in uk , we welcome more people who want to work here and pay our taxes  5 . 
  we know firsthand what it feels like to be looked down upon by the brits, 
   this is what the ukrainians used to think . 
  that and if they were not prepared then the people would blame them if ( when ?! ), 
  it happens here in ireland they sent out radiation tablets at one stage back 10 years ago or so , just in case ... 
   the same can be said from eastern european countries ; in this sub for instance , people are real afraid of russia and for them the russians are coming , so is perfectly reasonable the military build up by nato in those countries ... they supposedly fell more safe , with all those weapons and troops around them . 
  except it is not in their imagination ussr ** did ** occupy these countries under a brutal regime for more than half a century , while they watched their counterparts in the west get ever more prosperous and more free and fulfilling lives . 
  it happened it is not unfortunately a figment of anyone 's imagination . 
  to this day eastern europe has daily reminders of this occupation . 
  russia ** did ** invade and occupy provinces belonging to its neighbour ** s ** in very recent history .
