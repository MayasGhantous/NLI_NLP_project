  islamic extremism 3 . 
  russian neo-fascist ambitions throwing europe into yet another world war 4 . 
  criminals trying to reignite the ira all of that despite geographically being fast from russia and not yet a target for islamists like our neighbors . 
  well the very same russians are busy fueling the flames of brexit via shady funds ( i wonder how much boris was paid ... ) let that sink in for a minute if anyone from the uk is reading ... 
  which makes me wonder if there is grounds there for an anti competitive lawsuit then, 
   the map is useless anyways because crimea is not colored red ? 
  or because you think half of europe should be colored red like the old days ?? 
  btw did you see the top thread today about the video of people trying to escape ddr ? 
  so is his prosecution ( execution ? ), 
  of opposition politicians and journalists :(, 
  i have another word to describe your politicians with whom you seem so happy about corrupt . 
  but hey when you lie with dogs you get fleas . 
  [ realistic or opportunistic ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10795042/gerhard-schroeders-birthday-party-with-vladimir-putin.html ) ? 
  seems to me like [ your politicians are willing to loosen sanctions ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/opinion/germany-looks-to-ease-russian-sanctions/ ) and put a blind eye on russian transgressions so they can [ build more pipelines ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-02-18/germany-s-planned-nord-stream-2-gas-pipeline-to-russia-must-go ) and create nice job opportunities with russians after a life in politics, 
  if they are a criminal and have been convicted of a crime should they not actually be going into a prison ? 
  seems like deporting them would be the easy way out for the criminal ... 
  germany and its people have learned his lesson the hard way , the problem is that no such `` enlightenment '' occurred in russia which brings as back to the topic at hand , nato responding to a perceived ( and after what happened in last few years ) and quite likely real threat that putin 's authoritarian regime represents . 
  and as a german i am sure you would agree that events in modern russia has many parallels with germany in 1930s . 
  how would have things turned out back then if more countries were more prepared and did not have a policy of `` appeasement '', 
  damn seems like the rural areas are very nice !, 
  except russia would and does charge large tariffs , have they not recently doubled prices for polish truck drivers ? 
  if it walks like duck , quacks like a duck , waves dick like a duck , it must certainly be a duck . 
  those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it . 
  except this this time there is this thing called nuclear weapons :(, 
  which the russians can equally do right now with their missiles along the border and in kallingrad . 
  the parallels between the rise of nazism and modern fascist russia are many , in hindsight it would be irresponsible for other countries not to prepare seeing how putin is copying everything out of the fascist playbook, 
  you are not thinking like putin he could wake up one morning and take a gamble ( or feel he has no choice as he has dug himself into a hole ) and invade the baltics this could prompt nato to collapse as some nato members such as germany do not want to do anything and might have conflicts of interest if having to respond to russia , we seen already how weak and uneven sanctions over crimea are , basically a slap on the wrist for what amounts to an anschluss style anexation not seen since ww2 he might be emboldened by his past successes and actually start to believe his own propaganda ... 
  rural ireland is the complete opposite , there are houses dotted everywhere and people living in them . 
  there are alot of small time farms everywhere and not much of the larger scale agriculture ( and hence huge fields ) that is in english countryside . 
  un peacekeepers could be brought in and end the war , it was done before , and yes ireland was involved many times in helping bring peace . 
  but russia continues to veto every single attempt at un level to bring peace . 
  it 's almost as if they want a war there to distract their population from domestic issues such as failing economy and rampant corruption . 
  nothing like a good old war to bring out nationalistic fervour . 
  go ahead then , list em . 
  yet you have a spastic fit over polish , of whom we have more of in ireland btw and it 's been a plus for us all edit : * living in uk there but not born there : 7.7 % outside the eu + 3.6 % from other eu states * living in ireland but not born there : 17.3 % 17.3 % is a larger proportion of the population than 11.3 %, 
  a gas that will lead to more flooding and sea level rise , suck to live on an island then ... 
  anyone who actually watched the video find all of this highly disturbing ? 
   they 'd sell the whole world to make a profit . 
  but but those pesky regulations ... 
   comparing catholic/protestant irishmen in the us to muslims from mena in the eu is a gross oversimplification . 
  yeh we do n't tend to spontaneously combust ... 
   i am very supportive eu and i do recognise that it has plenty of flaws . 
  such as ? 
  this is much bandied around but no concrete examples ever given , starting to think its a pile of hot air . 
  vote with your wallets and holiday elsewhere other than turkey . 
   anyone else thinks this is unprofessional ? 
  evil is the word you are looking for in what russia is doing at un in preventing any attempt at international resolution of this war . 
  that 's beside directly killing civilians via their military . 
  but hey lets have a fake outrage, 
  we have more polish people ( with 12 smaller population ) than all of uk according to latest census . 
  17 % of population was not born here . 
  and get on quite well . 
  unlike the racists across the little pond, 
  well at end of the day we are not the ones throwing a hissy fit about `` bloody dirty europeans migrants '' , if anything our governments plan is to get as many young taxpayers working here . 
  hell i still do not understand why they hate the polish so much , migration from poland have been a positive for ireland imho, 
  why do i have feeling ireland is on the list only to appease uks xenophobia we were one of the few countries to accept people from new eu states without any limitations, 
  the uk is not client but a full member , your analogy is terrible . 
  if you have a 24 month contract with sky sports and you break it 2 months in , you are breaking a contract and could be dragged into court . 
   they worked for the eu , not the uk . 
  of which they uk was ( still is ) a member . 
  if you are a member of club and you all decide to hire a lapdancer with a nigel farage face on it , you are all expected to pay for ms farages services into her retirement . 
   notice how the headline , and the article , assumes that you do n't know anything at all about the baltic countries to be fair how many americans can actually point out on maps where estonia , lithuania and latvia are on maps ? 
  i still remember the number of times during my extensive travel thru ; us trying to explain where ireland is ( eeeeeiiirlannd as some said ), 
   that number is debatable . 
  some of it is for a bailout of ireland jic nice try, 
  2,000,000,000 / 350,000,000 = 5.71 weeks of extra nhs funding, 
   maybe we can change the colour every decade ... 
  things could get awkward once scotland leaves uk, 
  if only we used bendy bananas when shafting the uk ... 
  well some russians do seem to believe everything is a conspiracy , and russian propaganda actively encourages cynicism and spreads fud like your post . 
  btw i was born in soviet union so know first hand how things operate ( and how some things have n't changed , like corruption and brainwashing ), 
  go to the article and click on link titled `` anyone can see them -- they are all on our website '' , here let me recreate it [ anyone can see them -- they are all on our website . 
  ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1230 ) -------------- aside : speaking of transparency , did you guys figure out yet [ how medvedev an co managed to siphon off so many billions in corruption proceeds for his palaces , yachts and vineyards ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrwlk7_gf9g ), 
  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019/malmstrom/blog/transparency-ttip_en  sharing information with the national governments of the member states , with members of the european parliament and with members of national parliaments is key to ensuring democratic scrutiny of the negotiations and informed debate based on facts . 
   the commission has always ** made all ttip documents available to the national governments of the member states ** and will continue to do so . 
  ** members of the european parliament also have full access to the eu 's proposals and positions ** . 
  furthermore , ** we have published virtually all the eu 's negotiating positions and textual proposals ** . 
  this is key because these texts will end up as a part of the final agreement . 
  ** anyone can see them -- they are all on our website ** . 
  we have ** also published summaries and explanations about our objectives in the negotiations in clear , non-legal language in all eu official languages ** . 
  when your world view is shaped by daily mail ... 
  bank of mattress ... 
  i said starting , good luck getting an apartment or house in any of the cities where these jobs are . 
  once hit 33k he would lose 50-52 cent on each extra euro . 
  gazillion hidden taxes and charges, 
  so # 349,999,957.08 ** remaining ** for this week, 
  how long are the old ones valid for ? 
  no quite the opposite the propaganda machine went full retard in seeding doubt , confusion and misdirection, 
  there is a difference between russians ( people ) , russia ( country ) and putin ( dicktator ) putinbots try to make all of the above the same , fortunately we can see thru reality distortion bullshit, 
  if you have another european language beside english there is no lack of support jobs which pay 20-30k starting , cost of living is very high here tho , so are taxes, 
  i 've nothing against turkish people , same as with russian people ( hell i was born in ussr ) i do have an issue with authoritarian dictators , who have no problems with staging false flag attacks and/or taking advantage of terrible events to grab more power for themselves . 
  elsewhere in this thread i recommended that the flag of st petersburg is used instead of the russian flag since all nationalistic symbols have been hijacked by putin for his agenda ( same agenda btw which so royally fucked up turkish tourism industry let me remind you ) . 
  putinbots are already making use of this tragic event to spin the `` see the evil west doesnt like us '' . 
  oh and please stop painting yourselves as a victim , you have one last chance left of preventing a dictatorship arising ( against the wishes of your secular state founder let me remind you ) in a few weeks . 
  how will you vote ? 
  https://gov.spb.ru/en/official-symbols-stpetersburg/ would show support for the normal people of st petersburg but not putin 's warmonger policies . 
  you know what would be great for helping fight islamic terrorism ? 
  not buying their stolen oil ... 
  the more options the better , the less money we send to putin to wage on war against his neighbours and suppression of his peasants .
