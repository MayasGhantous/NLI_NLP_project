  i am surprised he has n't used the opportunity to blame baltic national for the bombing and hence create a reason to invade , groundwork is already being laid with various claims being made in last months, 
  funny how in a 100 years russia come full circle and now once again has [ tsars with palaces , vineyards and yachts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrwlk7_gf9g ) while the peasants remain piss poor with sub-saharan life expectancy and an added heroin/aids problems, 
  so all the spanish have to do is play `` macho macho men '' over loudspeakers and watch the british stiff upper lip tremble ? 
  while they at it can we has 6 counties back please , pretty please . 
  well it is exposing the uk government for the blubbering fools they are , if i were a ceo looking to setup shop i think hard about doing business in uk ... 
  if only they could live easily in another european country ... 
  article is behind paywall so above link is for cached page . 
  in the current `` negotiation '' the eu have put oil in fire by mentioning gibraltar , they can really throw the oil can into the inferno by giving scotland some sort of fast track guarantee ... 
  i still remember 15 + or so years when most of what you see in that picture was an industrial wasteland . 
  any visitors to ireland should realize there are 3 irelands , north , dublin and the rest ( and the sun dont shine much in any of em :( ), 
  lol 4 of the coins in the picture are old irish punts , 
  erm what ? 
   registrant contact information : name : direccion sistemas organization : telesur address : calle vargas boleita norte edificio telesur city : caracas state / province : miranda postal code : 1050 country : ve phone : +058.2126000202 well that explains it, 
  putin must be rofling, 
  i see some of that much promised 350 million a week should go towards basic education ( especially now that eu funds wont go towards supporting much neglected region called wales ) 3.3 million is not 10x of 1.2 million, 
   post-brexit plan to spend # 500m so the promised 350 million a week to nhs will be diverted for one and a half weeks , no problems ... 
  second time this week actually , she already put a question mark over security cooperation with europe , a week after a terrorist attack outside westminster . 
  while the brexit referendum was a shovelful of manure , may somehow managed to continue dig a deeper and deeper hole for herself and uk as whole . 
   ** well , that escalated quickly ** . 
  she went from saying she wants to be good friends and neighbours to wanting war . 
  and that my friend is why europe needs eu, 
   considering it was 300 years ago , i think any possible claims are well past their expiry date . 
  someone tell this to putin and co, 
   so now you have thousands of spaniards who work in gibraltar losing their jobs , so now you have hundreds of thousands of british pensioners returning to uk . 
  what will that do to the nhs eh ? 
  tho ' i suppose with an extra 350 million a week there should n't be a problem ... 
  in exchange for an island/peninsula somewhere sunny , i hear gibraltar is up for sale soon by its owners . 
  the brexiteers invented a fake story narrative so each time the question of scottish independence comes up they can say `` but but spain will not allow it because x '' this puts a silver nail thru that `` argument '' . 
  they also resurrected `` but but scotland cant pay for itself '' angle , which was ironically enough used 100 years ago when ireland was seeking home rule . 
  they point at a 9 % deficit and say `` eu would not let them in '' while ignoring that : 1 . 
  uk itself had 10 % deficit few short years ago 2 . 
  all this illustrates is that current scottish politicians are adept at milking uk to benefit their people . 
   now it has 3 of them . 
  scotland hasnt left yet , should be 4, 
  staring trump too !, 
  yes the one day out 364 that the sun comes out ... 
  australia has immense resources and is close to china and india and japan who are buying said resources , fueling a massive property bubble, 
  oh god i setup a plant in lets say bulgaria and pay ~ $ 1.36 euro ( current minimum wage there ) an hour for a widget to be manufactured . 
  i sell it in uk for 10 gbp ( $ 11.73 euro ) you have a factory in uk which makes a similar widget but due to current uk minimum wage you have to pay # 7.50 ( $ 8.80 ) . 
  needless to say you are going to go out of business . 
  and now your employees can not move elsewhere in eu and work they are imprisoned in uk on benefits . 
  one of the arguments of brexiteers was that cheap eu workers were rendering british employees on the unskilled end unemployed . 
  with free trade not only will they become unemployed they cant now work elsewhere in eu . 
  and their widget plant will need to obide by eu regulations if they do lower their minimum wage 6x ( or the pound crashes 6x ), 
  they are not completely different , they are interrelated and my example illustrates why and how they are related . 
  having free trade but not having freedom of movements screws over the average person in uk . 
  with free trade and not being able to work in eu , the eu producers can undercut the british ones , import into uk and not have to hire and uk citizens who are now basically imprisoned without and opportunity to work easily in eu . 
   no need one can also encode you encrypted message into kitty cat image ( added bonus if video is used ) then share it on reddit . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/steganography granted you wouldnt be able to transfer much encoded data , then again there is no lack of cat pictures on the internet and its not like whatsup is a high bandwidth communication channel . 
  you dont get it . 
  if there is free trade between the uk and eu27 , but there is no freedom of movement . 
  then europeans would be able to start businesses ( hiring whoever they want from eu ) and import their products into uk . 
  the whole brexit campaign was build around the lies that those `` dirty/cheap europeans '' are coming in and taking jobs , with free trade and no movement uk citizens become unemployed ( and without opportunity to work in eu ) while being flooded by imports made by those `` dirty/cheap europeans '' . 
  to add insult to injury you would no longer have a say in our laws and regulations either . 
  you know coming from a country where 101 % of the population votes for putin time and time again its a bit rich of you to be quoting any statistics . 
   if we 're trading with the eu , then those businesses who are exporting to them ( less than half our exports , which are n't by any means our entire economy ) have to follow eu rules . 
  everyone else does n't . 
  when you 're in the eu , everyone has to follow them . 
  there is a bit more to it than that . 
  imagine the headlines if there is free trade between uk and eu and the dailymail and torygraph realize that canny irish people are setting up factories along the border and employing ( gaaassssp ! ), 
  eu citizens ( oh the horror / s ! ), 
  or just transship belarus style between the two economies i can see it now `` dey took our jobs !, 
  tarrifs now !! '', 
  so in this scenario them dirty / s europeans are still `` costing the uk jobs '' and now you have no say in our laws . 
  well done , congrats . 
  how is this for a doze of reality , if tariff free trade remains between eu and uk ( great ) then i would be able to setup a factory right on the border with uk , employ anyone i want ( gaaasp !, 
  even those bloody eu foreigners / sarcarsm ) and provided i follow the law of the land here i be able to export to uk tariff free . 
  as added bonus the daily mail and telegraph will scream murder once they realize that `` those canny irish and poles , dem took our jobs ! '', 
  providing loads of free advertising to the business/factory . 
  so roll on the brexit :d, 
  i am shocked to see a joke originating in germany, 
  looking at your username , we should for a team mate , 
   i crashed with my bike into a pole on a saturday at 3am was either of you fellow europeans drunk ? 
  i think that was the plan by islamist 's all along , make muslim countries poor again ( and hence susceptible to bullshit ) unfortunately they won , i would not want to travel to any muslim majority country with my wife and kids out of fear for our safety , even tho we are atheists/agnostics in this household . 
  # 350 million a week would but a lot of chocolate for everyone in uk . 
  uhm something is missing , i cant put my finger on it, 
  so next time there is an attack in uk ( and there will be more ) who will newspapers blame ? 
  * whatsup for not caving on encryption backdoors ? 
  * eu for not sharing information with them ? 
   it 'd take a special type of cunt to not warn another eu country on an attack if we had the intelligence . 
  it may take a special type ? 
  jokes aside . 
  its fascinating watching this idiot who you called a c word demolish security cooperation and goodwill which will make it easier for terrorists to attack in europe ** and uk ** ... a week after a terrorist attack outside westminster itself ... 
  depends on how far in the snout goes in , i suppose ... 
  all the spies are running the us, 
   we 'll only be a ferry ride away , come around for a pint sometimes . 
  and an anal exam by border patrol ? 
  west , there is a knack to it you need to order things `` fulfilled by amazon '' aka in their warehouses , [ and spend about 25gbp per order or more , see `` deliveries to the republic of ireland '' section ] ( https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeid=1204872 ) , once you get to checkout chose slowest delivery and then its free most of time , comes with an post my last order for 105gbp had no delivery charge, 
   look up colossus ww2 bad example since the british decided to destroy their computers after the war, 
  they also have only two languages ( which amazon.com now comes in ) . 
  in europe we have a whole zoo of languages ... and currencies ... 
  its going to be a big problem here in ireland since we get send to amazon.co.uk and endup having to use pounds . 
  tho ' delivery is usually free, 
  the country that still has a sense of humo ~ ~ u ~ ~ r ... 
  you voted for a russian puppet ? 
  well done , murica !, 
  anyways pass this invoice to your leader ------------------ invoice # 1 ------------------ to : mr trump ------------------ for : us military use of european soil for their bases and thousands of dead europeans helping with the war on terror .
