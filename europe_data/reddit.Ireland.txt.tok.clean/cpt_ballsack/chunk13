  but but whatabout russian corruption ? 
  spring is coming , its time for the annual tank migration to the ukraine, 
  you are trying hard to stretch over backwards with your but but the us whataboutism deflection, 
   they held up their side of the deal they have not when it comes to ukraine, 
  good kebab genes ? 
  i do n't know what 's more disturbing * you are serious ( and presumably not like 7 years old ) * your sentence structure is so similar to trump 's i always wanted to visit turkey , now i 'm not sure if i want step foot in a local kebab house ... 
  well they are not being offered a referendum, 
  how 's that 350 million a week river flowing, 
  that sounds like those films `` the bus/ship that can never stop '', 
   in 2015 scotland exported # 49.8 bn to the ruk and only # 12.3 bn to the rest of the eu 49 % of uk exports are to eu27 , if may thinks that the uk can survive such a restructuring then scotland will be quite fine, 
  do remind us how many british territories are real tax havens , literally most of the worlds real tax haven are while here in ireland the double irish arrangement was killed off years ago , and yet companies keep coming , and now that uk is leaving eu it will only accelerate, 
  50 of those were the brits dragging their feet not wanting to grant proper independence , hell the island is still not free of them . 
  you missed my point , we left the empire and doing better than uk without any natural resources , scotland will be quite fine . 
  if scotland remains in eu and is independent then they will be able to pull quite a lot of business from the south, 
  you do realise that this is the very same argument the empire used against home rule here in ireland ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/government_of_ireland_act_1914  the financial situation was a concern . 
  irish taxes had yielded a surplus of # 2 million in 1893 , that had turned into a current spending net deficit of # 1.5 m by 1910 that had to be raised by london . 
  an annual `` transferred sum '' mechanism was proposed to maintain spending in ireland as it was [ look where we are now ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.pp.cd?locations=ie-gb ) and thats without oil !, 
  [ scotland will be fine outside the uk and within the eu ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.pp.cd?locations=ie-gb ) hell those sheep herders even have oil unlike us cow herders , 
  well if scotland leaves you can spend that money on the nhs just like that 350 million a week boost you got from brexit oh wait ... 
  my argument is that polling can be wrong and that in this case we ** actually have real votes ** from a year ago from brexit referendum by scottish ( not just polling ) indicating a support for it . 
  to deny the people of scotland a vote is : 1 . 
  undemocratic 2 . 
  hypocritical in light of brexit, 
  i agree but * last time uk wasnt leaving the eu , something that scottish people support as per brexit voting results ( not polling but actual votes ) * every argument made for brexit can be made for sexit * and beside independence from westminster there is now an option to continue to be a eu member . 
  so not only brexit like ( independence ) arguments can be made but also economic arguments ( uk being led into unknown by tories , scotland being ignored by london etc ), 
   as of now , no , although the ** polling ** of voting intentions is basically the same or slightly better for yes than last time have we not learned anything from brexit and trump about polls ? 
  more importantly every argument made for brexit can and will be reused for sexit . 
  even if they lose this referendum ( no sexit ) then the tories endup looking like absolute hypocrites when it comes to brexit itself , if tories try to drag their feet or not give a referendum then thats also a win for snp . 
  its a win win for snp , they either get their sexit or they make tories look like the incompetent hypocritical gobshites that they are . 
  well well tories have dug themselves into a corner , every argument made for brexit applies to scotland 's sexit ... she mentioned the hypocrisy of england wanting to trade with whole world freely ( except for scotland if they leave ) she also has a good point in regards to northern ireland and an open border with ireland . 
  finally brexiter 's sniggered on about the eu falling apart `` like dominoes '' if the uk leaves ( if anything it had opposite effect ) and now it seems the uk itself will have to `` change '' , churchill and thatcher must be spinning in their graves if they knew what the tories have become and done to the uk ... 
  interesting repercussions for ireland and ni rejoining too ... 
  speaking of forecasts where is that 350 million a week to the nhs ? 
  we irish have brexited ( well mostly , people from ni should take note , scotts for that matter too ... ) the uk during the last century . 
  and are a proud member of the eu , making the most of it instead of cribbing and moaning about it , people here rightfully blame our politicians for most problems ( no lack of them , in fact very same problems as uk faces such as housing , health , education , corruption etc ) instead of blaming the eu for everything . 
  hell the percentage of the population living/working here that was not born in this country is double what it is in uk !, 
  we also use the euro here is how we are doing ( compared to the uk ) * http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.pp.cd?locations=ie-gb * http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.cd?locations=ie-gb the problem is not the eu , or the euro , or migrants/expats but your system of government which is populated and run by elites , who masterfully use the media to deflect attention from their continued mismanagement of the uk, 
  eu did n't force austerity on uk , conservatives did . 
  hell you guys are not even in euro . 
  but do go on ... 
  a doctor tells you that you will die once you ingest some cyanide you decide to injest cyanide ( referendum ) but have not yet written a suicide note ( a50 notice ) , you proceed to claim that the doctor is wrong since you are not sick , ignoring that you have not yet taken the pill . 
  those damned experts / s, 
   well it seemed like a straw man at the time but since then there has been talk of a eu military , a two speed europe where the core binds together to become more unified the rest can join when they want . 
  talk of borders being protected . 
  i 'd say these are the signs of a superstate forming . 
  this vote was n't looking at the next decade it was looking at the next century and the path seems to be federalism . 
  i see , the problem as illustrated in your post is lack of basic understanding about the eu and a unhealthy diet of british press . 
  lisbon treaty for which your parliament voted on ( the same parliament you expect to bring you into a glorious future btw ) the same lisbon treaty we in ireland had two referendums on ( no lack of democracy here unlike the uk with its unelected lords , a queen and mps who come from same elite schools ) ensuring that it gets modified to allow countries to opt out and more importantly giving countries ( specifically ireland ) certain guarantees . 
  which is how the eu worked for a long time , for example : * uk had optout of the euro * uk & ireland had optout of schengen ireland gets an optout of any eu military since we like being neutral , btw seeing that uk is already in a military alliance with these countries ( hello nato ) and has no issues bombing people half a world away ( remind us how many million of yee protested against iraq only to be ignored ? 
  once again reminding you that uk is not a proper democracy ) its a bit rich to be complaining about military cooperation . 
  have you noticed a pattern yet ? 
  the feeling of powerlessness and being ruled by `` elites '' is not due to the eu but is how the uk political system works . 
  to add insult to injury any protections from these elites that eu granted you will now be done away with , so enjoy your surveillance state where you do not have human rights . 
  the british press has masterfully tapped into the current of discontent that average person has about the uk political system being a sham ( first past the post is prime example , scotland and ni being neglected is another ) and redirected this anger at the eu . 
  probably the only institution that kept your elites in check . 
  the same elites who can not wait to privatize the nhs and do away with protections that workers enjoy and regulations which ensure high standards of goods/services . 
   i 'd say the main reason english ( british ) people voted for brexit was that we did n't want to become part of the eu superstate what superstate ? 
  they voted based on a giant strawman argument . 
  well done . 
  may claims that `` no deal would be better than a bad deal '' this report claims `` no deal is the worst possible option '' now the question is do you believe ( gaaasp / s ) experts ( uk treasury ) or do you believe a flip flopping opportunistic politician ( may ) ? 
   but it 's no secret that wesminster is ignoring most places outside the south east . 
  can you paint that on a bus and drive it around scotland and northern ireland, 
  reporting for duty, 
  russia is not as strong as it believes it is or more cynically they want to be surrounded by failed states so the russia population does not get any ideas by comparing themselves to their neighbours . 
  putin has already launched several wars of conquests . 
  ask georgia and ukraine as to how those are getting on . 
  as for trump he is already banging on the war drums . 
   why are germans so obsessed with trump ? 
  because they know first hand as to what happens when a right wing authoritarian with same rhetoric and methods gets into power . 
  an authoritarian who has sympathies ( is in cohort ? ), 
  for fascist dictator from an another expansionary + nationalist state . 
  you try to make a sarcastic joke but these people will be rehoused into new blocks somewhere on outskirts of moscow while very expensive appartment towers will be built in their place and the pockets of putin and his mafia will be lined further . 
  edit : [ as described further down ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5vph08/moscow_to_demolish_8000_sovietera_housing_blocks/de3vxf3/ ), 
  dear nigel pitty there is not an international organization you are hell bent on leaving which is doing its best to replace fossil fuels with renewables , set emissions and efficiency `` regulations '' , funds research into solving the issues and provides a forum for countries to have a dialogue with each other . 
  pitty ... 
  and it still remains poor , btw westminster will now have to find money to pay all those areas that got eu funding , fun fun fun, 
   putting in place a currency union in an area where there are very different economies operating at different efficiencies without sufficient fiscal transfers , pooled debt or political institutions with oversight , causing imbalances in unit labour costs to build up , causing vastly different levels of unemployment and out of control sovereign debt in some states . 
  so london vs north of england ... 
  median age ireland : 36.4 years . 
  could be a language barrier thing  and i read the whole thing wrong , but anyways my point about putin stands , europe can not afford yet another `` strongman '' going on a rampage . 
  crimea was annexed , 4 other regions are almost there and not just ukraine i am talking about here . 
  annexation of a part of european state and continued war is something we havent seen since 30s , all using same tactics of propaganda and disinformation while stroking similar hate/nationalism/resurgence themes under a `` strong leader '' . 
  now the same `` leader '' is using information warfare and funds to influence democratic process in other countries , including yours . 
  if you do not see a problem with that , well then i am sorry for you . 
   more like sanction russia over something that has had no actual impact on french society . 
  annexation of austria and czechoslovakia by an authoritarian fascist had no direct impact on france until it did ... 
  it seems particularly relevant as we see shades of this all the time on this subreddit ( not just limited to russia , points at what has happened in uk and us in 2016 and so far this year ) and seeing how several major european countries will have elections this year . 
  i get to regularly to see the reality distortion field in action ( since my elderly parents religiously watch russian language satellite broadcasts ) , its downright scary . 
  good genes ? 
  one day people will look back and wonder why we destroyed so many beautiful landscapes with windmills, 
   only a matter of time till northern ireland reunifies with us . 
  i would rather they become their own country thank you very much, 
   who gets to be the number 1 sheep shagger ? 
  the welsh or zealanders ? 
  america first, 
  are you still here ? 
   did n't ireland leave some form of union a while back ? 
  scotland should take note , we dont have oil either . 
  the problem might not lie in europe ( ireland done quite well out of eu ) but in westminster ...
