  fascists advocate a mixed economy , with the principal goal of achieving autarky through protectionist and interventionist economic policies check i would say trump is about 80 % there in how he fits into the official definition , tho ' who needs facts when you have alt facts right ? 
  waves from the irish bridge !, 
  our bridges are the best bridges , huge . 
  good genes . 
  this tall !, 
  built with large hands . 
  look your argument is based on your stereotypical preconception that ireland is a religious country . 
  ireland is not a religious country , people often baptize their kids not because they believe in god but because it means getting into a better school , and unfortunately a lot of the schools are still run by religious orders ( tho ' the secular educate together schools are even more popular and have to turn kids down due to lack of spaces ) you are welcome to visit and see for yourself . 
  if anything i was quite shocked how much more religious were southern states in us and for that matter some provinces in germany are on my travels . 
  correlation is not causation, 
   again was u/cpt _ ballsack who made the claim with high fertility . 
  he is from ireland . 
  his claim . 
  blame him . 
  you people make me sick . 
  read the whole thread if you wan na talk . 
  the high fertility has little to do with `` religiosity '' , ireland of today is not ireland of 20 years ago where you comment might have had a little bit of merit . 
  but dont let your preconceptions stop you . 
   its what usa/uk is doing now for decades ... congrats , didnt take long for a ` useful idiot ' to appear with a standard whataboutism comment . 
   this conflict has no long-standing diplomatic solution . 
  that is exactly what putin wants you to believe , mission accomplished . 
  btw the whole notion of an `` homebrew insurgency '' armed with advanced tanks , missile launchers , antiaircraft guns and so on is ludicrous , here in ireland we had an `` insurgency '' in the north for decades , i do not remember the ira `` somehow '' acquiring tanks and advanced weaponry . 
  there is no way in hell russia is not involved in this fucking mess they created . 
   well , we 'll see whether ambassador haley gets fired . 
  i would n't joke about it , enemies of putin have a tendency to endup poisoned with radioactive tea , or shoot themselves in back of head , or fall down stairs , or get heart attacks ... 
   that 's because many american companies relocated there to avoid taxes and they artificially boosted the gdp [ loophole was closed 2 years ago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_irish_arrangement ) , still companies moving here , with brexit we will become the only english speaking country in eu ( sorry malta ) [ btw ] ( http://languageknowledge.eu/languages/english )  although ireland is n't really that rich define rich ? 
  yes the healthcare and education and transport system have issues ( which country does n't ? ), 
  and are underfunded , yes taxes are insane ( 50 % + above $ 33k in income , high vat , + dozens of hidden taxes ) but home ownership is one of the highest in europe , fertility is one of the highest ( people want to have children here ) , 3rd level education is ( mostly ) free . 
  generous welfare system . 
   it 's more on the uk 's level hahahahaha , london would be `` richer '' yes , but the rest of uk ? 
   still suffering high unemployment [ down to 7.1 % and falling ] ( https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2017/0131/848924-unemployment-rate-falls-to-7-1-in-january/ ) not far from the lowest figure of ~ 5 % achieved 10 years ago  huge emigration rate you are several years too late with your analysis , [ quite a lot are returning in last few years ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/abroad/generation-emigration/emigration-of-irish-nationals-falls-13-with-35-300-leaving-in-year-1.2329252 ), 
  and kettle 's, 
   ** only ** 60000 jobs ? 
  can we get ** only ** 10000 extra jobs in ireland ? 
  pretty please what do we have to do ? 
  bake a red blue and white cake in a shape of a dismembered uk and send it to her majesty ? 
   it was later claimed he died of a heart attack . 
  dear kgb ( whatever you call yourselves nowadays ) how mundane ?!, 
  rare radiocative element in tea , multiple self inflicted gunshots to back of own head , now these are interesting but here they fallen back to the old calling card methods . 
  well the whole organic movement is a load of bullshit ( ha ! ), 
  short of you the consumer being able to drop in unannounced onto the farm and see for yourself , god knows what could be done to your food . 
   trump shot corporate america in the foot trump hates it giants such as facebook and google , so . . 
  until the next economic crisis , last time the `` wealth fund '' piggybank was raided was a few years ago , they also took several % points for several years out of every private pension pot ( and then they wonder why people dont bother with pensions anymore ), 
   may 's gov will propose to build a wall around uk which eu will pay for . 
  dont joke , [ brexiters already want ireland ( and eu ) to pay for welsh roads ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38153180 ), 
  you were n't around there when ussr collapsed like i was , it can get alot worse, 
  they already blame the west for everything , give them 60 years like last time to wake up . 
   a nice big tube between ireland and france will be welcome . 
  not by gchq , it will mean spending public money to tap into it . 
   if economists make predictions based on wrong assumptions then those predictions are pointless and we were right to ignore them . 
  thats retarded ( trend with brexiters ) i can make a prediction we all die in a nuclear exchange , but my prediction is foiled if trump doesnt trigger the button, 
  predictions were based on cameron claiming a50 be triggered immediately, 
   but but usa did n't take long for a whataboutism comment to appear, 
  they also have biggest natural walls , absolutely huge , just ask sean hannity, 
   nope . 
  the eu has n't been close to that level of uk exports for some time . 
  its hovering around 40 % and falling . 
  and when we leave the eu and make trade deals with the row it will drop even more and probably at an even quicker rate . 
  ** nope ** [ its about 47-48 % for 2016 as per your own her majesties revenue and customs stats published on 11th of january 2017 ] ( https://www.uktradeinfo.com/statistics/overseastradestatistics/pages/ots.aspx ) but hey who needs fact when your have ** alternate facts ** eh ? 
  http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/irl/gbr/show/2014/ my point is that most our ( irish ) exports to uk are actually physical products such as food and medicine that they need , yes they could get these elsewhere but would it be of the same high quality ? 
  ( take for example red meat ) i am not saying that ireland would not be hurt , see my linked thread above . 
  in a total tradewar they would lose 49 % of their exports , we would lose 15 % , next eu country in line is 9 % all the way down to 1 % ( average for any eu27 economy is 5 % of exports going to uk ) that is a 10x difference right there , loosing 1 to 15 % of exports would push many countries into a recession , loosing half of exports would kill the uk economy . 
  especially considering their main exports are services which can easily move ( such as banking ) . 
  let me make an analogy . 
  in a total trade war with complete breakdown of trade between uk and eu27 would be analogous to uk chopping of one of their arms at the shoulder , while 27 other states would loose anything from their hand ( ireland ) to their fingertips . 
  now no one wants to loose any limbs that much is obvious . 
  but at the end of the day it is uk that is the one standing in the center of the room swinging a machete like a crazy maniac while the rest look on in bewilderment !, 
  [ actually it wouldnt ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56g8h1/who_would_be_hurt_the_most_in_a_ukeu27_tradewar/ ) while yes 15 % of our exports go to uk ( 49 % of uk exports goto eu27 btw ) most of these exports are actually food , i doubt the british want to starve or eat low quality food from god knows where . 
  and even if we were to loose all our exports to uk , while it would hurt it would not be anywhere near the impact the the crisis of 10 years ago had on our economy ( from which the country is only now emerging ) . 
  so yes complete cessation of trade will be bad for ireland but nowhere near as bad as it would be for uk . 
  are we forgetting that the city is already basically a tax heaven ( one that is very good at appearing to be anything but ) and half of the worlds offshore tax-heavens are british territories ? 
  ireland is in the eu and will remain so , uk will not be ... ** anyways the double irish was actually closed ** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/double_irish_arrangement, 
   german business leaders tell you that the british market may be important . 
  but it is only one market , compared to 27 markets in the rest of the eu . 
  this 27x uk is important but if bending over for britain ( at our expense ) leads to eu falling apart then better cut of the rot early before it spreads, 
  because some people like to take advantages of opportunities for employment , education , hell falling in love with someone that freedom of travel offers . 
  instead of moaning and cribbing about it , wanking over a long dead corpse of an empire . 
  i have friends who moved to london to start their careers and now moving back to build a house , start a family etc. 
  btw some of my extended family are british and never bothered getting irish passports despite being here for decades , thats even more common here . 
  i will need to visit after wikipedeaing the town !, 
  i suppose people would be doing the same when my little town gets the role in 2020 , 
  a population that takes advantages of eu membership instead of moaning about it while remaining obsessed with a victorian class structure and dreams of a long dead empire , imagine that / s, 
   you do n't understand do you enlighten us please does brexit stand for red blue and white coloured brexit ? 
  or does brexit means brexit ? 
  i have news for you , if everyone is screwing your economy its yourselves , not like the 450 odd million people across eu woke up one day and said `` lets fuck uk up '' . 
  what do you want ? 
  a tarrif free trade with eu27 ?? 
  so what do we get in return ? 
  what about those pesky laws and regulations that your exporters will continue to have to abide by ( and no longer have a say in ) ? 
  way to dig yourself in a fucking hole . 
  but yeh continue to play the victim after stabbing yourself and everyone around you . 
  [ btw if there is tradewar uk will be screwed the most 49 % exports ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56g8h1/who_would_be_hurt_the_most_in_a_ukeu27_tradewar/ ) followed by ireland ( 14 % of our exports ) whose main export is food to feed your population , the rest of eu has minimal exposure to uk market via exports . 
  why not ? 
  is n't setting up a tax heaven exactly what may threatening to do ? 
  ireland left the glorious union and how has a higher per capita standard of living than uk . 
  and thats before everyone in uk lost 15 % of their wealth in 2016 due to falling pound . 
  something for much ignored regions of the uk to think about ... 
   australian phds got refused residency or the right to bring their spouse and kids to the uk , but a romanian or slovakian could have no problems whatsoever . 
  are romanians or slovakians somehow lesser than australians ? 
  seems beside and obsession with class the uk still also has an obsession about race too,
