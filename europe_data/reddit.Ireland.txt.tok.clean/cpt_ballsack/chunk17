  whats this wonderful country you speak of ? 
  here they have realized they more complex they make tax code , the better their ( revenue employees and their contractors such as accenture ) long term employment prospects are, 
  hardcore socialism ... who says it ever made sense ... 
  i mean not like the uk has bigger issues to worry about such as brexit , speaking of which those high paying bankers might have to relocate soon enough anyways so that solves that `` issue '' i suppose, 
   do you know what happens with drug dealers in russia ? 
  it depends on whose palms that dealer greased ... 
   being in the single market was very useful . 
  ** still ** being in the single market ~ ~ was ~ ~ ** still is ** very useful . 
  they have n't left yet and wont be for at least 2 years and some more ( at the minimum ) , or they might never leave and just continue in perpetuity with this circus ... 
   the real difficulty arises when it comes to borders at sea , it is harder to control them and if someone has to be rescued our coast guards have no choice but to bring them to europe . 
  they would have a choice if we had agreement with northern african states to bring them there , but they obviously also do n't want these people . 
  i agree with you , but why the hell are our navies/coast guards patrolling so close to african waters lately ? 
  constant news of x migrants rescued within dozens of miles from africa . 
  i mean the smugglers dont even need to try hard , access to europe is floating right there on the horizon . 
  there were plenty of alliances before ww2 , in fact that 's why britain and the us eventually got pulled in the war . 
  as for nato , what happens if putin decides to test nato `` unity '' , there are already grumblings from other nato members about having to support some `` ex soviet states '' and then there is trump who sees no need for nato apparently and who is being controlled by putin . 
  crimea was `` anschussed '' one could say , the two choice on referendum were the same , which is even more brazen than what happened in austria . 
   he is playing a very dangerous game not only is he playing a dangerous game he is doing it in almost identical fashion in to how the previous gobshite nearly destroyed this continent, 
   not a fan of desert chique in europe they will stand out instead of being camouflaged . 
  need some sort of green woodland pattern or one of those minecraft ones . 
  the problem is other european nations might not want to go to war over some small `` former soviet state '' ignoring their treaty obligations . 
  european history does contain examples of countries being thrown under the tank threads of a an expansionist fascist dictator in previous century . 
  look how that ended up . 
   i agree , everytime i see one of those '' the baltics are literally shitting their pants in fear of russia '' articles on here , i audibly cringe a little . 
  speaking of ~ ~ putin ~ ~ ( russian president valeri volodin ) and baltics the latest jack ryan book is on the subject of invasion of lithuania and how it may proceed  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25194147-commander-in-chief the last book by tom clancy before he died was about invasion of ukraine , before it happened . 
  while they are fiction the authors do strike at the core of various concerns in these countries . 
  well they did ask for it by killing ragnar / spoilers, 
   march 31st what year ? 
  is the question ... 
  ok if ~ ~ ze germans ~ ~ putin were to roll into scotland , wales and northern ireland tomorrow what would you expect your leader to do ? 
  waffle waffle whataboutism , deflection blah blah going back to your original post . 
  if trump were to invade lets say kallingrad , murmansk oblasts and primorsky krai tomorrow , what would you expect your dear leader to do ? 
  when it quacks like a duck , walks like a duck , talks like a duck it must be a duck, 
  please do not drag our smaller ball of an island along with your bigger ball of an island , 
  right speaking of biased , [ make sure you get paid on time this time ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11656043/my-life-as-a-pro-putin-propagandist-in-russias-secret-troll-factory.html ) i hear life is getting tougher in russia under putin , so its important you get paid on time mate, 
  the uk cock is still fully lodged in the eu cockfest . 
  once the uk cock is out in the middle of the ocean on its own ... 
  not putin 's madness no ? 
  so when russia rolls into 3 of your provinces what do you recommend a leader should do ? 
  nothing ?? 
  edit : to the putinbots downvoting me if trump were to invade lets say kallingrad , murmansk oblasts and ~ ~ vladivostok ~ ~ primorsky krai tomorrow , what would you expect your dear leader to do ? 
  right thought so ... 
   `` every dissatisfaction must grow into a resentment . 
  every resentment must become an argument . 
  every argument must grow into a fight . '', 
  wow that 's some yoda level philosophy/thinking right there !, 
  spot on btw , the rest of the world is being `` trolled '' by russia for a lack of better word . 
  aha thanks !, 
  this ^ as someone who lived thru the collapse of ussr and what followed , things can definitely get much worse, 
  i submitted this first ( 4 hours before this ) https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5lyfwf/paris_could_lure_20000_bankers_from_london/ but my identical submission got down-voted by brexiteers i suppose it depends on time of day eh ? 
  mods ? 
  how do you say `` one does not bite the hand that feeds '' in french ? 
  username checks out, 
   why ? 
  [ this is why ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.cd?end=2015&amp;locations=us-ru-cn-in-ie-de-pl-gb&amp;start=1990 ) 1990 to 2015 ( no data for 2016 yet ) timerange in 1990 chinas gdp per person was 10x smaller than russia 's in turn russia gdp per person was 7x smaller than us now they are the same if not higher ( no data for 2016 yet ), 
  http://www.timetemperature.com/time-zone-maps/large-world-time-zone-map.shtml the countries in the cartoon do not experience new years at the same time , 
   did somebody drag our wee island out to the americas again !? 
  with our wee-er island attached to yours, 
   irish person here . 
  i 'm afraid we are shit when it comes to learning other languages including our own ... 
  do remind us as to what happens to dictators in mena who fall out of favor with the us, 
  it would be highly ironic would n't it , if turkey gets a better deal than uk, 
   so you 're saying that borders should remain static until the end of time ? 
  if the people of crimea want to be part of russia , then its their right to try to achieve that goal . 
  so chechnya , how did that endup ? 
   next year , putin will invite obama to his wedding !, 
  ha a red wedding !, 
  shame i ca n't say that eu membership and the us has done the same for the uk . 
  well you can blame the eu all you want , at the end of the day it was uk politicians who instead of taking leadership position in europe decided to follow that yes minister sketch . 
  but hey the same `` elites '' coming from same `` elite '' schools and unelected peers will be the ones to take britain into the glorious future in the middle of the atlantic, 
  no it should n't . 
  we are doing quite fine being where we are . 
  we dont have a say , the brits are the one who held a referendum , nothing we can do about it but react to best of our advantage . 
  and are on average now richer than people in uk thanks to eu membership and connections to us, 
  they must be putting something in the water across the little pond . 
  it 's like some sort of mass psychosis happening in uk this year . 
  it wont be forced on anyone , government on both sides will rush to put in checkpoints ( plenty already exist ) to prevent criminals taking advantage of price gradients in either direction ( you think we have a problem with fuel laundering and people shopping in north and vice versa as currencies swing , you seen nothing yet ) . 
  no one wants a border impeding movement of people ( tho i can see uk government imposing checks so those bloody eu migrants dont come in and take their jobs in reaction to provocative articles in daily mail ) , but movement of goods and services is a whole different story . 
  what happens if uk signs a deal with russia lets say and overnight cheap vodka and cigarettes floods the south ? 
  revenue and customs would have an absolute fit . 
  or the other way around what if eu makes a deal with some banana republic and overnight the uk is flooded with bent bananas ( god forbid ) ? 
  can you imagine headlines in uk papers of free trade between ireland and uk remains as it is now , if lets say some enterprising border entrepreneur sets up a factory or farm and employs people from eastern europe ( gasp the horror !, 
  / s ) and then sells his/her goods/services in the uk unobstructed hence taking local jobs !, 
   if they put up a border i think ireland should leave the eu . 
  eh no stop talking bullocks . 
  soon on rt : russian olympic official found dead in his flat 's staircase after stabbing himself multiple times in multiple locations with a uranium tipped umbrella ... ... while having a heart attack . 
  nono shes a `` bloody foreigner '' ( definitely not expat that word only applies to rich brits in spain ) that came to the promised island and ` took our jobs ' and then diluted our gene pool / s, 
  lived thru 80s and survived the collapse of 90s of ussr ( yes i am a gray beard now i suppose ) most impactful memory was having to queue up ** as a small child ** for hours every day ( mother had to work ) for bread . 
  i remember shops for years having empty shelves . 
  i remember having to use tokens/vouchers . 
  i remember after queuing up for 3 hours one day reaching the top of the queue to be told by the clerk that the price of bread is double the amount of roubles it was the day before . 
  i remember not knowing what fresh milk or meat was until 93 i think it was . 
  another memory was the school plastered in red slogans and posters , and having to wear that silly uniform . 
  and having a room explaining what to do in case of nuclear , biological or chemical attack , i remember having a gasmask at home for some reason . 
  having to disassemble an ak in short time . 
  wiping arse with pravda because whats toilet paper ? 
  yet another memory is hearing gunshots at night constantly , rolling brownouts and blackouts . 
  cold winters as communal heating pipes leaked . 
  tho ' there was bright spots of fun , in hindsight climbing barefoot as a child during summer holidays thru what people would describe now as post apocalyptic trainyards and abandoned industrial factories/warehouses/cranes . 
  fishing in water that had a layer of oil on top .
