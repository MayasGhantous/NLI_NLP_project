  collecting olives for my mum and so on . 
  oh i vividly remember the tv suddenly being flooded with ads for anything from marlboro ( everyone smoked ) to snickers in glorious black and white . 
  fuck in hindsight i should write a book !, 
  its a surprise i turned out to be normal !, 
  so my opinion ? 
  ** i survived !, 
  no the greatest tragedy was keeping up to 250 million people on 1/6th of the worlds land surface caged up ( while murdering them by the millions ) under a suffocating ( politically , economically , culturally , scientifically ) regime for 70 + years . 
  [ i was one of them :( ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5kf8h0/eastern_europeans_post_your_honest_opinion_about/dbocemr/ ) . 
  my great grandparents barely survived the famine created by the soviets before ww2 . 
  [ my grandparent fought in ww2 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5kd7n5/russia_engaged_in_battle_for_its_own_history/dbn6j0p/ ) . 
  the collapse of the ussr was an opportunity missed by russia to become a normal country that takes care of its citizens , that boat has now sailed and normal oppressive programming schedule has resumed . 
  from what i remember as a child those were simply never mentioned/airbrushed out of history we were taught in school ww2 started on 22nd june 1941 and ended with fall of berlin on 8th of may 1945 . 
  there was also a constant barrage of ww2 films on tv all time . 
  like i said it was quite interesting learning about finland , poland , baltics , the whole pacific campaign , north african tank wars and so on . 
  also now that i think of it absolutely no mention of the lend lease from us , but a constant focus on how factories were moved beyond urals and the heroic factory workers . 
  i regret not being able to save to this days the extensive library of russian books we had :(, 
  from soviet/russian point of view ww2 ( great patriotic war ) went on from 1941 to 1945 . 
  it was a great surprise to me as a child to learn that there was so much more history to it . 
  in the context of my post putin is trying to hijack the memory of the war for his gain , he obviously cant take claim for the whole war ( tho ' if anything 2016 has shown us , is that truth and facts dont matter ), 
  su was a terrible place to live , but everyone knew the system was fecked up and only paid lip service to `` communism '' or `` socialism '' or whatever they in kremlin wanted to call the whole fucked up system that year . 
  news of how much freeer and prosperous the `` west '' filtered thru ' the borders and made everyone wonder why do they have to live in such a bleak system . 
  now its much scarier . 
  capitalism and democracy was absorbed , hijacked and bastardised in a weird mix of neo-tsarism , neo-nationalism and neo-fascism with putin and dozen or so of his kgb buddies running the show , they even managed to absorb ( are part of ? ), 
  the mafia . 
  people now blame the west for all their problems , they no longer want ( or can ) realise that they are back in the same suffocating jail but under a new name . 
  bah its just maddening seeing a country and people of so much wealth and potential being screwed all over again , except this time they are taking up the rear and saying thank you . 
  my grandparent fought in ww2 and got medal for assaulting and capturing german pows somewhere between gdansk and present day kalingrad . 
  sometime in last few years all sorts of interesting documents about ww2 went online which is great ( he never talked about the war ) . 
  tho ' he would be spinning in his grave now if he knew how fascist like modern russia under putin has become ( my family emigrated in 90s , i lived thru 80s , the collapse of ussr and what followed for while ) putin trying to hijack the achievements and suffering of the common russian man during the velikaya otechestvennaya voyna for his nationalistic rhetoric and political gain is perverse . 
  in politics you have the left <  right axis and the authoritarian <  libertarian axis perpendicular to that russia switched from being in top left quadrant ( left + authoritarian ) to being in top right quadrant ( right + authoritarian ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_compass#/media/file:political_chart.svg another way of looking at it is the inglehart chart , notice where all the richest and freest countries lie https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/inglehart_values_map.svg, 
   my problem with this is that both sides are active on social media . 
  ** you just do n't know what is real anymore . 
  ** this is exactly what putin and his reality distortion propaganda machine want . 
  seeing that you are from netherlands just think of the fud they put out when they shot down mh17 out of the sky or your more recent referendum . 
  oh please stop , [ since you love gdp figures so much here is some food for thought ] ( https://www.google.ie/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:irl:gbr:usa:rus&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=630374400000&amp;tend=1450828800000&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) how the hell does the worlds largest country with every resource in the periodic table and full of hydrocarbons , manage to still screw its people over and over so much . 
  sigh , at least in old days we knew the government and the system was fucked up and corrupt . 
  now you are taking it up the rear and saying thank you , well done . 
  well it didnt take long for a `` whataboutism '' comment to popup , carry on ... 
  i did couple of years back , moscovites are as miserable and rude as ever . 
  my grandparents little village by the volga is even poorer than i remember , downright medieval the way of living ... 
   yes how can russia with its ballet and rich cultural history compare to the glorious nation of ireland ? 
  russia will always be a rich , ancient and great nation with an incredible history . 
  did i say anything about russia 's ( tragic ) history and culture ? 
  go fucking shill somewhere else , some of us fucking had to live thru ' the worst of it . 
  what good is ballet when average person is barely scraping by to feed their family ? 
  anyways you make yourself sound like a typical putinbot . 
  he 's robbing our great country and people lick his rear in return , incredible !, 
   sure russia does not have german gdp per capita but comparable to many eu states . 
  * russia gdp per capita [ 2015 ] - $ 11,038.82 * ireland gdp per capita [ 2015 ] - $ 56,053.73 you were saying ? 
  fecking millennials nowadays have no idea how bad life can get and used to be . 
  it is not idiotic from the point of view of putin who needs an external scapegoat to redirect publics attention towards . 
  instead of them realizing the real culprit of their troubles . 
   there are quite many western youths believing it simply because they think their own media is biased and everything coming from anti-western news ( especially russia ) is correct . 
  i grew up in 80s ussr ( and thankfully we got the hell out in 90s ) ussr and then russia were ( and remain ) terrible shitholes for the average person , the only ones who are happy are criminals and a tiny portion of the middle class that work for them . 
  they are more than welcome to queue hours to get bread as a small child , the would not comprehend not seeing meat or milk in shops for years ( wiping your arse with pravda because toilet paper is an alien concept ) . 
  they would not understand what real alcoholism is . 
  and then theres the fucking weather , fuck me there is cold and then there is russian cold . 
  these people should be given a one way ticket to russia , they can write back in a few years how they get on . 
   i think every european country should enforce a zero tolerance policy towards extremists and especially hate preachers . 
  and not just the islamic kind imho ... 
  i probably speak for quite a lot of irish ( and i am rather old ) but the whole topic of northern ireland has become a bit `` meh whatever '' if they want to join the republic thats great if they dont , nothing changes and relations are fantastic as it is hell maybe it should become a country on its own , since its a quite distinctive quadrant of the island . 
  to the average person living there the subject of brexit will be more important to their daily lives than any unification ( or lack of ), 
  russia just had a bumper grain harvest , not sure what sanctions have to do with price of alcohol , they can make plenty with grain or potatoes for next to nothing . 
  two thousand https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_mountains_in_ireland, 
  it is incredible the amount of shit putin gets away with, 
  yet oxfam has no issues asking the population for donations , the same population whose incomes rely on the multinationals directly and indirectly . 
   lighten up you old moaner . 
  say that to the homeless people on our streets this xmas why do n't you . 
  our government has more pressing issues to worry about such as homelessness than be wasting time on this . 
  or else ? 
  yes they are but there seems to be a policy of appeasement in germany towards putin since certain business interests do not want to get hurt and are busy profiting from a corrupt russia . 
  if you look on r | worldnews any day there is at least 5 independent.co.uk articles on any day , used to be 1 independent , 1-2bbc , 1guardian ,1 aljazeera ,1 cnn and so on those guys either managed to game the reddit ranking system or are paying reddit for all that traffic being sent their way . 
  this started happening a few months ago , before that rarely ever you seen them . 
  ah lol i should have had coffee this morning damn you i ** c ** eland !, 
  tricked me again :d, 
  there are barely any flats ( and/or apartments in ireland ) yet the above graph has it at 45 % did they count semidetached and terraced houses as apartments or something ? 
  do n't worry comrade if you tsar has his wishes there wont be a eu left, 
   if you do n't believe how influential map projection and chosen range could be , look at this map . 
  your map misses azerbaijan which is in europe , so going back to your point ? 
  what millions of russians died due to him ? 
  or he is actually quite sane but he got a visit from fsb pointing out that if he wants to continue getting his pension and have a longer life he better put on the white , blue and red jersey ... 
  population of russia = 143.5 million population of ukraine = 45.5 million russia annexes most of the rest of ukraine putin 's support goes to 120-130 % :0 damn :0, 
  politicians assurances means little , they can and do change their minds as the winds blow treaty/law assurances on other hand are set in stone and much harder to change . 
   do n't worry , you have majority public support for this . 
  just like there was majority public opposition ( lack of support ) to the iraq war ? 
  how did that go ? 
  yeh best of luck there , especially when your politicians make it a binary search between funding nhs or funding lets say farmers . 
  so now billions in funding will depend on whims of various governments , wonderful . 
  there is no medium to long plan where the eu spending will be matched by the government , nothing at all forcing them to continue or guaranteeing security of those funds and the parties that benefit from it . 
  come next recession they can take a knife out and gut out lets say farmers or research . 
  actually read the article , here are some gems  eu structural and investment fund projects signed before the autumn statement later this year , and horizon research funding granted before leaving the eu , will be guaranteed by the treasury after the uk leaves . 
  existing investments and grants granted will be covered until they are complete , but no new research grants once they leave ...  agricultural funding now provided by the eu will also continue until 2020 . 
  at present , farmers receive subsidies and other payments under the eu 's common agricultural policy ( cap ) . 
  they get about # 3bn a year in subsidies , with the biggest farmers pocketing cheques of # 1m . 
  the grants are given for owning land and also taking care of wildlife . 
  what happens after 2020 ? , with farmers rightly pointing out as to what will happen after wards . 
  lets put aside that this group contains many of the landowning elites the brexiters hate needless to say scottish , welsh and ni ministers have noticed that this is all short term and here are their quotes from same article  `` scotland 's finance secretary derek mackay said the announcement `` falls far short '' of what is needed , saying : `` a limited guarantee for some schemes for a few short years leaves scotland hundreds of millions of pounds short of what we would receive as members of the eu . '', 
  welsh first minister carwyn jones said : `` this guarantee only covers about half of the regional funding due to wales and does not provide the long-term certainty needed and which was promised ahead of the referendum . '', 
  and northern ireland finance minister mairtin o muilleoir said that while some applicants for eu funds will be helped , it left a `` question mark over scores of other vital projects '' . '', 
  the uk govt has made no promise to match pence for cent ( :d ) medium to long term funding that will be lost , just short term proclamations that only cover the period before next election,
