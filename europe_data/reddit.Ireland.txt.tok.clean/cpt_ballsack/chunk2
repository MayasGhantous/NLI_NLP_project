  that is not a figment of anyone 's imagination . 
  last time this happened in european history we ended up with ww2 , as dictator using the very same tactics and rhetoric , proceeded to get ever more emboldened as he realised that democracies do not want to go to war :( the fear of russia is very much justified and parallels with past european history are more than disturbing . 
  putin is a danger to his own people ( who have not learned from history , or seem to have forgotten ) and to europe which very much has learned from its history . 
  throw in photos of coal powered aircraft carrier, 
   and another 2000 in polandland ... polandland ? 
  is that like englandland but more polished ? 
  hello from irelandland :d, 
   all economic forecasts were based off of the vote . 
  actually they were based on the promise cameron made of immediately calling article 50 ( which he didnt ) the uk is ** still ** in eu right now , and has no plans of even sending notification of leaving until 2017, 
  if russia is busy in the west and pissed the whole world off , then yes this would be prime time for china to grab as much land and resources as possible . 
  debate such as `` its ok to bomb syrian children because because whatabout the us in iraq '' ? 
  never mind dogs being flown about the place using private jets lets not forget where putin and his inner circle of `` elites '' chose to send their children . 
  the evil and decadent and gay west . 
  i wonder how putin supporters square that circle ? 
  you get the same `` but but the us '' from young people in theirs 20s * who still have not realized that the world is not black and white * that communism or nationalism or fascism ( or any mixture of ) sounds great in theory but absolutely terrible in practice ( as shown time and time and time again ) once they grow up and have children then they realize that there is nothing cool about having a neonazi criminal within a few feet of a suitcase which can obliterate their life 's and their children just because he needs to be constantly told that he has a big dick . 
  however fucked up the us are , if given a choice between having their children grow up in the west versus russia guess where they would chose ... edit : for that matter guess where putin and his cronies send their own kids to ... 
  ireland has the very same problems ( housing , hospitals , schools ) plus * our population has grown much more rapidly in last 40 + years compared to uk * % of people who live here born outside of ireland is double the same figure for uk blaming `` foreigners '' for all their problems is retarded when the real cause of their issues ( like here ) are local/national politicians . 
  whole thing shows how british papers are complicit in puling the wool over the eyes of the people and redirect their anger away from those responsible . 
  one island + one quarter of another island + few dozen other smaller islands [ its complicated ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnu8xdbsn10 ), 
   well , the nato . 
  the secretary , stoltenberg , gave a press briefing . 
  you know the spanish could take a close look at the ship while its refueling and collect intelligence for nato ... an answer is needed promptly as for why this piece of junk is still afloat !, 
   does n't matter what the west is doing - russia has to be doing the opposite . 
  west is prospering , russia is economically and politically retarding again ... 
  yes we still remember yeltsin 's drunk visit  http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/30/newsid_2542000/2542983.stm, 
  shut up you gay euro piggie / s, 
   hello iran , ** your women are very cute ** , please help me get together with this iranian in my class you are not a real european man apparently :d, 
  gay married pigs ;-), 
   that 's hilarious and sad at the same time . 
  considering that every second porno on the intertubes has a russian taking it up the rear, 
  $ zone i see what they done there , uk and poland are not gay , phew, 
   this idea that any country will just be allowed to do whatever the hell they want once they 've joined is silly . 
  if that country does n't play by the rules why would the rest ? 
  you do n't seriously think that 27 countries will just `` suffer '' in silence because # 28 is being a bitch , do you ? 
  :p uk did it for over 40 years  jokes aside , ireland ( and any other eu state ) can do whatever they want ** provided their actions are not contrary to lisbon treaty ** while forming a subclub is not contrary to lisbon ( see early example about military club ) , cutting ireland off from the single market ( or even threatening it ) is against lisbon . 
  they would still have to give ireland a completely open market in terms of goods/people/services / capital  so in your hypothetical scenario the no homers club still has to give ireland ( and others ) the master key to the club . 
  needless to say such a move would only endup making the countries who join such a club less competitive , and of course there be an uproar across europe . 
  the other alternative is this subgroup of states leave the eu under article 50 ... and make their own euv2, 
  that 's fine of course they can form subblocks such as a military one ( which ireland will never be a part of because neutrality ) or shengen ( ireland not a member because uk ) that still does not `` eject '' us from eu or cut off our access to the single market . 
  they tried to put pressure via the commission ( due to competition ) over the likes of apple but the answer has been `` yeh whatever '' and whole matter has been swept under the rug now . 
  they can try to push whatever they want it wont pass the required referendum here . 
  lisbon treaty ( ironically which allows uk to exit under a50 ) barely passed due to the corporation tax issues being foreseen a decade ago . 
  hell even the recent `` hooha '' about apple has been swept under the rug already . 
  yep will require a referendum here , good luck getting it passed . 
  username checks out, 
  there are states in eu with even smaller corporate rates already ... eu access + location/connections to us + educated workforce is the key to ireland 's success , low corporation tax is an added bonus keep in mind that personal taxation here is insane , with no free healthcare to show for it . 
  somalia has a corporation tax of zero ( and no regulations ) , they are also not in eu , they are a hive of commerce tho ' i hear . 
  because the largest country in the world can never have enough clay, 
  their gdp per person grew 12x from a mid/low point russia 's only grew 2.4 x in same time hence the `` best performing '' comment, 
  yep the then russians might shut up about their need for `` buffer '' space , being all alone on an island continent in the south seas, 
  congrats economically you are one of the best if not the best performing exussr republic http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.pp.cd?end=2015&amp;locations=az&amp;start=1992 edit : downvoted for what ? 
  by whom ? 
  why ? 
  http://imgur.com/a/f9cd8 gdp per capita increases of countries bordering russia in 20 years from 1995 to 2015 : * estonia : +468 % * lithuania : +553 % * latvia : +487 % * belarus : +318 % * ukraine : +126 % * georgia : +566 % * azerbaijan : +1284 % * kazakhstan : +715 % * mongolia : +529 % * china : + 1205 % * russia : +239 % notice the outlier ( s ) : * ukraine , was corrupted by decades of russian like exploitation by oligarchs , which led to a revolution and war where it lost 2 of its most productive regions . 
  * china , enough said * azerbaijan and kazakhstan with their large oil/gas wealth did better somehow for their citizens than russia which is even more richer in hydrocarbons * belarus managed to grow too somewhat despite being russia lite , minus oil/gas * mongolia !!, 
  grew more than russia * baltic 's grew more despite being small and having no natural resources, 
  yeh where is `` proofs '' , we want to see `` proofs '' every thread about russia usually endsup derailed with the usual standard operating procedure replies of 1 . 
  where is the proof ? 
  whataboutism the west ? 
  it is interesting to see the boot on the other foot now . 
  the exporters being better off ( provided their inputs are not being imported ) is a short term phenomenon as its starting to look like that in 2-3 years these exporters will be cut off from their neighboring markets by the brexit movement . 
  ever falling pound will lead to higher interest rates ( look at russia for an extreme example ) which could push debtors over the edge . 
  are these 14 million people asking the root questions of `` why has our government not diversified the economy from primary extraction ? 
  why are our neighbors with little to no resources getting richer ?? '', 
  or are they falling for the party line of `` it 's all the west faults , they are trying to starve/invade/destroy us ... '', 
  i hear both spain and belgium require a `` government '' says vlad, 
   by that time brexiters will complain that brexit was n't complete enough reminds me of `` we have n't implemented socialism correctly '' excuses which kept being repeated in ussr for decades, 
  i am 52 % sure it is not, 
  bitcoin on other hand +5.3 % in 1 month +48 % in 6 months +58 % in 1 year +63.40 % in 2 years, 
  what a strange graph all of the values are negative %, 
  they probably made payments to characters on some watchlist banks ill not give any details if there is an investigation in progress . 
  of course each country will have its own interest , but they all signed up to lisbon treaty so any `` deal '' would have to please everyone , and any of the members could veto if they dont like some thing ( or get pissed off , for example poland is losing patience with various xenophobic remarks and attacks against its people ), 
  good , the eu needs a common energy policy and to bargain with russia as one same as we will have to deal with brexit as one to get the best possible result for all members . 
  that * and shooting down a passenger plane * bombing civilians in syria * bombing un aid convoys * continued and ever brazen disinformation campaign * supporting financially fringe/radical parties ( possibly helping brexit ) * hacking ( ties in with propaganda campaign ) putin 's russia gets away with waay too much shit edit : shouldnt take long for the typical deflection ( standard operating procedure ) responses of : 1 . 
  where is the proof ? 
  but but whataboutism usa , west etc ? 
  edit 2 : that didnt take long ... 
   iran , saudi arabia and israel ?!, 
  a cleric , an imam and a rabbi walk into a nightclub ... 
  the bartender looks at them and says `` what is this , a fucking joke ? '', 
   and russia is the competing nightclub next door , which is owned by the mafia , and has its bouncers beat the shit out of anyone who is trying to leave and go to the eu club on further thought [ a wall separating 2 neighbourhoods could be an alternate example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin_wall ), 
  i have 3 degrees ( 1 science undergrad , 1 science postgrad and 1 engineering postgrad ) all provided by me state for free ( hell i even got paid nicely + tax free for my research postgrads ) at a top university here that ranks well above any from russia in world university rankings . 
  pitty i do not have psychology degree , since you seem to have serious issues and are unable to admit that your country keeps fucking its people over and over again its quest at trying to prove it has a big dick . 
  we need a polandball style cartoon for this thread it be hilarious ... 
   i agree with the americans . 
  why is belgium a country ? 
  i hear a russian aircraft carrier is on its way in that direction , their conundrum can be easily resolved by joining the motherland . 
  yep just look at ukraine and georgia from whom they took a limb each to make an example for the rest ... 
  [ well here is my attempt at the british ruble ] ( http://imgur.com/rbskufu ), 
  yes the evil west imposed snickers , mcdonald 's and tampax on poor soviet unwashed masses . 
  let 's blame outside world instead of local criminals who ended up running the state, 
  yadda yadda yadda victim complex , whataboutism the us blah blah here from a comment elsewhere in this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/57cazh/russian_budget_proposal_for_2017_cuts_healthcare/d8rj3dj, 
  we aint doing too bad here earning 3x per person on average per year , also living for extra 10-20 years more than average russian is quite a bonus . 
  a country with 31x less people , 202x less land area , no natural resources whatsoever somehow manages to have an economy thats only 3x smaller and a standard of living and life expectancy as well as any other human development measure thats well above russia so once again ask yourself `` why is stronk russia so poor '' hint your overlords are robbing you and there is nothing you can do about it since you pissed away your freedoms in pursuit of superpower status lost many many decades ago . 
  one of the main arguments for brexit was regulation , the regulations are there to improve quality and standards of products . 
  you could endup with a `` made in britain '' burgers from a supermarket that might come from a manufacturer who once they realise they no longer have to follow stringent eu standards can cut corners . 
  ignoring for a minute the counter question of how many uk citizens would want to get their hands dirty in a minimum wage job at a mushroom processing factory . 
  and the fact that the land to grow said mushrooms might be a lot more expensive . 
  lets put all that above aside for a moment . 
  in the case of the business in the article the owners ( who i presume are also the managers if its a small company ) are irish closing a factory here and opening one in uk , creates even more risk such as : 1 .
