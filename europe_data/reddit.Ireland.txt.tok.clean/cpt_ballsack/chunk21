  i suppose `` selling of vital infrastructure , resources and industry '' to highest foreign bidders is not `` corruption '' to you . 
  `` corruption is a form of dishonest or unethical conduct by a person entrusted with a position of authority , often to acquire personal benefit . 
  [ 1 ] corruption may include many activities including bribery and embezzlement , though it may also involve practices that are legal in many countries . 
  [ 2 ] government , or ` political ' , corruption occurs when an office-holder or other governmental employee acts in an official capacity for personal gain . '', 
  the conservatives are literally selling uk for their own gain . 
  i hope you see the irony of complaining about `` dem bloody foreigners '' and then selling large parts of the country to them ... 
   uk will just sell the fishing rights to other countries just like nuclear plants were sold to chinese , steel plants to indians , london to russians and so on but hey `` how can we blame the eu for our own corruption '', 
   nobody would let russia to be an absolute juggernaut . 
  one can not become a juggernaut with a victim complex like yours, 
  yep and we are at very end of long pipeline, 
  not they do n't , friends in it moved from london back here , they were shocked to learn they can get paid more here and have cheaper cost of living , the pound plummeting also wiped good chunk of their savings value, 
  whataboutism much ? 
  more importantly russia can roll it 's tanks over ee and germany can sit back and do nothing while gas continues to flow, 
  my geiger counter is on the rise, 
  relax think of them as insurance policy in case of zombie apocalypse, 
  a lot of the immigration to uk has little to do with eu , especially cultures coming from outside of europe , these people are came and continue coming to uk because of empire not because of eu . 
  brexit does nothing to fix that , if anything there probably will be more , we already have india saying any trade deal with uk will depend on easier migration for indians to uk, 
  that 's the same greenpeace who campaigned so hard against nuclear power that we ended up burning more coal for decades ? 
  instead of using nuclear power as way to cut carbon emissions while a renewable grid is build . 
  greenpeace have alot to answer for , instead of being pragmatists they are idealists, 
   you do n't have a lot of a specific immigrant group though lol ( only around 60,000 ) . 
  `` the polish minority in the republic of ireland numbered approximately 122,515 ( 2.57 % of the population ) according to 2016 census figures , about the same population as the whole of county waterford , the 15th most populous county in the republic , making it the largest minority in the country . 
  '' [ 1 ] in uk the largest minority [ 831,000 ] are polish too at 1.27 % of the population follow by indians [ 795,000 : whose migration to uk has nothing to do with eu ... ] @ 1.22 % [ 2 ] but hey who needs facts right ? 
  daily mail is a reliable source of facts ?!, 
  -------------- references : [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_minority_in_the_republic_of_ireland ) [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demography_of_the_united_kingdom ), 
  most of the immigrants live in the larger cities here which are quite dense , whats your point ? 
  this island btw had the same ( if not higher ) density while a member of the empire up to mid 19th century , we all know what happened then ... 
  the percentage of people living in ireland ( republic of ) that were born outside the country is double what it is in uk . 
  hell the polish language is now more spoken here than irish itself ... immigration is a `` problem '' only because your rabid tabloid media has chosen to make a big issue out of it . 
  here immigrants tend to integrate and assimilate into the irish culture . 
  and they import a lot more than they export, 
  so why does the rest ( majority ) of the muslim communities not loudly point fingers at these extremists and say `` hey there 's something seriously wrong with these lads '' by staying quiet they will endup being lumped in together with extremists , which is pretty much what these nutcases want . 
  all it takes for evil to prevail is for good men and women to say and do nothing . 
  we live in the alternate reality on this of the atlantic where our president donald t. is double double evil good, 
  ^ ^ coming from a scot thats incredibly ironic so you want empire 2.0 , no thank you , been there done that , being a eu member has proven an exponentially better experience for the country than being part of `` greater '' britain . 
   no offense but i do n't think ireland is a good example . 
  it relies on poaching companies from other countries . 
  there is a lot more factors to this running a business in this country than corporation tax rate . 
  and now that uk is deciding to commit sepuku there is even more reasons to setup here ... 
  the fact that you fallen for the stereotype is telling . 
   are there any actual examples of cutting corporate tax that lead to increased growth yes ireland ( ish ) , tho other taxes are extortionate and there are other factors for various companies to setup shop here ...  and a balanced budget no :(, 
  would those be eu regulations, 
  but they are necessary , you want freedom of movement of goods/services/capital without movement of people which means people ( uk and eu ) can not follow these and pursue better opportunities , you basically want to keep brits as prisoners on an island without opportunities . 
  imagine if florida did not allow people to move in and out yet interstate trade continued , imagine if scotland did n't allow people from rest of uk to move in and yet continued trade as now . 
  sound absurd ? 
  because it is , you were sold a lie by british press to keep you and other commoners in line and you fucking fell for it . 
   haha . 
  i wonder where those `` take it or leave it '' , `` no deal '' brexiters are now . 
  they are waiting for the ministry of internet access to issue their internet access permits, 
  argh ffs , we need more porn not less , if these young guys are too busy jerking off they might not find the time to go to certain mosques or syria to get brainwashed . 
  whats worse is that may 's solution is to ban porn there are bigger issues to be worrying about than going after wankers ... 
   the tree is the 1970s . 
  we had a bit of a rough patch . 
  in 1970s the uk was whole , who is to say the uk in 5-10 years would still compromise of 4 members ... and thatcher ( hate her or love her ) was actually cunning and capable ( strong and stable ? 
  all it takes for evil to prevail is for good men ( and women ) to do nothing ... 
  more notes to lurkers is that they brought in the silly 171 ( first half of 2017 ) and 172 ( 2nd half ) notation in order to spread sales more evenly across the year as people buying new cars used to hold off buying near the end of year , example reasoning of new car buyers here : why buy a car in december 2008 and be stuck with an have a 08 plate instead of waiting a month and same car would have a 09 plate government changed the notation from yy-county-id to yy ( 1 | 2 ) - county-id in 2013ish or so , car dealers of course were delighted since instead of one large bump in sales in january they now have two . 
  i think portugal does it right with the year and month of registration putting and end to this nonsense, 
   ukraine was a shitty trade partner , they ** stole ** transit gas and denied it now now , russia as a neighbor ** stole ** land from ukraine ( and others for that matter ) in not to recent past , and continues to do so ... 
  we will have a strong and stable + blue , red and white + no deal is better brexit, 
  it was a popular cruise destination actually , not anymore, 
  its bloody expensive to have 3 regions * of your country annexed . 
  and the rest of you country under threat of full annexation in space of days / s * regions that had natural resources ( coal , gas , oil ) and heavy industries ( steel ) and service industries ( tourism ), 
   ksa also emphasise on education . 
  if you have two balls in a sack ? 
  the eu wasted a year ? 
  do remind us how long the brexit vote was and how long until a50 was called and when will may get her act togeter to actually negotiate . 
  the way may is going there will be another election within a year . 
  strong and stable covfefe !, 
  they said realpolitik would have stopped brexit from happening and trump from being a president , yet here we are . 
  do no underestimate people , especially if they feel they have been insulted ( or in case of uk and polish people actually insulted , time and time again ), 
  [ in case any of the europeans here missed out on father ted  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x70bndpc70 ), 
   are there any laws against buying a mobile provider from another country and just using that instead then ? 
  i see people worrying about rising prices , but potentially you now just got access to all the carriers of the eu right ? 
  do you want to endup on mrs may 's terrorist watchlist ? 
  because thats how you will endup on one ... * this message is brought to you by concerned citizens for a strong and stable state !, 
  its ok we only like hanging cote d' ivore flags backwards , 
  ok no problems we just had a misunderstanding i now see we are on same page and what got us is language differences . 
  ok mate  no problems . 
  i truly feel sorry for ya , but i see with my own family ( here in west and back in russia ) how subversive the state russian language tv broadcasts are . 
  these propaganda ( and not very good once you are outside the box ) have the same theme , cover up corruption , blame all problems externally away from putin , push nationalist and religious talking points . 
  i actually feel very sorry for anyone who has to live in russia still , you are like frogs being slowly boiled alive by a giant toad who claims to be in the same pot as you but in reality has insulated himself . 
  the same toad who blames the rising temperatures and pressures externally while he continues to fatten himself up . 
  after replying to several of your posts its obvious english is not your strong point ( or you are drunk while typing these replies ) . 
  you write one thing and then further down in comments proceed to contradict yourself . 
  you are once again lumping the eu sanctions against putin and his merry band of oligarchs with the ** self sanctions ** that putin imposed on food imports . 
  european sanctions are not punishing innocents , putin is punishing innocents . 
  the fact that you can not separate the two apart shows just how well russian propaganda and state tv media brainwashing works . 
  and yes i still regularly watch in russian the satellite broadcasts . 
  my older relatives fall hook and line for the bullshit they regurgitate over and over again only for me to point out that they would not want their own grandchildren to grow up in russia nor would want themselves to move back and be pensioners there ... 
   it can be stopped , it ` just ' requires agreement by all member states . 
  i doubt many states would agree now , especially in eastern europe after having the uk govt and media slander them and their citizens as somehow being second rate and unwashed . 
  and i wouldnt blame them , the uk spent a year destroying goodwill and burning bridges, 
   i seriously have no idea anymore what sort of brexit the dup actually supports , i know they were pro-brexit , but foster said `` no hard brexit ! '', 
  the next day after the election , so which is it ? 
  the dup are a joke , they want a hard brexit yet they do not want all the economic , social and political fallout that this would bring to northern ireland . 
  basically they want rainbows and unicorns and pots of gold , but no leprechauns, 
   poor theresa . 
  the dictate of faceless eurocrats has no bounds . 
  they made her do it !, 
  so they are going to blame the eu for their disaster , shock horror !,
