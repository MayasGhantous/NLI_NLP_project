  i did not say there is no impact . 
  you clearly said few posts up that your countrymen suffered ** under european sanctions ** [ btw i was born in ussr and lived thru ' the collapse in 90s in russia , so my bullshit detector is much strong ] if there is an impact on russian people its due to putin , the sanctions are against putin and his cronies to make it harder for them to get away with their loot . 
  do you disagree against european sanctions against putin ? 
  should we have not done anything and let him and his cronies launder their loot ? 
  your post sounds like you are blaming europe for sanctions , if anything the sanctions did not go far enough . 
  they should seriously start following and seizing assets , properties and bank accounts of anyone remotely connected to russia . 
  europe should not be used a place for rich russians to launder their stolen bounty . 
   the sanctions are not relevant to the point i 'm attempting to express few posts up you wrote :  my countrymen have suffered so much under european sanctions due to his barbaric actions what european sanctions exactly have been placed against normal average russian people ? 
  the only sanctions in place are against putin and his oligarchs . 
   my countrymen have suffered so much under european sanctions due to his barbaric actions wow there hold your horses , the sanctions are against putin and his cronies . 
  are you referring to the food import ** self sanctions ** imposed by putin on the russian people ? 
   why do you have to be cruel ? 
  you 're right , we do n't have democracy , so we did n't have a say in our government taking crimea . 
  why should i as an individual be punished for that [ where have we heard the same argument before ? ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/world_war_ii_in_europe%2c_1942.svg ) . 
  you should n't be punished , but all it takes for evil to succeed is for good people to say and do nothing . 
  and right now evil is succeeding and them main losers are average russian people who are choosing to live under a corrupt neo-fascist sociopath who wrapped himself in the national flag while their country continues to decay . 
   and lest we forget , ode to joy in sergei prokofiev international airport , donetsk , 30/03/2014 [ yep we have n't forgotten how hope for a better ( and non-corrupt future ) was and is continuing to be crushed by russian tanks ] ( https://static.businessinsider.com/image/54c11bedecad042e769135d7/image.jpg ) more [ before and after photos ] ( https://www.businessinsider.com.au/ukraine-just-lost-the-crucial-donetsk-airport-to-russia-backed-rebels-and-the-photos-are-staggering-2015-1 ) of donetsk airport, 
   i 'm all for laughing at the uk , it 's fun and all , but it 's becoming more boring every day some of us have to live next to them ... 
   just withdraw a50 , if we say we 're not leaving , what are they going to do ? 
  drag us out ? 
  if only international treaties were like deals between 5 year olds ... 
  depends on what trade fallout will be at risk you are forgetting that the brits managed to seriously insult people and states in eastern europe with their holier than thou ' attitude and rhetoric constantly referring to other european citizens as second rate . 
  these states will want things in return for their vote , and i doubt those things ( freedom of movement ) will be palatable for uk uk government and their media spent a year destroying any good will , emotions will override any trade practicalities , mark my word . 
   which means all eu member states have to agree on this - good luck with that :d i mean i would not blame poland etc turning around and saying `` so uk , i hear you want an extension ? 
  so about that freedom of movement ... '', 
   why form a 32 county republic , when we can have 32 counties , a scotland , a wales , and an ** england ** ? 
  oh god . 
  no thank you . 
   am i missing something here ? 
  liberal democrats ... 
  tell me more, 
  base 2 is the best base clearly . 
  reddit , internet your and reddit computers run on binary 1001000010011011111101, 
  after annexations of parts of georgia and ukraine , we all know what `` friendly relations with russia '' looks like . 
  350 million a week to nhs of course, 
  `` never mind all that !, 
  how can we ban porn and fire more policemen ? 
  while i tend this magical money tree '' - may, 
   some do n't do it for political reasons ( supporting russia ) yet they do not want to move and live in russia , thats trump supporter level of hypocrisy right there, 
   `` this video contains content from channel 4 , who has blocked it in your country on copyright grounds '' soon ( thanks to may ) : `` this video contains porn , cant have any fapping about mate '', 
  you just have to live in russia for a little while to realize what a shitty place it is ( unless you are an oligarch ) , the fact that they want to spread their shitiness around is downright evil source : was born and lived in ussr and what followed before finally leaving the shithole behind, 
  what if it gets leaked on [ pornhub ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/pornhub-posts-putin-critics-documentary-after-russia-orders-delete-618387 ) [ lets ban porn ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-internet-regulated-london-bridge-terror-attack-google-facebook-whatsapp-borough-security-a7771896.html ) said no may ever / s, 
  national policies such as what exactly ? 
   the `` magic money tree '' line is very deliberate . 
  this line has been extensively focus grouped and polled and it wins votes for the tories . 
  landslide tory victory here we come . 
  a typical tory voter knows all about magical money trees , its called owning a house in england where housing prices rise well above inflation . 
  and banks , never forget the poor bankers , billions to them no problems, 
  depends on whom it profits , and how much access to power that whom has ... 
   stupidity is n't a crime . 
  claiming stupidity when standing in front of a judge especially for serious crimes such as treason never works . 
  experts who needs them / s, 
  trying to get on good side of trump ? 
  [ good god you are delusional . 
  you must me talking about 90 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2drub8aamm ), 
  like medvedev paid taxes for his palaces , vineyards and yachts ? 
  the middle east was/is fucked up on its own without any help, 
  there is nothing `` natural '' about corruption . 
  neither russian 's nor ukrainian 's are somehow predestined to be corrupt . 
  russian 's and ukranian 's who live/work in west are quite successful . 
  i was born in soviet union myself yet doing rather well here in west for last few decades . 
  so the problem is not with people but corrupt politicians who need to distract the populace with `` war , bread and circuses '' [ while they line their pockets and acquire palaces , yachts and wineyeards ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2drub8aamm ), 
  says the user with a name `` cocaine caravan '' jesus you putinbots dont even try hard anymore, 
   usually nothing , if you have your shit together as a country . 
  having `` your shit together '' is exactly what russia does not want . 
  it can not have yet another successful story on its borders as its people remain impoverished while putin and his oligarch buddies continue to rape the country and pad their offshore bank accounts . 
  russian propaganda is all about `` whataboutism '' its hard to say `` whatabout x '' when x is clearly a better run and more successful country than your stagnating shithole, 
  who said anything about feeding ? 
  if enough infrastructure is destroyed as per plan the people in the region will have to become refugees and leave , preferably in the ukraine 's direction . 
  yep uk minus bullshit + single market, 
  especially the petrol m sports versions , much power great fun, 
   what 's his fixation with the germans ? 
  i really hope he does n't try anything the eu and us getting into a trade conflict would only damage us both . 
  big hands . 
  strong grips . 
  good genes . 
  like ~ ~ mexicans ~ ~ syrians, 
  but but what about all the murdered journalists in the west ? 
  / s said no putinbot ever while reading from dear noncorrupt leader 's little whataboutism handbook, 
  [ is that what you call corruption by your own government ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2drub8aamm ) and oligarchs lording over 150 million plebs ?? 
  i would take `` western hypocrisy '' any day over `` russian hypocrisy '' , and before you get high and mighty with patriotism on me , i was born in ussr , quite likely long before young pups like yourself managed to get born and brainwashed, 
  actually the goal is to punish putin and he 's cronies , it 's only a coincidence the same corrupted fuck are in bed with german elites, 
  take eu money give them citizenship and buy them a one way ticket to germany which is where they want to be anyways . 
  yep notice how he kept his wealth in us dollars , and once the pound lost a good chunk of its value he suddenly had the cash to buy out sky , which he wanted for a long time . 
  he either doesnt understand basics of economics or he is deliberately being obtuse . 
  being an net importer and having a devaluing currency doesnt help , now on other other hand being a net exporter ( china , germany ) a weaker currency is of much help . 
  uk imports a lot more than it exports , pound devaluing does not help you http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/gbr/ * $ 606b in imports * $ 425b in exports to add insult to injury , a large portion of uk exports are services such as finance , something that trade deals do not cover ... 
  the referendum could be on brexit itself , example : 1 . 
  soft brexit ( basically same position in eu as norway ) 3 . 
  straight bananas libdems position is basically # 2 http://www.libdems.org.uk/europe, 
   half of us did n't . 
  this country and its government is a fucking joke . 
  how many of this half ( ish ) would actually vote for lib dems , who seem to be the only party mentioning having another referendum . 
  why yes i am , now do you want a red/white & blue dildo with that brexit sandwich ? 
  in case you have not noticed pretty much every region except for the south east of uk has suffered from continued mismanagement , yet they are about to re-elect the people who are responsible . 
  but hey lets blame the eu or < insert_boogeyman_here , 
  reminder that its now the poorest part of the island , down from the most industrious ... 
  losing access to market where 48 % of all uk exports go must be very worrying for every uk business that exports, 
   yeah what are they thinking , they are only the 5th world economy !, 
  they do n't have any power !,
