  used to be 1st and continues to fall ... hell the little ex british colony i live in now has higher living standard than uk look at the structure of the uk economy , its main output is in services , services mainly exported to the single market to which its about to lose access to , trade deals do not cover `` services '' . 
  well that 's what you get when there are lax regulations , and not wanting regulations was one of the reasons quoted for brexit . 
  [ the eu is ensuring this wont happen again ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/official_controls/food_fraud/horse_meat/timeline_en ) what is the uk government going to do about food safety and quality ? 
  i highly doubt its even on agenda, 
   the uk 's conservative party will release its election manifesto tomorrow . 
  naturally , key points have already been leaked to the press . 
  and the message is clear . 
  there will be no compromise on the ` red lines ' set out in theresa may 's speech at lancaster house on january 17th , 2017 . 
  * free movement of people will end ; * the uk will leave the single market and the customs union ; * and it will withdraw completely from the jurisdiction of the european court of justice . 
  --------------------- well that 's that so its going to be a red/white colored dildo inserted in to the rears of brits by tories . 
  sigh ... 
  considering that : 1 . the uk does not have enough land to feed its own large population and people there are not insane enough to want to starve . 
  2 . and they might not want to eat lower quality foods from god knows where ( full of god knows what ) then food exports from ireland to uk will continue , in meantime everyone here is already scrambling to diversify export markets . 
  and those that do n't make an attempt deserve to be wiped out in 2 years time . 
   i would really hate to punish brits who believed in eu integration for what brexiters did . 
  we must be better than that . 
  can they not apply for passports after living in the country for 5 + years ? 
  there are queues at the irish passport office from uk citizens give the best and the brightest citizenship and leave the rest behind in their own cesspool to read daily mail , fatten themselves up and watch goglebox, 
   exactly , i am already sick of hearing about brexit and what the brits want yep the rest of us 450 million odd people in eu want a good deal to benefit us , i couldnt care if the next island over sinks into the atlantic by this stage , there has been so much bullshit in the last year coming from over there its getting quite annoying . 
  if they do not want to negotiate let em go off without a deal . 
  i ca n't wait for him to give a multicolored shamrock bowl to trump come next st patrick 's day :d ( that 's assuming trump lasts that long , and/or we are not living in the fallout 4 universe ), 
   and the turnout was incredibly low well they would know better next time ( if there is a nextime :o ), 
  how ? 
  thats easy , they bought a house in london why was it not seized and criminal proceedings started is a better question, 
  maybe volga had more volume of water from glaciers ? 
  good question , notice the path to black sea as well, 
  wan na swap country location ? , it 's getting disturbing being stuck between trump and may , while it continues to rain, 
  nhs cutting down on medications ? 
   what does this have to do with russias involvement ? 
  every thread about russia has to have ( at least one ) whataboutism post . 
  call it putin 's law . 
  edit : this one has several , they even start with `` whatabout x '', 
  til , thanks good point, 
   mary lou will probably be leader of sinn f\u00e9in god help us :( look they are basically `` reverse ukip '' with unification as their main issue/focus . 
  their other policies are either highly populist to grab votes or inconsistent or downright silly ( especially when it comes to economics yes other parties suck too but nowhere near as much , and then we have a whole scrabble of independents . 
  imho if anything sinn fein will endup hindering any unification due to their historical baggage and policies . 
  in the south sinn fein aint exactly popular yet large portion of the population is catholic . 
  simply because most of their policies are rubbish ( never mind the lingering smell of the ira ), 
  as we are seeing with brexit economics doesnt seem to enter in the equation of people ( no matter how badly it might turn out for them ) i would be worried about an `` insurgency '' from hardcore unionists ( whatever their beef ) in case of a reunion , our gardai simply wont be able to handle them, 
  i doubt that segment would relocate , what we could endup is a lot of trouble from the unionist side :(, 
  reunification is a loooooooong way off ( if ever ) what brexit will lead to is further reduced living standards and less jobs for people in the north , and of course 40,000 job losses this side of the border . 
  but hey `` strong and stable '' is the slogan of the day ... 
  have you seen the replies in this and parallel threads ? 
  i aint the one measuring [ moles ] ( http://www.visionlearning.com/en/library/chemistry/1/the-mole/53 ) of salt, 
  well her body language sure was interesting ... and now seeing all the hoopla in uk press and here on reddit its no wonder , your tabloids are trying to create another `` scandal '' and further stroke nationalism/victimhood sentiment, 
  i tell you what , why dont you guys exit eurovision too :d , sick of all this moaning then form your own commonwealthvision  and proceed to get demolished in it as has happened with various sports invented in england but perfected elsewhere in commonwealth , lol, 
  they do that everytime , try to downplay the size of protests . 
  but she did not sing an `` amazing opera '' , what fecking alternate reality have you crawled out of ? 
  oh please get off your fucking high horse , she was good ( better than our guy lol !, 
  ) , but she definitely was not the best . 
  the uk eurovision representative ( the one that was giving out the scores ) was all weird yesterday , her body language was all defensive/pissed off [ her arms were crossed ] also no smile either [ in contrast to everyone else ] . 
  it was a bit surreal , there must be some sort of `` them vs us '' mentality taking over across the little pond . 
  it 's rather sad actually , no the world is not out to get them . 
  its only a fecking cheesy song competition , relax guys, 
   in 50 years and + the students will thanks them to give more context in 50 years students will have an alt history class `` for balance '' / shudders, 
   firstly because we actually export a lot of services hate to break it to you , but services will be hit the hardest in uk due to brexit since may is hell bent on leaving single market , and trade deals always focus on goods . 
  it be cool alright except between ireland and portugal is bay of biscay which goes down to something like 4km in depth :0 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bay_of_biscay#/media/file:celtic_sea_and_bay_of_biscay_bathymetric_map-en.svg, 
  less trade means less jobs , its as simple as that . 
   something like 5 % of eu trade is with the uk . 
  40 % of uk trade is in the free market [ i had thread on this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56g8h1/who_would_be_hurt_the_most_in_a_ukeu27_tradewar/ ) * eu27  uk 5.5 % of exports ( average . 
  highest is ireland at 19.2 % down to 1.4 % for croatia ) * uk  eu27 48.9 % of exports but anyways , these brexiters are in their own alternate universe , where facts are also alternate, 
  only if the referendum has a supermajority of over 69 %, 
  fun fact , for the 60 + billion we poured into our banks we could have built a tunnel ( using channel tunnel prices ) from cork ( thereabouts ) to france . 
  its fairly shallow the depth all of the way ( no deeper than the channel ) . 
  half of europeans reading this wish they were `` liberated '' too by us instead of soviets ... 
   more like crotchety old timer that 's mad at the world because it 's not as strong or attractive as it used to be . 
  who does n't like blowjobs from pretty young eastern europeans and irish ? 
  invents a sport , creates a commonwealth league , still gets annihilated . 
  more sanctions against putin and his thugs , start by making it illegal for people/entities connected to russia to stash their money in eu , in property for example . 
  watch the rats then turn on putin . 
   if they go down our own economy will take a kick to the nuts . 
  so i 'm wishing them well . 
  there 's nothing we can do but watch in horror the slow train-wreck that brexit is . 
  at the end of the day 48 % of their exports goto eu27 , that will hurt them alot more than us . 
  apparently worst case scenario for us is [ 40,000 jobs ] ( http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/hard-brexit-will-lead-to-40000-job-losses-in-ireland-economist-warns-773192.html ) while that is bad its nowhere near as bad as it was during the depths of the great recession . 
  to put things into perspective 40,000 people left ranks of unemployed in 2016 alone . 
   the figures suggested the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the brexit vote did little to boost exports in march , despite making british goods cheaper abroad . 
  well there goes that argument  industrial output dropped by 0.5 % in march , sharper than the 0.3 % fall predicted by economists . 
  it followed a 0.7 % fall in february and brought the sector to a virtual standstill in the first quarter overall , with growth of just 0.1 % they are not even out of the eu and yet ... 
   would n't be a need for carry-on if they gas everyone on the plane . 
  looks at flair :0, 
  other people wanting a different ( saner ) outcome for their country and people , does n't make sense , right ... 
  who elected you the spokesman mr farage ? 
  so you want uk to be treated like egypt , algeria and jordan ? 
  like i said , if its such an important matter to them to quite literally leave the current eu , off they go . 
  28 countries signed up to the last treaty , one is currently leaving . 
  a new treaty would require approval in all the states ( good luck there ) the alternative is to leave eu and form own club . 
  once again good luck with that . 
  once again they can form their own subclubs , but they can not in the process ignore the existing lisbon treaty or go against it without actually leaving the eu ( via article 50 ) look if macron and merkel decide the people of their countries should stand at the border and wave ( their dicks ) at each other , they can . 
  they can not however drag the other 25 members against their will into their mass dicks waving competition , because lisbon . 
  ! remindme 5 years `` does the uk still exist ? 
  with all of its current members '', 
  eu regulations are actually beneficial to uk economy well imagine that ... 
  off they go , lisbon treaty allows for subgroups to form ( hell we already have shengen etc ) , lets say they make a common taxation group they can not however force others to join , as that would violate the treaty they signed . 
  the only way out would be to leave the current eu and make their neu , but that would hurt these countries the most ... 
   might wan na move a couple of sheep , tho . 
  kebabxit triggered, 
   not being part of schengen definitely helps . 
  being on an island definitely helps , many of times i have traveled in without the gardai at border point even raising his head to take a look . 
  to be honest , sadly i think its only a matter of time :(,
