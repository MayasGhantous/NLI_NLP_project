  calm down and stop getting snarky and `` holier than thou ' '' i actually agree with alot of your points the problem is that this `` reform '' would mean creating a new treaty and getting people and government across europe to agree on it , and in the process give more power to eu . 
  i do not think that will happen ( lisbon treaty giving eu its current shape barely passed !, 
  ) , and all of eu energy will be tied up on the topic of brexit for the next few years, 
   there have n't been any islamist attacks in ireland knocks wooden table , because our gardai repeatedly tell us they are not prepared for it . 
  also apparently our airports are the only ones in europe where armed police are told to stay on the boundary and not patrol with weapons showing . 
   the narrative `` sure the eu is fawlty but the alternative is worse '' is starting to lose ground faster and faster . 
  if the eu is fawlty it has to be fixed and reforms have to be implemented . 
  if reforms are not implemented , then a multi-speed eu will have to be the alternative . 
  i keep hearing talk of `` reform '' but when one asked for details one is met with either silence or `` reform '' which would either mean taking apart eu or making it a superstate and taking power away from people/countries in the process . 
  oh and yes the alternatives could be much much worse . 
  people in western europe think they have problems ( doesnt help to be fueled by constant media attention on the negatives ) but current `` issues '' are minor compared to what the rest of the worlds population faces ( and especially those further east ), 
  a threat ? 
  lol from my extensive travels and friends there it be hard for them to point at ireland on a map :d never mind harbor any bad-will considering we basically built that country . 
  trump my be a threat in the form of him starting a nuclear war and us being close to uk ending up irradiated too ( and/or overrun by brittish refugees ) but thats so far into the realm of theory ... 
  here is the funny bit i was born in ussr ( quite likely long before you were born ) , and yes whataboutism is tactic we see alot here , at end of day it was you who called yourself a putinbot . 
  eu might have alot of problems , but i experienced first hand the alternative of having to queue for bread as a child and witnessing the corruption that followed ( which only got worse ) my grandfather who fought in ww2 would be spinning in his grave on this day today !, 
  if he knew of what modern russia has become ( a neo fascist state so closely resembling who he fought ) . 
  [ whatabout ( ha lol ) your own economy @fepeak ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.pp.cd?locations=ie-ru ) eu might have a lot of problems , but it sure hell better for the average person than your alt < reich  ernative . 
  our position in atlantic would be quite strategic tho for any supply lines across the ocean , things like airfields . 
  and a base of operations for anti submarine helicopters . 
  yeh as an owner of a small company for 10 years now i would love to avail of 0.01 % rate instead of the 12.5 % rate to which i paid thousands . 
  tho ' it doesnt surprise me in slightest that our government has cut backroom casting couch deals ... 
   the nost surprising aspect for me was that 57 % of people wanted to join a common european defence 10 years ago * we did n't have neo fascist invading other european countries * and people would have laughed at the idea of uk leaving the eu * and terrorism to irish people meant domestic ira kind , not islamists running rampant thru ' europe, 
  i was born in ussr went to school in its dying days ( yes i 'm old ) i was absolutely fascinated to learn war did not start in summer 41 and there was whole pacific theatre , also on tv was constant hero war films . 
  my grandfather fought and got medals for capturing pows and bravery , he would be spinning in his grave now seeing how fascist modern russia under putin become . 
  i regret not learning more of the war and his moonshine recipe before he sadly lost his mind and died :(, 
  the soviets trained germans on their soil going back to 20s , how that turn out ? 
  sphere of influence sounds so warm and fuzzy ( promised land of flowing vodka and caviar ) , how about you stop using euphemisms and use occupation or/and subjugation . 
  has putin blown his load [ :d ] on the us election , and now that we know what his meddling looks like ( yet again ) it is not working as well in europe ? 
  the continent of westeros sort of resembles the [ larger of the british isles in its shape plus a larger upside down ireland ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ejkpvgp.jpg ) , tho ' the 7 kingdoms of westeros [ take up truly enormous landmass ] ( http://i.imgur.com/edolion.jpg ), 
  seeing how pound is down what 15-20 % in last year since brexit , alot of russian 's oligarchs are looking at worlds worst performing `` investment '' returns, 
   1 % of people thought ireland should become more like greece . 
  ok then . 
  well if the eu pays for more sunlight :d sure why not !, 
  i am all for being towed into the middle of the mediterranean , it sucks being stuck between trump on one side and tories on the other . 
  well its probably for the best , we would have had to change the flag so often in last 30 years otherwise . 
  think of it as the eu being efficient with our tax money , imagine the british tabloids otherwise `` dem germanz wasted x million on extra stars '', 
   communism is only egalitarian in the sense that it eventually kills everyone . 
  communism is only egalitarian in the way that it makes everyone ( except dear leaders ) equally poor . 
  exactly , indian cloth making industry was absolutely decimated in 19th century as they were out competed by british mills . 
  one person could do the job of hundreds out of a sudden , thanks to new inventions . 
   thriving silicon valley does n't really matter to an east coast factory worker though 1817 : thriving manchester does n't really matter to a yorkshire sheep farmer though . 
  you see the point i am trying to make ? 
  where would we be now if goat herders and luddites managed to stop and reverse the first industrial revolution ... 
  `` stay calm and keep buggering on ? '', 
  see [ my other post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/69pu2l/chris_johns_identity_politics_will_not_solve/dh8l0yg/ ) in this thread , we are thinking along same lines , 
  could be an urban legend , there was something about the ash from certain volcanic soils being key to it . 
  they also did not put in rebar which rusts . 
   manufacturing jobs both trump and may have promised in various ways to bring back low paid , unskilled manufacturing jobs ( they do n't put it quite like that , of course ) but have yet to show any sign of knowing how to achieve this ( they ca n't , it 's impossible ) . 
  here is the problem , we are currently undergoing yet another industrial revolution , this time in high tech industries { computing , biotech , healthcare , energy , pharma etc } also the world can not compete with china . 
  china is basically the modern day equivalent of a star trek replicator , just stop for a minute and think of what would happen to economies if there was a factory full of replicators in location called china owned by a single entity ( `` communist ( lol ) party of china ltd '' ) , then look around . 
  we might not have the technology but the outcome is the same . 
  trump proposed ( and rowed back since ) addressing this `` replicator '' problem by basically going to war with them . 
  the alternative is to innovate and upskill . 
  countries and people that can not do that will be left behind to compete with our star trek style replicator . 
  countries such as germany `` get it '' , yes they have industry but its based on constant innovation , japan `` got it '' but got lost somewhere along the way . 
  regions in us such as silicon valley `` get it '' . 
  now the question you should ask yourself is , do you `` get it '' . 
  the future is now . 
  we might not have star trek style technology but whole global economies are being disrupted as if the tech is here . 
   now , the question is : what will solve the economic problem ? 
  well brexit sure as hell wont solve economics problems , if anything it will make it worse ( and not just for brits themselves ) but hey if you say that you get branded as a `` fearmonger '' and `` but but the economy is doing great '' ( ignoring that uk is still in single market and eu , us and rest of world are going thru the upside of economic wave ) so i can see why he stopped at making economic prescription . 
  his article correctly identifies the insanity and inherent contradictions of neo-nationalism sweeping across the world . 
  i thought the formula for roman concrete was long lost ? 
  did they just pour in modern day concrete which is not capable of lasting as long ? 
   you are n't russia yet . 
  thank [ fucking ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blaspheme ) god for that, 
   how do they know where the road is ? 
  poles or gps ? 
  follow the center line ? 
  a bigger question is how are those roads not endup destroyed with so much snow and ice on top ? 
   what do you mean by `` poor as fuck '' ? 
  compared to the richest countries on the world ? 
  maybe . 
  compared to the rest of the world ? 
  no , no and no . 
  [ you dont have to compare to west , look to the east ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.cd?locations=ru-cn ) china used to be 10x smaller gdp per capita than russia in 1990 , now its same ( if not more ) a 2500 % increase per capita , compared to 172 % increase and falling in rf all with a falling population , its incredible bad luck or bad mismanagement ( take a pick ), 
  russian empire ~ 165 million 100 years later russia ~ 144.5 million [ aside whole country has come full circle to having tsar ( s ) with palaces , vineyards and yachts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2drub8aamm ) while population remains piss poor compared to europe ( hell even [ china is overtaking them now ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.cd?locations=ru-cn ) after having a 10x smaller gdp per capita than russia at collapse of ussr ), 
  nice try putin, 
  lol considering it was uk who repeatedly held up this vat lowering by trying to drag in other shit https://www.ft.com/content/5bba17d0-7743-11e6-a0c6-39e2633162d5 https://www.bna.com/eu-vat-ebook-n57982083673/ now that uk is leaving things will work much smoother . 
  you said `` almost as many people voted for him '' farage ! = ukip 2 . 
  4 million is still a smaller number than 4.7 million but yeh why am i arguing with a smelly fart . 
  yep and thankfully these would be going now along with roaming etc yet another good thing to come out of eu, 
  neither does ireland ( except bizarrely schoolbooks ) however both do have a vat on ebooks at moment , check amazon.co.uk kindle pages :(, 
   how ? 
  that 's the problem ; this is asymmetrical . 
  we ca n't fuck up their elections ; it 's a dictatorship . 
  send a boatload of rainbow painted baguettes to the kremlin . 
   foreign publications like russia today ? 
  correct horse battery comrade, 
  the bigger problem is no new houses being built due to a mixture of factors : 1 . 
  construction industry being destroyed 10 years back 2 . 
  strange fetish for low rise construction , dublin is very low density . 
  taxes 4 . 
  red tape 5 . 
  planning 6 . 
  government not doing enough to spread out investment across the country . 
  the problem is very much limited to dublin and 1-2 other cities , outside there are still ghost estates and empty villages . 
  but hey lets blame airbnb like a simpleton would for all these problems . 
  i have an idea , why does n't he slap a tourist tax on amsterdam , prague ( whatever other city in this thread feels its drowning from tourism and their money ) and use the proceeds to advertise for tourism into ireland .
