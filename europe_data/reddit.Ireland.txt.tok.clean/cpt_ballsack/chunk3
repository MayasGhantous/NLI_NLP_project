  the owners would have to move to uk , getting paid in british rubles with the queens head on it while living in ireland leaves the owners at square one . 
  2 . who knows how far the swing into lala land would continue , what happens if uk endsup like venezuela where foreign owned companies got taken over , unthinkable says you ? 
  so was brexit !, 
  when the owners of this business decided to invoice in pounds and not euro did they ever imagine a brexit would occur ?? 
  once the uk leaves the eu in 2-3 years this factory might have troubles exporting to the rest of its customers outside the uk 4 . 
  there is already talk of crazy laws such as having to list uk and nonuk employees ( despite the government already having that data ) , what happens if the uk makes a new law where the mushrooms have to blue , red and white in color or something equally as daft . 
  way to much uncertainty !, 
  anyways the owners of this enterprise are looking for state handouts due to making business decision ( invoicing in pounds ) that has now proven ( due to unexpected brexit vote ) to be a bad one . 
  who knows , if the eu agreement could be kicked to the curb then what else can be rewritten . 
  take the european human rights which apparently will go , good friday agreement is based on this and mentions it multiple times thruout the text opening another can of worms better left closed . 
  brexit has opened a pandora 's box of uncertainties , uncertainty is bad for business . 
  i certainly would not want to risk my money in a country that is making shit up as it goes . 
  if they were billing in euro ( which they should have been if they had any business sense since eur <  gbp had plenty of swings in past , albeit not as large ) then whoever is buying their products in uk can either : 1 . 
  try to find the same quality product locally 2 . 
  pay more in pounds 3 . 
  forget about buying this product seeing how the uk imports most of its food to feed its population and does not have the land to produce it all locally , the choice becomes 1 . 
  loose some weight 2 . 
  pay more 3 . 
  import lower quality food from outside eu , which is a problem and not really an option while they remain in eu , once they do leave they can import mushrooms from chernobyl of wherever ... 
  the owners of this enterprise took a huge gamble in sending their invoices out in a currency other than what their costs , and they lost now that pound is rapidly loosing value . 
  that 's business for you , granted they probably could not have predicted that there will be a brexit . 
  it would be the same if i had a marmite factory here and only accepted payment in bitcoins and then bitcoin price plummeted or something . 
  ask yourself `` why is russia experiencing an economic crisis ? '', 
  i will ignore the rest of your acidic comment , you are welcome to come here and work and see what sort of a tax heaven ireland is , where you will endup in the 50 % + tax bracket if you endup on any job paying more than average wage and above . 
  i recommend you look at a map , it be faster for illegal migrants to swim to uk than to swim to ireland , and if they do get here somehow lets not forget the 6 counties to which there is no physical border ... edit : if the pound keeps falling and uk becomes poorer the number of illegal migrants wanting to come to uk will drop, 
  yes but brexit throws a spanner into the cta and more importantly good friday agreement also without the uk being in eu there is nothing stopping us from joining schengen , whole reason we ended outside schengen was to accomodate the uk . 
  fine one million euros converted into whatever the british ruble is worth at the time the point remains , it be highly risky proposition opening a factory in uk if you are not from uk and of course in a few years the same factory will find itself unable to export outside the uk to add insult to injury edit : oh and have to make lists of british and non british employees . 
  right why would i come to uk and spend a million euros in creating a factory to make green + white + orange dildos ^ tm only to be told in a few years that i am no longer welcome and have to go home losing my investment . 
  since i am putting the local red + blue + white dildo ^ tm enterprise out of business or whatever ... 
  that would make the owners , managers and workers of this factory immigrants in the uk , immigrants from other eu countries are apparently no longer welcome . 
  the owners might decide to close factory here and open one in uk only to find in a few years that they are longer welcome there and are shown the door , losing everything . 
  this happened to all sorts of businesses in venezuela for example . 
   but but the uk is just a small irrelevant country , so how could it economically effect other countries ? 
  [ as you can see from this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56g8h1/who_would_be_hurt_the_most_in_a_ukeu27_tradewar/ ) ireland would be the most affected after uk in any sort of a tradewar . 
  ** right now the uk is still in eu and enjoys free access to eu market ** ( for another 2-3 years anyways ) once they are out things would get interesting , tariffs could be slapped on lets say british cars and the money distributed to economies/sectors most affected by brexit . 
  this happens all the time which is why free trade and single markets are so important , it spares all sides from crap like this . 
  irish suppliers of mushrooms have 3 choices : 1 . 
  close 2 . 
  find new markets 3 . 
  increase prices to uk or charge them in euro the solution will be a combination of the above , once the uk actually leaves they could petition the eu for countermeasures to be places to compensate them by punishing a similar uk sector . 
  the [ us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protective_tariff ) and eu does this all the time for example with respect to external countries . 
  not trying to catch you out , just trying to wrap my head around what `` moderate '' level headed russians would consider a reputable source ( s ) . 
  often here on reddit any mention of russia gets derailed with usual tactics of 1 . 
  where is the proof ?!, 
  there is no proof !, 
  whataboutism x y z over there ?!, 
  its getting rather tired and old to be honest . 
  reputable news sources such as ? 
  tell us how did the `` russian economic benefits '' benefited the turkish tourist industry after that plane was shot down ? 
  once again you are missing the 180kg bear in the room `` quality of living russia is kinda shitty '' is a direct result of the present russian political climate ( as well as the past ussr political climate ) . 
  maybe the quality of living in russia would not be as shitty if their politics not flip flop from one extreme of `` communist socialism '' to the current extreme of `` neo fascism/nationalism '' . 
  a country does not need to appear `` stronk '' to give its people a good standard of living edit : down voting my comment without replying is the equivalent of sticking your fingers in ears and singing `` la la la '', 
  in your rush to defend putin you missed my point , here it is again maybe if instead of making enemies of its neighbors by annexing their lands ( as if the largest country in world needs more land ? 
  ) , bombing people in middle east or threatening the world with nuclear armageddon your `` government '' and tsar putin actually concentrate on improving the standards of living for russians , russia would be great , but unfortunately for you it is not . 
  * ireland gdp per person $ 50,503.42 usd ( 2013 ) * russia gdp per person $ 14,611.70 usd ( 2013 ) * ireland # 6 on human development index @ 0.916 * russia # 50 on human development index @ 0.798 [ 1 ] yes apples and oranges . 
  one country is democratic and hence has politicians that are kept in check and constantly prodded to improve the standard of living for its population . 
  the other country is `` democratic '' ( notice the quotes ) and where the population is constantly prodded by its politicians and distracted by foreign escapades from the continued economic mismanagement and stagnation ( sound familiar ? ) . 
  [ 1 ] * `` the human development index ( hdi ) is a composite statistic of life expectancy , education , and income per capita indicators . 
  a country scores higher hdi when the life expectancy at birth is longer , the education period is longer , and the income per capita is higher . 
  it is used to distinguish whether the country is a developed , a developing or an underdeveloped country . 
  its ok tayto are fairly rubbish , lays are better , can get them from any polish shops here , 
   got ta have as many enemies as possible to keep the military machine active and profitable . 
  got ta have as many enemies as possible to distract the sheeple from continued economic stagnation and stupidity of self sanctions . 
   23.3 billion to help out the poorer regional bugets . 
  thats 330 million euro , or ~ 2 euro for each russian man , woman and child wow russia stronk for comparison , in the irish budget last week , pensions and welfare payments are going up by $ 5 ** per week ** and thousands of new nurses and police are being recruited . 
  thats a country of 4-5 million that instead of swinging its dick around the middle east and threatening the world with nuclear annihilation is actually taking care of its people , despite having a 31x smaller population and a 3x smaller economy and not having any natural resources ... 
  olive oil from british olive trees ? 
   how do you respond to a missile shield by creating a joint defense deal ? 
  they make their own shield except with hookers and rum, 
  china does not view russia as an equal either , this will be very interesting . 
  here is the problem ( for russia ) they can not afford another cold war style arms race , they can be outspend on a 10x basis for each ruble they spend . 
  last time they tried coupled with low oil prices and decades of stagnation , whole thing fell apart . 
  here is the kicker , they have not even left yet . 
   leaked government papers suggest that leaving the single market and switching to world trade organisation ( wto ) rules would cause gdp to fall by up to 9.5 % lets put things into context uk great recession drop was 6-7 % , took 8-9 years to recover , who wants to go again for a deeper dive ? 
  if all trade breaks down with eu completely the drop would be up to 13.5 % as was recently discussed in a thread here but i am no expert so feel free to listen to me, 
  if only it was that simple , employees would endup with no employers under your proposal . 
  which goes back to my post about more taxpayers being a welcome addition, 
  are you going to keep editing your posts ? 
  when you get an answer you do not like , or do i have to start quoting you in full ? 
   if what you 're saying is true , and ireland is extremely accommodating , then why did it introduce a work permit scheme for countries that joined in 2007 ? 
  ironically enough pressure from uk from what i remember was the reason , since uk were afraid people from those 2 countries would use ireland as a stepping stone . 
  these restrictions were n't enforced and were lifted 2 years before the uk did it . 
  did i say that ? 
  my wording is very clear , let me make it clearer again and repeat myself so : the barrier to entry to ireland was lower than uk and we ended up with a larger portion of the population being ` expats ' working here , paying taxes etc. 
  and despite all of that and having similar problems as uk ( housing , unemployment , public services etc ) we do not blame our problems on migrants or the eu , we rightly put the blame on the feet of our politicians . 
  going back to your original point  i expect this position would rapidly change if eu migration levels to ireland started to approach those those of the uk . 
  eu migration levels do not approach those of uk , they are almost double it !, 
  the whole brexit argument of eu migration somehow being the root of all sorts of issues is bullshit based on lies . 
  edit : way to completely edit your post, 
  kindly inform yourself https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_enlargement_of_the_european_union * united kingdom : welfare restrictions only , need to register though . 
  * ireland : no restrictions . 
  as per my comment `` ireland had no restrictions on migration from the new states ( unlike the uk ) '', 
  when a pile of eastern european states joined the eu in 2004 ireland had no restrictions on migration from the new states ( ** unlike the uk ** ) , most of those who came here are still here despite the great recession and overall have been a net positive for ireland . 
  so you do keep waiting and shifting goalposts when facts presented do not match your warped worldview, 
   i expect this position would rapidly change if eu migration levels to ireland started to approach those those of the uk . 
  you said \u2206 and i illustrated with facts that we have more eu expats ( and migrants overall ) than uk already , as well as a rapidly growing population . 
  except we do not blame migrants or eu for our very similar domestic issues such as lack of housing , unemployment ( higher than uk ) , bad public service etc etc so yes very relevant, 
  8.6 % of population of ireland was born in eu 4.8 % of population of uk was born in eu ----------------- 13.1 % of population of ireland was born outside ireland ( eu and noneu ) 11.7 % of population of uk was born outside uk ( eu and noneu ) ------------------ irish population is up 64.81 % [ 1972-2016 ] since we became a eu member uk population up 19.56 % [ 1972-2015 ] since they became a eu member, 
  beats me the data is all there already in various uk govt/state computers, 
  income taxes go above 50 % once you hit about 34000 $ a year , some tax heaven,
