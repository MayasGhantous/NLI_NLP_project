  they can get this data from hmrc who already knows where everyone is employed and how much they are paid , ( also social security numbers would have citizenship info attached to it ) without creating red tape ( so much for eu heaping needless bureaucracy on british business ) businesses have enough forms to fill as is, 
  they are welcome to come to ireland , we do not say no to `` foreigners '' who come here to work and pay taxes, 
   ` british people first ' mentality . 
  so i suppose or those foreign footballers and managers should be shown the door and replaced with johnny englishmen ? 
  wait so its made from cement and not carved out of a rock ? 
  wow, 
  so the `` bright shining beacon of growth in europe '' is romania and not the uk as we are repeatedly told ? 
  wow there is going to be much butthurt, 
  where is the proof ? 
  whatabout the us ? 
  should we not change the title to `` every eu ** expat ** . . '' , 
   are you fucking retarded ... 48 % of uk exports go to 27 countries . 
  5 % of all 27 countries exports goes to the uk ... 
  this is not something that can be directly compared with in the way that you are and is incredibly misleading by using flat percentagea / takes a deep breath your are not negotiating with 27 individual countries but a single block where each member would need to be satisfied and the whole lot need to be made happy in order to sign off on a trade deal with uk . 
  [ sure ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56g8h1/who_would_be_hurt_the_most_in_a_ukeu27_tradewar/d8j9a8e ), 
  [ this is for goods and services and your point is already addressed higher up ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56g8h1/who_would_be_hurt_the_most_in_a_ukeu27_tradewar/d8j2a45 ), 
  one could argue that it would be much higher now if the yuan was not kept artificially low ... 
  sure : here is comma separated values text http://pastebin.ca/3726488 all data is from : http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/ mit site has no figures for belgium and luxembourg ( for whatever reason ) , i had to get 2014 figures for those two from : http://globaledge.msu.edu/countries/belgium/tradestats http://globaledge.msu.edu/countries/luxembourg/tradestats values are in billions of usd for 2014 ( couldnt find much data thats more recent ), 
  data for them is here : http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/gbr/, 
   russia really does n't want europe to be unite besides sanctions against the thugs close to putin the last thing russia needs is a common energy policy and having all of eu members bargain as one when it comes to gas/oil negotiations . 
  but that 's a whole other thread possibly one of the tactics for may could be an attempt to somehow have the eu fall apart ( not sure how they can do this , we europeans just laugh at british tabloid nonsense ) , since only then do any trade negotiations approach any sort of equality . 
  if you go thru each country on the list , under imports and export there is the amount ( and % ) of trade with uk , isolating by europe makes it easier to see in some cases . 
  there is probably a few small discrepancies for example i seen gibraltar being counted separate to uk for some reason on one of these pages . 
  also that mit site has no figures for belgium and luxembourg ( for whatever reason ) , i had to here for 2014 figures for those two : http://globaledge.msu.edu/countries/belgium/tradestats http://globaledge.msu.edu/countries/luxembourg/tradestats, 
  i dunno , ireland is not in nato , why would the uk want to withdraw from nato ? 
  i doubt south korea had any issues with straight bananas :d, 
  tbh the us is a very special case , if they ( for whatever reason ) default who exactly would come knocking to ` collect ' their losses while the us keeps maintaining a military larger than the rest combined . 
  we live in an incredible time when chinese are actively keeping their population poor in order to send products to us in exchange for nothing more than ious on green paper . 
  anyways thats all going off on a tangent from the subject of brexit , what i am trying to say comparing the uk to us is rather difficult . 
  hold your horses , there was a thread about it here yesterday somewhere http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/718615/world-trade-organisation-brexit-deals-can-t-happen-unless-163-countries-agree http://www.politico.eu/article/forget-brussels-brexits-toughest-battleground-is-the-wto-uk-theresa-may/ if you think agreeing to a deal with 27 countries will be hard , getting agreements from 163 would not be easier . 
  hey my balls already dropped :d, 
  goto http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/gbr/ 1 . 
  take the total export figure 2 . 
  get export figures to other eu27 states from uk 3 . 
  calculate total and derive percentage its all in screenshot above, 
   the uk has no problem with free trade , they do n't need a whole host of tariffs . 
  free trade requires equal laws regarding things such as quality ( to prevent manufacturers in one country from flooding other country with subpar products ) and legal arbitration seeing how : * brexiters have a big issue with eu rules and regulations * uk is being pulled out of european convention on human rights ( echr ) * uk does not want to be subject to european courts i do not see how `` free '' trade can be achieved . 
  ** in order to have free trade there needs to be a level playing field ** brexiters have made it very very clear that they do not want to play on the worlds largest level playing field any more . 
  and that 's before we get to the crucial point of free movement of eu citizens . 
  because the uk is still in the eu and will remain so for another 2-3 years , need to distinguish somehow call it euexuk if you wish, 
  screenshot above has the exact figures for 2014 as well as % s the range of losers on eu27 side goes from 14 % ( ireland ) down to 1.4 % ( croatia ) , median @ 5.1 % , ireland is the one dragging the average up to 5.5 % , like i said a clear outlier . 
  this is compared with uk at ~ 49 %, 
  well [ its currently going in the opposite direction ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dltxzir.png ) btw i doubt chinese meat and veg have the same quality standards when it comes to food as any of the eu exporters who are feeding good chunk of the uk population now . 
  never mind not being as fresh coming half way around the world ... 
  i made a mistake in linking to gdp per person graph ( similar trajectories ) edit : well if are going to talk in gdp per person then please also include ireland :d, 
  data is for 2014 in $ usd billions, 
  it is `` just recovering '' it took until 2015 for uk gdp to reach pre great recession levels , 8 years it took , similar to here in ireland [ here is how the uk gdp looks like ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oamgus5.png ) and [ here is the `` bright spot for economic growth '' looks like ] ( http://i.imgur.com/adr4xtz.png ), 
  losing 13.5 % of uk gdp would be disaster considering uk lost ~ 7 % of its gdp during the great recession of few years back and is only now recovering almost a decade later . 
  and lets not forget that those exports are created by people who would endup unemployed edit : also if you strip away exports to eu27 that puts the remaining uk export size somewhere just above poland and below spain, 
  i just went thru each country on the mit site and copied and pasted { total exports , total exports to uk , percentage of exports to uk , total imports from uk , percentage imports from uk } http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/gbr/ http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/irl/ ... etc if you go to each page you would see very very detailed breakdowns of imports and exports , what they are , where they go etc the whole site is a treasure mine of information, 
  there are no winners in any trade war between uk <  eu27 what there will be in that scenario is 28 different shades of loser , with uk losing the most followed by ireland and then benelux countries ... 
  beats me , now if the eu27 falls apart ( may and putin now have something in common ) then they get to deal with each country on 1:1 basis then things get interesting, 
  how countries interact with each other : * they fight each other ( i sure hope you are not threatening war are you ? ), 
  * they trade with each other ( data is above clearly showing that uk has an incredibly weak position in any negotiations with eu27 ) * people from those countries travel between each other ( there are plenty of brits in eu27 and vice versa , working/retiring/studying etc ) how is the data above `` obviously biased bullshit '' ? 
  do you usually stick your fingers in your ears and sing lalala when reality presents you with something that goes against your belief . 
  i am not an expert , so its ok to listen to me :d, 
  we constantly hear claims by brexiters that uk has the upper hand in negotiations over trade ( lets ignore movement of people angle ) with eu27 i wasted some of my time and gathered trade data from http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/ into an excel spreadsheet ( see image attached above ) ** data is for 2014 measured in $ usd billions ** -------------------- conclusion : * in 2014 eu27 exports to uk totaled 374.5 billion out of 5,305 billion total exports ( 5.5 % ) * in 2014 uk exports to eu27 totaled 230.9 billion out of 472 billion total exports ( 48.9 % ) if a complete breakdown of trade were to occur then uk would lose half its exports ( imploding their economy ) while average eu state would lose 5.5 % ( recession for all ) , image above has exact % for each country . 
  one clear outlier is ireland , but we import twice the amount we export to uk , which would make for a very interesting time here ... 
  yes uk imports more from eu27 than it exports in return but as a proportion of each economy uk would be buggered the most . 
  in any negotiations each state will try to minimize damage to itself but all eu27 states will have to have a singular response to brexit . 
  tl.dr : uk is in an incredibly weak position, 
  its not terrible its good , but their whole economy remains based on primary resource extraction . 
  selling gas , oil , wheat , iron etc much much more money would be in selling iphones , banking services , and even vodka made from wheat . 
  i put it to you this way : * country of 4.6 million people , exports of $ 142 billion , resulting in gdp per capita ppp of $ 51k http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/irl/ * country of 143.5 million people ( 31x larger ) , exports of $ 449 billion ( 3x more ) , resulting in gdp per capita ppp of $ 15k ( 3.4 x smaller ) http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/rus/ above links contain breakdown of economies , complexity etc , i used gdp per capita ppp since otherwise russians would cry murder , regardless if its ppp or not my point remains ----------------------- here we have a tiny island with no natural resources , * no nuclear weapons and dickwaving in middle east * , which was asset stripped thruout history by its neighbor , somehow managing to bring prosperity to its people , when compared to the largest country in the world with 31x more people btw bumper crops here too this year due to the weather , yet it barely made the news ----------------------- above figures could be interpreted in 2 ways : 1 . 
  either russia can massively grow its economy if its stops being so adversarial and actually trades more , bringing prosperity to all its people 2 . 
  or russian politicians ( putin ) is pulling a wool over russian eyes and instead of modernizing the economy is concentrating on waving his dick around europe and middle east . 
  deflecting attention from the question of ** `` why is russian economy so small when compared to its land size , endless resources , and a large educated population '' **, 
  if the pound keeps falling in value ... also if uk goes into a tradewar they will lose half their exports ( that go to eu27 now ) well then that be a real shitshow, 
  so why did this float to top when i posted this yesterday https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56bcrs/russia_says_it_may_reopen_sovietera_military/ and it has more comments, 
  you are getting a taste of what americans got when the whole world thought they went insane and stupid under bush jr. 
  it is not fair for normal sane people of whom i am sure there are plenty left in uk aside : my best friend is british living here and he is starting to think everyone back home gone insane and goes into a rage every time the brexit topic comes up, 
  eh no thank you, 
  we have housing and public service problems too except we rightfully put the blame at the feet of our politicians and push them to do better . 
  instead of blaming all our problems on { eu , immigrants , etc etc }, 
  will you just leave already ? 
  whatever happened to that stiff british upper lip , all we get nowadays is moaning about how all your problems are eus fault , boy are you in for a surprise once you realise you were taken for a ride by tabloids, 
  members of parliament that come from same upper class schools ? 
  that answer to a monarch and could be slapped down by unelected lords ? 
  my my, 
  that 's actually a good question , both vietnam and cuba have improved their relationship with the us this year . 
  what 's in it for them ? 
   there 's very little practical reason why we ca n't trade goods with each other without the diplomatic dick waving . 
  your papers and ministers have insulted people and states in eu , specifically the poles , by repeatedly referring to them as second class citizens , somehow subpar to the superior brittish man/woman , all those racially motivated physical assaults did not help your case either . 
  here is a tip for negotiations do not insult your counterparts and seed badwill by waving your dick around and spunking all over everyone else . 
  why are you lumping eu migrants with non eu migrants ?? 
  anyways from the article you linked  some 40 per cent of the reports came from ireland 's muslim community . 
  some of the members of muslim communities here for whatever reasons do not seem to want to integrate , for that matter they do n't seem to get on with each other either that well either https://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0929/820158-longford-muslim-dispute/ the polish on the other have no problems out-drinking and out-eating us irish on nights out . 
  dropping out of the eu would not reduce the number of muslim immigrants here , most are here to work professionally in our hospitals with occasional asylum seeker mixed in . 
  speaking of hospitals nice pakistani fellas in our hospital stitched my kid up when he had an accident recently , i do n't particularly care who those guys pray to or what they do in their free time as long as they pay taxes and do n't commit crime . 
  but the same applies to everyone else regardless of race/religion ( or lack of ) no need to pick on muslims . 
  if migration from muslim countries is what bothers you , then do tell us how `` strong ties to commonwealth '' would not result in more immigrants for muslim countries to the uk ? 
  most of the muslim only `` ghettos '' you see in london etc have little to do with eu and a lot todo with empire where the sun never set , migration going back to before uk was an eu member, 
  ah sure thats what the pubs are for , dry out over a pint of black while smelling a turf fire, 
   do you honestly believe that is a majority view ? 
  now of course there are some horrible people around , but why is it so hard to understand that there may also be a concern about the volume of people arriving into the uk more then the race or nationality . 
  in ireland ? 
  the majority view would be general goodwill towards eastern european eu citizens , from talking to my close friends and colleagues the general consensus is * `` those polish are like us irish few decades ago when we used to emigrate en masse for economic reasons , they are hardworking and want a better life for themselves and their families '' * from my neighbors ( latvian ) to my colleagues ( polish , romanian ) to mechanic ( estonian ) to guys who build my home ( lithuanian ) every single one i met has been a very nice person to talk to with the very same dreams and ambitions i have : a better life for our children not only that but they were prepared to actually work for it , which is more than i can say about some of my own compatriots who are happy to live off our welfare system ( and my tax euros )  especially when this is coupled with a housing crisis and local services strained and maxed out . 
  here in ireland we have our own housing crisis , especially in dublin we do not blame it on the `` dem foreigners '' but rightly put the blame at the foot of our government and banks who have killed house building in order to make [ nama ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_asset_management_agency ) a success and `` recover '' bank balance sheets . 
  as for `` services '' we do not even have nhs like free healthcare , those suffered due to the great recession , blaming it on foreigners would be silly . 
  come to ireland its the same 5-15c and constant rain year around , all you need is a rain jacket :d,
