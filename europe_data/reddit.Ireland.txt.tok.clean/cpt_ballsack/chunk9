  jesus will just leave already , make sure the door does n't hit you on the way out . 
  read my post i clearly wrote `` viewed by ** some ** '' now obviously both of us are not equal when it comes to english language reading comprehension :d, 
  health system here is a disaster but all that aside i know plenty of british passport holders ( friends and extended family ) who lived here a long long time , have no irish passport ( tho can probably get one ) and are on welfare in some cases , work in others , get pensions , make use of public hospitals and so on . 
  all without anyone blinking an eyelid at it , yet somehow over in uk you guys throw a fucking hissy fit and think of yourselves as superior to us `` bloody '' foreigners . 
  i never thought of anyone from uk as `` different '' , its getting very annoying reading about how the opposite is not true and i am viewed by some as somehow `` subpar '' if i were to live/work in uk, 
  not here in ireland they do n't, 
  except those eu nationals are mostly in employment unlike the brits who are mostly retired and are often a drain on various welfare/healthcare systems in other eu countries . 
  they are doing something right over in israel even if it meant building a big wall and replying to each attack with more power . 
  used to be a time when the news almost weekly had mentions of israel , not so anymore . 
  yeh race week soon as well its a great little town/city but then again my judgement is clouded being from here :d, 
  i think the way the whole manner was phrased and approached was rather sinister , but that 's my opinion . 
  to get back to subject at hand he got booed quite deservedly . 
  if he doesnt like it then he should resign . 
  be careful now , if you go against the grain you might find some polonium in your tea, 
  still waiting on the divorce papers ... 
  used to be uk but they went a bit loopy lately , looking for new friends now ... 
  yes same in us the dollars are thin but longer so had to get new wallet lol since it was annoying me also all the dollars being the same color/size is just damn annoying !, 
  he ( and me ) are from the next island over , everyone is welcome , party in extherian 's house :d, 
  something something un elected overlord ... god the hypocrisy and double-standards are staggering, 
  i do wonder how much putin and his kgb cronies spent on brexit funding ... you are buy a pupet in a wider geopolitical chess piece being played by a tsar with delusions of grandeur . 
  [ lol that reminds me of this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tuoo9se.jpg ), 
  everyone will be hurt by this silly brexit carry on , the question is to what degree all the different parties will lose p.s : what is easier to snap ? 
  1 straw or 27 straws bunched together ? 
  you know its rather pathetic cheering on to whom will bleed out fastest after uk blowing up a bomb at a gathering of friends . 
  no but they decided it be a great idea to come into work drunk and stab all their coworkers before slashing their own wrist, 
  imagine if your best friend burned his house and then set fire to the rest of the houses in the neighbourhood before proceeding and slitting his own wrists . 
  bitterness is not the correct word to use , everyone is going about with big lettered wtf tattoos on their heads, 
  go for it , as long as eu pay for it . 
  [ this is the `` pyrrhic '' winner here ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/16/eu-referendum-leave-supporters-trust-ordinary-common-sense-than/ )  leave supporters do n't believe the opinions of academics , economists and experienced businesspeople when it comes to the eu referendum , according to polling by yougov . 
   in an interview with sky , michael gove declared : `` i think people in this country have had enough of experts '' . 
  and it seems people - especially his own brexit supporters - agree . 
   over two thirds of leave supporters - compared to just a quarter of remainers - say it is wrong to rely too much on `` experts '' . 
  intelligent people make plans and contingencies , the leave side not only illustrated lack of intelligence they have made mockery of expert opinions and plans . 
  the question people in uk should be asking themselves and whatever elected representatives are not hiding out on the south pole `` now that the emperor has no clothes . 
  who will step up to leadership with a fucking plan '', 
   but england is an extremely densely populated country with 10 times the levels of immigration that ireland has . 
  ireland 4.09 per 1000 uk 2.54 per 1000 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_net_migration_rate uk was a focus for immigrants for a long long time , you can thank empire for that . 
  i am shocked as how racist the brits are against the poles and other eastern europeans , they are the friendliest and hardest working section of society here in ireland , and have left a positive mark on this country in last dozen years . 
  exactly there are 2 paths out of this mess i see 1 . 
  uk joins eea , it be a kick in balls for the leavers , but then again a bit of steel toed reality hitting their little brains down there would n't hurt 2 . 
  government falls apart and a new election is called with a proeu majority party/coalition elected . 
  leavers would moan that their democratic voice is being ignored yada yada, 
  source ? 
  are you mixing up with cameron resignation and replacement having to decide, 
  eu leaders can simply write a letter asking when is uk planning to leave and cc ` ing to major newspapers . 
  that would set fire under to whoever is in charge to respond or look like fools . 
  its a sad day when russia ridicules you, 
  oh dont worry [ we have plenty of guns burred around the place ] ( http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/discovery-of-forest-arms-cache-has-potentially-saved-lives-34517136.html ) but pretty please do park an aircraft carrier in thames estuary, 
  what further european integration and/or a superstate ? 
  if you check my recent comment history your would see that i do not want that either . 
  here is the rub neither does the eu there is enough issues to deal as is , since we in ireland voted on lisbon treaty ( which ironically is the treaty that gives uk an option to leave , article 50 ) there was no moves for further integration . 
  eu spent last 10 years dealing with euro crisis , then refugee crisis and now this brexit will tie it up for next 5-10 years . 
  they had ( still have ) access to the common market , the problem is that the population was told that they were paying a lot for this access via 1 . 
  350million a week to eu and 2 . 
  immigration from eu they whole leave vote was predicated on a majority believing in 1 and 2 . 
  except these points are based on bullshit . 
  raises pint !, 
  no thank you , the eu as it is now is quite fine, 
  yes china daily a tightly state controller mouthpiece for chinese political establishment . 
  do you think they would have allowed this to be put out if they did not approve ? 
  the chinese are not happy campers today since their onramp into the eu decided to harakiri themselves . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/25/britons-showed-losing-mindset-say-chinese-media-in-swipe-at-leave-vote  the vote to leave the european union meant britons were `` showing a losing mindset '' and becoming `` citizens of a nation that prefers to shut itself from the outside world '' , chinese state media said on saturday . 
  i read it and the op should have posted the source article not an opinion piece , here it is http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2016-06/24/content_25841499.htm read it and weep seeing that this is direct from state controlled chinese paper  relying on a mix of calls to patriotism , fear of unlimited immigration and suffocation by what it sees as brussels red tape and petty rules , the leave campaign , headed by the maverick former mayor of london , boris johnson , just had the edge . 
   once the flag-waving and celebrations die down , britons are going to be left wondering just what they have left themselves in for . 
   partners such as china , with whom britain is currently enjoying a `` golden age , '' according to president xi jinping and prime minister david cameron at the end of the chinese leader 's state visit last october , must be wondering what comes next . 
   one estimate currently doing the rounds is that it will take 500 british officials and 10 years to negotiate a fresh trade deal with china . 
   and then there 's the chinese investors who , according to a couple of surveys by real estate companies , were holding off on decisions to buy property in the uk . 
  he should have replied with a question `` is this the end of the uk ? '', 
  and moved on . 
  we will see , we will see ... 
  enjoy the straight bananas now :d just make sure to check with the supplier is not using slave labor or fertilizing the field with all sorts of shit . 
  but its all worth it right ? 
  those pesky regulations do nothing to keep you safe ... 
  i am irish living in ireland ( republic ) and not everyone wants or cares for a united ireland , and quite a large portion of the population distrust sinn fein and their marxist leanings ( and ira connections ) , tho unfortunately they have been gaining lately . 
  they were both authoritarian but that 's where the differences end lets check [ definition of fascism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fascism ) and compare against modern russia  fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete ** check **  they regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties ** check ** and ** check **  such a state is led by a strong leader -- such as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the governing fascist party ** check **  to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society . 
  ** check ** and ** check **  fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature , and views political violence , war , and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation ** getting the point yet ? 
  **  fascists advocate a mixed economy , with the principal goal of achieving autarky through protectionist and interventionist economic policies ** check **, 
  just do not call it `` anglo irish '' isles , pretty please, 
  no having been born and lived thru the collapse of ussr this is much worse , this and other events and proclamations coming out of that shithole lately is simply fascism . 
  my grandfather who fought in ww2 must be spinning in his grave . 
   international olympic committee ( ioc ) vice-president john coates has also branded russia 's anti-doping agency and athletics body as `` rotten to the core '' . 
  rotten to the core it does not get any more damning than that please stop trying to defend the indefensible , you know what is even more damning ? 
  russia has not responded in any way as to how the corruption and doping problems will be resolved , nothing , nada . 
  no plan has been put forward outlining how they will get out of the hole they dug for themselves . 
  instead they unleashed a wave of hysteria ranting on about `` unfairness '', 
  you know whats unfair ? 
  ** athletes who do not take drugs who have to compete against state sponsored doping dopes . 
  ** whichever way you try to spin this ( and kremlin is trying hard ) what russia has done is wrong . 
  you continue to try to point at strawmen but it wont help your cause or gain sympathy from anyone not brainwashed by the reality distortion field that is modern kremlin run media . 
  so when do you guys plan on giving parts of finland back to finland ? 
  the typical putinbot response any time a big problem is pointed at in russia is usually along the lines of '' ... but but the us/west/someoneelse does it too ... '' example : point : russia annexed crimea counterpoint : but but the us ( ignoring for a moment the us hasnt annexed iraq or afganistan and are trying the best to get the fuck out of there fast ) and so on , if you read reddit long enough you start seeing thru the standard operating responses out of the kremlins media relations handbook, 
   thank god there 's boris , a smart man with funny hair . 
  and a large offshore account padded by putin, 
  you know put a 10,000 euro bill to each person from uk trying to get irish passport by descent and we might go long way towards solving our debit crisis , btw its about 1000 euro to do vice versa now edit : some context for readers http://www.thejournal.ie/thejournal-ie-factcheck-donald-trump-brexit-irish-passports-2767102-may2016/, 
   the president will use his annual address at the st. petersburg international economic forum to call for normalizing ties between the world 's biggest energy exporter and largest trading bloc , * though he 'll stop short of offering concessions on ukraine * so what exactly does he have to offer europe if ukraine is off the table ? 
  it is sort of an elephant in the room , tho i suppose putin never thought of it as a country ... 
  the problem is that russia does not want trade ties , isolationism suits putin since he can keep blaming all of the problems russia faces on the west . 
  take the example of him banning food imports from europe and somehow russian media spun it as the evil europeans trying to starve the stoic russians ( again ), 
  myself and any friends i asked , here are threats to our peace 1 . 
  irish criminal drug gangs run from spain ( where the bosses are hiding ) operating in ireland and killing people on our streets 2 .
