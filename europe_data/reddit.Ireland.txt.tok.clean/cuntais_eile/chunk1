brexit is going to happen * just * at the 100th anniversary of the start of the war of independence . 
  the uk destroyed farms and agricultural facilities to terrorise the population into submission . 
  in this climate of nationalism , ireland will almost certainly diversify way from the uk and relations will chill . 
  ** edit : ** some more observations : first , the current pro-british governing establishment will be weakened by 2018 in the next election , irish people are ruthless with parties that seem blindly loyal to britain , and not kindly inclined to incompetent and tired ones since 2008 . 
  fg will have been in office for 7 years by this point , but they are a continuation of the neoliberal policy of the 2000s . 
  there is a very high chance that sinn fein will be in coalition by 2020 . 
  second , british immigration to ireland will become controversial in a strained economy . 
  there will be serious resentment at having to make room to protect britis from their own decisions . 
  third , british attempts at retaining connections/influence , or trying to take ireland out of the eu will create resentment and anger . 
  it 's pretty ignorant given what is being said about mexicans , albanians , and turks ; and ireland 's history . 
  demographics mean that [ support for brexit will decline fairly rapidly over the next 15 years ] ( http://imgur.com/a/llxkf ) as all those old people die off - the over 65s will decline by around 60 % -80 % . 
  i do n't think anyone will object to the uk rejoining in 2030 . 
  so the best thing to do would be to stall brexit as much as possible and then make it as `` soft '' as possible with a view to holding another referendum in 15 years time . 
  you are n't the first person to complain about `` sins of the fathers '' . 
  look what john stuart mill [ said in the house of commons in 1868  ( http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1868/mar/12/adjourned-debate )  * the irish were taught that [ negative ] feeling by englishmen . 
  england has only even professed to treat the irish people as part of the same nation with ourselves since 1800 . 
  how did we treat them before that time ? 
  i will not go into the subject of the penal laws , because it may be said that those laws affected the irish not as irish but as catholics . 
  i will only mention the manner in which they were treated merely as irish . 
  i grant that for these things , no man now living has any share of the blame ; we are all ashamed of them ; but `` the evil that men do lives after them . 
  '' * but we all know what happened later ...  break the cycle . 
  plenty of irish politicians * tried * . 
  enda kenny hosted a commemoration ceremony for british troops killed in 1916 a few months ago . 
  this being the same bunch of troops that murdered innocent people in dublin with the tacit support of the british army and government . 
  brexit is a bit of a slap in the face in that regard , to put it mildly . 
  it might sound like gloating or anglophobia to say this , but since 1921 , every such iteration tends to diminish britain 's ability to influence events here , so the problem will solve itself eventually , one way or another . 
  at some point , irish people will conclude that britain is n't really a threat . 
  for example : after brexit , the uk will roughly only account for 15 % of ireland 's exports and 20 % of its imports . 
  possibility of scottish independence and a united ireland and so on . 
  irish politicians do n't want to make decisions in case it costs them 6th preferences . 
  i regret that / u/collectiveindividual sounds harsh , but he 's fundamentally right . 
  you had british ultranationalists and security forces attacking irish people in ni less than 20 years ago . 
  britain also has a * long * history of making peace treaties here and reneging on them like darth vader . 
  there is a correspondingly long line of irish politicians who tried to be friends with the uk and got burned . 
  enda kenny is only the lastest example . 
  i could cite others , like how britain fought a brutal war to suppress irish independence in the early 1920s . 
  some `` reward '' for fighting in ww1 . 
  at some point you have to question whether hanging around with britian is a good idea at all if you are only leaving yourself open to abuse . 
  trying to take the uk back to the 1950s means that irish people will accordingly start to see you they same way they remember 1950s britain . 
  again , i know this sounds horribly mean , but why would ireland want to associate with boris johnson , nigel farage and liam fox ? 
  so she 's going ? 
  the leader of the far-right alternative for germany ( afd ) party has indicated she may stand down less than six months before national elections . 
  two months after she stood alongside marine le pen and geert wilders at what was billed as an `` alternative european summit '' , frauke petry stunned party supporters by announcing she was considering quitting politics altogether . 
  `` neither the politics nor the afd are indispensible for me , '' ms petry told tagesspiegel newsaper . 
  `` it makes sense to consider and readjust your life from time to time . 
  that 's the way i see it now after more than four years with the afd , which has demanded an enormous amount of energy and forced me to wave goodbye to a normal life . '' ms petry 's surprise comments come after a turbulent start to 2017 for the afd . 
  the party , seen as the main threat to angela merkel for most of last year , has plummetted in the opinion polls . 
  its support was down to just 7 per cent in a recent poll for the forsa institute from a high of 15 per cent last summer , and some analysts have suggested it could struggle to clear the 5 per cent threshold to win seats in parliament in september 's elections . 
  ms petry 's leadership has been rocked by infighting . 
  rivals on the extreme right of the party have long wanted to force her out , while she has been locked in a struggle to expel bj\u00f6rn h\u00f6cke , a senior party figure who called in january for germany to stop atoning for its nazi past . 
  at a recent party event ms petry was reduced to tears when she came under sustained attack from a party rival . 
  but commentators have suggested any talk of retirement may be more a veiled threat to her crtics than a concession of defeat . 
  as leader , ms petry has transformed the afd from a fringe movement to a political force to be reckoned with , and most observers agree it would struggle to win the same support without her . 
  others have suggested ms petry may be feeling the strain of fighting an election campaign and fending off her party rivals while pregnant . 
  a spokesman denied that she was considering stepping down as party leader . 
  `` frauke petry is n't thinking of retirement , she wants the afd to be successful in the elections , '' oliver lang told german television . 
  gibraltar will be thrown off a cliff for the city , if you excuse the pun . 
  in light of things like the dublin-monaghan bombings , sponsoring loyalist terrorists , or the force research unit , this could be intended as a more sinister threat than people might think . 
  do n't forget that ireland was founded by a genius politician-cum-warlord in the form of michael collins . 
  the uk is a multinational union the exact same as the eu , the soviet union , or austria-hungary . 
  it is experiencing increasing regionalism as it slowly weakens after 1918 . 
  le pen gets in , she 'll find she 's confronted with hard choices when french exporters start complaining etc. 
  firms wo n't invest in export capacity if they are n't certain of access to the eu . 
   turkey is now fully under the political control of a single individual -- and incapable of dealing with the multiple crises that it faces . 
  project syndicate potentially has a `` liberal-internationalist '' bias , but this seems intuitively correct . 
  if everything has to go through one individual , either everything slows down , or things get neglected . 
  for a country with so many balls in the air , this could be dangerous . 
  look at how thresa may is becoming increasingly overwhelmed with brexit . 
  erdogan in particular reminds me of charles haughey or bertie ahern . 
  he 's being too clever for his own good if he thinks he can `` manage '' turkey 's growing debt problems . 
  bertie'a property bubble got pricked when foreign capital dried up , and the irish state and political class had become completely rotten under haughey . 
  ** you ** choose of your free will to enter in this discussion : ** you ** replied to me , and ** you ** choose to ping me in this subthread . 
  if you do n't like what i say , then nobody is forcing you to talk to me . 
  it 's not my problem in particular if you do n't like it if i refuse to observe 24 hours silence because of an attack that killed four people in another country . 
  how many are dying in yemen because of british supplied weapons ? 
  stop being so egotistical and demanding that irish people drop what they 're doing and come running when something bad happens in your country . 
  my interest in brexit was motivated by my interest in history and econometrics . 
  that said , you [ plural ] voted to do considerable damage to the irish economy , and to support a government that wants to subvert my country 's independence and autonomy . 
  you voted for the nasty ultranationalism . 
  so why should i care ? 
  it will be great not having to worry in the slightest about the uk sponsoring loyalist militias that plant bombs or slit people 's throats isis-style . 
  having to indulge that `` kulture '' in case they start rioting or killing with implicit support from london . 
  it will be great not having to listen to requests/demands that ireland join the commonwealth , or show more respect to queen elizabeth , or apologise for seceding . 
  it will great not having to put up with your obsession with being a great power and `` sovereignty '' , which in practice seems to include the freedom to be as cruel , condescending , and obnoxious to irish people as you like . 
  i said : * `` why should i let others censor what i say '' \u2194 `` stop trying to distract from the point '' * `` compassion ? 
  what has england done ... '' \u2194 '' [ fuck off ] and stop trying to guilt trip me '' i admit my recollection wasnt entirely perfect , but it was n't that far off . 
  believe it or not , i 'm telling the truth when i say i 'm generally not bothered about these kinds of debates . 
  where did i say i had no compassion ? 
  i said was n't going to indulge efforts on your part to use the deaths to guilt trip me on it or to distract from the point . 
  tha ira in all it 's incarnations was a sinister organisation . 
  michael collins was just as ruthless as martin mcguinness . 
  as a matter of fact , he was the leader of the irb , an organisation that that explicitly used no-warning bombs against civilians . 
  he avoided such tactics himself purely to avoid inflaming british opinion , like the chechens did with the russians . 
  ** all you have to do is come up with a * plausible * counterfactual , and you have n't done it . 
  okey dokey :  which totally justifies attacking civilians that were n't involved 2 or 3 generations later , right ? 
  as i said , the gfa was signed in 1998 , which generations are you talking about ? 
   brits that want them back or want to force them back are just ignorant , vast majority are n't malicious . 
  forcing people is just `` ignorance '' and not `` malicious '' ? 
  how would you like to be on the receiving end ? 
  you actually think there is nothing inherently morally wrong with using force against irish people to usurp their right to self-determination ?
