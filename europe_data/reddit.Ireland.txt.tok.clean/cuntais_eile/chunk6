  if the front national think a company is only obeying the letter of the french tax code instead of the spirit , they 'll just pass a law forcing the company to hand over what it should have owed with a penalty . 
  if marine le pen gets in , her economic policy will be a combination of hugo chavez and hitler . 
   ** banking and monetary system : **  * restore a national currency to face `` unfair competition ''  * scrap the 1973 law that secures independence of the bank of france  * allow the bank of france to directly fund the treasury  * restore `` monetary , legislative , territorial and economic sovereignty ''  * cut interest rates on loans and banking overdrafts for companies and households  * scrap eu regulation that freezes or bans the withdrawal of deposits ( life insurance and savings ) in case of a financial crisis or bank run o_o, 
  or introduce instant runoff voting and the single transferable vote . 
  `` baseless '' is a very strong word to use . 
  where are these extra resources going to come from ? 
  how is theresa may going to convince mps to vote for an increase of # x billion a year for the next * 15 years * in the military budget so the uk can go on yet another adventure ? 
  not only are british business being asked to pay money towards a stupid war , but they have to deal with the risk of bombs . 
  ordinary people get to see their local hospital closed down and watch people come home in bodybags . 
  scotland is potentially out the door by this point , and will take whatever resources it has with it . 
  the military is facing cuts in real terms going forward . 
  sterling has dropped 15 % , making all those f-35s more expensive , the uk is facing reduced growth , so more economising will be necessary . 
  the uk will have to increase its defence budget as percent of gdp just to retain its current capability . 
  on top of that `` increase '' , do you think tm will have the political capital to ask for * more * ? 
  i implicitly touched on the question of whether or not the uk would have the political will to bear the cost of starting a conflict with my remark about `` and what of scotland or wales ? ... '' . 
  for the purposes of assuring / u/collectiveindividual that the uk is n't secretly hoping for a rerun of the troubles , my comment is adequate . 
  a lot of the hard-tory right were opposed to the gfa and felt the ira could have been beaten . 
  / u/collectiveindividual was wondering if they deliberately wanted to provoke a rematch so they could win , or rally the british population with patriotism . 
  like how the troubles was a rerun of the anglo-irish war in some ways . 
  i was pointing out that they likely would n't - it would cause no end of trouble , cost a lot of resources and money , and they 'd probably end up with a worse deal than the gfa . 
  that said , the tories were stupid enough to hold a vote on brexit without any plan on what to do next . 
  we ca n't forget the mess in iraq either , where donald rumsfeld did n't send in enough troops for the post-invasion stage to save money . 
  ok , but i 'm not suggesting that eu nationals be treated * less favourably * than brits , i 'm proposing they should be treated * equally * to brits . 
  or equivalently , that brits be given the exact same rights to access the irish labour market as eu nationals . 
   ok , in a job offer situation it 's eu nationals first . 
  uk citizens with a right to reside in ireland under pre-eu laws can apply but they go on a secondary list . 
  that 's stronger than `` first they have to treat equally all eu citizens and also they can not treat eu citizens less favourably than they would treat foreign citizens '' . 
  where does this rule come from ? 
  i looked at the irish times article linked to in your previous comment , and there ` sno reference to it . 
  it is n't even obvious that the british could retain their current position if they tried again . 
  [ the british army is down to 80,000 troops ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/02/army-shrinks-below-80000-as-recruitment-struggles/ ) , around 10,000 to 15,000 were needed for ni . 
  the catholic population has increased by 25 % in the meantime , and the psni is filled with catholics . 
  so long as * an nua ira * managed to not alienate local inhabitants of ni , it 'd be difficult to root out , just like the taliban . 
  remember that the uk needs these men for other things , like dealing with isis in mainland britain or fighting russia . 
  the brits [ literally ca n't spare a division ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/british-army-russia-putin-budget-cuts-experts-warn-could-be-destroyed-afternoon-a7539971.html ) :  `` the prospect of ` losing the division in an afternoon ' will weigh heavily on the chain of command , with strategic-to-tactical command compression almost inevitable as politicians appreciate the stakes involved in committing the division to battle . '', 
  a division being around 10,000-20 ,000 troops . 
  as i said , isis would likely take advantage of the opening produced by all of the uk 's energy concentrating on ni . 
  and what of scotland or wales ? 
  they would be far more inclined to secede if london started an another war in ni . 
  reigniting the troubles sounds like a recipe for humiliation . 
  i 'm not talking about conferring citizenship , i 'm suggesting they retain their current rights , assuming the uk reciprocates . 
  how does that violate `` first they have to treat equally all eu citizens and also they can not treat eu citizens less favourably than they would treat foreign citizens '' ? 
   i 've heard davis , the brexit white paper author , talk of the cta as a freedom to work agreement when it 's really a non-binding floating arrangement and has nothing to do with the right to work in each nation . 
  he 's a bit ignorant , but informal arrangements have a way of lasting when it comes to the uk . 
  i do n't see why british still ca n't work here . 
   unlike the talk about brits in spain and other eu nations , so far i have n't heard the brexit cabinet actual understand that their citizens in the irish republic , of which there 's 300.000 , wo n't have free access to our eu job market . 
  [ i still think you 're overestimating the likelihood of dublin denying british citizens employment rights . 
  ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5qu8hk/most_common_country_of_origin_of_foreignborn/dd3fh33/ ) again , i 'm not sure why ireland wo n't just pass a law saying that uk citizens are entitled to the same rights as like eu citizens , like the 1949 act in reverse , avoiding any issues with eu citizens getting treated unfairly . 
   *** 4.7 ***  both the uk and irish governments have set out their desire to protect this reciprocal treatment of each other 's nationals once the uk has left the eu . 
  in particular , in recognition of their importance in the belfast agreement , the people of northern ireland will continue to be able to identify themselves as british or irish , or both , and to hold citizenship accordingly . 
  does n't sound arrogant to me , more a simple statement of both countries ' positions . 
  is that an admission that the british started it lol, 
  read my very first comment . 
  i was n't asking for an apology , i used quotations to show that i was actually referring to your somewhat mealy-mouthed comment : `` what happened should n't of happened , but it did and hopefully we 'll learn by our mistakes . '', 
  i was remarking on your `` non-apology apology '' and the fact that most of what you just said was irrelevant . 
  there 's also the use of the word `` hopefully '', 
  what is he going to offer ? 
   who are you ? 
  honestly , ireland has quite a traitorous and dirty history . 
   do n't act like saints . 
  lots of us have said what our government has done in the past , but if you think i 'm going to feel guilty , or admit guilt for something i had no control in - think again . 
   the ira killed , maimed , raped , burnt and abused many innocent people . 
  peddled drugs , snitched on their own . 
   i do n't feel guilty for the past . 
  ... . .  anything to avoid discussing the actual facts . 
   * more * evasiveness . 
   you harbour hate for people that are no longer in power , or who are dead . 
  or just believes in promoting the truth . 
  first you accuse him of trolling , now you 're engaging in speculation about his motives . 
  anything to avoid discussing the actual facts . 
   what happened should n't of happened , but it did and hopefully we 'll learn by our mistakes . 
  they were n't mistakes , they were crimes committed over several decades by your elected governments . 
  * more * evasiveness . 
  what does `` hopefully '' mean in this context ? 
  british soldiers might still kill innocent people ? 
   remember your history , but do n't let it fester and twist you . 
  not content with * ad hominems * , you now presume to start ordering people around . 
  who are you to tell others what to do or to claim that kind of moral high ground ? 
  it 's an accusation of hypocrisy . 
  illyrians are related to celts , no ? 
  he 's right , it 's an ad hoc convention that does n't have any formal legal component at all besides a joint visa scheme . 
  of course when it comes to the uk , informal conventions can be strong , but they 're still informal . 
  the british have form when it comes to expressing mildly irredentist attitudes towards roi , and they 've been fairly rude about brexit . 
  imagine if russia published a similar paper and excluded estonia from the list of eu nationals ? 
  they have a fairly unique relationship after all , do n't they ? 
  all it 'll do is inflame nationalist sentiment and make people think they 're living in 1917 . 
  le pen has to reassure the middle ground that she wo n't be a corrupt and dishonest idiot as soon as she gets into office like nigel farage , donald trump or boris johnson . 
  this is n't helping . 
  once you get a reputation for corruption , the media will chase after you as well and pick you apart . 
  it was the tories who signed the uk up for those liabilities and arrangements as well - how could anyone take theresa may seriously after she screwed her previous partners over like that ? 
  however , serbia gets to live right next to a semi-failed state that is probably a haven for god only knows what . 
  they 're just hurting themselves - there 's a reason ireland put the effort into staying on good terms with northern ireland . 
  if i understand you : ireland tends have relatively weak government and had a poor agrarian economy historically ; kosovo ca n't provide any government at all , and has a nearly entirely criminal economy . 
  not just shady tax deals or `` light touch '' regulation for tech firms or the ira . 
  there , you have full on gangsterism , murder and racketeering and so on . 
  i 'm concerned about what the uk is doing * right now * . 
  i 'm not uncomfortable with the idea of wales acting as a buffer zone between ourselves and london , or an independent scotland putting an end to this `` rule britannia '' nonsense . 
  not for 5 years at the * very * earliest , but poland will get annoyed if there are british people in ireland whilst poles are discriminated against in the uk . 
  we 'll need eastern europe 's support in the eu council much more often with the uk 's votes gone , not discounting all the poles in ireland with citizenship and the indigenous anti-british vote . 
  no , but it was created in a chechnya-esque war .
