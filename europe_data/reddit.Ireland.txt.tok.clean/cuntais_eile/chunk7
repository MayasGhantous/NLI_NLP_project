  leading to the country being a semi-basket case with the ira still active until the 1940s , and one of the much better leaders [ sean lemass ] being an assassin before he went into politics . 
  ireland managed to pull together after being created in similar circumstances . 
  where else can you go ? 
  there 's nothing wrong with a good relationship , but the uk would be entirely dependent on the us without the eu . 
  would it not be simpler and more stable for france to use instant runoff voting like ireland ? 
  look at the [ 2011 presidential election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_presidential_election,_2011#results ) , the hard-nationalist candidate , martin mcguinness , just got filtered out in one of the earlier rounds . 
  i do n't understand your comment , you ca n't be responsible if you do n't first have choices to be responsible for . 
  habits take a few generations to die out . 
   you seem to have an obsessions with britain and ni . 
  i already said these conflicts are irrelevant . 
   join the ira already then , leave us alone . 
  stalking through my internet history looking for things to discredit me with ? 
  or intimidate me ? 
  you 're the one who replied to * my * comment , stop trying to fob me off as some kind of obsessive , or portray yourself as an innocent victim of some fanatical fixation . 
  actually address what i wrote instead of baldly asserting that i 'm wrong . 
  edit : look at * your * comment history , i knew you were projecting lol . 
  ni had a better quality of life than roi during the troubles , notwithstanding the violence . 
  i could easily imagine a british person producing such a video in the 1980s . 
  i 'm not sure you appreciate what it 's like being in the palestinian 's situation . 
  it took nearly a century of independence from the british rule for irish people to * start * showing any signs of the responsibility and maturity you described . 
  french business will be happy . 
  * 2/3rds * of the us senate would need to approve the deal . 
  it was the uk who unconditionally indulged unionism up until 1985 out of anti-catholic prejudice . 
  london ensured that ni would find it hard to work under the usual rule of law . 
  ireland was allied with the rsfsr in the early 1920s . 
  just walk away and do n't let it hurt you . 
  extract from a comment i posted last month : * women were the property of their husbands : `` a wife was regarded as a chattel , just as a thoroughbred mare or cow '' . 
  was n't repealed until 1981 . 
  * if a husband and wife shared a passport , he could travel on it alone , while his wife could only do so with his permission . 
  * contraceptives were illegal until 1978 . 
  the law was not liberalised entirely until 1993 or so . 
  * only country in europe to practice anything resembling fgm , women got their vaginas sawed open instead of c-sections so they could have more babies . 
  * up until the mid 1990s , `` fallen '' women , or women who offended the community could be locked away in the magdalene laundries . 
  * a women died in hospital because she was refused an abortion ... actually that was in 2012 `` sive '' by john b keane [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sive_ ( play ) ] is a tragic play i studied in school about forced marriage in ireland . 
  you had all this stuff to a milder degree in ireland up until 30 years ago when the country gradually liberalised . 
  france and germany both have a geopolitical imperative to keep ireland sweet in order to reduce meddling in the continent from the atlantic . 
  the uk is n't going to turn down a reasonable fta in goods . 
  `` the project '' would be best served by ensuring that ireland does well without the uk so that everyone would see clearly the difference that eu membership makes . 
  accrodingly , i 'd say they 'll put up with the uk 's crap as much as possible and offer a vanila fta on the way out without any `` bespoke '' privileges . 
   kla would be a problem , but they would surely calm down , and it wouldnt be `` decades to come '' . 
  seems the eu is running into the same problems as the soviet union and is having to introduce an internal passport system . 
  that 's how the eu is going to avoid dealing with the issue . 
  the countries never completely fused , certain institutions like the church remained in scotland , and provided the nucleus for the country 's reemergence . 
  demographics will soften unionism over time , they 're already starting to sound more like lord middleton or edward carson , and less like ian paisley . 
  it would also leave a hole in the organic laws for wales and scotland . 
  hm 's loyal subjects will happily rebel violently against the crown if it suits them . 
  hm 's loyal subjects have the most to lose of all in case the nascent nationalist majority says `` fuck this '' , and votes ni out of existence . 
  the aggressive form of irish nationalism known as `` physical force republicanism '' does n't seem to have seriously taken root in ni until the troubles . 
  the ipp were traditionally strong in the north , as shown by how long it took for sinn fein to eclipse the sdlp . 
  not as of now due to demographics , and the question of an independent ulster would tear unionism in half . 
  it 's more a rentier and authoritarian mentality in the country 's elites - taking wealth rather than making it combined with dislike of civil society and cap-doffing . 
  sturgeon can always employ salami tactics . 
  interesting that spain recognises ireland . 
  that 's only if the mosques ' staff have diplomatic immunity , which is unlikely . 
  how are you going to find alternative markets to germany on your own ? 
  a social liberal party . 
   in ** 22 years ** you have n't learned that acting superior is not the way you get people on your side . 
  you are n't familiar with british-irish history i see ... 
  the possibility that everyone else elects non-globalist governments is the real worry if you export . 
  renzi should have made it so that the change would n't take effect until after the next general election was held , and then said a new election would be held as soon as reasonably possible no matter what the outcome . 
  that 's different , calais is `` pre-clearance '' . 
  this seems to suggest the uk wants control of ireland 's * actual borders * and decide who can and ca n't enter . 
  i actually have no idea what this means . 
  you ca n't just impose border controls on another sovereign state . 
  i was just pointing out that this `` right-wing '' stuff is simply not viable in ireland . 
  identity ireland , renua ireland , and direct demicracy ireland , are all minuscule - antifa ca n't be blamed for their crappy results in the polls . 
  but as you note yourself , this whole rightwing thing is pretty unprecedented in ireland . 
   hates muslims , gypsies ( of any kind ) and probably also blacks . 
  how many polish people know that irish people were a nation of nomads , raiders , pirates and so on ? 
  or that we 're traditionally friendly with arabs ? 
  or that irish people had to put up with a considerable amount of ethnic discrimination in the past ? 
   you also have the same kinds of nationalist , neo-nazi , or whatever you want to call them , groups . 
  i think you just give them less airtime . 
  most of their supporter are from among the lower classes , which is important to keep in mind . 
  our ultranationalists are leftwing anti-colonial ones , and they are doing well in the polls . 
  did you know gerry adams had people killed and fought a 30 year guerilla war against the british ? 
  this nazi racist thing is truly alien , i honestly do n't get how slavs can support that stuff given how the germans treated everyone in the east . 
  that said , ukrainian nationalism and irish nationalism seem somewhat similar and irish republicans are known to be cordial towards germany historically . 
  that is n't going to happen - we 're experts at the babies game lol , and will just see it coming . 
  he just thinks irish kids should be able to learn polish as a second language in school ? 
  i 'm assuming that he wants it to be taught as a second level language like french or german . 
  not trying to colonise the place like erdogan and his comments in germany about assimilation being evil . 
  concerning your fifth point , interdependence can actually create friction if it is n't managed properly - look at japan and the us in 1930s . 
  the eu also ensures that such links ca n't be used by eu states to coerce each other , tempting the losers to start using their armies . 
  ** summary : ** * the surprise showing of national front candidate jean-marie le pen in the first round of french presidential elections poses a profound challenge to the idea of a transnational europe : a europe without borders and a europe of citizenship separated from nationality . 
  the hard-right parties will not win the presidency , but if a group of essentially fascist parties can win 20 percent of the vote in a time of relative prosperity , what will happen when times get tough ? 
  * * a deep-seated unease has emerged in france and the rest of europe about the decline of the nation . 
  since no centrist party wishes to speak to this issue , and since the left has failed miserably in dealing with it , the far right -- by default -- is becoming legitimized as the only political force that will address the concerns of europeans who fear the consequences of europeanism and an american concept of citizenship . 
  * ** analysis : ** the surprise of the french presidential elections on april 21 is not how well national front candidate jean-marie le pen did . 
  le pen , who now faces a runoff with incumbent president jacques chirac on may 5 , was nearly as successful in the last election . 
  there were , however , three real surprises in the vote . 
  the first is how fragmented the french political system has become : almost half of the voters cast ballots for someone other than chirac , prime minister lionel jospin or le pen . 
  the second surprise was how badly the left did . 
  le pen and the other hard right-wing parties were essentially tied with the socialists and communists . 
  that represents a profound collapse of the french left . 
  finally , there is the surprise that le pen , who has been seeking the presidency since 1974 , has not gone away . 
  even with relative prosperity and peace , the deep passions that le pen taps into remain . 
  you can get a sense of the roots of the situation by considering the geography of the election . 
  jospin carried only one province , midi-pyrennees , le pen swept the entire mediterranean coast and the eastern border of france and chirac took the remainder of the country . 
  there is great significance in this geography .
