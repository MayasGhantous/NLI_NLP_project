[ well there were reports of him having cancer .

  well judging by the content and quality of the pics in them , they are so porn worthy as in shit looks so cool . . 
  i do n't know , it 's something around lines of that ... or who knows , there are people who wank it to pics of clouds and mountains . 
  its just like / r/skyporn or / r/earthporn just pictures of beautiful cemeteries . 
  nothing pornographic . 
  judging from what you 've posted , i 'm guessing you are in north india ? . 
  norway has some breathtaking scenaries, 
  i agree with one of the comments in article , why not use that money to build cheaper , efficient housing ? . 
  buying the castle is one thing , maintaining that is going to cost them a lot more . 
  `` know that if you are not with us , then by definition , you are against us . '', 
  you 've got great taste in music < 3 on topic : [ jenni vartiainen - suru on kunniavieras ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ljjeg6rtzs ) [ routasielu - kaipaus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a30wxbmw9ay ) [ arttu wiskari - m\u00f6kkitie ] ( http://youtu.be/t4ml7n4r5yk ) [ pariisin kev\u00e4t - mielikuvituksen tuotetta ] ( http://youtu.be/rzpw9gotd5y ) [ jesse kaikuranta - viel\u00e4 t\u00e4\u00e4ll\u00e4 ] ( http://youtu.be/iiywgkcene8 ) [ egotrippi - matkustaja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa0zkzji7e0 ) [ laura n\u00e4rhi - hetken tie on kevyt ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0i1_pyfikc ) i ca n't get enough of finnish music :d, 
  tbh op had multicultural in quotes , so i was n't sure what to expect from this thread xd, 
  that 's a character from the tv show moomin and no she 's not shitting ... 
  my finnish friend sent me [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r5pdt0y.jpg ) that was actually good , i finished it in 2 days xd, 
  likewise , both are fairly active on the other european subreddit . 
  which if you do n't know is a safe heaven for neo-nazis/white rights idiots, 
  well to be fair , / u/vondi might know him . 
  it 's not like asking an indian `` hey , i know this guy raj from india , do you know him ? '', 
  also , there has been reports of isis capturing those who wants to return . 
  i love you guys < 3, 
  it 's ok i 'll visit you , actually i 'm coming there for christmas !, 
  yer a good cunt !, 
  it 's simple really . 
  if you have beard : speak finnish else : speak swedish, 
  aye , if talking about annual salary then it 's always pre-tax . 
  when talking about monthly , no one i know gives the exact , they say a range for eg : around 3 grand !, 
  so that 's how clouds are made !, 
  met a good few of them in ireland . 
  iirc vice sends muslim journalists for these kinda things . 
  [ here is the link where he suggested that ] ( http://www.channel4.com/news/radical-british-muslims-islamic-state-caliphate-iraq-syria ), 
  dunno if you missed another article , the dude in the white is willing to renounce british citizenship , so he can move to iraq . 
   caliphobia whoa that did n't take long , is that the trend these days ? . 
  adding phobia at the end to make people guilty of criticizing psychotic shit ? . 
  ahh , thanks for clearing that out !, 
  i like how she politely said `` if you do n't like it , then you can fuck off '' . 
  at least i hope that 's what she meant xd, 
  i thought he was talking about interracial marriage ? 
  except we keep them in our parliament , right lads ? 
  this is hands down ** one ** of the tragic things that happened here , we really need to change our stone age laws . 
  what bothered me was after her death , the pro-choice community really milked this incident , to a point she was no longer a person and some sort of trophy for the pro-choice community . 
  that just pissed me off . 
  that is a good cause , i 'm in !, 
  [ yup , they sure did !, 
  hey , me too !, 
  the best part ? 
  he embraces it !, 
  haha was in joensuu in february , the apartments kinda reminded me of noljakka :d i like joensuu , nice place !, 
  expensive for poor tourists , i heard if you live and work there , then it 's not so bad ... 
  is that noljakka joensuu ? 
  fucking love kerry !, 
  there is a gay russian neo nazi group , i ca n't link their flag right now cause i 'm at work .

  i 'll buy lots of m\u00e4mmi , i love that thing !, 
  finnish 101, 
  see , i knew i did the right thing , when i learned finnish cursing instead of actual finnish ... 
  i understood more than 70 % of what was going on there . . 
   what the fuck is arranged marriage and what is the point in it the main reason for arranged marriage is money , family status and religion . 
  race or `` sticking to the same kind '' has nothing to do with it . 
  india is one of the countries with highest rate of arranged marriage and there are known cases of ** interracial ** arranged marriages in india . 
  likewise , finland is awesome . 
  i love russell peters , the man is fucking awesome !, 
  i go there as well , it 's great . 
  most of them there have n't left their basement , have no clue about outside world and just likes to blame everything on jews and black people . 
  never knew where they got this black = different species bullshit . 
  i was hoping you 'd be one of the mods :(, 
  you hangout with nazis ? ... 
  [ i love his take on tony abbott ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3iakvmkxuk ), 
  cheers mate , 
  is there a link to the full episode ? . 
  [ they found 4 of them ] ( http://www.thelocal.dk/20140713/four-of-the-11-missing-indian-boys-found-in-copenhagen ), 
   indian-speakers indian is n't a language bro , the language you speak in india depends on where you are from . 
  the country has around 22 official languages and over a 1000 languages . 
  [ i 'm looking forward to the wc 2018 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wowowqbctbq ), 
  jaysus , i missed that little detail ... 
  i mean it 's a great phrase and can be used ( almost ) anywhere , for eg : we can even build an abortion clinic and name it `` ah sure it 'll be grand '' and it 'll make perfect sense !, 
  the sun radiation ( or whatever that is called ) is quite bad here , so no wonder why yours is bad . 
  compared to uk ? 
  nahh , it rains a lot and you can never say how long the sun will last , right now as i type this it 's pretty sunny out , about 20 mins ago it was raining like hell xd, 
  i do n't think there were any major hostility towards indians in canada , atleast nothing i can remember . 
  yeah lots of people hate english/french/dutch / portuguese because of the colonialism . 
   also , you 're the second irish-indian i 've seen here this month . 
  i had no idea you guys even existed . 
  haha really ? . 
  i have n't met any irish-indian in person . 
  most of them stay away from indian communities , because you know people who marry non-indians are treated like an outcast among indians xd we had lots of indians in ireland , most of them left because ( believe it or not ) , they did n't like the weather . 
  i heard lots of them left to australia because it 's a lot more like india when it comes to weather :d, 
   the only people who get a ( somewhat ) free pass are canadians ( no idea why ) canada is the extension of punjab , that 's why :d  some indians think they were hitler 's chosen people ( some indians are pretty proud of `` muh aryan heritage '' ) . 
  ahh of course but most of them forget that hitler hated india , he believed the descendants of indo-aryans were n't pure blah blah blah . 
  i know indians who consider mein kampf like it 's a scared text and the fact that nazi used swastika ( which is an ancient hindu symbol ) means he must have loved us indians very much ! . 
  irish-indian here , you hit the nail on indian mentality . 
   the ceo of microsoft is indian . 
  by 2030 all ceos will be indian because intelligence is an indian trait . 
  every time someone who is one way or another related to india becomes a ceo or does something amazing , every india media portrays him/her as a indian hero . 
  even if the person was born in usa . 
  on the other hand if the same person commits a crime ? 
  nahhh he 's american , he 's not indian at alllll , he looks brown cos he got tanned !, 
  i stayed in malaysia for a month due to my job . 
  i really liked it , it 's very diverse , you got chinese , indians , malays , singaporeans , koreans , americans , irish , brits . 
  heck i even met people from finland .
