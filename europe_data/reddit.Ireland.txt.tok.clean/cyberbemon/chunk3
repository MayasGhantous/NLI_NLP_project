  according to my finnish friend , most of the students lack motivation , i do n't think adding pressure into the education will give them that motivation , if anything they 'll probably never show up ! . 
   finland can join us being that they are also asian no voi vittu !, 
  finns are not asian , the [ asian looking finn has sami genes ... ] ( http://myrtlestreet.blogspot.ie/2011/05/are-finnish-people-asian.html ), 
   that they could not find an irish or eu citizen to fill the position ahh , forgot about that thing ! . 
  thanks for clearing that up !, 
  i 've heard some companies wo n't hire you , if you require work permit ? . 
  saw plenty of that when looking for jobs after college . 
  well , i was n't talking about us in particular . 
  let 's say there is some rich guy in middle east or an asian country , that is about to get his ass kicked for something . 
  there are countries where he can gain entry if he has a certain amount of money , it 's basically showing , i can take care of myself and wo n't be a burden to your country ! . 
  this is based on what i 've heard though , i could be wrong ! . 
  not sure if it 's the same , but i 've heard , if you have above a certain amount of money in your bank ( we are talking millions here ! ), 
  some countries will let speed up your visa application or something like that . 
  water 's back in dublin ! ... 
  yeah , i watch it for the plot !, 
  i do n't know what the fuck it 's updating , shit looks the same to me !, 
  they are the best thing in the world . 
  i look forward to spending my time in sauna after a long day of work !!,

  tak !, 
  yeah , i was actually surprised by that ! . 
  i mean the british was in india for quite a long time and according to [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-indian ) wiki article , there are about 300,000 - 1 million anglo indians in india , anyone know why this was n't included in the graph ? . 
  no stains left in india , eh ? .

  yeah i 'm surprised he did n't switch to pc ** masterrace ** ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  i thought jyvaskyla was a big enough town ? 
  my finnish friends in tampere have also said these guys have caused trouble there before . 
  honestly the norwegian prison system is absolutely mind blowing . 
  similar thing mentioned in bible as well  matthew 18:20 : ** for where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am i in the midst of them . 
  make them russian muslims ...

  and the casual yes , `` joo '', 
  good shit though !, 
  [ you missed the most popular one !,

  i agree , there is going to be a good majority that are going to be very vocal about this . 
  i think we need sort out our issues first , before we start taking in more immigrants , else this will cause more tensions . 
  aksdjfiwhlkajalska did i do it right ? 
  quickly ! , throw bottles of vodka at it until it calms down !, 
  everyone knows iceland is made up and does n't exist !, 
  common to an extent among older folks , something you do when you meet someone at a mass or something . 
  young people do n't really do that , some hug , the rest goes for a handshake . 
   i visited ireland and the u.k. 
  sorry where were you in ireland ? 
  i 'm just curious :d, 
  galway has good public transport , there are tourist buses to castles . 
  you can also use the intercity service , get the one day tickets . 
  last i checked it was 4.50 you can then use the ticket for whole day and travel as much you want . 
  `` few migrants land in europe , you 'll never guess what happens next '', 
  finland . 
  finland is my go to place for holidays , i 've only visited finland during winter , but i 'll be there this summer . 
  * it 's very quiet ( country side ) . 
  * i ca n't get enough of finnish food !, 
  * i love walking in the woods , its one of my fav thing to do when i go there . 
  * some people find the dark cold winter depressing , i fucking love it . 
  better than the fucking weather here . 
  * karjalanpiirakka * joulutorttu * and listening to finnish , i do n't speak much , but i love hearing it . 
  to be honest , if you are coming to ireland and only sees dublin , then you are n't getting much . 
  dublin is just like any big city , expensive , noisy and not that interesting . 
  if you want to see ireland , the country side is where you want to go . 
  ah the logic of an 18 year old . 
  snek is leaking !, 
  nothing a bag over the head ca n't fix ... 
  [ here is a full list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ethnic_groups_in_the_united_states_by_household_income ), 
  there was one lad in my high school , was very quiet . 
  was n't there some guy who killed a cat and jerked off on its corpse and called it art ? 
  forgot what his name was . 
  they teach it with the assumption that you already know the language . 
  learning stories and poems and then regurgitating that on to the answer sheet is not the way to teach the language . 
  they teach spanish/french/german and other languages properly , i.e as if you are going to live there and speak the language . 
  when it comes to irish `` meh , here are some stories and poems , learn em off '' . 
  english . 
  mediocre japanese ( self taught ) spanish , did this in high school for 3 years , was quite good at it . 
  but never got to use it since , so pretty shit at the moment !, 
  finnish , i love how it sounds and it 's hands down one of my fav languages . 
  i can curse like a pro in it and i can talk about some stuff ... i think . . malayalam , can speak and read it pretty well . 
  writing is shit . 
   i am a bit ashamed about this bit since it is the native tongue of my country no need to , the way they teach the language is fucking atrocious . 
  so i 'm not surprised most ca n't say anything past the basics . 
  that is to be expected when a sub gets popular , not that i approve of it . 
  the sub is very political now .
