  thousands of years have passed and in the meantime women 's rights have happened , divorce has happened , all the lovey-dovey hippie bullshit was thrown into the mix and now same-sex marriage is happening . 
  it 's the logical step forward in improving the quality of life for all citizens . 
   something so beautiful  you do n't know the slightest thing about the bible choose one . 
  simultaneously knowing the bible and finding it beautiful is a logical fallacy . 
  i can already feel the russians trembling at our might . 
  neutral gloves are coming off boys . 
  those bastards picked on eesti . 
  b\u00f6rk b\u00e5rk the younger generations wo n't fucking learn geography !, 
  that 's for my therapist and i to know and you to find out , 
  used to be an altar boy . 
  i suppose you 're just somewhat overrepresented compared to most of us due to having a higher absolute number of redditors because of your massive population . 
  my mum grew up in rural 1960s ireland , in a village not far from where most of these photos were taken . 
  they only had electricity in her parents ' bedroom , gas lamps everywhere else , and they all shat in the fields . 
  considering she grew up 50 years after these photos were taken , i 'd be surprised if many of these people realised that culinary options existed other than various servings of potato . 
  fuck standard of living , it 's all about those juicy download speeds !, 
  i 'm paying $ 45/month for 2.6 mbps and 0.35 mbps . 
  fuck everything . 
  possibly should have added a / s. 
  they 're just hellenophobic nazis . 
  you 're absolutely right , i 've only spent a few days of my life there . 
  have i missed the particularly bad estates ? 
  i saw some horses and just assumed knackers, 
  our statistics are compiled per county ( there are 26 ) rather than per city . 
  the most recent data i can find is from 2010 : the poorest county was donegal with $ 16,106 annual disposable income per capita and the richest was dublin with $ 21,515 . 
  not really large enough a discrepancy to be interesting and donegal is actually a pretty nice place . 
  the grimmest city is probably limerick , which we fondly call stab-city . 
  it used to have a reputation for drug violence and general thuggery a couple of years ago but nowadays the gang-members are mainly in prison or dead , so it 's become much safer . 
  still , its suburbs continue to provide us with national gems such as [ this estate ] ( https://www.google.ie/maps/place/delmege+park,+limerick/@52.6824453,-8.6566739,3a,75y,116.12h,82.29t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1srtfquw72rtutbyuvtfwsjq!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo1.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3drtfquw72rtutbyuvtfwsjq%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d103.07249%26pitch%3d0!7i13312!8i6656!4m2!3m1!1s0x485b5cfcbd95f169:0x47ab2de500162a27 ) and [ this one ] ( https://www.google.ie/maps/@52.6760862,-8.6276195,3a,75y,46.4h,78.07t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sxdddvs9slmdcqdsbzj9fia!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) . 
  elections are looming in ireland , it 's apparently going to be a utopia by this time next year . 
  what 's the current situation regarding same-sex marriage ? 
  i recall a big hullabaloo after we had the referendum about how italy 's gays ' time had come and how he would legislate - have n't heard anything else about it since . 
  you literally said in another comment in this very thread that some economists are predicting 7 % but that it 's more likely to be 5.5 % . 
  make up your mind . 
  [ bitch please . 
  that strawman is impressive . 
  why are irish people so embarrassing on the internet ? 
  ca n't bring ye cunts anywhere . 
  this reminds me of the [ recent ad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xckdld0om8s ) released by the northern irish tourist board . 
  charleroi 's not a part of brussels but it 's still a dangerous shithole to be fair . 
  oh , sure , sorry !, 
  it 's also important to consider varying definitions of poverty . 
  the irish criteria for living in poverty are missing one meal over a two-week period and not being able to afford a sunday roast each week . 
  hardly life-threatening . 
  neither of those are relevant to paramilitary actions in northern ireland , though ? 
  [ that was more the uda 's style . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greysteel_massacre ) seriously though , i do n't think you should underestimate the ira 's brutality . 
  many of their friendly bomb warnings served to lead civilians closer to the actual location of the bomb . 
  edit : seems the ira were also partial to a bit of [ mass shooting . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingsmill_massacre ), 
  can you give a source ? 
  not arguing , just curious . 
   the one 's that were suspected being gay , were actors , artists and singers that had it better than the common factory workers . 
  til homophobia in estonia is akin to the apparent jewish world order . 
   we do n't belive in any of the gods :d jealous !, 
  what 's this , an opportunity to be passive-aggressive and bitter ? 
  of course they are , a depressingly large amount of gay people have inferiority complexes as a direct result of people like you . 
  [ this pair ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6hd8klqbva ) , particularly that cunt manning were constantly on television leading up to the referendum , the self-loathing is palpable . 
  ah sorry , you 're right , i went looking for sources and it turns out it was just a claim made by some local historian . 
  it was hugely sensationalised at the time which i guess is why i misremembered . 
  this is why poland ca n't into central europe . 
  the imprisonment and systematic emotional and physical abuse of ` fallen ' women in institutional homes to be used as slave labour by the catholic church . 
  children born in these homes had an extremely high mortality rate due to the horrific living conditions . 
  ~ ~ a mass-grave was discovered quite recently in my county containing the remains of 800 infants . ~ ~ the last one only closed in 1996 . 
  a large number of legal discrepancies exist between civil partnerships and marriage equality so no , they 're not . 
  maybe i 'd think of a witty merkel pun if i were n't so damn high, 
  do we ? 
  i 've never paid for an atm transaction nor have i heard of it being a thing , are student accounts exempt ? 
  jobseeker 's benefit is different to [ jobseeker 's allowance ] ( http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/unemployed_people/jobseekers_allowance.html ) which everybody is entitled to and which is very much abused , both by immigrants and irish people . 
  the economy seems to be thriving despite austerity rather than as a result . 
   uk , au , nz , cn , or the us ( the ` english speaking world ' ) :'(, 
  sadly i think you 're right . 
  ideally we would have a referendum as soon as possible but i fear that without a much more strategic and wider reaching campaign than that of the marriage equality referendum , it 'd struggle to pass . 
  nah , ireland was the first country to implement a smoking ban in workplaces . 
  smoking is also forbidden on public hospital campuses and certain university campuses . 
  agreed . 
  a huge proportion of older people who supported marriage equality do not support abortion . 
  it 's an extra $ 0.40 here to get water with a mcds meal instead of a carbonated drink . 
  stop excluding us on our own thread , the irish are sheep shaggers too . 
  yeah i do n't get why killarney gets all the praise , we need to market moyross as a tourist area, 
  i probably should have used the word prejudice rather than discrimination . 
  i 'm somewhat wary of non-westernised muslims as i fear a potentially violent response if they were to find out , but in practice i would n't actively discriminate . 
  gay here , still trying to reconcile my inherent contempt for discrimination with the reality that a relatively large proportion of them would gladly see me executed . 
  have they given any indication as to when it will take place ? 
  how do you reckon the outcome will be ? 
  if you 've looked at the available literature and have disregarded the findings and made an opposing decision due to finding it icky then you 're an idiot . 
  why should everyone have to live according to your values ? 
  stop corrupting cute and pure little eesti :'(, 
  why do n't you think same-sex couples can provide a loving , healthy environment to raise children ? 
  your claims are inconsistent with the overwhelming majority of research which does not suggest any notable difference between children raised by same-sex couples and those raised by heterosexual couples . 
  also , since when has it * always * been one man and one woman ? 
  homosexuality was widely practised and accepted by the ancient celts and same-sex marriages are confirmed to have been performed in medieval ireland . 
  while we are very liberal towards gay people and the rights they should be afforded , many irish people are quite staunchly anti-abortion and it 's a debate that generally brings with it lots of emotional mud-slinging and outright lying . 
  a referendum would be necessary to change our current abortion legislation and unfortunately i do not believe it would pass . 
  can \u00c9ire into nordic now ? 
  yeah , because germany is such a bastion of secularism . 
   it 's almost always dry you obviously do n't live in the west . 
  if you 're from the north then you should know better than any of us why religion should not interfere with politics or state institutions . 
  if we are competent at anything it 's making crisps , thanks for recognising that . 
  nobody ever stops humming and hawing about swiss chocolate yet nobody cares about our mastery of the crisp . 
  ireland can into balkan ?
