  that fucked a lot up for us and canadian trade agreements, 
  ireland here , come on over , the water is warm . 
  is bavaria not the next catalonia ? 
  i mean fuck it we have northern ireland , count your lucky stars, 
  the uk wo n't be able to compete with ireland ireland : english speaking service based economy with access to a market of 400 + million europeans & low taxes uk : english speaking service based economy with access to a market of 50 million britons , and taxes that ca n't go groundbreakingly low without triggering recession . 
  how is ireland not included in this ? 
  i find it very hard to believe that the uk government is the most transparent in the world when they invest more money per capita into surveillance its citizens with gchq than any other nation state . 
  oh yes , coming from the uk the irony of this comment is just hilarious . 
  there is no easy answer to this . 
  we have had 20 years of peace but i could n't say for sure . 
  97.87 % of the country is covered by vodafone 3g . 
  with who ? 
  i 'd fucking love to know, 
  we have 5g test centres in dublin right now , but this is talking about roll out to the masses . 
  could n't have put it better myself , we have so much in common with the poles - love you guys . 
  it 's recognised by the entire european union as ' 5g ' under european communications . 
  that includes you too mr finland . 
  the ' 800 years ' of english rule in ireland nominally began in 1169 , when an army of english barons ( actually cambro-norman , being a mix of welsh and norman nobles ) landed in wexford and quickly captured the two hiberno-viking ports of wexford and waterford . 
  800 years you bloody imperialist, 
  invaded by the normans , vikings , welsh , english , then british . 
  fuck , i thought us irish had it bad with the invasions . 
  i 'm going to assume that you are just wholly ignorant and not intellectually challenged , but as previously explained gnp is a statistic that only takes in to account the profits of national companies , ** not ** foreign national companies - so it is unaffected by foreign multinationals . 
  irelands gnp is still one of the highest in europe , that 's gross * national * product - so the argument is , if one where to remove all the us mnc 's in the morning , while it would affect our economy , we would still remain of the richer countries in the eu , our domestic industry is our powerhouse . 
  why ? 
  i 'm sure we 'd love to have you . 
  we were still recovering from having to drive the british invasion out of ireland . 
  ireland still has one of the highest gnp 's per capita in europe . 
  gnp is a statistic that monitors only national domestic profit and excludes repatriated profits or profits of foreign nationals . 
  stick that one in your pipe and smoke it , you imperialistic moron . 
  ireland is most definitely not quite religious . 
  my source of reference for this is that i live here , and am also referring to many national polls ( irish times , rte & the times ) on the day-to-day practice of religion . 
  do you really think we would have legalised gay marriage if we were still a religious country . 
  in fact the catholic priesthood in ireland is struggling to gain numbers , church attendance rates have been exponentially falling for over 20 years . 
  do not tell me that ireland is ` the catholic country it was 30 years ago ' we were the first country to legalise gay marriage for gods sake . 
  you seem to be just making presumptions from conjecture . 
  this is n't explicitly true , ireland is more of a right-wing capitalist country than the uk is and had no issue with the working time directive . 
  i highly doubt that , it would undermine the entire european union as it is . 
  the u.k. 
  is n't even remotely as valuable to the eu as it wishes to believe . 
  the u.k. is primarily a service based economy in which close substitutes are available , it 's nearest neighbour - ireland which also speaks english , has a highly educated workforce and is also a service based economy will comfortably ensue the role of replacement , not to mention paris & frankfurt . 
  northern ireland would have to vote yes in a ` border poll ' which asks whether or not they would like to rejoin ireland , there are huge signs of increasing support being shown as of now , then if successful , ireland would vote on whether or not we would like the north to unify with us . 
  this is where it gets complicated - right now ireland is one of the strongest economies in europe , and the north of ireland would be seen as a huge economic burden ( there is little industry , and over 30 % of the population is employed by the public service ) - so in the short term it does n't seem like too great an idea ( as the citizens of the south of ireland would end up paying for much of the unification , considering this after difficult austerity following economic crisis this is n't a delightful choice ) , whether patriotic pride would outweigh economic factors we 're unsure - so the vote could go either way . 
  either way , i 'd love to see a united ireland some time in the future , even if not straight away . 
  that 's okay on the taoiseach front - most of us ca n't speak irish anyway . 
  yeah strictly come dancing & the apprentice is huge here , we also lots of irish versions of uk tv shows : irish apprentice , irish dragons den etc etc. 
  not to mention that irish-british movies are the fucking greatest thing since sliced pan - see in bruges : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvdkybnceeq overall the culture-mix is quite fascinating , i get on well with english & scottish wherever i go . 
  we have our differences at the best of time , but there 's some kind of a bond there alright . 
  is kosovo in the eu ? 
  i , for one , am pretty sure hitler would have fucked up ireland pretty good , despite our neutrality , if it was n't for the uk defeating the nazis . 
  i was a bit surprised as well . 
  everyone knows portugal . 
  i mean do you even wine bro ? 
  lads, 
  here i was thinking that 5c was fucking freezing in ireland . 
  the canary islands . 
  took a trip there once , honestly could have been in some council estate in london in the sun , jesus . 
  indeed , we had enough issues with troubles - can only imagine what it was like for you . 
  yeah british tv is the main event here , far more popular than irish tv - in fact it 's funny because us irish feel that but more assimilated to british culture because of it - so we end up knowing a lot more about the brits in day to day life than the brits know about us - because you do n't watch our tv as much etc. 
  sky is actually based in dublin now , yes british sky broadcasting , for tax reasons obviously - but sky , bt , virgin media are all available here and all pretty much the same as the uk channel-wise + a few more american channels for whatever reason . 
  same deal with shops - while uk shops are n't as big as irish ones , we still have m&s , tesco , waitrose , boots , argos etc etc - very hard to find any uk chains that are n't in ireland . 
  it 's very interesting to compare the two perspectives side by side . 
  yes the north is going to be a difficult one , the patriot inside me would love to see it reunified , but i think the general consensus , economically speaking , in the republic is that we 'd vote no to reunification , it 's just too much of an economic burden - there is n't a huge amount of industry there , so it would n't really be of any economic profit to us , and we 've just recovered from a huge financial crisis , additionally the cost of dealing with any troubles that might come about would be unforeseen . 
  haha , it 's a shame to see the relations take a bit of a turn for the not so better . 
  we 're starting to see the bitter ` two sides of the table ' effect already - a month ago nicola sturgeon came to visit to discuss brexit and the d\u00e1il - our main house of parliament refused to speak her , on the grounds that brexit talks were to be dealt with the eu as a whole , and instead she was pushed onto the seanad - our non-executive parliament . 
  only time will tell . 
  my biggest worry is not being able to use amazon.co.uk and whether or not i 'll have the english channels on my sky box, 
  belfast for donegal ? 
  not true - managed to pick up some streaky rashers in centra the other day . 
  it was like finding fucking atlantis . 
  that 's , for one , both nice and interesting to hear . 
  it 's not always been an easy relationship , but i think now in this modern time we 're closer than we 've ever been . 
  - the common travel area between roi and the u.k. will be an interesting one post-brexit , i really do hope they maintain it , but it 's also quite likely the north will reunify with us and we 'll lose that closer-common tie . 
  brexit is going to be detrimental to uk-roi relations i think - it will of course be the first time in over 900 years we wo n't be part of a political arrangement . 
  okay , i see what you 're saying , interesting to hear , cheers . 
  tell me what 's the general british perspective on anglo-irish relations going forward ? 
  - i 've heard it from the north , but not from mainland britain . 
  they already are . 
  almost as high as london . 
  the point is dublin is already a developed financial centre 18 of the top 25 financial institutions have offices here , and many us banks have eu headquarters here . 
  what games are developed in poland ? 
  - curiously . 
  very funny , but could you please collect all your drunken lost pikeys and deliver them back to lovely britannia . 
  what do you mean the occupation of ireland the british empire are two different things ? 
  the whole fucking foundations of the british empire lie with the invasion of other lands - there are only 22 countries in the world britain hasnt invaded - http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/9653497/british-have-invaded-nine-out-of-ten-countries-so-look-out-luxembourg.html, 
  i stand corrected on the scale . 
  nevertheless it was a genocide . 
  a genocide that could have been easily both prevented and remediated that resulted in the deaths of 1/4 of the population . 
  haha , in my experience cork people in general are pretty poor at irish geography outside of the main cork , dublin , galway , kerry , limerick . 
  i would have to say the same about dubliners - maybe it 's an arrogance that comes with residing in the main counties , or maybe the real capital just does n't teach geography properly . 
  english is the most pervasive injection of culture into ireland , but also one of the only ones we 're thankful for - i 'd argue if we did n't have english than we 'd probably be in the same economic situation as the eastern european countries , not one of the richest countries in the eu . 
  have to agree with the english lad , wording is a bit confusing . 
  you 're welcome to join r/ireland - pints on us , 
  i know . 
  it was a very enlightening moment . 
  thanks . 
  we could have used some of that love and consideration 800 years ago when you first invaded . 
  i though dublin and frankfurt were getting the london bankers . 
  shit .
