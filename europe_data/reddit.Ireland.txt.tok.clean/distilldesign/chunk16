  irish reunification has never really been an irish government objective [ from 1940 onwards ] as it was never seen as that likely up until recently . 
  the state claim over northern ireland was a claim based on the fact that the land was quite literally irish sovereign land obtained through illegal invasion and plantation by britain . 
  the irish support of german reunification , was quite literally out of hope and support for the german state - it was not a selfish interest . 
  bear in mind , the eu did not exist back then - it was only an economic union , so would not have had as much political influence . 
  german-irish political relations have been positive for a very long time . 
  prior to the irish war for independence , the germans attempted to send irish freedom fighters firearms & offered financial and monetary support to the fledgling state . 
  germany & usa were the main supporters of the newly formed republic of ireland . 
  as the saying goes , dublin is closer to boston & berlin than london ever was . 
  scotland , wales & gibraltar are not former members of what now is an eu state . 
  scotland , wales & gibraltar has nothing to do with northern ireland 's case . 
  the only reason this works is because of the good friday agreement . 
  donegal is in the republic, 
  it 's okay , 50 % extra free portugal . 
  why no ireland ? 
  ireland thanks for leaving us out brosef, 
  oh wow , did n't know that . 
  excuse my ignorance . 
  must visit cymru someday , get enough of your fucking tv channels here in ireland, 
  ah irish , such a beautiful language . 
  i 'd like to add that in ireland we often refer to iceland as dublin airport terminal 3 , and make use of your wonderfully cheap flights . 
  thank you fr\u00e6ndur, 
  if we can occupy england you have the full support of the irish army ( two armed ford fiestas ) [ jk - we beat them in a war before with a 1/20 the size army and we 'd do it again ], 
  `` juan , you must find your cousins and distant relatives and go on a quest to dublin , and find out what you will of their public transport systems '', 
  i have to agree here - i think england is largely blamed for the occupation of ireland , people forget scotland was a driving force behind it too - even though scotland was originally settled by the irish . 
  well , wales is n't exactly a country - it 's a principality of england . 
  poland has a lot of potential good luck and nice bread, 
  ah , the emerald isle . 
  ireland is actually an incredibly progressive country in terms of everything else [ same sex marriage , legalised injection centers ] abortion laws are such a disgrace in ireland , it 's coming to a referendum soon - i 'm sure it will be legalized with flying colours . 
  alternative perspective : you spew rubbish , lies & nationalist vomit in the hope of generating sad attention for yourself . 
  this comment makes no sense . 
  the pigs is a collective of countries hit hard by the recession . 
  ireland , a former member of the piigs is now the fastest growing economy in the eurozone for the last five years , hence , piigs having nothing to do with economic growth . 
  you ignoramus . 
  oh wait , i forgot / u/wasppoker is r/europe 's ** resident troll **, 
  not in ireland , i 've been reading the ft almost every day for over a year for free . 
  either way , that is why i pasted the text here . 
   there 's not a whole lot of difference between `` of '' and `` for '' . 
  yes , yes there is . 
   unless you meant `` war for independence '' in a more general sense . 
  you said it yourself -  * unless you meant `` war for independence '' in a more general sense . 
  * the word ** for ** was used and is correct . 
  nothing else was implied .

  ** not blocked by paywall , but here is text anyway ** brexit is a problem not only for britain but for the eu as well . 
  the british economy is as big as that of the 20 smallest member states put together . 
  so it is as if 20 of 28 countries were leaving the bloc at the same time . 
  brexit destroys the european equilibrium , rendering otiose minority rights in the european council : the lisbon treaty specifies that a blocking minority needs 35 per cent of the eu population . 
  together with the uk , the so-called `` deutschmark bloc '' ( germany , the netherlands , austria and finland ) has a population of exactly 35 per cent . 
  these are all countries in favour of free trade . 
  at the same time , the countries surrounding the mediterranean , which have traditionally been more reliant on protectionism and state intervention , have a population of 36 per cent , which is also a blocking minority . 
  the lisbon balance has been destroyed because the first block shrinks after brexit to a population share of 25 per cent , while the mediterranean countries extend theirs to 42 per cent . 
  they may now seek to turn europe into a trade fortress . 
  the erosion of minority rights requires new negotiations of the existing eu treaty , if not a notice of termination pending a change of contract by the `` free traders '' in the eu . 
  this new negotiation will not be feasible once the negotiations with the uk have been completed -- they have to be started simultaneously . 
  they should re-organise both the internal relationships within the eu and the relationship with the uk . 
  once the latter has left , there is no chance to reform the eu . 
  member states should stop promoting the idea of a `` two-speed '' europe , which is reflected in the divisions between the eurozone , the schengen area and the eu . 
  pursuing this idea further will antagonise poland , as well as denmark , sweden , the czech republic and hungary . 
  responding to brexit by giving the eurozone more state-like structures is to separate the north and east and draw a dividing line through mitteleuropa , while making the northern eurozone states paymasters of a new latin currency union . 
  the fact that france wants this two-speed approach is not surprising . 
  the division of central europe has been a central tenet of french policy since richelieu . 
  for example , emmanuel macron , the independent centrist candidate for the french presidency , proposes a joint european budget , eurobonds , common deposit insurance and common unemployment insurance . 
  the northern eurozone countries should resist these policies and opt for a generous free-trade agreement with britain instead . 
  the advantage of free trade is particularly strong when labour can not move . 
  the eu insists that free trade can only be granted in conjunction with free movement of people , but this is economic nonsense . 
  when labour can not move , the gains from trade are particularly high . 
  without free movement of people , the differences in wages between countries remain greater , and the higher these differences , the larger those in the relative prices of goods . 
  this is the basic source of gains from trade . 
  there are two models for a federation . 
  the first is characterised by strong minority rights and voluntary co-operation . 
  decisions have to be beneficial for at least some member states and do no harm to any others . 
  this model is stable because everybody wants to be part of it . 
  the second is based on majority decisions without strong minority protection . 
  in this model , decisions that benefit a majority but harm a minority will be taken even if the majority gains less than the minority loses . 
  this model creates losers who would rather leave . 
  to prevent exits there is a need for punishment , but the fear of punishment itself creates animosity and instability . 
  whatever happens , the uk will continue to be the eu 's neighbour and it is advisable to treat one 's neighbours well .

  the title literally says war ** for ** independence never once was the word ` of ' mentioned in the ` war for independence ' title until you introduced it . 
  flag at half mast above the gpo , to remember all those who lost their lives in the easter rising . 
  ** fifteen facts about the irish easter rising ** * 1 . the proclamation was signed by seven men : thomas clarke , sean mcdermott , patrick pearse , thomas macdonagh , james connolly and eamon ceannt . 
  * thomas james clarke , a proclamation signatory , was born on the isle of wight . 
  james clarke his father , was posted there as an irish sergeant in the british army . 
  thomas was raised catholic , even though his father practised under the church of ireland . 
  the family later went to live in dungannon , co. . tyrone . 
  * the first actual shot in the 1916 rising was in laois . 
  other rising 's also occurred in co.galway , enniscorthy in co.wexford and ashbourne in co.meath . 
  * the general post office , the four courts , jacob 's factory , boland 's mill , the south dublin union , st. stephens green , and the college of surgeons were all taken over successfully by members of the irb , irish volunteer force and the irish citizen army . 
  patrick pearse * during the early stages of the rising james connolly was injured , leaving patrick pearse as the highest in command . 
  * with james connolly was so seriously injured he had to be carried to his execution on a stretcher . 
  he was then tied to a chair in order to face the firing squad . 
  * the most fatalities during the easter rising took place on dublin 's mount street bridge . 
  * michael collins was present in the gpo , serving beside james connolly . 
  * women -- including countess markieviz -- played a strong part in the rebellion with over 200 members of cumann na mbhan recorded as participating in the fighting . 
  * joseph plunkett and grace gifford married eight hours before his execution at kilmainhaim goal and she donned her widow 's clothing for the rest of her life . 
  * towards the end of the rising , british troops had risen to 19,000 whilst irish republican groups had only gathered 1,600 fighters . 
  this was mainly due to the mix up of dates , as nobody was sure when the rising was to take place . 
  * beginning with `` irishmen & irishwomen '' , the proclamation of the irish republic is the only one of it 's period to mention women equally . 
  * a strategic attack by the british on the gpo resulted in a republican surrender on saturday , april 29 .
