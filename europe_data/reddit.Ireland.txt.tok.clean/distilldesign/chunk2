  and so are unionists . 
  either way they are terrorists - so do n't go blaming this on any state , both states condemn them .

  very true - although it being needed to say , ireland was n't so cozily offered a diplomatic option . 
  they could do what they did with ireland and try to keep treaty ports - but that did n't end well for the uk , started lots of attacks and a trade war . 
  have removed - had not read that part . 
  u the real mvp, 
  aye your boys triggered here, 
  there are irish people and there are british people , irish people can ale from both north and the republic , british people can ail from north . 
  * southern irish * do not exist . 
  for you see , part of geographic northern ireland [ donegal ] is part of the republic , and so , we prefer ` ireland ' ireland is the official name of the state of the republic of ireland , as recognised by both the un & the eu . 
  so do n't go putting brit names on us . 
  ireland & the boys, 
  did n't downvote you - do n't be so whingy pls, 
  no comment on your aunts balls but it 's not so simple - scotland wants to retain its own section of the royal navy - who 's to say who gets what , and who 's to say england gets to keep sovereign scottish ports ? 
  have to agree here - uk has spent more on trident than would make sense of getting rid of it . 
  england will keep the nukes at any cost . 
  lol irish culture has existed long before english or welsh culture , celtic culture , sport and languages have been around for longer than england has been a country . 
  ireland was never invaded by the romans and never fully invaded by the vikings , its more logical to say that modern english culture is more artificial than it is real , because it 's just a culmination of roman , viking and pict culture . 
  consider this : the sport of hurling and the gaelic language has been played and spoke in ireland for longer than ` england ' has existed . 
  dropped on the big britannia shaped head as a child so you were, 
  you are aware that dublin was the second city of the british empire for 600 years ? 
  i bet that 'll really rattle your nationalist bones . 
  $ 25 for bavaria if we can rename to republic of bavaria, 
  have removed my comment - it was n't very clear . 
  thanks for your reply . 
  ireland was in the customs union for a few months before the uk was . 
  other way around . 
  ireland joined first . 
  what 's your opinion on the future of cymru post-brexit ? 
  you 've made a good point here, 
  jesus christ , sometimes i think some troll invented a time machine , travelled to 1800 , picked up a few ` rule britannias empire hardliners ' and dumped them on 2017 reddit . 
  the british empire is long dead and buried my friend , the irish cast the first stone , then the americans and then the indians . 
  nationalist britannia is no more than a little country with a huge ego on europes western side . 
  viva europa, 
  this post is a blatant example of editorialisation . 
  title bears no resemblance to actual article , and alters context . 
  if scotland leaves it looks like you could be saying bye bye to the nukes untill a new port is found, 
  a once divided country , speaks out , to help unite a now divided country . 
  * in varietate concordia *, 
  it 's important to note that during the famine , the british employed more soldiers to guard food stocks and exports in ireland than were active in the entire british-held subcontinent of india, 
  as unenjoyable as ryanair can be some times it still blows my mind to think that europes biggest airline is irish . 
  do n't forget whiskey !, 
  you can think british genocide, 
  yeah trader joes is exactly it . 
  i think it pitches to the market as well though - i mean the standard of living is much higher in areas where aldi sued located in comparison to aldi north locates . 
  e.g ) standard of living is considerably higher in ireland than eastern europe, 
  i 've always find aldi sued - in ireland to be much more upmarket / of higher quality than aldi nord say in portugal / spain / france etc, 
  ah jaysus i hope it does n't wuppenfall, 
  very pretty . 
  * ode to joy * intensifies, 
  throw in a few little britains here and there it 's all g. viva la republique, 
  lol ` colonies ' ca n't even hold it together in the mainland ; - scotland heading out the gap - norn iron running home - commonwealth saying no thanks , we prefer trading with europe, 
  bolla berlin , pastel de n\u00e3ta & a slice of gibraltor , por favor . 
  you sir/madam , are correct , apologies , fat fingers . 
  the national motto of ireland is ** ` an bhfuil cead agaim dul go dt\u00ed an leathrais ' ** which directly translated means ` this nation will remain the land of the free , only so long as it is the home of the brave ', 
  ` and one for yourself ', 
  in ireland , we label white thrash brits as ` lagerlouts ' and generally avoid any places they like to go on holidays . 
  very possible - do n't haven an exact date as was pretty much piecing together from a history book, 
  * the l.e. 
  macha called to gibraltar to refuel , resupply and patrol alongside british navy vessels on the outward and homeward journeys . 
  she was the first irish vessel to berth there and the officers paid and received a number of visits from naval and civilian dignatories . 
  these included governor-general anderson , governor of gibraltar ; rear-admiral brooking , the royal navy flag officer at gibraltar ; archbishop dr fitzgerald , bishop of gibraltar and mr roberts , the american consul based there . 
  a british destroyer , the h.m.s. 
  childers was in port and the british and irish sailors exchanged visits . 
  tours of the ` rock ' were also organised for the men , leading commander mckenna to comment ` the lads are in their element . 
  the irish half of the r.n. 
  ( royal navy ) are taking them around the place . 
  the national motto of ireland is ` c\u00e9ad m\u00edle f\u00e1ilte ' which means ` one hundred thousand welcomes ' . 
  r/ireland is expanding downwards next to r/europe - there will be no room for spain, 
  r/ireland & r/europe side by side let 's get some more member states up in that space . 
  ( sorry , not you r/unitedkingdom :( ), 
  republic of ireland citizens are overwhelmingly in favour of reuinfication , per national polls . 
  the ira ` officially ' was fighting against foreign british occupation in irish lands . 
  they did not recognise northern ireland as a british state , but as an illegally annexed one . 
  regardless , the ira were a terrorist organisation - they did not represent the will of the irish people . 
  with that being said , it is also erudite to make the point that british military also acted as and committed acts of terrorism in ni throughout their reign - bloody sunday kilings : not to mention the british genocide of ireland [ famine without de jure natural cause ], 
  the photographer choose to shoot in black and white for the news desk in his series of candid troubles photos , and thirty years later deciding to retouch for a national exhibit . 
  original work . 
  erudite point, 
  thank you !, 
  the irish for ` good luck ' is ' go n-eiri an mbothar leat ' which directly translates as ` may the road rise to meet you ' emanating ` may you find your way to your journeys goal ', 
  the united kingdom is n't * technically * a democracy by official political standards . 
  ** 650 mps ** elected by first past the post ( fptp ) . 
  what does that mean ? 
  the majority of people 's votes ( 52.8 % of those cast in 2010 ) went to candidates that were not elected . 
  in addition to this , around 380 seats are `` safe '' seats , which means that a party will get elected regardless of who the candidate is . 
  therefore the number of candidates that meaningfully undergo an election every 5 years is just 268 , and the number of people who actually decide those results is less than half a million . 
  is that democratic ? 
  largely not . 
  ** 763 lords ** mostly appointed by sitting mps . 
  a further 92 lords are appointed by birth , like the queen . 
  then there are 26 lords who are chosen because of their role in the established church of england . 
  what does that mean ? 
  peerage '' is a quack system of privilege conferred by the queen that has feudal origins . 
  the life peerage act of 1958 then allowed the government to create life peerages , like the queen . 
  normally the prime minister chooses peers ( from their party 's major donors ) , and since 2000 there has been a tokenistic `` house of lords appointments commission '' which seems to just demonstrate that no-one really knows whats going on when it comes to choosing who should sit in parliament 's upper chamber .
