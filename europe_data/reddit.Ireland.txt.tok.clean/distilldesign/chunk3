  is that democratic ? 
  lord no . 
  ** 21 royals ** selected by cognatic primogeniture , otherwise known as the big womb lottery . 
  what does that mean ? 
  there are currently 20 royals with the hrh prefix , plus the queen herself . 
  these people are largely puppets who add ceremonial flourish to the rest of the uk government . 
  8 members of the royal family receive parliamentary annuities and have their own roles and powers . 
  no-one actually knew what the `` royal perogative '' could entail until it was written down in 2003 as including a list of 15 powers . 
  because the queen is unelected , she ca n't actually do many of these powers by choice , but that means that the prime minister can , without asking parliament . 
  is that democratic ? 
  not even slightly . 
  we do n't have official regulations is what i was saying - you * can * swim on all beaches , that does n't mean you * should *, 
  is \u00e9 an tainm nd\u00fan na ngall ? 
  or ireland . 
  scotland and ireland form a celtic union , take isle of man and gibraltar under wing , europe is europe , everyone is happy . 
  such a sad state of affairs . 
  as much as i 'd like to see a united ireland someday , i do n't want to see a broken uk either . 
  yes !, 
  very popular for swimming . 
  you can pretty much swim in all the beaches in ireland , we do n't have very much restrictions and they can be warm in the summer time !, 
  tag !, 
  someone has posted full article here - but this article itself was n't behind a paywall ( for me anyway , i do n't have subscription and could read the whole thing ) vielen dank, 
  these are visible exports on the balance of paymens . 
  none of these are your so called ` phantom exports ' , you may want to study up a bit of economics kiddo . 
  i 'm sorry do you mean the same northern ireland that was annexed from the republic of ireland ? 
  whooops, 
  looks like northern ireland could reunify with the republic within the net ten years anyway , and scotland is on its way out . 
  ireland and the uk already has free movement of people since before the eu , both countries have a common travel agreement and will continue to do so after brexit . 
  the problem here is the customs union - people living on one side of the border and working on the other . 
  this will take the worry away from so many people living in the border . 
  it seems like britain does n't give a shit about northern ireland , while the eu & the republic of ireland are fighting its corner - must feel strange to have another state stand up for you than your own state . 
  i hope to see a reunified , stronger , pro-eu all island ireland very soon . 
  yay looks like ireland is out of the pigs and back to swimming in cashish . 
  it was proposed a few years ago , for a dublin < -  wales < -  france tunnel to be made ( extension of eurotunnel ) but alas nothing has happened since, 
  one word : brexit, 
  it 's incorrect .

  - the irish navy donated l\u00c9 aoife - a naval vessel - to the malta armed forces in 2015 : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/l%c3%89_aoife_ ( p22 ) - malta is one of the three english speaking languages in europe : ireland , u.k & malta . 
  and will be one of the two remaining english speaking countries post-brexit . 
  - only other eu island state apart from ireland . 
  - after ireland 's economic recovery , the economic growth of malta and ireland are on a par and are expected to be the highest two in the eu for 2017 . 
  whoever created this map clearly did n't understand that ireland is a separate and distinct country from the uk, 
  what can you do to protect yourself in europe , from nation-state surveillance ? 
  12.3 % ** is ** the effective corporate tax rate in ireland . 
  11 eu member states have lower tax rates than ireland . 
  ireland is ** not ** a tax haven , and since ireland closed the ` double-irish ' scheme at the request of europe . 
  europa is stronk, 
  i was on my way to platform 9\u00a03/4 last night after a few whiskeys too, 
  lewis was born in belfast in the late 1800 's far before there was a ` northern ireland ' , the name of the country was ` ireland ' if you are not informed of tot own history . 
  c.s lewis was openly proud of his irish heritage and wrote a piece titled ` my irish life ' in which he proclaimed how strange and culturally different england was on first entering cambridge, 
  there is far more famous irish people than listed here ? 
  - liam neeson - colin farrel - bono - michael fassbender - mel gibson - conor mcgregor - john f. kennedy - c.s lewis - oscar wilde - james joyce - martin sheen , by extension charlie sheen - macklemore - hozier - saoirse ronan need i go on, 
  excerpt from irish taoiseach [ prime minister ] enda kenny 's speech to donald trump at annual us-ireland lunch & irish-american history month launch . 
  the country of ireland is the only eu-member state with access to an annual state visit to the united states white house . 
  the irish diaspora is the second largest demographic of voters in the american electorate , with an estimated 40,000,000 documented irish descendants in america . 
  * eu-us relationship i am glad to say , as i did here last year , that ireland 's economic recovery continues . 
  last year our economy grew by 5.2 % and employment is at the highest level since 2008 . 
  and in this context it is worth mentioning the significant contribution that irish firms make to the us economy . 
  more than 700 irish owned companies export to usa , an estimated 65 % of these having a full time presence in the market . 
  at the same time , many us firms have chosen ireland as their preferred european location , as an access point to markets of the european union and beyond . 
  this two-way relationship between us demonstrates the benefits to the us of its relationship with ireland as a committed member of the european union . 
  membership of the european union has been transformative for ireland 's economy and society . 
  ireland has always been a fully participating member . 
  that will not change . 
  the european union is , above all else , a community of nations built on shared values -- these values include human dignity , freedom and democracy , equality , and the rule of law . 
  values that i know are shared on this side of the atlantic . 
  and we consider that the strong economic , political and cultural relationship between the european union and the united states is vital as a force for good in today 's fragile and challenging global environment . 
  as a committed member of the eu and a close friend of the united states , we will work very hard with you mr. president and your administration in pursuit of strong and open relations between the us & eu , including mutually beneficial trade relationships , for millions on either side of the atlantic . 
  i believe the strong people-to-people links that ireland and the united states have developed over the generations can help us in this endeavour . 
  while we respect the uk 's decision to leave the eu , i continue to believe it is bad for britain , for ireland and for europe . 
  and while we will miss the united kingdom as a fellow member and ally in the eu , we will be absolutely thorough in protecting and advancing our interests by seeking the best possible outcome from the forthcoming brexit negotiations . 
  in this regard , we are absolutely determined to protect the northern ireland peace process , to minimise any negative economic impact , to maintain our common travel area with britain and to promote a stronger , more effective european union in the years ahead . 
  i firmly believe that the eu can and will continue to be a force for good on the global stage . 
  ireland and europe will never be the enemy of the united states . 
  fertility and whiskey, 
  it is top quality actually , very sweet from what i can remember . 
  the irishman is a lesser known brand - but still pretty good quality , it would be more for export than local consumption but nonetheless it 's quite excellent !, 
  enjoy !, 
  updated the list - tis n'all leann foil\u00e9an is a fav of mine . 
  fuck , forgot that , always been a bushmills man myself , teelings is kinder pricey for a non-high end whiskey, 
  there are 80,000,000 irish abroad - the likelihood is most of these countries do actually have a large irish community . 
  the irish diaspora is one of the largest in the world . 
  sadly , yes i agree a lot of it has just been about getting drunk , in recent times . 
  that 's why i included the info about culture . 
  funny you should mention halloween - halloween is also a holiday of irish descent , it started off here in ireland as ` o\u00edche samshana ', 
  exactly - we 're all riding the same ship , may as well enjoy it . 
  good to hear !, 
  is there much happens up the north ?
