  or is it still kindve a sectarian issue ? 
  i know - this is just talking about the eu though .

  for more info / the article is pretty poorly written , i shared for the photos , but have written a proper info introduction here  irelands national holiday [ st. patrick 's day ] is one of the most widely celebrated national holidays around the globe , in recent years it has widely been associated with drunkenness , and ` good times ' and its commercializations can lose a lot of its value - it is important to remember that the day represents the culture of the irish - one of the largest diasporas in the world . 
  for a population of 6 million , the estimated size of the irish diaspora is estimated to be around 80,000,000 people . 
  reasons for the exponentially larger diaspora are often attributed to mass emigration as a result of the 1800 famine . 
  irish people are very proud of their european identity , and per eurostat ; ireland is one of the most pro-eu countries . 
  ireland might seem a little distant cut off from our continental friends , but we 're europe as the heart of ireland . 
  if you 're looking to read more about irish culture you should read : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture_of_ireland if you 're interesting in trying out irish alcohol as in the day that 's in it , popular irish brands are : ** whiskeys : ** irish whiskeys are widely regarded as some of the worlds most distinctive blends , they are triple distilled in copper pot stills and usually made in the traditional way . 
  the oldest distillery in the world is the bushmills distillery in antrim , ireland , licensed to open in 1604 .

  wholeheartedly agree - as much as i 'd like to a see a united ireland in my lifetime , i do n't really want to see the u.k. collapse unnessecarily either . 
  i just spotted that , i genuinely had stupidly misread as ` europes ' , my apologies . 
  the title is 1:1 the same as the one in the article ? 
  i see, 
  northern ireland is n't a member state of the europeans union , the uk is and the uk is already accounted for here . 
  ... our plan to have a dublin run europa edges closer to reality, 
  just as i suspected , a british nationalist with the same number of brain cells as hitler had testicles . 
  mostly in jest  - but many years ago there would have been a strong push for cork to be the countries capital because of its adversial and rebellious relationship to british rule , where dublin would have been seen to have prospered from british rule ( it being the second city of the british empire for a little under 600 years ), 
  this not true at all , the majority of the electorate in cork stood for ff , followed by fg which are centre-right parties . 
  ( perhaps centre-left on some policies , but mostly capitalist ), 
  two harps , two irelands ? 
  it 's a joke - peace park in cork is famous for its magic mushroom culture , so the joke being his brother saw karl marx in a vision, 
  there 's no * claiming * here - john f. kennedy is of direct irish descent , and was a frequent visitor of ireland , he also proclaimed the month of march irish-american history month and funded the body that represents the 40million irish in america . 
  additionally , barack obama who is also of irish descent , visited his grandmothers hometown 7 years ago in ireland , swore us military protection for ireland ( something very few countries have ) , was awarded the freedom of dublin in 2016 , and is due to return to ireland in august 2017 . 
  the point that you make about the # 20bn the uk loaned to the irish governemnt in 2009 is an interesting one , for you see you may want to check your facts , the british government held about # 228bn pounds in irish state assets and bonds as purchased since the 1970s as , like other state governments , it deemed them a low-risk investment - so if the uk were not to have bailed us out , ** it would have lost a great deal financially ** do n't think for one second that the uk bailed us out of the kindness of their hearts . 
  anyway , i 'm not going to go on anymore because you seem like one of those ignorant british nationalists who have more breath to waste than brain cells . 
  for reference , the ` peoples republic of cork ' is a term of endearment for cork city & county in ireland . 
  cork is likened to spains catalonia , or germany 's bavaria in that it has always had its own independent/separatist state of mind . 
  a brief description of cork : cork is irelands second most populous city . 
  it is traditionally irelands most republican city , and never really had a influencing british presence , the city clung onto its celtic roots even during british occupation . 
  in 2005 cork was elected as the european capital of culture . 
  cork is irelands foodie capital and prides itself in fresh artisan produce , it is also home to europes largest roofed food marked - ` the english market ' . 
  corkonians [ citizens of cork ] often refer to the city as `` the real capital '' in reference to the city 's role as the centre of anti-treaty forces during the irish civil war . 
  cork was founded in the sixth century . 
  the deepest natural port in the world is cork port . 
  cork is the home of the the old midleton distillery - where jameson irish whiskey is made . 
  sound one cheers lad, 
  we 're a neutral country , so not for any expansionist reasons . 
  i would assume its just for increasing the defence - also the turnover is quite high at the moment , as some of the soldiers are n't happy with pay for un missions . 
  ireland is still quite mineral wealthy - not sure if it peaked in norman era . 
  yes , but why would you compare gaul to ireland ? 
  we 're not talking about gauls roman invasion , we 're talking about the lack of a roman invasion in ireland . 
  that 's like saying ` italy had far more inhabitants ' yes it did but it has no relevance to ireland . 
  the population , per the natural history museum of ireland for 50-0bc was estimated to be around 200,000-400 ,000 , yes slightly lower than britains estimated 1m but not hugely decisive . 
  they did have a lot of valuable things to trade - hibernian-roman trade was huge , and indeed a huge amount of slaves were sold from celtic irish . 
  additionally , irish kingdoms sold metals and metallurgy works to the romans - examples of which can still be seen today , ardagh chalice . 
  the irish celts heavily influenced the bronze age , and were arguable the most skilled metalworkers of their time . 
  maybe perception in rome was different - but the island was far more rich in mineral and natural wealth than england , and even some of the continental states , at the time . 
  the countries mineral wealth is what lead dublin to be the largest viking cities outside scandinavia . 
  this mentions nothing about * fertility of land , number of population , or lack of natural resources * as in your original comment . 
  i agree to somewhat with your above excerpt . 
  however , historians have highlighted that ireland was exceptionally mineral rich in and of bc 55 through to the norman invasion . 
  i see them now  still though , no romans ever conquered ireland - although hibernian-roman trade was large . 
  some of the largest forests in europe , here in ireland , helped fuel the normans when they invaded ireland . 
  the country also has huge deposits of copper , lead , dolomite , barite , limestone , gypsum , silver and zinc which all would have been useful to the roman empire . 
  ireland as a geographic country was more mineral rich than england & wales at the time , [ ignoring coal , ireland had peat ] , which the romans were n't using anyway . 
  additionally , regarding your comment to the fertility of irish land - the majority of irish countryside is incredibly fertile , which is why ireland has one of the largest agricultural industries in europe , i do n't see where on earth you would think the country is infertile mineral wealth & amp ; natural resources has nothing to do with why the romans did n't invade ireland - the country itself was far more plagued with natural resources than its continental counterparts - hence the that theory being widely debunked by irish historians . 
  there is an old tale that an irish chieftain offered to help agricola invade ireland if he would let the chieftain rule the island , but there discussions fell short and so the chieftain threatened to invade britain and negotiations ceased to exist . 
  the reason for the invasion never happening is the roman resources were stretched across most of europe , and they probably could n't afford to fight multiple battles with irish kingdoms - additionally they were fighting the scottish uprising , and so resources were further stretched . 
  ireland was made up of lots of little kingdoms at the time , and trade both slave and grain and metallurgy was bustling . 
  from what i know from history , hibernian ( celtic ) - roman trade was huge , and relations were generally good . 
  if you 're wondering why ireland is clear - ireland was never invaded by the roman empire . 
  had n't checked my notifications !, 
  right you are too !, 
  ireland is ireland , the official name of the state is ` ireland ' and both the un & eu refers to us as ` ireland ' . 
  if you 'd like to differentiate between ni and roi then just call us ireland and ni northern ireland . 
  please tell me what niemcy means ???? 
  also , did somebody say anschluss !?!, 
  amazon.eu would be great - i mean most of the european stock is held in logistics centres in amsterdam/dublin/koln anyway for the time being i 've been using amazon.de - although not as good as . co.uk sometimes prices are better, 
  you do n't even recognise ireland ?? 
  scotland was settled by the irish , at d\u00e1l riata , there has obviously been some gene pool mixing but the scottish are largely descendants of the irish celts . 
  additionally about 48 % of the population of northern ireland is stated as irish catholic on the census - the other 52 % could be comprised of irish , scotch-irish descendants , and to a lesser extent - anglican . 
  * racist * - you do realise republican irish people are the same fucking race as northern irish people ? 
  no denying they were terrorists , agree there . 
  you make a good point , well to be fair , it 's hard to find a piece of derry that is n't covered in republican graffiti, 
  i 'm sure the photography was arranged - but they did indeed frisk people , as did the provos publicity was a huge part of the campaign, 
  no set up - these are actual cumann na mbann soldiers from the 1970s in derry ? 
  i believe, 
  you keep mentioning ` tax-haven ' status , but in actual fact both the european central bank and world bank have refuted the countries status as a tax haven - it is ** not ** a traditional tax haven . 
  until you can find one source from an internationally respected organization citing its status as a tax haven , your point is mere conjecture . 
  this effective tax rate is for one ) based on a study of two american companies which have been resident in ireland since the 1970s - pre eu , and were given tax incentives at the time . 
  additionally , ireland does n't charge tax on profits repatriated back to the us , as it is not responsible to do - neither does belgium/austria/netherlands and many more . 
  this pwc study is highly refuted , the eu commission rejected its findings and agreed that ireland 's effective corporate tax rate of 12.2 % did apply to the vast majority of foreign transnationals with the exception of few , like apple , who had existing pre-eu tax incentives . 
  have since deleted and will rephrase thanks for letting me know, 
  that 's what i mean ? 
  ireland is ** not ** a tax haven . 
  irelands corporation tax rate is 12.3 % - which is n't even the lowest in the eu by a long shot . 
  additionally , ireland has since closed the double-irish loophole . 
  sworn military protection from the us doj . 
  as reiterated most recently by obamas speech at college green in 2013 - * ` america will stand by you , at a time when your peace is jeopardized ' *, 
  low corporate tax rates are a catalysts to attracting fdi , yes that 's i agree on , but no they do n't attract investment on their own . 
  if you provide one fact or study to actually back up your point then i 'd take you seriously . 
  ireland is ** not ** a tax haven . 
  low corporate tax does not equal ` haven ' . 
  ireland charges 12.2 % - which is n't even the lowest in the eu by a long shot . 
  basis ? 
  this is an image of one of the smaller protests - there was a far larger protest outside the d\u00e1il - our seat of government & the department of health & the department of justice & all the cities bridges . 
  you do n't really expect one image to showcase all these do you ? 
  ireland is ** not ** a tax haven .
