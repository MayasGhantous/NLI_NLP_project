  the temp would be high enough to use it about 2 % of the year . 
  that is quite possible ... 
  i may have suggested to a slightly more gullible than normal tourist that they should visit a certain street in the city known for it 's sightings of leprechauns before ... 
  last week , each of my customers commented that the weather was so bad , and it terrible , there 's no summer at all , etc etc. 
  yesterday , i called up to my mam 's for a chat and the first thing she said was `` it 's far to hot today , is n't it ? '', 
  there 's no winning with us !, 
  oh i know , i 'm very lucky tbh !, 
  forgot rent - average in dublin is like $ 1600-1700pm per property . 
  my share of the rent in my apartment is $ 600pm, 
  coffee : $ 2 for an espresso , maybe $ 3.50 for a latte/cappuccino beer : a 500ml bottle in the off licence - $ 1.50 for pisswater up to say $ 3 for decent beer . 
  in a pub , between $ 5 and $ 6.50 depending on the beer milk : 80c/90c for a litre bread : about $ 1.20 / $ 1.30 i guess standard ticket on the bus : $ 2.05 ( but tbh there 's a pretty complicated daily/weekly capping system in place that means you usually do n't pay anything for the bus towards the end of the week if you 're a frequent user , s i 'd say the average is a but lower ) eating out : a sambo $ 5-6 , a meal anywhere from $ 15 to as much as you 'd like to pay , street food , i dunno maybe $ 7-8 for a meal ? 
  a cinema ticket : my local cinema is $ 11 for 2d , $ 12 for 3d and $ 14 for isense films . 
  but you can pay extra for premier seating and the food prices are outrageous - popcorn and coke will be $ 10 easy . 
  about 5km away - roughly 20/25 mins on the bus depending on traffic then a 10 min walk . 
  in secondary school we have a ( i think mandatory , ca n't remember ) class called cspe which is civic social and political education , which goes through the structure of government , constitution , current and recent taoisigh and presidents etc. 
  it 's thought over 3 years and is a junior cert ( first of two state exams ) exam subject . 
  here , national government delegates certain laws to local authorities ( either city or county councils ) , but with very limited scope . 
  for example , here we have 4 kinds of roads m ( motorway ) , n ( national ) , r ( regional ) and l ( local ) . 
  setting speed limited for r and l roads has been delegated to the local authorities , but within parameters ( ca n't be higher than 80km/h ) now that i think about it , city and county councils can also set planing guidelines for the area , and the central government does n't really have any say in this , so i suppose thats one very small area where the local law is more powerful than the national one . 
  i 'm not aware of any national guidelines they are required to follow . 
  # 1 = $ 1.27 you can exchange them at the central bank . 
  we have a upper house that badly needs reform - it 's called the seanad ( irish for senate ) . 
  most citizen 's do n't get a vote , 11 are appointed by the taoiseach ( pm ) , 6 are elected by graduates of two universities ( 3 from trinity college and 3 from national university of ireland ) , 43 from vocational panels ( 7 x admin panel , 11 x agriculture panel , 5 x cultural and educational panel , 9 x industrial and commercial panel and 11 x labour panel , elected by tds , outgoing senators and members of local government ) powers include delaying a bill for apx 9 months ( but not a finance bill ) after this time the dail ( lower house ) can just proceed on its own . 
  due to the fact that the taoiseach can appoint 11 members , the government of the day in the dail is effectively guaranteed a majority in the seanad as well . 
  there was an attempt to abolish it a few years ago , but this did n't go ahead . 
  the government have stated that they plan on reforming it , but there 's been no moves on that in quite a while . 
  for personal income , your employer does it all for you . 
  basically on income below 33k its 20 % , and its 40 % on income above that ( if you earn 40k , it 's 20 % x 33k and 40 % x 7k ) . 
  but , we get tax credits for various different things , and this comes off your tax bill , so if your tax liability was 10k , and you have tax credits of 3k , then you only owe 7k . 
  you are also liable for usc ( universal social charge ) and prsi ( pay related social insurance ) which are for things like healthcare . 
  there 's also vat charged at 23 % on most things ( some are tax exempt , some stuff is 12.5 % , and the hospitality industry only pays 11 % ) . 
  prices are always inclusive of vat . 
  for business profits , corporation tax applies , and that 's 12.5 % . 
  yeah pretty happy with it . 
  it 's $ 50 a month , but i got a free phone at the start of the contract so i 'm really paying for that . 
  then i get unlimited data , texts and calls . 
  would be pretty unusual to not have 4g coverage . 
  download speeds normally about 20mbps, 
  ireland ( 1-100 ) secondary school a1 : 90 + a2 : 85-89 b1 : 80 - 84 b2 : 75 - 79 b3 : 70 - 74 c1 : 65 - 69 c2 : 60 - 64 c3 : 55 - 59 d1 : 50 - 54 d2 : 45 - 49 d3 : 40 - 44 e : 20 - 39 ng : 0 - 19 ( no grade ) 40 + is a pass university 70 + = 1.1 / first class honours 60-69 = 2.1 / second class honours , upper 50-59 = 2.2 / second class honours , lower 40-49 = pass 0-39 = fail just in case you 're thinking that 70 is a stupidly low number for a high mark on a degree , papers are in effect graded out of 80 for the most part . 
  it would be unheard of for someone to get higher than 80 ( unless it was a , for example , quantitative exam , where you 're either right or wrong ), 
  canada , new zealand or aus . 
  jaysus where to i start ... we are all catholic , rural dwelling , backward , potato eating , fighting drunks who speak like leprechauns if you believe the stereotypes . 
  off the top of my head , indian , generic asian , polish , mexican , italian and maybe a german section in the chilled isle . 
  usually some kind of prank . 
  putting cling film all over the principal 's car seems to be a common in . 
  in the country , id have to agree with op and say donegal . 
  outside ireland , there 's something about an edinburgh accent on a good looking woman ... 
  not very big . 
  and the rest of us think vegans are weird . 
  suits for the guys , dresses for the girls , then go to a party afterwards ( in our case with the teachers , that was actually a great night ) then a few months later you have your debs ( debutant ball ) which is more formal , sit down meal , music , awards etc. 
  this again is suits and fancy dresses . 
  followed of course by a nightclub . 
  we have stop search seize which follows the police , immigration and customs . 
  there was one that was only the traffic police a few years ago on rte but i forget the name . 
  there was a really good show about ambulance crews and the 112 call takers called paramedics earlier this year and it 's coming back for another season as far as i know . 
  majority are based in dublin . 
  there was a scheme a while back to try and move some agencies to other towns and cities around the country , but turns out no one who worked in these agencies wanted to move so they scrapped that . 
  the only major ones i can think of is the department of social protection which is based up in sligo or donegal , and education is in athlone i think . 
  here you would always offer the last piece to the person you 're eating with , buy you 'd secretly hope they said they did n't want it , ( you would maybe follow with `` are you sure now '' ) so then you can have it guilt free . 
  outside ireland , getting drunk inside ireland , for being either incredibly rough or incredibly posh , depending on which side of the river you happen to love on, 
  username involves potato - gon na take a stab in the dark and assume this guy/gal is one of my fellow countrymen . 
  containing it to the core city centre , for nicest city , i think it would have to be [ kilkenny ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?q=kilkenny+city&amp;safe=off&amp;client=ms-android-huawei&amp;prmd=imnv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjwxpj9-opuahuiasakhbercoaq_auicsgb ) or maybe [ galway ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?safe=off&amp;client=ms-android-huawei&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=262&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=ybcjwfuyoojqgaa6k43ibw&amp;q=galway+city&amp;btng= ) . 
  for ugliest , i think limerick gets the prize . 
  have never been overly impressed by it . 
  i would have assumed that second person was planning to kill me tbh . 
  i could n't bring myself to eat an animal that i associate as being a pet . 
  so would be ditto for cats , hampsters , guinea pigs ( no problem with real pigs tho ) , rabbits etc, 
  as someone from dublin : northside dublin accent - skanger ( irish slang for a chav i suppose would be the best way to describe it ) inner city dublin - see northside southside dublin - very posh kildare/wicklow/meath ( dublin commuter belt ) - kinda normal people , commute into the city to work , go home and live in civilised society dundalk - traveller of some kind northern ireland - not to be trusted , they may be ... one of them ... galway - good guys , great craic cork - bit if an inferiority complex ( second city and all that ) kerry - idiots who keep voting for the healy rays various other rural accents - bogers with no knowledge of how the real world works ( also applies to kerry ) the above are all absolute facts, 
  hug would be very common - kiss on the cheek becoming more so , though would only be male-female or female-female . 
  hug between two guys would n't be common exactly but would n't be weird either . 
  depends on the moment !, 
  draft is the correct pronunciation but it 's spelt draught  this is an old irish granny 's worst fear - draughts have been known to kill depending on which you speak to . 
  work 9-5 , usually take somewhere between 30mins to 1hr , depending on how busy i am . 
  monday . 
  yeah it would be pretty common here to move companies to get better pay , especially in the industry i 'm in ( financial services ) . 
  helps that you can move your private pension with you , so there is n't really any barrier to it bar the initial upheaval of switching jobs . 
  we snuck out without telling anyone . 
  plan was to get out without being noticed, 
  i 've been refused in aldi because my little brother was with me and he did n't have id . 
  the fact that the beer was for me and i 'm in my 20s did n't matter , they were n't willing to take the chance i might give it to him . 
  as if i 'd bring him in with me if that was the plan !, 
  it is possible to set up a non resident account in ireland , but you 're subjected to higher than normal kyc ( know your customer ) checks . 
  you 'd likely be asked to provide evidence of source of funds and wealth , as well as the usual id and address verification . 
  what about us ? 
  we 're a separate country . 
  ours is nice and simple , it 's just a [ harp on a blue background ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/coat_of_arms_of_ireland.svg/1280px-coat_of_arms_of_ireland.svg.png ) . 
  a quick google says it 's been around in some form or another since 1541 , and today it 's used on all official government seals , on the reverse of irish euros , on our passports and it 's also the presidential standard . 
  really depends on how good your id is and how much the bouncer / person working in the shop looks at it . 
  there 's a pretty heavy fine and the cops here will send people under 18 into shops/pubs to see if they 'll get served so do n't be surprised if you do n't get served - especially in the bigger supermarket chains . 
  generally refer to the counties separately , so england , scotland , wales and `` the north '' . 
  referring to them as a while tho it would be the uk . 
  in dublin , transport costs are capped at $ 10 per day across all operators so you could travel all day around the city . 
  fit distance , if you book online a few days in advance you 'll have no trouble getting a bus or train to the other end of the country for $ 20 , so probably about 300km or so, 
  would n't have thought it would be anywhere bear that amount !, 
  just shows you how media evolves over time !, 
  sure , i understand the practicalities , just more so find it hard to believe that someone can be that popular the tiny amount of revenue each ad provides can add up to an amount that you can live off quite comfortably . 
  think i need to find an untapped niche in the market and start making videos !, 
  i do really enjoy a good french accent tbh , not gon na lie . 
  could listen to a french woman speak ( french or english ) all day, 
  the idea that someone can make a living by posting youtube videos baffles me .
