  my company offers 23 for example , and that goes up with seniority and length of service . 
  if you 're hitting up ireland on your way 3 . ie has all you can eat calls data and texts for $ 20 per month on pre pay . 
  free eu roaming so you can use that where ever, 
  would be pretty strick here - if you look less than 25 you 're gon na get id 'd . 
  the cops will also send teenagers in to see if they get id 'd and if they get the beer . 
  the fines are huge , the shop can even be shut down and the cashier can be personally prosecuted . 
  i 'd say we 'd be a 2/3 if were restricting it to the usa - half the country claims irish ancestry . 
  world wide , probably 5 - we 've a large diaspora and northern ireland put us on the world stage for quite a while there , but at the end of the day , were still a small country on the edge of europe . 
  just to give the full process in ireland theory exam - 40 questions , 35/40 required to pass . 
  you then get your learners permit , allows you to take your driving lessons - you take as many as your instructor feels you need , but a minimum of 12 must be taken . 
  once you/you 're instructor is happy , you take your test . 
  there 's three categories of faults during the test , grade 1 , 2 and 3 . 
  a grade 3 will fail you automatically . 
  2x grade 2s will fail you and some number of grade 1s will fail you - ca n't think how many . 
  once you pass , you 're a novice driver for 2 years - this means you get more penalty points for some offences that fully qualified drivers , and the disqualification amount is set at 8 points for novice drivers instead of the normal 12 . 
  after the two years the restrictions are lifted and you 're fully qualified driver . 
  whole process ( assuming no fails/repeats ) would probably : theory test : 100 permit : 30 lessons : 50ishx12 = 600 test : 100 license : 40 = = = $ 870 its not cheap !, 
  i did indeed !, 
  thanks, 
  www.irishjobs.ie , www.jobs.ie , www.indeed.ie , www.fas.ie ( government training service site ) or www.monster.ie will set you straight for ireland, 
  sexual orientation - most people could n't care less . 
  what you do in your bedroom is your business . 
  actually speaking about sex - would n't exactly be a common topic , but i would n't say its taboo ( maybe among the older generation who would be more catholic ), 
  probably game of thrones when its on . 
  its one of the few series that you really have to watch yourself talking about so you do n't spoil it on anyone !, 
  exact same here as well with one exception - we do have school sports teams and they 'll play other schools in the region . 
  nowhere near the same level of hype the americans put into it though . 
  its usually held in a gaa pitch with 30 people watching or if its planned well , it might be held during lunch hour so you could go up and support the lads in your class . 
  if you did n't know people playing you would n't go and support though - we do n't have that school spirit you were talking about earlier, 
  yeah this threw me a bit too . 
  sports are incredibly important here . 
  we just do n't to the whole cheer leading/mascot shite . 
  i think proportionally the older population would have more conservatives than any other cohort , but the majority of older people are of the live and let live variety , especially over the last 15/20 years . 
  the ssm referendum result last year shows this, 
  this and them getting onto the bus in the morning at 8:00 am when you 're trying to get work asking the driver 100 and 1 questions . 
  ` hi there good morning does this bus go to the botanical gardens ' ` how much is the fare ' ` oh you do n't take notes or give change ? 
  let me route through my purse for an hour and find some ' ` can you let me know when my stop is ' listen lads , we 've all got places to be at the hour of the morning . 
  can agree on the following please ? 
  - get yourself a visitor leap card ( you 'll save a fortune anyway , the cash rates are extortion ) - download one of the 5 million apps that are available to check which bus goes where , or just use google maps , or for a really novel idea real the time table on the bus stop ( most of the city centre has free wi-fi , as does every bus in the city - do n't give me data as an excuse ) - listen to the nice lady who announces the stops , or read the sign that displays the next stop , and then press the button in good time and get off . 
  if ye ca n't do the above , can ye at least wait till 10am til everyone is in work ? 
  cheers . 
  while it would n't be a hugely common pastime , non-swimmers are very rare . 
  you learn to swim as part of pe in school . 
  its up to each school how they want to teach it - we did 10 weeks a year when were in 3rd , 4th and 5th class ( 9/10/11yo ) if i remember correctly . 
  in secondary school it was n't lessons as such as everyone could swim , but to vary the pe curriculum up we 'd go swimming 4/5 times per year . 
  we were lucky though , we had a swimming pool very close to us, 
  we 've 26 counties in the republic and 6 in the north . 
  i 've been to all , my last job had be on the road all the time ) . 
  i 'd say i 'd would be common enough that people would have visited all or at least most . 
  its not a huge country . 
  a few people have done charity challenges to visit all 32 counties in 24 hours - its just about possible . 
  here its 3,000 per year of university education , but if you 're family 's income is below a certain threshold , the state will pay the university directly for you . 
  depending on family income , your own part time income , and how far you live from where you 're studying ( basically if you need to rent bear your college ) you may also qualify for a grant which is a monthly payment ( between 100 and 500 euro depending on circumstances ) to help you live . 
  being honest , i never really thought about it too much . 
  i 'd say there 's two main issues at play . 
  1 ) irish papers would n't really have a wide international readership . 
  i 've no figures to hand but i 'd say 95 % of copies are sold in the republic . 
  2 ) ireland does n't really have huge influence abroad - so its hard in a way to relate the story back to relevance for the readership . 
  i would point out through - each of the above papers ( tabloids included ) will have an international section and will cover world events there . 
  also , its worth noting , for major world events there will be wall to wall coverage of it , and it will be front page . 
  i do n't read papers usually , so there may have been more since , but the most recent one i remember was the paris attacks last year - this was plastered all over every newspaper - the irish president could have been having an affair with a 20 year old swim model and it would n't have made front page !, 
  giving out about a 5 min delay is the most swiss thing i 've ever heard haha . 
  irish rail only counts a train as late if its 10 mins or more late !, 
  i had no idea land before time was made here . 
  loved that film as a kid, 
  [ irish independent ] ( https://www.ebow.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/irish-independent.jpg ) - used to be a good source , but is more tabloid like now [ irish times ] ( http://a2012.kiosko.net/08/20/ie/irish_times.750.jpg ) - main broadsheet , you 'll get decent news out of this one [ irish examiner ] ( http://a2011.kiosko.net/03/05/ie/irish_examiner.750.jpg ) - another decent quality paper .

  every city and county also has its own paper ( s ) but they deal with very local issues normally , or a local slant on a national one . 
  hope this helps !, 
  the only time we would ever have a full turkey is christmas day . 
  served with ham . 
  you can sliced turkey for sandwiches/rolls/wraps etc all year round though, 
  typical effin sunday, 
  was always sure it was feckin , but no , you 're right , its effin !, 
  i decided to go with rude place names in ireland . 
  we have a place in co. . donegal called [ muff ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=muff ) . 
  it has a diving club . 
  limerick also has a town called feckin , which facebook banned until recently . 
  we have dicksboro in co. . kilkenny . 
  we have fartrim in co. . cavan the town of cum , which us fantastically located in co. . mayo . 
  then there 's slutsend , in one the dublin suburbs . 
  we 've got bastardstown in co. . wexford , which is also home to fannystown . 
  [ do n't make unnecessary journeys ] ( http://img2.thejournal.ie/article/2485699/river/?height=400&amp;version=2485701 ) we had some bad storms a few months ago and this reporter , teresa manion , had some advice for everyone [ full news report ] ( http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1yueave01eq ) and also bonus [ remix version ] ( http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hwaghz_q8os ) i found while googling . 
  apartment buildings would nearly all have basement parking & bins etc , and buildings in city centres where space is a premium would often have them but other than that they would be very uncommon here . 
  common enough here , but less sugary stuff . 
  would be more wholegrain or wheat based . 
  you can still get stuff covered in chocolate if you want though . 
  every now and again though , you do need to treat yourself to a full irish or a breakfast roll from a deli , especially if you 're hungover . 
  dunno why , buy it helps,

  you 'd get bottle of cheap vodka in lidl or aldi for $ 7/8 - 70cl , 37 % ish . 
  you can also get ` wine ' there for 3 or 4 quid .
