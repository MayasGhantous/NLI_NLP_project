  but they 're not being authoritarian really - they were elected on a platform and were given a full mandate by polish voters . 
  i would say that the majority of the british public does n't like socialism - that 's why labour was out of office until tony blair changed the party 's direction and why jeremy corbyn is more unpopular than any politician in modern times . 
  we simply need to present the examples that the free market has brought the most prosperity to this country and others . 
  compare the 70s slump to the 80s boom when thatcher liberalised the economy , or the best capitalism success story - america . 
  capitalism and the free market is the best way to keep people from starving and achieving their full potential . 
  being handed everything from daddy government makes a people apathetic and unambitious . 
  i have to say , i 'm quite enjoying the new polish government . 
  they 're definitely strong in their convictions and put what they believe to be national interests above eu rules . 
  i do appreciate when a smaller country shows brussels whose boss !, 
  i mean capitalism . 
  i would hope it 's non ** sensual ** this is n't the bedroom . 
  it is perfectly ** sensible ** however to not want to be tied to a stagnant trade bloc on a dying continent . 
  we can change that here because there is still a strong current of people who believe in the market and in freedom . 
  france has no free market current and in germany it 's fringe parties like the fdp . 
  if we vote out and they do something like that all they will do is hand downing street to ukip . 
  i hope that does n't happen because while i like ukip very much i do n't think they 've developed enough to run a country although i would very much like to see them in a coalition . 
  we wo n't !, 
  oh god , did you really just make a 1984 reference ? 
  russia is bad but it 's not airstrip 1 . 
  another reason for us to vote out - britain has so much economic potential it need n't be bound to a moribund market and general economic wasteland where apathy and socialism rules like the european union . 
  good for the danes !, 
  democracy in action !, 
  it 's the left that seems to be most adamant about the eu . 
  again , regardless of all the politics i really hope that the people of crimea get their lights back on and have heat in their homes as soon as possible . 
   that goes for any place they would stay . 
  but any place is not my concern . 
   it 's morally imperative , somebody has to do it , and we 're better placed to do it than most . 
  actually , no one has to do it - someone chooses to do it . 
  being ` better placed ' is meaningless , my neighbour is better placed to pay my bills than i am , that does n't mean he should or will do such a thing . 
  we are n't a charity . 
   bottom line : nor we nor the refugees get to choose whether there is a war in syria , but we still have to deal with it : that 's life . 
  that 's true - but keeping them safe or even them being alive is not my priority if it will negatively affect the economy or our infrastructure . 
  my country 's interest is more important to me than their wellbeing . 
   i mean over the last year the uk received 636,000 immigrants alone . 
  yes , and it has been a humongous strain on our resources !, 
  not that i do n't believe that this but besides his word is there any other evidence that this happened ? 
   the eu has been built progressively towards more integration and federalism . 
  if you judge it by assuming that countries are and should stay perfectly independent , of course you 're going to be disappointed , since it 's precisely not the point . 
  which is why people like me are uncomfortable and no longer want anything to do with it . 
  but , why so * sudden * is the question ? 
  religiosity drops off gradually in a society . 
  did they suddenly unban contraception after franco died ? 
  the expansion of socialism ? 
  i mean it 's disingenuous to think of ww2 scenarios and put them in the current context . 
  it looks like births dropped rapidly as soon as franco died by the look of that bulge . 
  does anyone know what happened ? 
  very sad - they should start having more children !, 
  well , politics aside - i 'm glad the people of crimea will have their lights back on soon . 
  that 's absolutely true , however so many have already come it 's the numbers that are most concerning to me . 
  but , what does russia have to gain in that kind of scenario ? 
  i know that estonia and latvia has a large russian population but besides that the baltics are n't strategic enough for it to be worth it for them . 
  crimea is very strategically located for them on the black sea and they wanted to maintain their base there , they 're supporting assad because they want to maintain their base in tartus and their presence in the mediterranean , the donbass is resource rich . 
  why would they want the baltics ? 
  the only thing i could think of is better control of the baltic sea , and i know that riga was a large base during soviet times . 
  do estonians actually think that russia will invade them ? 
  maybe before they were in nato this was a possibility but i do n't think that they would risk an all out war over what amounts to insignificant territories . 
  that sounds good although that 's a big * if * however it 's the numbers i am uncomfortable with . 
  is it part of the re-admission agreement that we will be able to turn back boats coming to greece ? 
  because that 's the crux of it . 
  they will stop coming when the boats start getting turned back . 
  well , some could argue that war whatever the outcome is good for the economy . 
  i am not of that school of thought because whatever short term growth one gets in the war economy will be negatively offset by the loss of life and thus of workers and taxpayers . 
   haha . 
  do you really believe that ? 
  we , as a region , are rich because industrialisation happened earlier in the west , that 's it . 
  if you think different , that is pretty much like not believing in evolution . 
  if you work a normal amount in the west and in africa or something , you will become quite wealthy in the west and still be a poor sob in africa . 
  we in the west are rich because industrialisation happened earlier that 's true . 
  but do you know * why * ? 
  it was n't just a random thing where someone in the sky said `` oh look , there 's england i think i will have them industrialise now ! '', 
  no , it was because we worked very hard and did things to attain the resources needed for industrialisation - some of that included having colonies and i feel no shame about that , we had colonies because we were better at taking over territory than the people we colonised were at defending it . 
   most of the population thinks the same . 
  i can only repeat the same thing so often . 
  if you only think in terms of money , you are an outlier , and quite sick at that . 
  so yeah , no reason to keep this going if all you care about is money and ca n't understand that most normal humans have other things that they care about . 
  most normal humans are concerned about their quality of life , everything else emanates from that . 
  good economics and well maintained infrastructure is the cornerstone to high quality of life . 
  so while i am being a numbers man about this because numbers are what you can measure - that 's what it all boils down to . 
  the question is how will this grow the economy and improve infrastructure precisely because those are two keys to high standard of living . 
   i agree with you that if that is all you are about , your opinion is actually fitting to you . 
  but if you ca n't see how normal people think about the issue , you just should n't talk about it . 
  and certainly not be active in politics . 
  see above - your average person is concerned about their standard of living and their quality of life and how they can either maintain or improve that . 
  responsible governance , and sound economics is the key to that . 
  so the option is , bring everyone in turkey to europe or everyone in turkey will come to europe anyhow ? 
  since we are n't taking every person in turkey , how is turkey stopping the flow ? 
  if it can stop the flow that means they are basically just shaking us down and have always had the capability . 
  maybe a better approach than `` we 'll give you this if you please do this '' would be `` do this or we will do this '' as in we will apply a consequence to them . 
   we in the west are in general so rich that most of our needs are well taken care of . 
  we are rich because of our own hard work . 
   so taking care of some lesser needs ( helping others , being ethical ) becomes far more important . 
  a country is n't a charity . 
   yes , english is my second language , but do n't pretend like that has anything to do with the argument expect that you want to insult me . 
  i asked that because it did n't seem like you 're understanding me properly . 
   i straight up said that i do n't think there ` is financial gain in it for the eu ' , so i do n't know which one of us has trouble with reading comprehension . 
  then for me , there is no reason to do it . 
   neither is there any acute financial gain in keeping the elderly alive and well . 
  we still do it . 
  well , it 's not free - they paid for it their entire lives . 
   oh and lastly , the polls about england leaving the eu might be 50/50 , but as you hopefully know , polls do n't say shit .
