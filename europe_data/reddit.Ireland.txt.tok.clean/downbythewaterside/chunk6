  look at the betting odds . 
  we will see at the referendum . 
  honestly more and more mishaps by the eu are very good for me . 
  also , i do n't live in england - i live in the uk , northern ireland actually . 
  england is just one of the constituent nations of the uk - england , scotland , wales , and northern ireland . 
  so would you say that a solution would be to perhaps make it easier for working mums ? 
  if it overwhelmingly served national interest and winning was very likely i would support it , yes . 
  you 're the one whining , and giving emotional appeals . 
   the only thing your argument is based around is `` we do n't have to help them '' . 
  i have heard nothing more substantial than that from you , everything else was a bunch of bar talk and nothing else . 
  is english your second language ? 
  my argument was simply - show me the economic benefit . 
  that 's all i am concerned about . 
   but i say we want to help them . 
  because we are humans . 
  it is in our nature to help others in need . 
  is it ? 
  because historically humans have been one of the most self-serving of all the species . 
   and even if parts of the population gets rilled up by right wing extremists that use an issue to spread their propaganda to the masses , and the polls start showing that a majority does n't want to help , i can tell you that looking back in 15 years , we will be disgusted how miniscule amounts of money kept us from saving millions if we close the borders . 
  `` it 's all propaganda and you 're all wrong ! '', 
  honestly , most people wo n't even think enough about it to be disgusted and if they do think about it , they wo n't care . 
  international law puts no lower limit . 
  they could say that they 're done at 10 . 
  there is no obligation to unlimited asylum . 
   yes , refugees is an important topic for me , and i think the general attitude that a lot of people have towards them is absolutly disgusting . 
  more emotions - cry me a river . 
  emotions are meaningless . 
  they can not be quantifiable . 
   nothing wrong with having an opinion . 
  no there is n't . 
   and if one side is 40/60 and the other is 80/20 it still results in a majority , and as britain decided to be part of the eu , and still wants it , you now got ta pay your dues . 
  i really want the eu to go full on with immigration and open borders , just like how i 'm loving corbyn being labour leader . 
  it is not what i agree with but the extremism is great for me politically . 
  thanks, 
  i 'm not , they 're being deleted by the mods and i 've complained . 
  they 're still there in my history . 
   ** poll finds less than 50 % of voters in uk , ** france and netherlands are in favour of sharing out refugees , compared with 80 % of germans and italians top of the page  and yes , vote for out , that is your right , but just so you know , it wo n't happen , it 's actually up in the air - the polls are about equal . 
  some more gaffes by brussels and the idea of 75m turks getting freedom of movement will probably push it over the edge . 
   as again , britain is a democracy the mother of parliamentary democracy and we are very proud . 
   and nobody gives a fuck about you ( and yes , i can also source you that if you want ) i 'm sure that most people in this country have n't any idea who i am . 
  however you seem quite angry and emotional , did i hit a nerve ? 
   i already told you what benefits me can that be measured ? 
  if so it 's irrelevant . 
  i want data on how it benefits as a whole . 
   there is nothing emotional about a completely plausible scenario where you are bleeding out . 
  what 's not possible is the other person telling you to fuck off and die , instead of calling an ambulance . 
  you 're right it 's not emotional if someone is bleeding out and i would n't fault you if you were late for work and could n't call 999 . 
  i not opposed to doing something that does n't inconvenience me in anyway but once it becomes an inconvenience you have to measure if empirically it is a benefit . 
   refugee crisis is the same scenario at a larger level . 
  and yet there are morons who think it 's okay to tell people to fuck off and die . 
  you are obviously too thick to understand that . 
  i am done here . 
  if there is a net negative to helping then i perfectly prepared to stop at the minimum legal obligation - i do n't want these people to die or be unsafe but if helping them will negatively affect the country in a quantifiable way i am prepared to let that happen . 
   it 's a fact that you or anyone else would cry like a little bitch if you were on the other side of crisis , not an emotion . 
  i would probably cry , but you still have no obligation to help me . 
  more emotions and personal attacks - that 's usually the mark of someone who has nothing to say . 
   you talk about we and us and think just because you have your opinion that you are on the right side and everybody is agreeing with you . 
  and that is simply not true . 
  look at some polls . 
  look at some polls from yougov or pew about european attitudes to migration . 
   educate yourself a bit . 
  i would give you a similar reccomendation . 
   the majority of the eu want to take in war refugees , source ? 
  because polls have show that attitudes to immigration are negative throughout europe with the exception of sweden and germany . 
  my country - the uk - is the most negative to the point where polls show that a full majority want a stop to immigration , this is not my position because i am more than happy to welcome skilled workers who will grow the economy . 
   and just because you are a selfish i 'm just sensible  ** and some ** on reddit agree and upvote you does n't mean that your way is the way our politicians should act . 
  alternatively , just because you base your entire premise on how you feel does n't mean that 's how politicians should act . 
   and the eu does acts of charity all the time , and i am happy to pay taxes for it . 
  yes , i agree that the eu is useless and has had a net negative affect . 
   and so are , again , most people . 
  source ? 
   if you do n't like it , move to syria , i am sure things like democracy and will of the people or western values do n't matter over there . 
  i 'll just vote out in the brexit referendum . 
  thanks though !, 
  i 've always wanted to see syria , i 'm a big nerd about history and there is lots there . 
  a much better comparison would be : if i passed a beggar on the street who looked to be in need would i give him 10p ? 
  no , i would not . 
  the societies we have built are based on good governance , sensibility and economic stability . 
  you 're the one spamming emotional appeals when it is a fact that emotions ca n't be measured . 
  they 're different for everyone . 
  all that can be measured are things that are objective . 
  feelings can not be measured in any meaningful way that is accepted by everyone , economics , and infrastructure can . 
  you 're entitled to that opinion , but i will bet money on it that if you did poll in my country the uk that people will be against it . 
  and although i 'm not entirely sure i am quite sure that if you polled the continent taking more would not be a majority opinion . 
  attitudes to immigrants across the eu are more negative than positive according to polls . 
  there is no effort involved in calling 999 on your mobile phone . 
  completely terrible comparison . 
  none of this is about emotion at all . 
  there is such a thing as an objectively good economy , and affectively good infrastructure . 
  happiness is subjective , ethics are subjective , morals are subjective . 
  economic growth is objective . 
  listen , my friend you keep appealing to emotion - and it does n't work , i 'm an incredibly cold , heartless and business minded individual . 
  all i want is numbers , numbers are what is real equally to all people . 
  we can argue about right and wrong all day but it 's meaningless - all i want is numbers and you have failed to provide that so you 've lost the argument and we are done . 
  have a great day . 
  i do n't trust rt since it is the putin propaganda machine and i do n't trust the a daily sabah because it is erdogan 's propaganda machine . 
  they 're taking advantage of the fact that european governments for the most part function purely on emotional appeals . 
  i 'm talking purely about money . 
  i would rather the money not be spent full stop , but if the money must be spent i would rather it be spent on something that could directly benefit uk citizens . 
  i ca n't even debate with you when i 'm talking about infrastructure and you 're talking about gross domestic happiness and comparing not taking refugees to slavery .
