  do you see ? 
  to impose the german constitution on other countries who have not agreed to the german constitution ? 
  you 're correct - wealth is the finite resource . 
  if you print more money there will just be inflation but the amount of wealth will stay the same . 
  well why is the german government imposing its constitutional dictats onto the rest of europe in the name of solidarity ? 
  i 'm saying that if the money is going to be used anyhow , i would rather it be used to benefit us !, 
   how fucking callous . 
  this is n't like paying tax , the must here is n't a legalistic must but a moral must - analogous with `` we must not diddle children . '', 
  assisting syrian refugees is a european and american moral imperative for a number of reasons , not the least of which being that allowing the crisis to persist while having the ability to alleviate it is cowardly and criminal . 
  calling it a `` burden we do n't need '' ignores the fact that burdens exist outside of need - burdens happen regardless . 
  this burden wo n't go away if you ignore it . 
  you 're giving an emotional argument here , and emotions are never a good way to run a country or an economy . 
  so again , how can this benefit us ? 
   unhcr estimates from july number refugees at around 4 million and idps at around 7 million . 
  how is this our concern is what i 'm asking ? 
  why should we feel an obligation to help them ? 
  why is n't this being treated as it should be treated - like charity where ** taking one family ** is something we are doing out of goodness and should be enough if we say it 's enough . 
   economic or political discomfort in europe , or here in america , is not a greater evil than the fate that awaits the ignored refugees . 
  so what you are saying is that we should priortise our needs second even though our government 's job is to put our needs first ? 
  we elect governments to further ** our best interests ** . 
   ukip , sd , fn and the nl do n't have a welfare platform in their manifesto 's . 
  i do n't know who the nl is first off . 
  secondly , the fn and the sd both have economic platforms that are well left of centre - fn 's economic platform has been called comparable to the communists by manuel valls for instance . 
  ukip is an economically capitalist party that believes in a small state , as do i. i am not a big fan of the all encompassing welfare culture - * but if we are going to spend the money on helping people i think the priority should be to help our own european people * . 
  please tell me , why has the refugee debate in the first place been treated as * something we must do * ? 
  why has ` how can this benefit us financially ' never been part of the debate - because that 's how i frame my political views , how can this benefit ** us ** ? 
   the other european nations are foreigners as well . 
  yes , but they 're part of the eu - thus we have obligations to them as we are tied together . 
   we are not talking about having to do it but about this being benefitial in the end . 
  oh , come off it !, 
  the entire refugee crisis has been framed as something * we must do * . 
  i mean , i 'm against the unilateral annexation of the crimea but let 's be honest here - the ukraine is just as corrupt as russia if not more and the reason their lights are out is because of actions taken by the ukrainian government if i 'm not mistaken . 
  let 's not pretend their qol would be significantly better if they were governed from kiev and not moscow . 
  if they take you in it is ? 
  no , what i am saying is that taking any refugee should be recognised as something we are doing out of goodness not an * imperative * and that is not something that is happening . 
  let 's talk about how taking them benefits us , shall we ? 
  a nation is not a charity . 
   this does not matter ? 
  so , european solidarity only extends to foreigners ? 
   actually your other argumentation string indicates that you are entirely opposed to taking in refugees . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  i 'm opposed to it being treated as something * we must do * as opposed to something completely voluntary that we are doing as charity . 
   if you are consequent in your way of thinking , every refugee takes money that you could ` use to feed your poor ' ( even though you should know that you would n't do it even if you had the money for it ) . 
  this is a governmental problem absolutely , more of the budget needs to be allocated towards these things . 
  personally i would rather help hungry greeks than hungry refugees . 
  we can help both but the hungry greeks ( or brits , or spaniards etc ) should come way before and i 'm not seeing that . 
   500k for the entire union is not 0.1 % of the entire population . 
  financially , it 's a ** burden we do n't need ** . 
   do yo ureally think this is too much ? 
  5000 is too much , because this is an act of charity !, 
  it 's too much whenever we say it 's too much !, 
  does nobody understand this ? 
  why is this being treated like paying tax , something * we must do * ? 
   turkey , the country you want the refugees to stay in , has already taken in over 3 million . 
  yes , and ? 
  it is not our fault they were careless and overburdened themselves . 
  they are perfectly capable of closing their own border if they did n't want anymore , as evidenced in kobane . 
  oh , i see - so it 's the german tendency to be sensible about things and they wind up waiting too long . 
   actually it 's not much money , especially not for the whole eu given a joint gdp of over 17 trillion dollars . 
  it looks way more than it is . 
  it is like a third of german surplus . 
  money certainly is n't the problem . 
  and yet , we still have countries in the eu in economic shambles . 
   i had the feeling you were implying that . 
  the argument is nonensual as not accepting refugees does not improve the situation for the poor significantly well , i will repeat again - money is not finite . 
  if we 've enough money to do this then perhaps instead we should take a lesser burden and divert that money house our own homeless , feed our own hungry . 
  additionally , in the uk 3/4 of new jobs created since 1997 have gone to foreign born people so it is more competition for low skilled workers . 
  i 'm not opposed to taking refugees , i 'm opposed to the numbers . 
  this is all an exercise in charity , not some paramount obligation and it 's about time people stopped treating it like it was . 
   it is not . 
  you can talk about ` much too high ' when you get swedens or germany 's levels , but certainly not 500k for the whole eu . 
  personally any more entries at this point is * too high * , we are taking refugees out of our good will at this point . 
   not really . 
  let 's generously say that each person at baseline will cost $ 10k per year to take care of , multiplied by 500k that 's ** $ 5,000,000,000 ** . 
  that 's quite a lot of money especially when our own member states are struggling - perhaps we should use some of that instead to help flailing states like greece or portugal . 
  you know , that * european solidarity * everyone speaks about ? 
   nobody talks about cutting benefits for them for the sake of supporting refugees . 
  dont fool yourself - the payments to these people would stay the same , no matter whether there are refugees or not . 
  did i say that ? 
  i do n't think i said that . 
  what i was trying to convey is that ** money is a finite resource ** and it could be better used to ** assist our own struggling more ** . 
  any money used on refugees is ** less money to help our poor ** . 
  okay ? 
  that is still an unnecessary burden - it 's much too high . 
  i was thinking more along the lines of 200k full stop and then we take no more . 
  500k is quite a lot to feed , house , educate , police , provide healthcare to etc. 
  especially since we 've some of our own people to take care of who are in desperate poverty . 
  this is a proper decision in my opinion . 
  many people in iraq and syria need help but the christians of iraq especially face a special kind of threat - as their entire ethnoreligious community lives with the real possibility of extermination . 
  yes , i am definitely more comfortable with resettling refugees from camps that way we can assure that we get genuine refugees , prioritise women/children/families and oppressed minorities , and be able to do the proper security checks . 
  my country is doing it this way and it is a much better option . 
  * however * , i and many others want the numbers controlled and 500k is much too high . 
   ** for all we know ** this is a one time resettlement this is precisely the issue for me and why i am no longer comfortable with the european union . 
  these are huge decisions that need a degree of certainty attached to them and a person to hold accountable . 
  of course it is !, 
  at least in countries with a well functioning police service like europe and the united states , that way they have your information on file if you ever commit another crime !, 
  this deal is pointless then . 
  why pay turkey large sums of money , and give them access to the schengen area in exchange for controlling migrant movement if you 're going to let the same approximate amount of migrants in that would have came anyway ? 
  but , what i am asking is - * why * do n't germans want to have kids when british people , french people etc. 
  you ca n't say it 's the economy like in an eastern european country , so what is it with german culture that leads to such low fertility ?
