cue the knee-jerk response of those who 'll try to defend this kind of discrimination : `` it 's not racism if it 's based on nationality . '', 
  i do n't understand your argument . 
  yes , those countries have reservations about european integration , but free movement of labour across the eu is very much a reality for them . 
  free movement of labour [ also applies to the eea countries ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catid=457 ) ( norway etc. ), 
  his/her argument that eurosceptics are thick may be offensive , but the fact that the economic benefits of immigration do n't weigh into the debate suggests that many people are uninformed . 
  i should also add that the fact that eu immigrants are net contributors to the uk 's public finances has been known for a while but often gets brushed aside by the eurosceptic crowd . 
  farage has a phrase along the lines of `` we 'd rather be slightly less well off '' out of the eu with fewer migrants . 
  i 've never seen the term brainwashed zombies or anything that extreme in the spanish press and i read it regularly . 
  i have seen the spanish press talk about radicalism in catalonia , that the independence movement is a reaction against austerity and that it is promising things that are n't realistic . 
  i think the radicalism claim is crap but there 's some truth in the last two claims . 
  almost all the foreign press makes the same point about austerity and there 's also a [ strong correlation between support for independence and the crisis . 
  ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_independence#/image/file:modelcatala0611.png ) there 's also some truth to the fact that some claims about independence do n't really match what an independent catalonia would look like . 
  junqueras has said that independence will make catalan society more equal and mas more prosperous . 
  sadly , if catalonia became independent tomorrow and stated in the euro , it would still face the same problems and limited options that the spanish government facing now : an overvalued currency , high unemployment and very high debt . 
  catalonia is the most indebted community in spain after all . 
  the only options it would have would be accept economic policies that nobody really voted for . 
  for the record , i 'm in favour of you guys deciding your future and i hope you vote on the 9th . 
  about five-sixths ireland has been self-governing since 1922 , a republic since 1937 and out of the commonwealth since 1949 . 
  he either made a big mistake or was completely ignorant of even the most basic facts about ireland . 
  if it 's not propaganda , it 's seriously biased reporting . 
  troll much ? 
  the economist published an article [ here ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21627666-britons-views-immigration-are-perplexing-blend-myth-and-reality-melting-pot ) that made the same point . 
  there does seem to be a big disconnect between the facts and how immigration from the rest of the eu is perceived . 
  you do n't understand . 
  the british political class only like to be members of organisations that they can dominate or where they feel like a superpower . 
  they seem oblivious to the fact that the united kingdom is in itself a union of nations dominated by the large and prosperous england . 
  ukip and the conservatives , who draw an overwhelming amount of their support from england , should be aware of the irony of complaining about being in a union where they ca n't have their voice heard . 
  as for feeling like a superpower , i think that partly explains why the british political class emphasise the importance of the anglo-american alliance and being the us ' number one ally . 
  agree with it or not , they believe britain 's role in the world is projected by allying closely with the us . 
  strangely , they do n't see britain 's role being projected when britain works closely with its european partners , even though it does so in other organisations ( see nato , council of europe and the osce ) . 
  ** edit ** i should also say that given the border we share with them and that they are one of our main trade partners , we 'd definitely feel the impact of britain leaving . 
  cheers for that . 
  thank you for filling me in . 
  is that supposed to be rocky that putin is knocking out in [ this picture ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/keskqnh.jpg ) it reminds me of [ rocky iv , a classic piece of american cold war propaganda . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thncazypy_e ) perhaps putin 's fans are still bitter about it ? 
  it does n't matter how much evidence you have , the putinbots ( and rt ) will deny everything . 
  what 's to say these were russians and not some false flag operation ? 
  maybe these pilots are simply getting lost ? 
  or if they were russians , it must be a result of cia mind control . 
  i just checked rt 's website and i did n't see anything at all about it ( i may be wrong but i imagine other russian media outlets are similar ) . 
  russian media outlets ignoring an issue very important to russian current affairs is a pro-kremlin posture in itself . 
  in case any of you get trapped behind a paywall : -- ** we are trapped in a cycle of credit booms ** * martin wolf * * the eurozone seems to be waiting for the godot of global demand to float it off into debt sustainability . 
  * huge expansions in credit followed by crises and attempts to manage the aftermath have become a feature of the world economy . 
  today the us and uk may be escaping from the crises that hit seven years ago . 
  but the eurozone is mired in post-crisis stagnation and china is struggling with the debt it built up in its attempt to offset the loss of export earnings after the crisis hit in 2008 . 
  without an unsustainable credit boom somewhere , the world economy seems incapable of generating growth in demand sufficient to absorb potential supply . 
  it looks like a law of the conservation of credit booms . 
  consider the past quarter century : a credit boom in japan that collapsed after 1990 ; a credit boom in asian emerging economies that collapsed in 1997 ; a credit boom in the north atlantic economies that collapsed after 2007 ; and finally in china . 
  each is greeted as a new era of prosperity , to collapse into crisis and post-crisis malaise . 
  the authors of a fascinating new report , deleveraging : what deleveraging ? , do not entertain my dystopian hypothesis . 
  rightly or wrongly , they consider these credit cycles to be essentially independent events . 
  yet the report is invaluable . 
  it brings out clearly the limited nature of post-crisis deleveraging , the plight of the eurozone and the big challenges now facing china . 
  if you look at the world as a whole , there has been no aggregate deleveraging since 2008 . 
  the same holds for the high-income economies , viewed as a single bloc . 
  financial sectors have deleveraged in the us and uk , however ; so , too , have households in the us and , to a lesser degree , the uk . 
  liabilities of households have even converged between the us and the eurozone as a whole ( see charts ) . 
  meanwhile , public debt has risen sharply . 
  that financial crises lead to jumps in fiscal deficits was one of the most important findings of this time is different by harvard 's kenneth rogoff and carmen reinhart . 
  since the crisis , the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product has jumped by 46 percentage points in the uk and 40 points in the us , against 26 points in the eurozone . 
  even in the us , where private deleveraging has been rapid , overall deleveraging has been small . 
  this need be no disaster : if the government 's balance sheet is more robust than those of much of the private sector , it ought to take the strain . 
  since 2007 the ratio of total debt , excluding the financial sector , has jumped by 72 percentage points in china , to 220 per cent of gdp . 
  one can debate whether this level is sustainable . 
  one can not debate whether such a rapid rate of rise is sustainable ; it can not possibly be so . 
  the rise in debt has to halt with possibly significantly more adverse effects on china 's rate of growth than today 's consensus expects . 
  credit cycles matter because they frequently prove so damaging . 
  the report divides possible outcomes into three categories : in `` type 1 '' , such as sweden in the early 1990s , the level of output falls , never to regain its pre-crisis trend , but the growth rate recovers ; in the more damaging `` type 2 '' , as in japan since the 1990s , there is no absolute fall in output , but potential growth falls far short of the pre-crisis rate ; finally , in `` type 3 '' , as in the eurozone now and probably the us and uk , there is both a fall in output and a permanent fall in potential growth . 
  several possible reasons exist for such permanent losses of output and growth . 
  one is the pre-crisis trend was unsustainable . 
  another is the damage to confidence and so investment and innovation from a financial crisis . 
  but among the most important is the debt overhang . 
  as the report shows , deleveraging is hard . 
  mass bankruptcy , as in the 1930s , is devastating . 
  but working out of debt is likely to generate a vicious circle from high debt to low growth and back to even higher debt . 
  today long-term interest rates are low in high-income economies . 
  in the eurozone this is largely due to the promise by mario draghi , the european central bank president , in july 2012 to do `` whatever it takes '' . 
  unfortunately , the growth of nominal gdp in the eurozone is also dismal : inflation is ultra-low and real gdp is growing weakly , under the blows of fiscal retrenchment and structurally inadequate private demand . 
  incredibly , the eurozone seems to be waiting for the godot of global demand to float it off into growth and so debt sustainability . 
  that might work for the small countries . 
  it is not going to work for all of them . 
  the report talks of a `` poisonous combination . 
  between high and higher debt and slow and slowing ( both nominal and real ) gdp growth '' . 
  the euro periphery , it adds , is where this perverse loop of debt and growth is severe . 
  that is no surprise . 
  crisis-hit eurozone countries have been running to go backwards . 
  the policies of the eurozone rule out needed growth . 
  managing the post-crisis predicament requires a combination of prompt recognition of losses , recapitalisation of the banking sector and strongly supportive fiscal and monetary policies ( where those are feasible ) to sustain economic growth . 
  the aim should be to use both blades of the scissors : direct debt reduction and recapitalisation on the one hand and strong economic growth on the other . 
  the us has come closest to getting this combination right . 
  yet the biggest lesson of these crises is not to let debt run ahead of the long-term capacity of an economy to support it in the first place . 
  the hope is that macroprudential policy will achieve this outcome . 
  well , one can always hope . 
  these credit booms did not come out of nowhere . 
  they are the outcome of the policies adopted to sustain demand as previous bubbles collapsed , usually elsewhere in the world economy . 
  that is what has happened to china . 
  we need to escape from this grim and apparently relentless cycle . 
  but for now , we have made a faustian bargain with private sector-driven credit booms . 
  a great deal more trouble surely lies ahead .
