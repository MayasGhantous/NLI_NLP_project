  sorry , just a few clarifications . 
  fianna f\u00e1il are not in the s&d grouping in the european parliament but in alde ( the alliance of liberals and democrats ) . 
  it 's a pretty uphappy situation for fianna fail as they would like to be in the epp . 
  secondly , fianna fail is a classic `` catch-all '' party , so it is more populist than fine gael . 
  dude , there 's the socialist party , the people before profit and some minor ones that do n't have representation in the dail . 
  there might not be candidates from those parties standing in your area though . 
  finally , there are also nationalist parties that pull a portion of the left-wing vote like sinn f\u00e9in but i 'd encourage you not to vote for them . 
  true , but it will not get reported or even discussed on many parts of the public sphere in russia . 
  internet penetration is 54 percent according to wikipedia , so the fact that it wont be even discussed in radio or tv matters a lot . 
  i think there 's a fundamental difference between the two examples . 
  snowden was not a public representative of the russian people asking a question to the head of another institution . 
  what sen. wyden did was admirable but also part of his job as the people 's representative ( holding other institutions to account and asking probing questions ) . 
  snowden appearing on this tv programme was ( presumably ) of his own free will . 
  it was neither required of him nor expected from him . 
  lastly , whether he intended to or not , his question seems to have served putin 's rhetoric pretty well . 
  why do you guys behave differently in germany ? 
  my local supermarket blockaded the alcohol section with stacks of toilet rolls . 
  apparently , they are forcing us to be good !, 
  either way , every time i have sat down to eat a raclette , i 've gotten up much , much heavier . 
  bravo to whatever nation invented it !, 
  that does n't change anything about the huge number of russian forces just over the border . 
  this is n't much of a compromise if russia is still poised to invade within a matter of hours of the order being given . 
  ** edit ** i should also add that since russia has been denying its role so far in eastern ukraine , i find it 's commitment not to interfere very suspect . 
  russia has shown how easily it can destabilise ukraine and appears to have got away without tougher sanctions . 
  why would putin or his successors back away from this strategy in the future given how well it has worked for them ? 
  you 're right . 
  but on the other hand , in 2014 countries do n't unilaterally annex parts of their neighbours anymore . 
   unemployment , now standing at almost 26 % , will take a decade to fall substantially . 
  that comment was made in passing in the article but should have been the headline !, 
  the unemployment rate is probably the most important measure of spain 's recovery , particularly given how high it is . 
  spain does n't have a decade for these problems to correct themselves and neither does europe . 
  such high numbers of unemployment are simply unacceptable and , more importantly , * unsustainable . 
  * in my opinion , we should fear for the eurozone if policy makers are willing to accept such high unemployment for the next decade . 
  it will eventually create so much discontent that people will seriously consider abandoning the euro rather than to maintain this agonising process of internal devaluation and prolonged stagnation . 
  ask yourselves , what are the unemployed supposed to do during this decade ? 
  join the hundreds of thousands who have already left ? 
  what about the people who have lost their jobs in their 50s when nobody will hire them again ? 
  or the young people who ca n't get enough experience to get a job ? 
  i could keep going adding more to the number of problems that this prolonged stagnation is causing , but quite frankly it provides depressing enough reading as it is . 
  you 're right in a sense that all news channels are biased in what they cover and how they cover it . 
  but there is a distinction between bias and propaganda . 
  with regards russia today , it has not been objective since the crisis started in ukraine . 
  amongst many other reasons , the fact that they used the term `` self-defence forces '' without quotation marks makes me put them in the latter category of propaganda . 
  jokes aside , i 'm sure russia would be very unhappy at the prospect of an international peacekeeping force being present in the east of ukraine as it simply goes against their interest . 
  for one thing it would undermine russia 's ( already weak ) justification of its military build up just over the border . 
  secondly , such an international force would place russia 's role in destabilising ukraine under much more scrutiny so long as it had a mandate . 
  however , given that russia is a permanent member of the security council , i suspect that if such a mission goes forward it will be very small and wo n't be made up of forces from nato countries . 
  sorry but i ca n't take dan hannan seriously . 
  for one thing , his stance on the [ nhs is so outlandish and absurd . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fisprkq28iu ) given that it contributed to the opposition on the right to obamacare in the us , he did a whole lot of american people an immense disservice . 
  secondly , [ this was his reaction to the abolishment of roaming charges in the eu . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/danhannanmep/status/451664593300258816 ) is he that oblivious to the fact that working class people in the eu travel to other countries as well ? 
  they will also be the ones to benefit from this change whenever they go on holiday . 
  can you explain what these people are protesting about ? 
  for example , are they supporting russia 's actions in ukraine ? 
  or are they seeking to become part of russia ? 
  why ? 
  discussion of brexit and british politics is very relevant to / r/europe in my opinion . 
  personally , i care because friends and family live in the uk . 
  but ultimately it 's a choice british people alone will have to make and as an irishman i have to accept it . 
  my hope is that people inform themselves about it and that whatever the outcome , this will close a chapter on the issue . 
  yes , switzerland is a major financial centre , but it faces [ significant challenges being outside the eu , ] ( http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/business/economic-research-and-information/research-publications/documents/research-2013/switzerlands-approach-to-eu-engagement.pdf ) says none other than the * city of london . 
  * you can dismiss the findings of the article above , along with the reports from whitehall and what the city of london says , but you 'd be better off taking this into consideration . 
  most notably , switzerland has to implement legislation to maintain its access to the single market that it has no say over . 
  i agree with you but i 'd also like to add one point . 
  if a left wing candidate ( or party ) argued against big business as [ farage has done , ] ( http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26854894 ) the british newspapers ( and murdoch ) would be at them non-stop . 
  bizarrely , farage remains their darling , but how long until big business ' interest weighs against him is unclear . 
  ** edit ** in an [ interview ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnp61fksmvc ) with the financial times , farage argued that british businesses were split 50:50 on brexit . 
  he did n't provide any source for that , but looking at this i would argue that that 's not true . 
  some of the people in question are asylum seekers . 
  there is a difference between them and illegal immigrants . 
  my apologies , i did n't mean to cause any offence to anybody with my comment . 
  what i meant to say was that i hoped that dialogue between would be possible . 
  sorry about that . 
  there i was thinking we might be moving to a de-escalation . 
  i do n't know what you mean but there does seem to be a lot of whataboutism on this thread . 
  to be honest , while the million people who died deserve to be remembered , there are other reasons not to attend these commemorations . 
  kagame repeatedly refers to the genocide as ( in my opinion ) as it plays on the guilt of western countries and helps distract from what he is currently doing . 
  the genocide ended , but since then rwanda ( under kagame ) has [ invaded foreign countries ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_congo_war ) , supported [ rebel groups ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/m23_rebellion ) and [ carried out assassinations of the regime 's opponents . 
  ] ( http://ewn.mobi/news/local/karegeya-s-murder-was-ordered-by-kagame/15962 ) ** edit ** i just checked le monde . 
  apparently the french ambassador will be there , so this story really is n't as big as it seems . 
  very well put . 
  russia today loves to focus on discontent in the west , from rioting to anti-austerity protests . 
  but when similar scenes of discontent a happen in russia , they 'll be happy to extensively cover the kremlin-organised counter-demonstrations as well . 
  lavrov is calling for more moderate rhetoric . 
  before he lectures foreign leaders , he should start at russian state tv . 
  would you be able to point out who said that ( e.g. 
  barroso , schulz or van rompuy ) ? 
  they are the presidents of the eu 's main institutions , but there is no * one * president of the eu . 
  i support the right of the catalans to decide their future . 
  but i also will state that these are not normal times , with levels of debt and unemployment in spain that are almost surreal . 
  so i can understand the spanish government 's view on the issue . 
  my fear for the catalan people is that even if they get peaceful independence , it might be a lot less rosy than they hoped for . 
  they will probably be forced to pick up some of the national debt and maintain some of the policies that are creating this mess . 
  i 'm on my phone so i ca n't provide a longer response . 
  in my opinion human rights ca n't be enforced solely on a national level . 
  case and point , in ireland the supreme court saw no problem in upholding a ban on homosexuality ( more specifically homosexual acts ) , despite that being a clear infringement of people 's right to privacy . 
  that only changed without the echr 's ruling on the issue in norris v. ireland . 
  honestly , do the british people also want to withdraw from the european convention of human rights , the european convention on refugees and the echr as ukip wants ? 
  i 'm curious as to where this argument as to `` regaining full sovereignty '' ends ?
