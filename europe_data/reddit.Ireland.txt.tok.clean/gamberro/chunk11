  this guy seems like a russian version of glenn beck . 
  both are overweight , greying and crazy conspiracy theorists . 
  ** edit ** on another note , both beck and kiselev are also highly , highly prejudiced . 
  but i would find it equally depressing if glenn beck was considered america 's `` second most respected and authoritative journalist . '', 
  i know valencia , the balearic islands and catalonia have different histories ( as well as cultures ) but i am confused as to why support for independence varies so much between them . 
  many catalans refer to the desire to protect their language ( and culture ) as a reason to break away from spain . 
  but their language is not exclusive to catalonia and surely the desire to protect it is equally shared in valencia/balearic islands . 
  in my opinion , if these catalan speaking regions collaborated together , they would be more successful in protecting it from perceived threats . 
  i assume you know catalan very well since you are from valencia . 
  so can i ask what are ( of there are any ) the main threats to the language/culture ? 
  i stumbled upon [ this article in the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/23/catalan-language-in-danger ) , but the author does n't cite a single study or statistic . 
  my apologies . 
  despite reading the article before sharing it , i had n't checked the date . 
  sorry about that . 
  here 's a breakdown of the un general assembly vote ( 168 members were present out of 193 un member states ) : 100 votes in favour , 58 abstentions and 11 votes against . 
  the eleven countries that voted against the resolution were the following : * russia * armenia * belarus * bolivia * cuba * north korea * nicaragua * sudan * syria * venezuela * zimbabwe ** edit ** updated the figures . 
  do you mean turks in syria have been attacked or that turkey has been attacked from syria ? 
  i know there was an incident when a turkish f4 plane was shot down , but this must be something else . 
  oh god , gandia shore !, 
  i could n't believe it the first time i saw it . 
  where on earth do they find such people ? 
  ( un ) fortunately , the uk has its own version called geordie shore . 
  i admit i did n't know who he was initially and to be honest i do n't care for his neocon politics . 
  but at least this report is based on his investigation on the ground in the ukraine , interviewing jewish groups etc. 
  furthermore most of the facts ( especially regarding public statements by the community ) can be corroborated elsewhere . 
  not at all , it 's worthy of it . 
  the 75 percent of laws does appear like [ a pretty suspect claim . 
  ] ( http://www.jcm.org.uk/blog/2009/06/what-percentage-of-laws-come-from-the-eu/ ) it 's based on a speech made by the former european parliament president hans-gert pottering . 
  apparently what he was actually saying was that the european parliament legislates on 75 percent of laws passed by the eu . 
  the [ ukip video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmk-f88gcx8 ) making this claim also conveniently cuts out the context of pottering 's statement . 
  also , what kind of party cites a figure/statistic made in a speech , rather than in a report/study ? 
  no offense to mr. pottering 's character , but politicians are known to [ make up figures . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/01/david-cameron-rebuked-over-debt-claims ) what 's even worse is that farage has repeated this over and over again , regardless of the fact that it 's baseless . 
  interesting . 
  do you think the economic crisis has impacted on people 's views on independence in euskadi ? 
  this is an honest question and i do n't mean to cause any offence by it . 
  the reason why i ask is that from what i 've read from catalonia , people believe that they would be able to survive this crisis better if they were an independent state . 
  there is also a lot of criticism of how they give more to the central government than they receive back . 
   it should n't matter whether it is made up by 7 or 50 states . 
  but the will of those individual states is required in order to allow the eu to project power as a whole . 
  as you point out , things related to foreign policy like expansion are decided by unanimity on the council of ministers , regardless of the size of a member state . 
  with every member having a [ * liberum veto * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberum_veto ) over foreign policy issues , increasing the number of members puts this under pressure . 
  i think one solution would be to move towards qualified majority voting in these areas . 
  that would hard for many member states to accept , but without it the eu will be less than the sum of its parts ( with regards foreign policy anyway ) . 
  i fear for irish . 
  we have very few native speakers compared to other minority languages ( 130,000 compared to 720,000 for basque ) . 
  that 's about 18 percent on basque . 
  plus with all the cutbacks , i ca n't see the situation getting any better , especially regards bilingual education . 
  dude it 's cool . 
  you 're welcome here . 
  indeed , if putin wants to talk about politicians making obscene statements about minorities , then he should start at home . 
  for example , the vice-chairman of the state duma has called for [ the deportation of ukrainians to alaska ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_zhirinovsky#foreign_relations_and_military_excursions ) amongst many other things . 
  what country are you from if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  i 'm not 100 percent sure why they are either but [ here 's a rough guide on the fn . 
  ] ( http://www.craigwilly.info/2013/04/30/the-front-national-a-rough-guide/ ), 
  that article was originally published in the irish times actually , although i assume they are endorsing it . 
  i am aware that war has n't been declared in ukraine . 
  but anti-war movements have in the past also been opposed to military action , even if it 's only been proposed and no declaration of war given . 
  so i think my question still stands . 
  after all russia has used military force to occupy and subsequently annex part of another country . 
  interesting . 
  how do the fn and the parti de gauche see putin 's russia ? 
  are you referring to [ this article ? 
  ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2014/03/britain-and-ukraine ), 
  i 'm not saying i agree with it . 
  that 's just their response to date from what i 've found . 
  ** ireland ** i have only found a little bit of action from them since the crisis started , including [ this statement , ] ( http://irishantiwar.org/node/2167 ) which criticises both washington , the eu and russia . 
  the statement calls russia an `` imperial power '' , but also criticises western powers for their `` own awful bloody history . '', 
  apart from that i ca n't find any protests that have taken place ( particularly with regards the crimea ) , apart from by [ the ukrainian community in january . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/hundreds-protest-outside-ukrainian-embassy-in-dublin-1.1668603 ) ** edit ** i forgot to add [ this link of a deputy from a left wing party ] ( http://claredaly.ie/ukraine/ ) ( affiliated with the anti-war movement ) bringing up the issue in our parliament . 
  she does criticise russia 's actions , but also places a lot of the blame on eu and nato expansion . 
  * in case anybody gets stuck behind a paywall . 
  * -- hours after turkey 's increasingly jumpy government moved to block access to twitter , turkish citizens struck back -- on the social media network itself . 
  some circulated a photoshopped picture of recep tayyip erdogan. , prime minister , sinking his teeth into the cartoonish blue bird that serves as the network 's mascot . 
  they were far from alone : the number of tweets sent after the midnight ban increased by about 140 per cent over normal levels , according to data provided by analytics company brandwatch . 
  twitter itself sent out mobile numbers that allowed turkish consumers to keep using its service . 
  in a tweet from its policy team , the company said : `` we stand with our users in turkey who rely on twitter as a vital communications platform . 
  we hope to have full access returned soon . '' in another technical fix against the ban , turkish downloads of hotspot shield , the world 's most popular virtual private network service , increased to 270,000 on friday -- from a daily average of 7,000 . 
  the turkish users ' defiance and the sheer scale of their activity suggest no immediate end to the battering mr erdogan has suffered in cyberspace . 
  seeking to silence allegations of corruption against him and his government in the run-up to local elections on march 30 , he has removed some 7,000 policemen from their posts and boosted ankara 's powers over judges and prosecutors . 
  but the internet has proved much harder to handle . 
  a formal corruption investigation has stalled , twitter and youtube have been used to circulate apparently incriminating voice recordings of mr erdogan and his circle -- including some he says are fake , but others he has acknowledged as authentic . 
  yet more explosive leaks are expected ahead of this month 's elections -- according to one rumour , more revelations will come on march 25 . 
  but if turkey 's twitter ban was intended to thwart the dissemination of such allegations , it has backfired spectacularly . 
  `` erdogan is constantly on the run now , i do n't think he has time to think , '' said soli ozel at kadir has university in istanbul . 
  `` he is trying to keep the scandal as muted as possible at all costs , but he ca n't control the technology . 
  instead he is fuelling the fire of suspicion and making everyone anticipate what , if anything will come out on the 25th . '' mr erdogan took aim at twitter on thursday , saying he would `` root out '' the microblogging service for national security reasons . 
  but he failed to account for his country 's predilection for social networks -- a response , many say , to a cowed local media -- which means that twitter has greater penetration among turkish internet users than in any other country in the world . 
  in a sign of the political difficulty faced by the ban , even president abdullah gul , who recently signed a bill increasing government control over the internet , took to twitter to announce his own opposition to the measure . 
  ( one fellow turkish user immediately asked him what settings he was using to access the network . ), 
  before long the european commission , the council of europe , the uk government , human rights watch , amnesty international and many other non-governmental and international organisations had all sent their own tweets deploring what they depicted as an attack on free speech . 
  in the us , the white house said it was `` deeply concerned that the turkish government has blocked its citizens ' access to basic communication tools '' . 
  in a statement it said : `` we oppose this restriction on the turkish people 's access to information , which undermines their ability to exercise freedoms of expression and association and runs contrary to the principles of open governance that are critical to democratic governance and the universal rights that the us stands for around the world . '' celebrities such as russell crowe , richard branson , mia farrow and elijah wood piled in . 
  the turkish bar association filed a criminal complaint against the ban , which it said was illegal and disproportionate . 
  as sporadic twitter service returned in parts of the country , a degree of mystery surrounded who had formally imposed the measure , supposedly in response to court complaints about invasion of privacy . 
  the government says the ban was imposed because twitter had failed to respect such court complaints ; a lawyer for twitter was in ankara for meetings on friday afternoon . 
  `` these steps are very crucial for the turkish legal system , '' said selin erciyas , at mehmet gun & partners , an istanbul law firm . 
  `` we will see if there is a true objective legal system or whether it is just erdogan that decides things in court . '', 
  there have been a few `` lucky '' breaks from anonymous sources that reveal that the russian security services are doing similar things to the nsa ( such as monitoring the phone conversations of high-ranking officials in foreign countries ) . 
  just look at the recordings of conversations that `` mysteriously '' appeared at the right moment to try and discredit what was happening in ukraine , or at least to portray it as a western plot .
