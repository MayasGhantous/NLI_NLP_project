  i 'm referring to the [ ashton-paet conversation ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/05/ukraine-bugged-call-catherine-ashton-urmas-paet ) , but also the nuland one that seemed to be conveniently leaked to cause discord between western governments . 
  two things about what you wrote . 
  snowden is not intentionally a pawn for putin and from what we 've seen from people who have interviewed him in russia , he is carrying on his operations independently . 
  however , his whistle blowing actions pretty much advance russia 's interests and particularly help with its anti-western rhetoric . 
  in that sense , he might * unintentionally * be a pawn for putin . 
  if you turn on russia today , you 'll be flooded with details on how the west is decadent and wrong in everything , with special emphasis on the nsa/prism scandal . 
  i by no means condone the nsa 's actions , but that is the result of him continuing his whistle blowing while in russia . 
  secondly , i think what he initially revealed about prism along with spying on world leaders were serious enough that his motivations leading up to that are of secondary importance . 
  he seems pretty right wing , but for me that does n't take away from what he initially revealed any more than if he were anywhere else on the political spectrum ( such as in the centre or on the far left ) . 
  what matters to me is that wikileaks and snowden only really seem interested in revealing what intelligence services in the west are doing . 
  that means they perfectly fit the interests of russian state rhetoric and propaganda . 
  we live in a multi-polar world , where countries like russia are perfectly capable of being aggressors ( see crimea ) . 
  barcelona is definitely up there for me too . 
  not only are there groups of people from all over , but it is also a thoroughly bilingual city which i love . 
  sorry , i did n't mean for that question to cause any offence as i was just curious about what 's happening . 
  i realise that it might come across as a bit of a strange question to ask , especially given the fact that i 'm not living in such a situation . 
  my apologies . 
  a question for the turkish people on this subreddit . 
  do people in turkey realise how erdogan 's actions will be seen in the rest of europe ? 
  suppressing freedom of speech like this hardly seems like to advance turkey 's foreign and economic goals . 
  secondly , if erdogan is going to ignore the opinions of international leaders , then greater integration with the european union is most likely going to be off the cards . 
  can you explain to me how new coal powered plants are going down with the electorate in germany ? 
  as far as i understand , the government is planning on building 26 new plants powered by coal . 
  i can understand nuclear power was unpopular , but i ca n't see how coal would win votes either . 
  thanks . 
  svoboda has 4 seats in 20-member government that includes ukrainians , russians , jews and armenians and is headed by a jewish ukrainian . 
  if you really think that ukraine is a fascist country ( as others here seem to believe ) , you are mistaken . 
  however , the fact that you quoted russia today as a reliable source on anything that is happening in the ukraine is very surprising . 
  this is the news agency that used the term `` self-defence forces '' without quotation marks after all . 
  i do n't want to interfere here , but can you provide me with a link to what you mean about glenn greenwald 's definition of terrorism . 
  a quick google search led me to articles about the killing of lee rigby . 
   not representative of most ukrainians , but they spoil it for everyone else . 
  i think putin has abused the argument about fascists in the ukraine to the extreme . 
  particularly when he used this argument to justify what happened in crimea . 
  but that said , i think people should see this video as such ( violent ) intimidation and coercion is a serious abuse of press freedom , wherever it happens . 
  thanks for that . 
  yes , except landlocked between moldova and ukraine . 
  i 'll admit that the transnistria case is different from that of crimea . 
  but given russia 's actions in the latter , i doubt this will go down well if they interfere in transnistria too . 
  many thanks . 
   mr putin later appeared before crowds in moscow 's red square , telling them : `` crimea and sevastopol are returning to ... their home shores , to their home port , to russia ! '', 
  he shouted `` glory to russia '' as the crowds chanted `` putin ! '', 
  can a russian speaker confirm that this is an accurate translation of what he said ? 
  i tried replacing russia with ireland and imagining our prime minister saying that , but it still seemed really creepy . 
  i find the criticism of the european court of human rights quite hard to understand , particularly as countries outside the eu are subject to it as well . 
  while its rulings may conflict with the interests of member states , those rulings at least are derived from a charter which those same member states have freely signed up to . 
  what particularly irritates me is that cameron fails to see the positive side of these institutions , including providing a permanent safety check on the actions of member states that may conflict with european standards of human rights . 
  a few notable things in my own country would not have changed without '' ~ ~ un ~ ~ necessary interference '' from the european institutions , from the [ decriminalising of homosexuality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/norris_v._ireland ) ( 1993 ) to [ allowing of abortion in limited circumstances ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a,_b_and_c_v_ireland ) ( 2013 ) . 
  both of these stemmed from rulings against ireland in the echr . 
  on a final note , i think you were spot on as it does seem like cherry picking . 
  but it also looks like a list of demands of what he wants from europe . 
  i do n't see anything he wants to give in exchange for concessions when he sits down to negotiate with his european partners , which makes me think this strategy is doomed to fail . 
  exactly !, 
  in the face of natural ( or man made ) disasters , politicians in both the us and uk have had criticism for the way they responded ( such as acting too slowly ) repeated on both the national broadcasters and private ones . 
  that was the case with regards the floods in the uk and the launch of the obamacare website . 
  if you 're not going to allow criticism of putin as rt does then you are ignoring his role in many abuses in russia ( or ones that happened under his mandate ) , from the human rights abuses in chechnya to the large corruption in the country . 
  bring on the `` self-defence forces '' with swedish license plates !, 
  interesting . 
  there 's also a city in eastern ukraine with [ welsh heritage ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donetsk ) , founded by the welsh industrialist john hughes . 
  according to wikipedia it was even named after him , as the old name yuzovka was a russian/ukrainian approximation of hughezovka . 
  many thanks . 
  i 'm curious as to what 's the situation with hungarians ( or other minorities ) in romania in dealing with regional/local authorities . 
  as far as i know in areas where ethnic minorities are over 20 percent of the population in romania , their language can be used in education . 
  but it 'd be interesting to see this other aspect of it . 
  other than that , i am seriously opposed to jobbik and any far-right groups like it . 
  out of curiosity , are you really from prc ? 
  many thanks for that . 
  well done for pointing that out . 
  [ here 's a piece ] ( http://russiancouncil.ru/en/inner/?id_4=3248&amp;active_id_11=37#top ) written by the head of the russian international affairs council that contains a similar number of oddities . 
  if you follow what he is saying there , yanukovich was overthrown in a `` violent change of power '' by `` political radicals '' who would persecute minorities in ukraine . 
  as such , russia had no choice to intervene . 
  the mind boggles . 
  just to say thank you for posting this ( and for writing similar posts many times in the past ) . 
  it clearly takes a lot of time and effort on your part , so that deserves recognition . 
  can you give us an example of russian media/government stating that they would like to reincorporate the baltics and poland ? 
  this was said in another thread by somebody much more articulate than me , but is still valid :  we might be thinking about different stasis , but the one i 'm thinking about had 300,000 informers in a country of 10 million or so , was used against political dissidents , using mass harassment campaigns and frequent arrests as a tool and it 's own prison and labour camps . 
  pardon me if this comes across as very na\u00efve , but why do n't you have a problem with everyone spying on merkel 's cellphone ? 
  i would like to know as the reaction was quite big after this was leaked . 
  i think people are particularly angry about the fact that this spying done between allies . 
  i do n't know enough about international law to comment on the kosovo secession , but the fact that russian troops are occupying crimea while a vote takes place on joining russia i think will discredit the validity of the `` plebiscite . '', 
  also i do n't know if this matters but kosovo was voting for independence , not to join another state . 
  but the language law was vetoed by the interim president . 
  i 'll give you the svoboda example , but russia 's case remains very weak . 
  is n't there a question of legitimacy with regards crimea 's right to separate ? 
  as recently as 1991 , every administrative region of the ukraine ( including crimea ) voted to separate from russia and become independent . 
  also , as others here have pointed out , under the [ constitution of 2004 ] ( http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/constitution_of_ukraine,_2004 ) , crimea can only secede if ukraine as a whole supports it . 
  exactly . 
  i admit that i am far from happy with this source , but most of the rebuttals found in the document can easily be confirmed elsewhere . 
  is anybody else wondering about how these phone calls are being leaked ? 
  is seems to me that the russian intelligence services are using this conversation ( and the victoria nuland one ) to try to discredit the protest movement and/or create discord amongst its supporters . 
  exactly . 
  i mentioned this in another thread , but rt are using the term `` self-defence forces '' without quotation marks . 
  they 're not even trying to be objective . 
  just a clarification . 
  ukraine was not offered eu membership but rather an [ association agreement . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_association_agreement ), 
  can you give us a link to the source ? 
  russia today are using the term [ `` self-defence forces '' ] ( http://rt.com/news/ukraine-crimea-photos-tweets-434/ ) ** without ** quotation marks with regards to these troops in combat gear . 
  no objectivity whatsoever there , but then i guess that should n't be expected from rt. 
  i am also curious as to the ukrainian army 's capability .
