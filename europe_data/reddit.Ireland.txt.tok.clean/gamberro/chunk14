  but i think part of the reason is that people view the `` gay propaganda '' law as a step backwards with regards lgbt rights in russia , rather than moving towards a more tolerant and equal stance . 
  i will also add that while some of the criticism of russia may seem unjust in light of other countries where homosexuality is illegal ( such as india and nigeria ) , a lot of it stems from the fact that russia is hosting the winter olympics at the moment . 
  if they were being hosted in another socially conservative country , i think the response would be similar . 
  i am giving this a downvote , not because i approve of anti-semitism but because the author does n't distinguish between anti-semitism and criticism of israel . 
  of course anti-zionism can be a mask for anti-semitism , but that does not mean all critics of israel are anti-zionist or even anti-semitic . 
  i will also add that the author seems to see europe and the united states through a very blurred lens , dismissing the [ condemnation of the toulouse attacks by the then president sarkozy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lva12c3r8kg ) and the ceremony held a year later . 
  finally , if he honestly believes that racism and racist attacks do n't exist in the united states , he is sadly mistaken . 
  maybe they want the voice of their democratically elected government to be heard in the council and that the elected representatives of the people be heard in the parliament . 
  well spotted !, 
  the plurality of forty-seven percent of respondents were in favour of scottish independence ( including myself ) . 
  perhaps some of those who are opposed to independence are in favour of the scottish people having the right to hold a referendum on it . 
  as for the case of catalonia , i think a lot of the hostility towards the independence issue is that a vote on its independence is presently unconstitutional in spain , despite the regional government 's plan to pursue it unilaterally . 
  however , catalans are entitled to campaign peacefully and democratically to have the constitution changed which is what those in favour of independence have done up to now ( to their credit ) . 
  finally , i do n't think anybody on this subreddit is seriously in favour of police brutality , wherever it happens . 
  i 'm sure many people will be unhappy with the legal advice , whatever it is . 
  but i think that it 's a positive move as at least it would clarify the situation . 
  i also went to a catholic school but i had a different experience to the poster above . 
  i do n't think the article is overblown in that sex education is quite haphazard and not standardised across all schools in the country . 
  in my experience , at around the age of 12 in primary school we had a talk about adolescence which included some information on `` where babies come from . '', 
  we covered the basics of sexual reproduction and anatomy in biology around the age of 15 . 
  but apart from that , the class where we spent most time on the subject was in religion , so as you can imagine it was neither comprehensive nor objective . 
  i 'm afraid to say we were never taught about contraception , nor stds , nor sexual orientation ( s ) nor sexual health . 
  i wish i could give you more than one upvote for the father ted reference . 
   take off your shoes when invited to someones home . 
  really ? 
  even as an adult ? 
  good to know . 
  i think that 's why people here generally do n't take `` no '' for an answer when they offer you something . 
  most of the time anyway . 
  oh and here is a sketch by a comedian who thinks that [ this is a legacy of catholicism . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2mvow3a7t8 ), 
  rule # 1 . 
  when you 're offered something , it 's considered polite to refuse it the first time round . 
  rule # 2 . 
  usually people get in a huff when you fail to apply rule # 1 and offer the thing a second time . 
  indeed , just yesterday the guardian reported that manufacturing exports have seen an [ increase in italy ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/03/greece-manufacturing-growth-january-eurozone-recovery ) and the country is currently running a current account surplus . 
  the country does face huge economic challenges but this guy does n't seem to know what he is talking about . 
  granted that with many young people unemployed , a huge amount of human capital is wasted , with many long-term effects on italy 's economy and demography . 
  but the fact that it is able to increase its exports is proof that many sectors of its economy are still dynamic and increasingly export oriented . 
  i agree . 
  also make sure that the institutions you do create are directly democratically accountable to the people ( unlike say the commission president or the president of the council ) . 
  i think there 's a big difference between criticising something ( as in pensioners criticising the government ) and actively calling for withdrawal from or the dismantling of something ( as the daily mail does with the eu ) . 
  furthermore , it depends on the type of criticism put forward by the pensioner as criticising welfare policies while at the same time benefitting from them would at least result in hypocrisy . 
  ** edit ** it 's also worth pointing out that paul dacre is on an annual salary of # 1.8 million . 
  he could live very comfortably without that money from the organisation he is so fiercely opposed to . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's the piece you 're referring to but the daily beast ran a story about this right [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/17/anti-gay-countries-love-gay-porn.html ), 
  that 's true but syria only admitted to having chemical weapons in september when it signed up to the deal to destroy them . 
  hopefully with time it will become clear who was responsible . 
  i would also add that while syria and russia may not be allies * per se * , russia has expressed strong support for the assad regime since the start of the arab spring . 
  this is the same regime that has massacred many of its own citizens in the past , such as in the 1982 hama massacre in which 20,000 people were killed . 
  the police officer starts dancing and showing off his moves . 
  i totally agree . 
  distinguishing between indentured workers and slaves is pretty important as indentured workers ( particularly from india ) ended up replacing slaves after emancipation . 
  after a fixed number of years of labour , they would be free to work on their own unlike slaves who had no guarantee of freedom . 
  for essentially racist reasons , indentured workers from tropical countries were preferred to europeans . 
  the large numbers of people of indian descent in mauritius , guyana and elsewhere are a testament to that . 
  also , the author should pay attention to the fact that many irish merchants benefitted from the transatlantic slave trade . 
  the irish were excluded from buying/selling slaves directly , but they managed to make profits by selling foodstuffs and other goods to the west indies plantations . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.newstalk.ie/slaves-sugar-and-salvation ) a podcast on the topic if anybody 's interested . 
  you 're right that countries like ireland are neutral and have a right not to intervene . 
  however , ireland has a history of participating in peacekeeping operations where these are sanctioned by a un security council mandate . 
  as recently as 2010 , ireland had troops in chad ( as part of a [ mainly french operation ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eufor_tchad/rca ) involved in maintaining law and order . 
  at least the labour government at the time assessed the possibility of joining the euro in a [ transparent and professional way ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/five_economic_tests ) , thus justifying their ultimate decision to stay out . 
  this was a strong counterweight to nay-sayers who argued that britain should join . 
  on the other hand , the conservative government has suppressed reports on the eu prepared by its own civil service on the grounds that they are [ `` too positive . 
  '' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-delays-eu-immigration-report-because-it-is-too-positive-8994264.html ) cameron is also insistent on renegotiating the uk 's membership terms , despite reports from his own civil servants indicating the balance of powers was [ `` broadly appropriate . 
  thanks to both of you for filling me in !, 
  possibly , but catalonia is in a very different economic situation at the moment than scotland is right now . 
  unemployment in catalonia is over 23 percent while in scotland it is at 7 . 
  meanwhile youth unemployment in catalonia , along with spain as a whole , is over 50 percent . 
  i think the push for independence in catalonia * now * is partially a response to the dire economic situation . 
  out of curiosity , and i hope you do n't mind me asking this , but do you think support for independence was stronger during the thatcher era than it is today ? 
   in other words what he means by pro-palestinian is anti-settlements . 
  this !, 
  he seems to be downplaying the importance of these settlements in the first place by referring to the expansion as the `` construction of a few houses '' . 
  bear in mind that building the settlements are not only a major obstacle to peace , but a [ huge violation of international law . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/israeli_settlement#legal_status ) israel 's ambassadors were summoned as israel is continuously seeking to increase its ( already large ) number of settlements in the west bank , rather than reduce them . 
  we have every right to object and quite frankly we should . 
  that 's true , but i guess it depends on whether you believe that government has a role in intervening in the free market or not , including in preventing cartels and monopolies ( or oligarchical capitalism as you put it ) . 
  [ some schools of thought ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ordoliberalism ) see such intervention as ensuring that the free market works as best as it can . 
  given farage 's background in the city of london and his desire to [ protect it from financial regulation , ] ( http://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/news-and-analysis/politics/nigel-farage-uk-has-lost-control-of-fs-regulations-to-eu/2000670.article ) i think he does not fall into the latter camp . 
  to be honest , i think he would only have a problem with the last part of that sentence ; `` big bureaucrats . '', 
  he seems to believe in freemarket capitalism , so i doubt he would really object to europe being run in the interests of big banks and big business . 
  out of curiosity , how do you feel the bbc have handled this ? 
  they generally try to be even handed about these things . 
  what the ? 
  all this over plans to simply redesign a street ? 
  limit freedom of speech ? 
  excuse me but dieudonn\u00e9 is trying to hide behind freedom of speech the entire time while saying things that , if not racist , are pretty seriously offensive . 
  but when somebody else exercises their right to freedom of speech by comparing the quenelle to a hitler salute , then dieudonn\u00e9 threatens them with litigation . 
  ** edit ** grammar, 
  she might have been referring to the former yugoslav countries but that still would not have made any sense i 'm afraid . 
  apart from slovenia and croatia none of them are in the eu nor do they benefit from free movement of labour . 
  simply put , we ca n't even think about a ` tidal wave ' from serbia , montenegro or elsewhere until these countries actually join the eu . 
  i also disagree with the term ` tidal wave ' as it seems like a pretty good example of hyperbole . 
  slovenia and croatia are now in the eu and have n't produced high levels of emigration . 
  meh , we like to claim it 's an irish film despite being entirely filmed in your country . 
  many thanks for your very thorough response . 
  do you think transnistria will ultimately secede or become part of russia ?
