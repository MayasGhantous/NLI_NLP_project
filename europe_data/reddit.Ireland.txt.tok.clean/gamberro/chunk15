  it would be pretty bizarre for russia to have a tiny piece of territory surrounded by the ukraine on one side and moldova . 
  no offence intended , i 'm genuinely curious . 
  you 're allowed to express your views and you 're entitled to vote for any party you so choose while abiding by the law in your country . 
  but that does not mean the other people on this subreddit have to respect your party choice or ideology , nor do they have to respect mine . 
  so you can drop the self-victimisation . 
  however , i will offer this critique of the front national , since you agree enough with their programme to vote for it . 
  marine le pen along with the party in general frequently accuse immigrants in france of trying to `` impose their values '' on , and change , the country . 
  but who is really trying to `` change france '' and impose their values on it ? 
  the heterogenous immigrant population in france that comes from every country in the world from vancouver to vladivostok ? 
  or the eurosceptic , [ immigrant bashing ] ( http://www.craigwilly.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fn-immigration.jpg ) , [ gay discriminating ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2013/05/19/marine-le-pen-abolirait-le-mariage-homosexuel-si-elle-etait-elue_3362899_3224.html ) , [ protectionist ] ( http://lentreprise.lexpress.fr/gestion-entreprise/renforcer-le-protectionnisme-aux-frontieres-marine-le-pen-front-national_31563.html ) , nazi apologist front national ? 
  i think andrewdraws meant that the member states combined spend 200 billion euros on defence , but correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  i think greater military integration and specialisation is a good thing , particularly amongst the countries that are more integrated as it is ( britain could obtain an opt out ) . 
  but let me clarify what i mean by integration as i think armed forces need to remain under the control of each member state . 
  by integration i mean greater harmonisation of standards , compatibility of equipment and specialisation by individual forces , which would save money while giving european countries an ability to act independently of the united states . 
  yes , but the ecb is quite reluctant to stray from its mandate . 
  as late as 2010 the ecb raised interest rates twice in order to fulfil its mandate of keeping inflation below its target of 2 % . 
  this was despite the fact that many countries like greece , italy and even ireland were already struggling to pay their debts . 
  as the article points out , the ecb has already lowered interest rates to 0.25 % in order to try and stimulate demand . 
  but for such a policy to work it requires more spending from the `` core '' countries , which have so far been reluctant to do so . 
  one last point to bare in mind is about the strengthening of the euro . 
  since the crisis began , countries like ireland and spain have managed to [ reverse their current account deficits ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/current-account ) by focusing on exports in the face of collapsing demand at home . 
  a strengthening euro makes makes it harder to maintain this nascent surplus and is thus most likely to undermine a recovery where it 's needed most . 
  relax , i 'm sure the rest of you guys have nothing to worry about compared to us ( irish men were recently voted the ugliest in the world ) . 
  ** edit ** : [ source ] ( http://www.independent.ie/woman/love-sex/irish-men-are-the-ugliest-in-the-world-but-irish-woman-scrub-up-well-26821512.html ), 
  i really do n't think the irish hate her . 
  fortunately , there have been none of the ridiculous ( and offensive ) comparisons here in ireland of merkel to hitler that have appeared elsewhere . 
  i may be mistaken on that , but that 's my impression of it . 
  to be honest , a lot of irish people do n't know that much about germany or german politics , so there is a lot more anger directed at our own politicians and bankers . 
  having said that , she is associated with austerity here . 
  most of the time it manifests itself in parodies on television [ like this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=old8nv7c8qs ) , or cartoons like [ this ] ( http://www.heraultwhatson.com/storage/turner.aug17.gif?__squarespace_cacheversion=1313520689983 ) and [ this . 
  ] ( http://www.cagle.com/2012/05/eurozone-crisis/ ) however , if there are offensive comments that you 've seen from irish people towards her , i apologise on behalf of the irish people who do n't think that way . 
   ... human rights arguments would be an obstacle . 
  i know you 're quoting the article but that 's an understatement . 
  it might not have been a serious suggestion , but it was basically calling for mass expulsions of people on denominational grounds . 
  clearly they had n't learnt anything from the history of n. ireland or from other partitions like that of [ india ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partition_of_india ) . 
  just a quick question , are you referring to gypsies from elsewhere in europe or portuguese gypsies / * ciganos * . 
  i 've read a bit about gypsies in spain ( both spanish and from elsewhere ) but i 'm afraid i do n't know much about their situation in portugal . 
  other than that , i am glad to hear that the portuguese are quite open to immigrants . 
  i might become one someday . 
  so why the eu flag if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  i watched an interview with the estonian president who made the point that such a devaluation would wipe out the middle classes ( many of whom borrow ( ed ) in euros ) . 
  [ here 's the link ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geoawuunnvu ) if you 'd like to see it , although he is talking about latvia which is due to join the euro on january 1st . 
  can some spanish person tell me how the [ francisco franco foundation ] ( http://www.fnff.es/default.aspx ) still exists ? 
   but andrew brigden , conservative mp for north west leicestershire , told the same programme he believed mr farage 's comments were `` political tokenism '' . 
  brigden is right , but for the wrong reason . 
  ukip is pretty strongly opposed to free movement of labour and rights for asylum seekers as it stands . 
  farage is simply trying to present a more `` humanitarian '' face of ukip to try and win votes . 
  the fact that he gives no details as to how his plan for syrian refugees is supposed to work is evidence enough that it 's not really sincere and thought through . 
  however , [ here are some examples of the policies that ukip does advocate ] ( http://www.ukip.org/issues/policy-pages/immigration ) for asylum seekers when it 's not trying to make the headlines : * all aslyum seekers would have to be held in secure units , have a minimum five-year wait for citizenship with no rights to benefits . 
  * ukip would also withdraw from the european convention of human rights , the eu charter of fundamental rights and the european convention on refugees . 
  as it stands these charters streamline the process for asylum and accord asylum seekers some rights . 
  that may be true but some of the downvotes/negativity may be because of the way the article was written . 
  the article does n't provide much analysis of the report 's findings or contextualise them ( by interviewing an academic etc ) . 
  for example , the eurozone may be facing years of low growth overall but there are many policy options and variables along the way that may change that , along with the accuracy of this institute 's predictions . 
  ** edit : ** for the record , i actually up voted this . 
  as a matter of fact there is a movement in castille that seeks its independence from the rest of spain called * castellanismo * . 
  they usually fly the * comunero * flag . 
  it seems a tad ridiculous to me . 
  there was a [ referendum ] ( http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/r%c3%a9f%c3%a9rendum_sur_la_collectivit%c3%a9_territoriale_d'alsace ) in april this year on creation of a single entity of alsace out of the two departments it currently forms . 
  i 'm afraid i do n't know much more about the movement , all i know is that the measure was defeated . 
  i completely agree . 
  the building needed work done on it anyway , whether it was going to be kept in use as a synagogue or not . 
  whatever happens now , hopefully people will still be able to visit and learn about this aspect of bradford 's past and culture . 
  number three is slightly inaccurate when it gets to the napoleonic wars in that catalonia was annexed by france during the period 1808 to 1813 . 
  i know the op did n't make it , but i just thought i 'd point that out . 
  other than that , very , very well done op . 
  france , the uk and the usa are [ no longer supplying the opposition ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20131212-usa-uk-halt-non-lethal-aid-syrian-rebels-islamist-front/ ) with `` lethal '' aid , in light of the rise of al-qaeda and other islamist groups in syria . 
  whether the stuff they have already supplied ( to the fsa for example ) falls into the hands of these groups , remains to be seen . 
  i think the question is whether the eu should intervene to prevent humanitarian crises or whether that should be left to member states . 
  i do n't agree that the eu should have to pay in this situation , but i do think action was needed ( given that massacres had broken out ) and that other member states should contribute . 
  it seems to fit the objectives of the common foreign and security policy very well in that regard . 
  if european countries are to have * one * voice on the international stage , then all countries have to be willing to contribute to such efforts . 
  if , however , we opt for the latter option and say that it is the responsibility of the member states , then we should drop the pretence of the cfsp and the battlegroups . 
  if we are never going to use them , the money and effort we currently spend on that would be best placed going elsewhere . 
  ** edit ** here 's another point for intervention and for supporting france in doing so . 
  both the central african republic and mali were/are dangerously close to becoming completely failed states . 
  as the example of somalia shows , it is incredibly difficult to reverse this process once it has happened and places a huge strain on international security , illegal immigration and humanitarian resources . 
  by preventing this , in the future we can use many resources elsewhere and save lives . 
  i am curious as to whether there was any suggestion of the creation of a `` transylvanian state '' ? 
  many states were proposed or briefly existed after wwi ( like an attempt at creating an independent state of alsace-lorraine ) . 
  i know that would mean a bi-national state ( of romanians , hungarians and other minorities ) , so maybe that would n't have appeased the powers at the time . 
  you 'd be surprised how many people mix up ireland and holland in my experience . 
  i 've had to explain to people in my travels , `` it 's a small country beside england . '', 
  then again some people are n't aware that ireland is a separate country and not a part of the uk . 
  i 'm surprised that they saw that as evidence . 
  maybe simply not enough attention has been paid to the issue in parliaments around the world . 
  there might be no political reason behind hollande 's announcement , but given eu-russian relations at the moment , it might be interpreted as a snub . 
  besides sarkozy not going to canada meant very little as france ( [ along with the eu ] ( http://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/canada-eu-ceta/ ) ) has good relations with the country . 
  the same cant be said about russia right now . 
  i was responding to a comment comparing the united states and russia . 
  i accept your point though that there are other countries with larger violations of human rights of their own citizens . 
  according to the law it is effectively illegal to hold any gay pride events , speak in defence of gay rights or say that gay relationships are equal to heterosexual relationships . 
  that 's not outlawing homosexuality but it is clearly restricting homosexual rights in serious ways . 
  it has been pretty clearly demonstrated that those elections were not [ free and fair ] ( http://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.0741v2.pdf ) , with no uncertainty as to the outcome from the outset ( as osce observers highlighted ) . 
  as for his approval ratings , that 's hardly surprising given that the state owned media in russia [ do n't allow criticism of him or his administration ] ( http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1p2-25894292.html ) . 
  as i said , and should have emphasised , russia is in a league of its own with regards treatment of its * own * citizens , especially with regards treatment of minorities . 
  i also do n't deny that the us has failings in foreign policy , such as the ones you pointed out . 
  that 's a bit like trying to compare apples and oranges . 
  russia is in a league of its own with regards human rights violations of its own citizens and treatment of minorities ( such as homosexuals ) . 
  i , for one , believe that this is a civil rights issue that russia is failing on and sets it apart from european standards of human rights , which makes a boycott justified .
