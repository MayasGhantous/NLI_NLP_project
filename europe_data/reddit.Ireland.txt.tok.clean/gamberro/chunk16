  the united states has many , many failings , from foreign policy to violating the privacy of its own citizens ( and those of other countries ) . 
  but at the same time , france and the uk are responsible for similar failings which would make a boycott by hollande of olympic games in the us a bit hypocritical . 
  barrosso tried to set out the commission 's view [ here ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20664907 ) with regards the rest of the uk and `` the continuation of the state . '', 
  whether or not that will change when he leaves office next year remains to be seen . 
  true but now that they have an agreement i assume winning a vote on the issue in the * generalitat * is just a formality . 
  however , as others here have pointed out , it 's not clear how the spanish government will respond to this . 
  this !, 
  i 'd like to see how russian state tv or russia today would swallow the russian ambassador to sweden apologising for these comments . 
   he went on to explain how demonstrators camped out on independence square survived on warm lard heated on burn barrels and used `` ancient african military techniques '' against police . 
  dear god . 
  to be honest , while both fine gael and fianna f\u00e1il are very similar right wing parties , one is a lot more populist than the other . 
  fianna f\u00e1il is a stereotypical `` catch all/big tent party '' , managing to win votes regardless of ideology . 
  since the first ff government in 1932 it 's been in power for 61 out of 79 years !, 
  the fact is that to keep it out of power , opposition parties have to form coalitions of both left and right ( like at the moment ) , making our political system very dysfunctional . 
  she 's a senator which ( in ireland ) means she was n't elected in a general election but indirectly . 
  it 's a complicated and [ archaic process ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seanad_%c3%89ireann#composition ) , including 11 nominees that were appointed by our prime minister ( rather than being elected ) . 
  so sadly despite her blatant ignorance in this video , she has little reason to fear the electorate . 
   i never got the our exports hurting greece nonsense . 
  well firstly as it is a big exporting power sharing a currency with diverse economies , when germany exports outside the eurozone it benefits from a significantly undervalued currency . 
  this is an added advantage to germany 's already strong manufacturing industry and its ability to curb real wages . 
  but now that the peripheral countries are focusing on exports , the euro is likely to appreciate and thereby [ squeeze the less competitive countries all over again . 
  ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b3faf9b0-2489-11e3-8905-00144feab7de.html#axzz2mzvsepin ) secondly , even with the figures in the article , which only account for one month , germany 's current account surplus is still over the 6 percent threshold set by the european commission ( it will probably be [ around 7 percent this year in line with the figure last year . 
  ] ( http://mises.org/daily/6592/ ) ) so , germany is technically in breach of the already high commission threshold for surpluses ( the threshold for deficits is 4 percent ) . 
  if germany still had the deutschmark or another currency , it would appreciate in the face of such strong exports . 
  given that germany is the largest economy in the eurozone those figures should be worrying . 
  my argument would be that germany is entitled to export as much as it likes provided that it imports enough to fall within the thresholds established by the commission . 
  as barroso recently said :  * `` if there is a country that has been insisting on the need to be objective , to respect the rules , it is precisely germany . 
  there was a story about a politics professor in the 1980s here in ireland who hated having to teach about communism for the very reason that all the students would write lennon instead of lenin !, 
  i think president gauck made the ride decision here . 
  while cameron and merkel might have a point about these issues being tackled by `` presence '' , there 's a lot to be said by boycotting events , especially when many people follow suit . 
  again , well done !, 
   some generals who where seen by the civilians the only ones who protected them ( of course some of them did terrible things ) got into the hague tribunal and got locked up . 
  some people in the western balkans might see it a different way , but [ war crimes are war crimes . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_wars#war_crimes ) i agree that members of the un and nato forces should be held to account for pretty heinous abuses such as child prostitution . 
  but the ethnic cleansing during by different factions those wars should not be downplayed, 
  this . 
  i find it hard to take / r/worldnews seriously anymore because of how often rt gets used as a source there . 
  have a look at russia today and you 'll see next to nothing on serious violations of human rights in the country with regards the treatment of homosexuals or the activities of neo-nazi groups . 
  maybe but the story has been picked up by other news agencies too . 
  that also does n't change the fact that his comments were totally unacceptable . 
  i take your point . 
  but leaving the issue about the organisation itself , there is another issue here with regards sending jihadists to syria . 
  at the very least criminal prosecutions should be brought against those responsible . 
  membership of an illegal organisation is a crime in many countries ( including my own ) , so we should prosecute those supplying al-qaeda aligned groups in syria . 
   an international islamic group , [ hizb al tahrir ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hizb_ut-tahrir ) , is at the center of this recruitment in europe , western officials say . 
  the group is particularly strong in the u.k. and denmark , the european diplomat said . 
  it has always amazed me that that organisation is n't banned in the uk and elsewhere . 
  it is essentially calling for an islamic theocracy across the entire muslim world built on sharia . 
  since it 's contrary to european values of secularism and democracy , i 'd argue it has no place in our society . 
  on a final note , given the track record of the ottoman empire ( technically the last sunni caliphate ) as the * sick man of europe * and one where [ genocides were carried out against minorities ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_genocide ) , hizb ut tahrir 's objective seems like a recipe for disaster . 
  what abut the rest of the quote ? 
  is the translation above accurate ? 
  i agree that avoiding the federalist tag in this interview is a very clever move . 
  but since he 's arguing for reforming europe rather than less europe as people like cameron want , i think a clash of views is inevitable . 
  the topic of the debate was whether the eu was good for ireland and he was by far the most inspiring speaker there . 
  i saw schulz debate about a year ago . 
  his english was good enough to be able to convince most of the audience over to his side . 
  i think he 'd make a good commission president , although his federalist views would be very much at odds with certain member states . 
  nope , i mean [ britain itself ** along ** with the crown overseas territories . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/07/britain-tax-havens-queen-secrecy-justice-network ), 
   ... because its the most deregulated , tax free evasive state in the world !, 
  you could easily be talking about the cayman islands , the channel islands , the british virgin islands and all the other british tax havens . 
  people in glass houses ... 
  very good points . 
  let me just highlight one thing though with regards europe and `` printing more money . '', 
  that might be a traditional tactic that accompanies austerity , but eurozone member states ca n't do that . 
  in fact the ecb has a mandate to control inflation which printing money generally causes . 
  there have been interventions by the ecb that carry the risk of moderate inflation ( such as [ quantitative easing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quantitative_easing ) ) but these have been on a much smaller scale than those of the bank of england or the federal reserve . 
  why did channel 9 close ? 
  i realise it was important as it was the only catalan language channel in the community . 
  but was it a political decision or an economic one ( operating at a loss , etc. 
  it may become more pc in some ways , but it does n't seem like the renovated museum will go into much detail at all about what happened in the congo free state and later when the congo became a belgian colony . 
   when it reopens in 2017 , the focus will be on showcasing the diversity of the continent in zones entitles `` man & society '' and `` landscape & biodiversity '' . 
  given that we are talking about the deaths of millions of people due to starvation , disease and `` indiscriminate war '' , i think that the abuses in the congo should have a very significant place in the new museum . 
  i 'm sad to say that despite how much they are going to spend on renovating the museum , the accusation of whitewashing the past will remain unless they give this aspect the attention it deserves . 
  se on avaruusasema . 
  making it a good place to retire to . 
  of course , he 's also omitting the fact that countries like ireland also did n't impose any restrictions in 2004 and received lots of immigrants from eastern europe as a result . 
  surprise surprise we are n't one of the countries pushing for tighter control on movement of labour in the eu . 
  why ? 
  because we 're in a recession we need movement of labour to help the masses of unemployed find jobs . 
  i think he means that the uk did n't impose restrictions on the ten countries that joined in 2004 . 
  having such a large surplus also harms the periphery countries that are struggling to correct their deficits . 
  martin wolf has pointed out that focusing on export growth in the periphery and the core of the eurozone will make the euro appreciate and thereby produce low growth . 
  exactly . 
  turkey also hosts american nuclear missiles as part of its `` nuclear sharing '' strategy which strengthens its hand in the face of other regional powers ( such as iran ) . 
  while erdogan might like to float the idea of giving up on the eu to appease his guest , i strongly doubt turkey is going to give up on nato . 
  restraining germany 's exports is not the issue as others in this thread have pointed out . 
  nor are germany 's exports the centre of the commission 's investigation . 
  the issue is the surplus or the difference between exports and imports , not the amount that germany exports . 
  there currently are guidelines set in place by the commission with regards excessive surpluses and deficits ( with surpluses being limited to 6 percent of gdp over three years ) . 
  germany 's surplus last year was over 7 percent . 
  ** edit ** i should add that there are already issues with that threshold being so high in comparison to the one for deficits ( four percent ) . 
  exactly !, 
  he is seeking to portray brussels as something that is out of control that has had , up to now , free reign . 
  that 's a pretty serious misstatement or else a lie . 
  even the british audit of the eu found that the current balance of competences between the eu and the member states is `` broadly appropriate . '', 
  thanks . 
  it was mentioned a lot in the interview but it was n't clear exactly what was meant . 
  pardon my ignorance but what is meant by the `` little englander mentality '' in this case ?
