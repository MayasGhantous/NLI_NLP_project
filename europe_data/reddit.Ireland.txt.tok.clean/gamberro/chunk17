  cheers for that . 
  it helps as i 'd love to visit turkey someday . 
  i support an investigation ( or public inquiry ) into what happened and even prosecutions as these activities were outside the parameters of the law . 
  let the truth come out and let there be prosecutions if the people are still alive . 
  ** but ** let 's also keep it in perspective and context as part of a larger cycle of violence , both sectarian and against the british government . 
  it is worth remembering that republican paramilitaries were responsible for [ over 60 percent of the casualties during the conflict . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles#casualties ) given that prisoners from both the loyalist and republican paramilitaries have been released as part of the good friday agreement , we should also remember that incarcerating the former british soldiers would only be punishing some of those responsible for the violence . 
  furthermore greater investigations should also be targeted at these paramilitary groups . 
  thanks for clearing that up . 
  does anybody know if non-muslims would still be free to visit if it were turned into a mosque ? 
  i do n't know how it is in turkey , but as a non-muslim i was not allowed to visit mosques in my travels . 
   that the nsa is not the only source of danger , does n't mean they are n't at all . 
  true , but now that we know gchq and dche do these things , i wonder if people will react in the same way towards the british and french governments ( given that they are germany 's allies and european partners ) . 
  will there be protests against the activities of these intelligence agencies the next time hollande or cameron visit berlin or anywhere else ? 
  probably not . 
  but the next time obama does he will be challenged on the nsa and i 'm sure there will be protests . 
  my point is where is the consistency ? 
  maybe these agencies have n't spied to the same extent as the nsa , but they are still part of it with pretty shady activities of their own such as [ `` tempora '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tempora ) and [ spying on foreign leaders . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/16/gchq-intercepted-communications-g20-summits ) if we are against intelligence agencies carrying out mass-surveillance , we have to be opposed to all of them doing so ( nsa , gchq , dche etc. ), 
  if we 're just going to protest against the nsa , then we are at least guilty of serious hypocrisy . 
  first of all i do n't agree with smearing the spd candidate but i think it 's pretty clear what [ anti-americanism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-americanism ) is . 
  secondly , as the us is a major trading partner of germany and a nato ally , it would matter given that the spd is the second largest party in the bundestag . 
  ** edit ** in light of your comment that `` they are the source of danger '' it 's also worth considering that many intelligence agencies in europe ( gchq and dche ) are involved in these kind of mass-surveillance activities , not just the nsa . 
  i agree with your assessment about why irish and spanish debt went down . 
  but if we look at a definition of [ public expenditure ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_spending ) we can see that the journalist 's view is mistaken . 
  public expenditure during this period in both countries was not the cause of the crisis but rather the construction and property boom . 
  nor were these governments taking advantage of low interest rates to spend as the article suggests . 
  rather the low interest rates fed the construction bubble in their respective banking sectors . 
  in ireland government debt only exploded when the bubble burst which left a massive hole in the state 's finances . 
   `` as part of a single currency with strong partners to the north , even the piigs could borrow at low interest rates , and they borrowed voraciously not for investment but to pump up public spending . '', 
  funny this article goes on about bad economics because the journalist seems to have completely misdiagnosed the cause of the crisis . 
  aside from greece , the crisis in the periphery countries arose from the financial sector and not from public spending . 
  if you look at debt to gdp for [ ireland ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ireland/government-debt-to-gdp ) and [ spain ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/government-debt-to-gdp ) and it paints a very different picture from what the journalist suggests . 
  debt levels in both countries were well below the prescribed level set out in the stability and growth pact and they managed to comply with the rules on budget deficits . 
  if we look at germany during this period , it 's clear that it did n't fulfil the criteria either for reducing its debt or on occasion to [ controlling its deficit . 
  ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-03-1560_en.htm ) that is not to say for a minute that the booms in both countries peripheral were sustainable or that germany was n't pushing through reforms during this period to restore competitiveness . 
  but based on the facts above , i do n't think the journalist knows what he/she 's talking about . 
  i thought barroso 's comment was quite interesting given the reaction in berlin to the decision to launch an inquiry . 
   * `` if there is a country that has emphasised the need to be objective , to respect the rules , it has been germany . 
  i 've made this point in a few other threads on this topic so apologies if this post comes across as boring and unoriginal . 
  the german current account surplus is not a measurement of the country 's competitiveness but rather how much it exports more than it imports or '' * the balance between domestic production and consumption * '' . 
  the competitiveness of germany is in reality shown in the [ volume of its exports ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_exports ) ( which is remarkable enough in itself ) , not in the difference between those and its imports . 
  the commission considers that member states have an imbalance if the deficit is set at more than 4 percent of gdp over three years while an imbalance on surpluses is set at 6 percent of gdp . 
  last year the german surplus was 7 percent of gdp that 's why the surplus is grabbing the attention of eu leaders . 
  [ matthew klein ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-01/u-s-to-germany-try-being-helpful-for-a-change.html ) , [ martin wolff ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b3faf9b0-2489-11e3-8905-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=intl#axzz2kgghvnwr ) and [ others have shown ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx1nnndhrn4 ) the restricting of domestic demand in germany is having serious consequences for the rest of the eurozone . 
  that 's a very good assessment . 
  with regards your last comment about ordo-liberalism , [ here 's an article i found ] ( http://ecfr.eu/page/-/ecfr49_germany_brief.pdf ) on the latter 's impact on germany 's response to the crisis . 
  i really liked the series and would definitely like to see more of this sort . 
  maybe we could do a similar one about cities in europe along the lines of `` what do you know about berlin ? '', 
  i think that would work better than regions as there 's simply so much that could be said about one city . 
  that would keep the interest going and at the very least provide a list of things to visit whenever we travel . 
  thanks again for taking the time to organise this series anyway . 
  i think people are surprised at how oblivious he was to the irony of the situation . 
  that 's all true and i agree 100 percent with your take on the referendums . 
  however , i think euroscepticism did have a role in defeating the first lisbon referendum with groups like libertas and coir making lots of false claims about it . 
  euroscepticism takes a different form in every country i think . 
  just look at ireland and the uk which have a lot in common culturally but have quite different eurosceptic movements . 
  here euroscepticism is mainly the terrain of the extreme-left like sinn f\u00e9in or people who are very conservative on social issues . 
  i doubt many people in the uk would be worried about the possibility of abortion arising from eu membership , but that 's the case here . 
  having said that , i do n't think it 's fair to point the finger at the uk as the most eurosceptic country . 
  euroscepticism in ireland has already helped defeat two refenda on europe unfortunately ( the nice treaty and lisbon treaty first time round ) . 
  true , but that would involve admitting that the uk , like every other member state , already forms part of a confederation of sorts . 
  very few leaders of member states are willing to admit that publicly and even fewer are willing to implement policies on the own accord to make that clearer . 
  i agree . 
  one thing would be submitting treaty changes to a referendum in a member state ( which is the case in some countries like ireland ) . 
  since some countries already have that right , germany would be entitled to the same if it so chose . 
  however , it would be another thing entirely to have the right to hold referenda on policy changes that are discussed and approved through the eu 's legislative process ( including bailouts ) . 
  at the very least that seems very impractical . 
  from the article it seems that the people behind the proposal want that too . 
  seriously though are n't the british bases on cyprus controversial ? 
  just curious . 
  sorry but the trade surplus is not an indicator of german competitiveness but rather how much it exports more than it imports or '' * the balance between domestic production and consumption * '' . 
  the competitiveness of germany is in reality shown in the [ volume of its exports ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_exports ) , not in the difference between those and its imports . 
  as [ matthew klein ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-01/u-s-to-germany-try-being-helpful-for-a-change.html ) , [ martin wolff ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b3faf9b0-2489-11e3-8905-00144feab7de.html#axzz2kgghvnwr ) and [ others have shown ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx1nnndhrn4 ) the restricting of domestic demand in germany is having serious consequences for the rest of the eurozone . 
  as for the comment about lazy unskilled workers , many of the countries that are suffering at the moment ( including my own ) have [ working hours ] ( http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/studies/tn0903039s/tn0903039s.htm ) and [ productivity ] ( http://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/european-issues/0289-labour-costs-and-crisis-management-in-the-euro-zone-a-reinterpretation-of-divergences-in ) in line with the european average . 
  what do you mean by `` almost death '' ? 
  do you mean they are n't taken seriously ? 
  the [ french president ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/05/15/article-2144567-1319610e000005dc-289_964x605.jpg ) lives in a gated community of sorts . 
  does that make his views invalid ? 
   as germany dwells on that past , the rest of the world has moved on . 
  um , this might be a bit pedantic but germany has also moved on !, 
  they just have a strong commitment to remembering the past to ensure that every generation learns from it . 
  more countries should follow that example in my opinion . 
  with all due respect the rules as originally written did not take into account many factors . 
  it was assumed initially that adhering to the rules found in the stability and growth pact would mean that the eurozone would n't need a fiscal actor or a lender of last resort . 
  as we 've seen since the crisis began , those assumptions were misguided . 
  here are two points to back this up : * for example , [ ireland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:irish_debt_and_eu_average.png ) and [ spain ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/spanish_debt_and_eu_average.png ) , complied with budget and public debt limits in the first few years of the euro before rescuing the banking sector led public debt to explode . 
  so despite adhering to the rules for fiscal policy , the fact that the creation of the euro did n't include a banking regulator or a banking union means that both countries now have a severe sovereign debt crisis . 
  * secondly , the ecb may be technically breaking its mandate by helping countries like italy and spain , but if it had n't these countries would have had to make a disorderly exit from the eurozone . 
  economists like [ paul de grauwe ] ( http://ideas.repec.org/p/ces/ceswps/_3821.html ) have argued that the fact that the ecb does n't officially act as a lender of last resort means that these countries have been effectively downgraded to third world countries who are dependent on winning the confidence of the markets by controlling their debt to gdp ratio . 
  in the absence of a lender of last resort , the fears of the market can lead to liquidity crises turning into to solvency ones . 
  so a european country like the uk which has a lender of last resort ( the bank of england ) can have a significantly [ higher debt ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/government-debt-to-gdp ) than a country that does n't like [ spain . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/government-debt-to-gdp ) lastly , the rules shaping the eurozone have already been amended since the crisis began and the eurobond is just one proposal as to how to fix the problems . 
  so far eurozone leaders have adopted proposals in the fashion of the core countries with measures such as the fiscal compact . 
  the latter enshrines in law the principle that member states ' budgets must be either balanced or in surplus . 
  however , i think what barroso is arguing that that the agreements to ensure sound fiscal policy are n't enough enough . 
  on a final note , i highly recommend [ this article ] ( http://www.cer.org.uk/publications/archive/essay/2011/why-stricter-rules-threaten-eurozone ) from the centre for european reform which spells out pretty clearly what core countries need to do ( albeit from a pro-periphery perspective ) . 
   spying - even spying on friendly nations - is what intelligence services do . 
  here 's an example to strengthen your point : it 's well documented that states like israel [ conduct spying operations on the us . 
  ] ( http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/former-u-s-officials-say-cia-considers-israel-to-be-mideast-s-biggest-spy-threat-1.454189 ) if one of the largest recipients of us foreign aid ( and an ally ) is doing that , it 's hardly surprising if others are doing the same .
