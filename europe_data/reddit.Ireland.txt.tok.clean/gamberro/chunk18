  this . 
  although somehow finding a llama in the bathroom would n't be quite the same . 
  when i heard his speech on the eu , he kept saying that `` we in britain do n't want that . '', 
  as somebody from outside the uk but with lots of friends there , i was wondering what he meant by britain per se . 
  i think a lot of his conclusions about what `` britain '' wants out of its relationship with the eu could n't apply to scotland , n. ireland or even a lot of people in england . 
  however , cameron is looking to get reelected so maybe he 's appealing to his own party base or those inclined to vote conservative with comments like this one . 
  you 're right . 
  thanks for the correction . 
  well i 'm supposed to be working but here goes : * second largest country in europe and also one of the most mountainous . 
  * you guys helped us out ( or tried to ) in [ a famous battle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_kinsale ) when the irish lords rebelled against the english . 
  it did n't work and it marked the end of the gaelic order in ireland , but it 's the thought that counts . 
  * the medieval period was shaped by the * reconquista * of northern kingdoms slowly expanding southwards at the expense of the muslim kingdoms or * taifas * . 
  during this period what is now spain was quite diverse religiously with large communities of jews and muslims . 
  * quite diverse linguistically with four languages having co-official status in their respective * comunidad aut\u00f3noma * : basque , catalan , valencian and galician . 
  there are also separatist movements in each of these communities . 
  * 1492 - not only were the americas discovered but the * reconquista * ended with the fall of granada and the conversion ( or expulsion ) of the jews . 
  this was followed by a period of consolidation around catholicism and the inquisition generally centred around [ `` new christians . 
  '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/converso ) * in the period after the discovery of the americas spain became the leading european power of the age . 
  great works of art and literature were produced . 
  but there was also great wastage such as in [ the wars in the netherlands ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eighty_years'_war ) and enormous monuments like [ el escorial ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/vista_aerea_del_monasterio_de_el_escorial.jpg ) . 
  * a brutal civil war in the 1930s saw the victory of the falangists ( nationalists ) over the republicans . 
  as a result , the neo-fascist dictator franco would rule spain from 1939 to 1975 . 
  * it 's a place where people from the north of the continent go on holidays . 
  it 's visited by something like 57 million people a year . 
  * seriously badly hit by the economic crisis in recent years with record high unemployment . 
  * wonderful food especially * cocido madrile\u00f1o * and * paella valenciana * . 
  i know these are very touristy dishes but what can you do . 
  i agree that there seemed to be a certain amount of anti-americanism in the commentary on the nsa . 
  i think if people are opposed to these things , there should be a similar amount of outrage at gchq , dgse , the bnd and all the other intelligence agencies involved . 
  i do n't condone any of these activities for a second , but i think the tapping of leaders phones is a slightly different issue since it did n't involve a system of mass surveillance . 
  but having said that , we already know that [ gchq monitored foreign leaders at g20 summits ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/16/gchq-intercepted-communications-g20-summits ) . 
  is there going to be the same kind of outrage over the tapping of merkel 's phone ? 
  i doubt it . 
  on a final note , we will have to wait and see if other intelligence agencies in europe spy on other european leaders and allies . 
  as it stands , we only have evidence that gchq has done that . 
  a monarch with tattoos ? 
  that 's pretty badass !, 
  economists like paul de grauwe have pointed to a need for [ greater aggregate demand from the core countries to help counteract some of the imbalances in the eurozone . 
  ] ( http://www.social-europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ebook.pdf ) at the moment demand is falling in the periphery which will affect all the eurozone countries including germany . 
  let me just point to one part of the article i linked to :  the german government has now , for three year bonds , a zero interest rate ; 10 years , 1.5 % . 
  so the german government gets money almost for free . 
  why is it waiting ? 
  as for germany 's current account surplus , one of the problems is that it relies on limiting demand at home while focusing on export strategies usually found in much smaller and open economies . 
  the thresholds on current account imbalances are currently set at + / - 4 percent of gdp . 
  meanwhile the current account surplus threshold is currently set at 6 percent of gdp . 
  [ germany 's current account surplus is very close to the threshold at 5.9 percent of gdp . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/germany-s-strange-parallel-universe-1.1538726?page=2 ) martin wolf 's argument goes that due to the size of the german economy that surplus is considerable and should be smaller . 
  ** tl : dr ** both articles argue that greater demand in germany would help even out some of the macroeconomic imbalances in the eurozone , including that of the current account . 
  you would n't happen to have a link to those statistics would you ? 
  a quick google search did n't come up with any and i would love to have those on hand when countering ukip supporters . 
  one of the most ignorant things about british eurosceptic arguments ( whether they 're from ukip or the conservative party ) is that they do n't take into consideration things like this article . 
  in a recent debate [ farage called for the uk to leave the eu and embrace the commonwealth instead . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdnxc6r87xs ) what he meant of course was prosperous middle income countries in the commonwealth where the population is mostly white like australia/canada and not nigeria or pakistan . 
  but how on earth can you think that strategy would even work if you are n't listening to what countries like australia are saying now ? 
  i have to say i was really surprised at that as well . 
  how did she manage day to day for 14 years without speaking it ? 
  however , i think the same logic about learning the local language should be applied to people from the rest of europe who move to the netherlands ( or wherever else ) , purely as a matter of integration and respect for the local culture . 
  for example , i know people from ireland who spent years in the netherlands only speaking english and never learning any dutch . 
  what criteria is der spiegel basing competitiveness on in that chart ? 
  it does n't seem clear at all . 
  unit labour costs , which are often used in assessing competitiveness , [ paint a different picture ] ( http://letterstocreationists.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/euro-unit-labor-costs2.jpg ) ( except for italy ) . 
  if this is true , i hope it gets the attention it deserves . 
  i 'm going to leave aside the case of spying on leaders themselves ( such as merkel ) , which is serious enough as it is . 
  my point is that it is very easy for the governments and media in europe to point the finger at america for mass surveillance . 
  but if this is true then this problem is far bigger than just america and extends into active european cooperation with this mass surveillance . 
  i once heard that only 1 percent of ireland was covered by forest in 1900 . 
  this graphic shows a positive change at least . 
  i am pretty horrified as well . 
  how you could do that to somebody is just beyond me . 
  on a side note , according to [ this article ] ( http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent_messenger/news/seven-held-in-murder-probe-7735/ ) some of those involved were immigrants themselves . 
  i was worried that these cases were driven by hysteria given that they did seem to appear very quickly after the case of maria in greece . 
  i can only imagine all the anguish , stress and humiliation that having their child taken away from them caused the family in this case . 
  is it just me or has this case emerged * very * quickly after that of maria in greece ? 
  i 'm going to wait until we get dna evidence anyway . 
  very good question op !, 
  on a side node , the centre for european reform asked a few economists the same question and those who are interested can see [ the article here . 
  ] ( http://www.cer.org.uk/publications/archive/report/2013/future-europes-economy-disaster-or-deliverance ) i thought it was worth sharing as it includes names from both sides of the debate such as paul de grauwe and thomas mayer . 
  this gives the best indication as to whether the depression in the periphery ( ireland , spain , greece etc. ), 
  will end or not . 
  as for my views ? 
  i personally think the eu will still be around . 
  there are still too many unknowns to be certain about what form it will take . 
  however , we will have a banking union by then and perhaps other mechanisms to stabilise the union ( such as a unemployment fund ) . 
  while i do n't think scotland or catalonia will be independent , i 'm sure a compromise will have been reached to accommodate both sides . 
   i never had to pay for a bus , i got waved through by the driver when i tried to pay . 
  how on earth did you manage that ? 
  i 'd love the same to happen to me on buses here . 
   it 's pretty much the economic principle of keynes in action : make yourself fit for the bad times while you can . 
  i 'm surprised you say that as that as schr\u00f6der 's policies ( such as agenda 2010 ) were not inspired by keynesian thinking at all . 
  [ ordoliberalism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ordoliberalism ) continues to have a legacy in shaping german economic policy and is anti-keynesian in principle , seeing the government 's role as ensuring the maximum output of the market . 
  this applied to schr\u00f6der 's plans to reform the economy and continues to apply ( [ as demonstrated by the fiscal compact and the * shuldenbremse * ) ] ( http://ecfr.eu/page/-/ecfr49_germany_brief.pdf ) . 
  as you can see in the above article , this is similar to the neo-classical economic view that disagrees with government intervention to support aggregate demand in a recession . 
  on another note , before the financial crisis countries like ireland also appeared to be operating counter-cyclically ( at least in terms of fiscal policy ) and [ easily complied with the stability and growth pact ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/irish_debt_and_eu_average.png ) . 
  the difference was that ireland 's growth became based a speculative bubble and we did n't focus on competitiveness like germany did . 
  when the bubble burst , we discovered that we were n't playing it safe at all . 
  moving the european court of justice to strasbourg would actually make a lot of sense and would be a good solution . 
  the european court of human rights is already based there so technically it would have remain an important city for decision making at a european level . 
  agreed . 
  i think the issue is not if the former yugoslavian countries ( plus albania ) join , but when . 
  i 'm in favour of them joining but that in the short term we need to focus on the many things that need to get sorted out in the eu .
