  i ca n't say i speak irish very well so the only expression that comes to mind is this one : gaeilge : * t\u00e1 s\u00e9 dubh le daoine . 
  * literally : it 's black with people . 
  meaning : this place is crowded . 
  that is * if * they are allowed to leave and still remain within the union . 
  it is far from clear at the moment that that is the case . 
  certainly the commission at the moment has indicated that it is impossible for part of a member state to become independent and remain in the eu . 
  on the other hand maybe a different legal reasoning would apply if a member state dissolved entirely into its constituent parts ( like czechoslovakia did in 1993 ) . 
   * `` do n't think that things are better than where you come from because once you start living in the place , you have to start dealing with the same bullshit ( if not more ) . 
  '' * i could n't agree more . 
  thanks to the op for posting this . 
  i hate to be the one to break it to you but we 're a * different * country and have been self-governing since 1922 . 
  i 'll accept that we are very close to the uk geographically ( along with having a special situation with n. ireland ) but so are lots of places . 
  on another note , op if you 'd like to go somewhere english speaking and very close to the uk then look for jobs in dublin . 
  a warning though there 's no nhs if you get sick , public transport is poor and well ... there is the [ whole recession thing going on . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%e2%80%9313_irish_financial_crisis ), 
  it 's good to see how things have changed in just three years . 
  i do n't know if it 's because of the recession or not but ireland has dropped two percentage points since 2009 . 
  that 's a positive change . 
  really ? 
  what countries did you visit if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  it 's interesting as you can still see a marked difference between the former eastern block countries on this map . 
  i hope you do n't mind me asking but why is that controversial in the uk ? 
  or i mean , why did cameron single the working time directive out in his speech on the eu ? 
   germany does n't have an nhs , an imperialist-wannabe military , etc. 
  how does that work if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  germany [ seems to be doing pretty well healthcare wise ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/health_care_compared#international_comparisons ) and the state spends a lot on healthcare . 
  the people have spoken but the argument still has n't been made as to why we need an upper house given ireland 's size and political structure . 
  david farrell ( head of the school of politics at ucd ) made the point that [ there is no need for one given ireland 's unitary non-federal nature ] ( http://politicalreform.ie/2013/09/21/why-i-will-be-voting-no-in-the-seanad-referendum/ ) . 
  it 's worth pointing out that despite that stance , farrell was actually calling for a `` no '' vote in the referendum . 
  sorry i did n't see that . 
  my fault . 
  i agree that serious reform is needed but i am voting to abolish it . 
  as it stands the seanad is seriously undemocratic and archaic in structure . 
  whatever the outcome of tommorow 's referendum , those advocating a reformed upper house will still have their chance to do sp at the next general election ( either to create a new one or reform the existing one ) . 
  aye , but there will be fewer meaningless jobs to go around , especially if you fail to get elected . 
  at the moment the senators that are nominated by the taoiseach are usually members of his own party who fall into that category . 
  as the article mentions there is also the war in chechnya and the ongoing one in syria to consider . 
  putin certainly did n't prevent the former and russia has a big role in the latter . 
  i think this is a terrible mistake . 
  i 've met many romanians who arrived following accession and have adapted incredibly well . 
  hell , their kids speak english with irish accents !, 
  if the issue surrounding schengen is one about enforcing border controls then have inspections by the eu to show that these are being applied properly . 
  ** edit ** sorry i did n't mention anything about bulgarians but i have n't had the pleasure of getting to know many of you ... yet !, 
  i 'm sure you guys are awesome though . 
  what do people think about the time zone change ? 
  is it a serious proposal or just an idea ? 
  how is it being funded if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  i mean , while it is beautiful i certainly hope taxpayers ' money is n't being spent on that . 
  this !, 
  a proper public transport system ( and a metro ) is desperately needed . 
  proper cycle lanes would n't hurt either . 
  in terms of lagers we do have [ harp ] ( http://www.theperfectlyhappyman.com/harp-lager/ ) although it 's not that common outside of ireland . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
   the process was patented back in the 1930s , and it is reckoned to be one of the most important technologies available for tackling greenhouse gas emissions . 
  can somebody more enlightened than me shed light on this ? 
  is the patent on this a problem for developing this kind of technology ? 
  we drink more than the brits . 
  i guess there is some truth to the stereotype . 
  good video . 
  one little question though , the reporter says that there has been more than a decade of economic stagnation in portugal . 
  is that correct ? 
  looking at the gdp growth rate for the noughties [ paints a slightly more positive picture . 
  ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lmqse5yhcb0/tas8kzlrqli/aaaaaaaaaky/cnbsdn6w9ea/s1600/portugal%2bgdp%2bgrowth%2bjan%2b2000%2b-%2bapr%2b2011.jpg ), 
  pm me the address and i will send her a postcard from the emerald isle . 
  for the record the article is wrong . 
  according to the rules shaping epso competitions if your native language is english your second language ( which you 'll be interviewed in ) has to be either french * or * german . 
  the way that sentence is written makes it sound like you have to have a good level of both which is a substantially larger undertaking . 
  you 're welcome . 
  i apologise to other users and the moderators if this article does n't have much to do with europe * per se * . 
  perhaps i was mistaken but i thought that since it provided insight into russian foreign policy it ought to be shared here . 
  the novel is a work of fiction and although conrad had actually been to the congo , he fell ill shortly after he reached l\u00e9opoldville ( kinshasa ) , meaning he never saw the worst atrocities . 
  that 's not to say that he did n't hear about them but there are better accounts out there . 
  * now to answer the op 's question in a very succinct way * : the [ congo free state ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congo_free_state ) ( the belgian congo would come later ) was a territory created and privately controlled by the king of the belgians , l\u00e9opold ii . 
  l\u00e9opold had hired explorers such as stanley to help him stake his claim on the territory and if you compare the territory to the congo basin you can see [ how much he managed to get his hands on ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/congolualaba_watershed_plain_political.png ) . 
  the congo basin itself is highly important strategically , stretching across the heart of the continent in a similar fashion to the amazon . 
  essentially stanley and other europeans hoped that this could be an artery through which one could access the interior and a basin stretching over 3.7 million square kilometres . 
  however , much to the chagrin of stanley and l\u00e9opold , in many places the river is made impassible by rapids , [ some over 100 km across ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanley_falls ) . 
  to harness this gateway into the interior , whoever occupied the congo had to invest in building towns , roads and railways to get around the parts where it was impassible . 
  the huge expense that this entailed was part ( and only part ) of the reason why l\u00e9opold embarked on a program to force the natives to pay tax . 
  but l\u00e9opold himself was also inspired by mercantilist ideas of colonies being profitable and set out to turn the congo into the same . 
  however , this was only possible through a regime of forced labour or a [ * corv\u00e9e * ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corv%c3%a9e ) on a large scale , which was enforced through coercion and brutal methods such as mutilation or worse . 
  reports by missionaries and diplomats led to an international outcry , an investigation , forced labour being suppressed and the territory being transferred to the belgian state in 1908 ( thus the beginning of the belgian congo ) . 
  the death toll as a result of the forced labour regime , starvation , disease and the massive disruption the former caused has been placed in the millions ( with some estimates placing it between 5 to 10 ) . 
  many diseases such as sleeping sickness were spread as a result of the congo free state being created with movement of people exposing populations to diseases that were otherwise uncommon . 
  ** some suggestions for further reading ** : [ * the eyes of another race * ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/the-eyes-another-race-casements/dp/1900621991/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1378363000&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+eyes+of+another+race+roger+casement%27s+congo+report+and+1903+diary ) roger casement was the british consul in the congo during this period and was famous for a report he created for the foreign office into what happened there . 
  this book contains his actual report and his diary that he kept at the time . 
  but this is a valuable source as he visited parts of the congo before and after forced labour was introduced . 
  [ * king leopold 's ghost * ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/king-leopolds-ghost-ebook/dp/b0050njmkg/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1378363664&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=king+leopold%27s+ghost ) - adam hochschild 's work is probably the most famous popular history book on the topic . 
  it 's a good place to start if your interested in this topic . 
  [ * the king incorproated * ] ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/the-king-incorporated-leopold-second/dp/1862072906/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top ) - this is part biography and part account of the actions of l\u00e9opold in the congo . 
  it 's pretty thorough and a bit more professional for my tastes than hochschild 's book . 
  finally , if you 'd like to see more source material , [ * here is a parliamentary debate * ] ( http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1903/may/20/congo-free-state#column_1293 ) on the subject . 
  i recommend starting from the paragraph i linked to , starting with `` this house would naturally expect ... '' ** edit ** there are other academic books available that i 'd highly recommend . 
  however , they are very expensive so i 've put items on this list that are at the lower end of the price spectrum . 
   a few english people used to hang signs in their store-fronts 50 years ago , barring certain races and nationalities so we ca n't criticize endless migration to ireland . 
  that 's your argument . 
  while that has become part of irish popular history , the reality paints quite a different picture , at least with regards the [ story of the irish in the united states .

  why are the figures from november so different from the other months ? 
  which one ?
