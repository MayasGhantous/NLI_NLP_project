  out of curiosity , how are the mayor of calais ' comments leading to opposition to the eu ? 
  surely the main point about britain 's benefit system acting like a magnet would remain if the uk left the eu ( correct me if i am mistaken ) . 
  also would n't the situation in calais stay the same if the uk left ? 
  so long as france stays in the schengen zone , illegal migrants will be able to cross the eu towards calais . 
  i decided not to editorialise the title but i thought it was relevant for / r/europe as the new president is of english and scottish descent . 
  but i admit that is pushing it a bit in terms of relevance . 
  thanks and sorry about that . 
  ** uk ** - i 'm going to be honest , your towns and cities are much nicer than ours . 
  architecturally speaking most of them are very impressive . 
  you 've made enormous contributions to science , literature and many other areas . 
  having spent a year of my life there , i can say you guys are a nice and very polite bunch . 
  bravo !, 
  he/she is just a troll so it 's better not to rise to the challenge this time . 
  as the other poster said `` people in glass houses ... '' however , i am sorry if i offended anybody with what i wrote . 
  ** edit : ** out of respect to the people i offended , i 've removed it . 
  i was trolling the troll and pointing out that the uk is far from a bastion of democracy . 
  under normal circumstances the eu cutting off funding ( or threatening to ) would burst this idiot 's bubble . 
  however , orb\u00e1n ( and consequently fidesz ) has a stranglehold on the press in hungary , so it might be less effective than hoped for . 
  if only we had listened to the economist bertie was insulting instead of that moron we had in power . 
  out of curiosity how did a german person hear about that ? 
  you 're right , sorry about that . 
  i 'm surprised northern ireland has a life expectancy slightly lower than the rest of the country . 
  it is a relatively poor part of ireland ( and the uk ) but i would have thought that with the nhs life expectancy might be slightly higher . 
  could you explain or send me a link ( either in spanish or in english ) giving me a background on the caja madrid black cards case . 
  i 've seen lots of references to it in el pa\u00eds , but do n't understand what it refers to very well . 
  ** ireland ** i do n't have a lot of time but i guess some news from here is better than no news . 
  * controversy continues around the introduction of water charges with [ thousands of people out on the streets of limerick during the week . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/more-than-6-000-people-protest-against-water-charges-in-limerick-1.1977301 ) adding to the anger are reports of the bonuses available at the new semi-state body in charge of running it ( irish water ) , including a [ $ 9,000 bonus for staff `` in need of improvement . 
  '' ] ( http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/irish-water-to-pay-9000-bonus-to-staff-in-need-of-improvement-30676922.html ) another point of controversy is that people are currently being charged for water before they have a water meter installed in their house . 
  there 's speculation that the head of the semi-state body [ might be sacked over his handling of the set-up of the organisation . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/john-tierney-needs-to-be-front-and-centre-for-irish-water-1.1975978 ) * sinn f\u00e9in ( the political wing of the pira ) has been in the spotlight all week over revelations of how the pira handled allegations of [ sexual abuse and other crimes . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/kneecapping-yes-but-a-victim-s-wellbeing-wasn-t-an-ira-priority-1.1975897?page=2 ) this is notable as sinn f\u00e9in has been doing very well in the polls up until now . 
  a woman named mairia cahill came forward saying that she was raped by a senior pira member in 1998 and then forced to meet with him in a ira `` kangaroo court . '', 
  over the week other women came forward as well and allegations have been made this week that the pira moved sexual offenders to dublin ( and elsewhere ) to avoid damaging their movement . 
  ms. cahill [ met our prime minister ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/taoiseach-describes-meeting-ma%c3%adria-cahill-as-a-privilege-1.1973398 ) this week and the subject [ brought about angry scenes in our parliament . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/this-was-not-leaders-questions-as-we-know-it-it-was-an-unprecedented-situation-in-the-d%c3%a1il-1.1973438 ) i 'm sure there are a few things i 've missed but hopefully somebody will fill in the rest . 
  it 's a bank holiday here after all . 
  what did i just watch ? 
  also what kind of snake is that ? 
  i believe brown was speaking to a labour voter who was giving out about immigration from eastern europe . 
  i do n't know what she said exactly but he was wrong to call her that . 
  you may be right about the labour vote in the past but i 'll also point out that blair was very popular initially so i think it 's fair to say that he did connect to a lot of the centre-left and centre-right . 
  then of course , labour has taken the working class vote for granted while it shifted further and further to the right . 
  so i find it strange that the working class are voting for a party that 's even further to the right and advocates very thatcherite economic policies of tight fiscal spending and free market capitalism ( ukip advocates reducing corporation tax , abolishing in heritance tax and carrying out # 77 billion of cuts to the public sector to reduce the deficit ) . 
  you 're on to something there . 
  i guess it 's important to remember that while there are cultural similarities between us , there are many differences too which manifests itself in politics . 
  what i ca n't understand is the shift from former labour voters in the uk to ukip . 
  the british labour party has moved too far to the right , so instead of voting for another left wing party , they 're voting for a thatcherite one ? 
  then of course there 's the strange attribution of the uk 's ills to the eu . 
  was the crisis in the uk caused by eu or euro membership ? 
  nope . 
  was austerity imposed by the eu ? 
  nope . 
  both of those things are partially true in ireland but not in the uk . 
  we must have had different experiences so . 
  i have met some french people of maghreb ( ian ) descent in my country and they seemed very friendly . 
  any particular reason you do n't like algeria ? 
  a good rule of thumb is not take claims made by any politician says at face value . 
  most have a knack for being flexible with the truth or avoiding the answering the question that was asked . 
  however , given that farage in particular is vehemently anti-eu and frequently [ says stuff about it that is n't true , ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/23mvnu/antieu_posters_for_uk_local_elections_xpost_from/cgytfzt?context=3 ) i 'd like to see his evidence before i believe him . 
  on another point ( supposing farage was correct ) , why exactly would a eurosceptic want to participate in an eu delegation to kazakhistan ? 
  surely closer ties between the eu and the rest of the world does n't fit with her opposition to european integration ? 
  i asked because i was n't sure if you were from the french or spanish side of the basque country . 
  your english is superb by the way . 
   `` today , our common goal is to counter the glorification of nazism , firmly counter attempts to revise the results of world war ii . '', 
  one of the results of wwii was that states would not change their borders by force . 
  putin threw that lesson out the window when he invaded , held a sham referendum and unilaterally annexed crimea . 
  do you mean the spanish colonies ? 
  i should have made it clear that i meant this drove up current account deficits before the crisis . 
  there were other reasons for those deficits of course ( lack of an exchange rate and losses in competitiveness in the periphery ) but it 's also clear that germany 's export led growth had a role in that too . 
  i also do n't doubt that germany 's total trade with other eu countries has been declining , but you can see there is a clear correlation with the most probable reason for it ; the economic crisis starting in 2008 . 
  with demand falling in the eurozone , germany has no choice but to export to the rest of the world . 
  the difficulty with this is that the rest of the eurozone is now trying to do the same . 
  if this continues , the inevitable result will be that the euro will appreciate , thereby squeezing the less efficient economies all over again . 
  how is the catholic church alienating people in poland if you do n't mind me asking ? 
   `` this , in a word , is silly : germany should borrow money and invest in infrastructure to boost growth . '', 
  this . 
  especially since germany has such low borrowing costs . 
  when the interest you pay is that low , any project that has a positive net present value is worth investing in and there are lots of infrastructure/r & d projects that fit this criteria . 
  second point is that merkel does n't seem to realise the problem that germany 's export led growth is having both for germany and the eurozone countries . 
  this means that german growth is strongly reliant on external demand ( and vulnerable to fluctuations in it ) . 
  not only has this driven up current account deficits in many eurozone countries , but it makes it harder for them to focus on exports as germany is ( very effectively ) doing the same thing . 
  i 'm not that familiar with erc , but surely their supporters will also think twice when the time comes ? 
  twenty or thirty years of economic hell is not something to be easily dismissed . 
  just look at the result of six years of economic hardship has done in spain . 
  not only does it spell doom if catalonia gets kicked out of the eu , but independence while still in the eurozone would be a lot less appealing . 
  i wrote a bit on that very point a while ago [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2hlt4l/catalonia_leader_decrees_referendum/cktx0nx?context=3 ) if junqueras or mas are suggesting that catalonia will have monetary or fiscal freedom as an independent state in the eurozone , they are mistaken . 
  ah , one other question , what does the fact that rajoy is galician have to do with this ? 
  i agree with you . 
  the one thing i ca n't see happening is a unilateral declaration of independence like junqueras is suggesting as even if it worked , it would probably result in catalonia exiting the eu too . 
  who are you talking about ? 
  can somebody from the uk fill me in on how much attention income inequality is getting ? 
  from the distance it does n't seems like it , especially compared to immigration ( for example ) . 
  the bottom 20 percent have never had much wealth but i think the point is that we have seen a growing concentration of wealth away from them ( and the middle classes ) into the top 20 percent . 
  the daily mail may not support ukip , but it has a track record of being hostile to immigration and has thus helped fuel opposition to free movement of labour . 
  for example , in december last year the newspaper ran several articles about [ flights from romania and bulgaria being booked out ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2531440/sold-flights-buses-romanians-bulgarians-head-uk.html ) and plane loads of romaniand and bulgarians wanting to come to the uk to claim benefits . 
  [ none of which was true ] ( http://britishinfluence.org/13-reasons-taking-daily-mail-press-complaints-commission/ ) but they still ran the story . 
  excuse me , but you did write a big long piece about the problems you see caused by immigration , from anywhere outside the uk . 
  this was presented in a discussion about free movement of labour across the eu .
