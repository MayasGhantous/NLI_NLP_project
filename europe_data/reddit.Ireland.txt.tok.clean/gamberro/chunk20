  i found both pretty depressing although in different ways . 
  yes , i studied for a year in both spain and the uk . 
  i was on erasmus in spain but i did make a conscious effort to learn the language and make spanish friends . 
  the first few months were quite a challenge to be honest as it was the first time i truly immersed myself in another language . 
  once i got used to it i felt much more at ease despite all the mistakes i made . 
  i 've tried to keep up my spanish ever since and would go back there if the economic situation were n't so bad . 
  obviously the language and cultural differences were n't a problem in the uk . 
  irish people say that the uk is the easiest place to emigrate to and i would probably agree . 
  i did find customer service to ( generally ) be much better over there , although it was slightly harder to get to know people then back home . 
  apart from that , while you may earn less over there , you generally have good public services , transport and above all healthcare . 
  the un envoy to syria has said that it appears that a [ chemical substance was used ] ( http://globalnews.ca/news/805969/un-envoy-to-syria-says-chemical-substance-used/ ) . 
  while we are waiting for the un to conclude its investigation into whether it is true or not , how about putin present some evidence to the contrary ? 
  thanks for the info . 
   irish cause celtic music and it 's weird . 
  i 've been told a few times that spoken irish sounds a bit like german . 
  but i guess it 's weird in that it 's so unrelated to english and most other languages spoken in europe ( apart from the remaining celtic ones of course ) . 
  actually it turns out that [ finnish was a major source of inspiration ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quenya ) for elvish . 
  unfortunately too many people who use this site have yet to learn from what happened in the aftermath of the boston bombings . 
  look at some of the comments on syria in / r/worldnews to see what i mean . 
  what i mean to say is that a lot of users are happy to issue the results of their own `` investigations '' and not listen to what [ official reports or representatives have to say ] ( http://globalnews.ca/news/805969/un-envoy-to-syria-says-chemical-substance-used/ ) . 
  that was a pretty shocking documentary . 
  anybody ( regardless of their ethnic background or nationality ) who refuses to send their children to school , forces them to take part in crime or sells them off should have their children taken away from them by the relevant social services . 
  at the same time i think the documentary really shows that the social services are failing these kids by returning them to the very people who exploit them . 
  greece leaving the euro would effectively mean it would leave the european union as well . 
  to find itself outside the largest free trade area in the world after so many years in recession is likely to aggravate , not resolve , the ills of the greek economy . 
  furthermore , abandoning the euro overnight would likely lead to capital flight , which in turn would result in gdp decreasing further . 
  on another note , the article does n't seem to acknowledge the issue of competitiveness between eurozone member states , [ such as in diverging unit labour costs ] ( http://snbchf.snbchfcom.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/6678914_435211372d_l.jpe ) , which is aggravating the current account deficit . 
  the greek government alone has relatively few options to deal with this problem , unlike what the article suggests . 
  effectively , it can only resolve this issue by leaving the eurozone ( with the consequences i 've already mentioned ) or by attempting to reduce wages and improve efficiency as is currently being done . 
  there are more policy options available on a european-wide level , such as allowing the core countries to become more expansionary to offset the gap between the two . 
  but that requires money , consensus and above all political will to achieve . 
  upvoted for correcting the op 's spelling !, 
   what are you doing your phd in if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  my question is this : why did n't the property bubble in the netherlands burst five years ago when the credit crunch began ? 
  as we all know , that 's what happened in my own country . 
  i agree and i think it should be removed for the same reason . 
  even if other users on this subreddit feel ` european ' , using the eu flag does n't make their nationality clear . 
  what does everyone else think ? 
  this . 
  every news source is biased in some way but at least western media outlets promote a variety of opinions and are often willing to criticise their own governments . 
  meanwhile russiatoday is unwilling to do that at all with regards putin , medvedev or united russia . 
  simply put , it 's frustrating to see how big russiatoday 's appeal is in the west given it 's huge pro-kremlin bias . 
  as an irishman , it is very interesting to see orwell put [ de valera ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%89amon_de_valera ) in the same label . 
  thank you for sharing that with us anyway . 
  do you mind giving us a rough idea of where you live ? 
  well done anyway and i hope you overcome those issues . 
  you could argue that belgium has `` solved '' that problem by moving towards a federal system , with different regions and communities . 
  it has n't always worked but the king , football team and shared history are there . 
  europe does have other states ( albeit few of them ) that are n't nations like switzerland which is united by a common history , values and symbols . 
  he 's not calling for a fiscal and debt union * per se * , but for completing the political one . 
   the suboptimal conditions under which the european monetary union operates today are the result of a design flaw , ** namely that the political union was never completed . 
  i have always wondered if bilingualism was encouraged in slovakia for the hungarian minority . 
  based on your post it definitely seems to be part of everyday life in certain parts , but it 'd be interesting to hear your view . 
  pardon my ignorance but i thought things were getting better in hungary economically speaking . 
  do you mind filling us in on the situation ? 
  i 'll give it my best shot : * they have a very interesting language that is part of the finno-ugric family , which makes it a distant cousin of finnish and estonian . 
  as a non-indo european language it is reportedly hard to learn . 
  * formed the other half of the austro-hungarian empire . 
  during this time hungary was three times the size it is now . 
  * home of the rubix cube , that thing that every household has but that nobody ever manages to solve . 
  * treaty of trianon meant it was reduced in size with large hungarian minorities left in other countries . 
  * there 's a current spat between the eu and pm orban over the new constitution . 
  * formed part of the soviet block and drew worldwide attention during the hungarian revolution of 1956 . 
  * ruled by mikl\u00f3s horthy during the interwar period who is still idealised on the right . 
  * budapest is famous for its baths . 
  i do n't speak italian but from what i 've read , he often accuses magistrates and people critical of him of being communists . 
  see for example , magistrates who prosecute him or the economist magazine ( or should i say * ecommunist * magazine ) . 
  i 'm curious as to whether `` communist '' is a dirty word in italian politics or whether it 's just him ? 
  i 'm afraid forced labour continued in various forms [ after the congo became a belgian colony ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belgian_congo#colonial_economic_policy ) . 
  i did a lot of research on the free state period so this is n't really my area of expertise but when it became a colony of belgium the mineral resources were developed much more than under l\u00e9opold 's rule . 
  that meant villages had to fill quotas of `` able-bodied men '' to satisfy the labour needs . 
  i agree with the ideas behind the letter , but i must object to their use of the term `` dictatorial rule . '', 
  erdogan may not be a proponent of liberal democracy , and may have a weak commitment to democracy , but the akp was elected by the majority of turks . 
  using such language really seems counter productive and it 's worth noting how erdogan seized on these comments about him being a dictator to discredit the main content of the letter . 
  it 's funny that the reporter did n't mention ireland , although maybe he/she was more interested in other european languages . 
  i am pretty sure the word `` troika '' has become more of a common word now , especially since we were bailed out in 2010 !, 
  thanks to the op for posting this , i thought this was a very good contribution . 
  [ here is a piece this guy co-authored from the guardian . 
  ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jul/16/germany-left-doubt-single-currency ), 
   not true lisbon treaty ensures a free trade deal without prejudice . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  according to teu article 50 , if a country leaves the eu it has to negotiate its future relationship with the eu with the council . 
  the council has to act on qualified majority and with the support of the parliament . 
  i do n't see anything there about ensuring a `` free trade deal without prejudice . '', 
   i do n't think the current government , or at least everyone apart from back benchers , wants to leave the eu . 
  what about william hague ? 
  as tory leader back in the 2001 election , he made a big deal about europe . 
  if he 's not anti-eu , he does want a very significant renegotiation of britain 's membership . 
  same here . 
  where did you go ? 
  ** ireland ** * a major scandal broke out about a [ recording of bankers from a bank bailed out back in 2008 . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/inside-anglo-the-secret-recordings-29366837.html ) it meant that ireland made the front page of * bild * , although for reasons we 're not proud of . 
   atms in latin ; i could n't believe that one , but [ it turns out you 're right !, 
  ] ( http://gizmodo.com/5905595/the-atms-in-vatican-city-speak-latin ), 
  if i am not mistaken , these contracts for infrastructure projects have to be open to public tender from any company based in the eu . 
  in ireland that meant that a number of our motorways were built by spanish companies at a fraction of the cost . 
  if germany did invest more in infrastructure , then that might provide some relief for companies in the periphery . 
  our commissioner maire geogehan quinn tried to say something in irish , but the word for the country is * an chr\u00f3it * not `` croatia '' . 
  mind you , i do n't know if she speaks the language , so i 'll give her marks for effort . 
  thanks for the link and the heads up about the mep .
