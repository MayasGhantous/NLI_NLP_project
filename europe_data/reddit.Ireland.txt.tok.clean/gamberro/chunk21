  i suggested creating a version in italian solely to ensure that more italians see it . 
  the more that do , the better , in my opinion . 
  if i were the dutch tv channel geenstijl , i 'd upload the video again on my official channel so rti could n't claim any copyright to it . 
  i 'd also create a version with italian subtitles just for spite and meanwhile earn money off the views . 
  just saying . 
  thank you so much for your clear and detailed response . 
  that really helps a lot . 
  i 'm actually thinking of moving to belgium next year to practise my second language ( french ) as unfortunately my irish wo n't suffice . 
  i 'm sorry to hear there was n't an ad5 this year but i 'm sure you will get it next time round . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , what area did you apply to work in ? 
  in any case , i wish you all the best in the future . 
  honestly , strasbourg is an example of the abuses of power that we need to get rid of . 
  it costs over $ 150 million a year to move it there for the first week of every month !, 
  were it not for the treaties it would be very hard to justify indeed . 
  as for meps signing in for doing nothing , the same thing happens elsewhere i am afraid ( including in my country 's parlement ) . 
  however , if there was a single seat then hopefully this kind of nonsense would be harder to get away with . 
  i would add that britain only threatened to invade to forestall a german landing or to oppose one . 
  plenty of neutral countries had been invaded in the first stage of the war . 
  de valera was very insistant however , that the british only intervene at his request . 
  at that time ireland was quite unprepared for the threat of invasion , with its marine corps only having ten ships in 1940 to defend our entire coastline . 
  as you can see from the other poster 's `` rightly so '' there still remains some controversy about this unfortunately . 
  i should also add that while ireland was officially neutral , there was a bias towards the allied side . 
  for example , german airmen captured in ireland were interned for the duration of the war , while allied ones were returned to northern ireland . 
  also the allies could use irish airspace and waters around northern ireland . 
  apart from the case of irish servicemen in the british army , some controversy surrounding neutrality remains because of the fact that our taoiseach ( prime minister ) and the president [ signed a book of condolences for hitler ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_neutrality_during_world_war_ii#condolences_on_hitler.27s_death ) at the german embassy after he had committed suicide . 
  for them it was a demonstration of ireland 's neutrality , although it 's attracted a fair bit of controversy since . 
  ** edit ** another thing that you might have guessed from above . 
  since ireland was neutral , german and japanese embassies remained in dublin over the course of the war . 
  secondly , some allied servicemen captured in ireland were interned during the war , although most were returned to n. ireland . 
  do n't worry too much about it . 
  it 's actually called * an modh foshuiteach * in irish and all those sentences starting with `` go '' usually require it . 
  i think we need to recognise that it 's actually a difficult language to learn and also part of a separate language family . 
  i think its orthography is pretty difficult as there are plenty of changes in consonants and it 's hard to remember what causes them . 
  then there 's the grammar which has concepts like the subjunctive that we do n't have in english . 
  try teaching that to speakers of english with its simple grammar and you 've got a lot of problems . 
  i 'm not opposed to teaching irish at all , just in favour of adapting the teaching methodology and techniques to help english speakers learn it . 
  but trying to teach it like its your native language is bound to fail unfortunately . 
   `` what 's happening in turkey at the moment is not in line with our idea of the freedom to demonstrate or freedom of speech . '', 
  i agree , but why not put the breaks ( or even publicly consider putting them on ) on turkish accession talks ? 
  i think most analysts agree that this is a serious political crisis and also a test of the turkish government 's commitment to freedom of speech . 
  whether or not you agree with what the protesters are calling for , i think suspending them until the crisis is over would be the smartest move . 
   invented whiskey before scots came up with whisky . 
  as far as i know , scottish whiskey began to dominate the trade after a [ trade war we had with britain in the 1930s ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-irish_trade_war ) . 
  before that the irish-made stuff held a bigger share of the market and when the price of that went up , the scots were only happy to step in . 
  til michael d. higgins is well known and respected outside ireland . 
  fair play !, 
  exactly , they 're going to need to learn from the german case if/when the koreas are united . 
  yeah , renfe is pretty good in my experience . 
  you can get from madrid to barcelona by train in two and a half to three hours . 
  that 's a journey of over 600 km !, 
  damn straight !, 
  linking two of the major financial hubs of europe by high-speed train is a brilliant idea . 
  oh i agree that all those looking for work or a better job in germany ought to learn german . 
  i 'm just saying that it 's not that big of a barrier on some fronts in the beginning . 
  just saying . 
  a few companies in germany [ operate in english so as not to miss out ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21571930-more-southern-europeans-are-going-where-jobs-are-not-enough-sprechen-sie-job ) . 
  mind you , if we 're to get work in europe , we 'd all be better off learning german/dutch/swedish / etc. 
  yes , the figures are huge thanks in part to the huge size of brazil . 
  but the portuguese language is also growing in terms of numbers of speakers in africa in the countries where it is an official language ( at the expense of african languages ) . 
  from what they tell me in the cities in angola it 's quite frowned on not to be able to speak portuguese . 
  * one of the great powers in the age of discovery as evidenced by the portuguese speaking countries around the world today . 
  * cam\u00f5es is a bit like the portuguese shakespeare and in his famous work os lus\u00edadas he tried to create a national epic for the portuguese . 
  basically he tried to tie them into the iliad by saying that they were descendants of trojans who fled westward after the fall of troy . 
  * very homogenous linguistically , culturally and religiously ( perhaps exceptionally so for europe ) . 
  * it had a very different 20th century , as it was one of the few countries to participate in the first world war but not in the second . 
  * it has a comparatively high level of illiteracy in comparison to other western european countries . 
  * economic struggles in recent years . 
  * the salazar dictatorship meant that it resisted decolonisation and engaged in prolonged wars against rebel movements in africa . 
  conscription at the time also encouraged large numbers of portuguese to move to france and elsewhere . 
  * the national character of the portuguese [ has been described as depressed . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1b8law/hey_reurope_what_is_the_attitude_on_the_street_of/c94rfde ) i found them friendly and cheery though . 
  * lovely food , especially * cozido * . 
  i thought it was only the spanish branch of the habsburgs that did that ? 
  this is a suggestion since i really like this series , but take it or leave it . 
  maybe we could include a link to this in the sidebar for future reference/general interest ? 
  i agree in that integration and specialisation would save a lot of money . 
  perhaps it would also make europe more capable of ensuring not only its owen security but that of its neighbourhood . 
  like it or not , europe ( and even nato ) is still heavily reliant on the united states to ensure europe 's security . 
  for example , small countries like ireland have no need for a conventional airforce and that money could be better spent on other things . 
  pooling resources would also hopefully result in better equipped and trained units . 
   spiegel : will the bundeswehr become part of a european armed force one day ? 
   merkel : our armed forces are controlled by the parliament . 
  the parliamentary restriction lends stability to our decisions , but it also requires different decision-making processes than in other european countries . 
  maybe it 's just the editing or the translation , but it really seems that merkel is avoiding the questions in this ( at least initially ) . 
  do n't forget to come back . 
  actually , please do come back , we need all the tourist money we can get . 
  in any case , i am looking forward to ireland 's turn in [ this series ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1fkf9d/series_what_do_you_know_about_turkey/ ) here on this subreddit . 
  ** edit ** you might want to post something similar in / r/ireland . 
  somebody has been reading ayn rand . 
  yep , my mistake !, 
  sorry about that . 
  how boris johnson can appeal to these kids is beyond me . 
  in the end of the day , he represents a privileged sector of society that most of us can only dream about . 
  remember he 's the guy who called his # 250,000 a year salary from the daily mail '' [ chicken feed ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/8148899.stm ) '' . 
  that 's ten times the [ average ~ ~ monthly ~ ~ yearly wage in the uk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_in_europe_by_monthly_average_wage ) !, 
  the mind boggles . 
  that 's all very true about the current account deficit and the short-term interbank loans . 
  however , turkey does at least have the ability to devalue its own currency and use other monetary policy options to control macroeconomic factors . 
  two of turkey 's neighbours , greece and cyprus , do n't have that option . 
  you 're right and thanks for pointing that out .
