  i was referring to [ gdp per capita ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) ) rather than monthly average wage . 
  however , the point i wanted to make is not that it would be the poorest ( romania and bulgaria are poorer in terms of gdp/per capita ) , but one of them . 
  given turkey 's size and population , that might present a considerable challenge . 
  you 're right , my mistake . 
  i just did some snooping around and found [ this projection ] ( http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/prehaberbultenleri.do?id=15844 ) from the turkish statistical institute . 
  if their projections are right , turkey will have about 82 million people before the end of this decade . 
  indeed , there are considerable hurdles to overcome before we can even talk about membership . 
  if it was a member , it would be the largest ( both in terms of size and population ) thereby significantly altering the structure of the eu . 
  secondly , in terms of gdp per capita it would be one of the poorest ( despite turkey 's considerable economic growth in recent years ) which would complicate free movement of labour and require a huge amount of eu structural funds . 
  thirdly , there is the problem of the dispute with cyprus over north cyprus ( which would have been made much easier if they had n't joined in 2004 ) . 
  given that turkey is now technically in a dispute with an eu member and accession is dependent on unanimous votes in the council , cyprus is in a very strong position . 
  lastly there is the problem about the rise of political islam in turkey with the akp . 
  i do n't think being a muslim majority state is a problem per se ( albania will probably join the eu at some stage ) , but i do n't think the prospect of eu membership can counter this phenomenon . 
  this is an existential question that the turkish people have to answer on their own . 
  one of the things he goes on about is having sharia law being instituted in the uk !, 
  i do n't know if he really is a troll but i do n't think the media should pay any attention to him and it baffles me that he was even invited to speak on this issue . 
  imagine if a horrific killing like this was prompted by racist motivations . 
  would the bbc invite the leader of the kkk to comment ? 
  probably not . 
  but somehow having this guy on the air is acceptable . 
  ** edit ** [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kut5kjb2mk8 ) is an interview from a few years ago where he makes his `` ideas '' ( if you can call them that ) clear . 
  it 's not as if the bbc did n't know he was going to do this . 
  why they let it go ahead is any one 's guess . 
  absolutely , that 's true not only in armenia itself ( though they are meant to be brilliant at chess ) but also in the diaspora . 
  i have armenian in laws who are very proud of their heritage and i would like to visit some day . 
  since it is one of europe 's longest conflicts could you give us an update on the situation with azerbaijan and nagorno-karabakh ? 
  given that [ tensions seem to be still pretty high there ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20528275 ) , i think we ought to pay more attention to it . 
  as for whether we consider armenia to be part of europe , i would say `` yes '' but i do n't know if others would do the same . 
  certainly , i do n't know if you guys will ever be in the eu but i 'm sure we could work out a trade agreement eventually . 
  if they are foreign nationals , i 'd have an agreement with whatever country they are from that they 'd see out their sentence there . 
  mind you , i 'm not a lawyer so i do n't know if that 's possible . 
  * my response is going to have to be short as i am in work . 
  sorry in advance if i do n't answer all of your questions . 
  * de grauwe 's article in the link describes more aggregate demand as stabilising the system , not just from the core countries but also from investment projects and the european investment bank . 
  my point was that stabilising the system would help these countries oversee their structural reform . 
  unemployment in the peripheral countries is already at dangerously high levels , so stabilisation would help create the political capacity for more structural reforms . 
  i 'm sorry if i did n't make it clear in my post , i am actually in favour of labour markets in these countries being flexible and in line with their other eurozone partners . 
  as for your remarks olive oil and apartments , i 'm afraid to say i found them a little patronising . 
  it is important to remember that the export sectors in countries do have industrial bases that would be helped if there was more aggregate demand . 
  have a look at these tables of exports from [ ireland ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/ireland_export_treemap.jpg ) , [ spain ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/spain_export_treemap.png ) and [ italy ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/italy_export_treemap.jpg ) and you 'll see pharmaceuticals as well as machinery . 
  in my country anyway , italian sports cars are still a luxury item that people are willing to pay a lot of money for . 
  finally , an unemployment fund would n't necessarily entail transfers of wealth from the core to the periphery . 
  if the unemployment fund kicked in when a country 's unemployment rate reached 10 % for example , then it could potentially assist any eurozone member state . 
  in germany , unemployment has been over 10 % twice in the last twenty years , so conceivably it would be eligible for assistance if such a fund were put in place . 
  good points , but here 's my two cents . 
  structural problems are a serious issue in the periphery , but not so much in the core . 
  in a number of peripheral european countries there 's a two-tier labour market , which makes it quite difficult for young people to get a job . 
  however , there are other ways to bring about change than to force countries that have dangerously high unemployment to render their workforces more flexible . 
  my suggestion would be a common unemployment fund , that would step in to provide support provided governments implemented structural reform programs . 
  the problem is that the one-size-fits-all approach does n't suit the eurozone at all . 
  while the peripheral countries need to cut back on their spending , there is no need for the core to do the same . 
  but time and again the message put forward is that the eurozone as a whole has no choice but to follow the course of austerity . 
  more aggregate demand in the system would help the peripheral countries restore their public finances . 
  for example , at the moment german three year bonds have an interest rate close to zero and a ten-year rate of 1.5 % , so it gets money almost for free . 
  if these countries became more expansionary it would have a relatively fast effect .

  if that 's the case , then i regret posting this here . 
  the article makes it seem like the proposal was much more serious than that . 
  in any case , can you give us a bit more background on how the proposal was received ? 
  you could n't buy them freely in ireland until the 1990s , unfortunately . 
  you 're right in that we 're very similar . 
  however , i think the legacy of the troubles means that violence still erupts perhaps more frequently in the north than it does in the rest of ireland . 
  with regards racial tolerance , there were a few [ seriously horrible incidents in 2009 ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/21/race-northern-ireland-romanian-gypsies ) when romanian gypsies were attacked in belfast . 
  while there may well be racism and prejudice in the rest of ireland with regards ethnic minorities , i ca n't think of an example of anything like that occurring anywhere else apart from in the north . 
  i 'm curious if there is a significant difference between the two parts of belgium with regards racial tolerance as they are quite different culturally . 
  speaking as an irishman , there does seem to be a bit of a difference between northern ireland and the rest of the island . 
  can any belgians here shed light on this ? 
  first of all , you might want to ask the people over in / r/languagelearning about this . 
  may i ask what you native language is ? 
  gaining proficiency in any of these languages will depend on that . 
  since you 're studying politics and german is on this list , i would go for that ( but that 's just my opinion ) . 
  it is one of the most widely spoken languages in europe and also one of the three working languages of the commission , so you 'd get a leg up if you wanted to do an internship/work there . 
  whatever you decide , enjoy !, 
  i 'm sure you 'll have a great time . 
  exactly . 
  as atomickoala pointed out below , there does n't seem to have been a parliamentary vote on this , so he has no authority to make such statements . 
  we do n't even know if that was the opinion shared by the rest of the delegation or by just mr. barnuevo . 
  ** edit ** grammar, 
  i was under the impression that alsace was actually a relatively poor region of france . 
  apparently i was mistaken . 
  i read an [ interesting article ] ( http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/24197/1/greese_no25.pdf ) on that recently . 
  i think the conclusion is quite interesting ( and partially answers your question ) :  bulgaria 's and romania 's accession into the eu is [ sic ] a reflection of wider security imperatives which led the eu to allow the accession of ` imperfect ' new member states * instead of risking the unpredictable costs of their exclusion * . 
  according to the article a large number of those transactions involved sex . 
  it 's hard not to view that as prostitution . 
  not necessarily , from the article it appears that they are aiming to sell to the wealthy all over the world , including in emerging markets in s. america . 
  that said , the focus on exports as a solution to the eurozone crisis [ may not be as sound as it seems . 
  ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/europe/policy-of-extending-german-model-to-entire-euro-zone-is-folly-1.1386069 ), 
  i could n't agree more with your ideas . 
  i can understand that barroso 's stance irritates many , but i think we need to see this from the perspective of the eurozone . 
  the eurozone can only survive with greater political integration to match transfers of economic power from its member states ( especially fiscal and monetary tools ) . 
  anything else is just going to undermine the democratic legitimacy of the whole project of european integration . 
  the economic policy the eurozone adopts is ( at present ) determined by rules/treaties and not by the people through elections . 
  however , i can appreciate that the eu member states that are not in the eurozone are n't in favour of such a union . 
  perhaps the solution is that the eu will have to have a two-tier system of a federal union and states that retain greater powers ( like the uk/denmark/sweden ) . 
  hopefully this would keep the single market intact and address one of the underlying problems of the eurozone . 
   lower income is better than no income . 
  i agree with you and i think what they did in germany by reducing the working hours instead of laying people off en masse was a very good thing . 
  however , it 's important to remember that politicians often have a limited political capacity to push through difficult measures . 
  unfortunately , spain 's problems are both fiscal and structural , with limited policies available for each .
