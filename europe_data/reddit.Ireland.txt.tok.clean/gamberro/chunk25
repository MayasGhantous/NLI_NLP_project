  there is a dress code for men and women that is [ enshrined in law in countries like saudi arabia and iran . 
  ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/01/economist-explains-20 ) it 's not just a figment of our bias or imagination . 
  the irish times was reporting today that migrants were being turned back into serbia after attempting to claim asylum in hungary . 
  the article stated that they were turned back ( within 20 minutes according to the article ) after being asked a series of questions , including why they had n't sought asylum in serbia . 
  is that true ? 
  have there really been cases of people burning off their fingerprints ? 
  there is nothing wrong with romania or france if you are looking for a safe refuge . 
  but i think it is clear from this crisis that these are often refugees not just seeking safety but prosperity as well . 
  even if we redistribute the refugees across the eu , there is no way to keep them in poland or slovakia when they can easily move within schengen . 
  allowing refugees to pick and choose the destination country seems to be prioritizing their wish over the ability of the destination country to cope . 
  offering the syrians refuge if they get to germany is likely to put the country 's resources under huge strain ( which is what is happening now ) . 
  i have n't been watching it lately . 
  could somebody give me an idea of what it 's coverage has been like ? 
  in this case they are not safely in the eu but outside it ( serbia ) . 
  however , what you wrote is perfectly valid for the refugees demanding to travel to germany/sweden/etc from other eu countries . 
  thanks, 
  do you have a link to that article from the economist ? 
  [ opinion poll from july ] ( http://premsa.gencat.cat/pres_fsvp/docs/2015/07/03/11/13/053e7c6a-7de9-412b-b205-69ea8a1392e2.pdf ) ( before campaigning for the current election kicked off ) . 
  it may be out of date but it is the latest opinion poll i have found relating to this question as the rest relate to how the parliament of catalonia will turn out :  do you want catalonia to become an independent state ? 
   yes - 42.9 %  no - 50 % interestingly , if more options were available , catalans views on independence change :  do you believe that catalonia should be :  a region of spain : 4 % , an autonomous community : 29.3 % , a state in a federal spain : 24 % , an independent state : 37.6 % , do n't know : 3.9 % , do n't answer : 1.1 %, 
   god forbid catalonia should show some of this solidarity to other provinces , who happen to be located further south . 
  over a million catalans are of andalusian descent ( either directly or partially ) as a result of internal migration in spain from the 1960s onwards . 
  oddly enough there is a similar resentment towards fiscal transfers to the south in northern italy , which incidentally is the economic engine of the country and also has huge migration from the south . 
  beautiful . 
  i 'm sorry that happened to you , but i think the 2nd class citizen talk is too far . 
  do the catalans ( or spanish speakers in catalonia ) have less legal rights or are they discriminated against with public services ? 
  compare that with cases of second class citizens ( catholics in northern ireland/israeli arabs are the examples that come to mind ) and you 'll see what i mean . 
  did you enjoy your irish education by the way ? 
  are you still over here ? 
  this is very true sadly . 
  it 's an important election , but it is not the end of the world either whatever way catalonia votes . 
  people may be delighted , people may be upset/angry ( as was the case when other places became independent ) but life will go on . 
  the leader of the cup party , which will be critical in these elections , has also highlighted that they will not support a declaration of independence [ without a majority of votes . 
  ] ( http://www.eldiario.es/politica/david-fernandez-cup-independencia-cataluna_0_416458458.html ) all the opinion polls suggest that cup will be key in giving numbers of seats to the pro-independence side . 
  however , he also said that as long as pro-independence parties get 50.1 % of the votes , then independence will be `` unstoppable and unquestionable '' . 
  i think they will end up with an efta type agreement , like switzerland or something . 
   [ ... ] investment is booming since the possibility of secession was announced . 
  that 's not entirely true or [ at least not for foreign investment . 
  ] ( http://www.lavanguardia.com/mobi/economia/20150320/54429133594/inversion-extranjera-catalunya-cae-15-8-2014.html ), 
  but mas and the pro-independence camp are saying that these are not just parliamentary elections but plebiscitary ones . 
  then he says he has a right to move ahead even if he does n't win the majority of votes because that is what is done in parliamentary elections . 
  do you see what i mean ? 
  are you saying that catalans ( along with others ) who have their own culture are second class citizens in spain ? 
  because that is a pretty big claim . 
  why is that ? 
   `` in a parliamentary election you count seats not votes . '' and in plebiscitary elections ? 
  or elections bringing about big constitutional change ? 
  ** edit : ** i am simply asking a question . 
  i do n't see why i am being downvoted . 
   the thing is , in my opinion , the magazines and journalists who publish this type of messages are rather shortsighted and do n't realize that the worst impacts ( of far-right and radical division in society ) will be carried by refugees and minorities , not white , middle class journalists . 
  i never thought about it that way . 
  thank you . 
  i think the point is that many wealthy arab states are not accepting refugees at all while at the same time [ fuelling conflict/instability in syria . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_involvement_in_the_syrian_civil_war#arab_league ), 
  independence for catalonia or for any other region does n't mean as much as the nationalists here would have us believe . 
  the prominent economist martin wolf said as much himself when he was asked about catalonia , although * independentistas * only seem to have listened to his words about an independent catalonia being economically viable . 
  i put most of the blame for this distortion of the independence debate on the spanish government for not listening catalan demands for more autonomy and trying to prevent a referendum . 
  some of the blame also has to go to the pro-independence parties , who seem to trace a huge amount of catalonia 's problems back to the fact that it is not a state . 
  for example , artur mas said the other day that an independent catalonia [ would n't have had to make a single euro of budget cuts/austerity measures . 
  ] ( http://elpais.com/m/ccaa/2015/09/07/catalunya/1441625347_539329.html ) he seems either oblivious to the fact that many european countries ( including in the north of the continent like holland/ireland have had to do that ) . 
  in fact , smaller countries with big financial centres ( like catalonia ) have been hit hard with bigger fiscal problems than bigger ones . 
  however , for better or worse that is something these users have very strong views on and are very much in favour of . 
  i suspect as much as well about mas . 
  he has said several times that if madrid to keep catalonia in spain it has to offer him something . 
  you seem more knowledgeable about this than me so feel free to enlighten me . 
  the big question for me is whether rajoy make concessions by giving them fiscal autonomy in a federal spain . 
  but then again i do n't have a crystal ball . 
  do you think that 's likely ? 
  britain should be free to follow france and germany or not . 
  however , in an ideal world it should also consider the merits of what its european friends are saying . 
  for the record , i only used the case of iraq as it was the example that came to mind . 
  it also stands out in my memory as one time when criticism of britain from the franco-german axis was strong and well founded . 
   there was no `` lawlessness '' in iraq while the u.s. military was in iraq , and violence was rare . 
  are you serious ? 
  there was n't widespread looting , destruction of ministries , hospitals after the americans took over ? 
  there was no insurgency against the coalition forces or civil war between iraqis in the period afterwards ? 
  patrick cockburn has highlighted that even though the violence decreased in iraq with the us surge , it never died away . 
  the article you mention about ireland does not refer to any public declaration of support for catalan independence . 
  that said , most of us are very much in favor of letting the catalans vote on it in a democratic election . 
  whatever they decide should be their choice . 
  there are a number of reasons to criticize the irish government for things it has done or has n't done ( including on this issue ) . 
  but please do not misrepresent its position . 
   just because france and germany take a different view from uk and poland , it is not the case that the former are right and the latter are wrong . 
  i never said it was . 
  my point was that not all criticism in europe of the uk 's position stems from it not following the franco-german axis ( as the user i responded to was implying ) . 
  in the case of iraq , in stemmed at least in part from the fact that the war was built on false pretences , could destabilise the region and had big questions with regards its legality . 
  i 'd be among the first to admit that blindly following the franco-german axis ( or any alliance ) is a mistake . 
  we later had to negotiate with the british and sign a treaty that effectively abolished the republic , replacing it with a dominion status . 
  it recognized partition , forced members of parliament to swear an oath to the king and allowed for three bases for the royal navy . 
  the content of that treaty was divisive enough to lead to civil war between those objecting to the treaty and those who believed the treaty gave us enough freedom to achieve total freedom . 
  i 've heard catalan nationalists ( including the leader of erc oriol junqueras ) use the irish example several times . 
  somehow they seem to forget that last part . 
  well , isis emerged out of a group based in iraq and subsequently spread to syria . 
  i think it 's fair to say that the lawlessness and violence of the iraq war had a big impact on the destabilizing of the region ( including syria ) . 
  obama has even [ recognized the link between the invasion of iraq and isis . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/president-obama-claims-rise-of-isis-is-unintended-consequence-of-george-w-bushs-invasion-in-iraq-10115243.html ) how is what i am saying implying that we should send troops to syria ? 
  not saying you guys have to follow the french-german axis , but you guys have at times chosen to side with the us over your european partners ( see the iraq war ) . 
  we are still facing the consequences of that decision to this day . 
  this . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11842760/prepare-yourselves-the-great-migration-will-be-with-us-for-decades.html ) from the telegraph said the same thing the other day in that this great migration will be with us for many decades ahead .
