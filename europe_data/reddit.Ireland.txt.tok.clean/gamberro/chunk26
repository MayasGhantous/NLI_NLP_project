  those pull factors will be there driving migrants to the uk as well . 
  what could be done to reform schengen in your opinion ? 
  the united states also has immigrants from poor and unstable countries arriving who often do not speak the language ( and in some cases ) can not read nor write . 
  they are in many cases economic migrants . 
  i have spent time in the states and had a job which resulted in me meeting some who did n't speak english at all after many , many years in the country . 
  i think it 's outrageous given the [ gulf states ' role in fueling the conflict ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_involvement_in_the_syrian_civil_war#arab_league ) that they are n't open to taking refugees . 
  do n't you think that is only a matter of time ? 
  can somebody share an image of the daily mail 's front page today ? 
  manel brinquis of the psc said the same thing [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29915865 ), 
  you mean rajoy ? 
  i know many people who are working over there and it makes me feel uneasy when they describe what a great place it is to live . 
  of course it must be nice to be a privileged minority , but it 's no different from being a privileged minority in any other slave society . 
  according to crazy conspiracy theorists like david icke , there is not . 
  syria was technically a [ league of nations mandate , ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/league_of_nations_mandate ) and not a colony . 
  however , what you are saying is pretty much accurate . 
   `` in order to guarantee increased opportunities and social justice we need the tools of a state . '', 
  i 've seen this argument before from junqueras and teresa forcades . 
  i 'm sorry to say but an catalonia independent from spain , but within the eu and the eurozone , will find limited tools at its disposal to achieve those objectives . 
  one size fits all monetary policy and the fiscal rules will see to that unfortunately . 
  i ca n't help but feel that those who are promising `` independence to change everything '' are deceiving both themselves and their followers . 
  in the best outcome for ( most ) catalan nationalists , catalonia will be admitted as a member state of the eu and as such adhere to the rules of the club ( including the economic straight jacket of the euro ) . 
  thanks !, 
  got a link about the cost versus spanish embassies , lad ? 
  i 'd be interested in reading about that ( i 'm a nerd ) . 
  does n't matter if it 's in catalan or spanish . 
  this article may well be bullshit and you are right to highlight those reasons to believe so . 
  if it is , it should be disregarded . 
  there is plenty of other evidence out there highlighting the fact that serving members of russia 's military are fighting in ukraine and that would n't surprise anybody at this time . 
  however , i think the article is getting so many upvotes because it would be very surprising for the russian government to admit that ( even through a publication as in this article ) . 
  personally i think if/when the russian government does so it will cause a similar reaction here . 
  what do you mean by primary language ? 
  if you mean the main language or one of the main languages , then it 's incorrect . 
  according to wikipedia , catalan is a minority language in perpignan ( spoken by 25 percent of the population ) and by about 22 percent in alghero . 
  that is in part due to the language policies in france and italy as well as language shift . 
  i do n't deny that they are historically catalan speaking places , but i do n't think that is enough to justify citizenship . 
  ** however , ** it would be a good idea for an independent catalonia to have cultural and educational links with those places . 
  sorry to say it , but you seem to be defending this guy . 
  i agree with / u/aleixasv above on that this guy is an idiot . 
  however , it is being blown out of proportion . 
  to be fair it when hungary introduced it it did cause a lot of controversy in slovakia . 
  they even changed the laws surrounding citizenship so that [ slovak citizens who took hungarian citizenship would lose their slovak one . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/10166610 ) ** edit ** i should also say that the irish case is [ based around descendants of irish citizens ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_nationality_law ) and thus mainly benefits emigrants ( or their descendants ) . 
  the law does not grant citizenship to people from areas that were once irish speaking or formed part of an irish kingdom . 
  besides if australia or the u.s. ( where there are a lot of people who benefit from this law ) wanted to ban dual citizenship , then that would be their right . 
  i agree . 
  however , i was trying to rip the piss out of a certain user here . 
  it 's not that simple , lad . 
  you do have fptp which tends to distort the result of elections despite what parties are up to in the game of government . 
  besides i think it 's extra hard for labour to adopt an anti-immigration stance . 
  for one thing , that would mean they would be aligning themselves with the tories and , to a lesser extent , ukip . 
  -- * hello . 
  * * please use the megathread . 
  what do you mean by catalan pro-independence cyclejerk ? 
  from what i 've seen people here are less in favor of it than scottish independence ** but ** they are in favor of letting them have a vote on it . 
  is there any truth to the accusation that andorra is a bit of a tax haven ? 
  how do the people there feel about that ? 
  where are the smugglers from today ( or in the past ) ? 
  spain and france ? 
  you 're right but it comes from an aversion towards keynesian economics ** and ** a recognition that germany is a country that is rapidly ageing . 
  a lot of people are n't in favor of investing in infrastructure now for fear of creating additional liabilities for future generations when they have all retired . 
  people are also conscious of the fact that it will be harder to pay for this once the ratio of working to retired increases . 
  i think that last argument is mistaken , in that it 's not just liabilities that will be passed down but assets as well . 
  a lot of this investment will be required anyway , either to replace/upgrade what 's already there or to encourage economic growth . 
  it would make sense for this generation to make some contribution towards it while taking advantage of low interest rates . 
  if [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_polynesia ) counts , then yes . 
  :p this has happened to me a few times actually , even in europe . 
  i usually say `` ireland , it 's a small country beside britain . '', 
  however , people also tend to get it mixed up with netherlands ( something about ireland and holland sounding the same ) . 
  to help them get the idea as to what stuff comes from ireland , i generally mention u2 , guinness and some irish actors . 
  `` considering force '' is quite different from invading russia as you said in your first comment . 
  mutually assured destruction would prevent the us and nato from doing such a thing ( as it did during the cold war when things were considerably worse than they are now ) . 
  the pp is the party that gets more votes than the others , but that is n't saying very much . 
  they are at 27 percent of the polls according [ to a poll from this month ] ( http://www.electograph.com/2015/08/spain-august-2015-tns-demoscopia-poll-3.html ) . 
  you can try explaining the difference using spanish words if you 'd like . 
  spotted the troll . 
  the belgian economist paul de grauwe ( who has done a lot of work on the monetary union ) makes the same point . 
  very convincingly too . 
   `` i do n't drunk . '', 
  i was in portugal a few weeks ago and was surprised at how many spanish tourists there were . 
  i did n't know it was such a popular destination for you guys . 
  however , from what i saw , most of them did n't understand what the portuguese were saying . 
  the op 's username says it all . 
  german competitiveness is not measured with this current account surplus , but in the volume of its exports . 
  there is no problem with how much germany exports provided it imports enough to fall within the thresholds established by the commission . 
  those thresholds favour germany anyway ( the limit for deficits is 4 percent while that of surpluses is 6 percent ) . 
  germany is `` athletic '' thanks in part to the past excesses of the weaker economies ( or the fat people per your analogy ) . 
  now it seems the weaker economies are expected to become more competitive and bear the burden of adjustment while germany does n't have to at all . 
  germany was helped carry out supply side reforms in the early 2000s when there was large demand from inside the eurozone , especially from the periphery . 
  now the periphery are being asked to do the same when demand in the eurozone is weak . 
  secondly , germany 's surplus with the rest of the world will , all things being equal , make the currency appreciate and thereby squeeze the less competitive economies again . 
  i 'm not going to copy and paste , but i am going to [ link to a comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/34yqck/germanys_record_trade_surplus_is_a_bigger_threat/cqzk67n?context=3 ) where i addressed two of the points you make ( and give reasons as to why this surplus is still a problem even if it is with countries outside the eurozone ) . 
  i wrote a bit about that [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1sgjbt/record_german_exports_exceed_99_billion/cdxhz40?context=3 ) martin wolf ( the ft columnist ) has some pretty good articles about it that i link to . 
  that 's incorrect about ireland . 
  in the last 10 years , [ ireland has once had a current account surplus exceeding 6 percent of its gdp ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ireland/current-account-to-gdp ) ( the threshold established by the commission ) . 
  in the same period , germany has frequently exceeded this same threshold or been close to it . 
  however , we should be sanctioned for doing so if we have breached the rules or have an imbalance . 
  then there is also the problem of comparing an economy like germany 's , with economies that are relatively which is the largest national economy in europe , with that of smaller member states . 
  germany has a trade surplus that exceeds china in terms of size and [ as a percentage of its gdp .
