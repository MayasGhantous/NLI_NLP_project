  ] ( http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/images/0/123/040315_trade_surpluses.png?la=en ) that should be rather startling in terms of the scale to which the country is reliant on external demand . 
  countries can only live within their means by others living beyond theirs . 
  indeed such a large surplus is in breach of the commission 's 30 economic macroeconomic measures , but no real action has been taken against germany about it . 
  the commission has been very adamant in that excessive current account deficits ( especially in a monetary union ) are a problem . 
  they seem fail to say the same thing about excessive surpluses . 
  out of curiosity , how do you identify them ? 
  i mean , do they make mistakes when they speak polish or something ? 
  we 're a small country , folks . 
  even a satellite is impressive for us . 
  are you serious ? 
  spend enough time on / r/worldnews and you 'll come across them . 
  the worst are the ones who copypaste their comments in order to shill . 
  are you ripping the piss out of a certain mod here or are you being serious ? 
  we also do n't know how the pro-russian shills will try to spin this once the final version of the report is released . 
  fair enough . 
  all the best !, 
  how are they denying our nationhood , or even our sovereignty by using the term `` irish republic '' ? 
  i think the term is pretty straightforward as it specifies which of the two entities they are talking about and its status as independent of the kingdom . 
  i am glad you enjoyed * the dream of the celt . 
  * i thought you would have to be familiar with irish history to appreciate it, 
   seeking to `` give '' northern ireland to ireland . 
  that 's the first i 've heard of that . 
  that seems to even go against a major principle of the good friday agreement that `` a united ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people , democratically expressed , in both jurisdictions in the island . '', 
  for the record , we stuck that quote in our constitution ( the 19th amendment ) as part of the agreement .

  i met one of the koch brothers once ( bill koch ) while i was visiting an exhibition of his collection of wild west memorabilia . 
  while he does n't seem to be interested in politics as much as his other brothers , i was astounded at how much money he had at his disposal . 
  the man is so wealthy that he built [ a full size wild west town for his own entertainment .

  i think most people remember that ireland was bombed ( although not intentionally ) during `` the emergency . '', 
  we also had to introduce rationing as part of the impact of the war . 
  churchill made an offer to de valera concerning irish reunification in exchange for ireland entering the war . 
  oh yeah , people also recall that de valera and hyde offered condolences to the germans after hitler committed suicide . 
   [ ... ] we should all read something factual that tells the truth about the eu , like the daily mail or express . 
  the daily mail , the newspaper that runs stories to do with free movement within the eu [ that are n't even true .

  the more people know about this guy , the better . 
  for the record this is the second time so far this year that he 's been screwed over by the streisand effect . 
  [ back in may he tried to stop the media reporting something that had been said in our parliament ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/may/29/irelands-media-silenced-over-mps-speech-about-denis-obrien ) ( somewhat successfully for several days although it had the opposite effect on social media ) . 
  meanwhile his spokesmen were free to criticize what was said or say that it was baseless etc. 
  a parliamentary committee found that what was said did not abuse parliamentary privilege so [ he recently decided to take legal action against it ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/businessman-denis-o-brien-takes-legal-action-against-d%c3%a1il-committee-1.2305142 ) a quick summary for those who are n't familiar with him , the guy built his empire in the early 1990s through corruption ( [ a tribunal found that he had bribed a minister to help get a mobile phone license ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moriarty_tribunal#awarding_of_the_second_mobile_phone_licence ) ) . 
  neither he nor the former minister have ever been prosecuted for this . 
  he has since become an oligarch , owning [ a large portion of the print and broadcast media in ireland ] ( http://dontvotebrianmccarthy.com/?p=1237 ) ( which he uses to control what 's said about him ) among other things . 
  to make matters worse , the guy has taken measures to avoid paying tax in ireland ( including on the money from his corrupt dealings above ) by claiming to be resident in portugal and malta . 
  simply put the guy holds the irish legal system in utter contempt .

  i think something like `` e a\u00ed meu irm\u00e3o ! '', 
  would probably have them flabbergasted . 
  why did the cabinet adviser bring up making people more `` disciplined '' and raising the birth rate ? 
  it seems as if some people able to influence policy in the kremlin are opposed to them anyway . 
  if it is just for economic reasons then they should say so and still encourage people to use them . 
  i 've always been amazed how people can get up in arms to defend something that is , essentially , tormenting an animal or worse . 
  we have the same problem with fox hunting which is far worse than * bou embolat * in my opinion . 
  the fact that * bou embolat * was n't banned along with bullfighting makes me think the ban in catalonia was n't about animal welfare . 
  i 've always wondered if there is some kind of policy of [ plausible deniability ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/plausible_deniability ) in the kremlin that is behind these `` it was n't me '' denials . 
  putin was a kgb agent for many years so he must be pretty familiar with plausible deniability at least . 
  personally i think cameron should be more concerned about children growing up in poverty than being exposed to pornography . 
  ireland still does n't have it 's stuff together so to speak , but a lot of people from harder hit countries have arrived since the crisis began . 
  walk around dublin these days and you 'll come across spaniards , portuguese and others . 
  some are working in jobs they are qualified for ( for example in it ) . 
  many others are working in jobs they are over qualified for such as au-pairs , barristas etc. 
  it is a really shit news channel in my opinion . 
  ** edit : ** maybe this is an old trick of shitty journalists ? 
  i 've talked to people who lived in palestine during the first intifada who told me it was common for journalists ( or photographers ) to pay locals to throw stones at the israelis in the hope of sparking a clash . 
  rt would probably be happy to have her . 
  after all she has experience in helping the cause of the separatists in ukraine . 
   but that 's not the only cause of the country 's revival -- french investment bank natixis has pointed out how much of the eurozone 's recent ( but modest ) growth spurt is ** down to the effect of oil prices and the weaker euro . 
  ** those wo n't last for ever and i think we will have weathered the storm by the time they end . 
  not this scam , but it would be a good way to identify isis ' network of supporters in the west including recruiters and donors . 
  speaking of orwellian :  [ ... ] the setting-up of a so-called ** `` ministry of truth '' ** in madrid . 
  it 's a problem here in ireland too among irish travellers and other insular communities . 
   `` to ensure the cohesion of monetary union , we have to recognise that voters in creditor countries are not prepared to finance debtor countries permanently . '', 
  not the debts per se , but if this monetary union is to survive it will require fiscal transfers . 
  i wonder how prepared voters in the creditor countries are for that . 
   it deepened due to france 's political absence from european affairs since the beginning of the crisis . 
  what ? 
  sarkozy was a pretty big player in european affairs alongside germany in the early part of the crisis ( anybody remember merkozy ? ) . 
  however , i agree that the euro is becoming harder for the french government to see to its people . 
   but the medium-term outlook remains weak , weighed down by the legacies of * insufficient demand , * lagging productivity , and weak bank and corporate balance sheets . 
  many economists have been highlighting the problem of insufficient demand but have fallen on deaf ears on policy makers , especially northern europe . 
  the `` remedy '' for the crisis so far has been to try to make the south become more like the north , fiscally conservative and export oriented . 
  after all , that seems to have worked for germany , why should n't it work for spain , italy or even greece ? 
  martin wolf wrote a very good piece [ here ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aacd1be0-b637-11e2-93ba-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3h7seyqbr ) on why this line of thinking is fanciful . 
  the eurozone is simply too big and too diverse adopt such a model that is generally more suitable to small open economies . 
  but more importantly , the burden of making the south more like the north is being born mainly by southern europe , who are having to suppress demand to do so and thus leading to stagnation . 
  from reading the telegraph article there may be a few other things that were wrong in the original guardian story ( eg . 
  the bribe and luring the lion out of the national park ) . 
  however , i am not making excuses for the hunter 's actions . 
  as it happens i 've been to that national park and am really saddened by this story . 
  as i said elsewhere , i blame sch\u00e4uble for decisions he publicly called for as well as ones he implemented . 
  as i said , actions proposed ( by calling for publicly ) and that he was very much in favour of . 
  i agree that the ecb is independent and sch\u00e4uble does n't control it . 
   a half a year ago , greece was preparing to return to the capital markets . 
  today , the country 's economy lies in ruins . 
  that is the greek government 's responsibility . 
  part of the reason for the dire straits greece finds itself in is as a result of actions taken and proposed by this man . 
  sch\u00e4uble did call for the ecb to cut off liquidity for greek banks , an action which resulted in the shut banks and capital controls . 
  besides a year ago the greek economy had already shrunk by a quarter due to measures demanded by the eurogroup and the troika . 
  surely he is responsible ( at least partly ) for that ?
