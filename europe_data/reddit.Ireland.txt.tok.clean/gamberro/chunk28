  -- grexit will leave the euro fragile martin wolfmartin wolf if greece left it would guarantee default and generate permanent instability for the eurozone . 
  so what should the eurozone do now ? 
  last week i concluded that the greeks should vote yes . 
  they decided instead overwhelmingly to reject the terms of a deal that had been withdrawn . 
  what might that mean ? 
  and how should the eurozone respond ? 
  apparently many , perhaps most , of those who voted believe their rejection would force a change of heart in the rest of the eurozone . 
  their partners would come to recognise the error of their brutal ways and provide them with the resources they need to use the euro freely , while liberating them from austerity . 
  but most of their partners would view this outcome as a humiliating surrender . 
  far more likely then is a stand-off between an emboldened greek government and its enraged creditors . 
  such a stand-off would lead to a `` stealth exit '' . 
  the banks would fail to reopen . 
  then the government would create some sort of ( supposedly temporary ) monetary instrument . 
  later still , people would see that the provisional arrangement had become permanent . 
  finally , albeit after much wrangling , greece would have a new currency , but still be within the european union . 
  only one ( or more ) of three developments could block the path to an exit . 
  first , the greeks could live with closed banks for the indefinite future . 
  this is not impossible . 
  but it is unlikely . 
  second , the european central bank could expand its emergency lending to the greek banking system . 
  if the ecb were a normal central bank that is exactly what it would do . 
  greece has a run on its banks . 
  as the lender of last resort , the central bank ought to lend into such a run . 
  if the ecb believes the banks are solvent , it must lend . 
  if the ecb believes the banks are insolvent , it should arrange recapitalisation -- by converting non-insured liabilities into equity , by selling banks to new owners or by securing funding from the european stability mechanism ( esm ) . 
  unfortunately , the ecb is not a normal central bank . 
  it is the central bank of a half-baked currency union . 
  by protecting itself against losses , the ecb risks recreating the redenomination risk that mario draghi 's `` whatever it takes '' speech of july 2012 was intended to eliminate . 
  fear creates what is feared . 
  third , the eurozone governments could still reach a deal with greece . 
  this is what athens is trying to achieve . 
  but would it make sense for the eurozone ? 
  to answer this question one needs to consider how people now view the currency union itself . 
  one way of thinking about the eurozone is as a zone of mutual solidarity . 
  it is what the greeks themselves appeal to . 
  the reply of their creditors is that solidarity is built upon mutual obligations . 
  the greeks , they insist , cheated on their obligations , both before and after the crisis , so they do not deserve solidarity . 
  this view is simplistic . 
  blame for the mess lies quite as much with irresponsible ( mainly french and german ) private lenders and with the governments that decided to provide the loans to greece with which to bail those lenders out ( see charts ) . 
  this refinancing was of negligible benefit to greece . 
  the solidarity case for meeting halfway is powerful , particularly in view of the slump the greeks have experienced . 
  an alternative view is transactional . 
  each country does what it believes to be in its own people 's interests . 
  the reason for meeting greece halfway would then be that the alternative -- grexit -- would not merely guarantee a large default , but generate permanent instability within the eurozone . 
  shocks would lead to destabilising speculation . 
  a currency union with an exit option is just a more rigid version of the old exchange-rate mechanism ( erm ) , vulnerable to debt crises in place of currency crises . 
  some in core countries even seem to believe fear of such crises would impose valuable discipline upon irresponsible borrowers . 
  leaders of countries exiting from crises want to crush domestic political rivals who promise a soft exit from austerity . 
  meanwhile , france is on the other side . 
  for the french , the currency union was the alternative to the erm . 
  if the eurozone allows for exit , its creation might have been for naught . 
  a big question , in sum , is whether the members of the currency union should want exit risk to be a core part of the eurozone 's construction . 
  i think they should not because such a eurozone would be frighteningly fragile . 
  in light of this risk , it is in the interests of members to seek a solution to the crisis that does not force exit at least until all alternatives are exhausted . 
  they should also recognise that greek debt is unsustainable . 
  debt relief is inescapable . 
  so what should the eurozone offer ? 
  citi 's willem buiter has provided a possible plan . 
  first , no more programmes . 
  second , the eurozone should use the esm to pay off the maturing loans due to the ecb and international monetary fund , so dealing with the liquidity problems facing greece over the next few years ( see chart ) . 
  third , extend the maturities of outstanding official loans into the distant future and cap interest rates upon them . 
  finally , recapitalise greek banks , if needed . 
  the greek state would then depend on its ability to borrow in the market . 
  if it could not borrow , it would have to balance its budget or create a new currency , so putting itself on the path to exit . 
  greece is in the `` last chance saloon '' . 
  the logic of where it is now is definitely towards the exit . 
  but i remain unconvinced that this would be in the interests of greece or of most other members of the eurozone . 
  they should try an alternative . 
  that would recognise the reality that further assistance with greece 's debts is both right and sensible . 
  it would find a way of protecting the banks from its state . 
  it would then leave greece to its own devices . 
  the time devoted to this country should then be spent elsewhere . 
  with debts manageable and the banking system sound , greece may choose its own path , inside the eurozone or outside it . 
  one last chance : that is it . 
  i do n't understand what you are getting at . 
  i do n't know how they can expect a universal declaration of independence to be recognised if the independence would most likely be defeated in a referendum . 
  ** however , ** i suspect that this election and/or a declaration will force the spanish government to allow a binding vote of some kind . 
  ** edit : ** as others here have pointed out , according to the polls published early this month the `` no '' camp leads over `` yes '' by 7 percentage points . 
  regardless of whose narrative it fits , this video should be disregarded and/or condemned if the audio has been altered . 
  i 've often wondered what the reaction would have been if they had downed a plane full of ukrainian civilians . 
  perhaps , in the moral gymnastics of some , it would have been justifiable given their war against ukraine . 
  i am open to the possibility of this changing as you say . 
  but my point was after the 27-s had been called , after pro-independence groups had said it was an effective plebiscite on independence and only a few months before the thing was held . 
  not from what i can see . 
  [ according to el peri\u00f3dico ] ( http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/politica/barometro-ceo-independencia-4325694 ) was done with data collected between the 2 and 24 of june . 
  less than a month ago . 
  the ceo survey from early this month [ shows the same thing ] ( http://premsa.gencat.cat/pres_fsvp/docs/2015/07/03/11/13/053e7c6a-7de9-412b-b205-69ea8a1392e2.pdf ) ( it 's on page 63 for the lazy ) . 
  that is less that three months before the election takes place . 
  i 'm open to the possibility of that changing in the time that remains , however . 
   yes , we 're not spain after all , they can do whatever they want . 
  out of curiosity , what is spain from a catalan nationalist perspective ? 
  is it spain bar [ els pa\u00efsos catalans ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/pa%c3%afsos_catalans ) ? 
  genuine question as i do n't know . 
  this is why i suspect any unilateral declaration of independence by catalan leaders would not work . 
  the no camp has a seven point lead over yes . 
  all things being equal if there was a referendum on this issue on the 27-s , the no side would win . 
  they should ask sch\u00e4uble ( along with all the others in favor of a grexit ) for detailed proposals as to how this is supposed to work , which will then be inspected for their feasibility by the troika . 
  not only would it be interesting to see how they like it , but it would also force them to be realistic . 
  for example at the moment sch\u00e4uble is talking about a `` temporary grexit '' which seems fanciful to say the least .
