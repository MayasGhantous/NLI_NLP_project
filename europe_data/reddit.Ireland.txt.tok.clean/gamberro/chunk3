  moreover you used arguments about immigration in general ( many of which are applicable to non-eea immigration ) in a discussion about immigration from eea countries . 
  how is that not saying that they are one and the same or dare i say equating them ? 
  secondly , i did n't call anybody a bigot but i do believe that it does constitute prejudice . 
  in many cases opposition to free movement of labour is not based on the reality of the phenomenon , as reflected by serious academic studies , but on people 's perceptions of it . 
  given that it has already led to a popular push to restrict eea migrants claiming benefits ( when they rarely claim them ) , it seems very , very divorced from reality . 
  finally , despite what has been written so far , i fail to see how this answers the question as to why free movement of labour across the eu is a `` disaster '' ? 
  once again eu is equated with immigration from non-eea countries when the reality of the two is quite different if you look at the studies ( a net fiscal contribution , lower number of dependants and less use of public services ) . 
  but it does n't surprise me , ukip , migration watch and the daily mail have been very successful in linking the two in public debate in the uk . 
  i do n't see how most of your points apply to free movement of labour across the eu given its realities in the uk ( given that they do n't have many dependants the argument about school places does n't apply ) . 
  also that they are younger and less likely to use public services , the burden on the nhs does n't apply either . 
  how is it a disaster ? 
  despite the nonsense printed by ukip , the daily mail and migration watch , [ every serious academic study has shown ] ( http://www.cream-migration.org/publ_uploads/cdp_22_13.pdf ) the uk 's public finances are strengthened by the numbers of young people going to the uk to work . 
  the uk 's economy is also strengthened by freedom of movement with large numbers of skilled workers joining the workforce too . 
  farage even concedes on this point by saying [ `` we 'd rather be slightly worse off '' with fewer immigrants ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2535110/i-britain-fewer-immigrants-makes-poorer-says-farage.html ) in order to have more job creating societies . 
  the fact is that few parties want to stop the xenophobic bandwagon in the uk . 
  if labour jumps on it , i think it 'll be a sad day indeed . 
  ** edit : ** i 'm aware of the irony of deriding the daily mail and then referencing it . 
  but i expect ukippers wo n't like my post so i thought i 'd pick one of their favourite sources of information . 
  ** edit2 ** i should also also like to debunk farage 's crap in the daily mail `` article . '', 
  it 's been demonstrated that eu migrants [ are generally younger , come already educated , have fewer numbers of dependants and are less likely to avail of public services ( even when entitled to them ) that then rest of the uk population . 
  ] ( http://www.cream-migration.org/publ_uploads/cdp_22_13.pdf ) you have a resource of a large group of people paying tax , drawing fewer benefits using fewer public services who ca n't even vote in a general election in the uk . 
  the only disaster i see is how much they are smeared despite their contribution . 
  thanks for that . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , what was the stance of the ump on this issue ? 
  the only french party that i know was opposed to it was/is the fn . 
  france and italy , what gives ? 
  pardon my ignorance but / pol / is some far-right 4chan thing , right ? 
  other than that , thanks for clarifying that . 
  what kind of cyclejerk did they want to prevent ? 
  hardly . 
  probably they just wanted to prevent an anti-ukip one . 
  i did n't have time to watch the whole thing , but i cracked up at around 6:00 when he mentioned `` heterosexual enthusiasm . '', 
  on another note , he mentioned margaret thatcher early on in the interview . 
  does anybody know what was he referring to ? 
  i am guessing / r/ukpolitics is going mad right now given all the ukippers on it . 
  can somebody give some details on who produced this video ? 
  there does n't seem to be a logo or any other information under it . 
  secondly , are many catalans in favour of abandoning the euro ? 
  what about the eu ? 
  if catalans want to become independent , put an end to austerity , the troika , social exclusion and build a more equal society ( like junqueras and this lady advocate ) they ca n't keep the euro . 
  sharing a currency means transferring sovereignty over monetary and fiscal policy away from catalonia ( just as these are from spain ) . 
  a way around this would be for an independent catalonia to have its own currency , but that would mean going through an economically painful exit from the eurozone ( and somehow staying in the eu ) . 
  i 'm afraid to say they are seriously misguided if they believe otherwise , as monetary ( along with fiscal power ) will not reside with the catalan people , either as part of spain or as an independent state . 
  it is ridiculous and unfair but that is how the bloody euro system works . 
  sure , thats true . 
  but the mentality behind this push towards a closed economy does n't reflect the reality of russia being reliant on trade with the rest of the world . 
  european countries remain very important trade partners for russia , mainly due to geographical and economic reasons . 
  with its links to the other brics , russia is not cut off from the world economy , but it 's hard to see them substituting all the goods and demand that come from europe . 
  i 'd say that different political cultures that the different member states have is a bigger problem than nationalism . 
  however , i think that when the problems of the former become overwhelming , people either resort to nationalism or use it as an explanation for what 's happening . 
  let me give an example : in most of europe after the great depression ( and wwii ) , capitalist governments assumed responsibility over the economy to prevent such crises reoccurring , being willing to use fiscal and monetary policy of necessary . 
  in others ( particularly in northern europe ) , this was never accepted in the public sphere ( see ordoliberalism ) . 
  when the euro was created , not only was monetary policy transferred to the ecb but the policy that was chosen effectively reflected one of these cultures , with a highly independent central bank whose primary objective is to keep inflation below two percent . 
  it really seems like part of the russian government wants to return to the kind of closed economy that existed during the soviet union . 
  the other part realises that the country is [ heavily reliant on exports of hydrocarbons to the rest of the world . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/russia_export_treemap.png ) i guess one side is pulling the strings right now . 
  [ inflation is way below the 2 % target , ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi ) so i do n't think the ecb is doing that job well . 
  also there is a bigger question ( although not in the ecb 's mandate ) as to whether the ecb , as the central bank of the eurozone , has to safeguard the euro . 
  i think that lay behind draghi 's `` whatever it takes '' comment . 
  if the answer is yes , then basically the ecb agrees to act as a lender of last resort , which most of the markets have assumed at this point . 
  additionally , if the ecb assumes this role , then monetary tools might be on the cards or can be expected to be used . 
  i was going based on what the eurozone wikipedia article says . 
  the eurozone is n't s country ( neither is the eu ) so i guess measuring it becomes a bit difficult . 
  well at least crimea is going to form part of ukraine again . 
  again , it 's not the quantity of germany 's exports that 's at issue here , but the ratio of how much it imports compared to those exports . 
  to allow for greater imports germany would have to encourage greater demand . 
  secondly , germany and the netherlands have an excessive surplus according to the macro-economic imbalances procedure which all eurozone member states are subject to . 
  tellingly the imbalances procedure set the limit for surpluses at 6 percent while the limit for deficits is 4 , allowing these countries to enjoy high surpluses just under the limit . 
  now they have breached them and have they been told to correct this ? 
  have they been threatened with sanctions as part of the corrective arm ? 
  the eurozone is too big to allow for the kind of export led growth that germany has benefitted from ( it 's the second largest economy in the world after the united states ) . 
  i 'm not saying that the peripheral countries should n't export more but there has to be greater demand for them to move towards recovery . 
  that demand should ( for once ) come from the core countries , rather than the periphery . 
  it 's worth adding that it 's not confined to flags . 
  there are also plenty of murals in belfast depicting the side ( s ) each community supports in foreign conflicts . 
  really ? 
  that 's the one time of day i would definitely not have a problem . 
  it 's not early in the day and everybody is awake . 
  nope . 
  but i 'm trying to be realistic about what independence means for catalonia . 
  i think claiming that independence will lead to a fairer more equal society , with more money and even a higher life expectancy when catalans wo n't have control over monetary or fiscal policy is dishonest . 
  i also think there 's something strange about the debate on independence if you 're not going to mention the policies that a catalan state would have to implement ( which are ones that nobody really wants to implement anyway ) . 
  if the catalans want to become independent and stay in the euro , that 's fine by me . 
  but they should at least be prepared for what the reality of independence within the eu will look like . 
  the catalan people have agency , i agree on that . 
  however , as i mentioned i [ n another post , ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2hlt4l/catalonia_leader_decrees_referendum/cktx0nx?context=3 ) economically speaking a catalan state would have a lot less agency than people might hope for ( with no freedom to choose fiscal or monetary policy ) . 
  provided it stayed in the eu ( and the eurozone ) it would be faced with the same problems the government in madrid is facing now and the same limited options with how to deal with them ( slashing wages , raising taxes and internal devaluation ) . 
  monetary and fiscal policy would not be controlled by catalans and for catalans any more than they are in spain today . 
  if catalans think that will be different they are mistaken . 
  but i do n't understand why that is better that this `` medicine '' is fed to the catalans by mas/junqueras/whoever , rather than the spanish pm ? 
   british people will have the right to appeal in the uk courts . 
  true and i hope they exercise that right . 
  but i do n't see why you would take away the echr as an additional means of appeal . 
  as for the quote , it 's relevant because the conservative party , along with the press in the uk , makes a big deal out of continued british membership of the echr whenever there is a controversial ruling . 
  my point is that any institution , particularly a court , is likely to come out with controversial/divisive rulings . 
  also despite the daily mail claiming that the uk loses 75 % percent of cases against it in the echr , the reality is that the uk has one of the lowest rates of defeat before the court and that many cases that come before it are rejected as inadmissible . 
  the uk is hardly a victim of this institution , so my argument would be that it should stay under its jurisdiction . 
  given that the british government has violated the rights of its own citizens ( see [ one notable example ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tempora ) ) , i think allowing the british people to have a human rights court to appeal to is pretty vital . 
  ** edit ** i would also like to add a quote from [ this article ] ( http://www.journalonline.co.uk/preview/1014416.aspx ) : `` any court , any institution , is liable sometimes to produce judgments with which reasonable people might reasonably disagree . '', 
  that is true for the supreme court of the united states ( with many divisive rulings ) and is also true for the supreme court of my own country .
