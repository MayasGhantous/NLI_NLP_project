  you 're a great man !, 
  they are small but they are trying to organise unfortunately . 
  some group calling itself `` identity ireland '' tried to hold a meeting in dublin recently . 
  some of the people involved in youth defence like justin barrett were also on the far right ( possibly anti-semitic too ) . 
  there are a few irish guys on / r/european who brigade on / r/ireland now and then . 
  but thankfully we have mainly been spared far-right politics so far . 
  music would be great ( i listen to classic rock mainly but anything is fine ) . 
  i 'm afraid my time is too limited for tv shows at the moment ( i work full time and study for a postgraduate degree of sorts ) . 
  anyways if you ever decide to come to ireland do n't hesitate to let me know . 
  we can sort you out to ensure you have a great time here . 
  i 'm sure you are aware of this already but most irish are in favour of the right to decide for places like catalonia ( probably do n't know much about catalonia though unless they are irish nationalist ) . 
  in nationalist areas in northern ireland there are murals to catalonia and els pa\u00efsos catalans . 
  the largest nationalist party here has some links with erc too . 
  they are indeed , but it was more for practice rather than to gain the truth ( the same way a person learning english might read the daily mail ) . 
  i have a friend from valencia ( another catalan speaker ) who showed me the front page that they 'd photoshopped . 
  what 's a more reliable catalan newspaper ? 
  i know there is a version of el pa\u00eds in catalan but that is a national one . 
  your english is impeccable by the way . 
  yeah , i have a book on catalan ( a gift from my friends ) at home and try reading the catalan version of la vanguardia once in a while so i do get practice in it . 
  all the best lad . 
  thanks for that . 
  i 'll do so the next time i 'm there . 
  i have a lot of friends from catalonia here in ireland ( from tarragona mainly ) that i only speak to in spanish and hardly ever in english . 
  out of respect for their culture i know some words of catalan and follow events there . 
  the reason why i am not learning catalan now is because i do n't live there and as an irishman living in ireland i think it 's better i learn the indigenous language of my country . 
  if that 's the case , so much the better . 
  my ( limited ) experience in barcelona was different as in some cases people would switch to english even before we had a chance to make a mistake in spanish . 
  maybe it 's because of the number of tourists you guys get . 
  france was n't opposed to libya and syria , yet one of the leading parties would like [ to ship them all back ] ( http://www.frontnational.com/2015/04/drames-en-mediterranee-pour-une-politique-dissuasive-dimmigration/ ) while pulling out of europe . 
  i actually came across this article through the twitter of a front national admirer . 
  basically the attitude towards immigrants from these countries is remarkably hostile despite france helping create this mess . 
  many thanks for your reply . 
  i think [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/european/comments/32k0bu/best_way_to_broker_the_subject_of/ ) was the post you were talking about . 
  i do n't know much about how arag\u00f3n votes . 
  care to fill us in on the chances of who is likely to win there on 24-m ? 
  you 're right . 
  but that is a result of the ecb 's quantitative easing , low interest rates along with the fed planning to raise them . 
  what i described above about appreciating would be the inevitable result of the eurozone pursuing export-led growth , all other things being equal . 
  i 've heard this argument many times but i think it is misguided for two main reasons : 1 . 
  this large surplus will likely drive the currency to appreciate . 
  as the periphery tries to export its way out if this mess by following the german model of export led growth , the inevitable result will be the euro appreciating . 
  the largest cause of this will be germany with its large surplus but the countries that 'll be hit hardest will be the peripheral ones with less efficient economies . 
  germany carried out reforms in the 2000s when there was huge demand from elsewhere in the eurozone ( especially from the periphery ) that helped this process . 
  now germany is asking the periphery to do the same when there is n't such demand from within the eurozone . 
  ** edit : ** i strongly recommend you read the martin wolf piece i linked to as he explains this better than i can . 
  a lot of german commentators fail to see the problem with this large surplus , despite the fact that it has breeched eurozone rules in the past ( rules drafted in the first place to suit countries like germany ) . 
  martin wolf of the ft has been writing about this for a while now and wrote a fairly brilliant piece on it [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/aacd1be0-b637-11e2-93ba-00144feabdc0.html ) the article is old but , sadly , is still very relevant to the problems we 're facing . 
  honestly , most of us agree without thinking about it that excessive deficits are a problem . 
  do you agree that excessive surpluses can also be ? 
  `` you see ? 
  she 's not the same as the old fn - even her father rejects her ideas and leadership ! '', 
  by the way , do you think podemos moving to the centre will help it seize the initiative again ? 
  it may come with a price as well as some of the votes it took were from people on the far-left like izquierda unida . 
  i would have thought that podemos ' honeymoon period was over when the information about errej\u00f3n 's bank account came out . 
  still the party is tied with the psoe , which is very impressive given that it is only a year old . 
  so i did . 
  [ here 's the right one . 
  ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_elysian ), 
  the tallest one in my country ? 
  [ the elysian ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32575123 ) in cork . 
  ** edit : ** we 're aware it 's not very tall at all . 
  i do n't know really . 
  we also have a problem with minks that escape from fur farms and are occasionally released . 
  as a north american species with few predators , they have had a negative effect on wildlife over here . 
  accident . 
  if i understand correctly , they escaped from some farms . 
  we also only got them recently . 
  we have buffoons , idiots and gobshites as well . 
   because sweden is well known to cooperate with the us , and the us is well known for kidnapping people and for wanting him behind bars . 
  two things about what you wrote : 1 . 
  if that was the case , it would have been incredibly foolish for assange to go to sweden in the first place . 
  but personally i think that would be more likely in a country ( like the uk ) that boasts a special relationship with the united states . 
  assange still went there as well . 
  this argument was presented by assange 's legal team in the proceedings in the uk . 
  the courts ( and he did exhaust his appeals process ) in the uk ruled the extradition could go ahead . 
  assange clearly did n't care about their ruling by breaking the terms of his bail as he did and claiming asylum . 
  i 'm impressed with her english . 
  do n't care for her politics . 
  i would as well . 
  what he allegedly did would be considered rape in other countries [ including under english law . 
  ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/david-allen-green/2012/08/legal-myths-about-assange-extradition ) the guy has also made a bit of mockery of the british legal system as he exhausted his appeals process before breaking bail and claiming asylum . 
  ** edit : ** i 'm really shocked at the user above being downvoted like this . 
  i think he made a fair point . 
  an even higher number than 49 percent , i 'm afraid . 
  under single seater fptp all you need is a plurality , not a majority . 
  as another commenter here has said , that can be as little as 25 percent . 
  i understand what you 're saying but something has to give . 
  the catalans have held some of the largest demonstrations in modern times in favor of either independence or the right to vote on it ( the right to decide ) . 
  ah lad , it 's not like you 're not being heavily downvoted . 
  although i do n't see anything in your comment that others might find objectionable . 
  the vanguardia the other day had an article that rajoy is thinking of calling elections for september . 
  do you think that 's because of rato or 27-s in catalonia ? 
  either way the sooner it happens , the sooner that absolute majority disappears . 
  here 's a little piece of history for you . 
  a lot of irish nationalists in the 19th century were inspired by the french revolution as they did try send forces in the 1798 rebellion against the british . 
  an irish tricolour was first unveiled at a meeting in ireland celebrating the 1830 french revolution , while the flag we use today was actually designed by a group of french women and given to a nationalist leader as a gift . 
  i 'll be amazed if the pp gets the 8-10 million votes , particularly because of the countless corruption scandals , the broken electoral promises ( remember what rajoy said about vat ? 
  ) , the unpopular reforms and the fact that he does n't have a clear strategy to get out of this mess . 
  mind you they did n't really seem to have a clear plan in the last election ( the manifesto in 2011 did n't really spell out any ) but they still won .
