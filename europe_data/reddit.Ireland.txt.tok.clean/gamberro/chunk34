  i doubt many people here have heard of him , although given the fact that he has millions of viewers i guess he is notable ( if only because he has a big following despite/because of a mentality that belongs in the middle ages ) . 
  i heard of him as i was mildly curious about the propaganda islamists were spouting and noticed that they kept sharing youtube videos of him . 
  ** edit : ** what is ironic about muslim evangelists like him is that they frequently criticise other religions ( plenty of youtube videos by muslim evangelists on how the bible is corrupted ) . 
  but if you try to criticise or satirise islam , the muslim evangelists and their followers will be outraged or threaten violence . 
  what made you leave islam if you do n't mind me asking and how difficult was it ? 
  when it 's not the jews , it 's a conspiracy by the us ( most of the troubles of the muslim world are caused by the us in case you did n't know ) . 
  the prominent muslim televangelist zakir naik came out with the same 9/11 conspiracy theory , only he said it was done by `` george bush himself . '', 
  [ there are even theories that the us is secretly behind isis .

  i am in favor of a two-state solution , of a jewish state and a palestinian state ( which supposedly is also the end objective of the peace process that has been dragging on for the last 20 + years ) . 
  at the moment the palestinians do n't have a state of their own and the current israeli government is working very hard to keep it that way . 
  i should also say i condemn the use of violence . 
  mossad was also behind 9/11 apparently . 
  the list goes on and on . 
  i used to be mildly curious about the propaganda the islamists were spouting ( not only about jews but other things ) . 
  let 's just say i was a little surprised when i saw them sharing videos about jews by white supremacist groups . 
  perhaps not a pro-palestinian activist and instead somebody with anti-zionist or even anti-semitic views . 
  i 'll be honest though in that i am biased in this . 
  i 'm very much in favor of a palestinian state , opposed to the occupation and have attended protests about it . 
  however , even i recognise that the islamists and anti-semites are obsessed with israel and are becoming more apparent at say anti-war rallies . 
  ** edit : ** i appear to have upset people here . 
  i apologise if i offended anybody and was not trying to condone what the person did ( quite the contrary ) . 
  intelligence is n't measured by comment length , senyor !, 
  thank you . 
  out of curiosity , how do people in catalonia see the migrant crisis ? 
  i follow commentary in the spanish press about it but do n't know a lot about how it is seen there . 
  i know many catalans are proud of being a * terra de pas * and people on the left ( like colau ) are open to immigrants coming , but i would like to hear your take on what people think . 
  i 'll be honest with you in that i disagree with letting all of them come . 
  with my spanish friends we talk about something else whenever the topic comes up . 
  what 's your problem with this subreddit or why have you given up on it ? 
  / u/carl555 posted a link to a video of the incident below if you do n't trust the express . 
  i 'm starting to think we need an oath of allegiance or something like the americans have . 
  alright , fair enough . 
  all the best . 
  does anybody else think that this incident will make the migrants in calais more hostile and/or suspicious of the police ? 
  [ ois\u00edn and niamh . 
  try harder . 
  do you think that is coming to an end though ? 
  is n't he based in switzerland though ? 
  i think his comment is newsworthy as it says a lot about how migration is discussed nowadays . 
  the racist label is almost a knee-jerk reaction from some sectors to anybody in any way critical of immigration . 
  i should know as i used to think that way and do the same . 
  to be clear , there are racists among those who oppose immigration . 
  there also people who oppose it for other reasons , or are simply in favor of a different model of immigration ( such as based on skills ) . 
  labeling them all `` racist '' seems like an attempt to shut down debate and serves nothing in the long term . 
  there is n't all that much there to be honest , although i have very good memories and friends there . 
  all the best . 
  beny steinmetz has been involved in plenty of dodgy stuff . 
  good to see the law appears to be catching up to him . 
  valladolid , i 'm afraid . 
  where in euskadi are you from ? 
  nope , i 'm irish although i have family in madrid . 
  the interest in spanish politics comes from the year i spent on erasmus in a small town in castilla y le\u00f3n and from studying spanish at university . 
  for that reason i try follow current affairs in spain and post articles about the same here . 
  i 'm going to try make this a bilingual post for the craic : * para contestar a tu pregunta , soy irland\u00e9s aunque tengo familia en madrid . 
   we did indirectly help the allies a lot though . 
  yes , we did . 
  apart from the official indirect support for the allies , many irish served in the british armed forces or worked over there during the war . 
  yes , the user above is on to something . 
  islamism is now seen as a part of rebellion . 
  here 's a rather disturbing quote from the sheikh of a mosque in wales when interviewed about teens who joined isis :  `` a lot of boys watch jihadi videos . 
  it 's like people watch pornography . '',

  oh i agree . 
  some will go back once things pick up a bit more . 
  however , some wo n't and i think that is a big shame and a loss . 
  many of those who emigrate are highly skilled ( dublin has a lot of spanish people who work in it for example ) . 
  anyways , if things pick up a bit more , i might consider going to spain too . 
  all the best . 
  yeah , pretty much . 
  ireland is my home though and the country i most identify with , hence my flair . 
  thanks . 
  ** edit : ** since st. patrick 's day is coming up next week , i 'll let you in on a pet peeve of the irish . 
  a lot of americans refer to it as `` patty 's day '' which a lot of irish people find annoying ( the colloquial name for it is `` paddy 's day '' here ) . 
  paddy is derived from the irish * p\u00e1draig . 
  * patty is derived from the female name patricia . 
  having said that americans go all out for this tradition , dying their rivers green ( in some cities ) and having parades that are pretty impressive . 
  on the internet we share stories of the worst stuff we 've heard/come across . 
  this is only a small point based on what you wrote , but wo n't the rural catholic vote diminish in time ? 
  the young spaniards i meet ( and i know many from rural areas ) are pretty apathetic about religion and do n't vote for the pp . 
  the way i see it for now the pp 's vote is strong there , but it will change in the long run . 
  however , as keynes said , we are all dead in the long run . 
  one thing that is slowing this in my view is emigration . 
  i have friends from le\u00f3n and they tell me there is a big gap in the population as so many young people have left . 
  i was about to write `` spotted the american '' but you beat me to it . 
  as somebody with american roots , this stupidity/ignorance is saddening . 
  ** unpicking spain 's struggle to form a new government ** * tobias buck in madrid * seventy-two days after spanish voters went to the polls , pedro s\u00e1nchez formally unveiled his bid to lead the next government to the parliament in madrid . 
  the leader of spain 's socialist party admitted he did not yet have sufficient votes to become prime minister but called on rival parties to join the `` government pact '' signed by his psoe with the centrist ciudadanos party last week . 
  `` spain needs change urgently , '' he said in his speech . 
  `` and spain urgently needs an accord that will bring this change . '' mr s\u00e1nchez has two opportunities -- on wednesday and friday -- to win a majority of votes in the legislature , but his chances are seen as slim . 
  spanish voters have simply grown fed up with the country 's political establishment . 
  both the socialists and the conservative popular party lost heavily in december , ending their decades-old dominance of spanish politics . 
  they are still -- just about -- the two largest groups in parliament , with the pp winning 123 seats and the socialists 90 seats in the 350-seat chamber . 
  but both need the support of lawmakers from other parties -- including those deeply opposed to their politics -- to actually form a government . 
  and such coalition deals or government pacts have been immensely difficult to come by . 
  ** why do spanish parties find it so hard to form coalitions ? 
  ** at regional and local level , cross-party coalitions have been common for some time . 
  at the national level , however , there is little precedent for pacts that reach across the ideological divide . 
  for historical reasons , the gulf between left and right in spain is deeper and wider than in other countries -- one factor that helps explain the current deadlock .
