  but there are more prosaic reasons as well . 
  spain 's party system is in flux , with two new entrants -- the anti-austerity podemos party and ciudadanos -- vying for much the same political space as the pp and the psoe . 
  the new order is far from settled , however , and several key parties have reason to fear for their very existence . 
  that in turn has made party leaders deeply nervous about making deals with their rivals . 
  the socialists , for example , have ruled out any deal with the pp -- a stance that reflects not least the fact that mr s\u00e1nchez has podemos breathing down his neck . 
  podemos , meanwhile , is reluctant to back the psoe , in part out of concern that such an alliance removes its raison d\u2019\u00eatre as a purebred alternative to spain 's traditional centre-left . 
  ** but the socialists did get a deal with ciudadanos ** this by itself is not enough to get mr s\u00e1nchez elected . 
  to become prime minister , a candidate needs an absolute majority in parliament in the first round of voting and a simple majority in the second round . 
  with both the pp and podemos committed to voting down mr s\u00e1nchez , even the support of smaller regional and leftwing parties will not be enough to get the socialist leader over the line . 
  indeed , many believe the deal was struck not so much with a future government but a future election in mind . 
  both mr s\u00e1nchez and albert rivera , the leader of ciudadanos , are keen to present themselves to spanish voters as two pragmatic , constructive politicians who did their best to sort out the country 's political mess while their rivals stood on the sidelines . 
  in the case of podemos , mr s\u00e1nchez is already making political hay with the fact that his leftwing rivals will join forces with the conservative pp to vote down a `` progressive '' government . 
  the latest polls suggest that at least some podemos voters share his disappointment . 
  ** what about rajoy ** not for the first time in his career , spain 's acting prime minister is playing a waiting game . 
  in january he declined the king 's offer to form a new government , arguing it made more sense for the socialists to go first . 
  the pp leader says he is ready to present his candidacy once mr s\u00e1nchez fails . 
  with that day now fast approaching , does the veteran leader stand a chance ? 
  mr rajoy says he wants to form a three-way alliance between his own pp , the socialists and ciudadanos . 
  he argues they have more in common than appears at first sight -- most notably their firm opposition to the catalan independence movement and their commitment to economic stability and the eu . 
  in abstract terms , that makes some sense . 
  a pp-psoe-ciudadanos alliance would also be popular with key eu partners and with spanish business leaders . 
  the problem is that the pp , which has been beset by corruption scandals for years , is once again at the centre of new graft revelations . 
  not even ciudadanos , which is close to the pp on many key issues , believes mr rajoy is still the right man to lead spain . 
  ** so what happens after the vote ? 
  ** the key moment to watch is the second round of voting on friday . 
  some socialists still hope they can somehow get podemos to abstain , thus giving mr s\u00e1nchez a fighting chance of winning the premiership . 
  a last-minute podemos u-turn can not be ruled out but it seems highly unlikely . 
  once mr s\u00e1nchez loses the second round of voting , he also loses his royal mandate to form the government . 
  felipe vi can then either pass the baton to mr rajoy , or wait for party leaders to signal who among them has the best chances of winning that elusive majority . 
  either way , the countdown to new elections starts after the first vote . 
  unless there is a surprise breakthrough , spaniards will go to the polls for a second time -- most likely on june 26 -- and the country will endure at least several more months of political uncertainty . 
   the letter specifies that , for everyday crimes such as burglary , basic information such as ethnicity , nationality , skin colour and height should not be given . 
  if a suspect is at large , will these policies not make it difficult for them to be apprehended ? 
  if you have a news article about it , you can pm it to me . 
  do n't worry , no need to post it then . 
  unfortunately , plenty of european citizens have taken part in atrocities in syria/iraq . 
  i 'm willing to entertain the possibility that some of the migrants arriving might have done the same . 
   many people are n't proper screened and were perpetrators in their country . 
  can we expect otherwise given the approach that we have taken ? 
  the borders of the schengen zone are/were not secure allowing large numbers of people from war zones as well as economic migrants to cross . 
  the serious screening takes place when they get to sweden/germany/wherever and their asylum request is processed . 
  since many have no documents , have not been screened and they are not held in secure units , we have no idea who these people are walking the streets . 
  the asylum policies of sweden and germany have acted as a pull factor , making this situation worse not better . 
  ** edit : ** do you have a source on the man who took a selfie by the way ? 
   in addition , why would the katangese desire for independence be any less legitimate than that of congo as a whole ? 
  it would n't be * per se , * particularly if it were driven by the democratic will of the people there . 
  however , the secession of katanga took place unilaterally and a mere 11 days after congo 's independence had been declared . 
  there were also strong links between tshomb\u00e9 and the belgian government/commercial interests . 
  rather than a case of self-determination , katanga appears more like a case of a former colonial power destabilising its former colony . 
   try to say no to the victor of ww2 , your foremost ally . 
  they were concerned he was going to turn to moscow . 
  the united states did plot to assassinate lumumba and were probably happy to have him dead . 
  however , if you read ludo de witte 's book , it 's pretty clear that the main instigators of his death and indeed the people who carried out his execution/dismemberment were belgian . 
  tell that to the conservative and unionist party of which boris johnson aspires to lead . 
   some of these have `` disappeared '' from the reception centres where they were housed . 
  many more arrived without filing an asylum request . 
  `` they never get into ` the system ' , '' says kjell-terje torvik , the national coordinator for unaccompanied children at the migration agency . 
  house them in secure centres , people !, 
  it seems to be the only way to keep track of those in the system . 
  i do n't know what the solution is for those not in the system but to control the borders . 
  i was once very , very left wing , europhilic to the extreme and associated anybody who was opposed to immigration with racism . 
  ** edit : ** i still vote for left wing parties , believe european integration overall has been a good thing and naturally abhor racism . 
  however , i realise now that immigration is a complex topic and accusing people of racism for thinking the same only serves to shut down debate . 
   it had been agreed that belgium would transfer power to the congolese years beforehand : the administration , army and officer corps was being trained to make the transition possible . 
  do you have a source on that ? 
  because there were precious few congolese college graduates at the time of independence . 
  according to [ this newspaper article from 1961 ] ( https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&amp;dat=19610428&amp;id=9jctaaaaibaj&amp;sjid=zmyeaaaaibaj&amp;pg=1227,6181859&amp;hl=en ) the number was as low as 19 . 
  there were also very few army officers that had advanced beyond non-commission officers by the time independence came . 
  if there was a plan to transfer power to the congolese years beforehand , it does n't seem to have been followed on the ground . 
  secondly , belgium did not try to hold onto power * directly * but perhaps that was out of fear out of being bogged down in a colonial war in a territory the size of western europe . 
  thirdly , the belgian government did fester the chaos that followed after independence , exerting a lot of indirect influence and supporting tshomb\u00e9 / katanganese separatists . 
  it should be mentioned also that belgian officials and officers played a big role in the death of lumumba ( the first pm there ) . 
  part of the territory in the north-east is the [ lado enclave ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lado_enclave ) . 
  horrible activities did extend to the grey areas on the map albeit differently from the areas assigned to the companies for the collection of rubber or ivory . 
  the natives throughout the congo free state were expected to pay tax in the form of labour and that is most likely predominated in the grey areas . 
  what this might mean varied from providing chopped wood for steamers , food for the nearest outpost or working on the construction of something . 
  ** edit : ** i 've also come across accounts of natives leaving the areas controlled by the companies to escape the atrocities or slave regime there . 
  the anglo-irish diplomat roger casement mentioned the same in his report on the congo ( he visited lake mantumba , near the king 's territory ) . 
  i did a dissertation on the congo free state once so i am interested in this conversation . 
  i would just like to point out that leopold was a shareholder in many of these companies and that he also held a territory for himself called the [ domaine de la couronne .

  the two terms are a bit mixed up . 
  generally , the term `` republican '' in ireland is used to refer to those in favour of achieving a united ireland through violence . 
  as you say fianna f\u00e1il still uses the slogan `` the republican party '' but has moved away from that . 
  for the record , the good friday agreement was approved by referendum both in northern ireland as well as in the republic . 
  are the people who voted in favour of it not nationalists ? 
  the republic gave up its territorial claim to the north , but it replaced it with an article saying that the `` firm will of the irish nation '' is to achieve reunification by democratic means . 
  jesus ... did anything happen to the embassy staff after what happened ? 
  declaring the guy who attacked the reporter * persona non grata * is well called for here . 
  jesus , are they really ? 
  you guys could probably use this in scottish parliamentary elections , right ? 
  what i mean to ask is whether the scottish government has the authority to shape its electoral system . 
  is that a result of our electoral system though ? 
  i think that that 's more the result of the fact that local authorities/councils do n't have much power here . 
  no different than the illegal immigrants who get to ireland via the uk and vice versa . 
  i might take to using that term to refer to them then . 
  ** merkel insists no change of course on migrant crisis ** * guy chazan in berlin * german chancellor angela merkel said she had no `` plan b '' for solving the refugee crisis , and insisted there was nothing that would make her change course -- despite growing popular anger in germany at her government 's handling of the issue . 
  speaking on a talkshow on germany 's ard tv channel , ms merkel said she could `` understand '' a recent poll which showed 81 per cent believed her government had lost control of the migrant crisis . 
  but she rejected the proposal backed by many in germany to introduce an upper limit on migration . 
  there was no point , she said , in making a promise she could n't keep .
