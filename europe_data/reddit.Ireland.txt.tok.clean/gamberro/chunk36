  `` i have no plan b , '' she said . 
  `` there 's no sense in working on two [ plans ] at the same time . '' ms merkel also admitted that the refugee crisis was the worst she had faced in her 10 years as chancellor , dwarfing even the eurozone debt problem . 
  the interview came at a time when the chancellor is finding herself increasingly isolated , both at home and abroad , over her open-door refugee policy . 
  austria has in recent days joined nine neighbouring states in imposing border controls , in a move that put in doubt the future of the schengen passport-free travel zone and raised fears that tens of thousands of refugees will be bottled up in greece . 
  athens recalled its ambassador to vienna in protest at the move . 
  ms merkel criticised the austrian action , saying greece had been let down . 
  `` we did n't keep greece in the euro in order to leave it in the lurch like that , '' she said . 
  `` that is not my europe . '' the chancellor also rejected the suggestion that austria and its neighbours had `` solved her problem for her '' since the number of migrants entering germany had fallen significantly since its neighbours choked off the flow across their borders . 
  the interview came two weeks before elections in three german states which are emerging as a referendum on ms merkel 's refugee policy . 
  polls suggest the eurosceptic alternative f\u00fcr deutschland , which wants tough restrictions on immigration , could see big gains . 
  despite the flurry of unilateral moves by european governments , ms merkel is still insisting on an eu plan to solve the crisis , involving $ 3bn of aid and other perks for turkey in exchange for a crackdown on human trafficking into greece ; moves to strengthen the eu 's external border ; and a scheme to resettle some 160,000 migrants now in greece and italy across the eu . 
  a nato mission was deployed last week to help the greek and turkish coastguards stop human smuggling across the aegean sea . 
  a crucial eu-turkey summit on march 7 is being widely seen as the last chance to revive the common eu response before warmer spring weather leads to a big upsurge in new arrivals across the mediterranean . 
  germany 's interior minister thomas de maizi\u00e8re said last week he wanted to see a significant reduction in refugee numbers by the march 7 meeting . 
  but the flurry of national moves in recent days suggests that time might be running out for the common eu policy ms merkel and eu commission president jean-claude juncker are advocating . 
  but ms merkel said she still had faith the eu plan would work and `` sees nothing '' that would make her change course . 
  you 're absolutely right although lowry is facing criminal prosecution so hopefully that rules him out of any government . 
  the spanish election in december is an obvious ( and recent ) comparison of an election producing no clear winner . 
  out of curiosity , why do you think that is a good thing ? 
  this is something i do n't understand about the german government 's message of solidarity and outpouring of supplies when faced with the migrant crisis . 
  sure , there was a humanitarian crisis with regards refugees from syria/iraq and were in need of assistance . 
  but in greece there already was/is a humanitarian crisis as a result of austerity and stagnation but the position of the german government is very different . 
  is it not also the case that european governments are rolling out the red carpet for a dictatorial state that is actively causing a major security threat in europe ? 
  let 's be honest about it , saudi arabia is a missionary state that is exporting religious fundamentalism ( wahabbism ) , which is a major source for global terrorism . 
  see ? 
  even jihadists can be apple fanboys . 
  i 'm sorry about that . 
  i decided to share it as i 'm afraid it 's still relevant today . 
  never knew about that . 
  thank you . 
  how has she killed off her rivals inside the cdu out of curiosity ? 
   you do understand it 's a real liability and security issue to let migrants and refugees with no papers and background checks into any country right ? 
  it 's a real liability and security issue to let hundreds of thousands with no identification into the country and let them roam the streets instead of being kept in a secure centre . 
  did n't two of the paris attackers arrive in greece as migrants ? 
  were they ever held in a secure centre at any point between greece and france ? 
  if i 'm not mistaken , there is n't as much cctv in germany in public places as in other countries . 
   non-compatible social engineering . 
  what do you mean out of curiosity ? 
  i 've heard of cases at anti-war demonstrations where jews have been singled out and insulted . 
  as somebody who votes for left-wing parties , that is quite disturbing . 
  for that reason part of me would like the oath people swear at naturalisation ceremonies to include a commitment of respect for all , regardless of race , gender , sexual orientation etc. 
  ** the left 's problem with jews has a long and miserable history ** * simon schama * much of the student left has `` some kind of problem with jews '' , said the bravely decent alex chalmers last week in his resignation statement as co-chair of the oxford university labour club following a vote in favour of israeli apartheid week . 
  labour 's national student organisation is launching an inquiry but the `` the problem with jews '' on the left is not going away . 
  in january a meeting of the kings college london israel society , gathered to hear from ami ayalon , a former head of shin bet , the israeli domestic intelligence service , who now champions a two-state solution , was violently interrupted by a chair-hurling , window-smashing crowd . 
  last summer the guardian columnist owen jones made a courageous plea for the left to confront this demon head on . 
  since then , however , criticism of israeli government policies has mutated into a rejection of israel 's right to exist ; the fatah position replaced by hamas and hizbollah eliminationism . 
  more darkly , support in the diaspora for israel 's right to survive is seen by the likes of labour 's gerald kaufman , who accused the government of being influenced in its middle eastern policy by `` jewish money '' , as some sort of jewish conspiracy . 
  the charge that anti-zionism is morphing into anti-semitism is met with the retort that the former is being disingenuously conflated with the latter . 
  but when george galloway ( in august 2014 during the last gaza war ) declared bradford `` an israel-free zone '' ; when french jews are unable to wear a yarmulke in public lest that invite assault , when holocaust memorial day posters are defaced , it is evident that what we are dealing with is , in professor alan johnson 's accurate coinage , `` anti-semitic anti-zionism '' . 
  the fact is that the terrorists who slaughtered customers at the kosher supermarket in paris did not ask their victims whether they were israelis , much less supporters of israeli government policies . 
  they were murdered as jews because in the attackers ' poisoned minds all jews are indivisibly incriminated as persecutors of the palestinians and thus fair game for murder . 
  when the international boycott , divestment and sanctions movement singles out israel as the perpetrator of the world 's worst iniquities , notwithstanding its right of self defence , it is legitimate to ask why the left 's wrath does not extend , for example , to russia which rains down destruction on civilian populations in syria ? 
  why is it somehow proper to boycott israeli academics and cultural institutions , many of which are critical of government policy , but to remain passive in the face of saudi arabia 's brutal punishment of anyone whose exercise of freedom of conscience can be judged sacrilegious ? 
  why is the rage so conspicuously selective ? 
  or , to put it another way , why is it so much easier to hate the jews ? 
  growing up in london in the shadow of world war two my pals and i talked about who might be the bad guys , should evil come our way . 
  we agreed the jew-haters would not wear brown shirts and jackboots but would probably be like people on the bus . 
  it is not the golf club nose-holders we have to worry about now ; it is those who , in their indignation at the sufferings visited on the palestinians , and their indifference to almost-daily stabbings in the streets of israel , have discovered the excitement of saying the unspeakable , making hay with history , so israel is the new reich , and a military attack on gaza indistinguishable from the industrially processed incineration of millions . 
  enter the historian . 
  and history says this : anti-semitism has not been caused by zionism ; it is precisely the other way round . 
  israel was caused by the centuries-long dehumanisation of the jews . 
  the blood libel which accused jews of murdering christian children in order to drain their blood for the baking of passover matzo began in medieval england but never went away , reviving in 16th century italy , 18th century poland , 19th century syria and bohemia , and 20th century russia . 
  in 1980s syria , mustafa tlass , hafez al-assad 's minister of defence , made his contribution with the matzo of zion , and last year the israeli-palestinian islamist raed salah , once invited to parliament by jeremy corbyn as an `` honoured citizen '' , declared that jews used blood for the dough of their `` bread '' . 
  in the 19th century virtual vampirism was added to the antisemitic canon . 
  and the left made its contribution to this refreshment of old poison . 
  demonstrating that you do not have to be gentile to be an anti-semite , karl marx characterised judaism as nothing more than the cult of mammon , and declared that the world needed emancipating from the jews . 
  others on the left -- the social philosophers bruno bauer , charles fourier and pierre prudhon and the anarchist mikhail bakunin -- echoed the message : blood sucking , whether the physical or the economic kind , was what jews did . 
  for the jews , the modern world turned out to be a lose-lose proposition . 
  once reviled for obstinate traditionalism ; their insistence on keeping walled off from the rest ( notwithstanding that it had been christians who had done the walling ) they were now attacked for integrating too well , speaking , dressing and working no differently but always with the aim of global domination . 
  what was a jew to do ? 
  the communist moses hess , who had been marx 's editor and friend , became persuaded , all too presciently , that the socialist revolution would do nothing to normalise jewish existence , not least because so many socialists declared that emancipating the jews had been a terrible mistake . 
  hess concluded that only self-determination could protect the jews from the phobias of right and left alike . 
  he became the first socialist zionist . 
  but that was to inflict an entirely colonial and alien enterprise upon a palestinian population , so the hostile narrative goes , who were penalised for the sins of europe . 
  that the palestinians did become tragic casualties of a judeo-arab civil war over the country is indisputable , just as the 700,000 jews who were violently uprooted from their homes in the islamic world is equally undeniable . 
  but to characterise the country in which the language , the religion and the cultural identity of the jews was formed as purely a colonial anomaly is the product of the kind of historical innocence which is oblivious of , say , jewish kabbalistic communities in galilee in the 16th century or the substantial native jewish majority in jerusalem in the late 19th century . 
  none of this unbroken history of jews and judaism in palestine is likely to do much to cool the heat of the anti-colonial narrative of the alien intruder , especially on the left . 
  with the collapse of the soviet union and the retreat of marxist socialism around the world , militant energies have needed somewhere to go . 
  the battle against inequalities under liberal capitalism has mobilised some of that passion , but postcolonial guilt has fired up the war against its prize whipping boy , zionism , like no other cause . 
  every such crusade needs a villain along with its banners and i wonder who that could possibly be ? 
  year , i was in lisbon last summer ( twice in fact ) and i did n't see any either . 
   while some days ago i heard one of this girl speaking portuguese ( of course it was kind of rough but still ) . 
  you mean a girl with a burka ? 
  plenty of spaniards and irish too . 
  lots of young people i know from here and spain now live in the uk . 
  it 's not at all surprising either given the huge unemployment in southern europe and better opportunities elsewhere . 
   turkey was able to confirm the link only a few hours after the attack ? 
  that reminds me of the 2004 madrid bombings when the then spanish prime minister blamed eta . 
  it turned out to have nothing to do with eta . 
  ** edit : ** for those who do n't know about it , there 's more on that [ here . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_madrid_train_bombings#allegations_of_eta_involvement ), 
  what dataset did you use out of curiosity ? 
  i agree with you but i think her argument about how she ca n't be racist is simply ridiculous statement . 
  can an ethnic minority person then use racist language as the n word as much as they like ? 
  can they physically attack or discriminate against other groups ? 
  or does the definition of racism imply `` prejudice against someone of a different race '' irrespective of the ethnicity/race of who holds such views ? 
  to be honest , i 'm amazed she was taken seriously after that comment . 
  i do n't have time for the edl or mr. robinson but that second video was painful to watch . 
  islamism is a supremacist ideology ( many times islamists come out with it by expressly saying `` power should be in the hands of muslims . '' ), 
  for me that is just as supremacist as saying power should be in the hands of christians or white people .
