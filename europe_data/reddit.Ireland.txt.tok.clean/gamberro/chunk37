  but for some reason people are a lot less hostile to islamism than say racial supremacist ideologies . 
  they should have no problem with his statues and place names being removed then . 
  thank you for the reply . 
  who uses that term ? 
  politicians ? 
  newspaper columnists ? 
  does anybody really call them that ? 
  why do you say that out of curiosity ? 
  do n't worry , romania was n't the only country to have fascists go fight in the spanish civil war . 
  [ some also went from my country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eoin_o%27duffy ) and there were also pro-nationalist rallies here . 
  eastern europe removes statues and place names from when they were under the eastern block ( and consequently totalitarian states ) . 
  i do n't see why spain should n't do the same for street names from the era when it was totalitarian . 
  was murdering people for their political ideas , imprisoning them in camps , denying democracy for almost 40 years and banning people 's native language a `` necessary lesser evil '' ? 
  ** edit : ** typo . 
  a very well written post as always . 
  i 'd like to challenge you on a few points if i may . 
  i should point out that i traditionally for left wing parties in ireland but also that i have american roots , so i understand the cultural references you refer to . 
  the left does have to `` grow balls '' as you put it and defend values it supposedly upholds like secularism , equality and religious freedom ( including the right to leave religion ) in the face of religious fundamentalism . 
  for too long it has avoided this issue . 
  but the polarisation of politics or `` not wanting to side with the people you were bashing before '' very much applies to the political right as well . 
  how many republican presidential nominees recognise that the absence of a universal healthcare system left millions of people without access to healthcare ? 
  or better still that us ' military interventions in the middle east have been a complete disaster ? 
  many seem prepared to make the same mistakes again . 
  the absence of a centre willing to find common ground in america is troubling in my opinion . 
  but back to europe where the left is blamed for multiculturalism , immigration and consequently undermining social cohesion . 
  but in the countries where it governs the right is also undermining social cohesion with austerity , `` slimming down '' the state and dismantling the welfare state that was built after wwii . 
  all this while it 's creating an ever widening gap between the rich and poor . 
  the right ( in the uk and elsewhere ) may want to be seen as protecting the state from being undermined by opposing immigration , but in some ways it is doing that itself . 
  finally , in the eurozone countries these policies have created prolonged stagnation ( `` a lost decade '' ) overall and socio-economic crises in some countries . 
  that is what explains podemos , the fn and many others . 
  is that still the case though ? 
  as i understand a lot of the brazilians in gort left after the crash . 
  however , you 're correct in that there are a lot of brazilians and venezuelans in ireland . 
  as others here have pointed out , there is a tv show about this topic called `` love/hate '' and it 's pretty popular in ireland . 
  if you 're into that kind of thing , i 'd recommend checking it out . 
  well , at least you are projected to have healthier demographics by 2060 . 
   `` we can open the doors to greece and bulgaria anytime and we can put the refugees on buses '' . 
  if they did do that , would we be able to stop them ? 
  i mean , either by shutting the border or sending the refugees back to turkey ? 
  if the turkish government did that they would be deliberately aggravating the migrant crisis in europe . 
  hmm ... george galloway and islamist organisations . 
  i 'm not surprised but as somebody who votes left wing , i 'm really angry about this hypocrisy on the left . 
  i mean , the embrace of islamist intolerance while supposedly campaigning for equality . 
  galloway 's respect party has links to islamist organisations including the ( now defunct ) islamic party of britain . 
  [ if her reaction to cologne is anything to go by , ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2016/01/after-cologne-we-cant-let-bigots-steal-feminism ) feminists like laurie penny ( and other guardian columnists ) would accuse us of hypocrisy for not supporting female candidates before if we said anything about this . 
  is it a muslim problem or a pakistani/bangladeshi/other minority community problem ? 
  ** edit : ** my point is that the patriarchal views in these communities are the real underlying problem . 
   `` because i did n't have my father 's consent and support , i had to step down . 
  i was pressured into stepping down . '', 
  this is heartbreaking but also infuriating . 
  clearly the patriarchal views of the cultures these minority communities originate from are very much alive in the uk . 
  i remember one female politician ( salma yaqoob ) describing how she had to challenge her father to be able to study at university . 
  she managed to do so , but i worry about the other girls in the uk who have their plans for the future overturned by their male relatives . 
  where does armenia fit into this ? 
  i do n't know much about the country but noticed it was not on your list . 
  you ca n't claim it ? 
  dude , i 've seen lethal weapon 2 and i know my rights with regards [ diplomatic immunity . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/kwc_iay3bmy ), 
   how is `` western foreign policy '' an excuse when it 's totally valid reason to analyze . 
  usa has funneled money to afghanistan extremist to oust communists , supports saudis that funnel money all around to various extremist groups . 
  yes , just as the soviet union funneled money to impose communism or oust governments in many countries ( including the west ) . 
  the eastern bloc also provided substantial funding and training to such groups . 
  when left wing groups carry out attacks ( as they have done in the past ) , do we blame the legacy of soviet foreign policy , these people 's marginalisation/discrimination or do we blame the ideology ? 
  the bosnian and cambodian genocides happened as well . 
  however , i think what the user above is saying is that despite the hopes of many after wwii that the atrocities and persecutions would not happen again ( not least against this ethnic group ) , we appear to have failed or be failing . 
  i , for one , am not afraid of muslims . 
  i am afraid of islamism and intolerance . 
  there is a huge difference between the two . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/17d6tg/why_werent_the_palestinian_refugees_resettled_or/ ) is an old thread from / r/askhistorians on why the palestinian refugees were n't resettled . 
  you know what i find infuriating ? 
  the excuses that are given for this extremism by pointing to marginalisation , racism or western foreign policy . 
  those are , at best , half-truths . 
  the other important truth is that islamism is on the rise among muslim communities and islamic fundamentalism remains ( by 21st century standards ) incredibly violent . 
  it 's the latter that is putting the jewish community in france under siege . 
  ** edit : ** grammar . 
  [ relevant .

  hmm ... yeah , about that ... 
  ** macedonia struggles to hold back migrants to the eu ** * andrew byrne in gevgelija * in an empty ex-yugoslav army barracks in macedonia 's vardar valley , an enormous 1960s telephone terminal sits unplugged in the hallway . 
  most rooms are empty . 
  few lights work . 
  this modest two-storey building in the frontier town of gevgelija is the crisis management centre at what is set to become the eu 's front line against the largest surge of migrants in more than half a century . 
  not everyone is optimistic about its prospects . 
  macedonia is a tiny state with an economy smaller than mali 's . 
  `` the idea this country is going to organise and sustain an operation of this scale , deal with the inevitable ugly consequences at the border and confront the people-smuggling bonanza this policy will produce is absurd , '' says gerald knaus , chairman of the european stability initiative , a think-tank . 
  `` the notion that you can use the weakest states in this region to build a wall against a schengen country is crazy , '' he adds , referring to greece 's membership of the eu 's passport-free travel zone . 
  but the idea of turning macedonia , a non-member of the eu , into a firewall against refugees travelling north from greece has gained support from brussels and berlin since it was initially promoted by central european countries such as hungary . 
  advocates of ringfencing greece say only a lockdown of the eu 's external borders can prevent a total collapse of schengen . 
  critics warn that sealing greece 's northern border will cause a humanitarian disaster and destabilise the volatile balkans region . 
  `` macedonia is a small country , burdened by a hard economic situation and serious interior political problems , '' oliver spasovski , interior minister , told the financial times . 
  a year-long political crisis has culminated in a caretaker administration taking office ahead of april elections , which the largest opposition party has threatened to boycott . 
  `` our capacity to successfully manage the existing refugee momentum has reached its peak , '' mr spasovski said . 
  since august , europe 's fourth-poorest country has been struggling with a daily inflow that has rarely fallen below 2,000 . 
  the government has now appealed to europe for financial aid and manpower . 
  in the meantime , the police are stretched . 
  although salaries are being increased , working conditions for macedonian police are poor , equipment is antiquated and overtime wages are rarely paid on time .
