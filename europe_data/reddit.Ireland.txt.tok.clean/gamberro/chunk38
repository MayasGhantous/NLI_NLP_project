  `` we are doing everything we can , but we are a country of 2m people and 1m people passed through our country in 2015 , '' said ivico bocevski , an adviser to the country 's president . 
  gevgelija was calm last week but , on occasion , police have resorted to stun grenades and tear gas to push back rejected asylum seekers from iran , pakistan and morocco . 
  field staff with m\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res say in the past two months they have treated 70 migrants for injuries sustained in so-called border pushbacks . 
  eu officials return to skopje this week for further talks on financial aid and the possibility of deploying hundreds of european police at the greek frontier . 
  but some analysts warn a border lockdown would only divert migrants through albania and revive old smuggling networks in a region long-plagued by the illicit transport of petrol , guns and people . 
  macedonian forces prevented 1,219 irregular border crossings in january alone yet people smugglers openly ply their trade at nearby hotels in greece . 
  the charge to shuttle rejected migrants across the border at night is about $ 500 -- more than a macedonian police officer 's monthly wage . 
  on thursday , officials shut the border for several hours for the second time in a week , citing temporary closures by macedonia 's northern neighbours . 
  hundreds of people were left out in the cold overnight in greece . 
  anxious officials in skopje are increasingly worried by such restrictions . 
  one notes that border closures by countries such as serbia and croatia are becoming `` more frequent and longer lasting , '' adding : `` i worry this will soon become permanent . '' if such fears become reality , gevgelija will find itself on the frontline of a much bigger refugee challenge . 
  what is your german friend telling you about the migrant camps out of curiosity ? 
  meh , as a geographic or linguistic term it seems perfectly acceptable to me . 
  the inquisition and other atrocities were based on the bible , particularly the old testament . 
  there 's plenty of fundamentalism there if you look for it ( leviticus 24:16 is an example ) . 
  however , it 's pretty fair to say that most fundamentalist christians have long since moved away from that kind of thinking . 
  christianity burned heretics/infidels for , among other things , reading the bible in their own language ( as opposed to latin ) . 
  however , fundamentalist christianity moved away from such violence centuries ago . 
  i think it is pretty clear in the 21st century that fundamentalist islam has not and remains incredibly violent . 
  out of curiosity , what editorials are you referring to ? 
  you 're more or loss correct in that our ties are strong and that governments from both our countries will try hard to keep it that way in the case of a brexit . 
  i also think that it 'd be the case regardless of what government is in power here ( we have elections coming up ) . 
  ** catalonia seeks foreign support for breakaway from spain ** * tobias buck in barcelona * the new catalan government will press ahead with its plan to form a breakaway state from spain over the next 18 months , and is looking to foreign governments , the eu and financial markets to raise the political pressure on madrid . 
  oriol junqueras , the regional finance minister and deputy president , told the financial times in an interview that his government had a mandate from the catalan people to push for secession . 
  but he also insisted that the campaign to create an independent catalan republic had implications far beyond the region and the spanish state -- and pointed in particular to the `` challenge '' posed by madrid 's towering public debt load . 
  `` we are convinced that this process is neither unilateral nor bilateral , '' mr junqueras said . 
  `` this is not just between the catalan republic and spain , or between the catalan republic , the eu and spain . 
  there are also many elements that have a private character . 
  the management of spain 's debt load is a challenge . 
  public debt is currently around $ 1,000 bn and economic growth continues to be funded by high public deficits . '' the minister argued that a deal to divide the debt between an independent catalonia and a separate spain would be better for the country 's creditors than leaving the debt to be paid by an `` untrustworthy '' government in madrid alone . 
  `` does it suit financial markets better to have just one interlocutor who until now has shown that he is neither very efficient nor trustworthy ? 
  or is it better to have another interlocutor , with the obvious determination to be both efficient and trustworthy ? 
  i think it is better to have an interlocutor who has that willingness . '' his remarks are likely to surprise spanish bondholders , who would typically regard a country break-up as a negative event -- and are currently buying spanish debt at record-low yields . 
  but they highlight a crucial facet of the catalan independence camp 's strategy , namely the attempt to `` internationalise '' their secession struggle by drawing in foreign actors , and steadily raising the political and economic cost for the spanish government . 
  `` who can put pressure on madrid ? 
  the supranational institutions can . 
  funds that own spanish debt can . 
  there are many actors who have a relevant opinion in this , '' mr junqueras said . 
  he acknowledged that spain had so far shown no sign of shifting its position on catalonia , which madrid insists has no right of self-determination under the spanish constitution . 
  but mr junqueras went on to highlight the country 's long history of territorial losses . 
  `` neither did they want the independence of argentina , nor of chile , nor mexico , nor the low countries , nor cuba . 
  this just shows that these processes do n't depend on the will of one of the two parties . '' after months of political drift and uncertainty in barcelona , catalan independence leaders say their campaign is making headway once again . 
  earlier this month , pro-secession parties managed to resolve their long-running differences , and agreed to form a new regional government , headed by carles puigdemont . 
  both he and mr junqueras have vowed to implement a secessionist `` road map '' , with the help of pro-independence lawmakers who hold a majority of seats in the regional parliament . 
  critics point out , however , that secessionist parties failed to win an outright majority of the vote at last year 's regional election -- and hence are going against the wishes of a majority of catalans . 
  several key elements of that plan fall under mr junqueras 's responsibility , including the task of setting up a separate catalan tax office and a new `` public bank '' that will act as `` an interlocutor with the european central bank '' , the minister said . 
  `` our objective is to be as prepared as possible [ for independence ] , and from there we will make use of whatever opportunities present themselves , '' he said . 
  mr junqueras said the government would stick to its plan even in the face of further adverse rulings by the spanish constitutional court , which last year found that the catalan road map violated various provisions of the country 's basic law . 
  `` we have to live up to our democratic mandate , '' he said . 
  `` it can not be that the legal framework prohibits the exercise of our democratic rights . '' mr junqueras 's most immediate challenge , however , will be to manage the public finances of a region that has amassed $ 68bn in debt , the highest of all spain 's regions , and that runs a 2.7 per cent budget deficit . 
  awkwardly for the new independence-minded government , catalonia is heavily dependent on liquidity support from madrid . 
  earlier this month , moody 's changed catalonia 's credit ratings outlook from stable to negative , in part out of concern that spanish liquidity support for the region could run dry if tensions escalate further . 
  mr junqueras acknowledged the precarious position , but insisted the region 's finances were in trouble only because madrid did not give back catalonia a fair share of the tax revenues raised in the region . 
  `` we will manage the resources that the spanish government give us in the best way possible . 
  and if we ca n't do more we will explain that this is because the spanish government arbitrarily decides not to give us the resources we need to fund basic social policies . '', 
  ** migrants fear their luck running out at macedonia 's border ** andrew byrne in gevgelija gevgelija is sometimes referred to as `` the macedonian las vegas '' for the casinos that have sprung up just across the border from northern greece . 
  but if eu leaders have their way , it may soon be known as the front line in their increasingly determined effort to staunch an inflow of migrants that totalled more than 1m last year and is unsettling politics as far away as sweden and denmark . 
  macedonia , not a member of the eu , confirmed on monday that it is holding talks with eu officials to work out the operational details of a joint deployment of police forces along its southern border with greece . 
  the plan is to seal off what has become a main corridor for migrants trying to reach germany , sweden and other , more prosperous parts of the continent . 
  already , some migrants are finding that what was once a main thoroughfare to europe is turning into a chokepoint . 
  `` i left on january 9 when i heard the way to europe was open , '' said hassan , a 27-year-old migrant from morocco , who has been trapped on the greek side of the border . 
  `` i had no idea we would face these kinds of problems . '' experts from frontex , the eu 's external border agency , visited skopje last week to examine conditions on the ground . 
  meanwhile , macedonia 's foreign minister said on monday that skopje would welcome eu support in securing its border against irregular migration , possibly including hundreds of european police officers . 
  `` there is no upper limit on the additional resources we would welcome , '' said nikola poposki , the foreign minister . 
  eighty police officers from eu member states are already working alongside macedonian police and military to patrol the country 's 228km border with greece but the government said it needs additional assistance to stem unpredictable migrant flows . 
  some of the migrants they are seeking to contain are just 7km south of gevgelija , where hundreds of people are massed at a makeshift camp on the flat plain of greece 's kilkis province . 
  their wood fires dot the fields surrounding an eko petrol station . 
  most have arrived by bus from athens to join a human backlog from the official border-crossing at the greek town of idomeni . 
  only syrians , afghans and iraqis who state their intention to seek asylum in austria or germany are allowed past the border controls into macedonia . 
  technically , macedonia can refuse entry to anyone not planning to claim asylum in the country -- a legal fact that jean-claude juncker , the european commission president , reiterated on monday . 
  at times , thousands of moroccans , iranians and pakistanis have been trapped in the idomeni camp , where more than 5,000 people have slept in heated tents designed to host 1,500 at most . 
  greek police have now begun busing rejected migrants back to camps in athens . 
  but some reappear days later in search of people smugglers offering passage to macedonia , according to aid workers . 
  others find their smuggler at nearby hotels just south of the macedonian border , frequently used as staging posts for late-night crossings . 
  any joint eu-macedonia operation to harden the border would face several legal and political challenges -- not least , greek anger . 
  frontex , the eu border agency , is not legally allowed to manage borders in non-eu countries -- although the commission is seeking to change this . 
  `` to base a full-scale frontex operation within a third country , as a kind of forward-line defence of eu borders , would be unprecedented , '' said leonhard den hertog , a migration researcher at the centre for european policy studies , a brussels think-tank . 
  but mr poposki expressed hope that a legal means could be found to deploy joint european forces at the frontier . 
  `` it does n't matter for us if it is frontex or bilateral -- the important thing is to have some assistance in managing the situation , '' he said . 
  skopje has already received razor wire fencing donated by hungary and night vision security cameras to detect irregular migrants . 
  but the country does not yet have access to the eu 's common database on asylum seekers , even though it has become a major transit country for the thousands of migrants arriving in europe each day . 
  some of those come from nadoor , hassan 's town in north-east morocco , which he says has seen 17,000 people leave for europe in the past four months alone . 
  two weeks ago , he flew to turkey , where he was granted a tourist visa , and then joined the trail of refugees -- first across the aegean sea and then overland through the western balkans . 
  with his chances of crossing into macedonia legally now in doubt , hassan is considering paying a smuggler $ 500 to deliver him over the border at nightfall -- but fears being robbed or beaten up by the traffickers . 
  `` now i do n't know what i will do , '' he said . 
  '' perhaps return to morocco . '',

  in case you get caught behind a paywall : ** belgian mayor seeks to ban male asylum seekers from pool ** * minister opposes idea which comes after iraqi man caught girl ( 11 ) coming off slide * a belgian mayor has proposed banning male refugees from a swimming pool for a month after complaints from female bathers . 
  the idea from marc vanden bussche , mayor of the coastal town of kokzijde , earned a swift rebuke from the country 's migration minister who said it would be ill-advised . 
  the proposal shows continuing tension over immigration in europe , which has heightened since authorities in neighbouring germany accused gangs of migrants of sexually assaulting women in cologne on new year 's eve . 
  `` we had women complain because they felt stared at and selfies had been taken with them . 
  it 's escalating . 
  we never had any complaints before , '' said mr vanden bussche said . 
  ** slide ** mr vanden bussche said he had decided to act after police were called in to investigate an iraqi man who had caught an 11-year-old girl as she came off a slide . 
  the politician from the dutch-speaking liberal party open vld , said he would propose a one-month ban at a council meeting on monday to allow tempers to cool . 
  the town recently took in 300 asylum seekers . 
  `` in the meantime we will teach them about our way of life and explain the rules of the pool to them , '' he said , adding the ban would not affect children and their mothers . 
  belgium 's state secretary for migration , theo francken , advised against the move . 
  `` it 's never wise to punish a whole group for the transgressions of a few , '' he said in a tweet . 
  `` asylum seekers live in open centres , they 're free to go swimming .
