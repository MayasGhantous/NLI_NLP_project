  votes on this in the parliament and it was pretty clear he was an unacceptable candidate for them . 
  that 's very sad that people would punish those who stuck to what was promised rather than those who break their promises after the vote is over . 
  this is a big deal everywhere , including here . 
  do n't you admire them sticking to what they said they 'd do during their election campaign ? 
  i 'd much prefer that than making promises that are then broken once the election is over . 
  let me give an example from my country at the last elections : the [ labour party put out adverts ] ( https://irishelectionliterature.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/fgeverylittlehelps.jpg ) warning of what might happen if another party won ( fine gael ) . 
  if the labour party did n't explicitly promise it made it clear that a vote for labour was a vote against these policies . 
  working class support helped labour win a lot of seats but the party went on to form a coalition with fine gael and implement the many measures it was supposedly against . 
  many people felt ( and still feel ) betrayed . 
  that looks magical !, 
  many thanks for sharing . 
  thank you for your explanation . 
  i actually think cup sticking to what it said and consulting it 's based was honourable . 
  i wish that was done in my country . 
  many thanks for your reply . 
  many thanks for your explanation . 
  do you live in catalonia if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  either way , i do n't see any good for the unionist cause in catalonia that will come of this . 
  the underlying issues have not been resolved ( at all ) and romeva/junqueras might easily replace mas to rally the cup behind them . 
  as a non-spaniard , can i ask what kind of outlet is vilaweb ? 
  what kind of orientation is it ( e.g. 
  pro/anti-independence , left/right ) ? 
  above all , why do you think it 's unreliable ? 
  came here to make sure somebody had done ireland and you did a very good job . 
  well done !, 
  i understand what you are saying about being careful but i would rather not label the entire community . 
  culture has a big part to play in this and i agree with you that this is not all caused by racism . 
  the immigrants from east asia ( for example ) come from cultures very different from our own and yet integrate/assimilate relatively well . 
  i hate to say it but there is a big problem with juvenile delinquency ( probably not a pc term but i do n't care ) among 2nd generation immigrants from the maghreb . 
  that 's the conclusion i 've come to after looking at the lawlessness , arson and vandalism in the french banlieues ( and elsewhere ) . 
  i 'm not sure what the solution is to this problem , but recognising that it exists is a first step . 
  for the record , i 'm not saying this is only a problem with people from the maghreb . 
  unfortunately , we have the same problem in ireland in really deprived neighbourhoods and where the people do n't come from an immigrant background ( although many of them are [ irish travellers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_travellers ) ) . 
  the estates have a bad reputation for car theft , arson , drug dealing , high unemployment and more . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jpm_pahblc ) a documentary about one . 
  merkel kicked the can down the road . 
  the underlying issues regarding sovereign debt and the eurozone not being a fiscal union remain unresolved . 
  ** far left tie leaves catalan president 's future hanging by thread ** * tobias buck in madrid * the political future of catalan president artur mas was hanging by a thread on monday , after a ballot at an extraordinary meeting of his prospective far-left allies produced a perfect tie -- with 1,515 delegates voting to back mr mas for another term and 1,515 voting against him . 
  if elected , mr mas has promised to preside over a single-issue government focused exclusively on leading catalonia to independence from spain . 
  but his party , the junts pel si movement , needs the support of the radical anti-capitalist popular unity candidacy ( cup ) to get him approved by the regional parliament in barcelona . 
  both parties support secession from spain , but are deeply divided on economic , social and diplomatic issues . 
  after three months of wrangling , a draft accord was finally on the table -- and put to a vote by the cup party base on sunday . 
  to the astonishment of observers and party leaders alike , the meeting produced an exact split . 
  cup leaders will meet again next saturday in an attempt to break the deadlock , further prolonging the political uncertainty hanging over the prosperous region -- and its president . 
  if there is no agreement to back mr mas , catalonia would have to hold elections in march . 
  it would be the third early election in the region in four years . 
  speaking on monday , mr mas tried to reassure voters that despite the current uncertainty , `` the country still functions and the government still functions '' . 
  junts pel si and the cup emerged from a regional ballot in september with a solid majority of seats in parliament -- a result they hailed at the time as a popular mandate to break with spain . 
  failure to convert this majority into a pro-independence government would be a severe blow to the secessionist movement -- suggesting that it is too divided to make genuine progress towards a new state . 
  `` it would be a big missed opportunity , '' said lluis orriols , a professor of political science at madrid 's carlos iii university prof orriols said , however , that an accord between junts pel si and the cup was still possible , and that the two groups might be able to put aside their ideological differences temporarily . 
  `` this legislature would be very short and very much focused on the one theme on which junts pel si and the cup are united -- independence , '' he said . 
  the political uncertainty in catalonia was mirrored on monday at national level , as efforts continued in madrid to overcome the political stalemate created by spain 's december 20 general election . 
  voters chose to make the centre-right popular party of prime minister mariano rajoy the biggest bloc in parliament once again -- but left it 53 seats short of an absolute majority on the 350-seat chamber . 
  mr rajoy has since pleaded for the support of the pp 's historic rival , the centre-left socialists , and of the centrist ciudadanos party , which entered parliament for the first time . 
  the socialists ( psoe ) , however , have made clear repeatedly they have no desire to throw in their lot with the pp and mr rajoy -- while ciudadanos has signalled they would at most contemplate abstaining in any vote to re-elect the prime minister . 
  pedro s\u00e1nchez , the leader of the psoe , reiterated his stance at a meeting of party leaders on monday , saying he would stick to his commitment to achieve a `` change towards the left '' in spain . 
  but mr s\u00e1nchez also appeared to rule out a pact with the anti-austerity podemos movement , citing its support for an independence referendum in catalonia . 
  `` we will not have a dialogue about the territorial integrity of spain , '' he said . 
  on monday , mr rajoy held meetings with the leaders of podemos and ciudadanos at the prime ministerial compound outside madrid . 
  neither appeared to bring the prime minister any closer to obtaining a majority in parliament , though a statement issued by his office afterwards made clear his position once again . 
  `` mariano rajoy expressed his conviction that the election results signal that according to the democratic mandate it should be he who leads the next spanish government , '' it said . 
  i 'm inclined to agree with you . 
  there are extremists in european universities nowadays ( like this guy ) but let 's not forget that this is not a new thing . 
  for many decades there have been students and staff in universities who think that mao , stalin and castro were the shit . 
  i think the point is that even after consulting its bases , the party does n't seem to be able to come to a decision as to how to proceed . 
  thanks . 
  sorry but what paedophile ring are you talking about ? 
  you 're all grand !, 
  congratulations to all the cypriots and merry christmas to all . 
  i mostly agree with you but i do n't see why states have n't withdrawn from schengen if it 's dead . 
  does russia really object to when soviet statues are taken down in poland ? 
  completely agree that madrid-barajas is very straightforward thanks to its layout . 
  if we ca n't deport them , we can enforce the law and put them in prison . 
  are n't the things these people are doing ( such as breaking locks , forcefully entering etc. ), 
  crimes in france ? 
  since they are desperate to get to the uk , sending them to prison in france would be the last thing they 'd want .

  not a spaniard but i agree that rajoy 's predecessors ( such as zapatero ) share some of the blame for the mess spain finds itself in . 
  but then again , violence is not the way to go and if we were to punch every member of the political class responsible for making this mess that europe as a whole finds itself in ( not just spain ) , we would be here for a long time . 
  what happens if they arrive and we ca n't read their fingerprints ? 
  it can happen to people who handle certain chemicals or who purposefully use them to remove their fingerprints . 
  you would n't have a link to those stories , would you ? 
  i 'd like to read more . 
  what do you mean ? 
  of course , but i found it refreshing to read the user above describing it as a `` developing human . '', 
  my ex was highly opinionated about abortion , describing the foetus as a `` parasite '' or `` no different from a tumour . '', 
  after hearing that , i find it refreshing to hear the opposing view . 
  even after 1978 there were strong restrictions . 
  pharmacies were the only ones that stocked them and you used to require a prescription from a doctor just to buy them . 
  it was only in 1992 that the restrictions on the sale of condoms were fully relaxed . 
  this is just a detail lad , but ireland was conquered ( and reconquered ) many times starting from the mid 16th century . 
  while mostly unsuccessful in replacing the irish people with english settlers , these attempts were successful at disempowering them . 
  i know what you are saying , but should we extend our freedoms to those who want to destroy them ? 
  or actively use them to destroy the societies that maintain them ? 
  i agree with you . 
  but if you do that amnesty international and these guys ' legal teams will argue that it violates their human rights . 
  no problem . 
  sorry the article was against the community guidelines . 
  i 'll be more careful in the future .
