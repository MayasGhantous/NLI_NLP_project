  ** turkey still sees kurdish nationalism as bigger threat than isis ** * david gardner in beirut * recent events highlight how shaky an ally ankara is for the coalition against caliphate turkey , a nato ally and eu candidate-member at the crossroads of europe and the middle east and with russia to its north , is at the centre stage of two dramas uppermost in european minds : the syrian refugee crisis and the menace of isis , which is defending its jihadi state by attacking its enemies abroad , from paris to beirut . 
  turkey is literally on the frontline , with jihadis using its territory to go into syria and refugees using turkey to flee to the eu . 
  isis has carried out three suicide bombings in turkey since the summer . 
  although formally part of the us-led coalition to fight isis in iraq and syria , turkey 's participation comes up short . 
  the eu , overlooking the way in which president recep tayyip erdogan 's authoritarianism has trampled on the rule of law and freedom of expression , has just cut a deal in which turkey , already host to 2.2 m syrian refugees , will act as a holding pen for the migration exodus still to come . 
  dramatic events in the past week highlight how wobbly an ally turkey is . 
  first , the turkish air force shot down a russian warplane that violated its air space . 
  second , can dundar , editor of cumhuriyet , one of less than a handful of independent newspapers extant in turkey , and its ankara bureau chief erdem gul , were imprisoned on espionage charges . 
  third , tahir elci , a leading human rights lawyer in the mainly kurdish south-east of turkey , was shot dead . 
  each incident is a reminder of turkey 's reluctance to take on isis , and instead fight kurdish nationalism on both sides of its border with syria . 
  beyond rounding up isis suspects who had until relatively recently moved inside turkey with some ease , the government has taken no direct action to respond to october 's isis bombing in ankara , which killed 102 pro-kurdish activists protesting against the resumption of fighting in the south-east between security forces and kurdish insurgents . 
  the trespassing in turkish air space of russian jets -- in syria since september to repel rebel advances against the regime of bashar al-assad -- was , by contrast , considered an intolerable breach of sovereignty . 
  the jailing of the cumhuriyet journalists , for publishing evidence of arms deliveries to syrian islamist fighters by turkey 's national intelligence agency ( mit ) , is one of many instances of mr erdogan 's tendency to shoot the messenger . 
  prosecutors and policemen investigating the case have been in jail for more than a year , joined last weekend by two generals and a colonel . 
  speaking to teachers last week , the president said : `` so what if the mit trucks were filled with weapons ? '' mr elci was killed at a press conference calling for an end to fighting between turks and kurds , after a gun battle broke out . 
  but even the government says it may have been an assassination -- amid continuing attacks on kurdish political targets . 
  the us is showing signs of exasperation with ankara 's failure to seal the border with syria and to act against isis , president vladimir putin says mr erdogan and turkey are `` accomplices of terrorists '' , and a senior eu official says turkey was `` a spoiler '' at last month 's diplomatic summit in vienna to chart a transition out of syria 's civil war . 
  but , the eu official says , turkey has no more room to play what he called `` double games '' . 
  the `` migration action package '' , aside from giving ankara $ 3bn to help manage the refugee influx , will supposedly reopen stalled eu accession talks on the rule of law and fundamental freedoms , exposing turkey to intrusive scrutiny . 
  after the vienna summit , which iran attended for the first time , the eu official says : `` if turkey continues playing double games that will play very badly . '' yet there is little to suggest any shift in turkey 's judgment that syrian kurdish advances along its southern border , as fighting reignites with kurdish insurgents in south-east turkey , are a greater threat than isis , or that mr erdogan regards the rediscovered relationship with the eu as anything more than transactional . 
  `` erdogan has shown he is not willing to share power with anyone '' , says one prominent turkish analyst , `` much less the eu '' . 
  is anybody else concerned that these people were free to wander across europe ? 
  s\u00e1nchez gordillo comes across as an idiot . 
  i remember reading in el pa\u00eds that the soup kitchens/ngos were not short of food when this happened . 
  wow , you 're right . 
  just add the words globalism or islamisation to the above and you have the front national . 
  many thanks . 
  i am reading both your posts now . 
  why do they bother if they ca n't get approved ? 
  also are you sending them back ? 
  i do n't think western leaders were pulling the strings . 
  i think they just saw somebody they could do business with , be it on the economic or military fronts . 
  [ tusk admitted in october at the epp conference in madrid that europe had lost control of its borders .

  you 're welcome . 
  i do n't know where in belgium you are from but i know there are sizeable communities of jews in antwerp and brussels . 
  you might be interested in seeing how the haskalah played out in your country . 
   after all , groups like boko haram did n't form out of western intervention . 
  instead , they ( their name literally means ` western education is forbidden ' ) is a reaction to what they view as the spreading of incompatible western beliefs . 
  i had n't thought about it that way . 
  thank you . 
  is receiving cash/payment not part of a transaction ? 
  is reaching an agreement as to the terms ( as sickening as that sounds ) not part of a transaction ? 
  from watching the video it appeared to show both of those things . 
  i will also add that i am ignorant of the situation along the turkish border and do n't speak german to understand the report properly . 
   instead , this is more like treatment for cancer . 
  we do n't have a cure yet , but that does n't mean you do n't try fighting it from growing what do you recommend ? 
  i do n't know a lot about jewish history but the [ haskalah ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haskalah ) was pretty important in creating a secular jewish culture and various denominations of judaism ( reform etc. ), 
  as you have probably seen by now in this thread , some irish people have very negative views on the language . 
  however , i think there is a big difference between the basque country and ireland with regards identity and language ( with it being much more strongly associated in the basque country than here ) . 
  with all due respect to mr. benn and his words around the 13 minute mark , the problem extends beyond daesh and has to do with the ideology . 
  it is the * ideology * that holds all of those mps in contempt , the people they represent in contempt and democracy itself in contempt . 
  we are all kafir/infidels in its eyes and thus held in huge contempt . 
  the fact is that this ideology has been fuelled by saudi arabia and the gulf states for some time now , did not start with daesh and sadly will not end with it . 
  until we are willing to confront those fuelling the ideology , we will at best be fighting with one hand tied behind our backs . 
  that 's a very powerful speech . 
  watching it makes me wonder if corbyn goes belly up , would he be a potential labour leader ? 
  ** edit ** on another note , does anybody have a breakdown of the vote by mp ? 
  i do n't know what you are getting at ( my fault ) . 
  my point was that europe has huge socio-economic problems as it is and was struggling to take care of the poor before this crisis started . 
  i agree with you . 
  but europe is no more poorer if languages such as breton or occitan are lost either . 
  we ought to copy what you guys have done with euskera by making more schools where subjects are taught through irish as well as introducing bilingual schools ( subjects are taught through both languages ) . 
  [ according to wikipedia , ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/euskera_en_el_sistema_educativo#pa.c3.ads_vasco ) about 70 percent of pupils are taught through basque in the basque country at primary level , with a further 25 percent being taught through bilingual schools . 
  in ireland the figure for primary level is about 6 percent . 
  many of these migrants seem to believe very unrealistic things about europe . 
  [ to quote one syrian migrant in spain  ( http://www.dw.com/en/syrian-refugees-stuck-in-spanish-guantanamo/a-18840654 )  `` in europe there is n't any war , '' he told dw . 
  `` if you come to europe , there is food , a place to sleep and there are n't any problems . '', 
  southern europe was already experiencing a socio-economic crisis before this migrant one started . 
  in greece it had/has already become a [ humanitarian crisis ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-07-17/greece-now-full-blown-humanitarian-crisis-9-charts ) of pretty startling proportions .

  ** abdelhamid abaaoud : from thief to jihadi linkman in two years ** * sam jones , defence and security editor * intelligence fails to keep pace with militants ' swift transformations the transformation of abdelhamid abaaoud -- the isis figure at the centre of the paris attacks -- from suburban thief to mass murderer in only two years , epitomises the new face of jihadi terror . 
  abaaoud , who was killed by french police on wednesday afternoon , has been a marked man for months . 
  but in the wake of the massacre in the french capital on friday , perpetrated by isis gunmen and bombers under his guidance , tracking down the 27-year-old became the top priority of every counter-terrorism agency in europe . 
  on monday , in a dramatic twist to the largest counterterror operation ever mounted in europe , french intelligence determined that abaaoud was under their noses , and was already working with another cell in paris to launch an imminent attack on charles de gaulle airport . 
  in the early hours of wednesday , more than 110 police stormed the building occupied by the jihadi , prompting a seven-hour siege in which 5,000 rounds were fired before abaaoud was eventually killed . 
  it took 24 hours for forensic scientists to identify his remains . 
  abaaoud was more puppet master than mastermind -- a distinction that has worrying implications for counter-terrorism work . 
  his rapid radicalisation , his youth , his digital savvy , his connections and his viciousness represent everything that intelligence agencies worry about when it comes to isis 's reach and powers . 
  louis caprioli , a former french intelligence counter-terrorism chief and expert on islamist networks , points out that until last year , abaaoud appeared to be a minor figure . 
  but his links to at least three other attacks , including the attempt to gun down passengers on a thalys intercity train in august and the aborted raids on two churches in the french town of villejuif in april , show that his influence had rapidly grown . 
  `` it seems that abaaoud has had contacts with each of those who tried the attacks , '' mr caprioli said . 
  `` is he simply a go-between ? 
  we do n't know . '' according to two european intelligence officials with knowledge of intelligence about the jihadi , he had become one of a number of key , charismatic `` linkmen '' between isis 's operations in syria and its pool of would-be recruits and returnee fighters in europe . 
  but he appears to have been far more than a messenger . 
  he is referred to by security officials in the same breath as mohammed emwazi , reyaad khan and junaid hussain , who also had a kind of celebrity status in the isis command structure that allowed them to gain respect and foster bonds with other like-minded fighters from similar backgrounds , both directly and via social media . 
  for abaaoud , the turning point came with a grandstanding interview he gave in dabiq , isis 's glossy propaganda sheet , in february . 
  it positioned him as one of a number of charismatic young men isis 's central leadership in raqqa had at its disposal , with whom it could connect to networks in europe . 
  as a result , he was designated a key target by the anti-isis coalition . 
  his plotting , said one senior french official , was one of the reasons why president fran\u00e7ois hollande began air strikes in syria last month . 
  abaaoud 's swift transformation to jihadi figurehead illustrates how isis has completely changed the way intelligence agencies need to address the islamist terror threat , according to one senior british security official . 
  `` the flash-to-bang is now so much quicker , '' he said , referring to the period between a threat emerging and then crystallising into a concrete attack . 
  it took al-qaeda more than a decade to build upon the foreign fighter networks that grew out of the last big jihadi conflict in afghanistan in the 1980s , the official noted . 
  `` isis is doing it in months . '' security experts say that figures such as abaaoud are the counterpoint to al-qaeda 's khalid sheikh mohammed , an operational veteran and strategic mastermind , in the new order of global jihad . 
  `` khalid sheikh mohammed was a very skilful plotter : a manipulator with huge ambition , ability and determination , '' said richard barrett , former head of counter-terrorism operations at the british intelligence agency mi6 and now consultant at the soufan group . 
  `` abaaoud is something quite different . 
  he 's motivated , and is able to motivate people like him , by isis 's vision . 
  radicalisation is n't quite the word for it .
