  he 's offering people a new life -- a track somewhere -- a life that can either be in the caliphate or in paradise . '' the allure of that vision is a powerful one , as the figures show . 
  at least 1,500 french and more than 500 belgian citizens have gone to fight for isis . 
  this suggests that the availability of other attractive figureheads for isis to call upon in its renewed efforts to perpetrate terror against its enemies is going to grow . 
  `` this is the future , '' mr barrett said . 
  `` there are many other abdelhamid abaaouds . '', 
   turkey had kept that border crossing open while isis was in control on the southern side , but immediately closed it when the ypg seized the crossing point . 
  dear god . 
   [ ... ] since they are in favour of stuff that would make actual far right parties lose their shit . 
  what stuff are you referring to ? 
  what was controversial about the law against gender violence if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  ** refugee influx threatens fall of eu , warns dutch pm ** * peter spiegel in the hague * the eu risks suffering the same fate as the roman empire if it does not regain control of its borders and stop the `` massive influx '' of refugees from the middle east and central asia , the dutch prime minister has warned . 
  mark rutte , whose government assumes the eu 's rotating presidency in january , said southern eu countries had yet to implement policies agreed to stem the flow , which has exceeded 850,000 arriving by sea so far this year , according to the international organisation for migration . 
  mr rutte said greece , where more than 700,000 have landed this year , might have to increase its `` reception capacity '' to at least 100,000 . 
  athens has so far committed to about half that , insisting that it does not want to become a giant refugee camp . 
  hundreds of thousands of refugees have travelled on from greece and italy to other eu countries -- principally to germany and sweden -- creating huge administrative and political strains across the union . 
  `` as we all know from the roman empire , big empires go down if the borders are not well-protected , '' said mr rutte in an interview with a group of international newspapers . 
  `` so we really have an imperative that it is handled . '' his comments echoed a warning by jean-claude juncker , president of the european commission , that a breakdown of the eu 's 26-country open-border system , known as schengen , would put the whole union in peril . 
  `` we have to safeguard the spirit behind schengen , '' mr juncker told the european parliament on wednesday . 
  `` yes , the schengen system is partly comatose . 
  but . 
  a single currency does not exist if schengen fails . 
  it is one of the pillars of the construction of europe . '' mr rutte said the eu needed to act quickly to stem the migrant flow , adding that he was optimistic that sunday 's summit in brussels between president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey and eu leaders would help ease conditions by providing $ 3bn to improve refugee camps in turkey and disrupting the `` business model '' of human smugglers channelling migrants in boats to greece . 
  `` it 's not the case that you will close a deal and then , on monday , everything is delivered , '' he said . 
  `` it 's not like you buy a house . 
  but i think , on both sides , we need confidence building . '' mr rutte was careful not to label the migrant crisis a security threat , in the wake of the november 13 terrorist attacks in paris . 
  the issue of whether the influx of migrants poses a security threat has quickly gone from the extreme fringes of the eu 's political debate to the mainstream , with elected leaders in hungary , poland and germany all voicing concerns in the days following the paris attacks . 
  french investigators have said at least two of the attackers entered europe through migrant reception facilities in greece . 
  mr rutte acknowledged the threat posed by `` foreign fighters '' -- european nationals who have joined militants in iraq and syria -- had risen , saying those returning from the war zone were now more lethal because they `` really have been taught the most evil techniques '' by extremist groups . 
  most of the paris attackers are believed to have been french or belgian nationals . 
  he chided far-right populist parties linking migration and terrorism , saying they were attempting to make `` one big soup of all this '' . 
  he insisted governments were able to weed out potential threats during the screening of asylum seekers in their initial processing . 
  `` there 's no reason to think all the refugees are now potential terrorists , '' said mr rutte . 
  `` yes , there is a risk that a terrorist might be among the refugees , and we have to do everything we can to make sure we very clearly single out that particular person . '' the great majority of people coming to europe were refugees . 
  he also refused to criticise belgium , which has come under intense scrutiny from french authorities amid mounting evidence that brussels served as the planning centre for the paris attacks . 
  mr rutte said charles michel , the belgian prime minister , had responded responsibly to the threat , adding that any eu country could face a similar risk . 
  `` yes , we should be very vigilant , but at the same time we should continue our way of life , '' he said . 
  `` we have more people than they do . 
  we have the older civilisation . 
  we should not let ourselves be scared . '', 
  i do n't think it is something that these people could claim lightheartedly . 
  for one thing these people would risk being ostracised ( at least ) from the muslim community in europe , if not worse . 
  in case you get caught behind a paywall : ** france will live under terror threat for ` several years ' , pm says ** * anne-sylvaine chassany in paris * the risk of terror attacks will hang over france for `` several years '' manuel valls , french prime minister , warned on tuesday as he vowed to use the extensive powers granted by a state of emergency to clamp down on jihadi networks in the country . 
  `` we have forgotten that history is fundamentally tragic , '' mr valls told a group of foreign newspapers . 
  `` the french have to prepare for this threat , to bear in mind that there will probably be more attacks . '' the comments add to the sense of emergency at the highest level of the french state since suicide bombers and gunmen killed 130 in paris and saint denis 10 days ago . 
  they also serve as an acknowledgment by the government of its limits in protecting the public from terrorists determined to cause maximum and indiscriminate damage . 
  mr valls , who became french premier last year after being interior minister for two years , has adopted the bellicose rhetoric used by president fran\u00e7ois hollande in the aftermath of the attacks . 
  the 53-year-old prime minister pledged to `` annihilate '' isis , the militant islamist group that has claimed responsibility for the assaults . 
  `` it 's a war , not a conventional one but a war , '' mr valls said on tuesday . 
  `` i know some countries have refused to use that term to avoid giving terrorists the pleasure , but we have to say things as they are . '' the september 11 2001 attacks on the us were a turning point , he added . 
  on friday , november 13 , mr valls was in his wife 's home in the 11th arrondissement of paris -- not far from the scenes of the attacks -- when he received a text message from bernard cazeneuve , interior minister , alerting him to explosions near the stade de france . 
  a few minutes later , he received a call from a journalist living above la belle equipe , one of the bars attacked by the gunmen . 
  `` i told myself : that 's it . 
  that 's the terror attack i feared , '' mr valls recounted . 
  he later learned that the son of a friend was among the 19 victims shot dead at the bar . 
  since january , when three french-born islamists assaulted the satirical magazine charlie hebdo , police officers and a jewish supermarket -- killing 17 -- `` we have managed to avert several attacks '' , mr valls insisted . 
  `` i have warned that we could suffer a more violent attack . '' in the spring , he had his staff prepare a document detailing the appropriate response to such an attack . 
  one of the options he recommended was to declare a state of the emergency , a constitutional clause that allows police to conduct house searches without warrants , among other enhanced powers . 
  the measure , which has been extended until february , has so far allowed french authorities to conduct 1,233 house searches , detain 165 people and round up 230 weapons . 
  police can now place under house arrest individuals who show suspicious behaviour or make suspicious comments . 
  on tuesday , they were leading an `` important '' operation in artigat , a village in the south-west , where olivier corel , a 69-year-old islamist , resides , according to mr valls . 
  the so-called `` white emir '' is known to be related to fabien clain , another french jihadi , whose voice was detected on an isis video claiming responsibility for the paris attacks . 
  mr corel is seen as a spiritual guide to known terrorists , including mohammed merah , who shot jewish children in toulouse in 2012 , and amedy coulibaly , one of the three terrorists who struck paris in january . 
  `` the state of emergency is not a deprivation of liberty , '' mr valls insisted . 
  the french premier rebuffed suggestions the security services had failed after it emerged there were indications in august that abdelhamid abaaoud , the alleged organiser of the paris assaults , had instructed a french returnee from syria to attack a music venue . 
  `` there are specific threats against people . 
  we 're taking them very seriously . 
  people are under protection , notably in the jewish community , '' he said . 
  there was no specific threat against the bataclan , the theatre where three terrorists blew themselves up after shooting people in the audience , mr valls said . 
  `` protecting those places is very difficult anyway . 
  the real subject is [ to identify a plot ] ahead of time , through intelligence work , '' he argued . 
  the fact that abaaoud had returned from syria to france to supervise the attacks may have resulted from the failure of several terrorist operations , such as one on a thalys train in august , mr valls said . 
  with less than two weeks to go before regional elections , the spanish-born prime minister expressed concerns that the national front , the anti-immigration party headed by marine le pen , might benefit from the latest attacks . 
  he urged european countries to act together to protect its borders , reiterating that the bloc could not welcome any more migrants . 
  `` the extreme right can be strengthened , '' mr valls said . 
  `` let 's say that i see no reason for [ the influence of ] the national front to decrease . '', 
  this may surprise you but [ a third of schools in ireland are gender segregated , ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/gender-imbalances-in-the-classroom-and-all-the-way-up-1.2067438 ) being primarily run by the catholic church ( the catholic church is the patron of about 90 percent of primary schools here ) . 
  ** edit ** corrected figures . 
  i hate to be pedantic but i would say the french model is based on assimilation rather than integration . 
  back to your point , as i come from a country where religion is very much in school and people of different faiths are kept apart , i prefer the french model . 
  a lot of tension both north and south of the border could be avoided if people of different faiths were educated together . 
  what is frustrating for me is that they travel all the way to countries like mine supposedly because they ca n't get jobs back home and once they are here they do n't work . 
  i understand they suffer discrimination in their countries of origin and the roma people have a traumatic past ( nazi attempts at extermination plus enslavement ) . 
  ** but ** too many are not interested in taking the second chance they get once they are here . 
  instead too many seem more interested in living off the altruism of people . 
  well do you understand how bizarre it is to equate the two ? 
  the cultural impacts of immigration from poland are minor compared to those of pakistan . 
  the current wave of poles in the uk will almost certainly assimilate into british society like previous waves before it ( eg . 
  during and after wwii ) . 
  unfortunately , that ca n't be said of the waves from pakistan . 
  i would replace polish with romanian and bulgarian . 
  they seem to be the nationalities most singled out by farage . 
   it is n't my reason , but inside the eu the uk can not control who comes to the uk as well as it can when we leave . 
  this is important . 
  the uk ca n't control free movement of eu citizens into the uk but it can control immigration from other parts of the world . 
  personally i think migrants from the rest of the eu are the least of your worries . 
  i 've said it before and i 'll say it again : what is going to happen in 2016 when further hundreds of thousands come ? 
  the numbers of people coming from war torn countries ( in addition to the economic migrants ) has shown no sign of letting up and put our resources under immense strain . 
  ** german jewish leader josef schuster calls for refugee quotas ** * stefan wagstyl in berlin * the leader of germany 's jewish community has backed calls for refugee quotas , warning that many asylum seekers are from cultures marked by `` hate towards jews and intolerance '' . 
  josef schuster 's comments come amid a widening split over the issue between chancellor angela merkel and the bavaria-based csu , sister party to her cdu . 
  ms merkel has generally resisted such restrictions but is under increasing pressure from her bavarian allies to toughen her stance .
