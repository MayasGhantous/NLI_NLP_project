  even though germany 's jewish community is small , its views tend to carry disproportionate weight because of the country 's responsibility for the holocaust . 
  `` sooner or later we will not be able to avoid [ setting ] upper limits , '' dr schuster , president of the central council of jews in germany , told welt newspaper . 
  `` many refugees are fleeing the terror of the islamic state and want to live in peace and freedom , but at the same time they come from cultures in which hate towards jews and intolerance are fixed components . 
  do n't only think about the jews , think about equal rights for women and the treatment of homosexuals . '' if the inflows continued at the current rates it would become `` increasingly difficult '' to integrate migrants and `` pass on our values '' . 
  dr schuster was speaking after ms merkel clashed with horst seehofer , the csu leader , at the party 's annual conference in munich on friday . 
  addressing the 1,000 or so delegates , ms merkel firmly rejected quotas and watched stony-faced as mr seehofer joined her on the podium and pledged to fight for such limits . 
  ms merkel 's cdu allies later condemned mr seehofer for trying to humiliate the chancellor by making her look like `` a schoolgirl being handed her report '' . 
  senior politicians in both parties also tried to narrow their differences by pointing out that ms merkel also backed quotas -- albeit at the eu level -- with her plans for the eu as a whole to take fixed numbers directly from turkey . 
  however , ms merkel still faces formidable challenges with csu and rightwing cdu mps calling for further national restrictions , notably on rights to bring in family members . 
  the chancellor appears reluctant to back such restrictions and the centre-left spd , the third coalition partner , is opposed . 
  dr schuster , 61 , was born in israel to german jewish refugees . 
  unusually , the family returned to germany and settled in 1956 in its home region of northern bavaria . 
  germany 's jewish community -- once composed mainly of the descendants of pre-1939 german jews -- has swelled from 30,000 in 1990 to about 250,000 largely due to immigration from the former soviet bloc . 
  his call for quotas follows warnings about the risk posed by some muslim refugees for german jews . 
  dr schuster and other jewish leaders voiced their concerns at a meeting with ms merkel last month . 
  after years of decline , the number of anti-semitic crimes in germany rose last year by 25 per cent to 1,596 , according to the interior ministry . 
  however , the figures showed that most were linked to german rightwingers and not to so-called `` foreign ideology '' . 
  germany recorded more anti-semitic attacks than any other eu state , including france and the uk , which have larger jewish communities . 
  however , analysts caution that the figures may not be comparable as recording standards vary and germany is scrupulous in its record-keeping . 
  ** italy plans bad bank-style debt clean-up to aid recovery ** * rachel sanderson in milan and james politi in rome * italy plans to launch a series of bad bank-style measures as early as the end of the year in an effort to cut its $ 330bn pile of non-performing loans as it seeks a `` silver bullet '' to boost its weak economic recovery , say senior officials . 
  such a move raises the prospect of a confrontation with the european commission , which has so far rejected draft plans presented by the italian treasury , arguing that any government intervention would qualify as state aid , the officials say . 
  according to several senior italian officials , one plan under discussion involves placing the bulk of italy 's npls into a privately held vehicle in which senior debt would be guaranteed by the state , probably through the state development agency cassa depositi e prestiti . 
  the aim would be to reduce the gap between the price banks are offering to sell the loans and the price private entities are willing to pay for them , which has remained stubbornly wide , amid private investors ' concerns about the ease of clawing back soured loans in italy . 
  one senior government official said a clean-up of npls would be the single most effective `` silver bullet '' for boosting italian growth . 
  `` the aim is to create a structure with as little involvement of the state as possible '' in order to avoid triggering european commission rules on state aid , said another senior italian official , speaking on condition of anonymity . 
  nonetheless , bank executives remain sceptical . 
  `` it would be a miracle if they manage to convince the eu , '' said the chief executive of one of italy 's largest banks . 
  the move comes as the government of matteo renzi , prime minister , takes increasingly aggressive steps to shore up weakness in italy 's banking sector , unresolved since the eurozone debt crisis , which has remained a drag on lending to the real economy . 
  the cabinet was meeting on sunday for an emergency session , while the markets were closed , to decide measures to inject $ 2bn to save four small banks -- banca marche , cariferrara , carichieti and banca etruria -- taken under state control in the past year due to lack of solvency . 
  again , italy 's plans to rescue the lenders , using funds from a national fund paid for by italy 's banks , have faced opposition from brussels on the grounds that this would be state aid , according to several people . 
  italy 's stock of npls hit $ 330bn in mid-2014 , according to the international monetary fund . 
  the sum has barely slipped from that level -- with a knock-on effect on bank lending . 
  credit flow to small businesses that make up the bulk of the italian economy remains stagnant , according to data from the bank of italy . 
  the government sees encouraging businesses to ramp up investment in the real economy as crucial to galvanising growth . 
  most recent data show italy 's economy grew a disappointing 0.2 per cent in the third quarter of this year . 
  echoing growing concern among italy 's business leaders , citi analyst giada giani wrote this week that while the country 's reform momentum had picked up over the past two years , the impact on current growth was probably limited , as signs of improvement to overall competitiveness were scant . 
  `` once the monetary and fiscal stimuli fade , we reckon italian gdp growth is unlikely to exceed the 0.75 per cent to 1 per cent range , '' she wrote . 
  i think we are talking at cross purposes . 
  i do n't deny that we are rolling out the red carpet for saudi arabia ( the very country that is exporting wahabbism ) . 
  my point was directed towards western military interventions in the middle east ( e.g. 
  iraq and afghanistan ) . 
  the intolerance towards say conversions from islam , depictions of muhammad and women 's dress have little or anything to do with that . 
  rather it 's a result of growing intolerance in part of the muslim community , with the firm backing of saudi arabia . 
  that 's my point . 
  i am sorry if this is off topic but i am tired of hearing western foreign policy being brought up as an excuse for islamism in europe ( and i have heard this too often from the left ) . 
  believing sharia law should be implemented in europe , that leaving islam is punishable by death and much more has nothing to do with western foreign policy in the middle east/africa . 
  i would argue that it had a sectarian element to it as its support ( largely ) came from one particular community and its members carried out sectarian attacks from time to time . 
  however , to answer the point made by / u/ajaume _ 2 , during the troubles , the sdlp was the most voted party in the catholic community and it condemned violence ( proposing only constitutional means ) . 
  i apologize if it is an unreliable news source . 
  i was not familiar with it but will be more careful in sharing articles from it in the future . 
  i 'd be interested in seeing a survey of the attitudes of muslims in europe to these questions . 
  thanks lad !, 
  i was looking for a documentary on this topic . 
  most irish people consider the start of english ( then later british ) rule as the anglo-norman invasion of 1169 and refer to `` seven hundred years '' until independence in the 20th century . 
  control may be difficult to determine as there were many re-conquests and plantations afterwards , but i think it clearly lasted at least half a millenia . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  a quick google search revealed nothing . 
  upvoted for the guns n ' roses reference !, 
   of course they do n't have a right to vote - they are not israeli citizens , and by their own choice !, 
  please elaborate as to how that is by their own choice ? 
  as far as i am aware only the residents of east jerusalem have that choice . 
   they are palestinians citizens and have a palestinian authority passport . 
  why in fuck 's name would they be allowed to influence the elections of another country ? 
  can israelis vote for the p.a elections ? 
  i 've seen this argument before and it is not comparable . 
  palestine is not a sovereign state and therefore does not have the same level of sovereignty as israel as you are well aware . 
  the israeli government has worked very hard to ensure that that remains the case ( with netanyahu even promising that during the last election ) . 
  there is currently only one sovereign state there , one which maintains the occupation , continues annex territory as it sees fit and construct settlements in defiance of international law . 
   really shows you have a poor grasp of the war history of israel . 
  to attempt to paint israel as an aggressor to its arab neighbors is laughable . 
  oh believe me , i have read zionist accounts of israel 's history and i was very pro-israel for many years . 
  i do not deny that israel has been attacked in the past , but i also do n't accept israel 's narrative that its actions were those of self-defence . 
  finally , and perhaps most importantly , are n't we getting away from the point about whether we should listen to israel on counter terrorism ? 
  ** paris attacks renew questions about europe 's border-free travel ** * peter spiegel in brussels * even before the paris terror attacks , europe 's schengen system of border-free travel -- one of the continent 's proudest postwar achievements -- was under strain . 
  the mass influx of migrants from africa and the middle east has prompted governments from sweden to austria to reimpose emergency border controls and erect fences in recent months . 
  but friday night 's attacks are now raising the possibility that the ease of movement that schengen guarantees may have been used by the terrorists to wreak havoc . 
  french authorities working to identify the suicide bombers who blew themselves up outside the stade de france have matched a fingerprint of one of the attackers to a man who entered the eu on the greek island of leros in october . 
  a passport found near his body bore the name of ahmad al mohammad , and said he was a 25-year-old syrian from the north-west town of idlib , an area outside the control of islamic state extremists near the turkish border . 
  the suggestion that someone who entered the eu along with thousands of other refugees washing ashore on greece 's easternmost islands was able to move unhindered across national boundaries before assaulting the french capital has intensified the debate over whether schengen can survive in its present form . 
  viktor orban , the hungarian prime minister who has been the bloc 's leading elected critic of its handling of the migration influx , said european leaders had ignored the threat of terrorism and that violent extremists were using the refugee influx to `` blend in '' with migrants arriving on the continent . 
  `` european and american security experts , spy chiefs and law enforcement officials repeatedly warned europe of the increased risk of terrorism . 
  every politician and every european leader had knowledge of these risks , '' he told hungarian legislators on monday . 
  `` it 's alarming to consider how many terrorists have crossed through our lands . 
  it 's time to put an end to this . '' security experts describe schengen as a gaping loophole as they struggle to monitor some of the estimated 3,000 european citizens who have gone to fight in syria and iraq and may return to stage attacks like the one that has devastated paris . 
  the european commission has been careful to argue that the series of new border checks imposed by eu state -- along with the weekend decision by france to tighten entry restrictions within hours of the attack -- are in line with the existing schengen treaty . 
  `` the schengen agreement explicitly allows for the reintroduction of border checks within the eu , particularly in emergency situations which include terrorist attacks , '' said natasha bertaud , the commission spokeswoman on migration issues . 
  `` we feel the rules we have at the moment do allow us to deal with the situation . '' indeed , the quick reintroduction of controls by france nearly netted the country 's most-wanted man : alleged conspirator abdeslam salah , whose car was pulled over by french police on the a2 motorway to belgium within hours of the attack . 
  because his involvement was not known at the time , he was ultimately released and is now the subject of an international manhunt . 
  eu officials said they have weighed a more sweeping response , including a provision in the schengen agreement that allows brussels to recommend temporary , europe-wide controls if ad hoc national decisions threaten to undermine the system . 
  but that option was ultimately deemed impractical . 
  instead , when eu interior ministers meet for an emergency session on friday , they are due to discuss schengen 's external borders instead , particularly ways to better identify security threats as they cross into the region . 
  in announcing the friday session , bernard cazeneuve , the french interior minister , said he was seeking a `` targeted revision '' of schengen so that threats are better shared with those responsible for monitoring `` the external borders of the eu '' -- something repeated by president fran\u00e7ois hollande in an address to the french legislature on monday . 
  officials believe this can be achieved by better linking national intelligence agencies with the schengen information system , a multinational network that is intended to throw up alerts for criminals and suspects at all exterior border crossings . 
  among the measures being considered or accelerated is a new alert for so-called `` foreign fighters '' -- european nationals who are believed to have travelled to iraq and syria to fight alongside extremists . 
  at mr hollande 's request , they are also looking to revive long-stalled legislation that would automatically transmit data on airline passengers to their destination country , a measure being held up the european parliament because of privacy concerns .

   ** instead of demonizing israel , ** bring their experienced , trained experts to europe to develop a coherent counterterror strategy . 
  nice slight of hand here , israel has experienced counterterror experts , so we should stop criticizing the state and listen to what those experts have to say ? 
  i do n't know what ms. ali means by demonizing israel but i certainly do n't think we should shut up or stop criticizing it . 
  israel is the one that is carrying on one of the longest military occupations in history .
