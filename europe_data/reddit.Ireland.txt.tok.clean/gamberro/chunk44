  israel is the state that rules over millions of palestinians who do n't have a right to vote while the israelis is their midst do . 
  israel is the one that has repeatedly invaded and bombed neighboring countries . 
  israel is the state that continues to build settlements in defiance of international law . 
  all of that breeds huge resentment in the region and helps feed the islamists propaganda machine . 
  how many us weapons did isis capture when they overran iraqi army bases ? 
  in many cases the iraqi army simply ran away leading isis to capture them . 
  you can see irish redditors comments on this article [ here .

  i would have taken this seriously .

   `` in europe there is n't any war , '' he told dw . 
  `` if you come to europe , there is food , a place to sleep and there are n't any problems . '', 
  there 's no war that i know of in morocco and the streets are not paved with gold in europe . 
  many european countries were going through a socio-economic crisis ( greece and spain come to mind ) before the migrant one began . 
  ireland too . 
  however , the only time i was caught the police took the drink off me and told me to `` cop on ! '', 
  no arrest or fine and i got to enjoy the rest of my night out . 
  thanks for your reply . 
  i was reading the comments section for another article here and some people thought that this crisis will help rajoy win on 20-d . as an outsider , i would have thought this crisis would work against him ? 
  he fiddled while those bridges burnt ( remind you of nero ? ), 
  or even fueled the flames by ignoring catalan demands and introducing controversial things like the * ley wert . 
  what does this mean ? 
  how many chances does he have until an alternative candidate is put forward or fresh elections are held ? 
  my suspicion ( as an outsider who is following this ) is that romeva or junqueras will be put forward as a compromise with the cup . 
  the spanish media has made this push for independence seem like it 's all about mas . 
  i wonder how they will react if mas is out of the picture . 
  may i ask where in spain are you from ? 
  i mean , put whatever flair you want , but if you are catalan would n't an estelada be more appropriate ? 
  the flip side of that argument would be that the self-declared irish republic did not last very long and was not recognized by britain . 
  when we negotiated with britain after the war that followed , the republic was * de facto * abolished and the irish free state declared ( which was technically not a republic but a british dominion ) . 
  thanks for that . 
  very interesting . 
  i once came across an article about a family of old believers who lived complete isolation ( not even aware of the outside world ) for decades until they were discovered in the 1970s . 
  i stumbled upon this map . 
  however , i 'm sure a more detailed map highlighting those place names is out there . 
  [ suebi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suebi ) actually . 
  there are also many unknowns as to what a united ireland would be like . 
  i suspect , but am by no means certain , that it would be a federal state in order to accommodate northern ireland ( which has a degree of autonomy for some time now ) . 
   `` what is certain is that distancing turkey from the brink of a civil war will be one of the greatest challenges for the country 's next administration . '' i 've seen this a couple of times in articles about turkey . 
  do people mean a civil war between the kurds and the central government ? 
  or if not , who would such a war be between ? 
  ** turkey election : erdogan demands respect after historic victory ** mehul srivastava in ankara the day after his ak party won nearly half of the country 's votes and clinched a parliamentary majority pollsters had not foreseen , president recep tayyip erdogan had a message for the world : learn some respect -- this is democracy , turkish style . 
  `` why do n't they respect the national will ? '' mr erdogan asked journalists on monday , bracketing internal critics and international opinion . 
  `` they have n't displayed respect since the day [ in august last year ] when the national will elected erdogan as president with 52 per cent . 
  one should ask , ` is this your understanding of democracy ? ''' the turkish president continued : `` the entire world needs to respect this -- i have n't seen very much of such respect in the world . '' mr erdogan 's response gives a strong indication of how he intends to conduct his next few years in office . 
  after winning a high stakes gamble to secure the majority that eluded the akp in an election just five months before , he has little time for allegations that he has clamped down on democratic freedoms . 
  now , more than ever , turkey 's future is in the hands of one man and he has made his enemies clear . 
  he also wants turkey 's stance to be taken more into account in the country 's troubled region -- notably in the civil war raging in neighbouring syria -- and in the world . 
  the akp victory is seen as a vindication of his political style . 
  what critics describe as authoritarianism , voters see as strength in uncertain times , and what liberals and minorities decry as polarisation , mr erdogan 's supporters depict as a welcome return to traditional turkish values . 
  at times over the past two years , mr erdogan 's personalised style of government appeared to cost the akp support . 
  but the tough line he took towards adversaries in recent months appeared to boost his party as it advanced 9 percentage points from the previous poll in june . 
  the election did leave a final task unfinished -- the official transformation of the role of president to a muscular , executive office mr erdogan has described as a `` turkish-style presidency . '' to effect such a change , he would have needed the akp to win 330 seats and pass constitutional reforms he could then present to the turkish citizens for a referendum . 
  in the event , the party secured 317 seats . 
  mr erdogan himself says that turkey already has a de facto presidential system , but he could still seek to co-opt opposition members of parliament to bring about constitutional changes . 
  `` this presidential system for him is the real goal . 
  in a way , the electioneering is still going on in the background , '' says naz masraff , at the eurasia group , a risk consultancy . 
  `` so for him , it 's not four years free of elections , it is another important vote that will be coming up soon . '' hours after the victory , mr erdogan 's chief economic adviser , yigit bulut , claimed that if turkey did indeed give the leader the presidential system he wants , the stock market would soar to undreamt of highs and the economy would triple in size . 
  `` welcome , presidency , welcome the new , great , strong , fully independent great turkey , '' mr bulut wrote in the pro-government star newspaper . 
  before that , though , mr erdogan has a long list of enemies to vanquish . 
  among them are the devotees of fethullah gulen , a us-based imam and former ally , whose followers mr erdogan has labelled as terrorists ; enfeebled opposition media groups ; and kurdish militants with whom he has had on-again , off-again peace talks . 
  one adversary , the dogan group , a conglomerate that has interests in media , finance and energy , closed down 13 per cent on monday . 
  mr erdogan has frequently attacked aydin dogan , the group 's patriarch , while an akp member of parliament led a violent mob against the group 's flagship hurriyet paper two months ago . 
  another group , koza-ipek , whose owner is close to mr gulen , lost control of its media outlets last week after they were stormed by police because of the links with the exiled preacher . 
  such uses of police and executive power have caused many foreign leaders to recoil from mr erdogan in recent years . 
  but , faced with the crisis in syria , the rise of isis and the flood of refugees passing through turkey , many have concluded that there is no alternative to dealing with the undisputed strongman of turkish politics . 
  `` us policy issues with turkey could be more manageable under this single party akp government , '' said ross wilson , a former us ambassador to ankara now at the atlantic council , who highlights the virtues of continuity and experience . 
  but he adds that the polarisation of the country -- which seems set to intensify with sunday 's result -- is `` certainly an obvious problem '', 
  i ca n't see any reason why somebody would vote for independence and keep their spanish passports . 
  however , it would be very unfair for unionists to lose their spanish passports if catalonia becomes independent . 
  why do you think ciu ( or cdc now ) is still unionist ? 
  saudi arabia may be hostile to daesh but is less so to other islamist groups . 
  as glenn greenwald highlighted recently , qatar and saudi arabia are funding the al-nusra front ( the al qaeda group ) through the broader coalition called `` the army of conquest . '',

  i feel sorry that most of our infrastructure is geared/based around dublin which is really unfair to people living outside the city ( whether they be irish or foreigners ) .

  the opening sequence was recorded by a helicopter or plane flying over inisheer ( * inis o\u00edrr * ) in the aran islands . 
  if you go there you can see the wreck of a ship that was left stranded in the 1960s and also appears in the opening sequence ( i was there last summer ) . 
  the house that serves as the parochial house is in co. . clare and most of the outdoor stuff was also done there . 
  thank you for your answer . 
  i did n't know about dan schneider and all i have found are board/reddit comments about his alleged crimes . 
  i am not going to rule it out but if it were true , i would suspect that people would have come forward publicly by now . 
  in the common law system ( which is the only one i am familiar with ) , it 's the public prosecutor who takes the case against the plaintiff . 
  i do n't think the victim 's wishes come into it ( although i could be wrong ) . 
  i was told by a hungarian girl that orban boasted about writing the new constitution on his ipad . 
  is there any truth in that ? 
  it 's called `` catalonia : a cultural history '' by michael eaude . 
  at times it reads more like a travel book but other than that it 's pretty good . 
  i read about roger de flor in the book and if i am not mistaken pasquall maragall ( or somebody from the generalitat ) would apologise to the greeks over things he did . 
  i was impressed by the sentiment of apologising for historical wrongs , given that that was a really long time ago . 
  i 'm reading a book about catalonia 's history at the moment ( i 'm a nerd , i know ) . 
  some country you have , lad !, 
  many thanks for your reply . 
  not a fan of france ? 
  turkish redditors , what is discussion about erdogan ( and the akp ) like on turkish social media ? 
  i imagine turkish society is pretty divided about him so i imagine it must get heated , no ? 
  ** edit : ** thank you for your replies . 
  he did n't have to [ suppress the kurdish population either ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dersim_massacre ) and even deny that they were a separate culture ( `` mountain turks '' ) .
