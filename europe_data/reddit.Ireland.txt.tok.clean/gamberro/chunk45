  you mean the the afghan mujahideen from which the taliban would emerge . 
  i do n't think they were ever seen as the `` most progressive faction '' , just one of the most effective at combating the russians . 
  the only comparison i can see is that the ypg are being supported by the west based on their fighting effectiveness * against * the islamists/jihadists . 
  otherwise their ideologies are pretty blatantly different . 
   3 ) reddit regularly remove posts that are damaging to the reputation of house saud . 
  no need to pretend otherwise . 
  sorry , what ? 
  i 've never heard of that before . 
  this is something people do n't seem to appreciate about the migrant crisis . 
  the numbers of people coming from war torn countries ( in addition to the economic migrants ) has shown no sign of letting up and put our resources under immense strain . 
  what is going to happen in 2016 when further hundreds of thousands come ? 
  nobody seems to have a view of the big picture that sadly the flow of people will not stop anytime soon . 
  sounds like an interesting article . 
  if you ever find it , please send it to me . 
  you mean the conservatives goal to `` slim down the state '' and go after people on benefits ? 
  it 's a complicated issue . 
  saying these people have no agency or responsibility for their situation when they skipped school is pushing it in my view , especially when the state provides services like free schooling in france . 
  however , speaking about my own country , it is also pushing it to say that people from deprived areas do n't have huge obstacles to social advancement . 
  what about those already here ? 
  any suggestions on how we defend a tolerant society ? 
  i think it would be a good idea to teach national values ( including to newcomers ) like freedom of religion , separation of church and state . 
  maybe a commitment to those values should also be incorporated into the path people swear at nationalisation ceremonies . 
  has anything changed in the last two weeks . 
  in an ideal world the `` husbands '' would be told by now that child marriages will not be recognised . 
  do you live in ireland or something ? 
  i know the basques were able to resist the romans . 
  let 's see how you fare against zombies . 
  many thanks for your detailed answer . 
  i did n't buy any , nor did my friends . 
  to be honest it was very annoying as i was just there to enjoy the city . 
  i was even doing my bit to speak portuguese ( the european variant , not that thing they speak in brazil ) . 
  what do you mean ? 
  can you give me an explanation ( or a link ) as to how drugs legislation works in portugal now ? 
  i was is lisbon this summer and was offered drugs everywhere in a baixa as well as other places . 
  who is / u/vigorous or why do you single him out ? 
  have you had an argument with him or something ? 
  great !, 
  the zombie apocalypse just had to start here in ireland . 
  what parts of reddit love it , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  ** edit ** thank you for your replies . 
  you forgot to add a / s. 
  i completely agree and i would consider myself a leftist as well . 
  one of the frustrating things about the left on this issue is how idealistic so many people are . 
  many seem to believe that borders should be gotten rid of ( as you say ) and that people should be free to come and go as they please . 
  in an ideal world that could be the case , but we are seriously far from that . 
  at the moment anybody could be arriving in greece or hungary and we have an immense challenge of even ascertaining who they are . 
  in many cases they are travelling on false passports or have even destroyed their papers . 
  at the very least controlling our borders can establish who is crossing . 
  it 's frustrating that that is so impossible for many people on the left . 
  source for that ?

  ** merkel backs multibillion-euro refugee package for turkey ** alex barker , peter spiegel , duncan robinson and jim brunsden in brussels german chancellor angela merkel has backed giving turkey a multibillion-euro aid package to cope with refugees , giving impetus to a provisional eu deal with ankara that aims to slow the flow of migrants to the eu . 
  the ambitious draft deal agreed in ankara between the european commission and recep tayyip erdogan , turkey 's president , turns on a host of sweeteners ankara has sought for years , including visa-free access for turks visiting europe . 
  however , turkey 's most demanding terms await explicit approval from eu member states , some of which remain wary of the high political and financial price that mr erdogan is insisting upon . 
  in a show of goodwill on thursday night , a summit of eu leaders `` welcomed '' the migration `` action plan '' , noted efforts to fast track visa liberalisation , and pledged to `` re-energise '' turkey 's eu membership talks . 
  commission officials briefed eu ambassadors on thursday on the turkish requirements for completing the terms of the action plan , including $ 3bn in fresh funds ; unblocking about five chapters in turkey 's eu membership negotiations ; and visa-free access for 75m turks to the schengen border-free area from as soon as 2016 . 
  eu officials insist no promises were made to mr erdogan beyond an original offer of about $ 500m in assistance from the eu 's budget . 
  but ms merkel made clear that the question of the larger $ 3bn in aid `` did play a role '' in summit deliberations . 
  `` in the future we have to be stronger in burden sharing if we think of the fact that they [ turkey ] have been virtually left alone in the past , '' she said . 
  `` if we say turkey has indeed spent $ 7bn over the past few years , then in turn , that would mean the eu also shoulders a comparable sum . '' mr erdogan also made clear that turkey would expect to be included in an eu `` safe list '' , which would make it easier to reject turkish asylum seekers . 
  he also expects the eu to hold a joint summit with turkey , or invite him to speak to a summit of eu leaders . 
  in return , turkey pledges strengthen its border controls -- including greater co-operation with greece , which has seen a massive influx of refugees from the region . 
  in exchange for visa privileges , turkey would complete a `` readmission '' deal to take back third-country asylum seekers that entered the eu from turkish territory . 
  turkey would eventually also give the 2m syrian refugees a legal route to make a living in turkey , reducing the incentives to attempt to enter europe . 
  eu leaders have viewed mr erdogan with increasing disdain in recent years amid evidence of his creeping authoritarianism . 
  but since europe 's migration crisis overwhelmed the continent , the bloc has scrambled to entice him , knowing his support is essential to stem the flood of asylum seekers coming to europe . 
  ms merkel will visit ankara on sunday , days before a crucial november 1 parliamentary election in which mr erdogan 's justice and development party is fighting to regain its majority . 
  she said her trip would be aimed at setting a more precise timetable for turkey to implement the action plan . 
  turkey hosts about 2m syrian refugees and of the approximately 350,000 asylum seekers that have attempted to enter the eu since january , just 50,000 were stopped at the turkish border . 
  while europe has suddenly become far more forthcoming in its relations with mr erdogan , senior ministers admit that ankara 's terms , including visa liberalisation , may ultimately be impossible for them to deliver . 
  fran\u00e7ois hollande , the french president , stressed any new visa rights or headway in turkey 's membership talks would be contingent on ankara meeting conditions . 
  `` the $ 3bn was suggested by us . 
  it is the quid pro quo for doing it [ clamping down on migration ] . 
  they have raised our expectations , '' turkish officials on the terms of the deal . 
  `` we insisted that this visa liberalisation will happen on an extremely precise and monitored basis . 
  i insisted on this so that there is no misunderstanding or ambiguity , '' he said . 
  diplomats were surprised by the $ 3bn funding demanded by turkey . 
  the commission initially suggested about $ 250m in extra eu funding , topped up to about $ 500m by eu member states . 
  britain is particularly concerned about any funding that would stretch the eu 's common budget beyond its annual limits . 
  several member states -- led by cyprus , which is in a decades-long dispute with ankara over its occupation of half the island -- are also opposed to linking any migration deal to an acceleration of turkey 's stalled eu membership talks . 
  although the eu has agreed in principle to open talks on monetary policy , turkey is demanding that additional chapters are also unfrozen on justice , fundamental rights , energy and education . 
  the eu is struggling to respond to a surge of desperate migrants that has resulted in thousands of deaths since the beginning of the year perhaps the most sensitive issue among member states is visa liberalisation . 
  turkey is the only eu membership candidate not given visa benefits , a perceived injustice mr erdogan would want fixed before he fully enacts a `` readmission '' deal to take back syrians illegally entering the eu . 
  the existing `` road map '' with the eu foresees visa liberalisation as soon as 2017 but it is full of difficult political and technical conditions , including the effective recognition of cyprus . 
  while brussels insists the conditions would not be watered down , it wants the process accelerated to 2016 . 
  before the migration crisis , france and germany opposed such liberalisation ; senior ministers still make clear in private that giving such rights to turks may be impossible to sell to their voters . 
  the talks in ankara between turkish officials and frans timmermans , the commission 's vice-president , stretched into the early hours of thursday . 
  the draft deal was finally endorsed during a meeting with mr erdogan . 
  what is the situation like at the checkpoints ? 
  i mean , can migrants enter and claim asylum in bulgaria ? 
  this . 
  when i first discovered reddit , i wondered who this ron paul guy was that kept making it to the top of / r/politics and other threads . 
  i figured he must be a significant contender for the white house or somebody in favor of pretty progressive policies . 
  imagine my surprise when i discovered he was a libertarian , admirer of austrian economics and in favor of bringing back the gold standard . 
  no , i am not although the user above seems to have missed that and the user / u/23powerz has pointed it out . 
  i accept that we are treating european citizens returning from syria differently than those who were accused of war crimes in the balkan wars or wwii . 
  but making this about white people being treated differently from muslims ( as the user above was implying ) seems idiotic to me . 
  was n't the point of the user / u/ganyobalkanski above that white people who commit war crimes get a `` criminal tribunal at the hague '' whereas muslims do n't ? 
  this . 
  i would also like to add that muslims accused of committing war crimes [ have been brought to the hague .
