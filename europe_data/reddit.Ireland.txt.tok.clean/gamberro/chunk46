  i , for one , do n't want there to be a civil war or any more violence in turkey . 
  if you read the article it appears to be warning about future instability and violence . 
   as for stronger security , i feel perfectly secure . 
  britain is n't under any threat from russia like some eastern european countries might be . 
  the eu is now trying to recruit ukraine , which is about the only conceivable way our soldiers could end up in the sights of an ak47 . 
  the crisis in ukraine is ( at least if not more ) a consequence of nato expansion as it is the eu , as highlighted by [ gorbachev 's remarks about broken promises ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nato-s-eastward-expansion-did-the-west-break-its-promise-to-moscow-a-663315.html ) surrounding nato not moving `` one inch '' to the east . 
  funny how i 've seen british euroskeptics bring up the eu and ukraine many times , but never the bigger context of military expansion with nato . 
  i wonder how many of you guys would like the uk to pull out of nato as you are supposedly all about transferring sovereignty back to the uk . 
  if i really wanted to provoke , i 'd point out the irony of britain turning a blind eye towards aggression targeted eastern european states given britain 's history of [ fighting against the opposite .

  out of curiosity , how is columbus seen nowadays in catalonia ? 
  i know there is the pla\u00e7a de col\u00f3n in barcelona and have also heard the theory that he was catalan . 
  the golden harp on a blue background would also make a nice flag . 
  however , that 's our coat of arms , so we do n't entirely miss out on that . 
  upvoted for the basque flag or * ikurri\u00f1a . 
  * it 's pretty awesome . 
  i 'm obviously biased towards the irish tricolour . 
  but with regards foreign flags , i 've often thought georgia , macedonia and greece have beautiful flags . 
  wales is pretty great too . 
  i mean it 's hard to beat a mythical creature on your flag . 
   then it started to bring europe together so it could do more under the european control . 
  what are you on about ? 
  the euro , probably one of the biggest steps towards integration to date , was a franco-german idea , not something germany came up with on its own . 
  it eventually was seen as the price germany had to pay for reunification . 
   but nations basically spoiled that and the eu is a big pile of wasted money . 
  nations , including germany , spoiled that by agreeing to create a monetary union without a banking , fiscal or political union . 
  in the absence of the latter , the eurozone remains an intergovernmental system ( dominated by germany as it happens ) and significantly undemocratic . 
  germany , along with other countries , is not interested in moving towards a fiscal or political union that might get us out of this mess due to the political difficulties that would involve . 
  that is the reality of the mess we find ourselves in . 
  if we are going to apply guilt by association to people based on their ethnic backgrounds , then yes . 
  turkey , like britain , also has a very long horrible history of imperialism , including genocide and cultural suppression . 
  she seems to be pretty damn deluded that 's for sure . 
  thank you . 
  i 'm sorry but i do n't speak german . 
  can you give me a brief idea as to what i am looking at in the video you posted ? 
  sorry to hear that . 
  do n't take it personally , they are just imaginary internet points after all . 
  thanks . 
  what do you think is dishonest about romeva ? 
  that does n't make much sense to me . 
  what 's the name of the security adviser you are referring to ? 
  jeez , that 's seriously messed up . 
  i had heard of a few of those things in australia but i had no idea about some of the others . 
  i do n't know enough about the conflict in yemen ( ignorance on my side ) to comment on the houthis etc. 
  but i do know that for every time the saudis have collaborated in the fight against al qaeda , they have created countless more salafists in the west and around the world whose ideology is a big threat to our societies . 
  it 's that ideology that has helped create islamic state and countless other jihadi groups . 
  brits of this subreddit , your cities are generally more beautiful architecturally than ours . 
  the bbc is great and we are jealous of the nhs . 
  i could write a much longer list of the things i like about the brits and the uk but others here have done it better than me . 
  either way the brits are and should feel welcome here in my opinion . 
  not just lizards but liberal elites and globalists !!, 
   wonder why they would prefer him over hillary ... because he 's willing to accept russian aggression towards ukraine ( including its annexation of crimea ) and is ambivalent towards nato . 
  just a detail , the term in english is `` early elections '' ` or `` anticipated elections . '', 
  my spanish friends sometimes make that mistake too . 
  i completely agree . 
  well , i upvoted you . 
  but maybe venturi has some closet fans here on / r/europe . 
  what do you mean by happy merchants ? 
  there is a post over on / r/askhistorians [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1wwo9u/what_was_the_truth_behind_the_allies_accusations/cf6263i/ ) on this very topic . 
  while there were claims that were false/exaggerated for propaganda purposes , there were other abuses that should not be forgotten including summary executions of civilians and use of forced labour by the germans . 
  thanks . 
  who or what is a venturi ? 
  pardon my ignorance . 
  that 's an impressive statue and quite beautiful with the cherry trees in bloom . 
  well , after many european/american [ diplomats , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victoria_nuland#leaked_phone_conversation ) [ politicians ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10721638/tymoshenko-condemns-russian-leaks.html ) and political officials emails were hacked by groups linked to the russian government , i am glad the same has finally happened to them . 
  ** germany withdraws approval for chinese takeover of tech group ** * berlin reopens probe into aixtron deal amid protectionist backlash against china * aixtron shareholders had been offered $ 6 per ordinary share , valuing the german company at about $ 670m by : guy chazan in berlin the german government has withdrawn approval for the $ 670m takeover of chip equipment maker aixtron by a group of chinese investors , amid concern in berlin about china 's growing appetite for german industrial companies . 
  matthias machnig , deputy economics minister , told newspaper die welt that the government had decided to take back the clearance certificate it had issued last month and reopen a review of the deal after receiving `` previously unknown security-related information '' . 
  by late afternoon on monday , aixtron 's shares had fallen 13 per cent to $ 5.00 in frankfurt , less than the $ 6 per ordinary share takeover offer from fujian grand chip investment fund , which is controlled by the chinese businessman zhendong liu . 
  management has already recommended the offer and , by last week , some 65 per cent of shareholders had accepted it . 
  the decision reflects a growing protectionist backlash against chinese investment in germany . 
  sigmar gabriel , the economics minister and deputy chancellor , has already backed a proposal to restrict foreign takeovers of eu companies if they involve `` key technologies that are of particular importance for further industrial progress '' . 
  however , even under current rules , the economics ministry can review any deal where non-eu investors acquire at least 25 per cent of the voting rights of a german company , and block it if it `` poses a threat to germany 's public order or security '' . 
  deals that involve `` security of supply in the event of a crisis , telecommunications and electricity , or the provision of services of strategic importance '' can come in for particular scrutiny , the ministry says on its website . 
  mr gabriel 's initiative , which would greatly expand the government 's oversight of these and other deals , is supported by g\u00fcnther oettinger , the eu 's digital economy commissioner and a close ally of chancellor angela merkel . 
  he said in a newspaper interview earlier this month that europe 's high-tech industry `` should not just be sold off '' , adding that other big eu member states such as france and italy also backed a `` stronger industrial policy '' to protect homegrown tech companies . 
  other countries have also grown more sceptical of chinese investment . 
  in january , go scale , a chinese private equity firm , was blocked from buying lumileds , philips ' lighting business . 
  german concerns over chinese takeovers have been rife since midea , a chinese appliance maker , bought german robotmaker kuka -- one of the country 's most innovative engineering companies -- earlier this year for $ 4.5 bn . 
  ministers tried and failed to drum up an alternative bid from a european rival , whilems merkel complained about a lack of reciprocity on the part of the chinese , pointing to the tough restrictions beijing places on investments by german companies . 
  germany has become the top destination for chinese dealmaking in europe in recent months . 
  transactions with a record value of $ 10.8 bn were announced in the first half of this year , according to ey , the professional services firm . 
  chinese investors acquired 37 german companies in that period , compared with 39 in the whole of 2015 . 
  a further sign of chinese interest in german companies came earlier this month when san ' an optoelectronics announced it had held talks with osram on a possible acquisition of the german lighting and semiconductor company . 
  san ' an is one of two potential chinese bidders for osram , which was spun off from siemens in 2013 . 
  go scale has also held talks with osram in the past few weeks , according to people close to the discussions . 
  let 's be honest about it , controlling immigration played a big part in the outcome of the referendum , did it not ? 
  i think it 's normal for people of immigrant background to question whether they are welcome in the country if the government/the electorate wants to stop people like them from coming in the future ( i 'm referring to the migration from the countries that joined the eu in 2004 ) . 
  do the british people view the numbers that arrived post 2004 as a mistake ? 
  would they do the same if they could go back now ? 
  are the poles and others living there now welcome in the uk ? 
  i think it 's fair to ask those questions whether or not others agree . 
   as i keep telling people , concerns about immigration does not make someone racist . 
  i completely agree . 
  france has serious problems but i do n't think we can compare that to a failed state like somalia or syria or that its problems meet the definition of failed state :  a failed state is a political body that has disintegrated to a point where basic conditions and responsibilities of a sovereign government no longer function properly . 
  likewise , when a nation weakens and its standard of living declines , it introduces the possibility of governmental collapse . 
  the fund for peace characterizes a failed state as having the following characteristics : loss of control of its territory , or of the monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force therein , erosion of legitimate authority to make collective decisions , inability to provide public services , inability to interact with other states as a full member of the international community . 
  ** deal to create ` road map ' for ukraine peace ** * merkel , putin , hollande and poroshenko revive stalled plan but key divisions remain * october 18 , 2016 5 hours ago by : stefan wagstyl in berlin ukraine , russia , germany and france agreed to prepare a `` road map '' to implement a stalled peace plan for conflict-torn eastern ukraine but left open key questions that still divide kiev and moscow . 
  at a hastily organised summit in berlin , the four countries ' leaders argued that the minsk agreement , signed 20 months ago , remained the only way to reach a ceasefire and political settlement even though ukraine , russia and the russia-backed separatists in eastern ukraine have so far failed to implement the accord . 
  `` today , too , has worked no wonders , '' said german chancellor angela merkel .
