  but she added that to put an end to `` the daily infringements of the ceasefire '' was `` worth every effort '' . 
  after five hours of talks about his country , ukraine 's president petro poroshenko left the meeting and ms merkel and french president fran\u00e7ois hollande confronted russia 's vladimir putin over syria . 
  they emphasised russia 's responsibility for the bombing of aleppo , which mr hollande condemned as a `` war crime '' and ms merkel called `` inhumane '' . 
  the russian president responded by promising to extend the current temporary pause in the bombardment , but he did not give details . 
  the ukraine talks were the first in a year in the so-called normandy format -- involving the four powers behind the minsk agreement . 
  ms merkel had earlier insisted there should be no new meeting without progress on the ground , especially in reducing the daily violent clashes between separatists and kiev 's forces . 
  however , she changed her mind and called the summit , possibly to show moscow-friendly politicians in germany and elsewhere in the eu that she was keeping open the communication lines to mr putin . 
  ms merkel said the main progress at the meeting was to agree on a road map -- to be completed by foreign ministers in november -- that would contain sequencing details not in the original minsk accord . 
  the agreement follows months of argument between kiev and moscow about the timing of key measures , with mr poroshenko saying a full ceasefire must come before ukraine can implement promised political reforms involving decentralising power to its regions , and mr putin accusing kiev of delaying the reforms . 
  the parties also agreed that armed monitors from the organization for security and co-operation in europe could be deployed , although the timing of such a move was left unclear . 
  mr putin said the osce could `` broaden its mission '' . 
  mr poroshenko said : `` there is no alternative to the normandy format . 
  this road map should have the sequence of the implementation of the minsk agreements and guarantee their implementation . '' speaking to journalists about syria , mr hollande and ms merkel said they had made clear to mr putin their condemnation of the bombing of aleppo and had pressed him to extend the temporary ceasefire . 
  at a separate press briefing , mr putin appeared conciliatory , holding out the hope of a lasting halt to the air strikes beyond the eight-hour pause planned for thursday . 
  `` we informed them [ mr hollande and ms merkel ] of our intention to continue , as much as possible ... a pause in the air strikes . 
  we are ready to do this for as long as there are no clashes with rebel formations entrenched in aleppo . '' however , mr putin 's pledge comes at a time when moscow has dispatched most of its baltic fleet , including its only aircraft carrier , to the eastern mediterranean . 
  reuters news agency quoted a nato diplomat saying that the ships were bringing more fighter-bombers to participate in the aleppo bombing . 
   7,770 refugees and asylum-seekers sought help at caritas listening centers over the course of 2015 . 
  these consisted mainly of men ( 92.4 % ) , aged 18 to 34 ( 79.2 % ) , who mostly came from african and south-central asian countries . 
  these people , as the caritas dossier explains , are frequently illiterate ( 26 % ) or have only attained moderate educational degrees ( 16.5 % had only received an elementary school education , 22.8 % junior high degrees ) . 
  this is a side point but the very low levels of education among the migrants arriving and requiring help should be concerning too in my opinion . 
  how are they supposed to integrate or provide for themselves in an economy that is increasingly automated , deindustrialized and has fewer jobs that do n't require a high-school level of education . 
  oh i remember that guy . 
  i used to be mildly interested in propaganda islamists were spreading and would stumble upon his videos from time to time . 
  look up his video `` the collapse of atheism '' if you want a good laugh . 
  richard dawkins destroyed one of his creationist books [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z167dmpt_zw ) for anybody that 's interested . 
  it 's especially ironic as people like farage are now appearing at trump rallies and effectively campaigning for him . 
  is that not `` foreign intervention '' ? 
  while the clintons are powerful people , hillary is not president of the us . 
  how is she behind this ? 
  the ecuadorian government ( under correa ) has been determined to pursue its own course in the world , independent of the united states . 
  offering sanctuary to assange in the london embassy forms part of that . 
  despite provoking the ire of the * current * president and us administration , ecuador continued on its course as they was little the us could do . 
  why would they cave into pressure now particularly from somebody who is not even president ? 
  correct me if i 'm mistaken but is n't breitbart quite anti-free market ( as part of its `` anti-globalist '' approach ) ? 
  that was my understanding of the site from reading some articles from it . 
  thanks for your reply . 
  i stand corrected so . 
  indeed , his call for the uk to remain did not have weight in the uk . 
  however , it was enough to [ annoy people like farage ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/nigel-farage-barack-obama-behaved-disgracefully-by-campaigning-against-brexit-eu-referendum/ ) who deemed it disgraceful for him to intervene in another country 's election . 
  that was despite farage campaigning in other country 's elections/referenda ( including in mine ) . 
  out of curiosity , just how popular is breitbart in the uk ? 
  ** uk looks at paying billions into eu budget after brexit ** * plan would let finance sector keep single-market access * yesterday by : george parker and martin arnold in london and alex barker in brussels britain would continue to pay billions of pounds into the eu budget after brexit to maintain cherished single-market access for the city of london and other sectors under plans being discussed by theresa may 's cabinet . 
  the prime minister 's demand that britain controls its borders and throws off the jurisdiction of eu judges has led many in london and brussels to conclude that british-based banks and insurers would inevitably lose the `` passporting '' rights that allows them to trade freely in europe . 
  but in a move likely to upset many conservative eurosceptics , mrs may has not ruled out making future payments to the eu to secure privileged access to the single market . 
  finance is among the sectors most likely to benefit in any deal that recognised the `` equivalence '' of regulatory regimes . 
  on friday , she assured japanese carmaker nissan that trading conditions for its sunderland car plant would not change after brexit , in the first suggestion that the government could pick favoured sectors to shield from the impact of leaving the eu . 
  several senior ministers have told the financial times that the cabinet is considering how britain could carry on paying billions of pounds into the eu budget . 
  `` we would have to be careful how we explained it , '' said one minister . 
  `` but theresa has been very careful not to rule it out . '' another senior tory said : `` with theresa , you have to listen carefully to the silences . '' the office for national statistics said the average annual net british contribution to the eu between 2010-14 was # 7.1 bn , once the uk rebate and the flow of money back from brussels to projects and institutions in the uk was taken into account . 
  on top of any future eu payments after brexit , the uk will also face a divorce bill from the bloc for as much as $ 20bn , according to a financial times analysis . 
  to appease tory brexiters , ministers are looking at ways to finesse future payments . 
  for example , britain might make bigger-than-expected contributions to eu security programmes or use the aid budget to fund european projects . 
  bankers are pushing the british government to find a way for the sector to keep as many of its passporting rights to access the eu single market as possible . 
  they argue that falling back on schemes that have regulatory equivalence with the eu is too risky and would not prevent them from moving jobs from the uk . 
  oliver letwin , david cameron 's former policy chief , said it was vital that britain was able to sell retail financial services across the eu . 
  `` if we have to buy this market access by making continuing contributions to eu budgets , that may well be a price worth paying , given the number of uk jobs that are involved , '' he said . 
  but conor burns , a eurosceptic conservative mp , said : `` leaving the eu does n't mean paying money into the eu . '' he said that had been specifically rejected by the british people at the referendum on june 23 . 
  donald tusk , european council president , said last week that `` the essence of brexit '' appeared to include no further budget contributions ; he said the uk was heading for a `` radical '' break , with much looser economic relations in future . 
  but one senior eu diplomat said : `` even before the brexit vote , the role of the city of london was precarious . 
  they had an issue with the euro 's financial centre being outside the eurozone . 
  now that it is outside the eu , it is game over [ for passporting ] . '' british ministers are considering making further eu budget contributions during any transitional period between brexit , expected in 2019 , and the conclusion of any european free-trade deal , which could take many more years to agree . 
  the payments could extend even beyond that period . 
  another senior eu diplomat said : `` there will have to be a budgetary contribution through the transition . '' however , the rebate secured by margaret thatcher in the 1980s would probably end . 
  ministers are considering options for brexit and downing street is refusing to be drawn on its negotiating stance , calling any debate on future budget contributions `` minutiae '' . 
  i 've seen this argument a couple of times from pro-brexit users , usually to make the argument that scotland is getting a free ride . 
  i think it 's pretty clear though that this is a result of fptp and the vote for parties like the snp being concentrated in a certain area ( scotland ) . 
  a similar thing happens in northern ireland and results in parties from there ( like the dup and sinn f\u00e9in ) getting way more seats than ukip . 
  ** syriza at odds with orthodox clergy over religious teaching plans ** * premier tsipras treads carefully on reform as greek church holds political sway * october 14 , 2016 by : kerin hope in athens damned as a `` wretched man '' and `` religious racist '' who should be excommunicated , greece 's minister of education has ignited the anger of hardline orthodox clerics with his plans to reduce their role in religious teaching . 
  under the reforms , due to be introduced next year , the state will take control of religious education in schools , broadening it out to include other faiths . 
  `` in our [ party 's ] opinion , religious studies are too confessional -- they try to persuade pupils of the correctness of orthodoxy , which is not the job of the educational system , '' said nikos filis . 
  `` we 've taken the decision to go ahead with changes [ in the religious studies curriculum ] to reflect the increasing diversity of faiths in our society , especially following the arrival in greece of so many refugees . '' it is the latest salvo in a battle between syriza -- a hard left party which once campaigned for the separation of church and state -- and a religious establishment that still holds huge political sway . 
  more than 70 per cent of greeks are of the orthodox faith but fewer than 50 per cent are regular churchgoers . 
  the church plays a huge role in greek life . 
  the more than 100 soup kitchens set up in athens to help people hit by the economic crisis are mostly run by church volunteers . 
  other religions have comparatively few followers . 
  there is a small catholic community and a greek muslim minority in thrace . 
  the wider muslim community has been boosted by the arrival of an estimated 100,000 immigrants and refugees . 
  `` we respect the role of the church and we listen to its opinion but it 's the state that has the legal responsibility for drawing up the curriculum and overseeing schools , '' said mr filis , in his sprawling ministry , where many offices are hung with icons of orthodox saints . 
  the church 's prominent role in education harks back to the so-called `` secret schools '' run by orthodox priests to keep the greek language and culture alive during four centuries of ottoman rule . 
  since greece won independence in the 1830s , politics and religion have been closely entwined . 
  but to many greeks the church is now a repository of outdated nationalism and an obstacle to modernising society . 
  these days , both parents and pupils complain that the curriculum for religious studies , a compulsory subject taught exclusively by theology graduates and priests , focuses too narrowly on eastern orthodox christianity , the established greek religion . 
  `` my children say they get bored with religious studies because there 's too much catechism and no discussion of any other faith . 
  it 's only two hours a week but they want to opt out , '' said angela asimakopoulou , a mother of two athens high school students . 
  `` i do n't mind that priests do some teaching but they need to open up the syllabus . '' politicians from the centre-right and the centre-left remain reluctant to antagonise an institution that still wields influence over a large pool of voters . 
  while alexis tsipras , the prime minister , is an avowed atheist who refused to take a religious oath of office when he was sworn in , he has since cultivated a friendly relationship with archbishop ieronymos , the moderate head of the greek orthodox church . 
  the government has settled for loosening ties between church and state rather than push for a separation , which polls suggest 70 per cent of voters favour , in part to pacify its coalition partners . 
  panos kammenos , leader of the rightwing independent greeks , has threatened to walk out if syriza persists with its plans to reform religious education . 
  for his part , mr filis has been targeted by an extremist faction in the orthodox hierarchy . 
  bishop ambrosios of kalavryta , an outspoken supporter of greece 's neo-nazi golden dawn party , has said that the education minister should be excommunicated . 
  he called for church bells to ring out across his diocese to underline his condemnation of the education minister as `` a wretched man , lacking education and understanding of anything sacred '' . 
  bishop seraphim of piraeus called him `` a religious racist '' . 
  even among moderate prelates , the proposed reforms have struck a nerve . 
  archbishop ieronymos has said that `` some greeks do n't love the orthodox church and want to de-christianise it '' . 
  so far mr filis has shrugged off the threats . 
  `` it 's not the first time the church has reacted in this way to measures that the majority of society believes are timely , '' he said , citing previous opposition to the introduction of cremation and the construction of athens ' first modern mosque . 
  mariana fotiades , a consultant , said : `` our society is becoming more secular even in the countryside and i think the educational changes will help bring greeks closer to the rest of europe . '', 
  he 's a fan of the alt-right . 
  for many such people the mainstream media is heavily biased or lying .
