  that 's why they get their news from unbiased sources like breitbart , fox news and the `` hillary for jail '' facebook page . 
  no , no ... that does n't confirm to the confirmation bias of the user above about the `` lying media . '', 
  i would have liked the police to have access to information on other plots , cells and contacts this guy had . 
  ** turks caught up in gulenists crackdown seek justice ** thousands accused after failed coup feel they have been unfairly treated * by : laura pitel in adapazari * when she returned to her old school to pick up some papers after being suspended , the religious affairs teacher from the turkish town of adapazari was braced for some awkward glances . 
  but she was not prepared to be treated as an outcast by colleagues of eight years ' standing . 
  `` they would n't even look at me , '' says the mother-of-three , dabbing her cheek with a tissue . 
  `` it was as if i was a terrorist . '' the teacher , who asked not to be named , insists she had nothing to do with the coup attempt that rocked turkey three months ago . 
  but a few weeks after her suspension -- without any hearing or trial -- she was formally dismissed by a public decree that accused her and thousands of others of colluding with the plotters . 
  more than 100,000 people have been arrested , suspended or sacked since the failed putsch using emergency powers that were last week extended for a further three months . 
  the impact has shuddered through communities such as adapazari , the largest town in turkey 's western sakarya province , creating new divisions in a society already marred by polarisation and mistrust . 
  for the teacher , who has resorted to taking anti-depressants , the episode has left her confused , angry and isolated . 
  `` i feel so alone , '' she says . 
  recep tayyip erdogan , turkey 's president , blames fethullah gulen , an exiled islamic cleric , for masterminding the plot that resulted in the death of 270 people -- a claim he denies . 
  following the coup he launched a crackdown to cleanse turkey 's state machinery and public institutions of gulenist supporters . 
  but after a brief period of post-putsch unity , a growing number of opposition figures are now warning that the purge is going too far and is wreaking havoc on turkish society . 
  a commission set up by the secularist republican people 's party ( chp ) has been contacted by 35,000 people who claim that they have been wrongfully tainted . 
  it was at one of the party 's local branches that the religious affairs teacher told her story . 
  she was among more than 60 teachers , civil servants and businesspeople -- or , in the case of those behind bars , their spouses -- who waited for hours to talk with engin ozkoc , a senior mp with the party . 
  thickly set but softly spoken , mr ozkoc nodded sympathetically as clusters of newly jobless constituents were ushered in to explain how their lives had been turned upside down by what they felt was their unjust treatment . 
  they told of looming mortgage payments and unpaid bills , of ostracisation by friends , neighbours and even family -- and of children now begging not to be sent to face the bullies at school . 
  engin ozturk , an mp with the opposition republican people 's party , meets constituents who have lost their jobs in the purge following the july coup attempt it is ironic that the chp , a bastion of traditional turkish secularism , has become the chief defender of those accused of links to the pious gulenist movement . 
  one teacher wearing a headscarf admits she always believed the party hated people like her . 
  nor is mr ozkoc a fan of the gulenists , which for years worked closely with mr erdogan 's ruling justice and development party ( akp ) until a dramatic falling-out in 2013 . 
  but he says no one else is listening to those who feel wronged : `` this is the only place the victims can turn to for help . '' the mp concedes that supporters of the us-based mr gulen were able to establish a strong foothold in the socially conservative sakarya province . 
  one man accused by the government of being a senior coup plotter was a theology professor at the local university . 
  one of the reasons that about 30,000 of turkey 's 850,000 teachers have been caught up in the purge is that the gulen movement is accused of using schools to find new recruits . 
  but mr ozkoc also says the justifications and processes used to dismiss people are unjust . 
  of more than 400 people who have sought help from the chp in sakarya , he says most have been punished for meeting one of three criteria : they belonged to the aktif egitim-sen teaching union , they sent a child to a gulen-linked school , or held an account with bank asya , an islamic lender seized by the government last year . 
  the religious affairs teacher , who denies being a gulen supporter , was given no reason for her sacking but she borrowed money from bank asya and was a member of the union . 
  mr ozkoc does not dispute that these organisations had ties to the gulenist movement . 
  but , he argues , they were allowed to operate legally and interacting with them should not necessarily be a crime . 
  one woman who came to him appears to have been sacked for having a bank asya account that contained just 2.17 turkish lira ( about 60p ) . 
  a growing number of opposition figures are warning that the purge initiated by recep tayyip erdogan , centre , is going too far . 
  he accuses the ruling elite of pursuing the small fish but glossing over the extensive ties that for years existed between gulenists and the highest levels of government . 
  directly addressing turkey 's leaders , he asks : `` why are n't you guilty ? 
  that 's our question . '' the turkish government argues that even ordinary followers who simply admire mr gulen 's teaching form the foundation of support for a clandestine group , and pose a danger to the state . 
  ahmet berat conkar , an mp with the ruling akp , believes citizens should have heeded years of vociferous government warnings that the gulen movement was a terrorist organisation . 
  anyone who had been genuinely wronged could take their case to one of the `` crisis centres '' set up to correct mistakes , he adds . 
  for those already tarnished by being named in the government 's public list of dismissals , it is little consolation . 
  they have already lost their careers , their incomes and many of their friends . 
  after hours spent advising dozens of anxious and frustrated people , elif yar , a lawyer working with the chp , wondered aloud : `` where will this anger go ? '' `` it 's polarising our society , '' adds the sacked teacher . 
  `` this breakdown of trust will take years to cure . '', 
  sometimes i wonder if trump is a clinton plant/stooge . 
  because irrespective of whether he wins , from now on whenever people talk about securing borders or taking steps to reduce immigration , they will receive reactions like this one . 
  wow ... that is horrific .

  i misread that as four nuclear reactors . 
  i was slightly disappointed by the reality . 
  perhaps the independent did . 
  i did n't editorialise the headline . 
   `` look , could anyone tell me a general election in which everything said was capable of being repeated on oath ? 
  answer : no , never . 
  election promises and/or lies often come back to haunt the people who make them . 
  to try to say they do n't matter or are unimportant is na\u00efve in my opinion . 
  i do n't think it 's fair to say that the british in favour of brexit have been indoctrinated . 
  people base their opinions on various things and what they read in the media is only part of it . 
  however , i will say that british tabloids in particularly have repeatedly published falsehoods about the eu * for decades . 
  * [ here ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/euromyths-a-z-index/ ) is a list that the eu has tried to debunk . 
  thanks for that . 
  have a good day now . 
  i 'm sure they are going both directions and i am sorry that that has happened to you as well as others who are pro-brexit . 
  in retrospect i should n't have posted the comment above and apologise if i offended anybody . 
  not at all . 
  just bear in mind that while people might dismiss the express as a rubbish or marginal newspaper , it still sells more copies than the guardian . 
  take from that what you will . 
  confirmation bias does not just affect the remain side or those who are disappointed by you leaving . 
  [ quite the contrary . 
  i have been insulted quite a few times by pro-brexit users that seem quite active on / r/the _ donald and other alt-right forums . 
  i am not going to stoop to their level or argue that all brexiteers are like them . 
  but i do think a bit of satire like in my comment above is more than justified . 
  you are just getting your information from news outlets like the guardian that are heavily biased about brexit and the eu in general . 
  i get my news from the telegraph , breitbart and the `` eu is pure evil '' facebook page . 
  interesting chart . 
  by some people 's logic , the madrile\u00f1os could also say `` espa\u00f1a nos roba . '', 
  chilaquiles were the best dish that i tried when i was in mexico city .

  is the state of tamaulipas really in the control of the cartels ? 
  how do they control the government there if you do n't mind me asking . 
  i just looked him up and he seems like quite the horrible human being on many levels . 
  to cite one example :  in april 2014 , zhirinovsky made strong verbal threats against a pregnant journalist during a press conference in the duma , including ordering his aide to rape the journalist , who had asked zhirinovsky about possible sanctions against ukraine amidst the military tensions between the two countries . 
  erdogan is working on becoming a new sultan . 
  does that count ? 
  does it bother them that those islands have a greek majority and are unlikely to want to become part of turkey ? 
  ** catalan leader sees two options : referendum or referendum ** carles puigdemont insists he is ready to negotiate with madrid but says matter must be put to a vote * yesterday by : tobias buck in madrid * the leader of catalonia has promised to hold an independence referendum in september next year , saying the controversial creation of a breakaway state from spain was `` possible , necessary and irreversible '' . 
  carles puigdemont was speaking to the regional parliament on the eve of a confidence vote that he is widely expected to win . 
  he insisted that he was ready to negotiate over the future status of catalonia with the government of spain , but made clear that there was -- in his view -- only one way to end the simmering conflict : `` a referendum or a referendum . '' the prosperous region in the north east of spain has seen a sharp rise in secessionist sentiment in recent years , expressed in annual mass rallies in favour of independence , and a steady increase in support for separatist parties . 
  mr puigdemont himself leads the first openly pro-independence government in recent catalan history , after separatist parties won a majority of seats in the regional parliament in barcelona . 
  his government came to office in january this year promising to achieve independence from spain in 18 months -- meaning the deadline has now been pushed back slightly . 
  the broader contours of the independence road map , however , were reiterated by mr puigdemont on wednesday , not least the plan to build up `` the structures of the state '' between now and the middle of next year . 
  these include the creation of a catalan tax authority , and a string of laws that would prepare the legal `` disconnection '' from spain . 
  mr puigdemont 's promise comes at a critical moment for the catalan independence movement , which is under pressure to show that it can and will deliver on its promises . 
  this month 's pro-independence rally -- which is held every year on september 11 , catalan national day -- saw a decline in participants , prompting talk of fatigue inside the secessionist camp . 
  catalonia 's independence leaders face growing pressure to deliver with opposition from madrid and internal splits , analysts struggle to see viable path to self-rule . 
  despite his defiant tone on wednesday , the floppy-haired catalan leader and his government face formidable obstacles . 
  the first lies in madrid , where the conservative government of mariano rajoy -- backed by much of the country 's political and legal establishment -- is implacably opposed to catalan independence . 
  over the past two years , spain 's constitutional court has struck down several secessionist declarations and measures , and will probably do so again with mr puigdemont 's latest referendum plan . 
  closer to home , the regional president has to contend with a brittle and disparate majority in parliament .
