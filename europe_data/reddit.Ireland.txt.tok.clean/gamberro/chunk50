  but i do think it 's reasonable to put in the nationality . 
  if they are syrian nationals , it 's likely to involve people who travelled to germany ( whether recently or some time ago ) . 
  the fact is that some of these people are quite radical when they come or are radicalised here in salafist/extremist mosques . 
  omitting their nationality seems to me like sweeping the problem under the rug and pretending it does n't exist . 
  same here ( and believe me it rains a lot over here too ) . 
  i think we were the first country to introduce such a law . 
  before that bars/pubs were full of cigarette smoke . 
  what the judge said . 
   why they still have the status than ? 
  political correctness among other reasons means it is very difficult to talk about this or get a government to change its policies . 
  you would n't happen to have a source for that ? 
  because a quick google search revealed nothing . 
  cameron put it better than anybody else : `` for heaven 's sake man , go ! '', 
  the message has n't gone through though . 
  how can he continue without the support of his parliamentary colleagues ? 
  i admit that in the immediate aftermath of the brexit vote this sub became a bit of a shitshow of anti-uk feeling . 
  what you wrote is all true . 
  however , there was a certain amount of overlap between the two in that ukip 's only mp had the # 350 million claim made by vote leave on his twitter account . 
  was it the british government saying that or was it the british tabloids ? 
  ** edit : ** [ a list of the false stories ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/euromyths-a-z-index/ ) printed by the british tabloids about the eu that have been debunked . 
  cameron insinuated that brexit would lead to [ increased risk of war in europe . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/08/cameron-brexit-will-increase-risk-of-europe-descending-into-war/ ), 
  i do n't think being a republic or not comes into it to be honest . 
  maybe they found it rude that i approached/addressed them in a language that was n't theirs without asking first if they spoke english . 
  it was probably my fault . 
  when i was in flanders , the locals seemed to mind if i addressed them in english . 
  there are about six primary schools and one secondary school that teach in catalan over there . 
  i do n't know what percentage that is of the total but with about 600 pupils that is clearly very small . 
  it seems to remain a private initiative without any significant government support . 
  you 're right in that there was no choice for the people there or catalonia/kingdom of aragon over what kingdom they would belong to . 
  as a nerd , i came across a reference to rousillon falling to the french at the time of ferdinand ii of aragon but later being restored . 
  so it seems that the french kings had their eyes set in those territories for a while . 
  if i 'm not mistaken they were also one of the wealthiest parts of catalonia . 
  look it up as it applies to what you are saying here and the concept of the * pa\u00efsos catalans * that includes northern catalonia . 
  perpignan and rousillon have been part of france for many centuries and there is no significant political movement to change that . 
  the people there are free to decide whatever they want to be including being part of france . 
  the idea that rousillon will be freely given back or reunited with catalonia when there is no significant support for any such move seems more than a tad ridiculous lad . 
  what is it then ? 
  what is this thing that has been there for a long time in france ? 
  hatred between the muslim and non-muslim communities ? 
   for some , sure , but for most of them it seems like it 's something they do with their friends growing up , and later it 's a fun day out where they go on the lash afterwards . 
  this fun day out is often a cause of tension/friction with the other community in north and has ( for centuries ) coincided with violence . 
  what 's interesting is that breitbart and the alt-right crowd were very supportive of brexit as they saw it as victory for the uk against globalism . 
  based on the comments of leading euroskeptics about post-brexit free trade deals , it seems to be the opposite . 
   but an attack on a place like notre dame could throw us in a very dark place . 
  we do n't have that much patience left . 
  the people behind these attacks seem determined to destroy the coexistence of people of different faiths and relations between them in france and other european countries . 
   but after we were told for years that there was no money to be spent on us , suddenly we can spend 100bn $ for our new `` citizens . '', 
  is the figure really that high ? 
  i feel sorry for germany . 
  not only could it have avoided the social problems that come with bringing huge numbers of people here , but they could have done it at a lower price too . 
  a euro towards helping the refugees goes much further in other parts of the world than here in europe . 
  this is why i think the term populist is justified in relation to parties like ukip . 
  they are happy to sit in opposition and give angry speeches about the establishment/how everything is a scandal . 
  i admit that these angry speeches are very successful in tapping into the anger against the establishment/political system . 
  but when it comes to actually proposing , challenging or amending legislation/policy ( what politicians are supposed to do ) they are conspicuously absent . 
  this is not just something that happens in the european parliament . 
  ukip 's only mp has a [ terrible voting record in westminster . 
  ] ( http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/mp.php?id=uk.org.publicwhip/member/40894&amp;showall=yes ), 
   `` when it comes to counter-terrorism and dealing with terrorism , it is that relationship that has helped to keep people on the streets of britain safe . '' for every time the saudis have passed on intelligence to britain/whoever , they have created many more salafists in the west and around the world whose ideology is a big threat to our societies . 
  it 's that ideology that has helped create islamic state and countless other jihadi groups . 
  then of course there is the fact that saudi arabia is actively funding [ jihadists linked to al qaeda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/army_of_conquest ) in syria . 
  if there is a lesson to be learnt from afghanistan , it 's that the funding of jihadists will come back to haunt the west in years to come . 
  what counts as games/entertainment in saudi arabia ? 
  i mean , it 's a country in which salafism/wahabbism is the official form of islam and shapes most aspects of everyday life . 
  this . 
  it 's a part of the left that values ideology above all , that ( in my experience ) is intensely fratricidal and loathes compromise . 
  such a commitment to ideology may be fine for backbenchers , but it 's fatal for the front bench which must lead/unite the party . 
  thanks for that . 
  i agree with you about solitary confinement but the european court of human rights would never allow that . 
  that really frustrates me in that these guys use their time in prison to radicalise others and yet their human rights are supposed to take precedence . 
  out of curiosity , does the law provide for any kind of monitoring for him when he gets out ? 
  i did n't know that was done in chile under pinochet . 
  i heard about it happening in argentina though during the * guerra sucia . 
  he would just continue radicalising young british muslims online via youtube/social media ( his account was never banned despite all the stuff he 's been up to ) and possibly even giving moral/physical support to attacks . 
  besides , i 'd rather he 'd be kept in prison rather than be allowed be a free man anywhere . 
  you 're onto something but i am fearful of where this line of thinking leads . 
  even marxists like zizek have highlighted that merkel 's invitation to the migrants last year had no democratic legitimization and was `` in effect imposing a gigantic change in a country 's status quo without democratic consultation of its population . '', 
  i have n't heard those exact words , but i have heard people arguing that they ca n't be racist because they belong to a minority group . 
  this was from one infamous case in the uk :  `` i , an ethnic minority woman , can not be racist or sexist to white men , because racism and sexism describes structures of privilege based on race . '', 
  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/05/13/bahar-mustafa-goldsmiths-cant-be-racist-sexist-woman_n_7272096.html ) so by her logic , minority groups can say whatever they like about people of other races , because by simply being from a minority group , they ca n't be racist . 
  they also argue that the climate crisis is a [ `` racist crisis '' ] ( https://twitter.com/ukblm/status/773058142133518336 ) so we should open borders and cut emissions . 
   `` extremism is on the rise everywhere , '' mr calvar said . 
  `` the ultra-right is looking forward to confrontation . 
  this confrontation , i think it will happen . 
  one or two more attacks and it will happen . '' mr. calvar is the head of domestic intelligence services in france . 
  i 've seen french redditors comment that this will result in a civil war or some other kind of civil conflict . 
  that is quite frightening and saddening at the same time . 
  the threat , both of conflict and of violence , is very real . 
  on the one hand , the threat of violence from jihadists is such that [ jews are under serious threat . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35445025 ) there has already been what has been referred to as an * internal aliyah * of [ jews moving away from arab/muslim neighborhoods for their safety . 
  ] ( https://medium.com/@b_judah/islam-and-the-french-republic-from-the-banlieus-to-le-pen-land-92d8a1fbf0e0#.fhepofh1c ) then there have been many mosques vandalised in reprisal for attacks and as calvar points out , this could result in much more violent attacks or all out conflict . 
  it really was heavily , heavily reliant on one man who has now left the stage . 
  that , the outcome of the referendum and first-past-the-post makes me think its appeal will wane now . 
  what are her other ideas that terrify you if i may ask ? 
  ok , thanks . 
  are you serious ? 
  this has nothing to do with race but with the fact that the values of many muslims are very different to those of the republic and completely incompatible with secularism ( like wanting to have sharia law ) . 
  pardon my ignorance , but what does that quote mean/imply ? 
  ** staunch secularist entrusted to quell france 's row over islam ** jean-pierre chev\u00e8nement says he will ` build an islam of france respectful of republican values ' * by : anne-sylvaine chassany in paris * compromise has never been jean-pierre chev\u00e8nement 's forte : over four decades in french politics he resigned from three different ministerial jobs after disagreeing with the government 's line .
