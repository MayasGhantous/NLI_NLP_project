  one or two more attacks and it will happen . '', 
  how much attention did his comments get ? 
  because that should be a headline in my opinion . 
  ** corsica clashes show the paranoia feeding ethnic tension ** notebook : no islamist link has been proved , but france feels under attack anne-sylvaine chassany august 4 , 2016 in the dead of august on a narrow rocky beach in northern corsica -- a spot that my cousin , my sister and i know well from our intense sunbathing years , but one that is not usually on tourists ' radar -- a group of maghrebi and local youths clashed . 
  i was in corsica when the events unfolded , and the brawl quickly became the main subject of conversation . 
  coming a month after the islamist terror attacks in nice and normandy , a collective hysteria ensued that exposed an unprecedented degree of fear and paranoia . 
  it also offered a glimpse of the ethnic tensions brewing in corsica , as probably it is doing in other corners of france in these unsettling times . 
  early reports were extraordinary and confused . 
  corse matin , the local daily newspaper , first said that 100 police officers had been dispatched to end the skirmishes , which were joined by dozens of inhabitants of the nearby village , sisco . 
  several cars were overturned and burnt . 
  a fire started in the hills nearby , about 15km north of bastia , the economic centre of the island . 
  five people were injured . 
  blame was quickly assigned . 
  a shaken teenager recounted how she and her friends had been attacked by muslim men armed with a machete and a harpoon and chanting `` allah akhbar '' and `` we 're going to kill you . '' one woman had gone swimming `` completely veiled '' , the girl was quoted by the newspaper as saying . 
  a rumour spread that a tourist had taken a photograph of the creek and of the burkini-clad woman , triggering an angry response from her male relatives . 
  the prosecutor vowed to identify the perpetrators and called for calm until this version of events could be checked . 
  sisco 's mayor nonetheless banned the burkini , joining a handful of other towns on the continent ( later followed by more ) . 
  the day after the incident , several hundred bastia residents staged a protest , demanding they be received by state authorities . 
  they then converged on an immigrant enclave of the town apparently in a belligerent spirit . 
  slogans such as `` arabi fora '' ( `` arabs out '' in corsican ) and `` we 're at home '' -- a chant frequently heard during rallies of the far-right national front -- could be heard sporadically , according to reports in corse matin . 
  eight months earlier there had been disturbances in which a squad of firefighters had been assaulted in the jardins de l\u2019empereur , the grandiose name ( referring to napoleon 's birth town ) given to a poor immigrant neighbourhood of ajaccio , the island 's administrative capital in the south . 
  a muslim prayer hall was subsequently ransacked . 
  but a few days after the latest brawl , police investigators offered a different scenario . 
  in this version , aggressive beachgoers ( of north african origin ) -- including one man known by the police for previous convictions -- wanted the beach for themselves and sought to keep others from using it , according to the prosecutor . 
  a fight ensued . 
  but there was no burkini . 
  the harpoon , a tool used by some to hunt fish along the coast , was not shot . 
  the machete was a knife , probably used to clean fish . 
  five people are to be tried in september -- two sisco residents and three men `` of maghrebi origin '' , the prosecutor said . 
  an islamist link has not been proved . 
  the number of police officers sent to end the clashes was closer to 50 than 100 . 
  a mediterranean tendency to exaggerate facts may have contributed to the affair being blown out of proportion . 
  a specific strand of nationalism rooted in the island 's history of invasions may also explain the reaction . 
  yet the incidents are significant for france in the light of warnings by the head of the domestic intelligence services in may , before the nice and normandy attacks . 
  in testimony to the senate , patrick calvar confirmed that france was a primary target of isis , the militant group that has claimed responsibility for the july assaults . 
  but he also highlighted the threat of ethnic clashes . 
  intelligence services were seeking to `` anticipate and stop all the groups that would want to trigger clashes between communities '' , he said . 
  `` extremism is on the rise everywhere , '' mr calvar said . 
  `` the ultra-right is looking forward to confrontation . 
  this confrontation , i think it will happen . 
  one or two more attacks and it will happen . '', 
  the foreign born population there is clearly integrating very well . 
  ** merkel 's refugee policy faces stern test in her home region ** german chancellor under pressure ahead of regional polls as immigration becomes ` issue number one . ' by : stefan wagstyl in neustrelitz angela merkel , germany 's chancellor , recently enjoyed a brief break from relentless questioning about her contentious refugee policy . 
  instead , europe 's most powerful leader was quizzed on traffic jams , theatre financing , and the wholesale price of false teeth at a gathering of business people in the rural region of mecklenburg-vorpommern , which is holding regional elections on september 4 . 
  for the 62-year-old chancellor , this sort of questioning at a campaign event was probably comforting : having represented the region 's stralsund constituency since german reunification in 1990 , she is familiar with its people and its problems . 
  `` this is her homeland , '' says martin koschkar , a political researcher at the university of rostock , mecklenburg-vorpommern 's largest city . 
  but the respite was short lived . 
  even though mecklenburg-vorpommern is far removed from the big cities where germany 's migrants are concentrated , ms merkel 's decision to take in more than 1m mainly muslim migrants since early 2015 is `` issue number one '' ahead of the regional elections , says lorenz caffier , the region 's interior minister and lead candidate for ms merkel 's cdu . 
  `` the question is asked on every street corner . '' it is also propelling the rise of the alternative for germany party , which is campaigning on an anti-immigration , anti-muslim , and anti-merkel platform . 
  opinion polls show the afd , which is running in mecklenburg-vorpommern for the first time , with 19 per cent support . 
  that is only a few percentage points short of the ruling social democrats ' 24 per cent and their cdu coalition partner 's 23 per cent . 
  a rural corner of the former communist east germany best known for its unspoilt lakes and beaches , mecklenburg-vorpommern is only slowly recovering from the economic shocks of german reunification . 
  until last year , depopulation was its biggest demographic concern . 
  but on its streets , the atmosphere has been transformed by the arrival of refugees . 
  christian butzki , deputy mayor of neustrelitz , the elegant tourist town where ms merkel was speaking , says there are no difficulties with asylum seekers settled locally . 
  `` but there is a general feeling of insecurity . 
  there is concern about possible cultural changes ... also some prejudiced people say , ` the refugees are only here for our money ' . '' the mood has been further charged by this summer 's two terror attacks , carried out by refugees linked to the militant group islamic state : an axe attack by an afghan teenager who wounded five people on a train ; and a suicide bombing by a 27-year-old syrian who blew himself up outside a wine bar , injuring 15 people . 
  a young german-iranian also killed himself and nine others in a mass shooting in munich . 
  although he had no islamist links , his rampage increased the sense of insecurity and , for some , feelings that people of foreign origin bring trouble . 
  `` the ratcatchers from the afd talk about refugees and crime , and people listen to them , '' says a warden working at the imposing 18th century church in neustrelitz 's cobbled market place . 
  ms merkel 's government has responded by pledging to boost police numbers and crack down on refugees suspected of terrorist sympathies . 
  her coalition government is also calling for a partial burka ban to encourage muslim integration . 
  but in mecklenburg-vorpommern , the government 's response has failed to calm worried voters who , like other residents of the former east germany , have been more open to the populist call of the afd than west germans . 
  ms merkel , who grew up close by in the brandenburg region , is trying to win them back with logic rather than rhetoric . 
  campaigning in the region , she admits that extremists are recruiting among refugees . 
  but she argues that islamist terrorism and immigration are separate issues : not least because germany itself produced homegrown terrorists who went to fight in the middle east . 
  but the afd is optimistic about its electoral chances . 
  it achieved its best regional result so far in march , in the eastern region of saxony anhalt , where it turned a 19 per cent opinion poll forecast into winning nearly a quarter of the votes on election day . 
  leif-erik holm , the afd 's lead candidate , is looking for similar late gains in mecklenburg-vorpommern . 
  a smooth-talking former radio disc jockey , the 46-year-old knows how to stir the crowd . 
  `` merkel must go , '' he says repeatedly on the stump . 
  in germany 's complex multi-party politics , matching saxony anhalt 's 24 per cent could put the afd in the top spot for the first time in a regional vote . 
  for established political leaders , the afd beating both the spd and the cdu , the two parties which have dominated german politics since the second world war , would be a political embarrassment . 
  for ms merkel , to see it happen in mecklenburg-vorpommern , where she has such deep roots , it would be a personal affront . 
  these are all admirable people who carried out huge acts of bravery . 
  however , on reading that i am left wishing that such acts of bravery were n't necessary and that france/europe/the world did not have to face the threat of islamic fundamentalism . 
  what a great idea . 
  your story more or less [ checks out , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emu_war ) although i had to google that as i could n't believe it . 
  was her heart problem undiagnosed or was it known that she had this problem ? 
  how was she the worst defence minister in your history ? 
  i remember watching a video once of a african-american muslim proselytising to people about how christianity he had been brought up in was the `` slavemaster 's religion . '', 
  i wonder what he would say if he was confronted with the fact that muhammad himself bought , sold and captured slaves . 
  for me both the ban and people 's reaction to it ( the panic buying the day before just because of * one * day without alcohol ) were ridiculous . 
  did n't joan mir\u00f3 design the logo for la caixa ? 
  either way , they are cool looking buildings , even if they remind me a little of tetris . 
  voters are in charge of what happens * when * they are offered a vote . 
  in the uk 's case , that 's not too often sadly ( i 'm referring to referenda ) . 
  in light of fptp , i 'd argue they are even more important . 
  ** erdogan battles to win kurdish hearts in turkey referendum ** * split vote could prove crucial in leader 's bid to cement grip on power * * 10 hours ago by : mehul srivastava in istanbul and laura pitel in diyarbakir * in turkish leader recep tayyip erdogan 's pursuit of an executive presidency via a referendum , the trickiest knot to unravel has been winning the support of the country 's kurds . 
  the kurdish vote has been historically split , with conservative kurds backing the ruling justice and development ( akp ) party 's islamist agenda while others support parties that offer a chance at greater autonomy . 
  and so , on saturday , the president showed up in diyarbakir , the unofficial capital of the kurdish minority , and a stronghold of the pro-kurdish people 's democratic party ( hdp ) , to ask for the kurds ' support ahead of the crucial april 16 vote on a new constitution . 
  `` just as we can not imagine turkey without istanbul , izmir , trabzon , antalya and erzurum , we can not imagine turkey without diyarbakir , '' mr erdogan told a crowd of 10,000 people hemmed in by tight security . 
  the visit came after a year in which the president sent troops into majority-kurdish cities to target kurdistan workers ' party ( pkk ) militants and used a state of emergency to decimate the hdp . 
  as he spoke , selahattin demirtas , the hdp 's leader , sat in jail , along with 12 of his most popular deputies . 
  the rally in diyarbakir illustrated how mr erdogan has sought to swing kurdish support in his favour by balancing the destruction of a popular political foe -- demirtas -- with the promise of prosperity and peace if they back him at the ballot box . 
  its success is the hinge upon which his referendum campaign rests -- an approach of `` just the right amount of compassion and the right amount of anger '' , says one of his aides . 
  `` mr erdogan could do this not because he is who he is , but because he had the entire state machinery at his disposal , '' says umit firat , a kurdish intellectual with ties to neither the akp nor the hdp . 
  `` but he also has to gain the hearts of the kurdish people of the region , and that is not easy . '' with polls suggesting the referendum is too close to call , the kurds -- who account for 15m of turkey 's 80m population -- could prove critical . 
  mr erdogan 's plans to crush the hdp started after the party 's strong showing in june 2015 elections when it won about 13 per cent of the vote , garnered 80 seats in parliament and became the president 's most stubborn opposition . 
  almost immediately , he stepped up a campaign to tie demirtas and his allies to the actions of the pkk , a designated terrorist group .
