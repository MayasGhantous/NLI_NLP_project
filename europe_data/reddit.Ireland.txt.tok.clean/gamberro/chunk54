  the university crackdown also echoes the closure of the european university in st petersburg in russia , which had its licence revoked this month . 
  the mayor of vilnius on wednesday invited the university to relocate in the lithuanian capital . 
  mr ignatieff would not be drawn on whether he would consider temporarily shifting some operations outside hungary . 
  `` we will never close this university and we will maintain our academic programmes no matter what , '' he said . 
  `` budapest is our home . '', 
  ireland and italy also have their own colours . 
  do n't you mean `` god '' ? 
  or perhaps he is married to a hungarian lady or something . 
  yes , i went out with a hungarian girl a few years ago who told me about the small communities of chinese and people from south east asia over there . 
  i even saw some when i was in budapest and was learning hungarian when i was with her . 
  your country is beautiful by the way . 
  out of curiosity , how much wine is consumed in turkey ? 
  i mean i assume it 's mostly consumed by secular turks as erdogan is opposed to the public consumption of alcohol , etc. 
  surely the akp supporters are n't that much in favor of it . 
  i 'm interested in reading more about turkey during wwii . 
  anybody have any links or recommend any books ? 
   `` the cell has been weakened , '' van ostayen said . 
  `` although i would say that some of its members are likely to still be in europe . '' this one may have been but the way things are going another one is likely to be created , unfortunately . 
  oh i know you 're not saying that . 
  i 'm just making fun of potus as he 'd probably come out with such nonsense if he the us had a french style system . 
  are these people paid to do this ? 
  these people seem to have a lot of time on their hands to harass people the akp does n't like . 
  that 's how it seems after seeing the hacking and other harassment . 
  it 's curious that we 'd share a map of the eu at its greatest extent while the frontpage of / r/europe is full of maps of empires at their height . 
  why ? 
  the peace process is not under threat because of martin mcguinness passing away . 
  his successor in n. ireland , michelle o'neill seems to want to continue with mcguinness ' approach since they went into powersharing of building bridges between the communities . 
  oh i know that . 
  they just happened to die a few years apart from one another and had a close relationship together towards the end ( the chuckle brothers ) . 
  it 's interesting to compare the conversation over on / r/ireland about [ mcguinness ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/60lypp/death_announced_of_martin_mcguinness/ ) compared to when [ ian paisley died ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/2g6xrz/ian_paisley_has_died/ ) back in 2014 . 
  interesting . 
  do you have more information about these events at the guardian ? 
  i 'd be interested in reading an article or two about how it got to the state it 's in . 
  that 's sorted for you now , lad . 
  ** wolfgang munchau : the eu and uk will do a deal ** it is in everybody 's best interests to avoid a ` hard brexit ' tue , oct 25 , 2016 , 14:01 updated : tue , oct 25 , 2016 , 14:02 wolfgang munchau the purpose of uk diplomacy in the next three years will be to remind the europeans that the brexit risks are more symmetrical than they think i would characterise the state of uk-eu relations as hopeless but not serious . 
  they are hopeless because of brexit . 
  the first european council meeting of prime minister theresa may was a frosty affair . 
  but the crisis is not serious because the divorce will be amicable . 
  there are two reasons why i believe this will be so . 
  the first is the national interest of the other 27 member states . 
  the second is that , while a `` hard brexit '' would hurt britain , it could also knock the euro zone back into crisis . 
  it would be a pointless double suicide . 
  of the two reasons , the first matters more in the beginning . 
  may said the article 50 negotiations for britain 's exit from the eu may take longer than the scheduled two years . 
  this suggests she plans to negotiate more than just boring technicalities . 
  ** feasible ** i would not be surprised if she and her ministers were planning to negotiate a free-trade agreement within that timeframe , in parallel with the article 50 negotiations . 
  i think such a strategy is feasible , contrary to the majority of commentators . 
  their argument is that trade negotiations between the eu and third countries normally last many years . 
  and it takes a few more years for those deals to be ratified . 
  just look at the comprehensive economic and trade agreement ( ceta ) between the eu and canada , which ran into trouble after the belgian region of wallonia voted against the deal . 
  in my view the ceta disaster can only mean that the british government would be ill-advised to follow the slippery route of a bilateral post-brexit trade deal . 
  the eu would not be able to conclude one . 
  from britain 's perspective it would , therefore , make more sense to fast-track a bilateral fta in order to circumvent national ratification processes -- which is technically possible -- and do this as soon as possible . 
  this will require that the eu co-operates . 
  will it ? 
  does the eu not want to punish the uk ? 
  ** unity ** up to now , the european council has maintained unity by rejecting suggestions of uk membership of the single market . 
  that is a sensible position after may said she would prioritise immigration controls . 
  i see no scope for compromise here . 
  but the european council will hardly be able to maintain unity behind a position that forces a nasty and sudden brexit . 
  the ogre of a hard brexit was the scare story of the remain campaign during the referendum , and the basis for numerous ludicrous economic projections . 
  it is not going to happen for the simple reason that national interests will intrude . 
  i was looking at uk-german trade data and found something that surprised me . 
  germany is not only exporting more goods to the uk , which we knew ; it also has a surplus in services , including finance , according to the federal statistics office . 
  uk services exports to germany were $ 24 billion in 2015 , while the uk imported services of $ 41 billion from germany . 
  if a hard brexit were to force the uk and the eu to impose quotas on traded goods and to suspend trade in most services , germany would be harder hit than the uk . 
  now , it is true the uk stands to lose more in total because it also trades with 26 other eu countries . 
  yet each eu country looks at its own position separately . 
  each has a vote in the european council . 
  ** interest ** the germans have an interest in maintaining free trade in both goods and services . 
  most other eu countries would come to a similar conclusion once they calculate the implications a hard brexit would have for them . 
  we just can not get around the fact that the uk had a current account deficit of more than 5 per cent of gross domestic product last year . 
  having an unsustainable external position is a rare benefit when you want to negotiate a trade deal . 
  it would be different if the eu had leaders who put the common interest before their own . 
  the euro zone crisis taught us they do not . 
  that is also true of angela merkel . 
  the german chancellor vetoed debt relief for greece , joint euro zone debt instruments and common deposit insurance for the euro zone . 
  she may pretend that she wants to be tough on britain but once german jobs are at risk i would expect her principled position to crumble . 
  if the brexit negotiations get stuck -- as they undoubtedly will at some point -- we may find that macroeconomic considerations become more important . 
  a hard brexit may knock a couple of percentage points off the uk 's gross domestic product but would presage a crisis in the eu . 
  the total effect on gdp in the euro zone would be smaller but the dynamics may be worse . 
  brexit , for example , would risk pushing italy into a recession , and that could trigger another financial crisis . 
  my conclusion is that both sides have an interest in a fair and square deal . 
  the purpose of uk diplomacy in the next three years will be to remind the europeans that the risks are more symmetrical than they think . 
  i think it 's important to point out that the borders of northern ireland were set to make the state there large enough to be viable ( by including areas such as tyrone/fermanagh that had a catholic/nationalist majority ) but also to ensure that protestants and unionists would be the majority by excluding the rest of the province of ulster , including counties donegal , cavan and monaghan . 
  that was part of the reasoning behind the boycott . 
   if you mean the us , under france 's system hillary indeed would have won . 
  the system is rigged !!!, 
  a couple of people in this thread have mentioned that the children responsible were from the roma/gypsy community . 
  is that true or has that been reported in the czech press ? 
  fair dues indeed . 
  although you can count ireland among the countries that vote on weekdays . 
  i voted before i went to work in our last election . 
  you 're right and that 's what people were saying over on / r/ireland . 
  it 'd be better to spend that money on * gaelscoileanna * or other efforts to promote the language , rather than on translating documents that few people will read . 
   what are people ` shocked ' about ? 
  that they gave these kids a proper burial ? 
  they buried these kids in unmarked graves and some were buried in what appears to have been a former septic tank . 
  where abouts in the country is this ? 
  is n't he worried that turkey ( or rather erdogan ) will turn on the flow of migrants again if we make an enemy out of him ?
