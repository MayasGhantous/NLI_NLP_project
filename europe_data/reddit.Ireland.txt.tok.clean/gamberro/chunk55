  i strongly disagree with what the user above said , but let me come in on one point . 
   we would be doing that regardless . 
  it 's the usa , we 've long had a special relationship with them . 
  long may it live . 
  that relationship has resulted in the uk participating in some pretty enormous disasters including the sanctions regime on iraq and the iraq war . 
  the latter was not even supported by the majority of the british public but the considerations of the special relationship took precedence . 
  i think it 's fair to say we are still facing the consequences of the iraq war today , which destabilised the entire region . 
  leaving aside whether you 're in the eu or not , i think you 'd be better served to move away from that special relationship . 
  are the descendants of the last sultan still around or something ? 
  do they really have unreasonable claims ? 
  i did n't say they were n't people and i am sorry if my comment came across that way . 
  i do n't know that much about him and had only heard about a comment he said about having fewer moroccans in the netherlands . 
  i just wanted some examples , nothing more . 
  can you give examples of how he dehumanises large groups of people ? 
  i am only aware of what he has said about moroccans . 
   and some bigger religions show clear signs of cultism , like mormonism . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  i ask because i do n't know a lot about mormonism . 
  so dutch does n't have any cases ? 
  interesting . 
  also they seem to have coloured in a large part of ireland where english is the main language that 's spoken , not irish . 
  thank you for your reply . 
  thank you for your reply . 
  i was in rotterdam a few months ago and it was my first time coming across people from there ( i did n't even recognise the flag when i came across surinamese shops ) . 
  out of curiosity , how well do the surinamese integrate in the netherlands ? 
  i ask because i know so little about the country but also because the dutch seem to have good statistics about these things . 
  what is it that is causing this ? 
  according to a quick google search , that 60 minutes crew were attacked in rinkeby ( the same place as in this article ) . 
  me too . 
  i loved that game . 
  we also have frontex providing a free ferry service across the mediterranean . 
  la ville rose . 
  i 've been there many times . 
  ** greece is as sick as ever and its agony goes on and on ** * medical metaphors are all too appropriate when summing up the years in the eurozone * 3 hours ago by : tony barber in may , greece will start its eighth year as a patient in the hospital for financially wounded eurozone countries . 
  having joined europe 's currency union in january 2001 , and having received the first of three rescues worth a combined $ 260bn in may 2010 , the country is on course for a fourth aid transfusion next year . 
  barring wholly improbable changes in the politics of european crisis management , greece will earn the unwanted distinction by late 2019 of having spent more of its eurozone existence in an intensive care unit than outside . 
  in an address on saturday to his ruling syriza party , alexis tsipras , prime minister , described greece as `` making sacrifices in the name of europe '' . 
  he spoke as if greece were some invalid suffering not for the sake of regaining his own health but to improve his doctors ' reputations . 
  these are the eurozone and international monetary fund consultants who bicker at greece 's bedside over what treatment to prescribe next . 
  the creditors will probably find a compromise between themselves and the patient will have little choice but to swallow their terms . 
  without such a deal , the combination of europe 's electoral calendar and greece 's debt repayment schedules would put the nation on life support systems by july . 
  two years after its appearance in the turbulent summer of 2015 , grexit , or greece 's exit from the eurozone , would re-emerge as a serious prospect . 
  this would be the most extreme surgery of all but it is far from unimaginable . 
  in assessing greece 's unhappy years in the eurozone , medical metaphors are all too appropriate . 
  for the fundamental question is whether , in their hearts , either eurozone governments or the imf or greece 's political leaders and citizens believe that seven years of expensive treatment have brought a cure even remotely within sight . 
  this question has three parts . 
  the first concerns the country 's ability to repay all its debt . 
  debt is the issue that most sharply divides eurozone creditors , especially germany and like-minded northern european allies , from the imf . 
  in its latest assessment , the fund states flatly that greece 's debt is `` unsustainable '' , predicting that on current trends it will explode to 275 per cent of annual economic output by 2060 from 180 per cent today . 
  substantial debt relief is essential , the imf concludes . 
  the fund does not propose explicit write-offs , known as `` haircuts '' , by greece 's official european creditors . 
  rather , the imf envisages a mixture of extended maturity and grace periods for the country 's repayments , plus very low fixed interest rates on its loans . 
  in this way the anticipated cycle of higher global interest rates would not overwhelm greece 's chances of recovery . 
  eurozone officials reject the imf 's diagnosis , suggesting somewhat airily that the world 's premier financial institution fails to understand the mechanics of eurozone rescue programmes . 
  privately , of course , all concerned know that the bloc 's resistance to debt relief is rooted in national and eu politics . 
  creditor governments fear a backlash against themselves , perhaps against the euro itself , if ever it dawned on voters that billions of euros supplied to athens had gone up in smoke . 
  the second part of the question relates to government budgets . 
  eurozone creditors contend that greece 's recent success in running a primary budget surplus -- that is , excluding interest payments -- shows that the public finances are getting stronger year by year . 
  consistent surpluses will keep the debt burden under control . 
  the imf is more pessimistic , perceiving a historical trend of greek political parties abandoning fiscal discipline and lavishing public money on favoured clients and powerful interest groups . 
  the third , arguably most important , part of the question is whether the eurozone-imf rescue programmes have helped to modernise the greek state . 
  all the creditors , and many of the country 's politicians , are doubtful . 
  tax collection rates have actually fallen since 2010 , despite efforts to strengthen the tax system . 
  `` the state of the [ public ] administration and of the health , education and justice systems is worse than at any time in the recent past , '' says yannos papantoniou , a former finance minister . 
  greece 's paralysis is set to continue as long as eurozone creditors refuse to grant athens extensive debt relief , yet refuse to bite a different bullet by letting it drop out of the currency union . 
  the lack of a decisive push in either direction creates just enough space for greece to do the minimal amount of reform required to keep aid flowing . 
  in this sorry state of affairs no one is a winner , and certainly not the greek people . 
  that 's editorialisation by the washington post , not me . 
  maybe oliver callan might do it . 
  we have n't gotten to ireland yet . 
  ** rift deepens between imf and eurozone over $ 86bn greek bailout ** * eurogroup finance chief criticises fund for gloomy view of athens growth * yesterday by : jim brunsden in brussels and shawn donnan in washington a split between the eu 's eurozone members and the imf over greece 's bailout deepened on tuesday as one of europe 's most senior policymakers and the athens finance minister criticised the fund for being too pessimistic about the country 's prospects . 
  jeroen dijsselbloem , president of the eurogroup of finance ministers , said in an interview with the netherlands ' rtlz that a bleak imf report on greece released on tuesday represented an `` outdated '' view of the greek economy and `` must be honest '' in its assessments . 
  hours later , euclid tsakalotos , greece 's finance minister , issued his own blunt assessment of the imf analysis , calling it `` misleading '' and based on `` overly-pessimistic assumptions '' . 
  `` all in all , '' he said in a statement accompanying the report , the imf 's recommendations and analysis `` are not in line with the most recent , evidence-based and pragmatic analysis of the greek economy '' . 
  the broadsides followed a rare public split at monday 's meeting in washington of the imf 's executive board over its latest assessment of the greek economy and prospects for greece 's $ 86bn bailout , aggravating concerns in the financial markets that the package could stall . 
  at the washington meeting , eu countries including france , germany , belgium , spain and sweden argued that imf projections of greece 's future growth were too pessimistic . 
  other non-european members , including the us , china , brazil , argentina , india and south africa defended the numbers . 
  the contretemps led to an unusual statement from the imf conceding that its board was split over its findings , which include that greece 's debts are unsustainable and on an `` explosive '' path to reaching almost three times its annual economic output by 2060 . 
  in a call with reporters on tuesday , poul thomsen , the head of the imf 's european department , defended the projections , saying the fiscal demands being placed on greece by its european creditors were too severe and would undermine the country 's fragile recovery . 
  the spat over the imf 's so-called article iv report , which was released publicly on tuesday , is the latest sign of the work that remains to be done if policymakers are to reach a deal that will bring in the imf as a full participant in the greek bailout programme , which was hammered out by eurozone leaders in 2015 . 
  the fund has so far provided technical support , without contributing financially . 
  full imf involvement is seen as key for maintaining already brittle support for the programme in some eurozone parliaments , notably the netherlands and germany . 
  diplomats warn that it may not be possible to secure the approval of national parliaments for further tranches of bailout aid until the impasse is resolved . 
  at the same time , in a year when german , french and dutch voters go to the polls , there are concerns that the political window for a deal may be closing . 
  in the interview , mr dijsselbloem , dutch finance minister , said he would `` like to have the imf on board but they must be honest '' . 
  he added : `` greece has already had four quarters of economic growth and has a pretty good recovery at the moment . '' the differing economic assessments have led to a stand-off over the steps needed in the next stages of the programme . 
  the imf is at loggerheads with berlin over the fund 's belief that primary budget surplus targets set for greece are profoundly unrealistic and that athens needs more substantial debt relief . 
  at the same time , the fund is banging heads with greece over its calls for athens to legislate now for policy measures that would be activated if it slips in meeting budget targets after 2018 . 
  the greek government said on tuesday that the country was `` seeking a socially viable agreement '' without accepting `` the imf 's absurd demands '' . 
  greek bonds came under heavy selling pressure on tuesday , with the country 's short-term yields climbing to 9.2 per cent , their highest level since september . 
  the yield on the 10-year bond rose 10 basis points to 7.5 per cent . 
  greece is due to pay nearly $ 7bn to its creditors in july . 
  it will not be able to meet these obligations without a fresh injection of bailout cash .
