  take somalia or afghanistan for instance . 
  we might be waiting a very long time for those countries to be stable in order for them to go home . 
   what 's even more sad is that first wave of north africa migrants ( mostly from algeria after the end of the colony ) did n't really care about religion : they ate porc , drink wine , woman 's hair were free etc. 
  they really wanted to integrate french/european culture . 
  i 've heard that as well . 
  what changed for the exact opposite to happen ?

  ** artur mas hopes trial will rouse catalan separatist movement ** * court appearance over non-binding poll could backfire on madrid * february 3 , 2017 by : tobias buck in barcelona the criminal trial that artur mas faces on monday could mean a 10-year ban from public office . 
  but the former president of catalonia hopes his prosecution will also be a rallying cry for the cause of independence from spain . 
  three years ago , mr mas 's catalan government organised an informal referendum to demand independence for one of the country 's largest and most prosperous regions . 
  the non-binding poll was opposed by the spanish government and went ahead in defiance of an order from spain 's constitutional court -- leading to the trial that mr mas will face next week on charges of contempt of court and breach of trust . 
  amid a surge in separatist sentiment in catalonia , with mass demonstrations in favour of secession and an openly pro-independence government , mr mas believes his trial 's significance extends beyond the barcelona courtroom . 
  it offers the catalan independence movement a chance to galvanize public opinion -- and mr mas is looking forward to his day in court with relish . 
  `` for us personally this is not a gift . 
  this can halt our political careers for several years , '' he says in an interview ahead of the hearing . 
  `` but for the project -- the creation of a sovereign state -- this is positive because it mobilises people . 
  it mobilises even people who are not in favour of independence . 
  `` this is a political trial that has very little foundation in law , '' mr mas says . 
  `` that is what we will tell the court . 
  and we will say that we are convinced that no crime was committed -- and that we are willing to take this case all the way to the european court in strasbourg . '' the prosecution of mr mas and two other senior government officials comes at a moment of heightened tensions between spain and catalonia . 
  carles puigdemont , the catalan president who replaced mr mas last year , has vowed to hold another independence referendum in september -- but says this time the ballot will be legally binding . 
  madrid is opposed to any plebiscite , and will probably win backing once again from the spanish courts to outlaw any new vote . 
  according to mr mas , it is not just the three defendants who are on trial but also the spanish state . 
  he accuses madrid of meddling in the case and of using a `` politicised '' judicial system to inflict punishment on catalan independence leaders , saying : `` i know of no other democratically elected president who has been put on trial simply for allowing people to vote . '' spanish leaders have repeatedly rejected accusations of interference , and insist that mr mas is being prosecuted like any other citizen . 
  mariano rajoy , the spanish prime minister , says he is ready to talk to the catalan government about a new system of regional finances and other practical concerns -- but not about independence . 
  in the view of the government and the judiciary , spain 's constitution leaves no room for catalan self-determination , let alone for independence and statehood . 
  the poll that is at the centre of mr mas 's trial was eventually held in november 2014 , but was widely boycotted by catalan voters who oppose independence . 
  out of 5.4 m eligible voters in the region , 2.3 m took part -- with 80 per cent casting their ballot in favour of an independent state of catalonia . 
  mr mas said he would accept the ruling of the court but would appeal any guilty verdict . 
  he also said he felt bound by the court 's decision only `` as long as we are under spanish jurisdiction '' . 
  `` if catalonia has sufficient strength to change the status quo and to build a [ separate ] state , this would change radically , '' he says . 
  ** uk abortion clinics to turn away irish women ** * ben gurr / the times * britain 's biggest abortion provider has announced that it will begin turning irish women away from its clinics , blaming overwhelming demand for its services . 
  a spokeswoman for marie stopes international warned that it would prioritise clients referred by the british national health service , although irish women who had already booked appointments would be treated . 
  the organisation said it would refer irish clients to the british pregnancy advisory service ( bpas ) , which also offers terminations . 
  a spokeswoman for the bpas warned that its services were also under strain . 
  `` we 're looking at our capacity across the country . 
  irish women may have to go to slightly different locations to access our services , '' she said . 
  women from ireland and northern ireland who need of a termination can travel to britain to pay privately for the procedure , which is illegal in almost all cases across the island of ireland . 
  a marie stopes spokeswoman said that the measures were a suspension rather than a permanent ban . 
  `` january and february are always the busiest times of year and we are currently managing high demand by referring some women to other providers to ensure they can be seen as soon as possible , '' the spokeswoman said . 
  `` our priority is ensuring women obtain the earliest possible appointment and we are working with organisations in ireland to ensure provision is there for women who go via their networks . 
  `` we are managing demand by focusing on nhs clients but our helpline is very clear to everyone that calls that if they have difficulty finding another provider they should call us back . '' the abortion rights campaign ( arc ) said the irish government should not rely on a british system , `` which it appears can no longer support the 11 women a day who travel from ireland . 
  `` instances like these serve as a reminder that the irish government has abdicated its responsibility to women and pregnant people in ireland , '' linda kavanagh , a spokeswoman for arc , said . 
  abortion is only available in ireland in cases where the woman 's life is at risk . 
  this includes cases where the woman is suicidal , but only if she can prove it to a panel of medical experts.the citizens ' assembly , set up by enda kenny after calls to liberalise irish law , is considering whether the government should hold a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment . 
  yesterday , the assembly heard that legal and medical professionals were powerless to stop women taking abortion pills bought online . 
  many women who can not afford to travel purchase mifepristone and misoprostol , pills that induce miscarriage , on the internet . 
  gerard bury , a professor of general practice at university college dublin school of medicine , said he was `` increasingly impressed by people 's ability to make their own decisions . 
  `` the technological and medical advances and the mail systems mean that people make decisions that are entirely outside the healthcare system at the moment at many levels -- whether it 's steroids to build up your muscles or whether it is misoprostol to end a pregnancy , '' he said . 
  `` those decisions are being made by people on a practical day-to-day basis . 
  neither the law , nor the constitution , nor the guidance to the medical profession supports those routes . 
  to the extent that they are utterly unregulated , and at a very practical level , they have their potential harms that perhaps we need to better empower people to address . '' he said women should not be afraid to seek medical guidance in cases where they felt taking the pills had gone wrong . 
  the assembly 's weekend session was the third meeting of five on the issue of abortion . 
  at its next meeting in march the assembly will hear testimony from women in ireland who have undergone abortion . 
  it will also invite several advocacy groups from both sides of the debate to address the forum , requesting them to propose solutions to the assembly instead of merely arguments . 
  groups will be selected from 115 organisations that have campaigned on the issue . 
  yesterday , some members suggested excluding religious organisations from the process on the grounds that spokespeople from all religions would have to be invited . 
  others suggested that excluding groups such as the catholic church would be unfair . 
  on saturday the members examined a random selection of submissions the assembly had received . 
  several expressed frustration at the amount from religious organisations . 
  they said that many of the proposals offered `` no workable solutions '' , and instead only included ideological statements such as `` thou shalt not kill . '' others said that many submissions from men had been largely unsympathetic to women who found themselves in crisis pregnancy situations .

  ** the voices of france 's jihadist foot soldiers ** * a journalist listens to veterans of the holy war in the middle east * 9 hours ago by : review by jonathan derbyshire no western country , the french journalist david thomson observes in his new book , has suffered more in recent years at the hands of jihadi terrorists than france . 
  since 2012 , when mohammed merah , a petty criminal of algerian descent , killed seven people , including three children at a jewish school in toulouse , there has been a string of outrages committed by jihadis , culminating in the slaughter in paris on november 13 2015 and the motorised massacre on the seafront at nice in july last year . 
  the agonised national conversation that swells in the wake of each attack has tended to focus on two questions . 
  first , why , exactly , has france become the preferred target of violent islamism ? 
  and second , what connection , if any , is there between the texts of the islamic tradition and jihadi `` propaganda of the deed '' ? 
  this debate , especially where the second question is concerned , has been shaped in large part by two prominent french scholars : the arabist gilles kepel and the political scientist olivier roy . 
  for roy , there is nothing distinctively `` islamic '' about this epidemic of violence . 
  `` it is not a question of the radicalisation of islam , '' he has written , `` but of the islamisation of radicalism . '' the religious dimension of the phenomenon is secondary , he argues , to what he describes as a `` generational revolt '' . 
  in his book le djihad et la mort ( `` jihad and death '' ) , published in the autumn , shortly before thomson 's , roy sees the jihadis ' fascination with death as rooted not in theology but in a species of `` nihilism '' . 
  kepel rejects this analysis , stressing the influence on groups such as isis , al-qaeda and their foot soldiers in france , of the salafist strain of sunni islamic theology . 
  his objection to roy is also methodological : it helps , he thinks , actually to listen to what the jihadis themselves say about their actions and beliefs , and to take them at their word . 
  this is exactly what thomson does to thrilling effect in les revenants ( `` the returned '' ) , which must be counted as a major contribution to the debate hitherto dominated by kepel and roy . 
  the book is the fruit of interviews thomson conducted between 2014 and 2016 with french jihadis at home , in prison and on the phone from syria and iraq . 
  his subjects include yassin , the son of two doctors who went to fight with isis in 2014 , and kevin , a muslim convert who spent four years in the middle east before deciding to leave when the jihadis ' military position began to look precarious . 
  as thomson points out , yassin 's case -- he was a good student from a stable and well-off family -- does not fit the `` immigration-delinquency-banlieue equation '' that underpins much of the official response to the terrorist threat , particularly the `` deradicalisation '' programmes that those returning from syria are expected to go through . 
  zoubeir , one of thomson 's most eloquent interlocutors , is dismissive of the assumptions that underlie such programmes , not least the belief that jihad has `` nothing to do with islam '' . 
  it has `` everything to do with islam '' , he says . 
  the testimony thomson has gathered would seem to support kepel 's view rather than roy 's . 
  like the former , he stresses the role that salafist theology plays in leading young french muslims towards jihad . 
  and unlike the latter , he detects a utopian , as opposed to nihilistic , dimension in the appeal that isis holds . 
  to the children of immigrants from the maghreb , the caliphate headquartered in raqqa promises a dignity and status they do not enjoy at home . 
  as another of thomson 's subjects says , the folk memory of the depredations of french colonialism in north africa runs deep : `` that is why france is one of the [ jihadis ' ] main targets . '' the women thomson interviews are as virulent in their loathing of the french state and all its works as their male comrades . 
  one of them , lena , describes the slaughter of several members of the editorial team of charlie hebdo in january 2015 as `` one of the most beautiful days of my life '' . 
  these young people might have returned from syria but they are not at all repentant .

  do you really think it 's almost certain that the result would be `` no '' ? 
  the opinion polls seem to suggest that at times , but almost every catalan supporter of independence that i have met has been adamant that it would be a victory for `` yes . '', 
  ** germany 's exporters fear trump effect on trade ** worries over us protectionism have already affected confidence * 3 hours ago by : claire jones in windach , bavaria * deep in the bavarian countryside the modern factory buildings of delo , a company of little more than 500 people , supply the glue and technology that binds around half of all the world 's mobile phones . 
  like many other small and medium-sized companies in germany 's heartlands -- known as the mittelstand -- delo provides parts and technical expertise that help make products consumed across the world . 
  like them , it is increasingly alarmed that its business model will come unstuck because of donald trump 's break with decades of us trade policy . 
  `` we 've invested a lot into the us and it would be a pity if some protectionism did come up , '' said robert saller , managing director , referring to fears that the us president could increase trade barriers and jettison trade talks . 
  other groups also express worries that mr trump will seek to reduce german sales into the us market . 
  `` we 're concerned a lot about trump 's policy of protectionism , '' said manfred ritz , a spokesman for the vci , a trade body that represents almost 1,700 companies in the chemicals industry . 
  `` we need open markets . 
  our business model in germany is exports . '' such anxieties have broader consequences for europe as a whole . 
  germany is the eurozone 's economic motor and with growth still weak in france and non-existent in italy , europe can ill afford it to decelerate . 
  trade is the backbone of the country 's economy : exports were worth $ 1.19 tn in 2015 , more than a third of gross domestic product .
