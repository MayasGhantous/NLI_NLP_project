  many people on the far-right or the alt-right come out with comments like the one above every time they feel we are regressing in europe . 
  yet at the same time they point to russia as an alternative model to follow . 
  jeez , i did n't know state owned media in turkey was that bad . 
  it seems bizarre g\u00fclen is portrayed as being behind everything bad that happens . 
  dude , i 'm not a supporter of the alt-right and do n't believe in the swedistan stuff . 
  but i do believe that sweden has created serious social problems for itself by its open door approach to migration that it could have otherwise avoided . 
  many of the people do not share swedish values at all , do not bring key skills to its economy and rely heavily on its welfare state . 
  swedistan may be alt-right bullshit but i think there are perfectly valid reasons to be concerned . 
  when you get your news from infowars or breitbart , while at the same time believe that the mainstream media is heavily biased or lying , you are going to be seriously misinformed . 
  i 'm curious . 
  does the far-right in france use terms like `` globalism '' and `` globalists '' like in the us and other places ? 
  doing the `` right '' thing may be subjective . 
  but in that case i think the next best option is to do the democratic thing and respect the outcome of the referendum . 
  i ca n't see how ignoring the result ( as you suggest ) is democratic . 
  he does love the media and he is great for ratings . 
  but i really do n't see how he would be a good diplomat/negotiator . 
  for one thing his expertise is in giving angry speeches and tapping into the anger against the establishment , none of which would help in a diplomatic role where you are supposed to represent the government of your country . 
  ** italy tightens rules on migrant repatriation after mass arrivals ** * yesterday by : davide ghiglione in rome * italy is to step up measures to repatriate migrants who have no right to stay in the country , in a sign of the pressure facing authorities after an influx of people crossing the mediterranean to reach europe . 
  the country 's chief of police has asked officers nationwide to step up efforts to identify and repatriate migrants who are not entitled to asylum , while italy will also open new identification centres to hold people before their expulsion . 
  the tougher migrant stance marks the first significant policy change under paolo gentiloni , the new prime minister , who took over after matteo renzi stepped down in december following his bruising defeat over a referendum on constitutional reform . 
  it also comes days after the man suspected of a terror attack on a berlin christmas market was shot dead by police near milan . 
  anis amri , a tunisian national , spent several years in italy , where he was in prison , before moving to germany , where he was refused asylum . 
  authorities there tried to deport him but tunisia refused to recognise him as its citizen . 
  in a directive to officers franco gabrielli , italy 's police chief , said local officers should take `` extraordinary action '' to control and remove irregular migrants . 
  he said italy faced an `` international context marked by instability and threats '' . 
  according to the italian interior ministry , more than 180,000 migrants arrived by sea in 2016 , exceeding 2015 's tally of 153,000 and passing the record number of almost 170,000 people in 2014 . 
  an italian official told the financial times that the instructions were the first step to start a process to `` strengthen italy 's strategies to deal with the migrant crisis , which needs to be addressed in a detailed way on the ground '' . 
  another official said the interior ministry planned to open several new `` identification and expulsion centres '' . 
  four such centres are already operating but only have capacity for 360 people . 
  while the aim would be to have one such centre in each italian region , these could still handle only a small portion of the migrants estimated to live in italy with no authorisation . 
  according to eurostat , the eu 's statistics agency , in 2015 fewer than 5,000 migrants were repatriated among more than 27,000 expulsion orders handed out in italy . 
  `` it 's a process that has to be undertaken locally , to make it easier to identify and remove economic migrants not entitled to asylum , '' the ministry source said . 
  `` so far italy has been overwhelmed and we managed to repatriate only a few migrants compared to the total amount , and it has often been very complex . '' mr renzi refused to create detention centres for humanitarian reasons , although he did agree to the setting up of centres to identify and process migrants . 
  in a new year 's address sergio mattarella , italy 's president , called for firmness to be combined with a welcoming approach on migration . 
  `` it would be a big mistake to underestimate the anxieties spread in our society . 
  after the explosion of international terrorism of islamic origin , the presence of many migrants in our country has increasingly created a sense of insecurity , '' mr mattarella said . 
  `` the correlation between immigrant and terrorist is unjust and unacceptable , '' the president added , `` but all the efforts and the security measures have to be put in place in order to avoid , in our country , the radicalisation of threatening figures and preachers of death . '', 
  i agree . 
  i also have n't seen 56-60 % support for independence in the past like the user above claims . 
  i said this last year after new years eve but i will say it again , there is a ** big ** problem with juvenile delinquency ( not a pc term but i do n't care ) among 2nd/3rd generation immigrants from the maghreb . 
  that 's the conclusion i 've come to after seeing incidents like this , including at the lawlessness , arson , physically attacking the emergency services and vandalism in the french banlieues ( and elsewhere ) . 
  i 'm not sure what the solution is to this problem , but recognising that it exists is a first step . 
  the data in the graph appears to come from december '16 ( last month ) . 
  how is that outdated ? 
  regardless , the margin is very narrow and the question has to be put to a vote or votes in my opinion . 
  holding several votes ( like you are proposing ) would be easier to achieve if the spanish government had participated in this process from the beginning , rather than trying to shut it down . 
  since it has been ( and continues to be ) difficult to hold just * one * legally binding vote on independence , i 'm not surprised thst puigdemont wants to make it the difinitive vote on independence and is not interested in holding several votes . 
  however , maybe puigdemont 's attitude will change if the spanish government decides to change its approach and allow a binding vote/votes . 
  so you 're saying pujol is presented as a supposed boogeyman who is secretly behind the independence movement ? 
  by the way , your english is better than mine lad . 
  [ you 're more or less correct . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/secession_in_the_united_states ), 
  a legally binding vote on independence is supported by the podemos formation in the spanish congress ( currently the second most popular ) , but not by the other formations like the pp , psoe or ciudadanos . 
  whether you agree with their positions on other things or not , the podemos party seem to be the only ones talking sense on this issue in my opinion . 
  there has been much talk of a spanish wide referendum on catalonia 's independence , much to the frustration of the catalans ( in my opinion ) . 
  did the rest of the uk vote on scottish independence or its right to hold such a vote ? 
  did the rest of canada vote on quebec 's independence ? 
  what does jordi pujol have to do with this ? 
  your post is a more or less accurate description of the way this has played out for the last few years . 
  ** but ** something has to give in my opinion . 
  i ca n't see this muddling through for many more years . 
  there needs to be a legally binding vote ( as you say ) . 
  this guy was arrested for refusing to show up to court , not for refusing to testify . 
  in my country , you can be arrested for ignoring a court summons . 
  you have no legal right not to do so . 
  the article makes it seem that being arrested for ignoring a court summons is a francoist/fascist idea . 
  ok , i was n't aware . 
  thanks for letting me know . 
  many thanks . 
  thanks for that . 
  thanks . 
  quick question for you , since you guys were annexed as part of the soviet union , did you have to do military service as well ? 
  did units from the baltic countries go fight for the ussr in places like afghanistan ? 
  pardon my ignorance but when we 're those photos taken and what were those demonstrations about ? 
  why is this problem significantly worse in belgium than in the netherlands ? 
  out of curiosity , have the saudis been funding wahabbism/salafism in albania too ? 
  in addition to kosovo , i understand they are doing similar kinds of stuff in bosnia . 
  yes they exist but they do but they 're not that common either . 
  in addition to different belief systems , buddhists do n't have the same feelings about belonging to a global community , * ummah , * tribe or transnational body that we get with islam . 
  do we or did we have the same problems with religious fundamentalism from buddhists after millions were killed in south east asia by the americans/their allies ? 
  how many american buddhists killed civilians in the west in reprisal for killings of their coreligionists in the other side of the world ? 
  not entirely related but there have been calls for serious academic research into this area after cases of grooming gangs in the u.k.  the report also called for research into why a significant number of perpetrators of child grooming came from muslim backgrounds .

  i really admire maajid nawaz and the quilliam foundation but what evidence is there for its `` fantastic track record in this regard ? '', 
  nawaz appears to attract hostility from even moderate muslims like mehdi hassan and many others see him as a british government stooge . 
  i have syrian friends here in ireland ( they have been here for a long time and are not refugees ) who went back to visit their family in damascus a few months ago . 
  then there are also cases of asylum seekers in europe going on holiday to the country [ they have supposedly fled from . ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/52n27y/investigation_reveals_registered_asylum_seekers/ ? ), 
  a lot of reddit is like that and / r/ireland is similar in terms of a very young demographic with views not representative of the rest of society . 
  there is no war or genocide in western turkey , which is where the boats in greece are departing from . 
  yes , many of the migrants come from countries torn apart by conflict , but in arriving in greece/europe they are not fleeing for their lives but crossing from one safe country to another in search of a better life . 
  i think emotions got caught up in seeing images of people arriving and hindered us from taking in the big picture . 
  i do n't see why we could n't have humanely returned these people to turkey at the beginning of the migrant crisis ( something along the lines of what we are doing now ) . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  i do n't understand what you 're talking about . 
  do you have a link about them bothering or attacking people ? 
  better or worse than mahou ? 
  do you have a link to that ? 
  you 're grand . 
  no worries at all .
