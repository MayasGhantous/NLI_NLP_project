  sorry about that . 
  the site must have changed the title .

  ** swiss and danish travails show way ahead for brexit talks ** * creative solutions are possible but eu refuses to compromise on legal principles * december 16 , 2016 7:20 pm by alex barker and duncan robinson in brussels and ralph atkins in zurich brexit negotiators banking on the legendary creativity of eu lawyers will be both encouraged and somewhat alarmed this week by the referendum-related travails of denmark and switzerland . 
  although their situations are all different , copenhagen and bern were dropped in a similar political hole after losing eu-related plebiscites . 
  both needed to assert sovereignty against brussels while preserving the benefits of eu co-operation . 
  their brussels-compliant fixes , which emerged this week after long and bruising negotiations , offer valuable potential insights for britain as it attempts to build ties while striking out against the union 's founding principles , be it over free movement of labour or a common court . 
  diplomats and analysts say the lesson is that while creative , transitional legal solutions are possible , they are tightly bound within core eu law . 
  these were conditions that brussels refused to compromise on for denmark and switzerland , not least because it saw brexit talks on the horizon . 
  in the case of switzerland 's demands for quantitative caps on eu migration it made a solution all but impossible , forcing the swiss to effectively capitulate to brussels to preserve the constrained single market access it enjoys as a non-eu member . 
  `` watch out , london ! '' joked one senior eu diplomat involved in brexit preparations . 
  for denmark , an eu member that in december 2015 rejected deeper justice co-operation , the question was how to retain the benefits of the europol police co-operation network after being forced to leave it as a member . 
  lars loekke rasmussen , the danish premier , compared it to throwing away the front door keys to europol and working to `` find a way in through the back door '' the part-fix unveiled on thursday involved legal wizardry and an eccentric practical trick . 
  where database access was once automatic , denmark would in future pay for eight danish speakers to sit in the europol offices in the netherlands . 
  they would field calls for database searches -- and duly pass them to a europol staffer next to them authorised to do the search . 
  `` it is very odd , '' said bjarke m\u00f8ller of the europa think-tank in london . 
  `` but we are the odd man in the eu . 
  it is a particularly danish thing . '' the hitch for london is the underlying conditions to allow this arm 's - length relationship . 
  denmark had to remain part of the schengen passport-free travel area , heed all applicable eu data protection laws , pay europol budget contributions , lose any oversight of the agency and -- most important for london -- be overseen by eu courts . 
  the europol solution is imperfect , probably temporary , and unable to keep pace with technological changes , such as danish police wanting to check databases from handheld devices . 
  but poul skytte christoffersen , denmark 's former ambassador to the eu , if there are any lessons for brexit , it is in designing transitional measures . 
  `` it is not a long-term solution , but it helped avoid a cliff edge , '' he said . 
  these conditions underline how difficult it may be for london . 
  `` the danish deal is not a model for the brits , '' said camino mortera-martinez , an expert on eu justice and home affairs policy at the centre for european reform think-tank . 
  theresa may , britain 's prime minister , has made clear she wants to leave the jurisdiction of europe 's top court -- a position that will loom over almost all areas of justice and home affairs policy . 
  `` it is overseen by the european court of justice in every single bit , '' said ms mortera-martinez . 
  switzerland was less successful in finding even a halfway solution to its three-year old referendum-born dilemma : the need for quotas on the inflows of eu migrants . 
  the swiss voted to abandon that plan on friday in favour of a softer variant after the eu refused to compromise and warned quotas would violate bilateral agreements and damage trade relations . 
  the principles at stake for brussels , in other words , were too great for even the legal wizards to work around . 
  `` it was pretty clear they did n't want to talk about it , [ the swiss problem ] and they did n't really talk about it , '' said patrick emmenegger , politics professor at the university of st gallen . 
  `` we wanted to negotiate and had ideas about what we could negotiate , but we got the feedback that there was nothing to negotiate . '' faced with little access or engagement from the eu 's top leadership , the swiss were left with no choice but to devise their own legal solution , obliging swiss employers to make more effort in certain circumstances to find swiss staff . 
  the swiss know that britain 's negotiating clout is greater , and that their problem was compounded by the looming brexit talks . 
  but alexis lautenberg , a former swiss ambassador to the uk , said there are interesting parallels to note as britain manages a trade-off between greater control over immigration and future access to eu markets . 
  `` the uk is trying to see where the trade-off could be , '' he said . 
  `` some of the experiences of the swiss might help the uk to find a bespoke solution . '', 
  very interesting . 
  thanks . 
  as disgusting as it sounds , that is what he reportedly told police . 
  in addition to not keeping out migrants travelling on fake papers , many of the migrants are also arriving here with * no * papers whatsoever , having destroyed them en route to europe . 
  that makes it incredibly difficult for the authorities to process them . 
  a far more reasonable measure in my opinion would be for the authorities to control the borders and not let anybody in who does n't have official documents . 
  ** uk and germany face eu action on ` dieselgate ' ** * brussels frustrated by failure to crack down on emissions test cheating * yesterday by : jim brunsden in brussels and peter campbell in london the european commission is set to start legal action against countries including germany and the uk for failing to clamp down on the emissions cheating exposed by the `` dieselgate '' scandal . 
  the move reflects mounting frustration in brussels over how national authorities have responded to the widening scandal , which began with revelations last year that german carmaker volkswagen had used software , known as defeat devices , to cheat tests for dangerous nitrogen oxides ( nox ) that cause respiratory diseases and lung cancer . 
  according to people briefed on the matter , the commission will start `` infringement proceedings '' against as many as seven nations for either not acting on evidence uncovered by their investigations into dieselgate , or , in some cases , for failure to bring in laws punishing environmental breaches . 
  brussels will argue that these shortcomings violate eu law dating back to 2007 . 
  national watchdogs and transport ministries are responsible for policing manufacturers to make sure they do not violate the eu 's ban on defeat devices . 
  since the vw revelations , it has emerged that other manufacturers have also used sophisticated , software-based techniques so their cars pass official tests despite emitting far higher levels of nox on the road . 
  the practices include switching off emissions control systems outside of narrow temperature ranges , or after a period of time just longer than the tests . 
  the manufacturers , which include daimler 's mercedes-benz , general motors ' opel and fiat , have insisted that such practices are necessary to protect car engines and are therefore legal . 
  the `` letters of formal notice '' that will be sent by the commission mark the first stage of its standard procedure for sanctioning nations that fail to uphold eu law . 
  brussels can escalate the matter to the european courts if governments fail to address its concerns . 
  el\u017cbieta bie\u0144kowska , the eu 's industry commissioner , has repeatedly expressed frustration at complaints from germany that eu law is unclear on what kinds of practices are banned , making it hard to inflict sanctions on vw or other manufacturers . 
  the commission insists the `` letter and the spirit '' of the eu rules are clear . 
  ms bie\u0144kowska has also urged british and german authorities to follow up on findings they presented in april on how different manufacturers switch off emissions control technology -- saying that regulators and carmakers have not convincingly explained why they think such practices are in line with eu law . 
  the commissioner refused to confirm whether the eu would go ahead with infringement proceedings . 
  however she told the financial times that she had `` grown increasingly frustrated with member states ' lack of co-operation '' . 
  governments `` need to prevent , police and sanction any cheating by car manufacturers , '' she said . 
  the scandal showed a need `` to change the whole system '' of environmental regulation of cars , ms bie\u0144kowska said . 
  according to the people briefed on the matter , thursday 's infringement proceedings will also cover cases where governments have failed to act on eu rules requiring them to have `` effective , proportionate and dissuasive '' penalties to punish illegal use of defeat devices . 
  the commission asked a number of governments this year to clarify that they had taken this step but has not revealed the responses . 
  failure to put sanctions in place would in effect leave manufacturers free to violate the ban on defeat devices with impunity . 
  brussels has already been angered by moves by some national transport ministries to water down a draft law to overhaul how europe oversees environmental testing of the car industry . 
  plans it presented in january included more powers for national authorities to check each other 's work ; the power for the commission to carry out vehicle spot checks ; and moves to tackle conflicts of interest in how test centres get paid . 
  greg archer , clean vehicles director of environmental group transport & environment , said infringement proceedings would be a wake-up call to national governments . 
  `` toothless paper-tiger regulators must now do their job and put the health of citizens above that of engines , '' he said . 
  do we have this problem with violent religious fundamentalism/intolerance working class christians , hindus , sikhs and buddhists ? 
  many of those are also of an immigrant background or a racial minority in europe , yet they do not have the same problem . 
   democrats win the minorities by large margins , but always lose anyway . 
  democrats have won in recent years including the popular vote in the latest election . 
  no , it 's not an actual question . 
  i meant that i agreed with the user above that he was most likely trying to smuggle illegals through the schengen border . 
  i really do n't see how this monetary union can work without a a fiscal one . 
  if you guys really are n't interested in such a union , i guess we should brace ourselves for southern europe to crash out of the eurozone . 
  i was wondering about the fact that he had a cypriot passport/residence permit . 
  why on earth was he at the hungarian border trying to force his way through if he already had a way into europe ? 
  are those subs really that bad ? 
  honest question as i do n't know . 
  i 've seen comments complaining that / r/ukpolitics has a lot of left-wing cyclejerk . 
  ** germany braces for trump 's trade policies ** * germany 's formidable exporters assess dangers of u.s. protectionism -- but also new opportunities * by natascha divac and sarah sloat nov. 27 , 2016 7:00 a.m. 
  et frankfurt -- donald trump 's victory in the u.s. presidential election , after a campaign attacking free trade , has companies in europe 's biggest exporting nation scrambling to tally up the impact . 
  germany shipped $ 125 billion in goods to the u.s. last year , 2.5 times what it imported from the u.s. , according to the u.s. census bureau . 
  the u.s. is germany 's largest trading partner , accounting for almost 10 % of all german exports , according to germany 's state statistical office . 
  `` if trump can enact the trade limits he has announced , the damage would be substantial , '' said clemens fuest , president of germany 's ifo institute for economic research . 
  he estimates 1.5 million german jobs depend on exports to the u.s. germany 's economics ministry , in an internal assessment of mr. trump 's economic platform compiled before the election , warned he could isolate the u.s. from global economic activity , removing a massive source of demand for german exports . 
  the study , first reported by news weekly der spiegel , was confirmed by a german official , who noted that many campaign proposals may not become policy . 
  germany also may have some security because its companies are big players in the u.s. domestic economy . 
  german direct investment into the u.s. totaled $ 47 billion in 2015 , according to the u.s. commerce department . 
  the 50 largest u.s. affiliates of german companies employ nearly 750,000 american workers , according to the german american chamber of commerce . 
  aside from german icons such as bmw ag and siemens ag , brands including dhl express , aldi nord 's trader joe 's and trw automotive are german-owned , so erecting barriers on trade could be complicated . 
  indeed , as the election shock fades , some german business leaders see an upside in potential trump administration measures such as higher infrastructure spending and a shift in energy policy back toward fossil fuels . 
  `` changes in the u.s. government 's constellation open possibilities for action that have n't existed before , '' said a spokesman for bilfinger se , an industrial-services company based in germany . 
  he cited keystone xl , an oil-pipeline project that mr. trump favors , although it was vetoed by president barack obama . 
  `` this is a project that 's important for our customers in the oil and gas sector , '' the bilfinger spokesman said . 
  the company , which provides industrial-maintenance , engineering and construction services , could be a candidate to build parts of this pipeline , the spokesman said . 
  industrial and technology conglomerate siemens , which posted u.s. revenue of $ 16.8 billion ( $ 17.8 billion ) in its fiscal year through sept. 30 , expressed confidence in the market . 
  `` we are certain that siemens will find many areas upon which we agree and can work productively with the new u.s. administration , '' a spokesman said . 
  another potential layer of insulation for many german companies is their sophisticated products , such as advanced machinery , which are n't widely produced in the u.s. `` the u.s. is weak in traditional industries where germany is strong , '' said marcel fratzscher , president of diw berlin , an economic think tank . 
  he predicted a shift in u.s. policy would n't hurt demand for german cars , machinery or chemicals .
