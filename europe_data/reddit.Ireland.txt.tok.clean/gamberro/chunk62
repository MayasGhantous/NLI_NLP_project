  `` without these products , the u.s. economy would have difficulty , '' he said . 
  german companies also could benefit from policy changes , said sebastian dullien , a professor of international economics at htw berlin . 
  if the u.s. increases spending and introduces tax cuts , that tends to usher in higher interest rates that would strengthen the dollar , an advantage for european exporters . 
  a stronger dollar , however , holds a danger , too , he warned . 
  `` if the dollar appreciates and european car manufacturers gain ground in the u.s. market , europe should be prepared to be confronted with protectionist measures -- just as japan was in the 1980s when the u.s. dollar surged , '' mr. dullien said . 
  while mr. trump so far has focused his criticism on china and mexico , mr. dullien warned that germany 's swollen trade surplus with the u.s. , long a sore point in washington , also could become a target . 
  `` the german finance ministry should prepare itself to draw fire , '' said mr. dullien . 
  germany 's global trade surplus is now nearly 9 % of gross domestic product , far larger than china 's 2.5 % , he noted . 
  and even if mr. trump remains focused mainly on restricting trade with mexico and china , german companies still could suffer . 
  that is because many , including adidas ag and volkswagen ag , export to the u.s. from plants in mexico that benefit from the north american free trade agreement , which mr. trump has pledged to renegotiate . 
  `` if the world 's biggest economic power is pursuing a protectionist path , then this will be felt around the globe , '' said reinhold festge , president of germany 's vdma engineering federation .

  is that you donald trump ? 
  yes and if those pubs are causing people to be poorly integrated into your society or other social problems , please shut them down . 
  if the salafists have their way , they will be . 
  one of the things i have always admired about catalonia is not just its welcoming of people coming there , but its ability to assimilate those who come into its own culture . 
  you can see children of andalusian or ecuadorian origin speaking catalan in the playground and even some of your leaders were born elsewhere . 
  people who want to islamicise catalonia or spain , who want to interpret/practice islam as at the time of muhammad are absolutely not interested in assmiliation or integration . 
  salafism is completely incompatible with european values , that 's why . 
  salafism/wahabbism is often a key source of radicalisation among muslims . 
  if you think this is no big deal , that 's your prerogative . 
  but if you choose to do so , you are in denial of a serious problem in my opinion . 
  this is a somewhat old article ( 6 months ) but i thought it was interesting and doubt the situation has changed much since it was published . 
  still , i will leave it up to the mods to decide whether to delete it or not . 
  ** salafists control one in three mosques in catalonia ** * the prayer rooms linked to this islamist movement have doubled in a decade * rebeca carranco in catalonia there are 79 salafist prayer rooms , according to catalan police data . 
  this means that one out of every three places of worship - 256 in total , according to the generalitat - follow this movement , to a greater or lesser extent . 
  the movement upholds a radical interpretation of islam , which calls for the establishment of a universal islamic order and the return to the forms of life of the time of muhammad . 
  it rejects any modernising or renewal of its religion . 
  the mossos d'esquadra closely follow the growth of this movement , which has been defined as the stepping stone or the ideological justification of violence . 
  `` we have some people under control , which are not of interest , '' explained the chief commissar of the mossos , jos\u00e9 luis trapero , in an interview on rac1 . 
  `` but do these people have a concrete will to want to carry out attacks ? '', 
  `` no , '' he added . 
  none of the latest 30 people detained by the security forces has been radicalized in a salafist center . 
  in this context , saleh el-maghamsi , a sheikh from saudi arabia and a salafist referent visited catalonia two months ago . 
  on his three-day trip , he filled the cornell\u00e0 mosque with about 600 people , where he preached twice . 
  then he received small groups of people in barcelona . 
  el-maghamsi landed in catalonia preceded by controversial statements , four years ago , in qatar tv . 
  there he explained that , in the eyes of allah , osama bin laden had died with honors and sanctity reserved for muslims . 
  the police monitored his speech in catalonia , and considers that it did not contain anything that might a crime and that would have justified its prohibition . 
  ** expansion in tarragona ** the number of salafist prayer rooms has doubled in the last decade ( in 2006 there were 36 ) . 
  the majority are concentrated in the districts of baix camp and camp de tarragona and in the south of barcelona . 
  also in lleida and salt there are some influential representatives at the local level . 
  among the associations that unite them , as an umbrella , is the federation of islamic cultural associations of the regions of girona ; the association of islamic union and cooperation of lleida and counties and the islamic community pastoral del tarragon\u00e8s . 
  its nature is diverse , and not everyone who attends a prayer room governed by a salafist board has to follow the movement closely . 
  with that in mind , it is estimated that 5 % of the muslim community ( a total of 490,000 people ) in catalonia follows the salafist movement , according to the data that the mossos handles . 
  `` although no one hands out salafist id cards , '' insists the chief inspector of analysis of the regional police . 
  in the rest of spain there are 30 prayer rooms attached to the movement , according to data from the ministry of interior . 
  the biggest risk of salafism is that it advocates `` social isolation '' , explains the professor and sociologist jordi moreras . 
  `` it is what gives justification to that voluntary process , '' he adds . 
  this newspaper has contacted representatives of two of the salafist communities in catalonia : salt - with mohammed atauil as one of the visible heads and a member of the new council of the union of islamic communities in catalonia - and reus . 
  both have chosen not to comment . 
  the growth of the community has been constant since the 1990s , although police have detected a slight slowdown in that upward trend ( from 15 % to 8 % , on the basis of estimates ) . 
  `` in catalonia , a concrete doctrinal line of islam has never been defined , and salafists take advantage of this mistake to propagate a message of truth , with a return to the essence of true islam , '' moreras adds . 
  that message fits easily , says moreras , because there has n't been a `` more interpretive , more contextual , more intellectual '' version of islam in catalonia . 
  `` we have had a wave of immigration with little cultural and less doctrinal preparation , in which islam is a legacy , an inheritance received from parents , in which this simple way of understanding it works . '', 
  `` but is there a danger is that they radicalize and carry out attacks ? '', 
  `` no , i do not think so , '' moreras insists . 
  in spite of that , visits like the ones of el-maghamsi , that saudi arabia or kuwait usually pay for , has put police agents on alert . 
  in two years ( between 2012 and 2015 ) , catalonia has celebrated 25 salafist congresses , according to data collected in the book la espa\u00f1a de al\u00e1 , by the journalist specialized in the maghreb ignacio cembrero . 
  `` it 's two or three a year , '' says the mossos analysis inspector . 
  these are gatherings that bring together hundreds of people , in which proselytizing , with outstanding guests from the salafist world , who come from the rest of spain , and from other countries , such as france or belgium . 
  until now , catalonia does not export well renowned figures , that spread the doctrine outside . 
  and its role in europe is still less if compared , for example , with the netherlands . 
  `` but sooner or later a figure of weight will appear , '' predicts moreras . 
  a possibility also contemplated by the mossos . 
  i somewhat agree with what you are saying . 
  i mean , does charity not have limits ? 
  i have talked many germans who disagree with me , both in viewing resettlement of refugees in europe as an act of charity and in putting limits to our help . 
  they seem to see accepting refugees in europe as a legal and moral obligation , irrespective of the ability of the host country to cope with so many people coming . 
  there are other ways to help those refugees resettlement in europe , including helping those in the refugee camps in turkey/jordan where a euro goes much further than here in europe . 
  i find it infuriating that a big chunk of the right refuses to even recognise this as an issue . 
  while they might say things i agree with the odd time , i struggle to take politicians on the populist right ( like farage or trump ) seriously when they are in denial of the biggest threat to mankind . 
  the left is constantly derided or accused of madness ( `` the loony left '' ) for a variety of issues , yet the right seems to get away scot free despite the threat this poses to our species ' survival . 
   out of touch politicians who do not care about the concerns of their constituents and are propped up by a broken democratic system are the ones digging our grave . 
  this is just a detail based on what you wrote . 
  i used to have some sympathy for the ukip supporters who are seriously unrepresented because of fptp . 
  but seeing how many applauded trump 's election because of a broken democratic system and fptp , i 've lost all sympathy . 
  the ukip supporters can not complain about fptp and then celebrate it when it gives the desired result . 
  fair enough . 
  all the best . 
  fair enough . 
  down here in dublin it 's not such a common occurrence . 
  i do n't mean to cause offence by asking this but is n't that a bit irredentist ? 
  those places have been part of france for many centuries and there is no significant political movement there to change that . 
  in my opinion the people there are free to decide whatever they want to be including being part of france . 
  it 's not that much better where i live in ireland . 
  every five years we might have proper snow ( stress might ) . 
  otherwise we do n't have it at all . 
  does it ever snow over in barcelona ? 
  as a mediterranean city by the sea , i ca n't imagine it does very often . 
  in some ways , it 's ironic that supporters of brexit are celebrating trump 's victory , as it comes down to winning first-past-the-post not winning the majority or even plurality of votes . 
  normally you guys are seething with rage over how unfair it is towards parties like ukip or how it means the people are n't listened to . 
  it 's nice to know it was all for show . 
   in the long run the french will be grateful to us for brexit . 
  we 're not expecting any thanks though . 
  what are you implying ? 
  no , he 's not a foreign leader but a foreign politician , a leading figure in the campaign for brexit , one the american conservatives are familiar with and one who gained widespread international coverage because of the referendum result . 
  it was not just the threats that farage objected to either , but the simple fact that obama had weighed in on the referendum . 
  look at farage 's own words : `` how dare the american president come here and tell us what to do ? '', 
  if you are so comfortable with foreign politicians campaigning in elections , maybe we should send ours over the next time you have yours ( * politicians * now , not leaders ) or if scotland holds another referendum .
