  i 'm sure you 'd be delighted . 
  `` how dare foreign leaders interfere in our elections !, 
  now if you excuse me , i 'm off to america to campaign for trump . '', 
  on another note , farage has appeared many times on fox news , the alt-right ( a key part of trump 's support ) knew who he was and he has also appeared at the conservative political action conference . 
  many americans know who he is . 
  they seem to have put on quite a show for him . 
  yet a few months later was appearing at trump rallies , [ including on stage with trump . 
  ] ( http://e3.365dm.com/16/08/536x302/3a409fb3906de7da7222e1ed8f80ea7c176c524035d68e5d525430abc57807c1_3771743.jpg ) farage has gone to other countries to weigh in on referendums there ( including my own ) . 
  his hypocrisy knows no bounds . 
  erdogan ** is ** threatening the eu , just in a very different way from the way russia is threatening the baltic countries . 
  in this case erdogan is threatening europe with another political crisis involving hundreds of thousands of people arriving in a matter of months . 
  i 'm curious about how turkey 's actions are perceived in the eastern eu member states . 
  surely they are concerned by turkey threatening to flood the eu with migrants on the one hand and demanding membership ( as well as billions of euro ) on the other . 
  ** giant steel shield to be placed over chernobyl ** * largest moveable structure ever built will cover disaster site * 3 hours ago by : roman olearchyk in kiev a giant steel shield said to be the largest moveable structure ever built will in the coming days be fully placed over the remains of the devastated reactor at chernobyl , the site of the world 's worst nuclear disaster . 
  thirty years after an explosion spread radioactive clouds across europe , the internationally financed $ 1.5 bn shield is designed to prevent radioactive material leaking out from the still highly contaminated site for the next century . 
  the construction of the shield is one of the world 's most ambitious engineering projects . 
  once it is in place early next week , ukrainian politicians and diplomats from around the world will visit the site to mark the occasion . 
  `` this is the culmination of many years of hard work by ukraine and the international community , '' said vince novak , director of nuclear safety at the european bank for reconstruction and development . 
  the ebrd is the financial administrator of the project , which was funded by more than 40 countries . 
  work on the shield , which the ebrd says is the largest moveable land-based structure ever built , began in 2012 on a site close to the reactor . 
  spanning 257 metres , with a length of 162 metres , height of 108 metres and a total weight of 36,000 tonnes , it is now being slowly pushed into place -- in 60cm bursts over a distance of 327 metres by a skidding system that involves 224 hydraulic jacks . 
  once it is in place , work will then begin on dismantling the shaky soviet-built sarcophagus built in the immediate aftermath of the disaster . 
  placing the arch over the reactor `` is the beginning of the end of a 30-year long fight with the consequences of the 1986 accident '' , said ostap semerak , ukraine 's ecology minister . 
  two workers were killed after the explosion on 26 april 1986 , which was initially denied by soviet leaders . 
  dozens of firefighters and clean-up workers fell to radiation poisoning . 
  cancer-related diseases caused by long-term radiation exposure are thought over decades to have claimed scores more victims . 
  a 3,000 square kilometre area around chernobyl remains unfit for living and farming , though there are now plans to develop the region as a source of clean energy . 
  mr semerak says nearly 10 companies are eyeing billion-dollar solar power projects . 
  this month , a subsidiary of china 's gcl group confirmed plans with china national complete engineering corporation to begin construction of a 1-gigawatt solar power plant near chernobyl next year . 
  `` there will be remarkable social benefits and economical ones as we try to renovate the once damaged area with green and renewable energy , '' said shu hua , chairman of gcl system integration technology . 
  such investments will also help ukraine diversify energy supply . 
  chernobyl 's last operating reactor was shut down in 1999 , but four other nuclear plants and coal-burning generators still generate most domestic electricity . 
  so far , solar power accounts for less than 1 per cent of domestic energy consumed . 
  russian natural gas imports have fallen sharply since moscow annexed crimea and fomented a separatist war in breakaway eastern regions . 
  other plans envision using the region for research and construction of the world 's largest dry spent nuclear fuel storage facility with ebrd and international backing . 
  this is more than just erdogan but rather the rise of political islam in turkey , the undermining of democracy and human rights there . 
  we 'll still be faced with this problem whenever erdogan goes/kicks the bucket . 
  you do realise that there were conspiracy theories about the clintons killing people back in the 1990s . 
  this is nothing new . 
  a lot of people talking about seth rich are mentioning victor thorn in the same breath . 
  they are also presenting him as a reliable source on the clintons breath , despite the fact that he was a conspiracy theorist with plenty of nonsense about 9/11 being an inside job and the jews . 
  no , i do n't . 
  i think that hacker guccifer was behind the hacking and subsequent leak . 
  snopes has pieces on the other people clinton supposedly killed according to the video . 
  you can keep believing this stuff if you 'd like . 
  why do you think they refuse to report it as a terrorist attack ? 
  i used to read pilger 's articles assiduously , have read a couple of his books and have seen most of his documentaries . 
  i still think a lot of his stuff is good , particularly on vietnam , cambodia and other places . 
  however , i 've lost respect for him a long time ago . 
  opposition to us foreign policy seems to shape his worldview on everything even to the point of absurdity . 
  he is completely silent on russian aggression in ukraine which he would never do if its role was replaced with the united states . 
  for example , in his [ article on trump ] ( https://newmatilda.com/2016/03/23/john-pilger-why-hillary-clinton-is-more-dangerous-than-donald-trump/ ) he describes the ukrainian government as a `` regime rotten with nazis '' and has described it before as `` run by a bunch of nazis . '' he 's saying all that despite democratic elections being held in ukraine repeatedly since 2014 ( in which the far-right won a minuscule number of seats ) . 
  he is repeatedly spouting russian propaganda and yet mentions propaganda in the same sentence . 
  i would n't trust his stuff on trump at all . 
  i wonder if he can give a credible media outlet that affirms that seth rich was the suspected dnc whistleblower ( he is presenting that as fact ) . 
  the wikipedia page presents nothing on him being a whistleblower . 
  meanwhile there are many other false conspiracy theories being spread about this case that [ snopes has debunked some . 
  ] ( http://www.snopes.com/seth-conrad-rich/ ) it maybe hard to believe for / u/gwengwengwen but it maybe this was just another murder given dc 's homicide rate which remains quite high by european standards . 
   just a tip : you sound like an impervious , creepy hack without the ability for critical thinking . 
  or maybe you come across as a little paranoid and into conspiracy theories . 
  good . 
  sadly , the alt-right or nationalists will not be liking this story . 
  i remember they were spreading conspiracy theories about this case or arguing that the murder was being politicised . 
  do you have a link about that ? 
  i 'd be interested to read more ( i can read french if that helps ) . 
  ** clock ticks for eu to reach imf deal on greece ** * by jim brunsden & kerin hope * financial times november 23 , 2016 the eurozone is running out of time to secure an agreement this year on international monetary fund participation in greece 's $ 86bn bailout amid splits over the country 's economic reforms , budget targets and debt relief . 
  the fund still wants reluctant eurozone capitals to provide more detail about how far they will go to ease greece 's mountainous debt burden . 
  getting the imf to take part in the greek rescue has been a key objective for eurozone governments , notably germany and the netherlands , since the bailout was agreed last year . 
  berlin sees the fund 's participation as critical to convince sceptical german lawmakers of the rigour and robustness of the programme -- but is also one of the governments most reluctant to grant greece major debt relief . 
  people familiar with the talks also say a decision on imf participation in the bailout is on hold until the latest progress review of the greek programme , which began last month , is completed . 
  officials are racing to make headway ahead of december 5 , the last scheduled meeting this year of eurozone finance ministers . 
  the imf has indicated it will seek to decide by the end of 2016 on its participation . 
  true . 
  but as a russian , you know better than anybody that the [ nazis broke their deals . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ), 
  the mods seem to have gotten rid of that . 
  it was funny while it lasted . 
  farage and the hardliners in the conservative party not only want the uk out but want the eu itself to be destroyed . 
  i 'd like the divorce ( along with post-divorce relations ) to be as amicable as possible , but i am fearful it wo n't be . 
  i do n't understand . 
  what do you mean ? 
  well done to the french authorities . 
  however , it saddens me that this has become normal . 
  ** edit : ** according to [ le monde ] ( http://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/video/2016/11/21/bernard-cazeneuve-evoque-un-attentat-dejoue_5035235_1653578.html ) these arrests bring to 418 the number of people that have been arrested * this year * for links with terrorist groups . 
  the number of muslims in the uk went from 1,600,000 in 2001 to 2,706,000 in 2011 ( an increase of 68.7 percent ) . 
  figures from [ this wikipedia page . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_the_united_kingdom ), 
  i do n't know who is down voting you or why . 
  however , you are correct in that the divergence is partly because we are different countries and see ourselves in different ways . 
   personally i think that the uk leaving the eu will be good for ireland 's internal democratic debate . 
  what makes you say that out of curiosity ? 
  i mean , most irish are in favour of us staying in the eu and even if it were the opposite , leaving would be complicated because of the euro . 
  the only way i see that changing is if the eu or the euro collapses , which is real possibilty ( as reflected in the article ) . 
  lad , take a chill pill . 
  there are euroskeptics on this sub and they are welcome here . 
  despite being in in favour of european integration , i accept that you guys want to leave , have made the decision and now we have to work through the divorce papers . 
  as somebody from a country that was hard hit by the eurocrisis , i know the eu has major faults . 
  but given that i am from a country that joined the eu at the same time as you did , that has a lot of cultural similarities ( and history ) with you , i am struck at how differently european integration is perceived over there compared to over here .
