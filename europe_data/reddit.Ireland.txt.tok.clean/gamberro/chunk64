  his comments came after russian media reported that investigators were targeting more people . 
  mr ulyukaev was put under house arrest for two months on tuesday after the investigative committee , the federal body probing serious crimes , said he had been caught red-handed on monday receiving a us$ 2m bribe extorted from state oil company rosneft for supporting its acquisition of a stake in smaller peer bashneft . 
  mr ulyukaev denies the allegations but president vladimir putin fired him on tuesday night citing loss of trust . 
  `` this is an extraordinary event for the government and the authorities of the country in general , '' dmitry medvedev , prime minister , said at an extraordinary cabinet meeting . 
  in private , some investors and government officials said the move against mr ulyukaev could undermine the authority of those in mr putin 's government who have helped to steer the economy through an oil price drop , rouble devaluation and western sanctions over the past two years . 
  two officials in the economy ministry and one large russian investor said they believed rosneft chief executive igor sechin , a former spy who long served as mr putin 's personal secretary , was involved in the move against mr ulyukaev as a warning to other proponents of liberal economic policies not to oppose him . 
  russian media reported that oleg feoktistov , head of security at rosneft , had led the sting operation which led to mr ulyukaev 's detention on monday night at the rosneft offices . 
  mr feoktistov joined rosneft in september from the fsb . 
  rosneft said neither the company nor mr sechin had any comment . 
  `` sechin was humiliated by the strong resistance from many people against rosneft 's acquisition of bashneft , '' said the investor . 
  `` this definitely weakens the economic bloc . '' alexei kudrin , mr putin 's former finance minister who advises him on economic policy , said in a russian television interview from new york that he had several open questions about the nature of the accusations against mr ulyukaev and the role of rosneft . 
  damage to the investment climate could be avoided only if the investigation was conducted in a transparent manner , mr kudrin said . 
  although many observers view mr ulyukaev 's fall as the result of a power struggle rather than a political move by mr putin , some evoked the history of how dictator josef stalin purged the soviet elite in the 1930s . 
  `` is it 1937 again ? '' asked a consultant in a pro-kremlin agency that has been working with the economy ministry . 
  alexei navalny , an opposition politician , said his anti-corruption fund was investigating mr ulyukaev for different suspicions of corruption but ridiculed the notion that the minister had tried to take on mr sechin and taken a suitcase of cash in dollars . 
  `` putin is afraid to be betrayed by his own elite , '' mr navalny said . 
  `` in order to avoid that you should do what every authoritarian regime in history has done -- terrorise your own circle by sending signals for everyone to be scared , '' he said . 
  mr ulyukaev was among a group of proponents of structural reforms and prudent macroeconomic management whose advice mr putin has largely followed despite shrill political rhetoric in recent years . 
  others include elvira nabiullina , the central bank governor , and herman gref , chief executive of state-owned sberbank . 
  analysts said mr ulyukaev 's fall was unlikely to signal a change in economic policy . 
  `` the president is rational enough to cancel out the consequences of his geopolitical and political decisions with the help of his liberal economists , '' said andrei kolesnikov , an analyst at the carnegie moscow centre . 
  but he added that it had apparently been deemed necessary that `` the entire putin team and inner circle be paralysed with fear '' . 
  nervousness after mr ulyukaev 's arrest deepened on wednesday when investigators searched the offices of rusnano , a state-owned technology company , and initiated a criminal case against managers at a pharmaceutical company in which rusnano has invested . 
  rusnano is headed by anatoly chubais , a former deputy prime minister who as architect of russia 's scandal-tainted privatisations in the 1990s is seen as the symbol of a negative side of liberal economic policies . 
  mr chubais had said he was shocked by the detention of mr ulyukaev . 
  the investigative committee said the case involving rusnano was not connected to mr ulyukaev . 
  `` it may be a separate investigation , '' said the consultant . 
  `` but i am certain that they timed the search to send a message . '', 
  are you american by chance ? 
  with regards income and standard of living , yes . 
  what does that have to do with my point about the `` mainstream media '' covering , not suppressing , the threat of terrorists among the migrants ? 
  eh , had n't most of greece proper already fallen to the ottomans by then ? 
  the byzantine empire was reduced to a city state by the time in fell in 1453 . 
  come on man . 
  i 'm not sure what counts as `` mainstream media '' ( especially in a continent like europe ) but the new york times would probably count as an example of that in the us . 
  yet they were publishing the claims of the far-right with regards terrorists among the migrants [ over a year ago .

  i did n't upvote or downvote him . 
  but who would have thought people in this sub about europe might be in favor of the eu ? 
  i 'm not going to upvote or downvote you . 
  but could you tell me why you think ireland would be better off outside the eu or why it should leave ? 
  the default and devalue parts would be quite painful , let 's be clear about this . 
  however , given that the status quo is also hurting greece and the prospect of crashing out of the union hovers over the country anyway , i think it should be considered . 
  i think you mean savings . 
  hmm ... 
  i am wondering what could cause the difference between northern ireland and the rest of the island ( the republic ) . 
  the nhs maybe ? 
   we also remember the honduran coup of 2009 for example , and nobody blinking an eye when a us ally is murdering its opposition leaders . 
  what events are you referring to ? 
  wait , are these sanctions directed against maduro himself ? 
  honest question as i did n't know that . 
  jesus , that is disturbing . 
  i 'd also like to point out the low carbon emissions from nuclear energy . 
  there seems to be a bit of a mismatch between `` green policies '' and low carbon/environmentally friendly ones . 
  that is pretty depressing . 
  their defence of the socialists ' handling of the economy is ironic , given that many of these people on the left in spain are often very much in favour of `` green policies . '', 
  the opposition to nuclear energy is very strong ( as seen in the closure of the plant in garo\u00f1a this week ) and the only other energy source they seem to advocate is renewables . 
  leaving aside maduro , what do the leftists in spain say about the economic crisis in venezuela ? 
  i mean , given that the socialists have been in power for 18 years , i think it 's pretty clear that the responsibility for the mismanagement of the economy rests with them . 
  can somebody shed more light on the repression in cuba ? 
  i do n't doubt that it happened ( although many people on the left do ) but i would like to know more about it . 
  what 's the problem ? 
  ** wooing suppliers ** the uk has enjoyed some success . 
  investments of more than # 2bn have been made in the past three years , while a number of items , such as exhausts , have fallen off the wish list as suppliers have set up business in the uk . 
  mr garnier , the uk trade minister , believes post-brexit britain will still be able to attract significant investment . 
  the country 's legal system , as well as its motorsports heritage and research and development , make it an attractive destination , he says , but admits brexit poses a `` challenge '' . 
  `` we can not try to say this is n't an issue when it comes to the european stuff , it would be lying , '' adding that brexit presents `` a great opportunity '' to rebuild the supply base . 
  many key areas of the chain are still lacking in the uk . 
  forging , the manufacturing process by which metal is shaped into parts under force , is a prime example of how the uk supply chain has been hollowed out . 
  in the mid-1970s , the industry churned out around 500,000 tonnes of forged parts each year , with 60 per cent going into passenger cars , commercial vehicles and off-highway equipment such as diggers , according to the confederation of british metalforming . 
  today it is just 130,000 tonnes , with less than a fifth destined for cars . 
  although some smaller forged car parts are made domestically , there are no large presses dedicated to passenger car crankshafts . 
  existing british sites that service the aerospace , trucking and mining industries could not easily be re-purposed for the task . 
  ken campbell , forging specialist at the cbm , says : `` you would need to have new plant '' , with a dedicated line producing crankshafts for cars . 
  this would cost `` tens of millions '' -- spending that is hard to justify without a strong commitment from customers . 
  another gap is in alloy wheels , despite the feature being one of the most popular additions to new cars . 
  the country 's only significant producer , rimstock , caters for the high-end market of supercars and racing vehicles . 
  `` making wheels is fairly simple , but it takes a lot of investment to do it right , '' says chief executive stephen lane . 
  any uk plant catering for mass-market vehicles would require # 200m of investment and need to make at least 2m wheels a year to be viable , he says . 
  rimstock is ramping up production to produce 650,000 wheels a year . 
  but it has no plans for mass-market expansion . 
  `` we 've looked at it , we 've cost checked it , '' he says . 
  `` it 's just too much of a stretch for us . '' ** electronics gap ** electronics , an increasingly important function in modern cars that use software to dictate features from steering assistance to wifi connection , is a gaping hole in the supply base . 
  electronic control units , the brain of the car 's infotainment and navigation system , are made in low-cost markets and shipped all over the world . 
  in europe , they tend to be assembled in romania , where labour costs are a fraction of the uk . 
  `` regardless of whether you are fiat in italy or jaguar land rover in halewood you 're buying from [ eastern europe ] , '' says matteo fini , an analyst at ihs , who specialises in the auto supply chain . 
  some parts have to be made locally because they are so heavy . 
  `` if you supply a large body panel , you need to be very close because logistics costs will kill you , '' says francisco riberas , chief executive of gestamp , the spanish metal stamping company . 
  `` it has to be local . '' the group confirmed a # 70m investment in a new uk pressing plant shortly after the brexit vote . 
  for some small businesses , the push to buy more british parts has led to a boom in orders . 
  yet others remain reluctant to gamble on major expansion to sell directly to the volume carmakers , which push their suppliers hard . 
  under `` just in time '' processes , parts arrive at a plant just hours before being fitted on to vehicles , with delivery windows as tight as 10 minutes . 
  `` if you miss a delivery the lines stop , '' says the manager of one uk plant . 
  `` you 've got to be on your game . '' ** trade deals : fine print will be crucial for uk car industry ** for the british car industry , the details of the brexit settlement will be all-important . 
  if the industry does not manage to rebuild its supply chain so that it can comply with rules of origin regulations on its own , the uk will need to negotiate a deal with the eu that allows the industry to count continental parts as `` british '' under what are known as principles of `` accumulation '' . 
  there are two main kinds -- bilateral accumulation would allow the uk to count eu parts as british when selling to the eu , while diagonal accumulation would allow the same parts to be counted as british when sold outside the eu . `` in the future we need to make sure that the european parts count towards uk content , and vice versa , '' says mike hawes , chief executive of the uk motor industry lobby group , the smmt . 
  `` this is an area the government needs to prioritise in negotiations . '' jessica gladstone , a partner at law firm clifford chance , says the industry will need more than just a free-trade agreement with the eu : it will also need to negotiate a threshold for domestically-sourced components that is `` low enough for all our cars to pass '' . 
  in the eu 's trade agreement with south korea , 55 per cent of components need to be domestic for the final car to be considered locally made . 
  with canada it is 50 per cent , rising after seven years to 55 per cent . `` the rules are designed to keep other people out , '' says sam lowe , a london-based trade analyst . 
  `` you ca n't see it going below 50 per cent [ in a uk-eu deal ] .
