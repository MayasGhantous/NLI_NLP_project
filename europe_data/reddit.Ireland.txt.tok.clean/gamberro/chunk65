  ** brexit triggers a great car parts race for uk auto industry ** * eu exit will damage competitiveness if carmakers can not source more components at home * yesterday by : peter campbell and michael pooler if you drive one of the 1.7 m cars built in the uk last year it is likely the power steering on the vehicle was manufactured in germany ; the electronic control units came via romania ; and the shock absorbers travelled all the way from poland . 
  indeed , more than half the 30,000 components in an average british-made car come from somewhere else . 
  until june 23 last year that represented a triumph of modern supply chain logistics . 
  now , with the uk leaving the eu , it is less a marvel and more a problem . 
  the auto sector , which employs more than 800,000 people in the uk with 170,000 in manufacturing roles , is one of the most important tests of how brexit will impact british industry . 
  under trade rules that the uk is likely to face after it leaves the eu , british auto exports could attract hefty tariffs if carmakers are unable to source a far higher proportion of the components going into the average nissan , honda , or vauxhall from within the uk . 
  `` world trade organisation rules would mean a 10 per cent tariff on vehicles and an average 4.5 per cent tariff on components , '' says mike hawes , chief executive at the society of motor manufacturers and traders , the industry body . 
  `` the cost of our production would increase more than our competitors . 
  british competitiveness would be undermined . 
  the cost of cars for british consumers could increase . '' while the supplier base has expanded in recent years , uk automakers still rely on the eu . 
  `` we have a huge dependency on europe , '' says ralf speth , chief executive of jaguar land rover , britain 's largest carmaker . 
  `` you simply ca n't buy some components in the uk . '' nissan earlier this year invited a large group of international component manufacturers to its uk base in north-east england and made a simple pitch : please come to britain . 
  in the wake of brexit the japanese carmaker had received assurances from the government that its operations would be insulated from its worst effects and it had responded by committing to make its next generation of sports utility vehicles at its sunderland assembly plant . 
  senior executives from the company and even the uk trade minister mark garnier were on hand to answer questions from the suppliers , who ranged from metal bashers to intricate component makers . 
  what nissan started others , including jaguar land rover , toyota , vauxhall and bmw 's mini , replicated giving birth to a concerted nationwide effort to rebuild the uk 's automotive supply chain . 
  in theory , brexit presents an opportunity to spur uk production of components , providing a boost to the industrial base and the broader economy . 
  but if those efforts fall short , uk car plants could become much less competitive . 
  in an announcement that the british government called a `` vote of confidence '' in the uk , bmw said last week that it would build the first electric mini in the uk from 2019 . 
  however , in a sign of the broader dilemma for the industry , the battery that will power the car will be manufactured in germany . 
  ** drop in investment ** nissan , which exports 55 per cent of its uk production to europe , has been at the forefront of efforts to attract new suppliers to britain , but it has also sounded the alarm about brexit . 
  colin lawther , the carmaker 's european manufacturing director , told mps on a select committee in february that the sunderland plant `` will not succeed in the future , with or without brexit , unless the government does something to help us in the supply chain '' . 
  he asked for a # 100m fund to help carmakers relocate parts-makers to britain . 
  mps asked whether , without the money , the sunderland site was safe . 
  `` no , '' he added . 
  `` i would n't say that . '' the uncertainty around brexit has already taken its toll on the industry . 
  investment in the auto sector fell from # 2.5 bn in 2015 to # 1.66 bn last year , and has slid to just # 322m in the first six months of 2017 , according to the smmt . 
  it warned last week that uk car production could drop 10 per cent if britain does not secure a transitional deal to allow the industry to carry on trading with europe after brexit , while the full terms of a trade deal are agreed . 
  while uk components once accounted for 80 per cent of parts in british-built cars , the figure fell to the low 30s during the 1990s and early 2000s . 
  but it has been slowly climbing again , rising to 44 per cent this year , according to the automotive council , a collaboration between government and the private sector . 
  brexit is now providing new urgency . 
  once britain leaves the eu , it must forge its own free trade agreements that allow it to sell goods to other nations without incurring costly tariffs . 
  but ftas typically stipulate that cars must contain a certain percentage of components from the country of manufacture , under `` rules of origin '' regulations . 
  experts believe that for the uk that could mean at least half of all parts will need to be sourced domestically . 
  of those 30,000 components in modern vehicles , each one may contain 30 sub-components and have passed through 15 countries during the course of its production , according to clepa , the european supply chain organisation . 
  with many of the parts going into tier one components coming from overseas , it is therefore highly likely that the true uk make-up of vehicle components is far lower than 44 per cent , making the gap to be bridged even larger . 
  without clearing the parts threshold , the cars made on british production lines would be subject to wto tariffs of 10 per cent -- making them much more expensive . 
  an obvious solution would be to force carmakers in the uk to buy from domestic suppliers . 
  but in many cases , the parts are not available . 
  land rover , which has annual production touching 600,000 vehicles , buys 40 per cent of its materials from europe . 
  for the recent launch of the # 60,000 range rover velar it convinced a french bumper company , plastic omnium , to set up operations in britain , with the promise of work supplying other models in its range . 
  but such an arrangement can not be replicated with more complex parts . 
  from alloy wheels to in-car electronics , many of the components are difficult to build at scale in a market where vehicle output is less than one-third of the size of germany , which produces 6m a year . 
  `` it 's not like you could do everything in the uk , '' says nigel stein , chief executive of british manufacturing group gkn . 
  `` in today 's economy you have to have economic scale and you 're not going to have it in every country in the world . '' in 2014 , the automotive council drew up a list of the supply chain elements that the uk could attract . 
  it featured engine castings , the metal frame for a car 's engine , as well as seat components , alloy wheels , lighting , paint , bumpers and instrument clusters . 
  a new government body , the automotive investment organisation , was set up to attract new plants . 
  the courting process to woo suppliers can last from months to several years , and typically involves meeting a senior government minister , a tour of a uk car facility and dinner in a private room at the royal automobile club on pall mall . 
  in my opinion , the real issue is confronting/addressing islamism , both in its violent and non violent forms , as well as promoting assimilation .

  ** spanish pm is witness in fraud and bribery case centred on construction boom ** * 7 hours ago by : ian mount in madrid * mariano rajoy tried to avoid the unwanted spectacle of a court appearance this week . 
  spain 's prime minister said it would waste public funds to require him to travel from madrid to san fernando de henares , where he is set to appear as a witness in a sprawling fraud and bribery case that links local business leaders and politicians of his ruling centre-right popular party . 
  the court 's response was withering : how much could it really cost given that san fernando is just 18km from the spanish capital ? 
  mr rajoy could be forgiven for looking hard for any excuse not to attend . 
  he is not on trial . 
  but with worries mounting about corruption hurting the pp in opinion polls , mr rajoy 's appearance on wednesday -- the first time a sitting spanish prime minister would be a witness in a court case -- promises to be uncomfortable for premier and party alike . 
  `` there 's a structural concern [ in spain ] about corruption now , and it wo n't go down , '' says pablo sim\u00f3n , a political science professor at madrid 's carlos iii university . 
  involving 37 defendants and more than 300 witnesses , the extensive trial is an exploration of the symbiotic relationship between business and politics during spain 's decade-long construction boom , which ended with a dramatic bursting of the property bubble in 2008 . 
  known as the g\u00fcrtel case , the affair centres on a pp-linked event organiser named francisco correa , who liked to be called don vito , after a character in the godfather . 
  prosecutors accused mr correa of acting as a middleman , receiving millions in illegal commissions for himself and pp politicians in exchange for obtaining public contracts for builders and other businesses , some of which he controlled . 
  the investigation began in 2008 after a former pp councillor recorded conversations with mr correa and filed a complaint with spain 's anti corruption office . 
  mr correa has already been judged in one part of the sprawling case . 
  in february , he was sentenced to 13 years in prison for rigging tourism conference contracts in valencia . 
  associates known as the moustache and the pearl were among 10 others to be given jail sentences . 
  in a separate branch of the case , former pp treasurer luis b\u00e1rcenas is accused of setting up a slush fund to top up the salaries of pp leaders . 
  he has said he made payments to senior pp members , including mr rajoy . 
  mr rajoy has not been accused of wrongdoing in the g\u00fcrtel case and has flatly denied receiving payments or being involved in a kickback scheme . 
  `` i have neither received or distributed ` black ' money , neither in this party or anywhere else ; it 's false , '' mr rajoy said in 2013 , shortly before he released 10 years of his tax returns in an attempt to prove he had not received any payments . 
  prosecutors hope he can shed light on the elaborate affair , as he has served as secretary-general and then president of the pp since 2004 . 
  he is expected to deny involvement or knowledge again on wednesday , portraying spain 's ruling party as the victim of unscrupulous people who took advantage of pp ties for personal gain . 
  while mr rajoy is getting credit for spain 's improving economy -- it is creating more than 650,000 jobs a year -- corruption has risen up the list of voters ' concerns . 
  in june , almost half of voters in a survey from the cis research institute named corruption as one of the country 's three biggest problems , up from 34 per cent at the beginning of the year . 
  `` employment keeps growing and gdp is expanding by 3-3 .5 per cent . 
  but support for the pp is not rising but falling . 
  corruption is short circuiting the process . 
  it must be a bittersweet feeling for [ mr rajoy ] , '' says mr sim\u00f3n . 
  a poll of polls produced for the el pa\u00eds newspaper shows the pp receiving a 29 per cent vote share , down six points from last autumn , while the socialist party and the liberal party ciudadanos , which has a deal to support the pp on key issues , have gained ground . 
  still , mr rajoy 's position as prime minister should be safe . 
  the leftwing opposition is fractured , with both the psoe and podemos having had leadership battles , and the combined opposition would need to join with catalan separatist parties to replace mr rajoy . 
  and while ciudadanos has a strong anti-corruption platform , it still polls in fourth place with less than 17 per cent of the vote . 
  unless any shattering revelations about mr rajoy emerge , ciudadanos will probably be content to use its increased leverage with a weakened pp to achieve its goals on issues such as more paternity leave and lower taxes . 
  mr rajoy has already passed a budget in 2017 with the help of ciudadanos and several regional parties , and spain does not need national elections until 2020 . 
  for now , the biggest threat for mr rajoy 's government and the pp remains that the trials uncover incriminating evidence , perhaps with the help of mr correa or mr b\u00e1rcenas looking to cut a deal . 
  `` having to declare in front of judge is very negative for the pp but at the same time the political cycle does n't favour a broad impact , '' says antonio barroso , eurozone analyst at teneo intelligence . 
  `` in the long term , corruption is the issue that stops the pp from getting an absolute majority . 
  but it does n't mean they will lose the next elections . '', 
  what are you getting at ? 
  ** rajoy is cutting it fine with his catalonian intervention ** * the spanish premier 's offer on fiscal autonomy may be too little , too late *  the clich\u00e9 `` better late than never '' was not coined for politics , where timing can be everything . 
  so when the leaders of spain 's two post-franco parties of central government -- the centre-right popular party ( pp ) , currently in power , and the opposition socialists ( psoe ) -- propose alternatives to the secession of catalonia 10 weeks before the separatist catalan autonomous government holds a referendum on independence , there are questions about timing and substance . 
   mariano rajoy , prime minister and leader of a minority pp government , said in bilbao recently that the path forward for catalans is the basque way . 
  unlike the catalans , the basques collect their own taxes . 
  `` what the government of spain and the basque government are doing today is what should be done , '' mr rajoy declared . 
   fiscal autonomy on basque lines was , in fact , what the government in barcelona sought from madrid in september 2012 .
