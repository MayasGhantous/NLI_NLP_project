  mr rajoy refused even to discuss it . 
  millions poured on to the streets of catalonia and separatism went mainstream . 
   meanwhile pedro s\u00e1nchez , the socialist leader , called for a recasting of the spanish constitution along deeper federal lines , in order to accommodate historic nations such as the catalans and basques . 
  `` the spain [ which is ] a nation of nations is coming , because centralism is the past , '' he said . 
  his statement was part of an attempt to refloat the catalan sister party of the psoe , which has been caught in the crossfire between separatism and unionism , and reduced to electoral hardship ( history shows that the socialists need to carry catalonia to win in spain ) . 
   while this all sounds statesmanlike , waiting almost until the eve of a constitutional train-crash that could wreck spain is not . 
  yet these ideas -- more federalism and more fiscal autonomy under a reformed constitution -- are almost certainly the only way out of a mess for which mr rajoy and his party bear heavy responsibility . 
   it used to be the basque question , inflamed by separatist violence , that bedevilled the post-franco formula of democracy and devolution . 
  that started changing in 2010 , when the constitutional court , at the urging of the pp , eviscerated the reformed catalan statute of autonomy , in what always looked more a political than a legal decision . 
  the reformed charter had been approved by the parliaments in madrid and barcelona , and catalans endorsed it in a referendum . 
  constitutional lawyers , and politicians who helped write the constitution , say if the court thought it was unconstitutional , legally it should have said so before these democratic votes . 
   both major parties have at times needed support from catalan and basque nationalists to ensure a majority in spain 's parliament , and have traded more devolved power in exchange . 
  but the pp has also at times found it electorally rewarding in the rest of spain to incite antagonism against the basque country and catalonia , where its centralising instincts severely limit its support . 
   right now , the mainstream basque nationalist party , the pnv , and the pp are , if not on the same page , at least on the same trading floor . 
  the pp needs the pnv 's five mps in madrid to get measures such as the budget through . 
  the cost is high : a further reduction in the revenue that basques remit to madrid ( roughly a tenth of the amount catalonia sends ) ; a big fiscal rebate ; and a $ 3.4 bn high-speed train package to join up all spurs inside basque territory . 
  mainstream catalan nationalists -- who for the past five years have played sorcerers ' apprentice to separatism -- look cack-handed as well as empty-handed in light of this basque bonanza . 
  for decades , moreover , they have failed to persuade madrid to develop the `` mediterranean corridor '' down spain 's east coast , even though the eu has identified this trade and infrastructure axis as a priority . 
   madrid is emptying for the summer , but the constitutional court will be sitting next month , honing its legal weapons against the catalan plebiscite . 
  secessionists have never polled more than 47 per cent , but every injunction helps their cause . 
  the test of the new openness demonstrated by messrs rajoy and sanchez will be if madrid drops the alibi that spain is trapped in a legal labyrinth , in which the constitution is a tablet of stone , and judges are shields against a political problem elected politicians have a duty to resolve . 
  mr sanchez put it well in barcelona : `` if it were simply enough to obey the law , we would be governed by judges . '', 
  see ? 
  we were n't the first . 
  the germans did it before us !, 
  nice . 
  where abouts are you from lad ? 
  i think turkish prison has changed a bit since midnight express . 
   the gaza pullout was supposed to be just the first move in a tit for tat exchange . 
  israel pulled out it 's ground forces and fatah was supposed to do their own show of good faith . 
  so where is it ? 
  that 's not true or at least was a bizarre `` show of good faith '' . 
  after the pullout ( even in 2005 and 2006 ) settlements kept being built as you can see [ here ] ( https://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/09/israeli_setttlements ) . 
  maybe , just maybe , instead of the disengagement from gaza being a big peaceful gesture ( as israel 's supporters like to portray it as ) , it was a strategic withdrawal to consolidate on settlements elsewhere in the west bank . 
  again look how difficult it was for israel to remove 10,000 settlers from gaza ( with the huge tensions and clashes with settlers ) . 
  how can people claim that it is going to withdraw hundreds of thousands of settlers ? 
  also look at how controversial at a simple moratorium on settlement construction was . 
  i think it 's pretty clear that israel wants to annex as much as possible of the west bank and/or create conditions on the ground to ensure any palestinian state is much reduced from the 1967 borders . 
  peace , in the form of a two-state solution , is impossible if a palestinian state is n't viable . 
  if israel continues building settlements as it is doing , it will ultimately become either an apartheid state or be forced to accept a one-state solution . 
  you know you 've lived in a city too long when you know exactly where a generic stock photo was taken . 
  i was told once that the storehouse has more visitors than the eiffel tower . 
  the tourist agencies definitely used the data collected from visitors to help gauge trends in tourists visiting ireland . 
  i did , my mistake . 
  i 've changed that now . 
  i can definitely recommend killarney national park . 
  however , if you are only in dublin and would like to see a bit of nature , i can also recommend [ glendalough ] ( http://www.glendalough.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/header3.jpg ) , [ powerscourt house ] ( http://powerscourt.com/media/121.jpg ) or [ powerscourt waterfall . 
  ] ( http://www.activeme.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/powerscourt-waterfall-wicklow-way1.jpg ), 
  you 're right , removing around 10,000 jewish settlers from gaza was extremely controversial at the time . 
  yet we are supposed to believe israel would remove hundreds of thousands of settlers ( that are increasing all the time ) from the west bank in exchange for peace ? 
  many supporters of israel , including my jewish relatives , seem to think so but i find that na\u00efve . 
  even after they removed settlers from gaza , israel controlled the airspace , borders and maritime waters of the strip . 
  it also controlled them to such an extent that it effectively putting a stranglehold on its economy ( which being such a tiny strip is heavily reliant on the outside world ) . 
  a lot of the right and far right in the states likes to right off europe as a continent `` overrun by muslims '' and being `` destroyed by liberalism . '', 
  so seeing that this problem ( i 'm not denying that it is a disgusting and barbaric problem ) is worse in the country whose media hates us so much , puts the problems we are facing into context . 
  many people , particularly on the left , attribute the blame for russia 's actions on nato expansion and argue that it is trying to avoid being surrounded by a hostile alliance . 
  i do n't agree with it but does anybody else want to share their thoughts on that ? 
  yep . 
  how does a catalan know so much about the gfa and its implications ? 
  i agree with you . 
  but many of the british tabloids and people on the right like norman tebbit paint a very different picture of the dispute . 
  as somebody who has done a good few hours unpaid overtime this week , i say bravo !, 
  they saw spain as a `` c\u00e1rcel de pueblos '' and as such were sympathetic to those who were opposed to it or who wanted to break away from it . 
  they also saw groups like the guardia civil as a paramilitary organisation and therefore a legitimate target . 
  when i was in valladolid i met some castilian nationalists who were sympathetic to eta . 
  they would probably admit themselves that they were pretty radical though . 
  regardless of whether it happens or not , the catalan nationalists certainly are going to try and achieve independence soon . 
  so let 's not close the thread . 
  i do n't want to get involved in a dispute with another user , but i have also seen you attack / u/gerardpb2 in your comments . 
  civility to other users does n't hurt and that goes for everybody . 
  with regards the article itself , do n't you think the unionists ' cause is hindered a bit in that the spanish government has refused to allow a referendum ? 
  many of them ( like ciudadanos ) are also opposed to holding a referendum . 
  as the article itself says they are not organised and without a spokesperson for them . 
  it 's hard to organise a `` no '' campaign if many of your supporters are opposed to a vote even being held . 
   as not an german , or resident of germany , merkel seems to have done a fine job through all the crises ... 
  many commentators have argued that the migrant crisis was an episode when her judgement failed her . 
  i ca n't help but think it was a disaster that she made worse . 
  i agree , but that does n't stop people in catalonia wanting perpignan to become part of their country or believing that it is part of their nation . 
  eh ... irish unification depends on the people of northern ireland choosing to join with the rest of the island . 
  at the moment opinion polling there shows a different picture . 
  many catalan nationalists hold irredentist views towards perpignan in france ( which they refer to as northern catalonia ) . 
  the region is seen by them as a perpetual part of the same nation , despite the fact that it has been in france since 1659 and support for independence is marginal . 
  the mountain of canig\u00f3 ( which is in ** france ** ) is seen as the `` highest mountain in catalonia . '', 
  [ a quick google search ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?q=canig%c3%b3+estelada&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewij5dpty4nvahwei1akhq2iaueq_auicigb&amp;biw=1075&amp;bih=425 ) shows many nationalists travel there and consider it part of their nation . 
  now i wonder , how many of those are from the french side of the border where separation from france is a marginal position ? 
  very few i 'd imagine . 
  basically , how do those people expect france to support them or be open to them if they hold such irredentist views on a part of its territory ? 
  ** edit : ** [ here 's another video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcphmwok95e ) of nationalists lighting bonfires on canig\u00f3 , again from people who are not from the french side of the border . 
  you know what , i think the case of catalonia becoming a member state would be made easier if the catalan nationalists dropped their irredentism towards perpignan ( and to a lesser extent towards other parts of spain ) . 
  google canig\u00f3 plus estelada and you will see countless pictures of catalan nationalists there . 
  how many i wonder are from the french side of the border ? 
  very few i 'd imagine . 
  how on earth do expect france ( who would be your neighbour in an independent catalonia ) to support you if you hold such irredentist views on a part of its territory . 
  i believe [ this is the written statement ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getallanswers.do?reference=e-2017-003486&amp;language=en ) from juncker about this issue and which the el pa\u00eds article refers . 
  it does n't say anywhere * explicitly * in this text that catalonia would leave the eu ( i may be wrong so please feel free to correct me ) . 
  also a bit of courtesy does n't harm anybody . 
  there is no need to insult other users here like that . 
  that 's what i thought too . 
  it looks like the guy is piling on the pounds though . 
  a lot of people , particularly on the left , disagree or argue that we should completely open the borders and allow in anybody who wants to cross them .
