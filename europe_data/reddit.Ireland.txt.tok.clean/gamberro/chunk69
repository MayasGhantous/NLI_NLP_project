  but the change is perhaps most evident on the street . 
  in recent years , catalonia has seen some of the largest demonstrations in europe , with hundreds of thousands of marchers calling for secession every year on september 11 , catalonia 's national day . 
  on other days , catalans express their views from balconies and windows , thousands of which are covered with the distinctive red-yellow-and-blue estelada , the flag of catalan independence . 
  to know the political allegiance of a city , village or street in the region , all you have to do is look up . 
  there is , as yet , no majority in catalonia for independence . 
  nor is it certain that catalans will be able to vote later this year . 
  madrid has vowed to block the ballot , arguing that spain 's constitution leaves no room for regional self-determination . 
  the spanish constitutional court takes the same line , meaning that the ballot , if it goes ahead , will have no legal effect . 
  yet no matter what happens in the coming months , the story of catalonia 's recent push for independence remains a remarkable tale , and one that resonates far beyond the borders of spain . 
  it is part of a broader awakening of national and nationalist sentiment across europe : countries that until recently seemed content to hitch their fate to that of larger entities are clamouring to stand alone once again . 
  flags are making a comeback , as are demands for higher walls and harder barriers . 
  there is a sense of fragmentation both within and between countries : scotland has tried to leave britain , britain is leaving the eu and now catalonia is trying to leave spain . 
  the seams that stitched together a broken continent are starting to unravel -- not everywhere , but in enough places to give pause for thought . 
  the catalan independence movement fits the broader pattern but it has its peculiarities . 
  it remains , for example , staunchly pro-european and internationalist . 
  supporters hail from almost all political camps , from religious conservatives to far-left anarchists . 
  yet the parallels with other independence movements are also striking , not least the degree to which the political shift has been fuelled by europe 's recent crisis and the economic pain and social dislocation it wrought . 
  `` the economic crisis has brought us populism and nationalism -- magical solutions for a complicated situation that is indeed desperate for many people , '' says in\u00e9s arrimadas , leader of the anti-independence ciudadanos party in catalonia . 
  `` in other countries they say everything is the fault of europe . 
  here in catalonia they say everything is the fault of spain . '' catalan leaders declare that they are determined to push ahead with a referendum , even if that means defying the government in madrid . 
  as far as they are concerned , the word of spain is no longer law . 
  `` they can open criminal proceedings against hundreds of people . 
  they can threaten us with prison . 
  they can threaten to take back powers , '' artur mas , the former catalan president , tells me . 
  `` all this they can do . 
  but what will they do if there are millions of people in the street ? 
  who will they send ? '' the looming conflict is not just about the future of catalonia but also about the soul of spain . 
  even harsh critics of the catalan independence movement argue that spain must change , and change profoundly , if it wants to keep the centrifugal forces at bay . 
  for spain , every estelada hanging from a barcelona balcony is a reminder of its own historic failure to forge a single nation from the different tribes and tongues that populate the peninsula . 
  five centuries after the catholic kings united the crowns of castile and aragon , spain has to live with the fact that basques and catalans have not only preserved their languages but that many still see themselves as nations apart . 
  for some spaniards , who dream of a monolithic nation state \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise , this is hard to accept . 
  for others , it offers an opportunity to overhaul old structures , both mental and constitutional , and turn spain into a state that provides more room for different identities and nations , even the catalan one . 
  for that to happen , however , spain may have to extend yet more rights and powers to catalonia . 
  what is more , time for such an agreed solution is running out . 
  polls suggest that the number of catalans who feel both catalan and spanish is shrinking over time ; the younger generation , who have been schooled in catalan and often have less contact with the rest of spain than their parents , are among the most enthusiastic backers of independence . 
  julia vernet , a 21-year-old philosophy student at the autonomous university in barcelona , is a case in point . 
  `` i did n't have to think a great deal about becoming an independentista . 
  it was very intuitive , '' she says . 
  in her free time , vernet leads the youth wing of the catalan national assembly , a grassroots independence movement . 
  though half her family hails from other parts of spain , she was raised and educated in catalan and feels increasingly disconnected from the spanish capital . 
  `` i feel catalan and i want a state that represents me . 
  there is an abyss between politicians in spain and myself -- we speak different languages , and in different registers . '' if catalonia ever does become independent , historians will probably look to september 13 2009 , and the event that took place in arenys de munt that day , as one of the sparks that started the secessionist fire . 
  a hillside town of 8,600 inhabitants , arenys can be reached by train and bus from barcelona in little more than an hour . 
  for much of the journey , the rail tracks run right alongside the glistening azure waters of the mediterranean . 
  looking out towards the sea , i thought that there can not be many places in the world that afford a better life than catalonia : the beaches of the costa brava in summer , the peaks of the pyrenees in winter , the glories of barcelona all year round . 
  whether in economic or gastronomic terms , architecture or football , the region seems blessed . 
  yet the discontent was evident : with every kilometre , the number of esteladas increased . 
  by the last stretch of the journey , there was an independence flag hanging from every second tree . 
  arenys de munt is a quiet , prosperous kind of place , with an unemployment rate below the already low catalan average . 
  it is also a bastion of the secession movement . 
  of the 13 local councillors , 11 are committed to independence . 
  many locals told me that in mind , if not in law , the town broke with spain many years back . 
  the sentiment was made manifest eight years ago , when arenys became the first town in catalonia to hold a symbolic independence referendum . 
  `` the police had to close the entrance into town because so many people wanted to come . 
  there was a river of people coming up from the train station . 
  they could n't vote , but they wanted to see us vote , '' recalls josep manel ximenis , a local activist and former mayor . 
  as people have pointed out elsewhere in the thread , many were born on the islands and a distinct culture had started to form amongst them . 
  i do n't see this as a de-colonization issue but i do wonder how they do n't have the same right to their land as the falkland islanders ? 
  it was n't empty in the 1960s . 
  that 's the problem . 
  nobody is suggesting that the british control over the islands would change if the chagossians should return . 
  exactly . 
  it 's somewhat ironic that the uk pursued such divergent policies with regards the falkland islanders and the chagossians . 
  i 'm not a fan of john pilger , but he made a reasonably good documentary on this topic called `` stealing a nation '' ( you can find it on youtube if you 're interested ) . 
  until the eviction of the inhabitants , the chagos islands were inhabited continuously since the end of the 18th century ( roughly the same time the falklands were first settled by english sealers ) . 
  ** brexit set to blow hole in common eu budget , brussels warns ** paper suggests ways to fill gap , including taxes and overhaul of farm spending 3 hours ago by : jim brunsden in brussels brexit risks stretching the eu 's common budget to breaking point , brussels is warning as it braces for a clash with member states by setting out ideas to plug the financial gap.tapping money that the european central bank makes from issuing currency , and applying common energy or environmental taxes to imports are among the options that brussels has put on the table for reforming the eu budget in a paper seen by the financial times . 
  the european commission paper also broaches sensitive questions of how to reform eu farm spending and regional aid programmes , saying one option would be to ask national governments to part-finance some farm subsidies . 
  in a section likely to raise hackles in some national capitals , the paper also warns that life as a european civil servant is becoming less attractive and that `` a further reduction in staff levels could jeopardise the good functioning of the eu institutions '' . 
  `` previous reforms have reduced salaries , increased working time and pension age , '' the paper says . 
  `` there is clearly a declining interest of young people from member states with relatively high per capita income to join the eu institutions . 
  the trend is clear . 
  the eu budget is equivalent to about 1 per cent of eu gross domestic product , and britain 's impending departure means the eu will lose one of its main contributors . 
  while estimates vary because some spending commitments are multiyear , a report from the uk 's house of lords put the british contribution at 12 per cent . 
  the funding gap , and the possibility of a big political fight over how to fill it , is one of the main factors behind the push from eu capitals for britain to pay a hefty exit bill as part of its brexit divorce . 
  in its `` reflection paper '' on wednesday , the commission will warn that brexit comes as the eu is being asked to take on extra work . 
  managing migration , fighting terrorism , and defence policy have risen up the eu agenda since its last multi-annual budget was agreed in 2013 . `` hard choices will need to be made to bridge the gaps , '' the draft paper says , noting that `` the union is not able to borrow , nor can it print money '' . 
  about 80 per cent of the eu budget is financed by contributions from governments and a share of national vat receipts , with much of the rest coming from customs revenues . 
  some of the ideas for future funding hinge on the bloc agreeing new policy measures , such as a financial transaction tax or energy and environmental taxes to be applied at the eu border . 
  other ideas include levies from the eu 's emissions trading scheme , and fees linked to a planned online authorisation system for people travelling to europe . 
  the paper mentions the option of transferring ecb revenues earned from so-called `` seigniorage '' -- essentially the difference between the face value of ecb notes and coins and their production cost . 
  such a step would hit national central banks and normally require changes to eu treaties . 
  the paper also looks at how brussels could do more to leverage its budget . 
  the commission has already explored ways of using public money to stimulate private investment , including a european fund for strategic investments launched in 2015 with the target of mobilising $ 315bn of funding in its first three years . 
  it also says governments should provide more `` co-financing '' to projects supported by eu `` cohesion policy '' funding , which accounts for a big chunk of the bloc 's budget and finances everything from skills training to road building . 
  brussels will present more detailed proposals next year . 
  the paper sets out five broad reform `` scenarios '' , ranging from scaling back the budget and establishing a system where groups of member states would establish common pots of money for particular projects , to a `` radical redesign . '', 
  tell that to the gop and the alt-right . 
  i brought the topic up with an alt-right supporter the other day on reddit and they said : `` unlawful combatants , working for terrorist organisations , not on us soil have no legal protections . 
  anything else is wishful revisionist interpretation . '', 
  it depends . 
  a friend of mine works for a company that brings construction workers and electricians over to sweden ( primarily from southern europe ) . 
  based on the size of their new offices , they are doing pretty well . 
  i think i can understand their feelings towards turkey . 
  if the us ever declares war on somebody while trump is in office , it 'll probably be declared on twitter ( and by trump himself ) . 
  ** rome sets aside $ 17bn to wind down failing lenders ** * intesa to partially acquire veneto lenders to avoid a bank run * yesterday by : rachel sanderson in milan , alex barker in brussels and claire jones in sintra italy has moved to shore up confidence in its fragile banking system after agreeing to pump $ 5bn of taxpayers ' money into two failed mid-sized banks while handing their good assets to intesa sanpaolo , the country 's strongest lender . 
  pier carlo padoan , italy 's economy minister , said on sunday that the state would offer additional guarantees of up to $ 12bn -- meaning a possible total of $ 17bn -- to cover losses from the two banks ' bad loans . 
  he said the initial $ 5.2 bn included $ 4.8 bn for intesa to maintain its capital ratios following the acquisition of the veneto banks , as well as a further $ 400m in guarantees against the risk that some of the credits acquired by intesa turn sour . 
  italy 's financial system has already put $ 3.5 bn into the veneto banks in the past year via the government-sponsored backstop fund atlante . 
  the government decided to wind down veneto banca and banca popolare di vicenza , based in the country 's prosperous industrial north-eastern veneto region , after the european central bank said they were failing on friday . 
  paolo gentiloni , italy 's prime minister , said the intervention was `` important , urgent and necessary '' to prevent a `` disorderly failure '' of the two banks .
