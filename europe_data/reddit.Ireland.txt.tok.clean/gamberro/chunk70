  the move by italian authorities , which spent the weekend frantically drawing up the complicated decree , will in effect mean that the veneto banks ' branches and employees will be part of intesa sanpaolo by monday morning , a move considered crucial to avoid a deposit run , say people briefed on the discussions . 
  the decree still needs to be voted into law by parliament within 60 days . 
  the drawn-out handling of the veneto crisis has wider implications for europe 's banking union , which aims to integrate oversight of eurozone lenders partly based on the assumption that private creditors would cover bank failure costs , rather than taxpayers . 
  the italian state intervention to protect senior bondholders and big depositors runs counter to that principle but has been allowed because the banks ' liquidation means there are no competition issues . 
  late on sunday the european commission approved italy 's plan to inject state funds on the grounds that it would otherwise disproportionately hurt the regional economy . 
  margrethe vestager , eu competition commissioner , said : `` italy considers that state aid is necessary to avoid an economic disturbance in the veneto region . '' around $ 4bn in shareholder equity and $ 1.2 bn in junior debt will be kept in the liquidated bank and wiped out , as is required under state aid rules . 
  retail investors missold around $ 200m of junior bonds are expected to be compensated . 
  germany has long been concerned at italy 's unwillingness to address banking problems and apply bail-in rules , as well as its attempts to sidestep curbs on state aid . 
  eu officials defended the decision as working within banking union rules , pointing out that it was the single resolution board that decided there was no public interest in resolving the banks . 
  the commission said the decision had taken around $ 18bn of bad loans out of the italian banking sector and contributed to consolidation of the industry . 
  the italian move comes just weeks after spain 's banco popular avoided being wound down after a rescue from larger rival santander . 
  italy has already closed four small lenders and is undertaking a precautionary recapitalisation of monte dei paschi di siena , italy 's fourth-largest bank by assets , since the ecb took over banking supervision . 
  carlo messina , intesa 's chief executive , said the deal was the only `` significant offer '' the government received . 
  he added that without it , the crisis of the two banks would have had a grave impact on the entire italian financial system with dramatic consequences for the italian economy . 
  intesa sanpaolo , italy 's best-capitalised large bank , said last week it was open to purchasing the rump of the good assets for a token price on condition that italy 's government passed a decree agreeing to shoulder the cost of liquidating the lenders ' bad loans , paying for at least 4,000 lay-offs and incurring any legal risks . 
  the future of the veneto banks has hung in the balance over the past two years since ecb regulators uncovered a capital hole caused by a surge in bad loans , which compounded a financial mis-selling scandal . 
  the length of time it has taken for regulators to come to any decision on the banks , which passed european bank health checks in 2014 , has also raised serious questions about their supervision . 
  deposit flight at the banks has accelerated as regulators debated how to proceed , according to people informed on the matter . 
  another midsized regional lender , genoa 's carige , is considered at risk of being wound down if it fails to shore up its balance sheet , say people close to talks with authorities . 
  is it really ? 
  you i realise that the us was torturing people who had never been brought to trial let alone found guilty ? 
  the neocons and coulter under bush were all in favour of it , like trump is today . 
  the fighting in iraq was reduced by us-led counter-insurgency operations , but never went away . 
  some of the most violent and brutal groups like al-qaeda in iraq/islamic state of iraq spread to syria when the country descended into civil war . 
  i think my comment that syria is the mess it is in because of the invasion of iraq is reasonably fair in that sense . 
  we should probably also highlight the huge numbers of refugees from iraq that went to syria initially as a result of the conflict , putting the country under great strain . 
  syria would not be the mess it is if it were n't for the invasion of iraq . 
  the invasion of iraq would never have happened if it were n't for 9/11 . 
  then 9/11 would never have happened if it were n't for the soviet invasion of afghanistan . 
  the soviet union would not have become the superpower that it was post wwii if it had n't been invaded by the germans , so really this whole mess is all the germans fault . 
  we can keep up this line of thinking ad absurdum as the user above is doing , often making quite tenuous leaps to make the point ( france helped saudi arabia seize mecca which was responsible for the partition of india , therefore france is partially responsible for that ) . 
  or we can accept that these people in the middle east and north africa have agency of their own . 
  ** eu 's post-brexit vote unity masks fragile foundations ** * one year on , the mood is upbeat but further integration is on the backburner * 8 hours ago by : alex barker and jim brunsden in brussels how did they do it ? 
  almost exactly a year ago the eu was reeling from a brexit vote that reversed 60 years of expansion and threatened the european project with , in the words of one finance minister , a `` lehman brothers moment '' . 
  fast-forward to june 2017 and those dystopian visions of disintegration have given way in brussels to airy confidence . 
  populists are at bay , the prospect of other countries following britain out of the bloc has receded and a new french president is on the scene , proud to bear an eu flag . 
  `` my concern on june 24 was the contagion effect would be in play and winning out , '' said mario monti , the former eu commissioner and italian premier . 
  `` now it seems to me we can say that rather than a contagion , an antibody effect from brexit prevailed . 
  i for one have been surprised . '' there are many caveats to that conclusion . 
  but the union is clearly relishing some respite from successive years of gruelling crisis . 
  a change of fortune at the ballot box -- in the netherlands , france , spain and austria -- has played a part , as well as europe 's recoil at the politics of donald trump . 
  as eu leaders gather for another summit on thursday , donald tusk , the european council president , described a union `` turning the corner '' with `` newfound optimism '' . 
  alex stubb , the finnish former premier , who warned of that lehman moment , asked : `` who would have thought that france would be the epitome of confident reform and the uk and us the ones running backwards ? '' the unity forged from the trauma of the summer of 2016 has come at a price . 
  diplomats joke in brussels that the eu 's demands over brexit `` promise everything to everyone '' . 
  deciding who bears the cost of compromise has been put off for another day -- as have the political sacrifices needed for further integration . 
  the common front is fragile and expectations are high . 
  as emmanuel macron of france says , it may be `` the last chance '' . 
  ** unity comes first ** it took many months for europe to regain its balance after the brexit shock . 
  but it was thanks in no small part to decisions in the darkest hours after the vote . 
  `` we knew this vote to leave would be potentially cataclysmic , '' said one senior eu official . 
  `` we realised it would be extremely important to show there was a pilot in the plane . '' it was a stunned mr tusk who spoke first for the union on the morning after the vote , saying it was `` not a moment for hysterical reactions '' . 
  a general position had been agreed in calls with eu27 leaders before the referendum : there would be no legal vacuum , unity was paramount , and the benefits of eu membership came with clear obligations . 
  these principles have largely held since . 
  the eu 's goal was to prevent its founding tenets from being picked apart or its common resolve broken . 
  \u00ccn seeking to do so , it fell back on what it knows best : process and structure . 
  no formal talks were permitted before britain activated article 50 , which sets exit negotiation rules that are highly disadvantageous to a departing member state . 
  for all these defensive steps , in the aftermath of the vote some eu leaders still wondered whether britain 's clean break from the eu could still be avoided . 
  angela merkel of germany was one of them , but her view hardened after theresa may 's visit to berlin in july . 
  britain 's new prime minister left the impression that her priority was conservative party unity . 
  ms merkel in turn put eu integrity over and above relations with brexit britain . 
  as she hosted assorted european leaders over august in schloss meseberg , her summer retreat , the message went out : `` let 's stay together '' . 
  `` europe is not a short-term transaction . 
  the brits do n't see that , they never have , '' said senior european official in contact with ms merkel over that summer . 
  `` an integral part of our national interest is the union . '' there was one last factor in the union 's favour : brexit became a vote winner for pro-eu politicians , particularly after mr trump 's election . 
  mark rutte , the dutch premier , memorably road-tested the arguments in the days after the referendum . 
  `` to everyone who thinks it is a good idea to leave the single market , this is what happens , '' he said . 
  `` britain has collapsed -- politically , economically , monetarily and constitutionally . '' ** high demands , high expectations ** if there is a signature feature of the eu 's brexit stance , it is the premium on unity . 
  the negotiating guidelines for michel barnier , the eu 's chief negotiator , allow some space for dealmaking . 
  but there is little restraint in the eu 's headline demands . 
  the sequence for talks -- putting divorce issues before trade discussions -- seeks to minimise discord by making britain pay for harmony . 
  as one eu official remarked to his colleagues , the eu has climbed to the top of the rollercoaster , and now must brace itself for a turbulent ride down . 
  behind the willingness to set such maximalist opening demands is eu confidence in its own leverage , and the economic crunch facing britain . 
  ms merkel told colleagues on the sidelines of the june 2016 summit that `` the markets would bring [ britain ] to the negotiating table '' , according to one person present . 
  the financial hit was not as big as many eu leaders expected . 
  but the logic underpinned a franco-german assessment : there is little to lose by pushing britain hard . 
  uncertainty would force the private sector to prepare , companies to move and brexiters to sober up . 
  it underlines the union 's faith in its bargaining power . 
  `` there is no hiding it , '' said jean-claude piris , former long-serving head of the eu council 's legal service . 
  `` we know we are playing poker with all the aces and kings and [ mrs may ] is playing with the other cards . '' the danger privately acknowledged by some diplomats is of the eu setting unrealistic conditions that may put brexit talks on the path to failure . 
  that goes for an opening gross bid of $ 100bn for the brexit bill -- pushed up to its maximum by eu member states who fear a budget gap -- and demands for total eu legal jurisdiction to protect the rights of 3m migrants in britain . 
  franklin dehousse , a former european judge , criticised it as seeking to make britain `` some kind of new 1930 shanghai '' , where foreign nationals lived under foreign laws . 
  but further eu integration remains an optimistic but unrealised promise . 
  various streams of work have begun in brussels , paris and berlin , from defence co-operation to eurozone and social reform . 
  but to discover what is possible , europe awaits the german election in september . 
  mr stubb sees big decisions on reform approaching . 
  this time there is no british scapegoat and the political circumstances are different . 
  `` there are not many instances in european history where integration has not come with enlargement or a crisis , '' said mr stubb . 
  `` now we are being asked to deepen integration when the eu is not widening but narrowing . '' the coming year may prove testing . 
  `` europeans are now over optimistic for the same reason they were overly pessimistic six months ago : brexit , trump and the populists , '' said pierre vimont , a veteran former french diplomat now at carnegie europe , the international affairs think-tank . 
  `` yet all the problems remain and they may even get more complicated as the brexit talks will at some point challenge the unity of the eu27 , which is largely superficial . '', 
  i 've never seen what the user above describes of a `` left-wing narrative that islam and lgbt are somewhat compatible . '', 
  however , a large part of the left is very much in favour of multiculturalism and at the same time very much in favour of lgbt rights . 
  i think it is fair to question whether being in favour of both is compatible , as many immigrants come from cultures where homosexuality is viewed as an abomination worthy of punishment . 
  ** german minister warns on refugees ' jobs prospects ** * prediction of long-term unemployment as hopes fade of boost to workforce skills * 4 hours ago by : guy chazan in hamburg up to three quarters of germany 's refugees will still be unemployed in five years ' time , according to a government minister , in a stark admission of the challenges the country faces in integrating its huge migrant population . 
  aydan \u00d6zo\u011fuz , commissioner for integration , refugees and integration , told the financial times that only a quarter to a third of the newcomers would enter the labour market over the next five years , and `` for many others we will need up to 10 '' . 
  the admission could prove awkward for angela merkel as she seeks a fourth term as chancellor in bundestag elections this september . 
  ms merkel saw her poll ratings plummet in 2015 when she responded to europe 's gathering refugee crisis by throwing open germany 's borders . 
  the migrant issue no longer dominates the country 's nightly news bulletins , but pollsters say the question of how it will absorb the 1.3 m migrants who have arrived here since the start of 2015 is still one of voters ' key concerns . 
  that explains the continuing popularity of the alternative for germany , an anti-immigrant party that is now represented in 12 of germany 's 16 regional parliaments . 
  the afd 's poll ratings have fallen in recent months but the party is still expected to pick up seats in the bundestag for the first time in this year 's election .
