  initially , the influx of so many working-age , highly-motivated immigrants spurred optimism that they would mitigate germany 's acute skills shortage and solve the demographic crisis posed by its dangerously low birth rate . 
  dieter zetsche , chief executive of carmaker daimler , said the refugees could lay the foundation for the `` next german economic miracle '' . 
  but those hopes have faded as a new realism about the migrants ' lack of qualifications and language skills sinks in . 
  `` there has been a shift in perceptions , '' ms \u00d6zo\u011fuz told the ft. 
  many of the first syrian refugees to arrive in germany were doctors and engineers , but they were succeeded by `` many , many more who lacked skills '' . 
  a recent report by the institute for employment research ( iab ) found that only 45 per cent of syrian refugees in germany have a school-leaving certificate and 23 per cent a college degree . 
  statistics from the federal labour agency show the employment rate among refugees stands at just 17 per cent . 
  it said 484,000 of the refugees are looking for work , up from 322,000 last july -- an increase of 50 per cent . 
  of those , 178,500 are officially unemployed , meaning they not only have no work but are not enrolled in any training programmes or language courses -- up 27 per cent on last july . 
  researchers are noting a slight improvement in the refugees ' employment prospects . 
  a study by the ifo institute found 22 per cent of companies had hired a refugee in the past year compared with just 7 per cent at the end of 2015 . 
  however , they were mainly being employed as interns , support staff and apprentices , with only 8 per cent hired as skilled workers . 
  ms \u00d6zo\u011fuz said the authorities ' main priority was not to find employment for the refugees as soon as possible but to ensure they learnt german and had access to training to acquire the skills needed for an advanced industrial economy . 
  `` in the past , we put people very quickly into jobs where they did n't need to speak , and 40 years later people asked them -- how come you still ca n't speak german ? '' she said . 
  `` we do n't want to repeat that mistake . '' she said authorities had speeded up asylum procedures , so migrants did not have to wait `` years or even decades '' for a decision on their status , and were getting better at recognising foreign professional qualifications so it was easier for refugees to seek employment in germany . 
  bureaucracy continues to be a problem for firms trying to hire refugees . 
  in the ifo survey , 45 per cent of companies said the workers ' residence status was the biggest hurdle while 36 per cent named the long duration of asylum procedures . 
  federal employment agency statistics show that only 6,500 refugees are enrolled in work training programmes . 
  around 12,000 applied but were not awarded a place . 
  ms \u00d6zo\u011fuz insisted that the new immigrants should n't be seen primarily as an economic resource . 
  `` we do n't take in refugees according to their skills set , '' she said . 
  `` the only criteria should be to help people fleeing war and political persecution . '', 
  so it seems that it has happened again . 
  a third terrorist attack in as many months on london 's streets . 
  once again using a vehicle . 
  once again aimed at londoners . 
  except that this time it seems the terrorist himself is not a follower of isis . 
  indeed , reports suggest that the attacker may have been a non-muslim deliberately targeting muslims . 
  on top of whatever other extremist motivations this attacker may have had , he was also unwittingly doing the work of isis and similar groups . 
  for if the attack in finsbury park was indeed aimed at muslim worshippers as they were leaving their mosque then this is exactly the sort of despicable attack that isis would want to happen , to foment discord . 
  our whole nation 's thoughts will be with the injured and the family of the person who has died . 
  those worshippers leaving their mosque who held down the attacker until police arrived on the scene showed special courage and , along with the police , deserve special admiration . 
  of course we now live in an era of the politicisation of absolutely everything . 
  for instance , over the last week the far-left in britain has attempted to claim there is ` blood on the hands ' of theresa may and her government for the terrible tragedy ( which they are labelling ` a crime ' ) at grenfell tower in london . 
  over the weekend they organised protests to demand the resignation of the government and incited already angry citizens to further their political ends . 
  all this with no evidence whatsoever that the conservative government had anything to do with the burning down of a tower-block in london . 
  this is how the remaining civilities of political discourse disappear . 
  now with the attack in finsbury park there will be more of the same . 
  the same people who claim that no further extrapolation should be made from a british muslim carrying out an isis-inspired attack will extrapolate like mad if it turns out that a british non-muslim has done the same thing . 
  yet who would not want there to be as full an investigation as possible into any far-right motivation that may have spurred such an attack ? 
  as with the investigation into the killer of jo cox , who would not want there to be as full an investigation as possible into whether there are others around hoping to do similar acts or people encouraging them to drive vehicles into crowds of innocent people ? 
  all that is needed is some consistency . 
  at present the same people whose response to any act of terror carried out in the name of islam is that everybody should look away , and respond with no more than a chorus of ` do n't look back in anger ' are now pretending that everyone they disagree with has spent years inciting people to drive vans at crowds of londoners . 
  i see that jk rowling is among those pointing the finger at nigel farage . 
  here 's a test . 
  yesterday the annual khomeinist ` al-quds day ' parade took place in london . 
  the march calls for the destruction of the state of israel and in our allegedly zero-tolerance-to-terror city of london supporters of the terrorist group hezbollah openly paraded with the terrorist group 's flags . 
  what twist of popular logic allows that people waving the flags of a terrorist group in london on sunday have no connection with terror , but that a van-driver committing an act of terror later that same day should be blamed on nigel farage ? 
  if it does turn out that sunday evening 's terrorist was a non-muslim deliberately targeting muslims here are some things you will not hear : * nobody will claim that we must rethink our foreign policy to better align itself with the views of the attacker . 
  * nobody will claim that we must carry out an analysis of all other views held by the terrorist , the better to understand ` where he is coming from ' and then act on them . 
  * there will be no talk of ` legitimate grievances ' . 
  * nobody will blame the ` prevent ' programme for the attack or claim that the already existing far-right element of the prevent programme must be completely scrapped or wholly re-thought . 
  more likely is that there will be calls for this element to receive even more resourcing than it currently does . 
  when individuals are committing such illegal acts , i think it 's better that the rule of law is upheld and they are prosecuted ( including being put in prison if necessary ) . 
  ** france opposition likely to come from streets as macron takes control ** * routed rival parties take stock after election hammering * yesterday by : anne-sylvaine chassany in paris france 's established parties faced up on monday to the scale of the task of trying to win back public confidence after being routed in legislative elections that confirmed president emmanuel macron 's dominance of the political landscape . 
  the forces ranged against mr macron will be meagre and the new president will face little or no parliamentary opposition when he seeks to pass far-reaching reforms . 
  voter frustration may quickly ensue and the outcome of the elections will amplify the voices of those on the political extremes and on the streets , political analysts warn . 
  `` this national assembly is not representative of the country 's political forces , '' says luc rouban , a political scientist at cnrs . 
  `` it 's potentially explosive . 
  opposition is likely to express itself outside parliament . '' the centre-left socialist party was humiliated as voters sought revenge after the unpopular presidency of fran\u00e7ois hollande . 
  securing only 44 of the 284 seats it previously held , its secretary-general jean-christophe cambadelis -- who lost his own paris seat -- summed up the party 's grim state of mind on sunday night , saying the party 's demise was `` irrevocable '' . 
  the centre-right republicans and their allies have emerged as the largest opposition group , with 137 seats . 
  but it is a meagre consolation for a tally that is worse than in 1981 , when socialist president fran\u00e7ois mitterrand won the presidency . 
  it is also down from 199 seats in the previous assembly . 
  alain jupp\u00e9 , the mayor of bordeaux , spelt out three challenges facing his party : its attitude towards the government ; the renewal of its leadership ; and its political line . 
  `` it 's not a few lines on a simple blog that will find all the answers in the wake of heavy electoral defeats , '' he wrote . 
  `` let 's take some time . '' while both parties prepare for long inquests , a more immediate question is what kind of opposition they want to provide to mr macron -- with analysts suggesting it will be mild . 
  `` the socialists will be torn between their desire to remain a centre-left party willing to govern and the need to exist as an opposition force , especially with a resurgent populist far-left , '' dominique reynie , head of fondapol , a think-tank , says . 
  `` meanwhile it will be tough for the centre-right not to agree with macron 's jobs bill . '' soul-searching awaits the national front too . 
  marine le pen , its leader and presidential candidate , won a seat in the house for the first time along with seven other fn executives . 
  but the party fell short of the 15 seat threshold to be recognised as a parliamentary group and get speaking time and additional resources . 
  the far-right party is also dealing with internal friction -- chiefly over ms le pen 's choice to campaign on a platform of taking france out of the eurozone , now hailed as one of the main reasons for her failure in the presidential election . 
  `` i would like this debate to take place with courtesy and camaraderie , '' ms le pen said on monday . 
  `` we must ask ourselves the question of what has worked and what has worked less well . '' the clearest opposition force in parliament will probably be jean-luc m\u00e9lenchon 's far-left unbowed france group , according to mr reynie . 
  with 17 mps , it can form a group and mr m\u00e9lenchon , who will sit in the national assembly for the first time , `` will make his voice heard loudly as usual '' , mr reynie says . 
  his voice will be heard on the streets , too , along with that of unions , convinced that the record 57 per cent abstention in legislative elections is evidence of a dormant hostility towards mr macron and his reforms , including a bill intended to make the jobs market more flexible . 
  the president has `` no legitimacy to perpetrate a social coup '' , mr m\u00e9lenchon said on sunday evening . 
  `` i see in this abstention an energy that is available if we know how to use it for our fight . '', 
  what island was that may i ask ? 
  what did the fascists and anarchists do if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  come on , no need for that . 
  this was where niki lauda had his terrible accident , no ? 
   do n't do exercise with 40\u00bac , you are risking your life . 
  so i guess people tend to exercise in the early morning or in the evening , no ? 
  that 's a better theory than what i heard . 
  i heard that it was john f. kennedy who popularised not wearing hats . 
  one of the things that most catches my eye is that most men wore hats back then , whereas hardly any wear them today . 
  ** edit : ** spelling . 
  that 's a nice sentiment on macron 's part , i suppose . 
  but i think we need to accept that they are leaving . 
  oh sorry , i must have missed that . 
   i can imagine there are cities way worse ( ehem america ) . 
  with the exception of major cities like new york , chicago or boston , america is one of the worst places to visit if you are a pedestrian . 
  the distances are simply enormous and in many cities the city centre/downtown areas are eerily quiet at the weekends ( because people go back to the suburbs ) . 
  what 's worse is that many states have turn [ right on red laws ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/turn_on_red ) which i found made crossing the road a nightmare . 
  by the way , i actually have american roots and love the country despite that . 
  out of curiosity , were you out campaigning during the election ? 
  i agree that if they went for another one , they would potentially face a further backlash . 
  also the tory party bringing on such instability would fly in the face of the whole `` strong and stable '' narrative . 
  there are many muslim creationists though .
