  harun yahya is one who makes documentaries `` debunking '' evolution and mails textbooks to schools . 
  then there is the prominent muslim televangelist zakir naik who [ dismisses evolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zakir_naik#biological_evolution ) as `` only a theory . '', 
  that 's one of my favourite clips of ali g. 
  i was there in 2014 and it really is a spectacular place . 
  i found it amazing just how isolated the site is and to think monks were living out there over a thousand years ago . 
  a word of warning though to those who 'd like to visit it though . 
  the steps up there are n't all that safe unfortunately . 
  however , if you take your time , when you get to the top there is [ a great view .

  i notice the ft is referring to just as `` a northern ireland party . '', 
  just wait until it sinks in what kind of party the dup actually is . 
  ** macron surge leaves french far-right wounded in political arena ** polls suggest national front will fail to build momentum in legislative elections yesterday by : michael stothard in aimargues gilbert collard is in a battle for his political future with france 's most famous female bullfighter -- and is in danger of being put to the sword . 
  the 69-year-old national front politician has represented voters in gard , a rural part of southern france , for five years . 
  but polls suggest he will lose sunday 's legislative elections to the candidate of president emmanuel macron : marie sara , a celebrity former torera who counts new-wave film director jean-luc godard as a godparent . 
  the fight in this fn stronghold is emblematic of the way mr macron , with his year-old movement composed in large measure of political neophytes , has shaken up french politics -- and left his far-right opponents , who not so long ago harboured their own ambitions of storming into the elys\u00e9e palace as insurgents , clinging to scant hopes of progress . 
  mr collard , who is wearing thick prada sunglasses and sucking on a pipe in the afternoon sun , is confident that his electors want to send a message of defiance to the new centrist french government : `` i want to fight what he is planning to do this country , '' he says . 
  but on the nearby streets of aimargues many voters say they do not want his brand of opposition . 
  `` i think maybe we should give macron a chance , '' says sylvie allaire , a 41-year-old shop assistant sitting in the little town square . 
  her friend , clara , also in her 40s , said : `` i will vote for macron 's candidate . 
  let 's see what he can do . '' mr collard 's potential loss reflects the broader weakness of the fn , which is beset by doubt and infighting at the same time as mr macron 's republique en marche !, 
  is gathering momentum . 
  an ipsos poll this week showed the fn getting just 17 per cent of the national vote , far behind the 34 per cent they took in the presidential election . 
  this will probably translate into between five and 15 seats in the 577-strong national assembly -- an improvement on the two the fn has today but modest compared to the hundreds of seats it once hoped to capture . 
  it calls into question the claim by marine le pen , the fn 's leader , following the presidential election last month that her party is now france 's main opposition . 
  since the fn 's poor result in the presidential election the party has been beset by infighting , with senior figures exchanging verbal blows about who was to blame . 
  marion mar\u00e9chal-le pen , one of its most influential figures , has said she is quitting politics . 
  one faction is arguing that the party should radically change its political line to embrace the far-right and abandon the statism and anti-euro rhetoric that has defined its strategy since 2011 . 
  with no resolution in sight , the debate rages on . 
  `` it is not going well for the fn in the legislatives , '' says sylvain cr\u00e9pon , professor at paris ouest nanterre university . 
  `` after such a low score in the presidential elections , voters are demotivated and people in the party are turning against each other . '' while the fn grapples with its disappointment , mr macron 's party is going from strength to strength and is expected to win a clear majority in sunday 's elections -- something many analysts thought impossible just a few months ago . 
  mr collard complains about how the legislative election , with a two-round , first-past-the-post system , punishes the fn . 
  the party traditionally comes second in a large number of districts but wins few seats . 
  `` lucky we are a democratic party . 
  or we could ask support to take to the streets , '' says mr collard . 
  but he says he is ultimately resigned to a disappointing outcome on sunday . 
  `` macron will get a big majority , '' he says , adding that there was little chance that the fn could get `` more than 15 '' seats . 
  still , if the fn were to get 15 seats , it would be some kind of victory : that number of seats would mean it could form an official political grouping in the national assembly , allowing it a more active parliamentary role and more financial support . 
  jean-yves camus , a researcher at think-tank fondation jean-jaur\u00e8s , says that 15 seats would be a `` positive step '' for the fn , giving it a base of power going forward . 
  `` if they get five though , it would not be good . 
  there would be a great deal more internal infighting , '' he says . 
  fn supporters are also adjusting their expectations . 
  sophie ardin , a middle-aged former supermarket worker in aimargues who lost her job in march , says that earlier this year she was hopeful ms le pen could have been president . 
  today she will vote fn while accepting that the party will remain far from power and mr macron 's party could deliver a coup de gr\u00e2ce to its rivals in the elections . 
  `` we need people in parliament to fight for ordinary french people against the government , '' she says . 
  `` but i know that macron is going to win big . 
  in the end he is going to be able to do more or less what he likes . '', 
  no , i think they provided the weapons to the ukrainian rebels for military purposes against the ukrainian air force . 
  but then they were used by the rebels to shoot down a civilian airliner . 
  there seems to be a lot of evidence ( such as at bellingcat ) to back up both . 
  what about proposing a new constitution ? 
  i did n't editorialise . 
  it was the title of the article at the time i posted it . 
   because she 's taken her base for granted outside of the daily mail bubble . 
  no surprise there . 
  the daily mail under paul dacre was [ idolizing her . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article35635109.ece/alternates/h342/dailymail.png ) then again she moved closer to the paper too , appointing james slack ( the daily mail 's former political editor ) as her official spokesman . 
  the iberian peninsula , along with many other areas in southern europe , is going to be hit hard by this . 
  it 's pretty frightening . 
  ** edit : ** grammar, 
  why is that ? 
  yeah , there is a strong north-south divide in the [ map of the results ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/italian_referendum_1946_support_for_republic.svg/1200px-italian_referendum_1946_support_for_republic.svg.png ) could somebody elaborate on the reasons for this ? 
  from what i understand the north had been harder hit by the consequences of the war ( more prolonged and greater fascist repression against those hostile to them ) than in the south . 
  like the russian soldiers that volunteer with rebel groups in the donbass while on leave . 
  i do n't know who is downvoting you . 
  i asked as i am interested in this topic ( although i usually just post news articles ) and i am surprised seeing another irish redditor popping up several times on threads about catalonia . 
  i am interested because i lived in spain ( in vallaadolid :p ) for a bit but i am curious as to why other irish users are interested in this . 
  while they do n't use the word `` hate '' , i have seen ** many ** comments by catalan nationalists on social media calling spain a `` pa\u00eds de mierda '' or `` verg\u00fcenza de pa\u00eds . '', 
  i understand catalan nationalists do n't want to live under the same roof ( if you forgive the expression ) and have their own state . 
  but it 's hard not to see those comments as hate . 
  i doubt they would like it if people spoke about catalonia the way they speak about spain . 
  out of curiosity , do you live in catalonia or are you especially interested in this topic ? 
  i 've seen you post on a couple of threads . 
  a new currency you mean ? 
  why ? 
  ah you do n't like the name ? 
  yeah , i 've never heard anybody here ( even czech people i 've met ) refer to it as czechia . 
  ah the old rail and sail ticket . 
  i used to do that when i lived over there . 
  i was surprised just how comfortable it was on the swift ferry over . 
  where abouts do you live now , lad ? 
  you do realise that the uk has higher fertility rates and lower percentage of muslims out of total population than russia , right ? 
   there 's no reason to be concerned any more than usual about the remits of the government . 
  considering the [ surveillance network ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tempora ) the british government has built to spy on its citizens ( which is a pretty massive violation of their rights in my view ) , i think we should be concerned . 
  because with every passing attack , the impetus appears to be to keep the current intelligence services ( including the surveillance network ) in place , or give them even more power . 
  how is that a reason to be concerned about the remits of government ? 
  that does not conform to my stereotype of the place . 
  please move along . 
  that 's exactly it , 80 % of the posts are by tourists/expats on that sub . 
  there are many spanish redditors but i guess you guys prefer going elsewhere . 
  are sites like men\u00e9ame and forocoches still popular by the way ? 
  i assumed that that was where you guys were preferring to spend your time . 
  apart from the trumpkins bombarding your sub , must have some french people on / r/france who are sympathetic to le pen / the fn , no ? 
  at this stage i wonder how much lower turkey can go with regards suppressing press freedom . 
   it was a dnc staffer called seth rich who sent the emails to wikileaks . 
  sorry , you 'll have to try another joke as i 've heard that one before . 
  although the version i heard had hillary having seth rich assassinated for leaking the emails . 
  in the meantime , i am going to follow what the cybersecurity experts say about it , although you probably think i am one of the `` sheeple . '', 
  out of curiosity , did wikileaks do anything in the recent french election ? 
  or what were the events that made you lose respect for wikileaks ? 
  `` goulash communism '' was the milder form of communism in hungary ( compared to the rest of the eastern bloc ) from the 1960s to the fall of the iron curtain .
