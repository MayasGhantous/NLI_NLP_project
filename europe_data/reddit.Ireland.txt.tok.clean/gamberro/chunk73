   the turkish embassy said on wednesday that erdogan 's bodyguards were ** acting in `` self-defense '' ** during the incident and the protesters were affiliated with the terrorist group pkk . 
  they are aware that there is a video of the incident , right ? 
  it clearly shows the bodyguards running towards the protesters and assaulting them . 
  i agree and apologise for my mistake .

  yep , he managed to keep putting it off though and stay on . 
  i ran into his daughter aoibhinn last weekend . 
  i told her she was the spitting image of her father . 
  she was not impressed at all by my comment and said `` you know , normally people say i look like my mother but thanks anyway . '', 
  she stayed clear of me after that one . 
   you want to stop incursion into your airspace ? 
  make sure these jets dont leave your airspace again after doing so . 
  how exactly do you propose greece prevent these airplanes leaving its airspace again ? 
  shooting them down ? 
  the trumpkins , liberating france from the comfort of their basements , one pepe the frog meme at a time ... 
  it 's funny how trump had no hesitation in publicly shaking hands with an authoritarian islamist who locks up his critics and has caused instability in the region . 
  with merkel on the other hand ... 
  is it really ? 
   why are people trying to export such a hateful ideology that would say things like this . 
  because the people exporting this have a supremacist ideology . 
  they really want islam , particularly the salafist version of it , to take over the whole world . 
  many islamists all over the world agree with them or are actively proselytizing to try and achieve the same .

  i do n't follow uk politics enough to know what the deal is with diane abbott . 
  i am well aware that corbyn is not very popular and has been labelled `` unelectable '' many times . 
  but what is the scoop with abbott ? 
  thanks for your reply . 
  how come the us does not have any paid annual leave ? 
  based on the amount of times he appears on fox news , he 's working on it . 
  cool video , thanks for sharing . 
  out of curiosity , did they find the remains of any of the crew members ? 
  indeed . 
  there are a couple of other articles near the top on / r/europe at the moment about that very topic . 
  happy for you guys . 
  they are also codified in a country 's constitution ( generally ) .

  the people over at / r/the _ donald go crazy over malik obama supporting trump . 
  what are you basing that on ? 
  you 're grand lad . 
  no worries . 
  sorry if my comment came across in the wrong way . 
  that is correct . 
  however , there is a policy here about editorialising titles and i prefer not to do that anyway . 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  is this this in the gothic quarter ? 
  or if not where abouts in the city is it ? 
  lumumba was assassinated by the belgian government and the kataganese . 
  the cia had a plot to assassinate lumumba and encouraged him to be eliminated . 
  but it was primarily done by the belgians/katanganese . 
  i 'd recommend the book `` the assasination of patrice lumumba '' if you 're interested . 
  i see . 
  thanks for that . 
  that is indeed a good book and a good introduction to the topic . 
  i actually did a dissertation on the congo free state period once . 
  i 'm curious now as to what those guys were doing in yugoslavia . 
  i know that many africans went to study in the soviet union and the eastern bloc during the cold war . 
  did any go to yugoslavia ? 
  yep , the man who plundered the congo for 3 decades and allowed the country to go to ruin . 
  one of the main reasons for why the congo is in such a pitiful state today is because of him . 
  there are many books and other resources out there if anybody wants to find out more about what happened under him . 
  what explains the fall in support for le pen lately ? 
  this is a pretty significant case with regards the numbers of defendants and charges . 
  it also has parallels to the many other cases of grooming of children by southeast asian gangs in the u.k. , which warrants the article being shared on / r/europe ( in my view ) . 
  ** fading echoes - east germany 's population is shrinking ** * the rest of the country , and large swathes of europe , will face similar problems in future * apr 15th 2017 | bitterfeld-wolfen were it not for the graffiti on abandoned buildings , bitterfeld-wolfen , two towns north of leipzig joined as one in 2007 , would seem devoid of young people . 
  pharmacies , physiotherapy surgeries and shops selling garden gnomes line the sleepy streets . 
  in its heyday the place had a booming chemical industry . 
  today `` the air is much cleaner and we can finally hang out laundry , '' says an elderly local out on a morning stroll . 
  `` but many jobs were lost and so few children are left . '' he points out a building that was once a school ; today it is one of many care homes . 
  despite an influx of 1.2 m refugees over the past two years , germany 's population faces near-irreversible decline . 
  according to predictions from the un in 2015 , two in five germans will be over 60 by 2050 and europe 's oldest country will have shrunk to 75m from 82m . 
  since the 1970s , more germans have been dying than are born . 
  fewer births and longer lives are a problem for most rich countries . 
  but the consequences are more acute for germany , where birth rates are lower than in britain and france . 
  if germany is a warning for others , its eastern part is a warning for its west . 
  if it were still a country , east germany would be the oldest in the world . 
  nearly 30 years after unification the region still suffers the aftershock from the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , when millions -- mostly young , mostly women -- fled for the west . 
  those who remained had record-low birth rates . 
  `` kids not born in the \u201990s , also did n't have kids in the 2010s . 
  it 's the echo of the echo , '' says frank swiaczny from the federal institute for population research , a think-tank in wiesbaden . 
  the east 's population will shrink from 12.5 m in 2016 to 8.7 m by 2060 , according to government statistics . 
  saxony-anhalt , the state to which bitterfeld-wolfen belongs , is ahead of the curve . 
  berlin used to pay little attention to the area . 
  but regional decline has already had a political effect . 
  in a state election in march 2016 , a populist party , the afd , came first in bitterfeld and second in wolfen . 
  such places will matter in a federal election in september , which is expected to be tight . 
  bitterfeld-wolfen has seen its population plummet from 75,000 in 1989 to 40,500 today . 
  even after administrators tore down blocks of flats , and cut floors off others , skeletal remains of buildings still await the wrecking ball . 
  nearly one building in five is empty . 
  a grand stalinist-era construction , once the town 's cultural palace , now stands deserted . 
  two-thirds of kindergartens and over half the schools have closed since 1990 . 
  the number of pupils finishing secondary school has fallen by half . 
  employers struggle to fill vacancies .
