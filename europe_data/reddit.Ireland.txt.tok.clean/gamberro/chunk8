  i also have done a bit of research on the congo free state , so i would n't hold [ the monarchy 's forebears ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leopold_ii_of_belgium ) in very high regard . 
  let 's add to the list the beers and the monarchy . 
  oh , you also had an empire . 
  bring it back , damn it , bring it back !, 
  yes , we understood . 
  but knocking out a country 's power supply can paralyse a country . 
  : s i hope redditors in serbia stay safe . 
  oh and please move away from coal . 
  is it really ? 
  so do people rely mostly on private transport to get around ? 
  the irish love this chart . 
  i think it 's because the eu institutions are located there and money spent maintaining them counts as eu spending . 
  the euro has n't been saved yet , but i thought this was interesting enough anyway . 
   orban did not use the word `` autonomy '' in his speech when speaking about ukraine . 
  true , but orban did speak about the `` right to self-administration . '', 
  is n't that the same thing ? 
  many thanks for your very thorough answer . 
  is n't there a lot of irredentism on the hungarian right for pre-trianon hungary ? 
  how do they view the slovaks/romanians and all the other 's right for self-determination ? 
  it 's an irish way of saying `` i 've just done it . '', 
  it 's a literal translation of an irish language construction that 's still common in the english spoken in ireland . 
  the irish construction is '' * t\u00e1 m\u00e9 tareis a dheanamh ... * '', 
  damn straight . 
  most of the romanians i know here in ireland are sound and very , very well integrated . 
  they even use irish slang like `` i 'm after doing it ! '', 
  as for the romanian gypsies , i think most people are still lost as to why a lot of them can be seen begging on the streets . 
  still , i have n't heard of any cases of criminality from their community here . 
  maybe his argument is that the a federal solution would n't work well given the size of the country . 
  but again , that 's not a very good one . 
  there 's no reason a federal government could n't establish a framework for universal health care through which the states could operate and amend . 
  he 's actually irish but he provides the commentary for the bbc version of eurovision . 
   a third series of seminars was devoted to the problem of ` falsification of history ' , particularly the european tendency to * vilify the soviet troops that liberated central europe in the second world war . 
  * i do n't know where to start with that . 
  it 's depressing that nonsense is getting presented as fact anywhere in the world . 
  but it 's appalling when [ serious war crimes are glossed over or dismissed . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_war_crimes ), 
  can i ask is this directly paid for by the state , by the nashi movement or a some other entity ( possibly an oligarch ) ? 
  this must be very expensive to organise and since it says they stay for free , i 'm lost as to how it 's financed . 
   hungary is already facing scrutiny over the disbursement of eu funding , which accounts for more than * 95 percent of all infrastructure-development financing . 
  * can a hungarian person confirm if that is the case ? 
  if it is , then i am surprised by orban 's somewhat hostile attitude to the eu . 
  fifa really must laugh all the the way to the bank . 
  the host country ends up paying for the stadiums/infrastructure , yet fifa fly in and keep all if the profits . 
  what 's worse , they do n't just insist that stadiums meet health and safety standards , but frequently demand that new stadiums are built . 
  brazil has plenty of stadiums , but fifa has demanded they build 12 . 
  where did you come across these books ? 
  very well put . 
  reading your post makes me wonder just how influential/popular dugin 's ideas really are . 
  also i want to forestall the whataboutism that always comes up whenever russian foreign policy is mentioned . 
  no , the united states ( nor it 's people ) does n't have a right to decide what its neighbours can and ca n't do . 
  pretty much . 
  every newspaper is biased and journalistically , tabloids are crap . 
  but the daily mail goes the extra mile to reinforce the prejudices of the suburban middle class , frequently [ publishing things that are n't even true . 
  ] ( http://britishinfluence.org/13-reasons-taking-daily-mail-press-complaints-commission/ ), 
  how exactly can the presidential elections be held now that parts of the country are under the effective control of separatists ? 
  if putin were sincere about his support he would have supported them a long time ago . 
   he said the vote would decide nothing unless the rights of `` all citizens '' were protected . 
  it seems like putin has n't given up at all , but has set up a test that the upcoming elections are destined to fail . 
  any one in particular that you would recommend ? 
  ** ireland ** as a proud irishman , i am supposed to say * ulysses * by james joyce as many consider it to be ireland 's gift to the english language . 
  but i do n't really like joyce and i think somebody who is n't familiar with ireland would find it hard to get through . 
  so my recommendation is : * angela 's ashes * by frank mccourt . 
  it captures the reality of the poverty and everyday speech of ireland in the early 20th century very well . 
  must we repeat nigel farage 's remarks ? 
  for a man who promotes the idea of the uk `` getting on with our neighbours '' while outside the eu , his remarks insulting the neighbours and their former prime ministers clearly show the opposite . 
  supporting regional languages might challenge the french model of nation-state , with a single unifying language and culture . 
  this whole model has been based on suppressing regional languages ( often derided as * patois * when they are in fact languages like basque/breton ) in favour of french . 
  protecting regional cultures does n't have to have political connotations of any kind . 
  have a look at galicia and valencia in spain that have their own languages but very little support for separatism/independence . 
  i do n't think so . 
  if abortion is commonplace in russia , i doubt it 's that polemical or at least draws people 's attention when they criticise the rest of europe . 
  why all the references to abortion in this map ? 
  according to wikipedia , russia has the highest number of abortions per woman of child-bearing age in the world . 
  ** edit ** [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abortion_in_russia ), 
  there are lots of independents and candidates from other left-wing parties in ireland that share a similar economic perspective as sinn f\u00e9in . 
  you 're entitled to vote for whoever you choose , but there are other options out there . 
  apart from eurobonds , which ones is merkel blocking specifically ? 
  voice of russia really is a mouthpiece for pretty strange propaganda . 
  [ this article ] ( http://voiceofrussia.com/radio_broadcast/25298789/271848828/ ) from the other day shows you what i mean . 
  on top of this disgraceful agreement , [ churchill also had a recurring idea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:duitslandchurchill.png ) of lumping you guys together with the austrians again , along with southern germany . 
  not a language i speak very well , but there are the [ different dialects of irish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_language#dialects ) that should be remembered . 
  i wonder how easily an irish speaker from kerry would understand somebody from donegal . 
  [ this is pretty relevant too ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberum_veto ) ( at least it explains why the polish parliament was so chaotic . ), 
   '' ... in order to hold a referendum on may 11 . '', 
  how likely is it that they 'll be able to hold one in the first place ? 
  what will happen if they do manage to hold one ? 
  about 15 from the republic of ireland and another 26 from northern ireland . 
  damn straight !, 
  nope . 
  actually , i was looking up irish who served in the battle of britain and stumbled upon that . 
  there are a couple of new books out on the irish who served in the british army in wwii . 
  do n't worry at all . 
  in the end , i decided to try and get the bit of karma on / r/unitedkingdom . 
  hehe . 
  i did n't mean this to be a political statement of any kind , as it 's just an interesting fact . 
  in any case , somebody should post this on / r/unitedkingdom for a sneaky bit of karma . 
  ** edit ** if you 're curious about other nationalities who served , [ here 's a link . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-british_personnel_in_the_raf_during_the_battle_of_britain ) ** edit 2 ** i just got sent [ this link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1ypj5i/is_it_true_that_the_polish_had_some_of_the_best/ ) from / r/askhistorians . 
  it provides a pretty good write-up of this topic . 
  that 's a good question and i 'd love to hear an answer from a spanish person .
