  it 's worth remembering though that * gitanos * have lived in spain for centuries and no longer speak romani , but rather a dialect of andalusian spanish with romani loanwords . 
  for example , instead of saying * furgoneta * , they would say * fragoneta * . 
  damn !, 
  for a second there i thought you guys actually traded in lions . 
  that would be epic to say the least !, 
  claiming persecution or bias has worked well for ukip so far . 
  media outlets do n't like the accusation of bias , so just to prove their not , they have given ukip more airtime than they otherwise would have . 
  you 're welcome . 
  i would have a lot more respect for them if they were abstentionist . 
  some nationalist parties in northern ireland ( like sinn f\u00e9in ) get elected on an abstentionist platform and never take their seats in westminster as a result . 
  you can disagree with the abstentionist platform , but ca n't disagree about it being the people 's choice . 
  ** edit ** i should add that the term nationalist means something different in n. ireland . 
  basically , it means that these are the parties in favour of unification with the republic of ireland , as opposed to the unionists who are in favour of maintaining the link with the uk . 
  because i lived in spain for a while and the guys i played football with called me that ( i know it 's a little disrespectful but it was meant as a joke ) . 
  jeez , that 'd be about 10 percent of the population of my country . 
  : / everybody should pay attention to that . 
  out of curiosity , do you live in the uk ? 
  character assassinations ? 
  nigel farage has been on * question time * twenty six times and is constantly on the airwaves in the uk . 
  this is despite the fact that he represents a third party that does n't have any representation in the national parliament . 
  if anything the media ca n't get enough of him and are not trying to `` assassinate his character '' . 
  scrutinising his policies and private life , however , is part of their job . 
  but the fact that people are claiming character assassination is interesting . 
  one of the reasons why farage is the darling of the media is that he accuses all of them of bias against him and his party . 
  so in order to prove they are not biased , they have to dedicate even more airwave time to these guys . 
  they are in favour of placing a limit on the the number of immigrants who come ( they mention a 30,000-50 ,000 figure ) , whether they are skilled or unskilled . 
  so they are opposed to the free movement of skilled labour as well . 
  they are also not really in favour of this limited number of immigrants coming from the eu . 
  just yesterday farage spoke in favour of letting more immigrants in from new zealand , canada and australia that they ca n't let in because of eu membership . 
  the issue is n't that his wife is german and lives in the uk . 
  you 're right in that she 's be there regardless of the eu . 
  but i think people object to the fact that he employs his spouse with public money in the first place . 
  secondly , ukip is putting up billboards that say that eu migrants ( skilled or unskilled ) are threatening to take british jobs . 
  yet here his wife is doing a job that a british person could do . 
   elected national governments must have much greater flexibility to tax and spend as they please . 
  that might sound good but who will guarantee such spending ? 
  also if member states can spend as much as they please , how can they default without having to abandon the euro ? 
  it 's hard to see a change of course , even if governments on the periphery would like one . 
  most of them are too afraid of abandoning the euro , taking a massive hit to their economy and getting kicked out of the eu . 
  secondly , most of them have to promote ( publicly at least ) that they are making the right decisions to restore the economy . 
  the way i see it , any change of course would have to come from germany , although it may be triggered by events elsewhere . 
  greece needing another bailout ( and possibly even another one after that ) might force a change of some kind . 
  but what kind of change is yet to be seen . 
  out of curiosity , what do you think the party will do after the 2017 referendum ? 
  i agree . 
  the article seems to predict violent out ones from this situation over other ones . 
  based on the experience of irish independence , catalan representatives in spain 's national parliament still have the option of abstentionism amongst other things . 
  this does not have to end in violence and quite frankly i do n't think it will . 
  i think you 're referring to [ this video . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qdyosgbivy ), 
  jeez , i just [ googled it . 
  ] ( http://www.frontnational.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/unis.jpg ) this seems to be consistent with the rest of their propaganda . 
  the fn like to portray le pen as a modern day joan of arc , destined to `` save '' france and whatnot . 
  what king was it that you guys shared ? 
  this . 
  i do n't think our government made any special effort to ensure integration , so the fact that they have fitted in so well is a pretty big testament to the polish community . 
  while not being religious myself , i think the fact that polish people are catholic helps as well . 
  so you 're saying it does n't matter if the 75 percent figure is untrue ? 
  it 's getting posted on billboards , so i 'd say it does matter that the facts are n't straight . 
  ** edit ** also read the article linked about what kind of legislation comes from brussels and how difficult it is to gauge its magnitude . 
  thanks !, 
  i have changed the original figure i claimed to coincide with a more accurate interpretation of the facts . 
  i also admit to my mistake and apologise for that . 
  firstly , ukip is the one making the untrue claim of 75 percent over and over again , with the very deliberate purpose of [ portraying domination by brussels . 
  ] ( http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/uk-news/2014/04/21/farage-defends-ukip-poster-campaign/ ) it 's hard to deny that . 
  secondly , what kind of political party that wants to be taken seriously cites a speech as in this case ? 
  no offence to [ mr. herzog and mr. hartenbach ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmk-f88gcx8 ) but politicians are known to make up statistics . 
  thirdly , the fact that legislation comes from brussels does n't mean that british representatives do n't have a say on it in the council and the parliament . 
  yes , it does . 
   the independent house of commons library found just 9 per cent of statutory instruments passed in the uk parliament between 1998-2005 were implementing european legislation . 
  perhaps there are other facts that need to be taken into account that push the figure upwards from 9 percent . 
  but claiming 75 percent comes from the eu is clearly an exaggeration . 
  well they like to cite facts over and over again that are n't even true . 
  the real cost of britain 's membership of the eu is about [ 20-33 million a day ] ( https://fullfact.org/economy/cost_eu_membership_gross_net_contribution-30887 ) . 
  that works out at less than a pound per person . 
  another favourite of farage is that 75 percent of the uk 's laws come from brussels . 
  the true figure is about [ 40 to 50 percent . 
  ] ( http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/is-most-of-the-uks-law-made-in-brussels/1498 ) in a democracy they have a right to oppose the eu if they so choose , but the least they can do is base their argument on facts . 
  ** edit ** corrected figures . 
  can anybody post the article ? 
  i got hit by a paywall . 
  despite farage coming across as smooth talking and being the darling of the media , ukip tends to attract pretty strange types . 
  an old teacher from my school is now [ farage 's , or more precisely the efd 's , spin doctor . 
  ] ( http://politicalscrapbook.net/2013/11/hermann-kelly-calls-mep-euroslave-twat-on-twitter-rebecca-taylor/ ) the guy was a complete nut job . 
  he was a religious fundamentalist who instead of teaching us science , used class time to preach his views on abortion and homosexuality . 
  not only that , he put up anti-abortion posters in our school and told us in class that homosexuality was `` unnatural . '', 
  yet here he is pretty high up in ukip and has n't changed his views since . 
  what i ca n't understand is that with idiots like him working for the party and with [ far-right allies in the parliament , ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/03/11/ukip-european-parliament_n_4940247.html ) the media still take ukip seriously . 
  this . 
  he also spent this money on promoting his own anti-capitalist views , not on giving it to ngos or to help people who are really suffering at the moment . 
  immigration or illegal immigration seems to attract a bit of a `` hive mind '' as you say . 
  but every subreddit will attract people with a certain interest or views , although those views are n't always the same . 
  in my opinion , / r/europe fluctuates from day to day , from being pro-eu to quite europhobic . 
  roast lamb for most irish people , so i 'm afraid it 's nothing too exotic . 
  some people might eat fish as well , such as salmon . 
  when i was in spain they ate french toast coated with sugar called [ * torrijas * . 
  ] ( http://discoveringspanishculture.blogspot.ie/2011/08/torrijas.html ) it was quite nice . 
  technically , the socialist party sit with the gue/ngl . 
  sinn f\u00e9in sit with them as well , although you can guess my stance about voting for them . 
  no need to apologise and happy easter to you .
