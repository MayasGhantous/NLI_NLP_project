  we would have to close the border . 
  that 's the understanding i came to as well . 
  no better feeling than getting off a plane and walking straight through security . 
  it would be nice if we would both join the schengen agreement . 
  while it would be in the interest of the irish government , i ca n't see the uk joining along . 
  if we agree , it has to be done together or else it would cause massive logistical problems on the north south border . 
  was going to say that there should be a circle around the uk and ireland but i just found out that while there is free travel between the uk and ireland , there is no official agreement . 
  you learn something new everyday . 
  while people do have legitimate concerns over the scope of the filter and what it might lead to in the future , i think a lot of people seem to be misinformed on the issue . 
  several people on the other thread for the opinion piece from the guardian were under the impression that the british government had implemented a mass censorship on british web traffic . 
  i love the way the four courts look in the picture i have above . 
  judging by the buses , it 's quite an old picture , but it looks awesome . 
  perfect angle for showing off what makes dublin beautiful . 
  the financial centre looks great . 
  that whole area down by the [ grand canal theatre ] ( http://www.arup.com/~/media/images/countries/ireland/ireland_grand_canal_962x395.ashx?h=395&amp;w=962 ) has come on a lot . 
  very similar to [ dublin ] ( http://shayfarrelly.com/wp-content/gallery/dublin-skyline/dublinskyline-7077_111107.jpg ) . 
  a low skyline across the city . 
  obviously going to big-up my own . 
  [ dublin , ireland ] ( http://www.1000lonelyplaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dublinriverliffey.jpg ) . 
  a fantastic low skyline city . 
  no , not biased at all , 
  love the castle up on the rock . 
  first time i went to edinburgh we sat in a starbucks at the base of the hill , looking up at it while we enjoyed our coffee . 
  it 's still a filter that you can decide if you want it or not . 
  if you 're unhappy with the wide range of websites targeted under the filter and instead want to block content yourself , then you can . 
  at any point , after requesting for the filter to be used , you can get the filter removed by contacting the isp . 
  i agree with you in a certain respect . 
  we do n't want it developing to such a stage where there internet , in general , has the same sort of wide ranging filter applied . 
  in so far as everyone in a particular country is effected . 
  took two looks , but i understand what your point was . 
  i do n't think you understand . 
  it 's not some giant filter on all uk residents . 
  it 's a parental control filter that you must either accept or reject when you set up a new connection with your isp . 
  what they 're trying to do is to force isps to let new customers know that they can apply a filter if they wish . 
  i do n't really have a huge problem with this . 
  what i do have a problem with is a ) the wide reaching range of websites targeted and b ) the fact that the information of whoever declines to apply the filter will be more than likely be on some sort of list . 
  definitely an interesting way of presenting the question . 
  the yes box is also bigger than the no one . 
  they are asked a yes/no question just like any other additional service that an isp might ask you if you 're interested it . 
  http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/71795000/jpg/_71795679_71795678.jpg existing customers will not have the filter applied . 
  it only applies to new customers . 
   why should a government have to apply it to a whole country for some very idiotic few . 
  they 're hardly applying it `` to a whole country '' . 
  what 's different with this compared to the filters that have always been available from your isp is that it is a question as opposed to something you have to query about yourself . 
  [ the question for new connections ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/71795000/jpg/_71795679_71795678.jpg ), 
  it 's not as bad as i thought it would be . 
  it is n't a pre ticked box or anything . 
  it is a yes or no question . 
  is it really an `` opt out '' filter though ? 
  from this [ image ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/71795000/jpg/_71795679_71795678.jpg ) it is n't exactly what i was lead to believe it was previously . 
  it 's not like it 's applied without your knowledge . 
  you 're asked , when you sign up as a new customer , whether on not you want the filter applied to your account . 
  i 'm confused . 
  is that quote in relation to a completely separate order or is it in relation to the optional filter . 
  what i take from that , is that it 's up to the isp to decide what is blocked under the optional parental controls , as opposed to a blanket agreement that isps can blocked whatever they want for all of their customers . 
  after seeing that first image , i 'm surprised at how blown out of proportion this story is . 
  if that 's the actual message that has to be displayed because of `` cameron 's internet porn filter '' , then i do n't see what the problem is , so long as the ability to decide remains . 
  quick question . 
  not sure if you know but is the box already ticked or do you have to actually tick the box if you want the filter ? 
  just want to know if it 's possible that people would have the filter applied unknowingly . 
  we 're getting two new boats too !, 
  ... and then decommissioning two . 
  while we 're on the topic of military might , check out these [ bad boys !, 
  ] ( http://www.military.ie/uploads/tx_templavoila/home_air_corps_trg_707.jpg ) who needs eurofighters when you 've got a couple of these at hand ... 
  we have 7 boats !, 
  yay !, 
  and the one that claimed ireland was in the uk ? ... 
  and the one who mixed up scotland and ireland . 
  ( actually scotland , if you want to move , we 'd be happy to . 
  i hear you have a lot of the black stuff ... and i 'm not talking guinness ! ), 
  i was pretty happy at how ireland was remembered ( as well as the difference between ireland and northern ireland ) but the one with `` the uk '' written right across the ireland and great britain really hurt . 
  have to admit , i would love polish neighbours . 
  great bunch altogether , 
  nawww love you too , buddy !, 
  oh i know that and i know how it feels . 
  what i like to say to myself is , removing yourself from the equation will do no good . 
  the french are n't alone in that resect . 
  unless the issue is extremely emotively lead , the vast majority of people here in ireland just do n't want to hear about it . 
  people have just completely removed themselves from political discussion . 
  have to say i was surprised by the estonian rank . 
  it 's the first thing i noticed . 
  very happy with our results . 
  no matter how well we market our capital city as the `` internet capital of europe '' or our country as the home of pharmaceuticals and medical devices , we need to back this marketing up with facts . 
  now , unfortunately , it 's about trying to keep this generation at home and not having them emigrate . 
  my comment was n't a quip at germans . 
  i was merely commenting on a video from germany that i find it hard to grasp that a shop would be happy to allow such a carry on . 
  if it was a video from the uk , i would have addressed it in a similar fashion . 
  this should n't be allowed to happen . 
  stores should be forced to sell highly sought after products like this through preorders , instead of letting the person that is cruel enough to rip it out of someone elses hands , purchase it . 
  pretty sure that would n't be allowed here . 
  seems really silly . 
  if you want a console , then preorder it . 
  do germans not understand the concept of pre orders ? 
  ca n't believe shops actually condone this sort of behaviour . 
  there 's a clip in there where a guy who got one is pinned to the ground and someone just comes along and yanks it out of his hands . 
  they 've got knights in russia on horses with lush dvid bowie style hair ? 
  i want in on that !, 
  hopefully it makes a big difference . 
  it 's supposed to be disgusting . 
  if i had my way i would have it the [ same as australia ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/08/article-2449731-0f02d36c00000578-830_634x356.jpg ) where the who packet it covered and there is no branding ( and that 's what my government campaigned for , but obviously the lobbying for the big cigarette companies managed to stem the adjustments ) .
