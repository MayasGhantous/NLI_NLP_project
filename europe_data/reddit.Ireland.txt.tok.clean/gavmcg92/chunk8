  not if you 're from the republic , 
  is the census done on the whole island or is the info for the north taken from their one ? 
  188 a week here in ireland . 
  150 a month seems incredibly low . 
  you would probably find that it would reduce defence costs with bulk orders being made , making it a lot easier for smaller nations to get what they need . 
  why spend a lot of money on air defence when we have an incredibly large air force to our east that we spend little to no money on ? 
  what ireland needs to invest in is our navy . 
  as an island nation a long the west coast of europe , we need a larger fleet to counter fishing violations and drug trafficking . 
  reminds me of the eurovision ... 
  molly last year was great . 
  have a feeling that you guys just do n't get the votes regardless . 
  first a comet and now australia !, 
  woop woop !, 
  he 's right . 
  there 's more to our 12 points to latvia than just latvians voting . 
  from | to | jurya | juryb | juryc | juryd | jurye | rank | televote | combined | points -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- ireland | latvia | 15th | 1st | 1st | 1st | 3rd | 2nd | 3rd | 1st | 12 source : http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=2083#scoreboard, 
  that 's exactly why san marino is jury only . 
  too easy to influence the result . 
  you 're welcome !, 
   latvian song was surprisingly good this year . 
  ehh no thanks !, 
  the system is on the right track . 
  they just need to get rid of the jury ranking system and only allow them to pick their top 10 acts . 
  they 've said that they will discuss the reasons when they have their meeting in june . 
  back of the line aussie !, 
  we 've been waiting far too long to get thir show back in ireland . 
  we 'll take some too  you know , just for the laugh . 
  we 'll use it for another 20 + years and then pawn it off to malta . 
  two that come to mind are intel and pfizer . 
  was great for christmas booze shopping a few years back !, 
  it 's like when we fly to the uk . 
  there 's a lane for ireland/channel islands that we just walk through . 
  that might have changed recently but it was like that last year . 
  quite similar to aussie rules , moreso than any other sport . 
  it 's up there with the french as one of my favourites . 
  ... just orientated in different directions . 
  i feel like that 's where the general tone is at here in ireland at the moment . 
  the event is being used as a celebration of what our country has done in it 's short life . 
  not to mention the fact that a royal has been invited to the celebrations . 
  saw a pre roll ad for this on youtube . 
  cheers . 
  a nice , quirky video has been released too which details the history of the easter rising . 
  a [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cew_zlgi3cc ) with photos and footage from the easter rising if you 're interested . 
  sounds like the notes on my grades cards from primary school . 
  ehem ... 
  i do believe we 're first in line !, 
  oh god i was expecting [ this !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqjvgegalma ), 
  `` not in euro2016 '' lol !, 
  never forget the guy showing off his biceps in the north east . 
  that sounds oddly familiar . 
  like 800 years familiar ... 
  according to the news it was warned several times as it approached turkish airspace . 
  jets were scrambled when it got within a few miles . 
  seems like it would have been shot at when it passed through . 
  i like your thinking !, 
  you can expect your ehem ... * guinness * job offer shortly . 
  that 's blasphemy !, 
  that stuffs for drinking . 
  fantastic cover for our secret nuclear program . 
  it 's always the russians ... never the sweet irish neighbours . 
  a man can dream , ca n't he ? 
  those figures are from 2013 no ? 
  * ireland ftfy, 
   the reported 100 hostages inside the bataclan are being slaughtered one by one with a shotgun for over an hour , according to various reports . 
  you can only imagine the scenes in that room . 
  thoughts go out to the families . 
  there 's also a lot of young people who only support abortion for fatal foetal abnormalities and other limited circumstances . 
  legislating for x will be the only thing we 'll see on this for 5 + years . 
  in fairness , there 's a large likelihood that they will be back in power . 
  i would disagree with that second paragraph . 
  we 're still quite conservative on the abortion issue . 
  you 're only going to see a majority of support for abortion in a limited set of circumstances as opposed to free and open access . 
  in fairness , we 're coming on leaps and bounds in a very short time . 
  completely agree . 
  it has been great seeing the cooperation between the several nations who are apart of the nordic front . 
  house prices and rent are too damn high !, 
  the vast majority are in one building too as far as i am aware . 
  i would say most of them will go when the double irish is closed . 
  however the likes of google , apple , amazon , airbnb are more than just names on a wall . 
  they have significant work forces that are ever growing . 
  pretty impressive set ups too . 
  would love to be in iceland right now !, 
  yes i would say so . 
  take a look at the video huffington post put up . 
  i think it 's called 24 hours in dublin . 
  to take over ? 
  to capitalise on impact ? 
  yes . 
  strong , well skilled work force , close to london , english speaking , in the eu and a competitive tax policy . 
  i would say dublin is at the top of a lot of lists . 
  if they want to operate within the eu then they will need to be based within the eu . 
  oh i certainly agree and that 's why we need to grab hold of this opportunity and start making changes . 
  for a start building size limits need to relaxed down by the docks to allow for adaquate office space to be built . 
  there 's more to it than what you have listed . 
  as far as i am aware , if london loses its eu `` passport '' then a lot of financial institutions will be forced to move their operations to another eu financial hub . 
  dublin will be up there as well for a lot of them . 
  morgan stanley seem to be looking ( even if they publicly are denying it ) . 
  we would be foolish here if we did n't take advantage of brexit and try to entice some banks/investment firms over . 
  can someone tell me what the fuck the uk jury were on when they were casting their votes ?
