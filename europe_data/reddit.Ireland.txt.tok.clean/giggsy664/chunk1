we 've had this in place for about 10 years !, 
  when it was city of culture , it was derry/londonderry, 
  no , gards are n't allowed into ni without special permission and vice versa , read the last few lines of [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_of_adrian_donohoe#shooting_and_robbery ), 
  that english ussr anthem is great, 
  and we 're english speaking , have good infrastructure , and a highly-skilled population . 
  if it was just on corporation tax why are n't all the companies in [ estonia , montenegro , albania , bosnia & herzegovina , bulgaria or macedonia ? ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_rates_of_europe ) . 
  granted corporation tax is probably the main reason, 
   voting is always skewed by geopolitics geopolitical voting ? 
  in * my * eurovision ? 
  well i never ... 
  wiki for eurovision 2013 : turkey -- on 14 december 2012 , the turkish broadcaster t\u00fcrkiye radyo ve televizyon kurumu ( trt ) announced their withdrawal from the contest , citing dissatisfaction with the introduction of a mixed jury/televote voting system and the current status of the `` big five '' . 
  [ 16 ] this ended with that turkey created their own singing competition called `` t\u00fcrkvizyon song contest '' , which starts in december 2013 . 
  they 're in the [ european broadcasting union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_broadcasting_union ) and as such can participate . 
  morocco entered once , and azerbaijan won it 3 years ago . 
  very very few youth attend mass every week though , it is the elderly propping up the churches numbers . 
  neither does ireland really , lots of people are still `` catholic '' cos they never officially left the church , and the mammy 's still put everyone down as catholic on the census . 
  it has ireland as protestant !, 
  i ca n't even begin to explain why that 's wrong . 
  north co dublin monnnnnn, 
  they do , they 're really impactful when you see them at 7pm eating your dinner like, 
  these are easily my least favourite ads yet they have had such a huge impact on me . 
  oh right , there was lots of `` austria '' in the preceding paragraphs and then all of a sudden the aussies appeared, 
  at the start of the 5th paragraph should it be austria instead of australia ? 
  was a poor attempt at humour :( second part was a bit more serious though, 
  ze germans vill be gone soon and zey will not be able to do anyzing anymore , hehehe in all seriousness , have the govt learned their lesson ? 
  will they be able to make sure we do n't fuck up again ? 
  ** ireland ** emmmmm ... 
  very little happened . 
  * we 're exiting the bailout soon * we beat the football powerhouse that is latvia 3-0 , which means everyone will be disappointed when we turn to shite during our next match . 
  robbie keane is now the joint 15th highest international goalscorer . 
  edit : * the sky was purple a few days ago, 
  oh tis and all !, 
  usually it 's : * something happened with the church * something happened with the govt/enda oh yeah ming 's bill was shot down and enda said he likes gays !, 
  ** ireland ** i honestly do n't know what happened this week . 
  there 's been nothing of note . 
  do n't think all the games on the last weekend of nov will be called off , i know both nantes and guingamp are n't in favour of the strike and they are scheduled to play each other that weekend, 
  oh of course yeah , sorry , shows my lack of gaeilge, 
  funnily enough the irish word for a drink is \u00f3l , which is very similar to the scandinavian and baltic word for beer, 
  in ireland taxes are taken from your pay by your employer , you pay as you earn ( paye ) . 
  say tax is 40 % and you earn $ 1000 in a week , you never see $ 400 of that , you receive $ 600 . 
  i presume in switzerland , if tax is 40 % and you earn chf 1000 a week , your employer gives you 1000chf and it 's up to you to make sure you set aside 400 chf a week to pay your tax bill . 
  it might allow for lower taxes ( net ) as you can earn interest on the 400 chf perhaps, 
  irish , was in oslo at the end of august , picked up some koskenkorva salmiakki on the way back , loved it , recently found a shop that sells the sweets !, 
  i do now . 
  we do n't have them in ireland , and in dublin we only have a very small tram system :( i 'd seen them in riga but i did n't know what they were called . 
  the more you know  seriously though sorry for commenting on a 2 month old post, 
  ireland can not :( ireland can however into ripping up tram lines in the 1940s and then rebuilding some shitty ones in the 2000s though !, 
  hooray , it looked nice , though i was only there for a few hours . 
   irresistible to the opposite sex  curse, 
  riga is the capital , there 's a town called ogre in the middle , there 's a town called daugavpils near lithuania , there 's a town called jurmala which is like a summer resort ( ? 
  ) , they are n't going to be using lats in 4 months time . 
  joined eu when ireland had the presidency . 
  latvian people do n't like it if you call them russian , used to be in the ussr , speak latvian , and i do n't know much else i 'm afraid . 
  edit : and they have buses in riga that run off overhead power cables just like trams do , crazy shit, 
  gaelic is actually the family of languages that irish/gaeilge belongs to , alongside manx and scots . 
  saying you want to learn `` gaelic '' is the same as saying you want to learn `` germanic '' . 
  never really thought about it but i do n't think i 've ever heard someone on british/us tv say `` i was after x-ing '' before . 
  and sure when i say `` i was after jumping '' in my head i say it with a country accent . 
  god that 's mad . 
  you 've learned more irish than most people i know , and they 're just finished 13 years of mandatory irish learning in school . 
  g'luck to ya , at least you 've a passion for the language !, 
  picnic is in stradbally , co laois not offaly, 
  9000 people sat hl maths in 2011 , up to 11000 in 2012 and 15000 in 2013 because of the bonus points . 
  shame the sec ca n't make 2 papers without fucking up, 
  admittedly , by my part , a huge lack of enthusiasm . 
  i 've never liked the language so i 've put no effort into it . 
  i 'd just turn up for class and talk to my friend who was the same . 
  in the french syllabus , the emphasis is on being able to give you the capability to basically move to france and live there and be able to integrate and speak the language . 
  with irish , theres very little practical element . 
  there 's a lot of poetry and prose you 've to learn about , all in irish . 
  ask any irish teacher and they 'll say the same . 
  with regards to the irish language bit , you 've to learn it for 13 ( thirteen ! ), 
  years unless you get an exemption ( dyslexia , non-irish native , etc ) . 
  i 've just finished these 13 ( in my case , 14 ) years , and my level of irish is horrible . 
  i 've been learning french for 6 years and i feel far more comfortable speaking french . 
  tbh that 's what any irish person will say about the country haha, 
  it 's ... alright ... 
  i suppose, 
  oh you 're irish haha . 
  i did pass too , arsed about all the time and still got a c2 . 
  `` go tobann '' is suddenly i think, 
  for the state exams in irish you 've to write a story . 
  most teachers gave you phrases to learn that would be suitable for any story , and phrases to be able to change the story to something you 'd learnt . 
  i think every story i did involved going somewhere , leaving , `` suddenly , paul was hit by a car '' followed by a trip to a hospital . 
  i really did n't care for the language in school , it 's taught atrociously so i never liked it . 
  the thing with ra songs is they 're very catchy . 
  i like listening to come out ye black and tans because it 's a good song , not because i hate the queen . 
  i went to a snow patrol concert with my friend . 
  it was black with people . 
  the atmosphere was electric . 
  we left the concert and suddenly my friend was hit with a car . 
  lenin spoke english with a rathmines accent . 
  yeah some places had none of the pickpockets , and only a street vendor selling water ( like at the mus\u00e9e d'orsay ) . 
  you 're right about the hidden treasures bit though , i 'd love to go back with someone who knows about the `` real '' best parts of paris . 
  yeah but when you 're only there for 3 days you kinda * have * to do all the touristy things . 
  i 'm definitely gon na go back to paris in the future i 'll just have to avoid certain places , which is a shame . 
  they did the finger rope thing to us at montmartre , they wanted us to give them a note ( like a 20 ) and they 'd give us back 15 but the notes would be fake . 
  paris is a lovely city but the amount of pickpockets/scammers and people trying to sell you shit has really put me off going back for a long time . 
  am i fuck, 
  prepare to win .
