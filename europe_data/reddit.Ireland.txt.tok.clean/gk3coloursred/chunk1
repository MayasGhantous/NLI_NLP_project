and if you do n't want to move to dublin ? 
  while some of mine have returned , myself included , most i do not see returning . 
  some have already bought homes and/or got married in canada , korea , scotland , australia ... etc : - / the lack of jobs may be less of an issue for those in dublin or commutable distances from it , but in the west it 's very much still a problem . 
  ireland . 
  the perception : drunk and fun despite being penniless and out of the fringes of society [ europe ] while angela merkel and her euro-b ( w ) anker buddies screw us over with the assistance of the gobshites we voted in power . 
  the truth ? 
  ok , we like a pint , but the party days are in the past . 
  gone are the days of street parties 5/6/7 nights a week all over town as buskers play to people dancing as swinging off lampposts and climbing fountains . 
  partly this is due to lack of employment/disposable income and partly due to all the youth - particularly the educated youth - leaving in droves . 
  there are few reasons for youths with education and no financial ties to stay if they are n't lucky enough to have one of those rare good jobs . 
  this is despite the fact this was the first generation of irish kids to supposedly never have to leave to find work overseas - the generation which is now #generationemigration . 
  this will have long-lasting consequences for the country as so many of those who left will never return ( to live ) . 
  as for the constantly being f ** ked over ? 
  we 've done all we can , and more , to ease our situation - but our politicians have no balls , and despite us performing so well to try to get out of this hole we keep getting the short straw . 
  particularly riling when we are actually performing well compared to those other countries who were similarly struck but hey , so long as our politicians can do what they want with zero punishment for what at times amounts to financial treason against the state , what chances are there for the average man/woman on the street ? 
  hey , thatso-called 'em pty space ' has lots of ... umm ... errr ... 
  rocks !, 
  yeah ... : - /, 
  ah , because of his support for putin !, 
  i assumed it 'd be because estonians had actually listened to [ his music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uokkl35wivw ) ... 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crnxezjcey4 ), 
  agreed , but on the day the story broke and everyone was talking about it rte will still ignoring it . 
  perhaps , but they are also pretty good at ignoring stories which are uncomfortable to them . 
  such as claiming almost nobody is at protests ( while reporting from an area away from the ammassed crowds ) or utter silence on something the entire nation is talking about - [ such as the septic tank babies scandal ] ( https://medium.com/@gwen_boyle/mass-grave-of-almost-800-babies-is-too-uncomfortable-for-official-ireland-92fd3b41e649 ), 
  plus all those of hungarian origin who would have learnt it as a 2nd language due to the austro-hungarian empire . 
  i 'm intrigued ... 
   scots gaelic does not have a bright future in scotland . 
  read the below link ( from which i take a couple of quotes ) which would disagree with that . 
  scots gaelic may be a lesser-used language , mostly found in the west of scotland , but it 's death ought to be a way off yet . 
  though that said , i speak far better polish than i do scots gaelic ... 
  anyway - link : http://www.newstatesman.com/2014/02/springtime-gaelic  when the latest figures were released in september , naysayers were preparing to sound the knell . 
  but the new total ( 58,000 ) had barely dipped and closer inspection revealed new growth : in every age group under the age of 20 , there had been a rise . 
   there is a gaelic revival under way . 
  increasing numbers of parents -- even those who do n't speak the language -- are opting to send their children to gaelic-medium schools , where all subjects are taught in the language . 
  in 1985 there were only 24 primary school children being taught in gaelic ; last year the figure was 2,953 . 
  sixty-one schools across scotland now offer gaelic-medium education . 
  the expectation is that , as time passes , these young gaels will revitalise a language that is intricately tied up with their country 's identity . 
  just ask them about their home region of mexico/canada ... 
   but having them in the six nations will , in time , perhaps develop rugby as a sport in italy , and they 'll get progressively better . 
  i can say nothing for the development of the sport in italy , but i think they have got much better as a result of playing the best teams in the northern hemisphere every year . 
  in russia army dictate you wear the socks , this russian way [ since 2013 ] ( http://en.ria.ru/military_news/20130114/178772451/russian_army_footwraps_are_out_socks_are_in.html ) . 
  [ so much spent to be the worst at all of those things ? 
  i would find it hilarious if polish were chosen as the language of the eu , mostly because i know just how damn hard it is to learn . 
  all well and good , indeed excellent in theory , but in many cases the methods used for teaching languages are terrible and there would also be a great shortage of suitable/available teachers . 
  i despised french in school due to the shitty teaching techniques , lack of interest , as well as having no belief that i would actually use it in the future . 
  indeed i did n't use it for about 12 years after being able to drop it as a subject in school , and it is only in the last few years i started to use and re-teach myself it after having the drive/desire/need to use it . 
  i now like using french , but no thanks to the educational system . 
  no risk of taking bottom place from the vatican though !, 
  so ... snoop for extra jobs , increased tourism and national trade and greater public spending without hitting peoples pay packets ? 
  sounds good !, 
  so littlegreyclud is going to the land of biggreyclouds ? 
  in quite a few places this happens . 
  i approve tbh , better not to have innocent bystanders get caught up in it . 
  tl ; dr : evil flesh-rotting death-causing s ** t. 
  glad to hear you are trying to learn it , very glad to hear the is a revival in it ( albeit a small revival ) too . 
  i assume you know [ cornish-language . org / ] ( http://www.cornish-language.org/ ) ? 
  also , it 's a long time since i saw cornish mentioned on / r/languagelearning - maybe some people there can help you ? 
  true , but having been in dh for the last 3 weeks i can not understand why ireland and scotland have the bad reputations for rain - nl is just as bad !, 
  it may have only rained once in the first week , but it lasted all week ... 
  and rain . 
  lots of bloody rain . 
  three ? 
  usa , japan and ... ? 
  do kids in the uk playing rounders in pe class count as a third competing nation ? 
  though i have no reason to doubt you , pictures that are distributed all over the press , twitter etc prove nothing ... 
  come to ireland , regularly made here . 
  steak and stout pie !, 
  but the reverse is true too . 
  there could be many people/companies who normally use bicycles but whom have to buy a new car for only occasional usage , such as meeting occasional out of town clients . 
  the stats may seem like there is only a small drop in car usage , but as more people move on two wheels the car is taking a backseat considerably moreso than before . 
  think of it this way : two of the guys from ` predator ' ended up in the us government . 
  not just one , but two !, 
  should leave this video here then ... [ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntya9_6xdfo] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntya9_6xdfo ), 
  typo on ` gnieszno ' , the first capital of poland . 
  edit : dammit , somehow i typo 's while correcting a spelling error & added an 's ' ??? 
  gniezno , i know this , been there several times . 
  beautiful town , terrible for hitchhiking . 
  ah cool , thanks . 
  not up in kildare often , but nice to know . 
  i like polish food - good , wholesome and tasty but when i 'm not in poland chances to get freshly made stuff are few and far between . 
  well , until i start making my own !, 
  thanks to dutch pronouncing the w 's as v 's and v 's as f 's . 
  fun fact # 2 : i started teaching myself dutch recently !, 
  name in polish ? 
  szarlotka ( apple pie ) !, 
  which town is that may i ask ? 
  seen plenty polish shops ( inc mobile phone/diet supplement stores etc etc ) across ireland , but no restaurants ... 
  the name ` vodka ' is used as the generic term due largely to the polish ` w ' and ' \u00f3 ' confusing english speakers ( and i guess speakers of many other languages ) . 
  the russian name was easier and became the internationally used one . 
  i use the system of `` how many pints does an average hours work earn '' to compare living costs . 
  yep , and polish grammar is the hardest of the lot . 
  the vocab is none too simple either ... :(, 
  how do you mean ? 
  crime ? 
  lack of jobs for the dutch ? 
  racism ? 
  too many immigrants ? 
  or am i missing irony i should be catching due to the quotation marks around the `` immigrants '' ... 
  ** the cat is on fire . 
  ** in this example a specific known cat is being referred to ( or maybe being pointed at ) .
