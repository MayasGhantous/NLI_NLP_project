  possibly the cat which the other person in the conversation owns , but undoubtedly the only cat on fire in this scenario . 
  if more than one cat were to be on fire the speaker would be saying ` the cats ( pl ) are on fire ' . 
  if the speaker was meaning one of several cats in the room they may also say ` one of the cats ' , but this would also refer to specific cats - one of the cats present/owned by the person being informed . 
  ** a cat is in the garden . 
  ** who 's cat ? 
  not your friends cat from the previous example ( he is at the vets ) . 
  * a * cat . 
  * a * unknown cat . 
  it might be * a * stray cat with no owner nor home . 
  it might belong to * a * neighbour in the street . 
  it might be * a * cat owned by * the * crazy cat-woman who lives in * the * flat above . 
  from trying to learn polish i can understand this as for polish : easy - pronounciation hard - everything else . 
  especially the grammar . 
  i do n't like the '' ... or indirect profit '' bit . 
  with something vague like that which lawyer the defendant or the prosecution has may make a huge difference . 
  for a nation suffering mass unemployment and with an economy in deep recession to pass a law which could fill expensive prison spaces with regular jos\u00e9 's instead of hardened criminals is idiotic . 
  i was watching a section of some program in springtime on ( i think ) the bbc . 
  there are still less than 1000 speakers ( the number 600 springs to mind , though i can make no guarantees as to the accuracy of that number ) , but numbers are increasing and there is a school which is teaching it to kids . 
  they interviewed speakers of the language and showed footage . 
  i do n't know how many of the speakers would see it as their first language , but if it can regain numbers and become a commonly used second language in the area that would be a phenomenal achievement . 
  correction : cornish is on life support , but slowly getting stronger having nearly died . 
  i hitchhike a lot , and thus have drivers from all over the continent . 
  on one occasion i had one moldovan driver who ended up speaking to me in a mixture of spanish , portuguese , russian and french while i spoke back in a mixture of french , polish and spanish . 
  his french was far too weak for him to converse in and likewise my spanish too weak for me to converse in . 
  these were however the languages we understood best of the other persons . 
  we used our other languages when a word was not understood , so we ended up with a crazy mixture of our 2nd + languages but a conversation that somehow , feck knows how , worked out . 
  the joys of language families are that sometimes you can recognise/understand some thanks to a knowledge of a related language . 
  tourists do not miss krak\u00f3w . 
  you ca n't move for them in the summer !, 
  i have to go there next time i 'm back . 
  never heard of it before , and i 've spend about 1.5 of the last 4 years in poland !, 
  ireland : the more we take the piss out of you , the more you can be sure we like you . 
  i like this bluntness . 
  it was posted a day ago on / r/mapporn , you 've just used a different variant of the same jpeg 's file address gained from the ` get embed codes ' bit ... 
  it was also posted one day ago [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1mficn/sex_ratio_in_the_european_union_2249_x_2490/ ), 
  repost after only one day ? 
  seriously ? 
  [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1mficn/sex_ratio_in_the_european_union_2249_x_2490/ ) . 
  using the link from the ` get embed codes ' does not mean it 's a different image !, 
  an idea mostly voted for by english mp 's , the negative effects will be felt by those in rural areas and islands . 
  this means it mostly affects scotland . 
  scots already have to pay more , often a lot more , to receive parcels .

  i have n't bothered putting up anything by bands that others have posted .

  bring beamish . 
  spoiler : it is a bowl of death . 
  looks like death , smell like death ... and tastes worse . 
  we 're forced to learn their language , they should learn ours rather than be confused about the names of things !, 
  sod that , i 'm joining you guys , especially if you have kofola . 
  there is a chance they were caught on camera by the dashcam of a car being driven by a bear ... 
  if you do n't like phones and receiving calls this could be an advantage for you , albeit one which pisses off your friends/family ... 
  thank you . 
  it 's a great game . 
  would like to make my own board some day . 
  before i visited : * what the flag looked like . 
  * geographical location on baltic sea between estonia and lithuania . 
  * capital is riga , football team there called skonta riga . 
  after visiting : * mad language !, 
  ) = please , alus = beer , paldies = thank you , prieka ( sp ? ), 
  = cheers . 
  * riga is stunning , but very flat - as is all the country . 
  highest point is only about 310-320m above sea level . 
  * huge markets in former zeppelin hangers in the city centre . 
  * currency is the lat , changing to the euro soon . 
  * good at ice hockey , a very popular sport in the country . 
  national team plays in maroon . 
  * lots of tall pretty blondes , but beware of those running scams in riga old town . 
  ( no , i did n't get caught on this one ! ) . 
  * ticket control on trams means the entire tram stopping between stops with nobody allowed on or off . 
  * cool huge statue for the liberation of riga ( or maybe latvia ? ), 
  a distance away from riga centre is really impressive but hated by latvians as it is seen as being pro-russia . 
  thus it has been blown up several times as a fuck you to the russians . 
  * on that note , latvia and latvians are not fans of russia ( and russians ? ), 
  - despite a huge number of russian speakers being there and russians living there . 
  * black balsams , an alcoholic spirit , is not very nice . 
  but their beer is good and cheap . 
  * there is a bar in riga dedicated to leika , the first dog in space . 
  * blackheads tower in riga has great views . 
  * jelgava has little to see , except a palace . 
  * the roads are ( or were ) terrible . 
  * they have a really cool pub game which i forget the name of . 
  a square board is used , with holes in the corners . 
  flat round disks of two colours and mini pool-like cues are used . 
  object of the game is to pot the disks before your opponent does . 
  exporting to latvia ? 
  [ it 's evolution , baby !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adaogu2cqti ), 
  that 's a shame . 
  i 'm a big fan of strengthening and saving minority languages . 
  the more languages we save the better , as it is nigh on impossible to revive them once dead . 
  it seems he is better known in greece than he is in most countries . 
  no idea why ( maybe you could shed some light on this ? ) . 
  there 's a greek rory gallagher fan club and everything !, 
  to be fair , we 're not too cold either . 
  no extremes of temperatures like northern europe gets .
