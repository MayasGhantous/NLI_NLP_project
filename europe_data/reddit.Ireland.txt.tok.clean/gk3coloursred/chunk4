  and amazing views from gellert hill including probably the best cityscape in the continent , especially by night . 
  it is , afaik , illegal to sell the previous days bread in france . 
  i am not aware if this law applies to croissants too or not . 
  ireland did n't even want to win , it just happened that even when they were trying to loose they will still better than the britain and others . 
  maybe it was to give a good impression , but it was still a good thing to do and for his country to be judged upon . 
  [ yes , depending on the situation/enemy ] ( https://usatlife.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/braveheart.jpg?w=768 ), 
  you and me both , though it was kosice i lived in . 
  the [ steel arena ice hockey stadium ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?q=steel+arena+kosice&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1034&amp;bih=619&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=d4rkvf_mncap7aam_ohiaw&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq&amp;dpr=1 ) is beautiful and highly attended , the [ lokomot\u00edva football stadium ] ( https://www.google.ie/search?q=lokomot%c3%adva+stadium+kosice&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1034&amp;bih=619&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=_yvkvy-jfoee7gasoid4bg&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq ) however whilst slightly bigger is neither as nearly as pretty , modern nor as busy on matchday ... 
  i 'd say it is relevant , bearing in mind fifa 's desire to see the world cup spread the popularity of the sport to new countries . 
  their first big step was to have the s. african world cup , which despite far more serious security concerns for fans went very well . 
  previous wc hosts : england never hosted a wc : russia previous euro hosts : england never hosted a euro 's : russia football match riots the night before the fifa vote : england no football match riots the night before the fifa vote : russia football stagnating : england football booming : russia also , i would guess your profits criterea as being wrong . 
  you think fifa would choose the least profitable country over the most profitable one , even with bribery ? 
  remember , it 's much cheaper to do anything in russia due to the cost of living/wages , but ticket/sponsorship prices for fans/companies will be the same as in england . 
  nope , [ this is her way of getting the message across ] ( http://imgur.com/r/ireland/bhaklwy ), 
  i dunno , but daniel o'donnell will have helped to sway many a granny to the yes campaign . 
  it 's ok , repay that by not voting for ireland . 
  besides , by ireland trying to loose every year it makes the competition more open to all . 
  old people are often looking for social interaction . 
  something like this is an excuse to get out which necessitates meeting/speaking with a couple of people and opens up the opportunity of randomly meeting other people , be they friends , neighbours or whatever . 
  whist the good relationship with the us is handy n ' all there 'd be a hell of a lot of people who 'd identify themselves as irish-americans in the us forces . 
  so much so that their inclusion with numbers would triple ( quadruple ? 
  more ? ), 
  the numbers of ` irish ' soldiers/sailor/pilots etc were the need arise . 
  if the time comes , the numbers with military training who 'd fight for ireland might not be small as our population and our own military force would indicate . 
  the number of irish-americans in the us forces would dwarf those of irish in irish forces . 
   what happens if the british go all cromwell on you again ? 
  maggie ^ the ^ cunt thatcher actually suggested using a ` cromwellian solution @ to the problems in the north in the mid-80 's . 
  why am i not shocked by ireland 's non-inclusion in her nations of biggest fans ... 
  sure , why not just let everyone without the correct travel documents into europe ? 
  i agree , but they need to be 10000 % sure that they have the right ( wo ) man for the crime ( s ) . 
  nothing would kill any support for it , no pun intended , like convicting the wrong person . 
  they can be as badass as they want , but the border guards will be fully armed with live ammunition and vast resources of backup who will also be backed up . 
  they shall not pass * . 
  * until they get the required documentation, 
  taxes go up , price stays the same , just one less in pack . 
  it 's more common for cigarette machines , but this may vary depending on country . 
  i mostly remember dunblane as i was in school in scotland at the time . 
  had germany had shootings then it would have had the same level of effect on me as ones in america due to my lack of connection to the country . 
  especially when we are young it can be hard to relate to overseas events . 
  nowadays this may not be the case , but places i 've visited or have friends from are of more note personally . 
  off the top of my head i can only remember dunblane ( scotland , ~ 1995 ) and toulouse ( a few months ago ) . 
  what 's a swag ? 
  tent ? 
  sleeping bag ? 
  and not all of europe is freeze-to-death cold and full of murderous gypsies , do n't believe the hype !, 
  slept many a time all over europe in just the sleeping bag , regardless of time of year or country !, 
  not died yet !, 
  where do you think your perth is named after ? 
  yes , but europeans make the news everywhere for good and bad reasons on a daily basis . 
  do we need to discuss every one of these things over topic titles that make them sound like they happened in this hemisphere/continent when they did n't ? 
  had you said ' ... island , off australia ' there 'd have been no need to drag you up on this . 
  i do n't read / r/europe to find out about the news of australia/usa/china / brazil , there is / r/worldnews or other continents/countries reddits for those . . 
  but perth is in the geographical centre of scotland , it has no islands !, 
  nor are there quokka in scotland , afaik . 
  do n't get me wrong , what they did was * despicable * , but if you 're going to talk about * another * perth , not the scottish/european one but another one from the opposite side of the world in another continent when you 're posting in / r/europe you ought to mention that ... 
  ( apologies for my sketchy polish , i never study ), 
  booooo !, 
  it 's ok , you can write w\u00f3dka here !, 
  what the hell is wrong with people ? 
  easyjet sandwiches are n't even all that good . 
  the scots invented a ridiculous number of things for such a small nation . 
  aka 10 hours after the pub opens . 
  i can almost guarantee that you 'll find lipton yellow label in your local polish shop . 
  not that you should buy it , it is indeed crap . 
  barry 's tea is of course the best tea known to mankind . 
  a huge amount of land in spain is semi-desert . 
  also , * percentage * ( of population ) , not ` number of ... ' . 
  nor is it really ` great ' . 
  ` alright britain ' however is n't so catchy . 
  ( yes , i know the reasoning for it being called great is due to size , not it 's supposed awesomeness ), 
  in irish ` italy ' is ` an iod\u00e1il ', 
  i do n't identify myself as being european . 
  europe is a fine continent , do n't get me wrong , but whilst accurate i 'd be as likely to describe myself as an earthling as i would describe myself as european . 
  you obviously have n't been in his mom 's hoohah yet . 
  it 's kinda fun being in there , though i 'm not sure any of us say we take pride in being in there . 
  you spelt ` bertie the c ** t ahern ' wrong . 
  1 ) french was the official language of england for about 300 years , from 1066 till 1362 . 
  2 ) many english people do not like fact # 1 . 
  hrvatska = hr , not only in country code but also in web domain is fairly well known . 
  selecting greece would have made your point better . 
  greece aka hellenic republic = el ( ? ), 
  but with a web domain of . gr ... 
  you realise for that skiing you mention you 'll probably have to experience a little cold at the same time , yeah ? 
  it 's awesome . 
  it 's one of the many reasons why i chose poland in the other emigration topic . 
  [ irish here ] * nobody * said poland ? 
  i 'd be one of my top choices . 
  great climate with hot summers and cold winters , lively cities , all the geographic features you could want ( be they mountains , lakes , coastline , meadows/farmland ) good food and drink , stunning women and more . 
  ok , the language is tricky , and to make a good living a bit harder - but nowhere is perfect . 
  other options ? 
  slovakia ( stunning scenery and countryside , i 'd live rurally here ) , netherlands ( it 's just ... 
  nice !, 
  ) , belgium ( like nl , but slightly less appealing for no particular reason ) and norway/sweden/denmark ( not been , but they seem like they 'd be good places to live due to high quality of life ) . 
  the women ? 
  you do realise they 're batshit mental , yeah ? 
  source : italian girlfriend , italian flatmate , italian friends ... 
  ah , never heard that . 
  thank you . 
  10 years `` if weed is legal in italy / u/brainlaag will smoke elephant cock '', 
  portugal will dispute this , evora time .
