  you do realise there many snakes in ireland now though ? 
  pets mostly , but some have escaped ... to gain vengeance on the ancestors of he who banished them . 
  not in ireland , that i know of . 
  there is a prepaid version of the internet i was overcharged by , but the cap is tiny . 
  that will never happen . 
  you can get reasonable speeds and prices in fiber areas . 
  outside of that ... buy some lube . 
  also , is it not also true that isps are not capable of accurately measuring data used ? 
  i ca n't find a source but it was discussed on reddit quite a bit last year . 
  i am currently temporarily living away from the city . 
  the 3g internet i use is very reliable . 
  i just use it for work . 
  try to avoid youtube , etc. 
  for the most part . 
  it 's not possible to get fiber here and dsl is extremely expensive . 
  very bad speeds , ridiculous caps and you need to pay a load of bullshit monthly charges for the privilege of being able to pay them for internet on its own . 
  got a monthly bill of nearly $ 200 yesterday . 
  i was the equivalent of a couple of percent over the cap . 
  i was charged $ 175 on top of the monthly rate . 
  cancelling it on monday . 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  coming to ireland in the year twenty-never . 
  now send us some of your women , please . 
  is great day for latvia , is coming end of suffering for everybody . 
  no feel cold and hunger any more . 
  see up near the top right where it says  submit a new link  submit a new text post  ** europe ** below that you 'll see  show my flair on this subreddit . 
  it looks like :  webus97 ( edit ) click on edit and then click whichever flag takes your fancy , then click save . 
  does n't understand the reporter , but angry enough about it to tell him to go fuck himself . 
  hmm . 
  it would be interesting to see a separate chart with energy prices without tax applied . 
  there are some big differences in rates between countries . 
  [ satire ] ( http://youtu.be/old8nv7c8qs ) but sort of relevant to the situation . 
  this not happen , is first run out of alcohol . 
  this joke would work a lot better if i did n't have an irish tricolour beside my username . 
  turning off street lamps at night to save energy ? 
  lol, 
  orange juice . 
  my nose . 
  out of there . 
  i get them mixed up too often as well . 
   * large * curry cheese chips are the greatest thing country-folk have contributed to our fair isle . 
  ftfy, 
  there a little place near me run by an english guy that serves all day breakfast . 
  ironically it does n't open until midday anyway . 
  i used to go in there regularly with a friend that has since emigrated . 
  you would have to plan ahead if you wanted to go there . 
  not too much for dinner the day before and no breakfast the day of the feast . 
  something like $ 7.50 each and as much tea as you can drink . 
  oh yeah , forgot that . 
  if i was making a full irish i 'd have - two rashers - two sausage - a poached egg - one each of a large black and white pudding - a few slices of fried potato or potato farl - spoon of beans fried on the pan with a knob of butter - and i nearly forgot ... toast . 
  followed by keeling over and dying before the afternoon .

  i thought that was an irish flag , i was wondering where there f in ireland you lived where that was normal . 
  i know people that do that . 
  monsters . 
  [ curry coleslaw chips \\ ( fries \\ ) ] ( http://recipes.onlinefoodgrocery.com/images/recipes/curry%20coleslaw13010486741.jpg ) [ curry cheese chips ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mgrivn408fu/tu2iba0pysi/aaaaaaaaadq/naed3mijm0q/s1600/p1020048.jpg ) coleslaw cheese chips [ curry cheese coleslaw chips ] ( http://53degrees.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/no0001.jpg?w=300 ) [ battered sausages . 
  ] ( http://munchies2u.co.uk/shop/images/batteredsausage.jpg ) and apparently [ curry chips with peas ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mgrivn408fu/tu2h01t2i0i/aaaaaaaaadm/lxzvs7uoxks/s1600/p1020036.jpg ) is a thing , but i 've never seen it before . 
  and as other people have probably said , potatoes , which some of us sometimes call them `` spuds '' are [ everywhere ] ( http://i.imgur.com/shfpy.jpg ) . 
  for many irish , the potato is n't a vegetable at all . 
  home cooked meals would often be described as meat , potatoes and vegetables . 
  say i 'm at home on the weekend , i could have potato cakes ( usually leftover potatoes mixed with flour cooked until golden on a lightly oiled pan ) or just sliced leftover potatoes and a fried egg or something . 
  potatoes with dinner . 
  they could be just boiled , steamed or mashed with butter or par-boiled and then roasted along with other vegetables . 
  i get little potato cakes in the supermarket that you can toast , so that could be in there somewhere as an evening snack too . 
  so yeah , [ i was n't joking . 
  what do you consider a full english btw ? 
  eggs , bacon , pudding , tomato , mushroom or hash browns maybe ? 
  reddit is known for going off on tangents , but this is up there . 
  not an irish thing but i 'd much sooner have mayo with fries than ketchup . 
  i think we can . 
  i do n't make them but i consume a ridiculous amount of the ones i buy in the supermarket . 
  two rounds in the toaster , butter and a tiny bit of salt in middle and cup of tea . 
  yum . 
   as far as i can tell in the opinion of the average american our military can do no wrong . 
  i made , what i reckon was a smart and educated american lady , very **** ing angry when i questioned among other things , civil liberties and the the military in the us . 
  i gave her a take it or leave it opinion of mine that a signnificant % of americans are blind to a lot of what 's happening , in terms of why their sons and daughters are sent to fight wars halfway across the world , with very sketchy justification to say the least and that the idea they are doing it for the freedom of the american people is absolutely ludicrous . 
  she was sitting beside her friend who had that fog lifted when multiple close and extended family were bent over and ridden rock solid by the us military after laying down their lives . 
  i 'm a bit distracted here , the above may not have been that coherent , but a normally level headed woman went in batshit crazy ` merica mode when i hinted at the subject in a way she did n't like . 
  i guess people do n't like their world-view and where they see themselves and the us in the world threatened . 
   who are you going to hate if not your neighbors ? 
  ourselves . 
  we 're extremely good at that . 
  when dinny says jump , enda says `` how high ? '', 
  yes and no . 
  it depends . 
  that 's actually a good point . 
  that is what happened in ireland once all the motorways were built . 
   if you own a tv/radio you have to pay a fee . 
  this fee is collected by billag , one of the most disliked/hated companies in switzerland . 
  the fee is ** 462 chf annually ** . 
  we pay $ 160 in ireland and there is huge opposition to it . 
  the national broadcaster in ireland , rt\u00c9 , receives tv licence money , but also fills the stations with adverts . 
  are they proposing it be changed or is there some in-joke about it ? 
  without going on a big rant , the administrators of football in ireland look after their own interests first and football comes a distant second . 
  football was set back 10-15 years in my city because it was politically convenient for the chairman of the league to block one club from playing in the league in favour of inviting two others who he could count on for votes . 
  that horror show he created has been somewhat corrected , but the club that remains is probably the only one in the world that is prevented from having any youth system at all and the uefa solidarity money that is paid to clubs , as long as you meet requirements , such as x number of youth teams , goes to his the his buddy 's clubs instead . 
  the money involved in football in ireland is absolutely minute compared to what goes through fifa , but they way they act here is just as corrupt . 
   so how many of those 2,500 die in brand new cars ? 
  i imagine it 's a tiny percentage , as they 're generally the safer cars to crash in anyway .
