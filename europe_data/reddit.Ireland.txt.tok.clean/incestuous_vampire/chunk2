  i think a some of the damage should be left there thats what they did in dublin reminds you what bullets can do and the damage is it 's own kind of memorial . 
  `` in the rare old times '' i think it says a lot about how cities changed in the 20 ^ th century .

  the ulster bank building is fairly [ cool ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/the_ulster_bank_group_hq,_george's_quay_plaza_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1743476.jpg ) and the [ customs house ] ( http://www.shanemcdonald.org/smdpics/irl_dublin_customs-house.jpg ) right acros the river . 
  a lot of people are ok with merkel for us there could have been a much worse german leader picked in the last german elections . 
  you put the decimal place too far to the left there france . 
  if you click view image and then c/p you get a much shorter link . 
  but we like annoying russia . 
  the average wage in the us is the highest in the wourld . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_average_wage the strength of international courts depends on national governments .

  it feels weird saying the in the name of a country . 
   less rainy than ireland not saying a lot there . 
  what 's vladivostok like ? 
  it seems a lot like the irish famine , there is a massive food problem and the people at the top decide to really fuck over some smaller less important zone for there own benefit as well as those in the home land .

  it 's going to be great not being mentioned with greece . 
  that 's fucked up our government only did this . 
  i agree that 's basically how i think the law should be , but i think drugs fall inside that code others do n't . 
  the point is if in the future there is some new civil rights thing the constitution or the law will have to be changed and that means the matter will have to be voted on either by the population or the politicians , we will hopefully will never be in the situation where these things are decidedby committee, 
  i do n't think that 's how it works . 
  then how do we decide what is a human right . 
  i thinks for how ever long the eu exists it will be unbelievably complicated , so many countries all doing there own laws from different legal traditions and every government has a different way of passing laws and their own constitution and every thing has to be translated at least once . 
  sweet fuck is that scary , reducing the number of muslim immigrants to europe is probably a good idea . 
  i had this moment of `` wtf is everyone worried about '' when i found out this lad i know is a muslim after he had given me his dealers number . 
  most immigrants in europe are from other european countries . 
  the roads in southern italy scare the shit out of me . 
  what 's with all the lemon trees in the middle of urban areas ? 
  we could put weapons up there that would help space development it is after all only a matter of time until some one uses a space weapon in anger any way .

  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; how would you know . 
  .9 millimetre is 90 % of a millimetre that 's like three pixels . 
  do n't be silly there are russians in the antarctic . 
  apparently in the run up they do lots of politics via email and such . 
  if i was in the nsa that 's what i would do . 
  latin america has a shit ton of catholics and it 's the us 's back garden . 
  is it not 9mm . 
  we do have both [ with regards to europe ] and that is not where the problems come from . 
  the biggest welfare cost is healthcare immigrants are mostly young they are not as big a drain on the system as the average native . 
  immigrants unemployment rate is 3.8 % higher than average it 's quite small it 's made out to be larger . 
  you do n't actually think that the woman in the video will be sent home her family are n't going to rat her out she will just move to a cousins or something and not turn up to the government office like you must have a cousin in new york you know the deal . 
  one harm is that the family will resent the government unless most of the rich countries want a decreasing population we do need immigrants most whom are un-skilled or low-skilled it 's hardly a soup kitchen they pay rent and food and other goods with tax but if they are illegal immigrants then they will get rent at least tax free . 
  well it might slow the integration process by forcing people who have difficulty learning the language to go off the grid ~ ~ or go back ~ ~ .

  it looks off it 's so flat with no wires over head . 
  read that as europe 's most populated cities . 
  ireland man : weakness to much land and the sun . 
  and tax ? 
  that 's true but the us government has trouble passing laws seems a bit to weak for my taste , also allowing the constitution to be changed by politicians is definitely to much for me . 
  in ireland the government is usually a large coalition that gradually loses it 's majority and then collapses so it 's not like our democracy has n't got safeguards against strong government and a general `` it 'll be grand '' attitude we have the blasphemy law never used and the old censorship laws same story . 
  ya but the netherlands has practise at holding the sea back . 
  i imagine as long as you can keep the sea at bay the companies that make the sea walls will go around saving dublin and miami and the other cites on the coast from the sea . 
  you 'll have the last laugh when sea levels rise . 
  there was fuck all coverage here , the german election was the same day as the biggest sporting event in ireland so what can you do . 
  but my reaction and the one person i talked to about it have bean positive merkel has bean ok to ireland with that promissory note deal and i 'm glad that some one who would be harder on the piigs did not get in . 
  times are hard , immigrants less liked in britain and r/worldnews is full of racism .
