  the brewers are based in carlow which is next door to wexford and they do a few ales ( their pale ale is fantastic ) . 
  ireland is kind of stuck for decent homegrown beers , but there 's a growing craft beer movement so that 's starting to change ( thankfully ) . 
  my personal favourite would be galway hooker . 
   the murdered has been arrested wow , it really is n't his day . 
   anything that 's sung in english ( unless you 're british ) . 
  http://robrien.orconhosting.net.nz/careful%20now.jpg in all seriousness , here 's some of my favourite irish acts . 
  [ lisa hannigan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvwjma5b1qg ) [ wallis bird ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1srw8kndhli ) [ gemma hayes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-glhc8ioeta ) [ god is an astronaut ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zedhsdoqxns ), 
  not necessarily . 
  in the long run it may be more of an adjustment to the process of more centralisation than a reverse of it . 
   i 'm thinking that 's exactly what each generation used to say about the ones before it , and what the coming generation will say about the young people of today . 
  this is it . 
  the eternal problem of every society is getting enough young people active and engaged in politics in order to make a positive change . 
  instead what we end up with is conveyor belt politics , where people essentially wait until it 's `` their turn '' to take over power . 
  all i got from this exchange was something about coffee , croissants and prussians in lederhose . 
  i have a very weird mental image right now ... 
  probably austria . 
  was in salzburg a few years ago and loved it . 
  my german 's pretty non existant though ( i know enough to ask for two pretzels and a beer please and thank , but that 's about it ) so i probably wo n't be moving there any time soon . 
  out of curiosity , would milk do anything to help neutralize the acid , or would it be too weak to do anything noticeable ? 
  i 'm honestly surprised people still pay attention to the imf . 
  we 're getting there , slowly , but we 're getting there . 
  the dublin bike scheme is being expanded all the time and there 's that new luas line going down as well . 
  plus the dart is getting a bunch of new lines as well as far as i know . 
  sounds like ireland . 
  we should set up some sort of moany exchange program ... then complain about it . 
  i would n't say he was fighting to free ireland from occupation . 
  there were significant numbers of vikings and hiberno-norse in his army at the battle of clontarf and by the time he was fighting a lot of the original viking raiders had settled in ireland and had largely become as irish as the irish . 
  he was fighting more to cement his authority on the island more than anything else . 
  he is one of our heroes though , i 'm kicking myself that i forgot about him . 
  [ michael collins ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_collins_%28irish_leader%29 ) - one of the main organisers of the ira 's guerilla war during the war of independence among other things . 
  [ gr\u00e1inne n\u00ed mh\u00e1ille ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grace_o%27malley ) the pirate queen of mayo . 
  3 of the counties of ulster are in ireland , so no , it is n't . 
  what about ghandi ? 
  3 of the counties of ulster are in ireland , so northern ireland technically is n't ulster . 
  besides , you have n't lived till you 've taken in the sites and sounds of supermacs on eyre square at 2 in the morning . 
  i 've heard stories of irma hitting up pubs for any * potential * music a pub might play , just in the off case that a song might be covered by copyright . 
  the irma ( the irish equivalent ) is doing much the same thing here and it 's fucking over what is already a struggling pub/club industry . 
  i know , but the majority of the large scale , dense development is on the coasts . 
  y' know like that area stretching down from new york to philedelphia . 
  i was n't saying there was n't any in the middle . 
  i 'm in denver right now and so far everyone has been lovely . 
  my only qualm is that if you go to the shop/supermarket you 're only choices are to buy one of something or 100 of something . 
  there does n't seem to be any happy in between . 
  its the classic urban/rural divide . 
  americas urban centers are on the coasts and thats where you get the largest concentration of `` left-wing '' support . 
  you see it on a smaller scale in texas . 
  austin is quite liberal while the surrounding hinterland is conservative . 
  stockholm , but i think thats because i have the syndrome . 
  il papa 's house . 
  protected by the swiss guard . 
  makes a mockery of catholic claims to humbleness and poverty . 
  lots of fancy architecture and artwork . 
  its a recession everywhere except the irish shop keepers mind . 
  * trolled the spanish during the 30 years war * toblerones * swiss army knives * speak french , german , italian ( ? ), 
  and rhaetian . 
  * ~ ~ cuckoo ~ ~ clocks and fondue * sitting in their mountain bunkers biding their time, 
  never knew that , cheers !, 
  the 45 was always my nemesis . 
  used to get it in from loughlinstown to iadt every morning . 
  eventually i found out it was faster to walk there than wait for the damn thing . 
  and naturally after waiting 30 - 40 minutes for one , three of them would show up . 
  do n't mind him , he 's the resident / r/ireland troll come out of his cave for the day . 
  it really was a sign of the times , when of all routes , the hallowed 46a got itself shunted all over the place . 
  if you 're into the dubliners you might like planxty . 
  the individual members are pretty good on their own too , particularly donal lunny and christie moore . 
  [ planxty - arthur mcbride ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8yqw7h6iqi ) [ matt molloy & donal lunny ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds7nxjdp4zq ) [ christy moore - delirium tremens ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl1nqi_vit0 ), 
  sure is n't belgium known for it 's chocolate and paedophiles . 
  and they only make the chocolate to get to the kids . 
  it 's still used as the presidents seal as well . 
  the way languages are taught here is terrible . 
  it 's a case of memorise how to conjugate lists of verbs so that you know them by rote . 
  there 's very little time given over to learning the languages in a practical ( conversational ) sense . 
  were n't the tories the party that was always complaining about the nanny state ? 
  yeah in retrospect i probably should have just said your average person . 
  either way though my point stands . 
  thanks to mass media your average american is convinced a bunch of semi literate peasants clambering about some monkey bars in the desert are more a threat to their freedoms than their own elected officials . 
  * used to be big , is now small ( that whole austro-hungarian thing ) . 
  * salzburg is gorgeous * ottoman advance into europe was halted at vienna on two occasions * schnapps , strudel , forests, 
  it 's largely seen as irrelevant ( in it 's current form at least ) and has no real power . 
  ireland - the government has confirmed it 's going to have a referendum on abolishing the seanad ( senate ) . 
  ~ ~ if the referendum is rejected it 'll be reformed instead . ~ ~ the re-appearance of the day moon and hot weather has caused great consternation and joy in equal measure among the good citizens . 
  other than that , an anti-abortion rally took place , a bridge was named after the last president and the national examinations ( junior and leaving certs ) started . 
  students taking the exams are pissed because the nice weather showed up just in time for the exams and will no doubt piss off just as they finish . 
  edit : bridge , not motorway . 
  i do n't think anyone expects it and it 's a simple smile and a thanks . 
  nobody really thinks much beyond it than that . 
  aeroflot got me a free night in cuba once . 
  the route went moscow , shannon , havana , mexico and then the reverse on the way back . 
  the day we were supposed to leave , we arrived at the airport only to be told that the pilot had forgotten to land and was now somewhere over the atlantic on his way to shannon . 
  we were put up in a 5 star hotel while they made arrangements to get everyone home . 
  does n't hurt to be pleasant . 
  in ireland they tend to be okay so long as you stick to groceries . 
  the meat products are usually poisonous or incredibly shit though . 
  two german teams playing in the heart of london . 
  i 'm surprised churchill has n't risen from the grave and led an army of the dead down on wembley lord of the rings style . 
  balanced and reasoned appraisals of things do n't sell newspapers though . 
  had n't you heard ? 
  the e.u. 
  is evil and any of it 's attempts to enact consumer care are actually just part of a grand fiendish plot to further corporate interests and steal your freedums . 
  i got angus beef sausages from aldi the other day .
