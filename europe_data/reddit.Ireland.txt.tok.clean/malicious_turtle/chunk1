... you do realise this has nothing to do with ireland being a `` tax haven '' , it 's about a specific deal that was specifically made with apple by the government years ago . 
  irish person here living outside dublin ... what 's public transport ? 
  the main forces probably not but the special forces the rangers are supposed to be top quality are n't they ? 
   do not talk to the bus driver when driving . 
  here in ireland i 've had bus drivers that would n't shut the fuck up no matter how much i tried to avoid the conversation . 
  another needless massacre . 
  the eu was supposed to ** prevent ** this happening . 
  where did it all go wrong ?? 
  there 's huge manufacturing facilities here . 
  intel has just invested ~ $ 5 billion upgrading it 's leixlip plant to produce the 14nm broadwell chips coming out sometime in the next 12 months . 
  it 's 1 of only 3 in the world making these new chips . 
  depends where the people you were talking to were from tbh . 
  if they grew up 4 miles from the middle of no-where ( like me ) then i can definitely imagine someone saying something mindbogglingly stupid . 
  if they were born and raised in a city like dublin or galway it 'd most likely be said as a joke , if at all . 
  that 's hardly the sole reason . 
  just taking intel as an example , they 've invested billions in it 's leixlip plant to produce it 's new 14nm chips , there 's only 3 plants in the world making the 14nm chips and leixlip is the only one outside of america . 
  if all that investment is purely for tax reasons i will be absolutely astonished . 
  so are you saying intel has spent ** b ** illions in ireland , just to save a few ... ** m ** illion ? ... intel is only one example but you get the idea . 
   despite denmark and norway being two different countries . 
  they 're really not helping the stereotype that americans know nothing about world geography . 
   it seems easier to empty the mediterranean : build a dam at gibraltar . 
  there actually was a natural dam there up until 5.33 million years ago . 
  [ zanclean flood ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zanclean_flood ), 
  `` the '' basically . 
  `` an \u00cdsiltir '' - '' ** the ** low country '' . 
  been a while since i done irish so i could be wrong . 
  just in-case you overlooked it this article is from 08 august last year . 
  since then we 've had the abortion scandal ( which is still continuing ) and the catholic church is completely against abortion while the majority of the population are for it . 
  so more people have probably turned away from religion since last august . 
  ( speaking from ireland ) there is a black market for guns , but only for fairly powerful gangs and terrorist organizations ... top drug gangs , ira etc. 
  i dont know much about those shooting in germany but i 'd imagine they were ordinary citizens ( albeit mentally unstable ) so availability of hand guns and such is probably out of reach of ordinary citizens . 
  i do n't really think that 's true . 
  from thue 's link , in 2002 the then president of the united states george w. bush said that iran was part of an axis of evil along with iraq and north korea . 
  since they decided to go to war with iraq i really do n't it 's that unbelievable to think they wanted to go to war with iran even back then . 
   an ayatollah who regularly calls us things like the great satan etc. 
  and called for israel to be wiped off of the map . 
  i really do n't get this . 
  like what 's the difference between the ayatollah saying those things and the israeli 's and republicans saying things like `` we should bomb iran '' or `` we should declare war on them '' . 
  is it not basically the same thing ? 
  and gas , the persian pipeline still has to be built . 
  why was abdullah ghavami chahzanjiru and salman ghanbari chahzanjiri executed ? 
  by all reports what they were doing was consensual [ and these 3 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/07/iran-executes-men-homosexuality-charges ) . 
  like the article says it does n't happen very often but it can still happen . 
   being gay is officially defined as `` sexual deviation '' in iran . 
  it is considered sinful in islam , taboo in the iranian society , ** and a crime in the eyes of iranian law . 
  ** a crime which can and has resulted in gay men being executed . 
  i never said most people executed are gay or a lot or a sizeable number , i said some which should imply a small number . 
  iran has the potential to be the least creepy , they still execute an enormous amount of people some of which are executed just for being gay . 
  reminds me of [ fester ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/addamsfamily/images/c/c6/festermovie.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20111109220851 ), 
  poland ? 
  imagine what 'd happen if irish soldiers were sent to die for an english colony . 
  it 'd be enough to resurrect the ira . 
  why is there so many americans flags here if they do n't feel welcome ? 
  it was about civil rights more so than independence . 
  post 1920s northern ireland was set up to treat catholics as second class citizens ; gerrymandering was widespread , catholics could n't join the police service etc. 
  that 's basically what brought about the troubles . 
  this place is literally solitary . 
  one article i read about the place said that one prisoner has all his mail screened and is only allowed 2 15 minute phone calls to his family each ** month ** . 
  a punch to the face in the general population would be welcome human contact after spending a few years in adx . 
  that 's exactly what i said condensed to the size of a nutshell , well done sir , your powers of deduction clearly know no bounds . 
  ( non sarcastic reply ) if a black person is completely excluded from society why would they want to contribute to it ? 
  black person gets thrown in jail for something a white person would never be jailed for , black person loses all ability to get employed , black person even loses right to vote ... is it any wonder there are riots . 
  basically the ira started out with a righteous cause and then gradually it became a not so righteous cause . 
  according to some reports he is an irish citizen , he 's lived here for a decade . 
   p.s. 
  america is also dealing with a gang problem most europeans would not believe . 
  a gang problem ? 
  are you serious ? 
  europe has neo-nazi problems americans would n't believe , europe has terrorist problems americans would n't believe . 
  ireland for example had a problem with the pira yano the people that blew innocent people to bits all over ireland/northern ireland/england for decades and we managed to build a prison for them in portlaoise that did n't involve confining them to their windowless rooms for 23 hours a day . 
  how does being a terrorist justification for solitary confinement and a near complete ban on outside communication ? 
  i varies alot in the country , a pint of smithwicks in my local pub ( middle of the bog ) is $ 3.70 and a pint in temple bar is $ 5 . 
  lager is $ 4 i think in my local pub but it could be upwards of $ 6/7 if you go into the wrong place in temple bar . 
  if the dissident republicans would just fuck off that 'd be great . 
  you honestly think irish soldiers should be sent half way across the world to defend an english colony ? 
  why are you linking those to me ? 
  i told you i know about the racism . 
  ... i know , most of my aunties and uncles moved to america and england between the 1920s and 50s , what 's your point ? 
  if they 're highly educated i do n't think anyone except neo nazis would have a problem with them . 
  the difference is that a poor person from , say , ireland is vastly more educated and open minded than a poor person from somalia . 
  it does n't take much for an irish person to adjust to life in america , england , australia etc. 
  someone coming from a war torn country wo n't be able to do it that easily . 
   a european army would see the falklands as its territory what would you say to irish soldiers ? 
  would they really be forced to defend an english colony ? 
  if only the racists and neo nazis had n't taken / r/european ... oh well ... maybe / r/europeanfootball, 
  sure why not . 
  first though i think we should start our own european subreddit where we can talk about european matters and name it / r/europe or something ... 
  it 's in every thread about fifa investigations up to and including today , it was funny the first , second and maybe seventh time but now it just belongs in / r/shitamericanssay, 
  well for starters switzerland is the one investigating qatar and russia 's bid for the world cup , they also arrested 7 senior officials and they raided the fifa headquarters in zurich and seized loads of data . 
  saying the usa saved football when it 's not true and saying it in / r/europe of all places is just the height of arrogance and definition of cringe . 
  your comment belongs here --  / r/worldnews or / r/circlejerk, 
  the exact figure is $ 12.5 billion , ~ $ 9 billion . 
  the latest upgrades for their 14nm chips cost ~ $ 5 billion dollars . 
  intel has invested over $ 10 billion ( yes billion ) just in leixlip in it 's time here in ireland . 
  it also has a smaller plant in shannon . 
  i 'm in the republic so i have no idea . 
  sinn fein are the voice of reason in stormont ( in comparison to the dup anyway ) . 
  they introduced a bill to leagalise same sex marriage a few months ago but the dup shut it down . 
  ok your a troll , whatever . 
  it * may * have been possible to pass this through the d\u00e1il ( parliament ) , [ this wiki page has more info than me ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thirty-fourth_amendment_of_the_constitution_%28marriage_equality%29_bill_2015 ) aside from the technicalities , this is a preferable way to me because now same sex marriage is enshrined in the constitution so it ca n't be changed without a referendum .
