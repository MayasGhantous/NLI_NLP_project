  belfast has a murder rate of 2.6 / 100,000 , if it was an american city it would be the 5th safest , tied with lincoln , nebraska . 
  i ( cross ) posted some interesting photos what 's the big deal ? 
  they hav n't actually executed a gay person in a very long time . 
  yep ... one of many no so good incidents in northern ireland . 
  funnily enough arthur wellesley is irish . 
  thousands of extremely drunk people descend onto the streets and into takeaways , which is why there 's so many fights and other non sense , it 's the same in ireland . 
  i wonder how many people actually get this, 
  do n't know about localization but you could find a software job in a few days in dublin and in a week or 2 outside of dublin . 
  no innocent people are ever convicted in europe ? 
   us death row study : ** 4 % of defendants sentenced to die are innocent ** http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/28/death-penalty-study-4-percent-defendants-innocent would you still support the death penalty if you or someone you know were wrongfully convicted ? 
  glossing over the nf ? 
  the more ridiculous statement is this  ukip won just one seat in the u.k. general election in may the reason they only got 1 seat is because of the first past the post style of voting . 
  they received ** 3.9 million ** votes , about 13 % of the total . 
  that is not insignificant . 
  it 's not in order in comparison to other countries in the top 10 though . 
  italy , france , germany and the uk is higher and they have populations anywhere from a third to a half of russia and no where near the natural resources either . 
  you really ca n't comment on / r/europe if you 're from the uk and against a federal europe without being dog piled can you . 
  ignoring the snideness in your comment and the stupidity of it a lot of what was said by so called `` armchair educational experts '' is also said by actual experts . 
   make school much more active they literally mean more active as in more exercise , p.e whatever . 
   have no more homework no one says that , less homework is whats warranted . 
  going to school for 7ish hours and then having to spend 2 or 3 hours on homework in the evening is absolutely ridiculous . 
   no or less exams that 's already happening in countries where they 're putting a greater emphasis on continual assessment , like it is in college . 
   and of course not teach anything that is n't a science because what a pretentious waste of time that is . 
  not even going bother with this . 
   it 's a developing human . 
  their exact words which is correct . 
   also think its rights over the mother 's body trump hers ? 
  they never said that , which was my original point . 
  unless your talking about rape in particular your comment is by far the most ridiculous i 've read today . 
  what does your comment have to do with his ? 
  he never said any different . 
  i 'd actually rate that more ridiculous than the people who say life begins at conception . 
  because gay marriage was extremely easy to argue * for * and extremely hard to argue * against * . 
  in an abortion referendum i 'd vote yes to repeal it , but i can think of dozens of reasons why , even a person of sound mind , would vote no . 
  the referendum is going to depend entirely on how well the government convince the electorate that abortion will only be permitted in cases of rape , incest etc. 
  no point in putting it to a referendum unless it 's almost guaranteed to pass . 
  if it got defeated it be years and years before we could have another one . 
  for once i 'm happy to be from the country side , only a pint of lager is more than $ 4 around where i am . 
  is isis getting smarter or more desperate ? 
  i ca n't tell . 
   i mean would it really be an efficient use of resources for isis to send fighters across the mediterranean sea in a floating coffin of a boat it also would n't be very smart to send fighters over , they 're trying to be a full fledged state and they 're losing on almost every front , they need every man they have in the state to stay and fight in the state and not to go gallivanting off to europe . 
  they either are allowed or soon will be allowed ... i think ... 
  what about hungary ? 
  0.1 % of the population is muslim and they estimated 7.0 % , they were out by a factor of 70 , how could they get it so wrong ? 
  islam is the fast growing religion in ireland afaik , but it 's still < 1 % . 
  so it 's not a very useful statistic . 
  it had to be passed be referendum because the constitution did n't allow for it . 
  the referendum happened last may and passed by a huge margin . 
   albeit in the more peaceful areas in the east west ? 
  isis controls the east . 
  you can get any result you want by wording the questions of survey differently , that 's why i never take any notice of these . 
  assad is only as strong as iran and russia though . 
  the only reason the aleppo fronts like the airport are going so well is because of the several thousand members of the iranian backed militias . 
  anywhere where the syrian army is on it 's own they do n't fare too well . 
  the leader of isis al baghdadi wo n't even stay in one city/town for long because of the fear of airstrikes , not even in ar raqqa the so called capitol of isis . 
   let us just wait until the is and co have taken over even more countries . 
  isis and al nusra are losing on almost every front in syria and iraq . 
  most of isis territory is empty desert ( that 's not an exaggeration ) their only main population center in syria is raqqah . 
  for the rebels the only major city they hold is idlib and their portion of aleppo looks more and more in danger literally by the day . 
  the syrian army with huge help from iranian backed militias and russian air support have annihilating the rebels in southern aleppo . 
  topple assad just like hussein was toppled ? 
  how did that turn out ? 
  to topple assad they 'd have to declare war on russia and iran as well . 
  the debates themselves are n't annoying for me , it 's the attitude around them . 
  for each side it 's either absolute victory or complete surrender , there 's no grey areas , you have to be on one side or the other . 
   the fact that they have always been british and want to remains so ? 
  what a ridiculous statement . 
  if they were always british why do so many have irish passports now . 
  ... and it took 2 referendums the second only barley passed as well . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.stratfor.com/sites/default/files/main/images/syria_monograph_pop_density_v2.jpg ) population density map , the reality is they control very little . 
  or the line that connected sligo to cork who 's construction was funded by the english but closed by the irish . 
   they did not force oems to use android they force google apps on them if they want android to be anyway usable . 
  lol, 
  what would the situation be with an eu army ? 
   expeditionary force - ef - optional branch countries can chose to opt into responsible for power projection on the world stage . 
  entire army composed around navy e.g. 
  us navy never going to happen . 
  if this is even a remote possibility then the eu army is dead on arrival . 
  the vast majority of people and countries will be against it * because * it 'll be like the us navy . 
  do n't forget libya . 
  if it 's defensive then i 'm for it , but if it 's for invading countries like libya , completely leveling the place and then leaving it to islamists then no chance . 
  this ones better i think https://imgur.com/nau216l, 
   fiscal union it 'll never happen . 
  where we are now germany has all the benefits of a fiscal union without any of the drawbacks . 
  in the us the likes of california and new york have to subsidise other states every single year . 
  good luck selling that to the german people . 
  to make matters worse they 're one of , if not , the most resource rich countries in the world . 
  i 'm guna guess he 's american where full grown adults ca n't even buy alcohol . 
  a lot have moved to syria . 
   sohr : 2746 is fighters , 2814 rebel and islamist fighters and 3804 civilians have been killed by the ruaf since its campaign began in september 2015 http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=51553 the sohr is very biased the rebels as well btw . 
  russia is going building 3 supercarriers fyi . 
  carl cox and john digweed are the oldest of the lot ... 
  he is n't even that underground . 
  like he 's the headline of any festival he plays at , was resident of space ibiza for over 20 years and has played in nightclubs all over the world . 
  i really do n't get what your point is tbh, 
  you should go to the doctor and have a check for amnesia if you do n't remember , ever hear of the piigs ? 
  one of the i 's being ireland in the off chance you do n't remember and most did say we deserved what we got . 
  i think it 's more of a lack of sympathy ( at least for me ) , you reap what you sow etc, 
  why are n't altered headlines banned ? 
  would you complain about the `` far left '' if they were trying to get a statue of general franco torn down ?
