`` want '' or `` are addicted to '' ? 
   for a mass-produced lager , i 'd take grolsch . 
  grolsch is a pilsener . 
  edit : okay , my bad . 
  pilsener is a type of lager . 
  i think you 've got the wrong end of the stick , i have n't been talking about france or burkhas . 
  ` british norms ' was the thing . 
   no private property owners can set rules for how people are dressed when they enter their private property . 
  did you mean : `` no , private property owners can set rules for how people are dressed when they enter their private property . 
  people on private property are somehow not british ? 
  i do n't follow your logic . 
  whether the first one set a precedent does n't negate it as an example . 
  the point that was made was that `` banning clothes would be something that runs contrary to british norms . '' . 
  whether or not any of the links i posted are `` are countrywide legislation restricting the use of a piece of clothing for everyone '' , ever happened ( or came to fruition i think you meant ) , or are `` really that controversial '' , the point stands that banning clothing does not necessarily * run contrary to british norms * . 
  even schoolchildren in britain wear strictly mandated uniforms and the vast majority of clothing is vetoed . 
  edit : clarified : `` or came to fruition i think you meant '', 
  it does n't ? 
  i think it does . 
   banning clothes would be something that runs contrary to british norms . 
  not really . 
  happens all the time .

  try driving through northern ireland with a dutch phone , the `` welkom in engeland '' sms from my provider is utterly wrong . 
  the irish president , michael d. higgins did the same for his own salary upon taking office . 
  [ after assuming office , the president wrote to the department of public expenditure and reform to request that his salary be reduced by 23.5 percent from $ 325,000 to about $ 250,000 . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_d._higgins#presidency ), 
   i would attribute that to our boom and high minimum wage and possibly our lax social welfare system . 
  i think it 's more simply explained by all of the language jobs available . 
  i very much doubt if 80 % of the foreigners in ireland came from other eu states for the social welfare , our cost of living is very high too in comparison to the rest of europe . 
  enjoy !, 
  the [ mobile roaming fees ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1hcunu/european_roaming_costs_to_decrease_again/ ) are coming down too !, 
   this article has been taken down pending an investigation . 
  seems you 're right and i counted wrong . 
  just to summarise : rmc , for . 
  ecumenicalmatter , no stated preference . 
  vassilizaitsev , against . 
  pterrorist , against lightbul , against brim4brim , for ferdbags , against still , i think it 's not a representative sample . 
  there 's more posts for its abolition there than against ... ? 
  citation needed , my observation is that most are for . 
  that 's not true , it provides sinecures for ageing politicians and their cronies . 
   if the referendum is rejected it 'll be reformed instead . 
  just to point out that this is completely untrue . 
  people who are anti-abolition are repeating this because they think it will rally more people to their cause . 
   obviously it would with me , i 'm irish . 
  how do you expect me to know your nationality ? 
   it 's unlikely that everyone on here knows that . ie means ireland . 
  now you 're just being silly . 
  it 's obvious from the website . 
  the journal . 
  ** ie ** saying `` president '' would n't twig with you that it eant the irish president ? 
  seriously ? 
  what 's her stance on national politics ? 
  just out of curiosity ... 
  we deserve it for dustin ... 
  the only negative that i recall was a lot of grocery shops and newsagents rounding up prices and abusing the confusion around the conversion rates . 
  that was only temporary though and i 'd hate to go back . 
  wonderful idea ratchet , look forward to more !, 
  oh i know , it was n't meant to be any kind of slur , she was just explaining why getting an abortion was an issue . 
  accurately too if you ask me . 
  [ no she said it alright ] ( http://www.rte.ie/news/health/2013/0410/380613-savita-halappanavar-inquest/ ) . 
  she just did n't mean it in the way it has been popularly inferred . 
   i did n't rip off his text . 
  so just the post then . 
   i did n't rehost it or anything , i 'm just sharing it around . 
  did n't know i had to be the original poster of an image to be allowed to post the same image to other subreddits without being called a douche . 
  you do n't have to be the original poster , you just have to at least give credit within reason . 
  come on , he just created it today ffs . 
  if you 're not going to give him a chance to post it around himself the least you could do is credit the source . 
   i did n't say or imply that i created it . 
  what prevented you from crediting him or even saying it was a cross post ? 
  seems to me your long description of the map [ based on riomhare 's comments ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/16gshj/meaning_of_irish_county_names_oc1000x1250xpost/c7vvc9v ) did indeed imply that you created it . 
  just commenting to say it 's incredibly douchy of you to not credit [ riomhaire ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/riomhaire ) for creating this . 
  it has n't even been 20 hours and you 're even ripping off his text in your comments . 
  [ original post . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/16g9uw/meanings_of_county_names/ ), 
  but ... he did n't say islam ... what am i missing here ? 
  is he a known anti-islam poster or something ? 
   and please do n't tell us to go off to / r/euromigration . 
  go off to / r/euromigration . 
  i 'd like to add my two cents but i 've got nothing . 
  this is like some kind of boob cleavage show . 
  i love it . 
  was someone heckling there just before georgia went black ? 
  just to be clear here , i 'm not the `` this guy '' the parent is talking about . 
  struggling with the poe 's law here ... 
  so even when it 's not their fault it 's their fault . 
  it 's just anecdotal but there seems to be a very large number of train suicides here recently . 
  i 've been wondering the same thing a lot lately , not just because i 'm a commuter but , it must be a really horrible way to die . 
  found [ this ] ( http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2011/05/railways_to_take_action_on_sui.php ) from last year . 
  reminds me of [ this ad ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmotpivxji8 ) for language courses . 
  an oldie but a goodie . 
   so would you say that we 'd be better off without these advances ? 
   would you prefer to live as our ancestors did 100,000 years ago ? 
  of course not . 
  not all competition is worthwhile is all i said , you agree . 
  now i do n't know what we 're discussing at all . 
   this is a very silly conversation . 
  bobzer said that it 's fine `` until it becomes us vs them '' ... then you 're replying to the wrong person . 
  i did not say what bobzer said . 
   competition is a core feature of human advancement .
