bravo, 
  dirty bugger , i am proud, 
  there is a double e , giyf . 
  you spelt it wrong lad , basically confirms it . 
  a `` free stater '' does n't refer to everyone in the south , eejit . 
  yet people defend them all the time , even over the bloody sunday and ballymurphy massacres, 
  absolute gobshite , no arguing with free staters . 
  then do n't voice your bullshit opinions if you do n't care to be challenged . 
  you are jumping through all sorts of mental gymnast hoops to come off as an asshole . 
  we 're irish from the island of ireland and the opinions of free staters does n't change that . 
  could say the exact same thing about the disgusting terroristic acts of the british army, 
  i 'll get over it when the british government admits to its collusion with loyalist death squads that murdered my countrymen or finally punishes the members of the british army that slaughtered civilians at places like derry or ballymurphy  maybe then relations can be properly normalised but until then , no , i will not get over it . 
  thanks very much from tyrone . 
  to me it 's all ireland . 
  it never entered the english language as a phrase until the british imperialist john dee politicised it and used it to lay claim to ireland though . 
  ah sure it was only cromwell , he was the only the bad thing the british did in ireland , not as if they assisted death squads in the north less than 30 years ago or anything or had their army shoot civil rights protesters . 
  there is britain and ireland , no ` british isles ' . 
  so the ` british isles ' is a political term then ? 
  ireland is the name of the island and is geographical . 
  if you want to be specific it 's ` northern ireland ' and the ` republic of ireland ' . 
  also we did n't christen it the ` irish sea ' , you lot did ; call it the manx sea , i actually prefer that name . 
  it 's our language now too , we 'll do what we want with it , 
  you are british , i have no illusions that you are continuing to do it solely to annoy us . 
  the term was brought into the english language during the tudor period by john dee to express english claim over ireland and ` legitimise ' it ; it was crafted solely for political purposes but now neither the irish government or the british government use it for official purposes . 
  we do n't like the term and the irish government does n't use it either . 
  to us british isles is just britain and its smaller islands . 
  they look delicious, 
  `` official ira '' , inla , and the provisional ira ( many would consider the provisionals the true ira ) are gone or ceased activities . 
  the dissident `` real ira '' and the continuity ira are still around along with a few other organisations ; the continuity ira split from the provisionals after the ceasefire in 1994 and the `` real ira '' split from the provisionals after the ceasefire in 1997 . edit : the continuity ira actually came about in a split in the 1986 over sinn f\u00e9in 's decision to end abstentionism in the south and take their seats in d\u00e1il \u00c9ireann but did n't take part in paramilitary activites until the pira ceasefire of 1994 .

  it was a war and a dirty one ; a war your government was mostly responsible for . 
  denying people civil rights for over 50 years and violently attacking them , eventually slaughtering them with your army tends to bring about a blowback . 
  ca n't defend everything the ira did of course but they 're in power sharing now and we are n't being discriminated against in our own country . 
  pretty please, 
  yes it began on april 19 , 1775 :\\ ^ ), 
  the loyalists favourite word, 
   they can be compared to daesh is this the new godwins law ? 
  the troubles started in '69 to be fair . 
  the ira made a resurgence to protect nationalists from loyalist mobs , but they did n't get real support behind them until the ballymurphy ( 1971 ) and bloody sunday ( 1972 ) massacres at the hands of the british army . 
  yes there was british state security collusion with loyalist paramilitaries to murder their own citizens https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles#collusion_between_british_forces_and_loyalists, 
  are you going to answer him ? 
  this was state-terrorism your country was involved in, 
  same could be said for your army a thousandfold . 
  it 's a shame they did n't have the logistics your army did but they fought with what they could . 
  maybe your country should n't have denied us civil rights for so long , or colluded with loyalist murder gangs eh ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles#casualties https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles#collusion_between_british_forces_and_loyalists check the citations . 
  actually the british army and the loyalists that they aided and abetted killed the most civilians . 
  the ira overall killed mostly british security forces . 
  the ira was a reactionary organisation . 
  if your nation had n't denied civil rights to us for over 60 years and violently cracked down on protesters when they demanded them there would n't have been a need for the ira . 
  your country murdered more civilians than the ira ever did and that was just during the troubles . 
  the british state is culpable for the massacres they carried out and the loyalist murders by aiding and abetting them . 
  at least now you know you ca n't walk all over us like you did in the past and are n't treated like second class citizens due to the actions of the ira . 
  fuck the british army , colluding terrorist scumbags . 
  killed more civilians than they did ira . 
  pathetic . 
  oh aye , just noticed the username . 
  the guy who said `` ireland is n't a real country '' . 
  did you know your army and their lackeys the loyalist paramilitaries ( who were not considered terrorists up until the 90 's , and who your army colluded with ) killed the most civilians throughout that conflict ( basically shooting random catholics in the street ) , and the troubles was a war your country started by cracking down on civil rights protesters ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles#casualties https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_troubles#collusion_between_british_forces_and_loyalists, 
  brits out !, 
  grumble, 
  as it is i support it , yet if the eu insists on heading down any such federalised or militaristic route i want no hand in it and would rather we leave - * if * we fail to prevent it . 
  as far as i 'm concerned our neutrality should be sacred . 
  only way i 'd pick up a gun for my country is in defence of it . 
  seems to cause arsepain in some british people too , they get so defensive of the term for * some * reason . 
  british * & * irish isles, 
  funny that the hungarians joke about the scots of all people . 
  no , it 's all-or-nothing , in my opinion . 
  i would n't want to abandon the other counties , like the 26 did . 
  it 's a good stick to beat unionists/loyalists with though , when they try to argue that the partition of ireland was justified ; switch their logic back on them and all they 'd have is antrim and down . 
  glad to see her sticking to her guns . 
  if the uk gets to have their cake and eat it too it 'll only fuel more euroscepticsm and convince them that they can reach a similar deal for their country as well . 
  would unionists be ok with some individual counties splitting off from `` northern ireland '' and joining the republic ? 
  it 's by that very arbitrary reason ni was formed in the first place , even though both tyrone and fermanagh at the time still had irish nationalist majorities , so i 'd only see further british hypocrisy if they refused . 
  i hear it , i upboat, 
  the british never gave ulster its name lol but it 's one of the few cross-community identities here . 
  no , it just means i 'm from ulster . 
  i 'm an irish republican . 
  what are you confused about ? 
  congratulations germany , hopefully i live long enough to see our goal come to fruition too . 
  what do you even mean by this ? 
  i 'm irish and i live in tyrone , which of course is in ulster . 
  it 's my ancestral land . 
  not necessarily , i 'm from tyrone and would n't in a million years identify myself as ` northern irish ' ; only irish . 
  it 's not even a real nationality . 
  yeah , we do n't agree with that to be fair , too political . 
  it 's the british & irish isles . 
  the british isles is britain and its tootsy wee islands , ireland not among them fortunately . 
  unless you can find someway to make us identify with britain , their queen , and the union jack , i fear the union is untenable for most people of nationalist backgrounds . 
  any who are in favour of the union and are of a nationalist background are nothing but economic unionists , and if you ask them they 'd prefer long-term reunification . 
  also going to have to start making irish culture , including language , more welcome in the uk ; as it stands many of us feel like foreigners in our own country . 
   unity ( thanks for the spell check btw ) wo n't happen do n't be so sure of yourself ; probably should n't have signed up to the good friday agreement to be fair . 
  ha , bigoted cunt . 
  go to britain if you want to be british so badly , or at least accept that half the population of this place do n't identify with that island to the east . 
  this is ireland and always will be . 
  you ca n't be an ulsterman without being an irishman . 
  i find stating `` northern ireland '' equally as `` provocative '' ; i identify with the irish nation , as a whole , personally , not the uk . 
  i 'm not going to shit up the thread over it though if the title does say `` northern ireland '' . 
  i like you op tal32,
