they were n't labelled as humanitarian , the humanitarian convoy is parked in a field near a border town for the moment . 
  the convoy that was destroyed ( partially ) consisted of apcs and soft skin troop transports ( that were n't spray painted white like the humanitarian convoy ) . 
  this applies to intra-country usage as well . 
  no european citizen/customer can be charged more than $ 0.20 / mb for using data in the eu , regardless of whether they are abroad or not . 
  the last few limits aimed at cutting down roaming charges actually brought down domestic irish text rates ( which would 've been over the new limit ) . 
  the us would definitely be opposed to it . 
  look how hard they have fought for the [ petrodollar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petrodollar_warfare ) . 
  every time iran and venezuela push for the opec to switch to the euro the us moves strongly against it . 
  maybe if the energy union was only for gas the us would acquiesce . 
  done quite a while ago . 
  [ european petroleum reserves ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_strategic_petroleum_reserves#european_union ), 
  [ really ? 
  but estonia and lithuania are : [ northern europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_europe ) '' a united nations report published in 2011 defines northern europe as including the following ten countries and dependent regions : denmark ( with faroe islands ) , ** estonia ** , finland ( with \u00c5land ) , iceland , ** latvia ** , ** lithuania ** , norway ( svalbard and jan mayen ) , republic of ireland , sweden , and the united kingdom ( with guernsey , isle of man and jersey ) . '', 
   and since you will not show any such evidences since they do not exist my argument still stands that southern & eastern countries are receiving more money then what they are contributing except italy at the cost of the western & northern countries . 
  spain and portugal ( and iceland ) are the most westerly countries in europe , yet look at their economies . 
  ireland is a country that is both a northern and western european nation and it required a troika bailout just like greece which is at the opposite end of the continent . 
  for the last point [ this report ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union#net_contributors_and_recipients ) was the best i could find although it is out of date ( 2009 ) i ca n't seem to find a more recent report from a reputable source where eu revenue is broken down by country . 
  from a quick glance in 2009 : 1 . 
  `` western '' belgium received twice as much as `` eastern '' bulgaria . 
  lithuania ( `` northern '' as stated above ) received $ 200 million less than `` southern '' romania ( which is in roughly the same latitude as slovenia , croatia and hungary ) 3 . 
  cyprus the most southern eu nation and yet it is a net contributor . 
  at this stage the whole north vs south thing is like [ `` i before e except after c '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i_before_e_except_after_c ) : it is a rule of thumb with too many exceptions to actually be useful . 
  [ no true sctosman fallacy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_true_scotsman ) * statement one : * northern countries `` feed '' southern ones . 
  * rebuttal : * lithuania , estonia and poland are among the biggest recipients . 
  * statement two : * they ( lithuania , estonia and poland ) are n't true northern countries . 
  really it 's not a north vs. south thing . 
  it 's also not an east vs. west thing either as the eastern economies are among the fastest growing economies in the eu whilst spain is stagnant and has high unemployment . 
  i think the two groups you are trying to identify are : ** group 1 : ** the richest countries ( benelux , scandinavia , germany ) ** group 2 : ** the poorer countries ( greece , spain , romania ) and furthermore it seems it 's the richest countries who are paying the most while the poorest countries are receiving the most . 
  i wonder why ? 
  not for speculators though . 
  a large once-off fee of 3-9 % is more effective against people who are only going to own the house for a year or two than a yearly fee that 's 0.18 % to 0.25 % . 
  this is in terms of discouraging a housing bubble though . 
  in terms of long-term revenue for the government i agree a property tax is better . 
  where in the paper ? 
  i 'm pretty sure we owe a lot less than $ 1.6 trillion . 
  if we did our gdp to debt ratio would be 761 % . 
  we actually owe ~ 160-180 billion euro . 
  to get sovereign debt in the trillions you 'd be looking at italy , currently at $ 1.9 trillion ( the troika would not have been able to bail them out ) . 
  edit : just checked google says its 117.4 % of gdp which would be $ 179.8 billion edit 2 : just saw the hyperlink to the independent there . 
  well `` we '' as the taxpayers do n't owe 1.6 trillion , it says in the paper $ 877bn is owed by private companies and another $ 277.3 bn is owed by the banks directly . 
  we actually had a 3-9 % `` stamp duty '' ( depending on price ) on all residential properties throughout the boom years and we only reduced it in 2010 to help first time buyers . 
  this meant a house bought for $ 650,000 in 2005 ( which was very common 3 bed apartments in dublin were selling for $ 800 000 at the height of the boom ) , an extra stamp duty of $ 58,500 was paid by the buyer . 
  at the same time the seller paid 20 % capital gains tax on the profit . 
  in 2005 between cgt and stamp duty the government took in $ 3 500\u00a0000\u00a0000 , almost 10 % of the entire tax take for 2005 . 
  it kinda explains how we got into a budget deficit so quickly when the housing bubble popped . 
  perhaps the [ personal insolvency act ? 
  ] ( http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/personal_finance/debt/personal_insolvency/personal_insolvency_options.html ) although i do n't see how this would affect businesses , it was introduced in 2012 to help with the number of people with unaffordable mortgages and failing businesses . 
  but what does that have to do with mass shootings ? 
  gun control i 'm ambivalent on , america has a problem with mass shootings and shootings in general that it is not addressing and commentators like you are n't helping by sweeping it under the rug by saying `` well america 's a big country '' . 
  a national conversation must be had on how to deal with mental health issues and gangs in order to combat these shootings . 
  i do n't follow . 
  are you saying that mass murders happen more often in wide open sparsely populated areas ? 
  because i would think it 's easily to kill a lot of people when they 're densely packed together . 
  you know , like they are in europe . 
  and yet comparing it to europe it 's both smaller geographically and has a lower population . 
   for instance ireland as a country would be utterly crushed and suffer far more than the uk or europe as a whole . 
  i really wish people would stop spreading this idea that ireland depends on the uk for its continued economic growth or that it would collapse if a brexit were to occur . 
  ireland exports twice as much to the usa than it does to the uk . 
  it exports over three times the amount to the euro zone than it does to the uk . 
  in fact in terms of exports , ireland exports more to belgium than the uk . 
  britain exports more to ireland than it imports . 
  in purely trade terms it would lose out if barriers to trade were put in place . 
  in terms of imports britain is a bit more prominent but still only represents under a quarter of ireland 's imports compared to the rest of the eu 's  35 % share or the usa 's 14.6 % share . 
  overall ireland has a net trade deficit with the uk of about $ 3 billion compared to an overall trade surplus of $ 44 billion with the world as a whole . 
  between imports and exports ireland does $ 30 billion worth of trade with the uk compared to over $ 178 billion worth of trade with the world as a whole . 
  at this stage ireland is more dependent on the eu or america that it is on the uk . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/gei/goodsexportsandimportsdecember2015/ ) i 'm not arguing a brexit would n't impact the irish economy but it would n't cause ireland to enter a recession either . 
  with 7.8 % gdp growth last year , unemployment falling , and the fiscal deficit also falling , the irish economy is in a very different position than it was 3 years ago . 
  i would argue that the trade effects would pale in comparison to the problems that would spring up in northern ireland ( already you have a very strong `` remain '' vote from the nationalist parties and `` leave '' vote from some of the unionist parties ) . 
  if the common travel area was compromised during the brexit the cost of security forces in northern ireland could rise again . 
  if there are barriers to trade ( as you seem to suggest in your post ) then the uk would have to install customs checkpoints to prevent smuggling from ireland to northern ireland . 
  the symbolism of this would cause huge tension between unionists and nationalists . 
  but besides all this one only needs to look at the [ common travel area ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_travel_area#freedom_of_movement ) to see that ireland and the uk will almost always try to accomodate each other :  british citizens in ireland . 
   under irish law , all british citizens -- including manx people and channel islanders who are not entitled to take advantage of the european union 's freedom of movement provisions -- are exempt from immigration control and immune from deportation . 
  [ 49 ] they are entitled to live in ireland without any restrictions or conditions [ 50 ] they have , with limited exceptions , [ 51 ] never been treated as foreigners under irish law , having never been subject to the aliens act 1935 or to any orders made under that act . 
  [ 50 ] british citizens can thus move to ireland to live , work or retire and unlike other eu citizens , they are not required to demonstrate having sufficient resources or have private health insurance in order to retire . 
  this is due to the fact that british citizens are also entitled to use irish public services on the same basis as irish citizens in ireland . 
  [ 50 ]  irish citizens in britain  before 1949 , all irish citizens were considered under british law to be british subjects . 
  [ 52 ] after ireland left the commonwealth of nations in that year , british law was amended to give irish citizens a similar status to commonwealth citizens in the united kingdom , notwithstanding that they had ceased to be such . 
  thus , much like british citizens in ireland , irish citizens in the united kingdom have never been treated like foreigners . 
  irish citizens have , however , like commonwealth citizens , been subject to immigration control in britain since the enactment of the commonwealth immigrants act 1962 . 
  unlike commonwealth citizens , irish citizens have generally not been subject to entry control in the united kingdom and , if they move to the uk , are considered to have ` settled status ' ( a status that goes beyond indefinite leave to remain ) . 
  they may be subject to deportation from the uk upon the same lines as other european economic area nationals . 
  [ 53 ] in february 2007 the british government announced that a specially lenient procedure would apply to the deportation of irish citizens compared to the procedure for other european economic area nationals . 
  [ 54 ] [ 55 ] as a result , irish nationals are not routinely considered for deportation from the uk when they are released from prison . 
  [ done ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/ireland-to-close-double-irish-tax-loophole-1413295755 ) about a year and a half ago , though i think existing companies have until 2020 to comply . 
  edit : since some of the story is behind a paywall ,  ireland will change its tax code to require that all irish-registered companies be tax residents in ireland within the next six years , slowly ending a tax-optimization structure known as the `` double irish , '' irish finance minister michael noonan said in a parliamentary address to introduce the 2015 budget . 
  [ according to the irish examiner ] ( http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/apple-manufacturing-at-the-core-of-cork-presence-333879.html ) it is a manufacturing ( or at least assembling ) plant . 
  :  the only apple-owned manufacturing facility in the world ,  the imac manufacturing facility in hollyhill edit : [ picture ] ( http://www.irishexaminer.com/remote/media.central.ie/media/images/a/applehqcorkexam010615f_large.jpg?width=648&amp;s=ie-333879 ), 
  probably ireland look at his post history . 
  ( also boomierboom has a celtic tiger ring to it ), 
  [ nope ] ( http://www.ifsc.ie/listing.aspx?id=239 )  more than 430 international operations are approved to trade in the ifsc , while a further 700 managed entities are approved to carry on business under the ifsc programme . 
  hardly thousands of postbox addresses not even one and a half thousand if you check the a-z listing you 'll see most of the businesses have separate addresses in dublin and trade in the ifsc . 
  they are not registered there as their legal address . 
  the companies that are registered there are not all in one building . 
  the ifsc is n't one building or even complex of buildings ; it 's far more than the block of towers you see on the news . 
  [ the ifsc comprises the area between memorial road , amiens street , lower sheriff street ( including part of crinan strand ) , guild street , and the river liffey along north wall quay and custom house quay ] ( http://steeleandco.com/images/campus_location%5b1%5d.gif ) . 
  [ the overall area is now 15.8 hectares and accommodates almost 2,000,000 sq ft ( 184,000 sq m ) of office space ] ( http://www.ifsc.ie/page.aspx?idpage=6 ) . 
  i 'd be surprised if there ** was n't ** hundreds of companies in it , very few businesses could afford all that prime office space to themselves ( especially in the centre of dublin ) . 
  a few hundred companies over 2 million square feet seems reasonable to me , unlike [ corporation trust center ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporation_trust_center ) in delaware :  the corporation trust center , 1209 north orange street , is a ** single-story building ** located in the brandywine neighborhood of wilmington , delaware , usa .
