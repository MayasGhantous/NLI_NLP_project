  they do n't even seem sure what we would be suing them over . 
  sepp 's dickish reaction is the one the rt\u00c9 just suggested on the six one news . 
  should there be a cut off percentage for tax paying to decide who can vote ? 
  i 've grown up seeing people vote along civil war lines regardless of current party policies . 
  i 've had 30 year olds admit to me that they did n't know who or what was on a ballot until they got to the polling station . 
  yet some of these same people have told me that 16 is too young . 
  they wo n't understand the issues or know the topics . 
  i was debating politics at age 10 . 
  i see no good reason why a 16 year old would be any more or less informed than other voters . 
  [ ireland is in the same boat ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/rail_gauge_world.png ) , although being an island with no planned tunnel/bridge it 's not so much of a problem for us . 
  it 'll take a massive increase in flying costs to make a crossing economically viable , but one could be built for more touchy-feely reasons sooner . 
  that bbc article claims a bridge on one of the northern routes could cost as little as 3.5 billion ( no doubt optimistic ) . 
  it could be sold very effectively to [ some ] ( http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/building-bridges-literally-unionists-plan-for-link-between-scotland-and-ulster.125169474 ) for romantic `` british '' ideals . 
  i mean , our [ rail network is n't great ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/ireland_rail_network_sb.svg ) , and it 's [ obviously not as good as it once was ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/map_rail_ireland_viceregal_commission_1906.jpg/753px-map_rail_ireland_viceregal_commission_1906.jpg ) , but even by [ bus ] ( http://www.buseireann.ie/pdf/1360856510-networkmap.pdf ) it would n't take 20 hours to get around the island . 
  he had no rail data for us , so he used walking pace for the country . 
  he should 've left us blank . 
  the person who made this map did n't have data for irish trains , hence why it shows limerick being about 12 hours from dublin , when it 's more like 3.5 or 4 . 
  driving you 'd do it in 3 mostly legally , 2.5 if you 're feeling lucky . 
  no fair !, 
  they 're used to it !, 
  we basically grant citizenship to anyone with an irish grandparent . 
  some ( no doubt optimistic ) estimates put that at about 70,000,000 possible irish citizens . 
  we only have like 4,500,000 citizens in the country . 
  do you use something like dia dhuit as well ? 
  i know it 's not a perfect translation meaning wise , but in practice it fulfils the same lexical space . 
  i have seen `` haigh '' and `` h\u00e9 '' used casually . 
  t\u00e1 is the present tense of to be . 
  think of it as the question being phrased `` are you in agreement with the following change ? '', 
  answer : [ i ] am / am not . 
  the wording used in irish is [ * an bhfuil t\u00fa ag toilu leis an togra chun ... * ] ( http://refcom2015.ie/ga/polling-day-ie/ ) ... 
  which literally means `` are you in agreement with this amendment that ... '' the answer to your question could easily be `` i did [ go home ] '' as well as `` i went '' , although in english `` i did '' sounds a lot more natural than i went due to the phrasing of the question . 
  plenty of college kids have their vote at home . 
  this one again ? 
  croatian , serbian and bosnian are all separate languages yet irish , scots gaelic and manx are all one . 
  sure it 's pretty , but accurate it is not . 
  why 'd you spoil your vote ? 
  it is , but it 's more common in hiberno-english than american or british . 
  it sort of carries over to hiberno-english . 
  often people will respond with the verb instead of yes or no , although that 's a lot less common than it once was . 
  the irish independent is also often very tabloidy . 
  an idea is n't much good though , unless something is done with it . 
  i though in london 's case it was poor people , a sizeable group of which were black people ? 
  [ sure it was here first ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltimore,_county_cork ), 
  figure from the last census , from largest to smallest : czechs : 6,732,104 others/undeclared : 2,742,669 moravians : 522,474 slovaks : 149,140 ukrainians : 53,603 poles : 39,269 vietnamese : 29,825 germans : 18,772 russians : 18,021 silesians : 12,231 hungarians : 9,049 romani : 5,199 total : 10,562,214 according to wikipedia , many people boycotted the last censuses nationality question , hence the large others group . 
  look at north korea . 
  it can be a shitty place that would n't be a good place to send back refugees to , even if there is no day to day war-related violence . 
  i think ireland and the uk might be due to northern ireland , and the situation there . 
  [ civil union is more than just a term in ireland , it has legal differences with marriage . 
  ] ( http://www.marriagequality.ie/getinformed/marriage.html ), 
  in fairness , some of the people campaigning against this also campaigned against legalising divorce in [ the 90s . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fifteenth_amendment_of_the_constitution_of_ireland ), 
  poppy is for all british war dead now though is n't it ? 
  maybe we 'll finally get good kebabs . 
   the overall volume of taxation did n't go up by a lot `` volume '' is n't really an economic term , but i 'm assuming you mean amount . 
  no , it did n't go up , it went down quite a lot . 
  in ** 2007 the government had a total income of ** [ ** $ 47,887 million ** ] ( http://www.finance.gov.ie/what-we-do/public-finances/data-reporting/exchequer/end-december-2007-exchequer-statement ) , the next year it was [ 40,777 million ] ( http://www.finance.gov.ie/sites/default/files/excheqstatdec08.pdf ) . 
  ** in 2010 that was down to ** [ ** $ 31,000 million ** ] ( http://www.finance.gov.ie/sites/default/files/enddecstatement.pdf ) by 2014 it was back up to [ 41,000 million ] ( http://www.finance.gov.ie/sites/default/files/exchequer%20statement%20end%20dec%202014_0.pdf ) . 
  look at [ the table ] ( http://www.eapn.ie/eapn/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/total-tax-collected-in-ireland-2004-2008.jpg ) on this [ page ] ( http://www.eapn.ie/eapn/policy/resources-on-taxation/sources-of-tax-revenue ) ( uses different figures , i think it 's in dollars , not euros as claimed ) . 
  notice the fall offs in vat , corporation tax and excise ( fall in consumer confidence ) , then notice the massive drop offs in stamp duty and capital gains . 
  that 's the arse falling out of the property sector . 
   no recessionary tax hikes what do you mean by this ? 
  as in taxes raised during a recession ? 
  there were quite a few tax hikes : usc , income tax went up and others . 
  do you mean that it was only progressive taxes that were raised ? 
  i 'm not sure that 's the case , but certainly there has been one very obvious regressive `` tax '' introduced , albeit recently : water charges . 
  the ecb did n't give ireland a 4 % growth rate . 
  economic reforms ( from the ecb but also the imf and others ) and an improving global economy gave us a 4 % growth rate . 
  do n't we have that because of the banks ? 
  after several years of harsh austerity , tax rises and emigration . 
  people often feel that the culture of a subreddit is disrupted and damaged by growth . 
  i wonder do they count people who only move out `` part time '' . 
  next year , if i get my course i 'll be moving , but my parents will be paying for most ( if not all ) and i 'll be home pretty often , to the extent that saying i `` live '' in the place i 'll move to might be a stretch . 
  you got in a car with a drunk person ? 
  i 've never ran into guards on a night out , but i have n't heard any stories either , so i think they 're pretty lax about it , so long as you 're not taking the piss . 
  actually i did run into a guard on a night out . 
  i was with a few friends getting some pizza , he had a bike with him . 
  a few young boys ( maybe 9-11 years old ? ), 
  were messing with him , touching his bike , saying `` do you have to arrest me now guard ? '', 
  `` look guard i 'm assulting him '' . 
  he just kept threatening them ( in a good natured fashion ) , saying he 'd wallop one , or drag him home to his mammy and see what she thought . 
  our limit for full drivers is 50mg per 100mls , and 20mg for all other drivers . 
  although you really should n't be driving after having a drink . 
  i 've heard the claim ( probably untrue mind ) that most police forces are tasked with `` upholding the law '' , worths here , being as they are guards/garda \u00ed , they are tasked with `` keeping the peace '' . 
  so if they find you drunk off your hole on pana they 'll take you home or put you in a taxi as opposed to bringing you in to anglesea st. 
  and you cost us the football . 
  let 's let bygones be bygones . 
  rockall would be nice this time of year . 
  i kinda like the french . 
  should irish not be dark green ? 
  i ca n't think of a word with a soft c , only hard cs . 
  she certainly could . 
  the union did n't win by a comfortable margin at all in the referendum , and if the tories swing right or `` waspy '' to pick up ukip votes and leave scotland hanging , we could see another referendum within 10 years . 
  this sounds absurd . 
  in fairness they as a singular pronoun is n't common in all dialects . 
  i think you just need some kind of photo identification though , like a drivers license , not necessarily a passport . 
  except the northern irish parties , as sinn f\u00e9in refused , so the unionists were n't invited for balance . 
  that and it 's the main religion that people have experience of being in . 
  most people are still raised `` catholic '' , although that often means they 'll do the sacraments and come to the odd christmas mass . 
  is n't it a wexford thing ? 
  god , tubs is embarrassing .
