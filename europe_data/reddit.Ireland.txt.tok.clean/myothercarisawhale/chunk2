   look you 're not making them stateless they have their own country it is called isis . 
  then the uk have to recognise isis as a state , which causes other problems , and will piss off most of the middle east . 
  besides , how has isis granted them citizenship ? 
  do they have little black passports ? 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  the uk ca n't call isis a state while not calling them a state !, 
  funnily enough , as an irish person whenever i 've been to the uk i 've seen the police ( birmingham airport ) or soldiers ( london ) with guns . 
  i 've never seen a garda with one . 
  are n't those world heritage sites ? 
  these are natural heritage sites . 
  although i always thought the burren was on the list , largest karst landscape in europe and all that . 
   eu-27  croatia what the hell ? 
  no ireland ? 
  what 's going on here ? 
  is there something you have n't been telling us europe !, 
  irish citizens are . 
  she is a refugee , and did n't have access to funds . 
  i 'd say they 're worse , but that 's little consolation in cases like these . 
  surely one would have much of the negotiations before succession ? 
  i could be wrong here , but is n't there some economic requirements for joining the eu ? 
  government debt and such ? 
  not necessarily . 
  that can all be negotiated . 
  is that really so different from now ? 
  how much of a say does scotland actually have in how the pound works ? 
  he 's changed the picture now . 
  shame the new one does n't include county hall or the elysian , but at least it includes shandon . 
  why are n't portugal and spain more linked up ? 
  you 're probably right , and anyway there would probably be a stop or two on the way , slowing things down further , but one can dream . 
  i was talking about two separate hypothetical routes . 
  besides , cork goes into heuston , while belfast goes into connolly . 
  linking them up would be difficult . 
  could you imagine a high speed between cork and dublin ? 
  the line is [ 266km ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin%e2%80%93cork_railway_line#about ) long . 
  the tgv does 300km/h + in places . 
  dublin to cork in 50 minutes ? 
  that 's fecking commutable !, 
  in some ways though the more realistic route is dublin-belfast . 
  i ca n't find a figure on how long the current route is , but lets guess it as 180km . 
  it 's about 150km by road . 
  ahh . 
  it would be wonderful . 
   how can one decided was it a hate crime or not ? 
  it 's up to the courts to decide . 
  there can be pretty gray cases , but there are also pretty obvious ones . 
  they 're loyalists , so yeah , brits . 
  if it was just that then northern ireland would n't be so bad . 
  but yeah , stuff like that . 
  i think it 's supposed to be a nicer , non-sectarian mural , a let 's - all-get-along sort of thing . 
  either that or a nationalist mural protesting all those racist loyalist groups . 
  it 's vk.com , a social network popular in ukraine and other areas ( mainly ex-ussr places ) . 
  the post has been taken down , but here is [ strelkov 's page ] ( https://vk.com/strelkov_info ), 
   teach your employees , or better yet citizens , on how to use email encryption and invest in open-source backdoor-free software . 
  to play devils advocate , how can you know that it 's backdoor free ? 
  how can you know that the cryptograpic method has n't been broken ? 
  that sounds absurdly inefficient . 
  so , what is the operational difference ? 
  if someone 's house is burgled who deals with it ? 
  ( irish ) republicans identify with palestine , while unionists identify with israel , in the enemy of my enemy is my friend sort of way . 
  ireland itself does n't have all that friendly a relationship with israel . 
  not at all !, 
  i only knew [ one of his songs ] ( http://www.google.ie/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ccmqyckwaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dmvcgsqpz4em%26feature%3dkp&amp;ei=yljcu53ee8th7aaknicabq&amp;usg=afqjcnhcngzdgpusa0egikngnswqr7mhlq&amp;bvm=bv.70810081,d.zgu ) before all this , and did n't even know who sang it . 
  his last studio album was released almost a decade ago sure . 
  well , that depends , is he identifiable as an immigrant or catholic ? 
  they 're related , but not mutually intelligible , not by a long shot !, 
  irish ( also manx and scottish gaelic ) is a [ goidelic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goidelic_languages ) language , cornish , welsh and breton are [ brythonic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brythonic_languages ) languages . 
  both are branches of celtic languages . 
  almost all signs are bilingual . 
  all schools teach it , some just teach in irish . 
  most people i know can speak irish to some degree , but i come from a fairly middle-class area and school , so i 'm not exactly representative of the entire country . 
  i do n't know how widely spoken welsh is , but to my understanding a lot more people speak welsh in everyday settings than speak irish . 
  well , our constitution is written in irish , and i could have said that in irish , but that would n't have made much sense on this , a principally english speaking forum . 
  and yet ye went and wrote your constitution in it ... 
   we are not publicizing details of this [ military ] ** plan ** . 
  it should be a nasty surprise for the terrorists . 
  for a second i thought they were going to gas or nuke them . 
  would make the news very interesting were they to . 
   most voters in the european elections voted for right wing parties . 
  do you have any evidence for that ? 
  what 's your definition of `` right-wing '' ? 
  / r/europe does n't really deal with such local touristic issues , so you 're probably better off with more local subs . 
   i hear pickpockets are a problem in amsterdam ? 
  that 's pretty much the case with every city in the world , or at least it 's said about most . 
  standard precautions should always be adhered to . 
  / r/amsterdam has a pretty extensive wiki for tourist information : [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/amsterdam/wiki/index ) . 
  / r/hamburg seems pretty friendly towards tourist inquiries , judging by the [ current top post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/hamburg/comments/2a53xe/ein_tag_in_hamburg/ ) anyway . 
  also as a small correction , one should say travelling ** to ** amsterdam . 
  i did something similar , again unintentionally . 
  i had a bottle of water and a can of coke . 
  completely forgot about them . 
  for some mad reason the guy who saw the x-ray was n't the one who preformed the search . 
  some other guy did it , found the water , did n't find the coke . 
  this was through french security . 
  you do know that that happens a lot , and is a political statement right ? 
  title and graph do n't quite match . 
  anti-eu = / = radical right . 
  in ireland it is a left-leaning party that is our main eurosceptic party . 
  in fact , i do n't think we really have a notable far right movement . 
  to be fair , / u/dngrs did n't say that they were waiting for the problem to solve itself , he stated that external factors could solve the problem . 
   reform the senate , to be elected directly by the people .
