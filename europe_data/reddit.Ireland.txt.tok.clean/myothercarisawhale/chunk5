  might want to make it a little clearer that this is ireland . 
  the smoking ban has a 97 % compliance rate ? 
  how is that figure derived ? 
  i 've never seen someone smoking indoors since the introduction of the ban . 
  thats true . 
  we really have n't had a good national argument for having an upper house . 
  however , as i said before i do think we need one as i think that our current political system , while it is no longer controlled by civil war politics , is still far too parochial . 
  i 'd like some sort of upper house that could even that out a little . 
  maybe with a list system , or some sort of technocratic system . 
  certainly i do not believe that the taoiseach should be able to pick a sixth of the members of what is supposed to be a check on his power . 
  and while we are a unitary state , you can not ignore some of the large differences that this country has . 
  dublin can at times feel like a completely different country form the rest of us . 
  the west of the country is much poorer than the east . 
  we still do not have decent transport links down the western coast . 
  dublin is the only city with a decent intra-urban public transport system aside from buses . 
  to be fair , scotland , wales and northern ireland are n't great examples , what with having the whole uk thing . 
  i personally would like to have a ( functioning ) upper house . 
  i think that our current political system , while it is no longer controlled by civil war politics , is still far too parochial . 
  currently when a government gets into power its only limit is the constitution . 
  and i do n't believe our constitution to be perfect . 
  [ we 're getting there though !, 
  ] ( http://www.corkrebelweek2013.com/the-rebel-passport ), 
  this is one of two referendums that took place yesterday . 
  the other one was on whether or not to establish a `` court of appeal '' . 
  the seanad ( irish senate ) is a basically powerless body . 
  the taioseach gets to pick 11 of the 60 seanad\u00f3ir\u00ed . 
  the rest are elected through [ various means ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seanad_%c3%89ireann#composition ) . 
  many people here , in fact i would say most , want it to be reformed . 
  their views differ on what should be done . 
  there is no serious movement with clear ideals on what a reformed seanad should look like . 
  people feel that it is undemocratic and that it serves as a ` stable ' ( as in horses ) or retirement home for failed tds ( irish mps ) . 
  it has produced some excellent politicans , but also some appaling ones , such as this [ we-need-to-stop-these-teenagers-with-their-facebook-raping ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f2vfjuo6ra ) one . 
  here 's a few other links : [ here 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1nsdvb/seanad_referendum_rejected_by_42500_votes_483_yes/ ) the / r/ireland page on the referendum result . 
  here 's a few irish news sources talking about it : [ ** the irish times ** ' frontpage is dedicated to referendum coverage as of now ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/ ) ( about 18:20 irish time . 
  there is another referendum as well ( whether or not to establish a court of appeal ) on , so this might change ) [ ** the irish independent ** liveblog ] ( http://www.independent.ie/blog/live-blog-the-referendum-counts-as-they-happen-29634816.html ), 
  ... the big big movie is on every weekend . 
  i think the christmas day one is called the big big christmas day movie or something . 
  thats kinda sweet . 
  all the families , gathered around , watching the big big movie . 
  ** ireland ** clare won the all-ireland ( in hurling ) !!!!, 
  also a ( bankrupt ) developer was found to have about $ 200k hidden around his house . 
  c\u00e1r as do robert ? 
  wait till you see what it was like before !, 
  dublin used to be 23 minutes and a few seconds behind london !, 
  is the irish one something along the lines of the language of a people is its health ? 
  that 's a rather nice piece . 
  it gives me hope that other countries plagued by war can rebuild and move on eventually . 
  we got two in the first one , if your definition of an irish city includes belfast and derry that is . 
  absolutely gutted . 
  we only got two cities on this list . 
  ** ireland ** we do have full length movies , many of which are known , but here i 'd like to focus on some short films , in irish . 
  [ c\u00e1ca milis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uleuaxtpmf4 ) a dark tale of a women who has had enough . 
  not for those with weak stomachs [ yu ming is ainm dom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqytg9bnhfm ) a lad decides to leave his home country . 
  [ in\u00edon an fhiacl\u00f3ra ] ( http://www.thisisirishfilm.ie/shorts/inion-an-fhiaclora ) a dark tale set in a rural town ... some interesting acting going on . 
  all have subtitles , and are fairly easy to understand . 
  that ... that does n't make any sense !, 
  even if eyestrain was such a problem what help would a day off every two months do ? 
  fixed now . 
  charles de ~ ~ gall ~ ~ gaulle is linked by an rer line , which is the commuter train service . 
  besides the difference in cost and network the rer and metro pretty similar . 
  yeah , them . 
  it comes down to what people recognise as legitimate . 
  i 'd recognise a referendum that achieved a majority for independence . 
  i 'm sure most countries would require spain to accept catalonia 's independence for it to be `` legitimate '' . 
  others might require other states to recognise catalonia before they recognise it . 
  in recent history ( i 'm going by last 10 years ) yes ... but it has n't had much in terms of challenges in this time period . 
  scotland is still in the works , it could end badly or well . 
  in the long-term history ( last 500 years ) britain has done rather appallingly . 
  and is n't he involved with that anti-owl crowd ? 
  where 's the allegation of `` slave labour '' coming from ? 
  did ryanair refuse to pay her ? 
  pay her below what was agreed ? 
  pay below what the law allowed ? 
  did it force her to work when she should n't have had to ? 
  all the article seems to allege is that they use some ... interesting business packages . 
  that alone does not equal slave labour . 
  i do n't like this idea . 
  if we had such a force i think we 'd have far too many people who 'd want to put it to use to police the world . 
  by all means encourage co-operation and maybe some sort of joint border defense , but not any sort of combined military . 
  i 've never had the wheel or brakes fail in any car i 've been in . 
  although i have experiance the brakes not working due to ice or slippery road conditions . 
  in contrast , i 've had gps devices fail on a weekly basis . 
  they 've positioned me on a nearby minor road instead of the road i was traveling on . 
  they 've failed to connect to any satellite source at all . 
  they 've mis-calculated my altitude . 
  the article does suggest that these limiters would be adaptive . 
  so on most motorways they 'd allow up to 120km/h , but on autobahn routes with no speed limits they could be disabled . 
  although this is a ridiculous article . 
  it does n't deal with any of the possible pitfalls of such a device , or even what happens in other countries . 
  could you imagine if the speed limiter got it wrong and limited you to say 30km/h on a motorway ? 
  fixed . 
  *** ireland *** # ** priory hall death ** one of the ` residents ' of priory hall died by suicide during the week . 
  it has cause the issue to be back in the headlines . 
  priory hall was/is a residential complex in dublin . 
  in october 2011 , shortly after people started living in it , it was discovered that it was dangerously unsafe . 
  the whole building was a fire hazard . 
  the residents were all ordered to move out , immediately . 
  so , these people have had no home for a good while now . 
  dublin city council , who had been ordered to provide housing for the people is now pursuing a case in the high court to free them of this obligation . 
  as far as i know no work has been done to fix the building to date .
