  ** the electric picnic ** the electric picnic is on this weekend . 
  its a massive festival that takes place over three days in ~ ~ offaly ~ ~ laois ( thanks gigsy ) . 
  unfortunately there has been one or two incidents . 
  a man died yesterday , for unknown reasons , although its suspected that he had a preexisting medical condition ( he had a heart transplant as a baby ) . 
  a warning about contaminated ecstasy has also been issued . 
  ** death in namibia ** [ a former garda \\ ( policeman \\ ) was killed in namibia . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/former-garda-killed-in-namibia-29542206.html ) ** 1913 lockout commemorations ** a commemoration of the 193 lockout , the biggest labour action ever to take place on this island took place this week . 
  a wreath and red roses were laid at the statue of jim larkin ( the trade unionist of his day ) by the president ( himself a former labour party man ) and various trade unionists from around europe . 
  the red rose is of course the symbol of socialist international . 
  ** and finally , the biggest , and arguably saddest news of the week , the death of seamus heaney . 
  ** a nobel prize winner and irishman , the bane of many a junior certs studies , seamus heaney passed away this week after a short illness . 
  he was 74 . 
  some of his poems include [ digging ] ( http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/177017 ) , and my favourite poem , [ mid-term break ] ( http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/seamus_heaney/poems/12698 ), 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_ireland#name  the constitution of ireland provides that '' [ t ] he name of the state is \u00c9ire , or , in the english language , ireland '' . 
   under irish statute law , republic of ireland ( or poblacht na h\u00c9ireann in irish ) is '' ** the description of the state ** '' [ 15 ] but is not its official name . 
  ... [ t ] he name of the state in english remained ireland . 
  its not . 
  `` republic of ireland '' is the official ** description ** of the state . 
  ireland is the official ** name ** of the state . 
  they 've pretty much always done it . 
  they 're not likely to change anytime soon . 
  donate to a charity that helps them then . 
  i think it is wrong to give money to people begging . 
  by all means , give them food or help where you can , but not money . 
  but why wont they ? 
  the article never explains that . 
  is he some sort of folk hero ? 
  or is the government invested in him somehow ? 
  why is n't it becoming compliant though ? 
  is it just on oversight ? 
  or are they looking for soemthing ? 
  why did croatia change its law ? 
  we have those as well , although we call them 2 +1 roads . 
  so , doing a search for portugese motorways i get [ this map ] ( http://www.amoita.com/sites/default/files/adminfolder/portugal%20motorway%20map.jpg ) . 
  that does seem to be quite a lot of motorways . 
  are they all proper motorways ? 
  like 120 kmh ^ -1 ? 
  cheap/free entry into museams such as the [ pompidou centre ] ( http://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/your-visit-visit#166 ) in paris ? 
  centra , and londis . 
  superquinn is going though . 
  its being rolled in to supervalu, 
  do n't forget centra !, 
  is londis still around ? 
  i think she asked for irish consular help . 
  if she did it would be interesting to know if she identified as irish or british up til now . 
  its not too hard , but its still another language . 
  they 're not mutually intelligible or anything , they just have a similar grammatical structure , and some words are the same . 
  you forgot yer one with the drugs in peru . 
  three . 
  could someone please explain to me the difference between private debt and sovereign debt ? 
  does anyone have a link to info on the rest of the eu ? 
  talking about the superiority of french culture . 
  its not raining !, 
  jokes a german would n't make . 
  that 's a back country trail ? 
  the main cork-limerick road is worse than that some of the way . 
  he threatened to invade , and gave us shit for staying out of the war . 
  he 's not liked in ireland either . 
  do n't forget made the isle of mann !, 
  i fear that such a military would be used outside europe . 
  i have no desire to see my country involved in battles in countries around the world , or wars of aggression . 
  i believe that such a power structure would be able to ignore public opinion on military intervention even more than the us and uk governments in the lead up to the iraq invasion . 
  any common eu force should take the role as a purely defensive co-operation pact . 
  by this i mean governments should have systems in place to work with each other in the event of a major multinational attack ( say , a co-ordinated terrorist attack ) . 
  possibly border defense . 
  i did n't know that liam neeson fought in ww1 ... 
  invention of the submarine !, 
  thejournal.ie for ireland , although they might have missed it when it happened . 
  exactly . 
  drones can be used in many different ways . 
  i for one am not okay with weaponised drones , but i have no problem with drones used for environmental monitoring or entertainment purposes . 
  so , cen sort aimsir ata tu ? 
  i did n't make the map , but my source was [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1j0nkv/twitter_activity_of_european_governments_oc/cb9wvnw ), 
  just official government twitter account . 
  if you were to include ministers and other such civil servants most countries would have tweet counts in the hundreds to thousands . 
   why have n't we integrate [ d ] our defence forces ? 
  because certain countries keep going to war ( looking at you uk , france and the nato countries ), 
  its too hot for that sort of thing . 
  i voted yes in the hope that such a country will join the euro , and that certain websites ( looking at you amazon ) will acknowledge that there are countries that use the euro and speak english . 
  i think that he 's still getting over 600k from rte alone . 
  that 's still 100k more than the public sector pay limit . 
  he 's getting paid more than anyone in the public sector can be ( in theory ... ) . 
  doctors , high ranking diplomats etc. 
  who decides whats more important ? 
  what happens when they decide that pandora is more important than spotify ? 
  or due to a new deal with bing , its is placed higher than google ? 
  you say `` a bit '' . 
  what happens when they decide to completely block certain high use applications during peak time ? 
  say internet videos and large downloads . 
  steam , netflix , youtube , linux sites , etc. 
  people would be even more annoyed at the pay that certain people are payed . 
  ryan tubridy for instance was paid over 700,000 for 2011 . 
  similar story for others . 
  if it was funded by the exchequer people would demand that costs fall , which rte does n't want . 
  it should be noted that they were told in advance that they would not be allowed threw in the evening . 
  they were allowed march through in the morning , but the parades commission said they could n't march back through the area , as these pricks go and get drunk then start trouble on the way back . 
  after the fleg riots and now this i 'm scared that there might actually be a group of extreme unionists who do feel that the appropriate way to get their view across is through violence . 
  confusion over whether or not its `` the ukraine '' holodromer . 
  and stuff that was in a short history of tractors in ukrania . 
  that 's about it .
