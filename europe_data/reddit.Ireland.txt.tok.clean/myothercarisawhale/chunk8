  i went by people per police officer . 
  [ here 's a pastebin of the data i used ] ( http://pastebin.com/rbyr0f6a ) . 
  in that hungary comes out at almost 1150 people per police officer . 
  whats wrong with it ? 
  the data i used had the number of police officers at 8724 . 
  the population i had was 10,014,324 . 
  these figures were for 2010 . 
  i used this : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/product?code=demo_pjan&amp;language=en&amp;mode=view and this : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/product?code=crim_plce&amp;language=en&amp;mode=view, 
  well , i used a slightly different method from this chart , but in my [ map ] ( http://imgur.com/hdnctrv ) there does appear to be a weak trend . 
  in what way ? 
  they 're outliers . 
  they should come up at a different colour . 
  the way i worked it out was i took the population of the country ( in 2010 , based on [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/product?code=demo_pjan&amp;language=en&amp;mode=view ) ) and divided it by the number of police officers that that country had ( [ based on this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/product?code=crim_plce&amp;language=en&amp;mode=view ) ) . 
  norway and finland ended up at over 600 + . 
  the next country was denmark at just under 500 . 
  then there 's a ( somewhat ) smooth progression down until the final 3 or four countries , i.e. 
  it has no other drops of greater than 15 points . 
  they should be noticeably different from the other countries . 
  although the colours i used might not have been the best . 
  thanks !, 
  [ here 's one i threw together in google docs . 
  uk got messed up . 
  docs apparently wont let you treat ni/scot/wales / eng as separate countries . 
  missing data from greece and macedonia . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/qfuvpof ) hungary really comes up as an outlier , i wonder if that 's a mistake . 
  i 'm using 2010 as the year . 
  [ here 's the spreadsheet i used , in tab-separated format .

  i also removed hungary , as it seemed to be too weird . 
  where are you getting your figures from ? 
  i 'd just like to see how other countries compare . 
  in my experience most want rid of it . 
  it is seen as a waste of money , and somewhat undemocratic . 
  i believe that it needs to be reformed . 
  i do n't think that it should be kept in its current form . 
  it does n't have much power and is seen as a waste of money . 
  the standard comment about it is that its a retirement home for failed politicians/tds ( teachta d\u00e1la = mps ), 
  an t-uachtaran does not have that power . 
  all the city buses where i am only have the one door . 
  the front door . 
  so you have to pass the driver . 
  although according to / u/oon4321 there are some new ones with middle doors for getting off . 
  have n't seen any though , maybe dublin bus has them . 
  which ones are these ? 
  i have n't seen them around where i am ( cork ) . 
  the group i was with barely acknowledged the driver . 
  i was in koeln , so they had some fancy ticket system . 
  all the driver did was drive . 
  machines handled the tickets . 
  that 's pretty cold man . 
  i posted it at a bad time . 
  give it a few hours , then we 'll see . 
  you ever thanked a shop employee after he gave you your change ? 
  they vary from about a 25 seater to like 75 standing/seating . 
  they all only have one door though , so you always pass the bus driver . 
  not thanking the bus driver in germany . 
  it just felt weird not to when i was over there , yet none of the germans that i was with did it . 
  those langers in the youtube video thing !, 
  i ran about 8 klicks in 40 minutes . 
  i 'm not amazing , but i 'm okay . 
   up to half of pubs face closure due to financial difficulties , again ? 
  this seems to have happened a lot over the last few years ... 
  what now ? 
  also , cork city marathon today . 
  't was great craic . 
  ran the relay in it myself . 
  tried to help us out in the famine . 
  sent shiploads of food to drogheda . 
  so , pretty positive here . 
  that 's a very light brown bread . 
  are you one of the eyp istanbul youth conferencer-thing-ers ? 
  if it 's due to the eu then why is it that it is ireland and the netherlands that are used to avail of this tax avoidance system ? 
  why not portugal and belgium ? 
  ireland , the netherlands and the us have different tax codes , and rates , and it is by taking advantage of the differences that these companies can avoid taxes . 
  its a little bit more complicated than just `` being the eu 's fault '' . 
  compared to ireland especially . 
  this map makes ireland appear much more densely populated than germany . 
  i wonder what how they compare in terms of users of twitter ? 
  i did n't vote for bertie to be accused of being a communist !, 
  that 's sinn f\u00e9in talk !,

  the main language of reddit as a whole is english . 
  the people who frequent an english-speaking site are more likely to be able to speak it . 
  basically , the most likely common language that nay two people on reddit will share is english , so most of this sub 's discussion takes place in english . 
  also , non-english links often do n't do well , as people are n't as likely to understand them . 
  if i put up a video in irish few would understand it . 
  people generally do n't upvote what they do n't understand . 
  however , this sub is n't monolingual . 
  every so often a news article will be posted , and reach the top in a non-english language . 
  they are frequent comment discussions in other languages as well . 
   ireland ' in the case of this article refers to the country known as the republic of ireland , as it has colloquially around the world for the past 90 years . 
  the republic is basically just used by the beeb for political correctness . 
  the country 's name is ireland , before that \u00c9ire , and before that the irish free state ( saorstat eireann ), 
  is it ( land/property ) really that bad in greece ? 
  or is this hyped up ? 
   no whores in the vincinity though . 
  [ something , something , that 's cause your mom is at my house ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/im14andthisisfunny ), 
  seriously , it was 14 ^ o last tuesday , everyone i know went to the beach !, 
  so , are we going to see , like a vodafone eu mobile network , with no uk/ie/es / it etc ? 
  or is this more of a backend thing ?
