  if you joined your coins could have that aul wan on them . 
  it would come across as pretty elitist though . 
  our president said somethings that some people took offense at . 
  something about how the economy is n't doing great . 
  the state buses are on strike . 
  bus eireann workers have gone on strike , they protesting about some new reforms . 
  finally , today is the national famine commemoration . 
  it does have some correlation though . 
  i imagine that it would turn out something like a u ( n ? ), 
  shaped graph , you know in the form ( ax ^ 2 ) + bx + c. 
  inner city areas being poor and outer country areas also being poor , but suburban areas being wealthy . 
  i 've always been surprised that the unionists up north have never pushed for a tunnel or bridge to connect belfast to scotland . 
  ryanair would have a fit . 
  lets do it !, 
  i find it very hard to believe . 
  i do n't know of anyone who even knows about this service existing in ireland , let alone using it . 
  its not like we have ads on the telly advertising it or anything . 
  for ireland i 'd guess that out high prices are due to : a ) being an island , making it hard/expensive to import electricity . 
  as far as i know we can only buy from the uk . 
  i do n't think that we have any direct links to mainland europe . 
  b ) not having massive indigineous power sources . 
  unlike the uk we do n't have massive ( known ) oil/gas fields . 
  wind , while plentiful , is somewhat new and expensive . 
  peat seems to be a little bit ... protected . 
  of course , the fact that we had a monopoly in the energy sector for like ... 60 years may have contributed to this issue , but i 'm not so sure . 
  i believe that dr. oetker says this ? 
  or at least something like this ? 
  to be fair , you went down the road of a genocidal religious fanatic to lead your republic .

  maybe ... 
   a nominal declaration of war would have been enough - or would that have been too much to risk ? 
  why should ireland have let itself become a battleground for england and germany ? 
  why should ireland have gone to war with germany ? 
  germany had been a lot nicer to ireland over the years than the british . 
  do they ? 
  none of my filipino friends speak spanish , just tagalog and english . 
  spanish is spoken somewhat widely . 
  mandarin does seem very concentrated though . 
  like basically just china concentrated . 
  spanish is on what ... 3 continents ? 
  s+n . 
  america , europe ( , asia ? ), 
  warning : with ryanair be prepared . 
  make sure you have your ticket printed out in advance , and that you 're luggage is underweight etc. 
  if you miss anything you will be fucked by them . 
  the article lists some reasons https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mine_flail#modern_use namely : cost : its pretty expensive vunrebility : its vulnerable to anti-tank mines effectivity : old mines may fail to detonate under the flails, 
  well , some of the people who identify as `` british '' would trace their ancestry back to the plantation of ulster , and therefore would be of british descent . 
  rugby is also pretty popular . 
  national government . 
  maybe he should n't have used the term eu , european would 've been better . 
  but to a certain degree that is the case . 
  i 'll give it a shot : british banks made risky loans to irish banks , exacerbating the situation . 
  the irish taxpayer is now being forced to pay for the brits recklessness , in order to `` prevent contagion '' . 
  how 's that ? 
  to be clear , i 'm not saying that this is definitely the case . 
  the financial regulator clearly fucked up over here , and plenty of other countries were involved . 
  but property tax is supposed to pay for local things . 
  it wont go towards the deficit , at least not directly . 
  all of the examples you mentioned are operated nationally for the most part . 
  policing is done by an garda siochana , water is being taken over by some semi-state body that 'll charge us feckloads to benefit the jackeens . 
  road maintence is covered by the county and city councils . 
  the property tax itself has n't started yet . 
  the valuations have afaik . 
  however last year there was a precursor `` charge '' called the household charge , which was a flat rate of $ 100 on each house ( with some exceptions ), 
  please tell me it was a joke proposal . 
  she did n't really try and pursure it , did she ? 
  i thought zionism means , and has always meant a philosophy supporting a jewish state ? 
  what did it mean ? 
  or has it changed ? 
  as an aside : gerry adams statement on her :  margaret thatcher did great hurt to the irish and british people during her time as british prime minister . 
  working class communities were devastated in britain because of her policies . 
  her role in international affairs was equally belligerent whether in support of the chilean dictator pinochet , her opposition to sanctions against apartheid south africa ; and her support for the khmer rouge . 
  here in ireland her espousal of old draconian militaristic policies prolonged the war and caused great suffering . 
  she embraced censorship , collusion and the killing of citizens by covert operations , including the targeting of solicitors like pat finucane , alongside more open military operations and refused to recognise the rights of citizens to vote for parties of their choice . 
  her failed efforts to criminalise the republican struggle and the political prisoners is part of her legacy . 
  it should be noted that in complete contradiction of her public posturing , she authorised a back channel of communications with the sinn f\u00e9in leadership but failed to act on the logic of this . 
  unfortunately she was faced with weak irish governments who failed to oppose her securocrat agenda or to enlist international support in defence of citizens in the north . 
  margaret thatcher will be especially remembered for her shameful role during the epic hunger strikes of 1980 and ' 81 . 
  her irish policy failed miserably . 
  there really is nothing like immersion to learn a language . 
  my school runs a german exchnage programme ( one of the reason i actually picked german over french actually . ), 
  and it really showed me the power of immersion . 
  within three days i was able to stop the tedious translate sentence to german from english , and start thinking in german . 
  it was great . 
  i did french for my jc , so i can understand a little . 
  mostly road directions at this stage . 
  i kept german on . 
  i 'm okay at it . 
  nowhere near fluent though . 
  my irish is pretty good though !, 
  you can fix it with punctuation !, 
  `` mike !, 
  drive the car right now ! '', 
  is there any sort of site that allows you to test ?
