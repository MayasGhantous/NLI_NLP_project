guys you can just down vote him and not attempt to correct them . 
  maybe he 's trolling and maybe he 's just ignorant ( and there is nothing wrong with a * little * ignorance ), 
  i think one of the most malicious things the government has done is try and pass this off as an environmentalist thing . 
  as if it would save water every year . 
  have they looked outside lately ? 
  its not like we 're short of water coming from the sky !, 
  and some people have quote 49 % of water being lost by the pipes before it reaches houses . 
  in addition to that the pipes are dangerous . 
  a friend of mine had half her family give lead sickness a few years back from their water and they live in suburban dublin . 
  and they want to charge us how much for it ? 
  tallinn - helsinki is also about 100km too .

  this is a fantasy high speed network . 
  surely anything is possible then . 
  nah it 's cool . 
  us irish do n't want to take a high speed train anywhere anyway . 
  new york cops have a quota of stop and searches they have to do . 
  dont they ? 
  if you 're respectable and nice to them though they rarely do . 
  they 're more likely to just leave you off . 
  easy up there buddy . 
  were just having a little chat this isnt an on-air tv debate . 
  no need for the rampant passion or name calling, 
  we already have a president that does just that with limited power . 
  would it be so different calling micheal d king ? 
  i would n't mind a totally powerless monarch . 
  more of a novelty like . 
  be grand calling some lad mo r\u00ed . 
   gaidhealtachd wow i was not aware there was a gaeltacht equivalent in scotland . 
  it should be an r\u00edocht aontaithe , not riochta , as in the uk , should n't it ? 
  great britain is an bhreatain mh\u00f3r ( i think ) for the rest it 's ... * england = sasana * scotland = albain * northern ireland = thuaisceart \u00c9ireann * wales = an bhreatain bheag ( little britian ), 
  yes , come , bring your delicious money . 
  buy our wool and pharmaceuticals . 
  wow did n't know there would be so many ports on the coast !!,

  i though it would be a lot lower . 
  sure it feels like it here anyway, 
  thank god were in the process of getting rid of them . 
  i have one actually . 
  one of the last printed . 
  was rooting through a load of stuff in the attic and found a card addressed to my brother from 1990 ( he was just born ) with a # 1 note in it in mint condition . 
  needless to say i did n't tell him and kept it myself . 
  its pretty cool . 
  an european union sounds wrong somehow . 
  i like not having to call it the `` pound '' though seemed so ... . arbitrary ? 
  that said though the word `` punt '' is still one my favorites ... . funny that . 
  the guinness store house just added 27 new vats for production .

  nothing beats a f ** king cup\u00e1n tae . 
  i love the fields of athenry nothing better than hearing 80,000 fans belting that out also [ come out , ye black and tans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/come_out,_ye_black_and_tans ) is also popular if were feeling particularly patriotic . 
  there are a lot of old irish folk songs we can choses from . 
  really ? 
  i love `` flower of scotland '' . 
  easily my favorite anthem of the 6 nations maybe of europe . 
  jokes ? 
  sure a kerry man does n't know his right from his left . 
  as a european i can confirm that europe is older than the us . 
  i disagree . 
  berlin was one of the highlights of my trip lots of interesting things to do , the food was fantastic , increadable nightlife and getting lost and having the craic in the city was a treat .

  perhaps in a geographical sence . 
  like dem der on the continent but the does n't make us any less politically european . 
  well not in my experience anyway almost everyone i know would idenitfy as european i would have thought . 
  maybe not the older generation as much and i dont know about you but i 've grown up with the eu firmly rooted as an important instution and one that we are part of and owe a lot to . 
  not so much in ireland i would think . 
  not i was making a small joke . 
  in europe 100 years is nothing . 
  there are probebly a lot of 100 years old houses here . 
  i actually remember being in boston i think , i was young , and the tour guide on the bus we took says something like and if you look over there thats the old mill standing for over 120 years . 
  all the other tourists went ooooh and my dad just blares out . 
  is that it ? 
  its 120 years old and that makes it note worthy ? 
  my house is nearly 100 years old . 
  you want some pictures ? 
  just make sure you can keep them in line . 
  we would n't want any rioting over something as silly as a flag for example . 
  you just wait we 'll keep pumping you full of our beer , potatoes and pharmaceuticals and then well see whos conscious and running europe . 
  yeah where 's our recognition . 
  dont worry its cool . 
  you can do the oil thing for a while if you want . 
  its just a phase . 
  fuck that dont drag us down with you . 
  im a proud european . 
  ulster is not britian . 
  if that was rule the uk then it would work . 
  you might say its aweffaly . 
  this is what jumped into my head as soon as i read your question . 
  its a lot to do with the ira and is very gritty .
