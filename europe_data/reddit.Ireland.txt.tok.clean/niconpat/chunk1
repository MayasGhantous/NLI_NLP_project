within the irish republic , there are no major disputes . 
  dublin is generally disliked by the rest of the country because it 's the major population center and hub of political/economic activity . 
  but same goes for most capital cities in other countries i think . 
  the biggest disputes are usually in the form of a leinster/munster rugby match ( there are 4 provincial rugby teams ) , or gaa football/hurling match ( especially if dublin is involved ) . 
  but even then , things rarely get more heated than some friendly ( ish ) verbal abuse . 
  if we 're talking about the whole island , things get just a slight bit more complicated . 
  but you asked about internal disputes so i wont get into that , 
  interesting !, 
  i 've read about basque connections to ireland before but never knew of the galician/portuguese link . 
  did you know portuguese is lexically the closest non-celtic language to irish ? 
  it suprised me .

  do n't be sorry . 
  irish is technically our native language . 
  english is the second official language in ireland . 
  english is not native to ireland though . 
  irish is our national language . 
   the rest of the ~ ~ country ~ ~ island . 
  careful now !, 
  i prefer the italian version . 
  this year 's canadian iec visas will be available soon so that should do the trick , 
  bigmac meal *, 
  has to be reaching the quarter finals of the 1990 world cup , beating romania in penalties . 
  [ winning penalty kick ] ( http://youtu.be/8-aahfmnqae?t=13m31s ) it 's maybe not our best sporting achievement , but at the time it was massive for the country and everyone went fucking nuts for at least a week . 
  some say it basically kick started the celtic tiger economy . 
  yup , and we have [ horses in carriages ] ( https://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0917/728543-horse-luas/ ) too . 
  if ireland and scotland both win their last two games and scotland win the playoffs we could have the the whole of the uk and ireland in the finals , which would be nuts !, 
  you 're right in saying it 's pretty much ireland or scotland , but there 's a chance !, 
  it 's mostly a myth . 
  it probably did happen to some degree but not on any significant scale . 
  the origins of `` black irish '' is most likely due to movement of hunter-gatherers from iberia . 
  strong dna links between ireland and the basque region have been identified in studies . 
  [ you have until next monday ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/certificate-of-irishness-scrapped-2277181-aug2015/?utm_source=shortlink ) or we ca n't accept you . 
  it 's because one of the mods here is french . 
  ah you 're grand so , most words are the same as in the uk . 
  hmmm , well since third level education is ( mostly ) free in ireland for irish citizens , not many study abroad and especially not in the uk where the fees are relatively high . 
  good idea . 
  another tip , do n't tell us what you call x or y in the states either , we probably already know . 
  especially these : ** us/ireland ** : cookie - biscuit biscuit - scone fries - chips chips - crisps jello - jelly jelly - jam sidewalk - path/footpath trunk - boot stickshift - car gas - petrol/diesel faucet - tap bathroom/restroom - toilet, 
  distilling any spirits without a license is still illegal . 
  poit\u00edn has traditionally been homemade hence the `` illegal '' tag associated with it . 
  no laws have changed , but some licensed companies now make and sell it legally . 
  i do n't think there 's a specific reason we do n't have them , i suppose we 've just never really needed them . 
  non-eu immigrants get a '' registration certificate '' card that they have to show when asked . 
  you can now get [ credit-card sized passports ] ( https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/new-credit-card-sized-passport-will-allow-travel-within-eu-1.2079757 ) if you travel a lot in europe . 
  other than that , we get by fine with regular passports/driving license/social services cards etc. 
  i agree , but it 's less pissy than most other mass produced beers . 
  craft beers are gaining popularity in ireland right now ( well in dublin anyway ) , so stout drinkers are seeing the light when it comes to guinness vs. an actual good stout . 
  our surnames are usually anglicised irish names . 
  here 's the top 5 with the original version and a quick meaning . 
  ( the \u00d3 in our names means `` descended from '' ) ** murphy ** ( \u00d3 murchadh ^ irish ) ( * sea battlers * ) ** kelly ** ( \u00d3 ceallaigh ^ irish ) ( * bright-headed * ) ** o'sullivan ** ( \u00d3 s\u00faileabh\u00e1in ^ irish ) ( * hawk-eyed/one-eyed * ) ** walsh ** ( le waleys ^ norman ) ( * welshmen * ) ** o'brien ** ( \u00d3 briain ^ irish ) ( * noblemen * ), 
  no , tropical storms are large depressions that form in tropical regions and gain their energy from warm water . 
  we do n't get tropical storms in europe . 
  we sometimes get the remnants of tropical storms , which by the time they reach europe have lost their `` tropical '' characteristics and are called `` extra-tropical storms '' but what europe has been experiencing lately are thunderstorms caused by the very hot air over europe colliding with cooler air , mostly from the atlantic and are not cyclonic on a large scale like extra-tropicals depressions are . 
  although some severe thunderstorms called `` supercells '' do rotate in their local space and can cause tornadoes . 
  indeed , they 're basically huge balloons . 
  if it was n't tied down properly somebody 's going to get gross negligence manslaughter charges against them . 
  hmm , that is strange alright . 
  freak wind gusts out of nowhere do happen sometimes though . 
  were there any heavy rain showers or thunderstorms/showers in eesti today ? 
  they can cause isolated strong winds from the downdraft that would n't necessarily be picked up by official weather stations . 
  i agree , but it 's also obvious he 's baiting for controversy . 
  ahh , that explains it then !, 
  cheers . 
  [ top o ' the mornin ' to ya !, 
  learn english in an irish accent . 
  we do n't really bother with `` th '' sounds , 
  it 's a weird scottish hybrid accent of some sort , i found it a bit distracting at first too but i got used to it . 
  good video overall . 
  erections are frowned upon in saunas . 
  hey we must respect all european cultural differences too . 
  no need to be sorry , i like it ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  nice follow on double sarcasm , you guys really are catching up !, 
  [ europines ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hkiz1he.jpg ) , solving all of the world 's problems . 
  yes , they would n't be counted as unemployed if they were n't eligible to work . 
  you are , in ireland . 
  yeah sometimes . 
  but when it does n't rain it 's a cause for celebration , 
  maybe i just do n't understand as a native speaker , but i will say accent has no effect on understanding as long as you say the words clearly . 
  do n't worry about accent , it does n't matter . 
  there are shitty american accents , shitty british , shitty australian , shitty irish , that are fucking incomprehensible to most native speakers from any other area , even within the same country . 
  nobody gives a fuck about whether your foreign accent has a slight british or american tone to it , it will be obvious you 're not a native speaker anyway . 
  all we care about is understanding what you say . 
  this comment makes no sense in any way . 
  yes , '' [ switzerland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f4vhlq9.jpg ) '' has it :p, 
  many wealthy spanish families send their kids to the uk and ireland for the summer to learn english . 
  they stay with irish/uk families while there , but during the day after their english lessons they form massive groups and just try their best to annoy people ( they do n't mean to be annoying , they just are like any large group of kids with no parents around ) . 
  swarms of loud as fuck snotty spanish kids from wealthy families invading dublin 's public transport system during the summer . 
  and they all smell strongly of sudocreme for some reason . 
  other than that i love spain . 
  ah ok , i was only joking but that makes sense  in english the word `` lightning '' covers all types , but people mostly say `` fork lightning '' for cloud to ground , and `` sheet lightning '' for between clouds . 
  or if you want to be scientifically correct you use the terms cg lightning ( cloud to ground ) or cc ( cloud to could ) . 
   lightning ( the one you see during storms ) what other type of lightning is there ? 
  lets not get ahead of ourselves . 
  they were voted `` sexiest '' by american women , who love the accent . 
  i think we were voted ugliest in a european poll lol . 
  `` significantly wealthier than their neighbours in the uk '' . . wat ? 
  yeah they 're very anti-immigration in a reddit context . 
  careful now !, 
  it was probably already on the cards but made much easier by waiting for the same sex marriage referendum to pass .
