  male-female marriage could n't have been legally changed into a same sex marriage before the referendum had passed . 
  now any adult can be what they want on any piece of paper at any time . 
  it 's actually quite genius . 
  he ca n't recommend his own country so he does the opposite with the effect of getting loads of comments telling him why he 's wrong and ultimately promoting ireland as a tourist destination , 
  you win the `` best prediction '' award of this thread . 
  hhahahah , dimitry . 
  brilliant . 
  austria voting for themselves . 
  haha good spot :d, 
  latvia : `` i hope you are all really injected '' :d, 
  azerbaijan : `` it was really flow-less , thank you '', 
  i 'm moldova that cleavage . 
  why are they still using french in the eurovision ? 
  i do n't care like , but why ? 
  she looks very like cat deeley, 
  holy shit this is in with a real chance !, 
  would be hilarious if they won . 
  ah the host country 's song now :p, 
  it 's not ok , you 're at a very high risk of various health issues :(, 
  yes for a lot of people the fuck you to the church was an added bonus , but not a factor in their decision . 
  the majority of people in ireland only go to mass if there 's a wedding , funeral or christening . 
  some priests shamefully used these occasions as an opportunity to try to push a no vote on non-religious people . 
  it obviously was n't very effective . 
  maybe a certain country in the the uk could be next ? 
  just about every other country in the world with a functioning met service . 
  also known as uv index , but some people would n't know what that means so they dumb it down in their tweets . 
  he 's talking about non-weighted percentages vs. fptp percentages , not polls vs. final counted percentages . 
  yeah sounds like you 're just in a high traffic area . 
  no excuse for upc though , as they should be providing speeds as advertised 24/7 . 
  ive been with upc for years and always had perfect service . 
  i 'm on 120mb now and always get full speed . 
  i 'm in the s.dublin suburbs though , so that would probably help matters . 
  upc is generally considered the best isp for dublin , while eircom has a terrible reputation . 
  as far as i know , upc uses fttc ( < 300m ) in dublin . 
  use the holoratchet if you need a break , 
  / r/european is a better quality sub . 
  apologies , it 's a long list to look through and i missed you guys . 
  added now at # 27 ,

  definite troll account , check out his comment in another thread . 
  that 's a matter of opinion . 
  another sweeping generalisation . 
  it 's not freely trading if there 's an extra country in between with all the administration costs/freight costs etc involved . 
  free trade is a to c directly . 
  and i do n't see how that would screw ireland anyway . 
  if anything it would be good for ireland as ireland would be the middle man sucking up some revenue . 
  prior to 1707 . 
  the first one sounds western as fuck to me , they sound like [ the jam ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ae1ct5yeuvy ) and [ the police ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbxwrmqw-oe ) put together . 
  listen to those two songs , throw in some polish and you 've got lady pank - kryzysowa narzeczona !, 
  cool song !, 
  aww no [ novi novi novi good ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tclv63q9kl4 ) ? 
  :p nice list there , i 'm enjoying listening to these songs , 
  not my country , but finland has to be this [ loituma - `` ievan polkka '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4om1rqkpiji ) . 
  i know finland is metal as fuck but this is the metal of polka , some serious face melting vocal shredding going on !, 
  for ireland i ca n't decide so i 'll throw in another acapella `` vocal shredding '' style tune with [ liam clancy and luke kelly - the rocky road to dublin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ewanyzvdfs ) . 
  there 's loads of instrumental versions out there too , i like the pogue 's version . 
  i 'm in favour of this idea but rte player ca n't even handle irish traffic . 
  trying to watch ire vs pol last night was painful , constantly buffering and the stream died at least 10 times and you have to sit through the 30 second ad every time you refresh the page ( they do n't allow adblockers ) . 
  it 's always like this and i 'm in dublin with a 120mbit hardwired connection so the problem in definitely on rte 's end . 
  i 've heard similar reports about the bbc player but have never used it personally . 
  i 'd be suprised if it was as completely useless as rte 's pathetic effort though . 
  a bit of an off topic rant i know , but services like rte and bbc player would have to ensure they could handle the extra traffic if geo-blocking was removed . 
  maybe the eu should subsidise bandwidth costs for national broadcasters ? 
  so do we . 
  kitchen roll and toilet roll , makes sense . 
  but when it 's taken off the roll , it 's called toilet paper but the kitchen paper is still called kitchen roll whether it 's on on off the roll . 
  when ireland made it mandatory to have the flag of europe on number ( license ) plates in [ 1999 ] ( http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1999/en/si/0432.html ) . 
  some people in our country are simply ignorant and somewhat backwards . 
  saying '' \u00c9ire '' to these people invokes a knee-jerk reaction that is completely misguided , pathetic and embarrassing . 
  to nederland , sorry for our assholes , sincerely , \u00c9ire . 
  from [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/ecall-time-saved-lives-saved ) : `` as ecall normally ` sleeps ' , it does not allow vehicle tracking outside emergencies . '', 
  privacy is always a concern with this type of technology , but i imagine ( and hope ) that in this case integrity would be maintained . 
  then it wo n't work obviously . 
  but those cases will be very rare . 
  good news . 
  for anybody wondering , [ how ecall technology works ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/ecall-time-saved-lives-saved ), 
  that looks pretty orderly to me :\\, 
  http://www.osijek031.com/osijek.php?page=6 probably my favorite thing the internet has ever produced . 
  pathetic attempt , better luck next time !, 
  we let you win in the cricket , is n't that enough ? 
  they just fly our flag the wrong way around . 
  disrespectful :p, 
  our cricket is confusing them , 
  lol , we have fucking loads in common . 
  we have more in common with the us than we do with most of europe , with only the uk having more in common with us than the us . 
   i think in ireland the perception would be neutral to negative in that we do n't care , some would think it makes the states there seem less european and just as many think they an do what they want . 
  nonsense . 
  i care , ireland is a part of the eu and so are the baltic states . 
  and i think it 's a good thing that us troops are there . 
  people that `` do n't care '' generally do n't care about anything going on outside of their own living room and care more about who 's on x-factor than anything actually happening in the real world , so you ca n't really use them as a source of opinion . 
  also i do n't see how the us troops being there makes the countries `` less european '' ? 
  who would think that ? 
  if anything it makes the eu as whole less european , but that 's also pretty ridiculous too . 
   as a peaceful people i think we have an aversion to loud mouthed yanks taking over the place and we deal with enough of them ( or should i say 1/128th irish people ) here and on st patricks day so wherever they pop up in the world we usually are n't happy about it . 
  tourism is a major part of our economy and the us are the second largest source of visitors so you should be grateful that they 're helping to keep many businesses in the country alive . 
  i welcome all our tourists with open arms and not only for the economy boost , it 's also interesting to talk to people from around the world . 
  and on the `` louthmouthed '' thing , as a whole americans are far more reserved and quiet compared to the irish as tourists . 
  and even if the americans are a bit too loud for your delicate little ears , you could always wear earplugs or avoid tourist areas :p  if we wanted to troll the uk after ww2 maybe we would have invited some soviet or argentinian soldiers over to dance on the border with northern ireland but we did n't because it 's just provocative we did n't because it 's a ridiculous idea and would have been completely unnecessary .
