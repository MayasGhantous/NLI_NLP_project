  it 's irrelevant anyway because the northern ireland conflict was a completely different scenario to the current russian/eastern europe situation . 
   thoughts ? 
  i think you 're either a troll or very ignorant . 
  you certainly do n't represent me as an irish person with your views , and i would suspect the majority of irish people would disagree with your views also . 
  they 're flag colour bros , like us and india , 
  feint * or am i missing a joke here ? 
  he washes his dick in the sink after peeing . 
  enough said . 
  i love watching the fresh off the plane american tourists in dublin figuring it out for the first time . 
  they watch the locals march across the street against a red pedestrian light and then just look at each other in confusion for a while before tentatively placing a toe on the road like they were checking a hot bath , followed by a frenzied rush of terror and excitement to the other side in a fit of laughter . 
  it 's so cute , 
  those dr.oetker pizza 's are awful . 
  [ goodfellas ] ( http://goodfellaspizzas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/thin-hp.jpg ) are the king of shitty frozen pizzas . 
  yeah fuck experimenting with cannabis laws , give them crystal meth !, 
  it 'll be sure to end well . 
  some great aerial video shots of it in [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p2hsliwao0 ) at [ 0:45 ] ( http://youtu.be/2p2hsliwao0?t=45s ) ( directly overhead ) and [ 2:07 ] ( http://youtu.be/2p2hsliwao0?t=2m7s ) ( epic up and over ), 
  well you have killed a lot of us with your motorcycle tt . 
  but it 's your flag we fear the most . 
  yeah maybe , but the point is that out of the 22 % , maybe 1-2 % would consider irish a foreign language . 
  for the vast majority of irish speakers , irish is n't a foreign language . 
  it 's irrelevant anyway as the title was worded wrongly . 
  op even said so himself , 
  yeah op fucked up the title . 
  it should read `` second languages '' . 
  the irish language is called irish or gaeilge , not gaelic . 
  gaelic ( misspelled as geallic in the chart ) is n't a language , it 's a group of languages . 
  * shakes fist pedantically *, 
  it would be great for polandball comics though !, 
  reminds me of ireland , scotland and wales . 
  oh i know things getting better here the past couple of years and emigration is not the only contributing factor to the drop in unemployment . 
  i just found it amusing that there are 10,000 iec visas available this year , most of which will be taken . 
  so just the emigration numbers to one single country ( canada ) this year will single handedly get us into single figures , independent of other emigration and job creation etc. 
  just a casual observation , not trying to rain on our recovery parade , 
  it depends on the context of what you mean by `` world '' . 
  the physical world ie . 
  the planet earth is `` domhan '' . 
  if you look at the dictionary you linked you 'll see it used in this context . 
  `` saol '' can mean world in a non physical sense , like a conceptual world eg . 
  `` my world is falling apart '' or `` the world of modern art '' . 
  in the context of your map , i would say `` domhan '' is definitely more correct . 
  i assume pro stands for [ proto-basque ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proto-basque_language ), 
   we did n't snatch . 
  they latched on to us in the 1920s and would not let go . 
  that 's a cute way of putting it !, 
  they 're not batteries though . 
  ultracapacitors have different applications . 
  it 's a throwback to the days of printed news media , ie . 
  newspapers . 
  the comma in place of the word `` and '' saves valuable headline space on the page . 
   look at what happened in dublin today , this thing affects dublin , oh my god something happened in dublin , the weather is bad in dublin !, 
  oh yeah , and some fella got stabbed in kilkenny or something - rte news . 
  people outside of dublin think there 's a conspiracy against them in the media . 
  do n't you think with 40 % of the population living in the greater dublin area , which holds the center of government and center of the economy , that the majority of news stories would be dublin based ? 
  makes sense to me anyway . 
  and bad weather in dublin is less common than in the west so we 're not used to it . 
  it also affects more people , dublin airport , ferry crossings to the uk and the hub of the countries transport infrastructure . 
  the same force winds from a storm hitting dublin is going to cause a lot more damage , disruption and risk of human harm than in mayo or donegal where they are well used to it . 
  it 's interesting that you bring up the middle eastern sound . 
  there 's a style of unaccompanied solo irish singing called `` sean-n\u00f3s '' ( old-style ) that sounds very similar to arabic music . 
  [ here 's an example ] ( https://youtu.be/fuwvb3yqxba?t=26s ) . 
  yeah it does sound quite similar to hungarian in some ways , especially the `` shhh '' and `` tshh '' sounds . 
  to me dutch sounds like english spoken backwards in a german accent . 
  since most of you here have probably never heard irish been spoken , i 'd be interested to know what other language it might sound like to you , if any ? 
  nailed it !, 
  `` dutch courage '' and `` double dutch '' are common sayings in ireland . 
  `` dutch oven '' and `` dutch rudder '' are another two i can think of but are not as widely known . 
  and btw , there 's also royal dutch beer which is a slightly posher version of dutch gold , 
  happy independence day potato bros < 3, 
  true , it was just a couple of idiots being idiots and every country has them . 
  the rest of the bosnian fans in dublin were great . 
  many of them stayed in the stands after the game and applauded the irish team so i have a lot of respect for that , 
  we had one in ireland too in 1981 [ stardust_fire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stardust_fire ) ( 48 deaths ), 
   entire herds of ultra-small mosquitoes . 
  yes we have [ biting midges ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ceratopogonidae ) which arguably worse than mosquitoes because you ca n't even see them , you just gradually feel yourself being eaten alive . 
  they can fuck up your day , your night , and even your week . 
  the plus side is they do n't carry any human diseases in ireland . 
  a lot of people here mistakenly call them [ midgets ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mihltkgyj58 ) . 
  americans call them no-see-ums . 
  gaelic football is n't just running around with a ball in your hands , the ball is being kicked all the time . 
  anyway it 's our sport and we 'll call it what we want :p, 
  price is not a concern for apple fanboys . 
  in fact they 'll feel even better about themselves if the prices go up . 
  `` those people '' were other banks that had it in their own interest to save the irish banking sector so they would n't lose their debt . 
  they were n't doing us a favour to be nice . 
  nobody in europe gave a fuck about ireland when our `` misfortune '' happened . 
  i 'm sure most were laughing at us . 
  and the `` help '' that we got was mostly in the interests of the eu , not ireland . 
  no phones or cameras allowed in polling stations . 
  both . 
  ireland is small . 
  how do we explain the latvian women being tallest when they have no potato ? 
  you know exactly what happened . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://esa.un.org/miggmgprofiles/indicators/files/isleman.pdf ) 521 south africans in 2013 not really significant at all :d, 
  mostly , and [ significant numbers of south africans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_isle_of_man#ethnic_groups ) supposedly \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  i have one in another room , and yeah it just acts like a radiator . 
  actually hot to the touch . 
  the good thing about the rolling shutters is they are outside of the glass so they do n't bring the heat they trap inside of the room . 
  i suppose they help with both though , as they are outside of the glass so the heat the take from the sun stays outside . 
  my blinds on the inside of the window just act like a kind of solar radiator , hot to the touch on the inside of the glass . 
  the european continentals have those sweet external rolling shutters on their windows though which help keep a lot of the heat out .
