  the houses in the uk/ireland act like heat traps . 
  it 's 26c outside here now , but 31c in this room :(, 
  it is what it is , it 's not supposed to be a beginner 's guide to europe . 
  middlesbrough ? 
  no problem , happy cakeday !, 
  slovenia wears headphones !, 
   was it a hunting rifle ? 
  i 'm sure they found the bullet and it has a caliber comparable to a hunting rifle round . 
   my guess is it maybe was a airrifle/pistol or some kind of small calibre rifle/pistol . 
   at least i think that would explain why nobody was seriously hurt . 
  or maybe the bullet did n't hit anyone ? 
   in austria there was some guy that shot at a bus last year i think , with a co2 pistol . 
  what does that have to do with this incident ? 
  the [ isle of man flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_the_isle_of_man ) looks like the disembodied legs of tt riders neatly arranged in a pool of blood . 
  or the french , check out the [ stade francais rugby jersey ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sjbbelj.jpg ) !, 
  [ our love was on the wing , we had dreams and songs to sing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzmyv6kdutw ), 
  they are vegemite mines . 
  vegemite ore is actually white , it becomes dark brown after being processed . 
   at one point in the late 90s some dublin pubs would open after midnight , but i think that was stopped . 
  some still do it . 
  it 's just not worth it for most . 
   blaming islamic terrorism entirely on america 's shitty foreign policy in the middle east is ridiculous . 
  agreed , especially with the word `` entirely '' being included . 
   this is why blaming islamic terrorism entirely on america 's shitty foreign policy in the middle east is ridiculous . 
  what do you mean by `` this is why '' ? 
  because a suspect is from ubekistan ? 
  does n't make any sense . 
  the [ nuts regions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nomenclature_of_territorial_units_for_statistics ) actually take population into account when defining borders ( the op map is using nuts 2 regions ) . 
  they 're not all of equal population obviously but do try to keep things relatively proportional , nowhere near the 10 or 20 times difference you are suggesting . 
  what 's going on in northwestern spain , especially galicia and asturias ? 
  paradoxically , you can fuck right off . 
  finland in public : 10 meters away from each other fully clothed in the freezing cold . 
  finland in sauna : 10 cm away from another guy 's naked sweaty balls . 
  \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af but who am i to judge , you guys are 6 smarter than me :p, 
  oh i know , i would n't have mentioned it if we were the highest lol :p but seriously , i do n't know anybody in ireland that 's had any kind of `` official '' iq test . 
  we do aptitude tests in school at about 15/16 years old to help guide towards university course choices , but it 's not an iq test . 
  i do n't know if it 's different in other countries . 
  albania is interesting alright . 
   please note : differences of just a few iq points may not be significant due to statistical and sampling errors . 
  most countries on the map are within `` a few iq points '' of each other . 
  we were holding their territory safe until they woke up and got their shit together !, 
  i agree there 's absolutely no reason for it anymore . 
  i especially hate the way it fucks up the natural lengthening of the days in the spring . 
  the difference in daylight hours from day to day around the time of equinoxes is far greater than at solstices , and you really can notice the difference in day length on a relatively short timeframe . 
  when daylight savings comes in the feeling of transition from winter to summer is kind of ruined . 
  oh ok , nice to get a view from a native english speaker . 
  chill , it 's just a prank bro !, 
  `` i 'd like to interrupt this broadcast to tell you this is the best free pen i 've ever received , viva l'italia ! '', 
  true , i understand him better than some native speakers living in my own country . 
  i 'd say heavy accent , and the english was just ok . 
  he pronounced hungarian wrong and said `` start my career '' instead of `` started my career '' as written correctly in the subtitles . 
  it 's not perfect but i 'll give him a break since it 's only one of 32 others !, 
  here 's ireland 's opinion poll . 
  78 % would vote for the uk to remain in the eu . 
  are they crazy ? 
  maybe they 're getting a strong foothold in the market before the inevitable [ geographical shift of great european wine ] ( https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/grape-expectations-for-a-warm-ireland-1.796273 ) . 
  it 's only good for roses , thistles , and daffodils . 
  hold on a sec , i 'm pretty sure we 're a fake economy tax haven that just sponges off the the eu to build roads for google streetview cars that fake images of any real prosperity thus hiding the real situation that we are still in the midst of the great famine living in mud huts with facebook welcome mats . 
  maybe i 'm wrong , i have n't looked out the window in a while . 
  here 's a nice animated visualisation of wind speeds at midday yesterday for comparison . 
  oh , ok then :p in my defence , i 've heard a few people suggest the `` rain catching '' method without thinking of hydro . 
  we can and do harvest it through hydroelectric power plants . 
  they only produce about 6 % of our electricity though because there are many downsides to hydro power . 
  the [ irish terrier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_terrier ) is a ginger too . 
  true , the cycle lanes in dublin are a joke . 
  it was only a joke . 
  i also cycle to work in dublin purely for convenience ( 20 mins cycle vs. 1 hour on the bus ) , even in bad weather . 
  i suppose people to act a bit suprised when i tell them , but more because it 's not the norm , not because it 's `` weird '' . 
  i 'd say about 10 % in my place cycle to work . 
  most people commend it , and say something like `` oh really , fair play to ya '' . 
  they do n't say `` what !? 
  you freak ! , although maybe they think it :p to be honest i think they 're a bit weird for sitting on a packed stuffy bus twice a day for an hour . 
   often people are openly surprised when they learn that i cycle to work , to hobbies , to do my shopping etc. 
  maybe you do n't have a body shape that would suggest you regularly exercise , hence the suprised reactions ? 
  ironically , it 's a situation where humans often treat animals with more humanity than human beings themselves . 
  not related to oliver 's folly ( it was built before the famine ) , but til about [ famine follies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/folly#famine_follies ) . 
  hmmm , not sure how i feel about that . 
  on one hand they were providing starving people a means to earn some cash , but on the other hand the people were starving so lifting boulders all day to create a pointless structure would n't exactly help with the whole caloric deficit thing !, 
  [ connolly 's folly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conolly%27s_folly ) is an impressive looking famine folly . 
   they invented football , but are polite enough to let others win . 
  [ it really would ] ( https://i.imgur.com/bhyd6gb.png ), 
  estimated figures , so more like `` it probably will be second next official count '' . 
  interesting though . 
  i wonder if brexit will cause it to slip back down to third in a few years . 
   their language has almost no connection between the spelling and the pronounciation . 
   they won two world wars in order to ** loose ** the biggest empire in human history . 
  it 's spelt `` lose '' , like nose , hose , rose ... yeah you have a point there . 
  their flag does n't represent wales . 
   the uk is the second most populous state in the eu . 
  [ pretty sure it 's third ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_population ), 
  i 'm triggered by posts that are digging up the past for the sole purpose of starting a comment sewer . 
  why bring this up ? 
  it 's completely irrelevant to this subreddit and the comments will be a disaster zone . 
  we joined [ the nordic battlegroup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_battlegroup ) to stop that type of thing happening again :p, 
  so just bigotry then . 
  ok , carry on . 
  why would you celebrate a failing irish economy ? 
  cabbage potato carrot basil mozzarella tomato, 
  ankara , berlin , zurich * ... what 's the 4th ? 
  yeah i think we were all bit sceptical in ireland at first but lidl and aldi have really infused into irish culture .
