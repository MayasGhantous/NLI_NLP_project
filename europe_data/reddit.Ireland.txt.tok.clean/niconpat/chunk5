  [ `` using cutting edge technology '' ] ( https://youtu.be/5slhzormqmc?t=56s ) :d, 
  that 's not a backface design though , it 's just a face on the back , 
  nah , most countries went for a $ 1/2 , brass , bronze separation of backface designs . 
  of the original eurozone members , we were the only ones with the same backface design for all coins . 
  not sure if any newer members were as lazy . 
   plus trying to figure out where the other coins come from too is fun . 
  exactly , ireland is too easy for that game !, 
  we should 've put the harp on the $ 1 and $ 2 coins only , and some cool celtic style art reminiscent of the old coins for the others . 
  yeah they were sent to every household in ireland . 
  same was done in every other eurozone country i think . 
  i remember a thread with pics of euro changeover calculators from different countries . 
  i miss the design of the irish coins , the 2p in particular has an epic design ( a boat-bird rowing himself ) . 
  pity we went with all harps for the back of our euro coins . 
  the op in the / r/dataisbeautiful thread said he could n't find the data for these cities . 
  he 's just following the taoiseach 's schedule . 
  he 's supposed to follow the schedule , it 's part of the job . 
  it just so happens that he 's gay and the gay pride parade is on at the same time . 
  it 's a complete non-story made into a story by highlighting small coincidences and multiplying it by the dup . 
  that 's like saying ikea is the new classic french furniture of the 21st century . 
  and uk style meat pies are rarely eaten in ireland anyway . 
  we share a lot of cultural food habits with the uk ( fish & chips , full irish/english breakfast , tea ( with milk ) and biscuits ) , but pies are not one of them at all . 
  and to think somebody gets paid to maintain/update that site . 
  [ we do ] ( https://i.imgur.com/br1f79z.jpg ) . 
  although the website itself is a relic from the 90s . 
  i hope varadkar pushes transport infrastructure hard . 
  he 's a former minister of transport so hopefully he 'll understand how important it is . 
  we ca n't have high density in dublin without a major infrastructure upgrade . 
  it 's great for us . 
  we 're a small nation with a huge diaspora around the world , and we generally love to travel and work abroad . 
  it also helps that we 're `` neutral '' . 
  it would be madness to not have dual citizenship here both socially and economically , but i can see how it would n't be ideal in a lot of european countries where the risks would outweigh the benefits . 
  they look so homogeneous . 
  except for the guy on the right with the back foliage , maybe it 's a bear . 
  4 ( knees ) x 55 = 220 + ( 2 characters stoned out of their minds * 100 ( one hundred percent stoned ) ) = 420 . 
  what 's that over erdogan 's right shoulder , looks familiar right ? 
  also a legendary csgo venue , especially with virtus pro winning there on home soil in 2014 . 
  the next big one is in krak\u00f3w though , and virtus pro are not playing well recently :(, 
  true , times flies when you read the article date and believe it because you 're getting older and question your perception of time on a regular basis . 
  thanks , edited it for correct time interval . 
  cuba and ireland have always had a secret friendship . 
  they would have to put him on a bigger bike , just in case he did n't look small enough . 
  funny you should say that . 
  bernie sanders [ met him in dublin last ~ ~ week ~ ~ month ] ( https://www.dailyedge.ie/bernie-sanders-michael-d-3430400-jun2017/ ) and a lot of people thought the same . 
  thank mr. nokia, 
  they 're mostly all chinese parts anyway . 
  there are a few different types of replacement parts ; qc passed oem parts , qc failed oem parts , salvaged parts , fake oem parts , compatible parts etc etc. 
  you 're not going to get a genuine replacement part ( ie . 
  qc passed oem ) in any of those `` phone shops '' , but depending on what part they use for repair it could be as good as new or could be a waste of money . 
  best advice is to use a shop with a good reputation and a warranty if possible . 
  i think they 'll be ok with it , nobody 's gon na come from the middle east shooting up their crops . 
  a naughty young wheat trampler practicing her peasant tickling however ... 
  realistically the percentage of people with a even a basic conversational level of irish is way way lower . 
  `` knowing some irish '' is meaningless . 
  the `` gaelscoil movement '' is simply parents with no choice but to put their kids in irish speaking schools because the english speaking ones are full . 
  i 'm all for keeping the language alive , but pretending it 's popular and force feeding it to children is wrong way to go about it . 
  true , and our met service do n't recognise the older recordings as official . 
  a couple of weeks ago an official station in dublin hit 28.6 c degrees and they declared it as a june record high temperature for that station , even though 28.7 c was `` recorded '' there in june in 1950 . 
  i 'm not sure when their modern official recordings began , but i think it was early 1980s . 
  from the [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/benbulbin ) * benbulbin was shaped during the ice age , when ireland was under glaciers . 
  originally it was a large plateau . 
  glaciers moving from the northeast to southwest shaped it into its present distinct formation . 
  * its a bit vague , but i suppose it 's the glacier equivalent of islands in rivers , ie . 
  formed by the flow following the path of least resistance . 
  that just got me thinking , during the 80s/90s you used to see loads of cars from mainland europe on irish roads during the summer . 
  mostly from france , germany and the netherlands and many with caravans in tow . 
  you could spot the french ones easily with their yellow tinted headlights . 
  it 's a rare sight these days , probably because flying is cheaper than bringing the car over now . 
  we have loads of mountains . 
  not very high ones ( most are less than 1000m ) , but plenty of interesting and beautiful ones . 
  ireland is kind of like a basin , mostly flat in the center with hills and mountains around the edges . 
   anyway , what i mean is that people should not be limited because of ideological reasons . 
  agree 100 % with that , but practical reasons are why humans wear clothes in the first place . 
  there would be a problem with hygiene though . 
  and smells . 
  if everyone went around naked there 's gon na be some people rubbing their period blood , shit , piss and dick cheese all over seats . 
  good way to spread diseases . 
  it 's was a temperature warning , not a sunshine warning . 
  had some rain at times here in dublin too but the temperatures were as forecast . 
  it got to 28.6 c at the official phoenix park station today , with 26-28c in the other counties mentioned . 
  the forecast was spot on . 
  head not turned straight towards the camera , they would n't make the cut these days . 
  aoibheann n\u00ed bhroin is on the passport card , lauren on the regular one . 
  27 \u00b0 c here in dublin . 
  it 's not right . 
  i ca n't do this . 
  i think estonia will be ok with this . 
  yup it 's [ this image ] ( https://imgur.com/a/lf6y0 ) , one of the first results for cabbage on google image search . 
  i have no idea why cabbage is supposed to be offensive to ireland though \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af . 
  it 's probably a fake with no warranty that they bought from dailyexpress . 
  it 's tough alright , i can see `` get the girl '' too . 
  at least `` the '' as the middle word is the most legible , but could but something entirely different . 
  i 'm trying to decipher it , maybe `` all the grt \u2665 '' ? 
  after `` dear taoiseach '' it looks like '' ??? 
  looks like someone else wrote the date . 
  different handwriting and i have no fucking clue what his handwriting is saying except `` enda '' at the top . 
  as a borderline angry old person , i 'd be more likely to complain about `` the youth these days '' not doing stuff like this , ie . 
  being bubblewrapped and spending all day on their phones and games and netflix instead of being outside doing stupid shit like kids are supposed to do . 
  [ this is slightly relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou204dqbkwc ), 
  maybe it 's the most interested in something he 's ever been and ever will be .
