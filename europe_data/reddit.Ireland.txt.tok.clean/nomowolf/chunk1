as a cut man in europe ( due to my father being north american ) . 
  i 've never experienced anything anywhere near a negative reaction from it . 
  generally it would be the opposite , ranging from novel intrigue to not giving a hoot . 
  i hold zero grudge over it . 
  in saying that i would not have my children undergo what i consider a pretty unnecessary surgury . 
  i liked it . 
  all things considered it 's a pretty undesirable road . 
  `` it 's a designation not a name ... like 7 of 9 ! '', 
  i love it , bring on the pedantic semantics . 
  given the thread that 's pretty meta of you , big ups man you 're awesome . 
  or those damn oppressive basques , scribbling out the poor spanish names for towns in favour of their colonial euskadi . 
  sweeping statement but i 'm down with the principle . 
  is it ok to get a wee bit annoyed when i have to argue that the republic ( i mean it 's in the ** name ** and all ... ) is not part of the uk ? 
  i 'd actually never heard it as anything but derry air ( well except for danny boy ) . 
  til . 
  not in ireland , i do n't think most of us had even heard of that term 'til snatch was released . 
  tinkers was the most common phrase when i was young . 
  `` knackers '' is also a casual term for them though that 's highly pejorative . 
  just plain `` traveller '' is the common phrase if you do n't want to offend anyone , or `` member of the travelling community '' if it 's a newsreader . 
  indeed , the irish traveller is a population with separate roots ( from the main irish population ) dating back at least a millennium , which is equivalent to that of the roma gypsy though entirely separate . 
  there is nothing new-age about it , except perhaps their propensity now to travel europe and not just ireland . 
  describing them in any way related to hippies is so far off the mark i ca n't even begin to think how to address that apart from : ** just no ** . 
  certainly a complete cultural and almost an ethnic subdivision of irish people 's . 
  does n't sound like he had the capacity to understand the ( glaringly obvious ) subtleties of the situation he was raised in . 
  while you 're right there 's no need to apologise , it 's certainly okay to express a bit of shame and disappointment in them , as well as demonstrate not all people who share this identity act in such a manner . 
  i know i certainly feel that way with any hint of knob-ended republican nonsense . 
  you ca n't see it but he definitely would have been thrown to the side by the snow plough on the front rather than gone under . 
  he 's probably still alive . 
  i was n't trying to . 
  just throwing in the irish connection with wilde . 
  hey we welcomed your [ queen , ] ( http://sphotos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/231029_560139424314_530562_n.jpg ) and you welcomed [ ours ] ( http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/blog/images/2008/12/graham.jpg ) . 
  who 's irish . 
  but you 're right he was tried under british law at the time , by another irish man ( though diehard unionist ) edward carson . 
  northern ireland was not mentioned . 
  hangover makes ya narky like, 
  i understand , but i think there 's a fine line between confident and arrogant . 
  the persistent is not persistent in approach , but persistent in confidence , like ... unfazed by someone 's genuine disinterest . 
  also there is a difference between what women ( and men ) say they want , and what they actually go for ... otherwise all the funny romantic ( read : clingy and needy ) `` nice '' - guys who learn what to do from rom-coms would have girlfriends . 
  dutch men , in my experience , tend to be pretty cocky ( this is not a criticism ) , and it works well ( it must do ) for them with dutch women . 
  i 've heard , from non-dutch women , that the men are very ... `` practical '' and always `` go dutch '' ( splitting the bill ) ... but in fairness i 'd describe myself the same way . 
  i 've no time for someone who wants to sponge off me . 
  the girls ( again heard from non-dutch men ) are distant , shy and difficult to approach , not least because they tend to usually socialise in large women-only groups . 
  i 'm moving there soon , i 'll have a bit more observation then ... my tactic would be the same as here , persistently confident . 
  as someone who is emigrating to the netherlands in less than two weeks , and thought i knew it all ... 
  i have been humbled . 
  i had thought the term was in common use , but perhaps not . 
  [ secondary or high school ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secondary_education ) , coming after primary education , i.e. 
  approximately from age 12-18 . 
  `` third level '' then being being post secondary school , so university , technical diplomas/certificates etc. 
  while i 'd agree with you in general , second-level education is n't something britain is well known for . 
  in ireland at least , we are however somewhat in awe of your health care system and public transport system ( especially in london ) . 
  ucd dublin , has about 5000 more students . 
  ireland has barely an islamic population to speak of ( nor would it be accurate to describe the populous as anti-semitic ) ... but the largest university in the country recently had the palestinian [ flag at half mast ] ( http://sphotos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/422984_10151161775359094_803181864_n.jpg ) . 
  let me ask another question , which if any secularists were involved in it ? 
  3.5 years here and studying the language since day 1 , never get a chance to use it except when reading menu 's . 
  just as example comparisons , the point is to compare european cities , otherwise it would be just full of american cities . 
  yes san francisco is expensive . 
   i do n't imagine amsterdam is cheaper than san fransisco i know we tout amsterdam as expensive , same with london , but i do n't think we europeans really realise how ridiculously expensive it has gotten in places like san francisco ... for a comparison : https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/comparison/amsterdam/san-francisco ? 
  i mean i pay 30 % less tax than my dutch colleagues . 
  it 's difficult to compare to the us , i imagine i 'd pay less tax there then also get fewer services . 
  cost of living varies a lot in the us . 
  i 'm sure it could be quite low in places like new mexico ... but not where i 'd likely be working in , for example , california . 
  as someone in that field i dunno if the tradeoff is so good . 
  in the netherlands i get 40 holidays a year , a 40 hour week ( anything over is overtime and banked hours ) and really really good job security , also cost of living is much lower here than in technology areas in california . 
  and as a foreign skilled work i also pay 30 % less tax here . 
  plus in tech here and scandinavia you can get by fine with just english . 
  anytime i do the quick calculation , even for double pay , the pay per hour difference is n't that much while the quality of life in europe , health care and job security is much better . 
  i was unfortunately in the company of an old colleague when these two came together and caused him to repeat the `` n '' word ( in as innocent and affable way as he could . 
  imagine dylan moran or chris o'dowd having just discovered the word and you 'll know what i mean ) in a bar in the philidelphia full of about 60 % black americans . 
  we were lucky only to be manhandled out of the bar .

  he 's aged well , he would have been 13 at the time , and french !, 
  for those of us in work and can not watch , would you mind telling us why ? 
  it was lovely and sunny over ireland about 12 hours ago . 
  0 degrees out at 10am , at 12 i was relaxing in a swing chair in the back garden * with the dog on my lap , basking in the odd warmth without a jacket ... like sitting in front of a roaring fire . 
  * cos that 's what you do when you do n't have job , take the few joys you can , hopefully remedied soon , in another eu country ... come on phone call , bloody slow dutch administration . 
  you need to define `` good '' in terms of your personal preference . 
  personally i like espresso or cortado , i know where they do them well in dublin . 
  is dublin still on your list ? 
  if so here is my advice . 
  if you 're looking for just a big black ( american style ? ), 
  coffee with a lot of caffeine , a good quality alternative is to go to an italian style caf\u00e9 ( with italians working there ) dotted all around dublin and order a large americano with an extra shot of espresso in it . 
  the irish franchises like [ cafe sol ] ( http://www.cafesol.ie ) and [ insomnia ] ( http://insomnia.ie/ ) will give you stronger coffee ( super strength latt\u00e9 has 6 shots of espresso in it ... ) but imho they do n't taste quite as good . 
  if you 're really looking for the top of the range , [ 3fe ] ( http://3fe.com ) have placed ( 3rd ) in world barista championships and i can tell you it 's a whole new taste experience . 
  i hate these stereotypes . 
  i remember my italian and spanish ( phd science student ) friends not getting into nightclubs in denmark , whereas this ginger drunken ( and frankly less well behaved ) irish boy had no problem waddling in . 
  thankfully the internationalised scientific community ( though still mostly danes in this case ) was a little more accepting of their merits and genuine hard work . 
   i know / r/europe consists of only the best and brightest , but it also has a large contingent of british and irish people , whose average language skills would push those percentages even lower . 
  * sigh * an unfortunate truth . 
  i 'd be interested see a german 's reaction to this . 
  4.30 am was it really necessary to state this ? 
  i only need travel 60 miles ( in a common travel area ) to use your currency . 
  that is clearly not the point ( s ) he was making . 
   eu is our biggest trading partner . 
  saying `` we are ** in ** the eu '' possibly holds more weight . 
  it 's not so much that we did n't let them , they did n't want to . 
  would you bother conquering a place you called `` wintry '' . 
  sounds a bit like deck the halls,
