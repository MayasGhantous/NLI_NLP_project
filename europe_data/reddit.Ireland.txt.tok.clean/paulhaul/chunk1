... turning spain into a federal state . 
  something like how as in germany ? 
  how do the other parties view this possibility ? 
  ( seems like it could be a good solution ), 
  wow , some actual positive news , thanks greece, 
   ... on your [ arduous journey across the irish sea . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ivoehcz.jpg ) here 's a [ link to the full satire article ] ( http://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2016/06/24/thousands-of-british-refugees-make-dangerous-journey-across-the-irish-sea/ ) in case anyone was wondering . 
  i thought the borders between the baltics and russia closed after soviet era , so does that mean like , most migrants in estonia are old people ? 
  why is there so many foreign born people in estonia , and so few ( relatively ) in finland ? 
  i 'd have thought it 'd be the other way round ? 
   exactly . 
  faroe islands is ( are ? ), 
  exactly . 
  * the * faroe islands * are * at ... , 
  yes , scandinavia generally has colder winters and warmer summers than ireland , it 's a general trend though as you go further south in europe things get hotter , but also as you go further east ( away from the atlantic currents ) in europe things get more extreme so for example northern germany , denmark , baltics and russia which are at a similar latitude to ireland tend to have more extreme summer and extreme winters the further east you go along that line . 
   i thought that the netherlands took the cake when it came to darkest country in terms of sunlight hours . 
  no , i 'd guess iceland from looking at [ this map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sunshine_duration#/media/file:sunshine.png ), 
  interesting to know , have one for the the coldest temperatures ever recorded ? 
  true , though i did say just places not * all * places , i 've heard bergen on the west coast is somewhat similar to ireland, 
  nah , only some inland areas will see a high of 30 tomorrow , [ high for dublin is just 25 ] ( https://www.google.ie/#q=dublin+weather ), 
  yeah , the humidity is awful in winter too , unlike places like in scandinavia that have much dryer and colder winters with lots of fun snow , all we get is a horrible damp chill , the moisture in the air makes everything lose its heat so much quicker, 
  irish people also know nothing of cold winter . 
  ( we just do n't have big extremes because of the atlantic currents ) in summer apart from a few days it 's mostly just around 20 , tomorrow is probably gon na be the warmest day , the [ rest of the week is back below 20 ] ( https://www.google.ie/#q=ballina+weather ) in winter it usually does n't fall below zero degrees , so we do n't get much snow , still just rain , but freezing cold rain instead of the quite cold rain we get in summer . 
  for irish people : over 25 degrees = `` too warm '' , under 5 degrees = `` too cold '', 
  i do n't understand though , why exactly are they all so drawn to erdogan , especially when the ones that live abroad like in germany , have access to a less biased press , how can they not see what he 's doing with the centralisation of control into his office , against freedom of the press/expression etc. . . ? 
  is it a nationalistic thing , like are you seen as anti-turkish if you do n't support erdogan ? 
  that bright red and white contrast is just offensive to the eyes , the blue and grey of the bundestag is much nicer, 
  another thing , krugman also seems to imply , is that this figure has been fiddled to get it so high by the government for political reasons , but this 26 % figure is from the cso ( central statistics office ) , not the department of finance , which is apolitical and not directly directed by the government ( we 're not china ) . 
  ( whether gdp is actually a good measure , or not , is a different debate . ), 
  ** rolls eyes **, 
  and you think , what , britain should feel offended on behalf of nigel farage ? 
  it was n't even that harsh , he had it coming imo, 
   why are you still here ? 
  that was his response to nigel farage in eu parliament , not brexit in general , farage has said far worse to him many times, 
  but a different kind of complexity , a predictable complexity , the tracks are all the same and do n't move in hard to predict ways , the trains can only move along those tracks , on the other hand , the turbulence that a plane moves through is highly variable and unpredictable , therefore it 's harder to program a program to manage this ( this would require some sort of advanced ai ) , checking which trains are on which track at which time would be much easier to program, 
  driving a plane is a bit more complex than checking which trains are on which track , so i do n't think this is a great analogy, 
  is there no way to automate the system , so it would n't be so subject to human error ? 
  interesting that spain and greece , with similarly high unemployment rates , have such different views here , can anyone explain this ? 
  interesting though , according to [ cso statistics for april 2016 ( latest available on the site ) ] ( http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/gei/goodsexportsandimportsapril2016/ ) , uk ( including ni ) is now a lower value of exports than belgium , this is only the first half of year but when compared with same part of last year : jan16-apr16 : 4893m = belgium , 4064m = gb , 532m = ni , therefore 4595m = uk compare with jan15-apr15 : 4445m = belgium , 4192m = gb , 566m = ni , therefore 4758m = uk, 
  i think most people think , if they 're going to topple him though , they should just get on with it , instead of dragging it out , people are already bored of hearing of fg 's `` inner turmoil '' . 
  to be honest it 's bit surprising enda 's even lasted this long , after losing over 10 % in the election in feb. 
  and btw :  i 'm not sure what the exact english translation is , but pis is what we call `` a leader 's party '' ( partia wodzowska ) , i think the term [ `` personality cult '' ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/personality-cult ) would be the most common english idiom used in this case . 
   also , not sure about turkey but i 'm pretty certain russia is officially a presidential republic just like usa . 
  turkey is definitely supposed to be a parliamentary system officially , though erdogan wants to change it to a presidential system . 
  also just checked , and russia has actually has a semi-presidential system ( officially ) , so i guess i 'm half-right there , though i 'm not really sure how a semi-presidential is supposed to work normally , i know france has one , but i 've no idea how that works . 
  ireland : it 's not looking good for [ enda kenny , who may soon may be taken down in a leadership contest ] ( http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/lameduck-kenny-gone-by-the-spring-34866556.html ) ( if he does n't just resign ) , minister [ leo varadkar is seen as the front runner ] ( http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/varadkar-steals-march-on-rivals-as-contest-to-succeed-kenny-begins-34869167.html ) , if he wins he 'd become ireland 's first openly gay head of government . 
  edit : in other the news , that 's just come out , apparently the [ economy grew by 26.3 % in last year ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/economy-grows-by-26-3-in-2015-says-cso-1.2719047 ), 
  how neutral is the press , is it biased in the way a lot of the uk press is . 
  or biased like russia/saudi arabia/china kind of bias , for example ? 
  how is pis run , is it a bit of a personality cult , for example , how often would you see mps question their leader or take a different view ? 
  also how neutral is the president , is it like ireland where they are mostly neutral and do n't have influence over the parliament or try to influence the parliament , for example , irish presidents do n't usually comment on individual laws though do sometimes give opinions on a broad issue ( like refugees ) , or on the other hand is it more like russia and turkey where officially it 's a parliamentary system , but in reality it 's a big personality cult and they like they basically control the parliament and nothing happens without their approval ? 
  so how bad exactly is it in poland , is it as bad as hungary or turkey ? 
   i 'm surprised she did n't say that immigrants caused global warming . 
  would be an absurd thing to say , as obviously the chinese made it up . 
  was just about to comment that . 
  then i remembered how there 's a like starbucks and/or insomia on like literally every street corner in dublin . 
  it all makes sense now . 
  that would be hilarious , just imagine angela merkel addressing theresa may in an irish accent and calling it `` european english '' , so many brits would be triggered, 
  god , this meme just does n't die, 
  [ never forget ] ( http://giphy.com/gifs/president-ireland-prime-minister-9tvptfd1okf8s ), 
  interesting theory , unfortunately it would require the left to unite themselves , so i would n't bet on it, 
  no , the uk government have chosen this , if they really wanted to keep an open border with ireland , they should have made this the priority in brexit negotiations , instead they have made it perfectly clear that ending free movement of people and leaving the single market are their higher priorities . 
  polls have never really been wrong , what 's wrong is how pundits have been interpreting them . 
  us election : hillary won popular vote , pundits underestimated trumps electoral college advantage , and also counted on turnout of certain demographics to benefit hillary more . 
  brexit : there was pretty much never a remain lead outside of the margin of error , and plenty of polls putting leave ahead ( also within margin of error ) . 
  again pundits saw only what they wanted to see . 
  65-35 is a big lead , even if it 's wrong by 10 points in le pen 's favour , she 'd still be losing . 
  in comparison brexit polls were almost always within the margin of error so that either side could win . 
  even republic of telly was shit towards the end though , i was thinking youtube as well , rubber bandits would be one choice , i think foil arms and hog would work well too . 
  i dread the thought of one of our late night shows doing this though . 
  they are all so awful , so cringe , truly , the worst . 
  yeah , that 's what i meant , the `` bundesl\u00e4nder '' , i suppose it 's kinda hard to translate that into english , and still be clear that does n't mean * sovereign * states ( ie . 
  countries ) . 
  i thought people would understand what i meant from the context that germany is a federal republic so is made up of states like america, 
  the article breaks it down into : 9.1 given to the state governments . 
  7.1 for combating causes for fleeing within the affected countries , like humanitarian aid etc. 
  ( tripled from last year ) . 
  2.1 for integration services in germany , presumably like language courses or something . 
  1.7 in social welfare given to refugees/asylum seekers . 
  1.4 in admin costs related to refugees/asylum seekers . 
  ( also german is not my native language , so any germans feel free to correct me if i 've mistranslated something here . ), 
  yes , especially dublin , south dublin even more so , elsewhere is still more expensive though , because our vat is quite high too , like if you look up the price of an iphone on the apple website then change the / ie / in the address to / de / or whatever , it 's all more expensive here ;(, 
  you said , english does n't apply to this rule , which i 've shown it does , just because there are also schwa vowels does n't mean this rule does n't apply , there are schwas in german too , eg . 
  no , < - y  endings are always pronounced as a short / i / , here 's another example english pronunciation of [ `` psychology '' / sa\u026a\u02c8k\u0251l\u0259d\u0292i / ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/psychology ) , you can see the unstressed < o  becomes a schwa but the < y  is reduced only in length . 
  edit : i checked whether this applies to vowels other than the < - y  ending , and yeah it does , here 's other examples when unstressed vowels do n't reduce to schwa : * unite / ju\u02c8na\u026at / * okay / \u02cco\u028a\u02c8ke\u026a / * issue / \u02c8\u026a\u0283u / or / \u02c8\u026a\u0283ju / * influence / \u02c8\u026an.flu.\u0259ns / * pronunciation / pr\u0259\u02ccn\u028cnsi\u02c8e\u026a\u0283\u0259n / * also many compound words such as lifelong / \u02c8la\u026afl\u0251\u014b / , bypass / ` baip\u00e6s / , or runoff / ` r\u028cn\u0254f /, 
  it seems they did include them for french though , so kinda strange that they left them out for polish, 
   count long and short vowels separately ( see : german , hungarian , finnish ) yeah , they 're kinda inconsistent here , also in germanic languages `` long vowels '' generally have different vowel qualities so they 're actually just different vowels ( eg . 
  / \u026a / vs / i\u02d0 / , and in some unstressed syllables the only difference is quality not length , eg . 
  in the english bitterly / ` b\u026at\u0259rli / or german `` psychologie '' / \u02ccpsy\u02d0\u00e7olo\u02c8\u0261i\u02d0 / ) ) . 
  in finnish and japanese the only difference is length ( eg . 
  / i / vs / i\u02d0 / ), 
  yeah , i know , i was just commenting on the op 's chosen english translation . 
  i think perhaps a better translation of the second headline would just read `` do n't be afraid ! '', 
  saying `` fear not ! '', 
  in english has a more sarcastic connotation . 
  as for the first headline , even though of course angst generally means fear or anxiety , a more fitting translation in this context might just be `` terror ! '', 
  also some surprisingly [ poorly researched articles from ard ] ( http://www.tagesschau.de/inland/ehe-fuer-alle-121.html ) , i suppose they did n't have much time to put it together lol . 
  [ this video ] ( http://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/video/video-303143~player_branded-true.html ) showing the map of [ full adoption rights for same sex couples ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_adoption ) is definitely wrong , at least for ireland , [ amendments providing full adoption rights ] ( https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/children-and-family-relationships-bill-passes-in-seanad-1.2159352 ) for same sex couples in the [ adoption legislation ] ( http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/isbc/2010_21.html ) were actually passed preliminary by our parliament in 2015 before the constitutional referendum on marriage so it would be an less of an issue during the referendum on marriage rights for same-sex couples . 
  thanks , was actually considering editing in another line saying about fascism/authoritarianism thing saying , using that term to refer to fg is an insult to all journalists and academics locked up in turkish prison right at this minute , and all those who died at the hands of the nazi regime , but i think i 've hammered my point in well enough already . 
  like you say shame about labour , probably the worst tragedy of the last election , a centre-left party willing to make hard decisions , went into the last election with a 150 + pg manifesto , fully fleshed out and costed , and the aaa-pbp went in with two doubled sided a4 pages , vague uncosted promises based on ending austerity and the evil capitalist `` system '' and were barely challenged for it and they 're on rte all the time .
