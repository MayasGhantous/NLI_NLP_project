  surely nobody would stoop to something as petty as that . 
  looks like you did n't get your free copy of : * a handy guide to ukrainian stereotypes on / r/europe . 
  * ** eastern ukranians : ** putinbots with a penchant for shooting down civilian airlines . 
  * not real ukranians * . 
  ** western ukranians : ** victims . 
  even when they 're shelling civilians , making use of neo-nazi volunteer battalions and shooting unarmed civilians in mariupol . 
  there 's no need for nuance . 
  just remember that the former are evil incarnate , and the latter are righteous freedom-loving pro-eu friends . 
  keep this in mind and you ca n't go wrong . 
   magnificently inaccurate , at least . 
  the irony is almost too much to bear . 
   no , it 's pretty much the other way round . 
  the greek banks were ok until the writedown of greek public debt held by private lenders . 
  no , it 's not . 
  you 've literally just described how private institutions undermined themselves as a result of decisions that * they * made to hold greek government bonds ( ggbs ) -- and subsequently write-off a portion of this debt through various mechanisms which we do n't need to go into here . 
   greek banks did n't collapse the greek economy or the greek state - the greek state benefited from collapsing banks . 
  the writedown of private sector debt in 2012 was worth $ 100bn to greece , even after recapitalising the greek banks . 
  i ca n't even fathom the mental gymnastics that were required in order to write that . 
  the greek state did not benefit in any manner from the near-collapse of the greek banking sector . 
  acknowledging that $ 100bn of private debt was written-off in 2012 is neither here nor there , and it certainly does n't support your preceding point . 
  in 2010 , the greeks went cap-in-hand to the eu , looking to get other eu countries to effectively act as guarantors for issuing more ggbs when they realised that they could n't make the $ 60bn in bond payments that were due over the coming year -- * bond payments which existed as a result of the preceding bailout of the greek banking sector . 
  * the greeks were given three * neins * by merkel in her now famous speech : the greeks were told no to a bail-out ( which they subsequently received in the form of efsf funding ) , no to interest rate relief and no to any form of default , as the latter would result in some $ 75bn and $ 53bn of loans to french and german banks respectively being defaulted on . 
  should the latter have happened , it would have created a banking crisis in both countries , and sure we could n't have that . 
  so how exactly did the greek state benefit from the collapse of the greek banks ? 
  did they benefit when they turned a banking crisis into a sovereign-debt crisis ? 
  no , they did n't . 
  did they benefit when they could n't make payments on their unsustainable debt and went to the eu for help -- help which amounted to kicking the can down the road by taking on * more * debt to fund their already unsustainable debt ? 
  no , they did n't . 
  so , who benefited ? 
  the french and german banks benefited . 
  they managed to avoid collapsing under the weight of their own poor decisions as the dodgy greek banking system was momentarily secured , thus buying them time to divest themselves of their shoddy periphery loans -- which they did . 
  the german politicians benefited , as it prevented a banking crisis in their own country and gave them a convenient scapegoat by framing a european crisis as greek profligacy . 
  no , the greek government did not benefit in any manner whatsoever from the collapse of the greek banking sector . 
   saying something is a private loan does not make it not public responsibility when it was borrowed as public debt . 
  you 're basically saying that borrowers have no real responsibility to repay debt - it 's the fault of the lender , or just tough shit for the lender . 
  that 's not what i 'm saying , although i can understand how you might wish to disingenuously portray it in such a way . 
  i 've never said , and have no intention of claiming that debtors have no responsibility in a debtor-creditor agreement . 
  the fact remains that the ultimate responsibility rests on the lender ; this is why actuarial science is such a well paid profession . 
  if you lend money , you bear the risks associated with the loan in question ; hence why interest rates charged are proportional to the perceived risk of lending to the debtor . 
  this is n't some radical concept . 
  banks account for this with bad loan provisions on their balance sheets . 
  we do n't live in 16th century venice , where a creditor is given serious consideration in his entitlement to take a pound of flesh when a debtor 's position becomes unsustainable . 
  you , like many others in this thread are applying some crass moralistic-lens on debt which simply is n't adhered to by * anybody * except politicians , shoddy journalists and unfortunately an increasingly large number of people who really have no business passing comment on matters they do n't understand . 
  no serious economist in the imf is thinking ` ohh , greece has a * responsibility * to pay back all of its debt ' -- they 'll be thinking ` shit , we judged that incorrectly . 
  what sort of deal can we strike to realistically recoup as much of our investment as possible ? ' . 
   and in this case , the borrower was lying about its true indebtedness - with all the resources at the disposal of the state to make the lie stick ... but part of the reason they were is because greece was lying to them . 
  i agree that a combination of corruption and ` creative accounting practices ' enabled with the aid of a special type of scum from goldman sachs , led to ggb risk being made as opaque as possible . 
  on the other hand , greece is n't the only culprit for deliberately packaging shit debt and passing it off as aaa-rated . 
  the ultimate responsibility rests with the person loaning the money to assess the risk correctly . 
   it was their choice to do so , in order to keep having banks . 
  if you honestly believe this , i have no idea what to say . 
  in a hypothetical european union that is democratic in more than just token symbolism , the greeks would have been able to deliberate with their `` partners '' to find a solution to the crisis that actually makes sense . 
  instead , they were given the effective ultimatum of bailout or total anarchy . 
  this is not a choice ; claiming that it is is analogous to claiming that slaves have a choice to not to be slaves , all they have to do is kill themselves . 
   in fact , greek private lenders were required by law to hold greek government bonds . 
  i would appreciate it if you could provide a source for this , as i admit that i 've never heard of this law . 
  i 'd also appreciate it if you could prove that the required amounts are substantial enough to merit mentioning this law . 
  if the amount is n't substantial -- you 're simply mentioning a technicality which has little relevance to the original point . 
  [ in 2010 nbg held $ 3.1 bn of ggbs on its balance sheet whilst alpha bank and postbank held $ 1.1 bn and $ 343m respectively ] ( http://www.bankofgreece.gr/bogekdoseis/report_on_the_recapitalisation_and_restructuring.pdf ) . 
  given the sheer discrepancy in amounts of ggbs on the balance sheets of the seven largest banks in greece during the height of the crisis , you 'll forgive me if i 'm somewhat dubious about how your law is of any relevance to the discussion -- other than as a cheap ` gotcha on a technicality ' . 
  of course , i 'm happy to stand corrected . 
   this is not socialisation of private debt , this is europeanisation of greek public debt . 
  you concentrate on who loaned the money , as if the lender being private made the debt somehow a purely private problem it 's clearly not a purely private problem -- my point is that * it should be a purely private problem * . 
  if you 're an advocate of capitalism , it 's not a shocking statement to argue that that 's how it 's * supposed * to work . 
   others look at who benefited from the spending the money . 
  the latter is the normal way of determining responsibility . 
  it 's really not . 
  as i said before , you 're viewing debt through a moralistic lens . 
  debt is n't about ` responsibility ' , it 's about risk . 
  banks , traders , hell * anybody who understands finance in any manner * does n't give a flying fuck about responsibility -- all they care about is minimising risk . 
  risk is part and parcel of lending -- except in this case , when you can call on the taxpayer to pick up the pieces when your sheer incompetency leads to the collapse of your institution . 
   that the kind of narrative you 've convinced yourself of is that used in anti-jewish pogroms through european history - this really does attest to the quality of your character . 
  when you reach a point of such complete moral bankruptcy that you resort to drawing parallels between a criticism of the greek debt crisis and anti-semitism -- you 're so far up your own arse in your own little fairytale world that i 'm surprised you can even find the keyboard . 
  reply or do n't - i really could n't care less at this stage . 
  i 'm frankly sick of responding to people like you over the past two days . 
  somehow i missed your comment earlier among the influx of poorly written nonsense i received in my inbox . 
   ah , come on , not this rubbish again . 
  the money has `` gone to private banks '' because that 's who the greek government borrowed it from yes , this `` rubbish '' again . 
  maybe you could never grasp the concept of responsible lending practices , so let me teach you how loans work . 
  it 's not a case of `` i , as a ** private ** lender loan you a ** public institution ** $ 5bn , you pay me interest in return when times are good - and when my inability to discern risk leads to reckless lending practices which collapse the national economy , you simply get the taxpayer to step in and reimburse ** my ** losses and fund my ability to maintain an acceptable capital-adequacy ratio '' . 
  that 's what happened . 
  the fact that much of the debt which led to the necessary recapitalisation of the greek banks was greek government bonds ( ggbs ) does n't undermine the fact that these were private loans - the capital used to * fund greek government expenditure was private capital * . 
  a risk was taken in lending , said risk was poorly assessed . 
  when you make a bad loan , you lose money - end of story . 
   it 's not `` private debt socialised '' , it 's greek public debt in the first place . 
  yes , it is . 
  you 're unable to differentiate between two completely seperate concepts , namely ggbs and the process of recapitalisation . 
  you should familiarise yourself with property rights before you return to this exchange . 
  the ggbs which made up significant portions of the balance sheets of greek banks were public debt - that much you seem to grasp . 
  the point that you seem to be utterly incapable of understanding is that when said debts ( which are public debt , but private loans ) decrease in asset value , * it is not the responisibility of the greek state to step in and recapitalise these private institutions , * ** who , under no threat of coercion , made a choice to lend money to the greek government ** - * using loans paid for by the troika , guaranteed by the taxpayer . 
  * this is a socialisation of private debt . 
  the greeks are paying for the losses of private creditors - the fact that the government is the debtor in this relationship is neither here nor there . 
  had the greek banks never lent the money in the first place , this debacle would simply not have happened . 
  fair enough - my knowledge of state surpluses in the us is less than perfect . 
   as i 'm sure you can see , i 've completely avoided any form of marxist analysis in this thread - if / r/europe loses its shit over moderate keynesian suggestions to * save and bolster * european capitalism , you can imagine the sheer hilarity that would ensue if i suggested the abolition of the capitalist mode of production . 
  i agree with you that if the eu is going to thrive as a bloc of capitalist states , it needs to move towards federalisation with a single currency ( with a surplus recycling mechanism ) and a common military . 
  the small nation state is obsolete in the 21st century . 
  many political scientists view the eu as an incipient federation for the purpose of analysis anyway - lijphart immediately comes to mind as one . 
  as a marxist , i 'm very much in favour of the federalisation of europe - just not under the auspices of a bigger eu . 
  in that respect , i would actually like to see the eu collapse as a result of its own internal contradictions ; greek and british exits would be key to undermining the legitimacy and power of the eu on the global stage .
