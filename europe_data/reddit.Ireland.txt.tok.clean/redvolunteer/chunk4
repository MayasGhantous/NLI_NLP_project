  for many of us , a divided europe brings hope for change ; you can see how the biggest swings to the left have been in the periphery , where the reality of what the eu stands for has become painfully apparent . 
  as for a marxist analysis ? 
  it remains consistent throughout the decades . 
  transfer * all economic forces into the hands of democratically elected representatives and organise production on the basis of [ use-value ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/use_value ) , not [ exchange-value ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exchange_value ) . 
  * in the simplest sense , democratise the economy . 
  how this is done is a different matter . 
  some advocate market policies , i am in favour of central planning - but not the the sense of beureaucratic planning of the soviet union . 
  a number of excellent academic papers have been written about using computers to effectively plan production - if you want an introduction to the concept , i recommend reading about [ project cybersyn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/project_cybersyn ) to get a feel for what i 'm talking about . 
  hit me up if you fancy some heavier reading material . 
   but a gift nonetheless look , if you insist on glibly bastardising economic policy to the point of describing things a ` gifts ' , there 's nothing more that i can contribute to help you understand . 
   other struggling european economies ( spain , portugal , ireland ) will scream unfair and want a similar package , something the eurozone can ill afford . 
  of course they will , and so they should . 
  the existing economic policies are absurd and even the imf predicts that they will not resolve the greek debt crisis . 
  i 'm offering potential solutions , acknowledging that * even the imf acknowledges that the current plan is bullshit * and your retort is * but we ca n't afford to give the greeks gifts * - which in itself belies your complete lack of understanding about macroeconomic policies . 
  of course we can afford it , what is lacking is the political will to undertake serious structural reform at both ez and eu levels . 
   that 's really oversimplifying . 
  germany was an economic and industrial powerhouse prior to the war , setback only due to the destruction of the war . 
  the problem is n't structural but rather transient . 
  that 's a fantastic feat of mental gymnastics you 've just managed to pull . 
  german , a country whose industry was physically leveled to the ground did n't have a * structural problem * ? 
  the complete re-industrialisation of a war-torn country was just a `` transient '' problem . 
  you 're actually unbelievable - i 'm physically laughing . 
   greece , on the other hand ( along with many struggling european countries ) , has shown no sign of similar vitality for the past century or two , and i find that the problems are ingrained and structural ( e.g. 
  political corruption , tax avoidance ) that a one-time injection of money simply ca n't solve . 
  now who 's over-simplifying ? 
  once again , and i 'm genuinely getting tired of saying this , the underlying issue is the socialisation of bad loans . 
  yes , greece has issues - but it 's disingenuous to pretend that pensions and tax collection wrapped up in cultural-reductionist argument are the underlying issues behind the current crisis . 
  again , you stoop to the level of complete intellectual dishonesty by misrepresenting industrial development policies as a ` one-time injection of money ' . 
  i 'm really getting sick of your shit - if you ca n't at least make relevant points , just do n't bother responding . 
  i could n't think any less of you at this point anyway . 
   what i did claim is that regardless of what greece chooses now , they will have to undergo austerity since no one lends to a bankrupt state this is a bold claim to make . 
  at a * very * superficial level , you 're right . 
  greece will have tremendous difficulty borrowing money immediately after default - nobody disputes that . 
  on the other hand , if greece defaults , devaules their currency and starts afresh - they will have the opportunity to reset asset prices to their real values and ultimately be in a favourable position to pursue export-led growth policies , which in turn attracts investment , which in turn strengthens the economy , which in turn provides a sustainable economic model which enables the government to raise money on international markets etc. 
  ** even if this takes ten years , the greeks would be better off pursuing this road than continuing with austerity policies that the imf admit will still leave them in a position of unsustainable debt by 2030 . 
  ** but the point that i 'm making is that * this is n't the only choice . 
  * `` austerity or fuck off '' is a false dichotomy . 
  reform of both the ez and eu in order to promote a balanced development policy across europe is not a radical proposal - i , and many others argue that it 's a modest and * necessary * proposal if the social-democratic consensus in europe is to prevail . 
  unfortunately , as you say - the majority of voters in * some * countries are adverse to reforming the ez and eu through sheer ignorance of what their demands for austerity entail for europe as a whole . 
   the irony here is that you 're doing exactly what you 're accusing me of . 
  how quaint . 
  if you address me in a condescending tone then i address you in an equally condescending tone , that 's not a form of irony . 
  the only situation that my comment might be construed as ironic is if i explicitly condemned the use of condescension and then proceeded to make use of it - which is not the case . 
  how do people like you exist after coming through 12 + years of education ? 
   it is intellectually dishonest for you to suggest otherwise   translates to : no u. 
   all you have addressed in the rest of your comment is how a gift of money will help greece no , i explicitly discuss the need for a unified , structured industrialisation and development programme , not making a `` gift '' of money to greece . 
  but , hey . 
  if you 're incapable of comprehending something as basic as irony , i 'm hardly surprised that you 've had difficulty understanding that point . 
   different situation . 
  no shit . 
  do you specialise in missing the point , or is it just a natural talent that you were born with ? 
  the policy in germany worked - it was smart economic policy that enabled a * completely crippled economy * to become the economic powerhouse of europe . 
  the policy in greece is n't working - it 's shit-tier economics that , even the [ troika admits in its leaked documents , will leave greece with unsustainable levels of debt by 2030 . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-troika-analysis-says-significant-concessions-still-needed ) it 's clear that the political will is n't there , such facile tangential observations do n't undermine the point . 
   blah blah the european leaders and their army of economists should just listen to this armchair faux economist and do what i say and things will be fixed , because they 're clearly idiots who did n't think of this most obvious solution . 
  `` i 'm a disingenuous fool who is deliberately trying to pass off a series of economic observations supported by ** the quoted views of a nobel laurate in economics ** as the pontifications of an armchair economist . 
  my level of smug is currently 420/8 m8s . '', 
   i love being condescending it does give me some degree pleasure when i find somebody as antagonistic and hopeless as you to wail on . 
  you brought this on yourself - i simply respond to people the way they respond to me . 
  do n't start being a whiney little prick about it . 
  you 're missing the point . 
  the * overwhelming majority * greece 's debt was used to fund the recapitalisation of the greek banking system - to socialise the losses of private-sector lenders . 
  this is a different concept from running a budget deficit and borrowing to fund said deficit . 
  the point of bringing up odious debt was to highlight this relationship . 
  running a budget deficit is n't the underlying problem , or necessarily a bad thing ; america has been doing it for the majority of years since 1970 . 
  the only people who claim that ` balancing the books ' constitutes good economic practice are austrian school hacks , eu politicians and people who do n't know the slightest thing about macroeconomics ( of which there is a huge overlap between the last two populations ) . 
  thanks pal . 
  i always find it funny how people on both the left and the right manage to converge on the sheer idiocy of the ez and eu economic policy , even if our proposals for what should replace it are vastly different . 
  on the other hand , think of all the quasi-moral righteousness you 're missing out on !, 
  would n't it be nice to feel an air of superiority about matters you clearly do n't understand ? 
  lazy alaskan scum , leeching from the industrious texans . 
  yes , i am arguing for a default . 
  that 's been the very basis of my argument - had greece defaulted in ' 08 , ** your ** shitty banking system would have collapsed and ** your ** country would be in a similar position to greece . 
  now that your banks have divested themselves of much of the bad periphery debt , your country is no longer as exposed to a greek default as it was . 
  this has never been a greek problem , it has always been a * european problem * . 
  your government has cynically played a game wherein the socialisation of debts that protected the * entire * ez financial sector , and thus the euro , has been passed down to the average greek . 
  this is something that you , and the majority of others in this thread seem incapable of comprending , lest it undermine your simplistic notion of ungrateful greeks with their hands out chanting ` gib money pls deutschland - moar pensions ' . 
   the bailout programs were the recapitalization . 
  that 's the point . 
  you ca n't have one without the other . 
  i ca n't tell if you 're just being obstinate in an attempt to save face . 
  i realise that english probably is n't your first language , so please go back and read what i wrote again . 
  when you 've done that , then look at what you just wrote with a critical eye . 
  of course the bailout programs were concerned with the recapitalisation of the banking system , that 's * explicitly * what i 've been saying . 
  please do n't respond until you 're capable of comprehending the point that was initially made - a point that * nobody else * in this thread has had a problem comprehending . 
   that would have been freely available while the banking sector was on fire and the economy everywhere would have suffered , and that no country would have invested into itself to represent the interests of its own people ( that would have been under severe pressure due to the previously mentioned further escalated economic crisis ) while greeks , spanish , portuguese etc. 
  were starving on their respective streets . 
  well at least we agree on one thing , that the eu is so poorly structured that rather than enabling time for eu governments to deliberate over the best course of action ( as one would expect in a ` democratic ' union ) , the greeks , irish spanish etc. 
  were forced into making snap decisions under the coercive threat of having their populations starving on the streets . 
   the part where you 're burning down the economy for something that already exists and does not stop investment banks from existing and causing trouble . 
  no , the point is that the moral argument for debt rests on the fact that the creditor takes a risk by lending money and suffers an opportunity cost , as a result of which they are entitled to charge interest for use of their capital . 
  the point is not that one can make shit loans , profit from them when everything is fine and then have the taxpayer step in to fund your terrible lending practices when everything falls apart . 
  the point is that functioning banks * did n't exist * . 
  a functioning bank should have been created and the others should have been left to fail . 
  of course , that would have affected the german banking system - so we could n't have that . 
   no , here i assume that you 're trying to innovate and actually attempt to solve long standing issues instead of basically going back to he way it was before but doing more damage to the european economy and citizens in the process because `` muh banks '' . 
  this paragraph makes no sense in the context of the discussion . 
  please rephrase what you 're trying to say if you want me to address it . 
   no , but the only way to make the system no , you quite literally equate the existence of a state bank with communism . 
  you clearly had , and have no intention of conducting this exchange in good faith by shamelessly denying this fact - this is just an egotistical pissing match for you .
