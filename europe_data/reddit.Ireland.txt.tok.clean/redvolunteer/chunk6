  where , in this , was greece in any way spoiled ? 
  under the terms of odious debt , the government arguably did n't have the right to do what they did . 
  further , they did n't have a moral obligation to do anything . 
  many on both the left and right would argue that they had a moral obligation to let the banks fail , and from their ashes , create a new banking system and/or a state bank . 
   is this supposed to be an objective definition ? 
  adorable . 
  somebody who thinks that objectivity exists . 
  no , it 's not ` objective ' , it 's a serious of indisputable observations . 
   the reason the `` household budget '' view is appealing is because it 's common sense . 
  giving it a name does nothing to explain why it is wrong . 
  the reason the `` world is flat '' view is appealing is because it 's common sense . 
  the world is n't flat and national economies are n't households - claiming either only tells everybody that you do n't know anything about the subject you 're opining on . 
   oh nooo , not the metaphor of the orphan who gets shot in the head !, 
  i 'm glad to see you found something in the comment that you could write about at length . 
  your sarcastic abilities far outstretch your abilities for economic analysis - i 'd stick to that in the future if i were you . 
  ah , look . 
  another condescending little star who assumes that everybody who does n't agree with them is an idiot . 
  how cute . 
   and may i ask who will loan the government money ? 
  if you took two minutes to understand the composition of greek debt in the context of my point , you would n't pose a question like that . 
  # [ composition of greek debt ] ( http://www.bloombergbriefs.com/content/uploads/sites/2/2015/02/wheregreececanfindit.pdf ) institution | $ bn | % of total -- | -- | -- european financial stability facility | 141 | 44.9 greek loan facility : mostly ez government loans | 53 | 16.8 private investors | 55 | 17.5 ecb | 27 | 8.6 imf | 24 | 7.7 other | 14 | 4.6 ** total greek debt ** | ** 315 ** | ** 100 ** greek debt not funded by private investors | 260 | 82.5 had the majority of that $ 260bn been used to finance a state bank and industrial development policies instead of socialising the debts of private institutions , you would n't be asking irrelevant questions about whether or not private investors would be willing to buy greek government bonds . 
   austerity = government ca n't afford to spend that much . 
  no , friend . 
  it might suit your agenda to portray things this way , but it 's intellectually dishonest and downright wrong to do so . 
  when the allies turned germany into a wasteland after ww2 , what did the young federal republic do ? 
  they certainly could n't afford to spend billions on rapid re-industrialisation projects , and yet they did so . 
  they paid for the loans which enabled this through a series of agreeements which ensured repayments only when they experienced * export surpluses * . 
  the us , uk and france ( who were the creditors ) , did n't drip-feed their banking system money and insist on a series of punitive , disastrous economic policies as their economy further degenerated to the point of being utterly crippled - all on the basis of some hack populist ideology which equates national economies to matters of personal thrift . 
   greece , ireland and all the other countries do n't understand that austerity is n't a bad word , it is n't an unnatural construct . . blah blah blah ` my understanding of macroeconomics amounts to personal-finance analogies ' okay mate . 
  i 'm not even going to bother . 
  even the imf admits in its recently [ leaked documents ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-troika-analysis-says-significant-concessions-still-needed ) that the austerity policies , even if they 're explicitly followed , will still leave greece with an unsustainable level of debt by 2030 . 
  of course , throw disingenuous , simple analogies in the pot with more than a hint of bigotry and you have a message for the masses which is much more powerful than meaningful analysis . 
  just look at the comments and allocation of upvotes in this thread . 
  i addressed the point quite clearly , but for the sake of argument i 'll elaborate further . 
  you 're operating under the assumption that the debt ( i mention this as the interest payments make up the most significant portion of the deficit problem ) * should * be financed . 
  let me introduce you to the term odious debt :  [ in international law , odious debt , also known as illegitimate debt , is a legal theory that holds that ** the national debt incurred by a regime for purposes that do not serve the best interests of the nation , should not be enforceable . 
  ** such debts are , thus , considered by this doctrine to be personal debts of the regime that incurred them and not debts of the state . 
  in some respects , the concept is analogous to the invalidity of contracts signed under coercion . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/odious_debt ) socialising private debt does not serve the best interests of greece , or any european nation . 
  it serves the interests of private investors on wall st. , frankfurt , paris and the city of london . 
  instead of imposing austerity on greece , ireland , spain etc. 
  a much better option would have been to allow the banks to fail and use the trillions already spent on recapitalising these failed institutions to create a series of state banks with the explicit goal of funding infrastructure development and industrial projects . 
  of course , that would require a common , balanced industrial development plan for the eu with surplus recycling mechanisms . 
  we ca n't have that though , best just to tell all the greeks with an air of moral superiority that they 're lazy ; that they need to tighten their belts and pull themselves up by their bootstraps like the industrious germans . 
    the only things that stays constant is that they 're victims and they do n't want to pay their debt . 
  why should they ? 
  i quote from a recent article by nobel laurate in economics joseph stiglitz :  [ we should be clear : almost none of the huge amount of money loaned to greece has actually gone there . 
  it has gone to pay out private-sector creditors -- including german and french banks . 
  greece has gotten but a pittance , but it has paid a high price to preserve these countries ' banking systems . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/29/joseph-stiglitz-how-i-would-vote-in-the-greek-referendum ) it 's not * their * debt , it 's private debt that was socialised to protect a structurally unsound monetary union . 
  the greeks , as well as the irish and other periphery nations that experienced banking crises , received loans from the central european nations to prop up their banking systems - not because it was a generous/right thing to do - but because german ( mostly ) banks held huge amounts of periphery debt on their balance sheets :  [ the application of regulatory rules allowed german banks to accumulate effectively unlimited international assets in relation to the capital they held if those assets were triple-a rated . 
  as a consequence the balance sheets of german banks were full not only of sub-prime mortgage-backed securities , but also sovereign and bank bonds issued in the periphery of the euro zone . 
  ] ( http://speri.dept.shef.ac.uk/2013/11/11/dirty-secret-euro-zone-crisis-german-banks/ ) had the germans not propped up the banking systems in the periphery , they would have faced their own catastrophic banking crisis which would have led to a need to recapitalise their own banks . 
  the loans made by the center to the periphery were made on the basis of cynical self-interest , not heart-warming solidarity to help those experiencing trouble . 
    as for `` austerity '' , a word that has been thorougly demonized , it does n't mean much more than `` when you 're broke , spend less '' . 
  you are broke . 
  spend less . 
  the idea that you have a choice relies on someone else footing the bill . 
  as appealing as your ` household budget ' view of economics might be , austerity does n't mean that . 
  austerity is an ideology to dismantle worker 's rights , state institutions and political and economic sovereignty . 
  it 's not a set of coherent economic policies designed to get a country ` back on its feet ' . 
    that because our countries owe much more than the money we loaned to your small country , we should forgive it ? 
  france and germany and some others have loaned 700 euros to the greek government for each of their citizens . 
  had they not , they would have had to spend the money at home , recapitalising their own banks instead of giving it to the greek government to recapitalise the greek banking system . 
  these populist soundbites are as dishonest and vapid as they are dangerous . 
  they do nothing other than make people in germany hate people in greece . 
  the real issue here is the socialisation of private debt - paid by the * taxpayers of europe * . 
  shitting all over the greeks is not just missing the point , it 's akin to turning around and shooting an orphaned child in the head . 
  if you 're going to blame anybody , blame the german , greek , french , uk , [ insert_country ] and irish politicians who have led us down the path to where we , the common people , are now blindly fighting with each other whilst trillions of euros of private losses have been punted down to us to pay . 
  all the while , we 're told that we must pay for it by making our hospitals shitter as we work for longer for less . 
   but there are other people who believe in their own contradicting believes just as much and maybe one of them is right . 
  except according to [ recently leaked documents ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-troika-analysis-says-significant-concessions-still-needed ) , the troika do n't even believe that their austerity program will solve greece 's economy . 
  even * if * greece adopts all the ` reforms ' , the greek economy is still expected to have unsustainable levels of debt by 2030 . 
  twenty-thirty . 
  three-oh . 
  politics is n't about compromise , it 's about power . 
  what 's happening in greece has got nothing to do with ` helping the greeks get back on their feet ' - it 's a cynical attempt to create a low-wage country on the periphery using shit-tier ideological justifications underpinned by crap economics . 
  it has been used , and will be used as an ideological cudgel to beat back any attempts by other suffering periphery countries to reform the central institutions of the eu . 
  maybe that sounds like overly hostile hyperbole , but when i find myself agreeing with [ a nobel laureate of economics ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/29/joseph-stiglitz-how-i-would-vote-in-the-greek-referendum ) , despite being on the opposite end of the political spectrum , on the sheer level of economic hackery thrown about on discussions pertaining to troikanomics - i do n't accept that it is . 
  fair enough , i did n't realise that you were talking about sending an encrypted message * over * fmb - i thought you were saying that the encryption offered by these services was enough to protect your plaintext messages . 
  simple misunderstanding . 
  otr and pidgin make it much easier though than arsing about with python , 
   even on whatsapp and fbm you can send an encrypted message that the nsa can not read . 
  my point is that * they can read * these messages . 
  your messages are encrypted to and from the fb and wa servers which then relay them onwards to whoever you 're talking to - the nsa have complete access to these servers , so the encryption does n't matter . 
  to make matters worse , the messages are often only encrypted with https , which itself is [ insecure ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-09-06/dear-nsa-thanks-for-making-us-all-insecure ) . 
  rule of thumb , just do n't use popular apps for secure communication . 
   even if they remove encryption and put in a back door to things like whatsapp and fbm christ on a dildo . 
  the nsa already has access to all information stored on facebook and whatsapp servers . 
  do n't use these platforms for any form of communication that you are n't comfortable with having the nsa and it 's allies reading . 
  if you 're looking for encrypted calls and messaging apps , try textsecure and redphone . 
   if all the major corporations actually paid 12.5 % instead of using legal loopholes ~ ~ there would n't be a problem . ~ ~ we would collect 12.5 % of all trading income . 
  the post was clearly about power disparity between countries and international capital , not legal loopholes . 
  many of us here hate the 12.5 % rate of corporation tax . 
  instead of acting in solidarity with other nations , we need to ~ ~ be competitive ~ ~ pander to mnes to attract and retain fdi - our economy is far too dependent on it . 
  if everybody had a flat rate of corporation tax at 50 % , we would n't be tripping over each other to further erode our tax base - which essentially leads to either higher taxes on the individual taxpayer or cuts in public services . 
  only a small , wealthy minority benefits from low rates of corporation tax . 
  until a coordinated plan is put into place on an international level to harmonise corporation tax , mnes will play countries and regions off against each other to pay the least tax that they can . 
  do n't bother mate . 
  when people are quoting shitty reductionist books like * bloodlands * by snyder and upvoting said shitty narratives by the hundreds , you 're so far down the rabbit hole that you 're more likely to have tea with a talking rabbit than find anybody who 'll conduct a conversation in good faith .
