  anyway . 
  zhukov was shit , the soviets signed the molotov-ribbentrop pact because they wanted to be bffs with the nazis and hitler was literally stalin , amirite ? 
  i 'll have my karma now please . 
  well , when you have a member of the azov batallion [ admitting to torture by jamming nails under a pow 's fingers and squeezing his nipples with pliers before threatening to burn him alive ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebrpeos7y1e ) ; i do n't find it hard to believe that they would carry out other war crimes like this . 
  it 's definitely staged - it 'd be nice if people applied their skepticism evenly though . 
  i 've also seen videos of the seperatists interrogating a conscript with a gun to his head , threatening to shoot him if he does n't talk - which is also a war crime . 
  shit is happening on both sides , for some reason though there 's a bit of a blind spot on / r/europe for any criticism of what some forces fighting on the side of the ukrainian government are doing in the seperatist regions . 
  whilst 99 % of the ukranian troops are just normal lads , the brutality of the neonazis that flocked to the conflict from all over europe is particularly disgusting . 
  even moreso that they report to the ministry of affairs . 
  shhh . 
  surely you know by now that our `` liberal '' , pro-eu friends from ukraine here in / r/europe do n't like it when people talk about their [ neo-nazi punishment brigades that report directly to the ministry of affairs ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11025137/ukraine-crisis-the-neo-nazi-brigade-fighting-pro-russian-separatists.html ) ; the same brigade who recently [ crucified and burned to death a separatist pow . 
  ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=5b5_1429903465 ) ** [ nsfw ] ** i find it 's much more fruitful from a karma perspective to just call putin a fascist . 
  people love that shit around here . 
  reform is such an ambiguous , manipulative , shitty word . 
  as you point out , more often than not it 's used to hide socially regressive policies behind a thin veil of pseudo-progressive language . 
  if there 's ever going to be a reintroduction of child labour , it 'll probably be worded like : ' a reform of labour legislation which hopes to give young people the freedoms and opportunities associated with work ' . 
  if you see somebody blathering about ` reform ' always ask ` for whom ? 
  for fuck 's sake . 
  there 's plenty of ways to dishonestly do social research using ostensibly ` normal ' surveys with likert scale responses . 
  this is some next-level low effort shit . 
  they should just save themselves the effort and fabricate the data for their shitty propaganda . 
  i 'd actually have more respect for them . 
  congratulations , you won the jackpot !, 
  we should make an / r/europe bingo that combines the above themes with russophobia and islamophobia . 
  you could play it on 90 % of threads . 
   france is also socialist . 
  parti socialiste is social democratic , not socialist . 
  ** social democracy **  [ social democracy is a political ideology that officially has as its goal the establishment of democratic socialism through reformist and gradualist methods . 
  [ 1 ] ** alternatively , social democracy is defined as a policy regime involving a universal welfare state and collective bargaining schemes within the framework of a capitalist economy . 
  it is often used in this manner to refer to the social models and economic policies prominent in western and northern europe during the latter half of the 20th century . 
  ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democracy ) this is why a distinction is now drawn between * [ democratic socialists ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_socialism ) * and * [ social democrats ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_democracy ) * , the former wish to establish socialism through parliamentary reform , whilst the latter adhere to the the highlighted section above - advocating capitalism in the framework of a welfare state . 
  syriza is a democratic socialist party whilst ps is a social democratic party . 
  merkel and hollande get along well enough because they both sing from the same hymn-sheet . 
  capitalism . 
  free trade . 
  free movement of capital . 
  welfare state . 
  these topics are taken for granted and their squabbles are about degrees of the aforementioned . 
  merkel and tsipras can not , and will not find common ground because , as / u/zombiepiratefrspace rightly says , the issue is ideological . 
  tsipras , varoufakis and many of the members of syriza are socialists of some variety . 
  if you want to offer a critique of syriza , by all means go ahead - but comparing them to ps and then implying that ` hollande gets on well with merkel , sure is n't tsipras is just an awkward bastard ? ', 
  is n't particularly insightful . 
  ireland successfully organised a revolution and a prolonged war of independence against great britain without a so-called ` common sense ' recourse to banning access to british propaganda . 
  we simply did n't have the ability to do so . 
  / u/winturkey makes a valid point , despite your attempts to dismiss them . 
  if you need to ban access to media , it belies a certain degree of social instability and/or lack of cohesion in your society . 
  it 's perfectly clear that not * all * ukrainians agree with the existing arrangement , otherwise a sizable portion of eastern ukraine would n't be in an open state of armed rebellion . 
  you can either agree that censorship is necessary because there are deep divides in your society , divides that must be suppressed for the purpose of ` national security ' - or you can argue that no such divides exist - but you ca n't have it both ways . 
  ** edit : ** for what it 's worth , i do n't ascribe to the idealistic conception that censorship is * inherently * bad , as i would find it difficult to argue that the jacobin 's censorship of french monarchists was a ` bad ' thing during the french revolution . 
  likewise with censorship during the world wars . 
  the point is purely about social cohesion . 
   appeal to authority . 
  avoiding the issue , again . 
  this first part is an offer to engage with vge 's argument , the latter half * could be * construed as an appeal to authority . 
  i 'm hardly surprised that you decided to engage with the latter whilst ignoring the former . 
  intellectual dishonesty seems to be a pathological trait with you . 
   your opinions are not facts . 
  you 're letting your emotions get in the way of sound reasoning . 
  just because you do n't agree with a fact does n't make it an ` opinion ' . 
  again , nice try though . 
   blah blah blah ad hominem when confronted with ad hominem attacks , you hardly expect me to put more effort into this exchange than you yourself are willing to put in ? 
  do n't be so entitled . 
  i did n't define or narrow the discussion - i simply brought it back on topic , away from getting entangled over the concept of subsidiarity . 
  i ca n't tell if you 're too pig-headed or too stupid to concede the point ; either way i have little interest in continuing this little spat which has become focused on you trying to patch up your wounded ego . 
  feel free to go get your kicks somewhere else . 
   if people do n't bother looking up facts and information , no debate is possible . 
  so you dispute vge 's position ? 
  pray tell , what makes you more knowledgeable on the internal mechanations of the eu than an ex-french president ? 
   there 's no engaging a rant / rhetoric * rhetoric * - [ language designed to have a persuasive or impressive effect , but which is often regarded as lacking in sincerity or meaningful content ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/rhetoric ) your retort to / u/rhamni 's claim that `` the decisions have been moved further away from the people '' is to point to the concept of subsidiarity which neither contributes , nor undermines the point that they made . 
  this is rhetoric . 
  it 's not an insult , or an attack on your person - it 's simply a fact . 
  so stop whining about it . 
  it 's pathetic . 
   can you say projection ? 
  translation : heuheuheuhehu i 'm going to avoid the point by making an ad hominem attack with vague allusions to psychoanalysis to make me look very smart . 
  bringing the discussion back to the point is not redefining the discussion . 
  nice try though . 
  you had the opportunity to engage like / u/boq - but instead you decided to be a snarky prick . 
  for what it 's worth , i 'm actually for total european integration - i just do n't like the way it 's happening . 
  thanks for contributing . 
  i understand the concept of subsidiarity ; i was addressing / u/catch215 's use of rhetoric which gives the impression of addressing , yet actually narrows and shifts ( quite successfully ) the discussion away from / u/rhamni 's point that :  the decisions have been moved further away from the people the discussion is ultimately about whether or not ` decisions have been moved further away from the people ' - throwing out the fact that individual parliaments have a large degree of agency in the formation of national legislation does n't negate / u/rhamni 's point . 
   anyway , you are twisting vge 's words there a bit . 
  in what way am i twisting a series of direct quotes by a centrist politician which point towards a deliberate move by eu leadership to avoid referendums and increase the opaqueness of rejected legislation to enable it to be passed ? 
   hence the change in approach , to make it less grand , less of a symbol and more of the boring reform that it really was . 
  you 're significantly downplaying the importance of the ` boring reform ' which led to the appointment of a ` high representative ' for the foreign affairs council who also oversees the external action service - which acts as a de facto foreign office for the union , the formation of the ecb as an official institution and the opening of dialogue on the european security and defence policy which foresees a common defence policy for the eu . 
  all of these ` boring reforms ' seem very much in line with what was rejected in form by citizens in france , ireland and the netherlands . 
  saying that they rejected it on symbolic grounds is a tad insulting , unless you have concrete evidence to prove otherwise . 
   evidently , no government was ousted for its approval of the lisbon treaty , so the population seems to have been okay with the new approach . 
  the yanks did n't oust their government for passing something as universally reviled as the patriot act , so i 'd hardly put the `` ousting '' of a government as a useful measure of public content over the passing of legislation or a treaty . 
   additionally , i was n't in ireland in 2008/9 , so i ca n't speak to your claim of economic scaremongering . 
  obviously we 're into the area of subjectivity here . 
  i do n't know if there has been any sort of poll conducted post-referendum to determine key issues that affected voting preference - but the manipulation of economic insecurity was was [ well known as a campaign tactic at the time ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/6257442/ireland-givesconvincing-yes-vote-to-lisbon-treaty.html ) . 
   the eu actually requires decisions to be taken as far down the chain as possible . 
  do n't make me laugh . 
  the french rejected a european constitution in 2005 with a ~ 55 % majority and the dutch with a ~ 61 % majority . 
  after this rejection , the idea of a constitution was abolished in favour of passing the rejected constitution in a more subversive manner as a series of piecemeal reforms . 
  french ex-president val\u00e9ry giscard d\u2019estaing on this matter :  `` the difference between the original constitution and the present lisbon treaty is one of approach , rather than content ... the proposals in the original constitutional treaty are practically unchanged . 
  they have simply been dispersed through old treaties in the form of amendments . 
  why this subtle change ? 
  above all , to head off any threat of referenda by avoiding any form of constitutional vocabulary ...
