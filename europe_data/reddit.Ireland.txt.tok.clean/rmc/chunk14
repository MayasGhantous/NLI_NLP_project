  you 're just outright refusing to even think about it . 
  sometimes saying `` i know so little about the topic that i 'm not even going to pretend , but will rely on people who know more about it than me '' , is a very wise thing to do . 
  ( a ) no-one mentioned the truth or falsehood of that statement ( except for you just now ) . 
  a statement can be statistically true and still be racist . 
  ( b ) the original statement is poorly defined and vague , meaning that any attempt to figure out if it 's true is almost impossible . 
  what makes something `` worthwhile '' , what is a `` civilisation '' , what 's a `` worthwhile civilisation '' , what makes one culture `` superiour '' to another ? 
  what 's `` africa '' ? 
  what 's `` europe '' ? 
  ( do the ancient egyptians count as `` african '' ? 
  what about the jews ? 
  the ancient greeks had lots of city states in africa ( e.g. 
  the library of alexandria ) , do they count as african or european ? 
  do roma count as `` european '' ? 
  do jews ? 
  do ancient romans count as european ? 
  do russians ? 
  etc. ), 
  often people will have no actual rational reason for answers to this question except the answers that match their emotive tribal allegiance . 
  ( c ) additionally many people approach this topic `` knowing the answer '' and looking for anything to support it , rather than being scientific and rational . 
  there is almost no point in engaging in someone in this argument because you ca n't change their mind away from `` white europeans are better than jews/roma / they lump all people they call `` white '' into one group so that they can claim all advantages of all these groups . 
  ( apparently irish people are now white in the uk & usa , gone are the days of `` no blacks , no dogs , no irish '' ) . 
  they also downplay or ignore any disadvantages of their arbitrary white grouping and ignore any advantages of their arbitrary black grouping . 
  they cherry pick results that just match their tribal allegiances . 
  it 's not really a fair question . 
  the funny is that lots of people were getting `` the solar system '' and `` the universe '' mixed up . 
  the answers were either ( a ) 1 or ( b ) `` millions '' . 
  so people do roughly know the basics of science , they are just getting confused by terminology . 
  you 'll note no-one answered actual idiotic questions like `` there are only a few of them a few miles up '' or `` they are spy satillites from the government '' or `` each one is an alien space ship '' . 
  it 's like trying to trick someone in a word game . 
  they 'll get it in a minute /, 
  third option : we all become part of one unified eu state . 
  but y' know , apparently calling them racist is wrong and hurts their feelings ... 
  the [ top voted comment on this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14oq15/racism_in_this_subreddit_is_out_of_control/c7f28hn ) says `` people who complain about racists are as bad as racists '' . 
  wtf . 
   someone else , in the same thread , posted a ridiculously overtly racist cartoon regarding `` self hating whites '' , including the whole evil big-nosed jew stereotype and the worst kind of african caricature . 
  yep , that was a reply to one of my posts . 
  it was a extremely racist and hateful post . 
  my point is that there is only one `` extreme '' , the mad racist `` blacks are n't human '' side . 
  the worst anyone can come up with for the other side is `` they 'll accuse you of being hitler '' . 
  what 's the opposite of hitler 's racist policies ? 
  that 's the other extreme , and i 'm unsure if it exists ... 
   i do n't associate racism with left or right . 
  i was using that as ends of a scale , hence my use of quotes . 
  however currently racism is strongly correlated with `` right wing '' political groups . 
   while almost everyone in the us and eu would agree that all races should be treated equally that statement , in the history of race relations , was a massively radical view . 
  go back 50 or 100 years , and the things people could say in polite company are * far * more racist than that view . 
  even on the history of 20th century , that is not the middle ground , that 's far to the `` racism is bad '' side of the equation . 
  it is * now * middle ground , because society has moved on . 
  the vast majority of the population are far from the centre on racism , and are far to the `` all races should be treated equally '' side of the equation . 
  it 's like how most people are far from the centre on the democracy issue , etc. 
   some people just assume that anyone who opposes immigration in its current form does so because of racism . 
  but , a lot of it is based on racist beliefs and feelings . 
  no , i meant `` left of middle '' in terms of racism . 
  think about what used to be acceptable levels of racism , let 's put all that at one end , and call it the `` right '' , so things like nazi 's genocide of jews & racial superiority laws . 
  then moving rightwards we roughly get : slavery based on race is legal , no slavery , but it 's illegal to teach ( say ) black people how to read , enforced segration of races in marriage & education ( e.g. 
  apartheid south africa ) , making discrimination like that outright illegal ( all modern laws in eu & usa ) , ... i 'm not sure what 's at the other end ( the `` left '' side ) , do you know ? 
  `` people who act as if anyone who is not favor of mass immigration is literally hitler '' is an example given earlier , but `` oh no someone called me hitler '' seems so massively less worse than `` all black people are property and not real humans '' , that i do n't think `` being called hitler '' is the opposite of it . 
  the vast majority of people ( even in eu & usa ) are far to the `` left '' of the middle of the racism scale . 
  after all the vast majority of the population ( of eu & usa ) think that it should be legal for ( say ) 2 people of different ethnicities/races to marry . 
  that 's so far from `` black people are property '' . 
  vast majority of the people are far from the centre on `` race '' . 
  the vast majority of the population are muuuuuuch more to the `` left '' than the `` right '' . 
  that could be selection bias . 
  we tend to hand around with and socialise with people who share our beliefs . 
  they 're out there though . 
   i 'd be more inclined to say `` the problem with these posts is that they 're hateful / abusive / stupid '' than that they 're racist . 
  i have no problem calling those quoted posts what they are : racist posts . 
  someone literally said `` blacks never produced any worthwhile civilization and they certainly do n't have the military prowess to invade france . 
  colonialism made sense because we spread our superior culture and genes in africa '' . 
  how is that * not * racist ?!, 
   the goal of a discussion should be to find an outcome both sides can agree with , not really . 
  some people * are * crazy right wing racists who want to kill all the jews/blacks/roma / gays/whatever . 
  how can one find common ground with that ? 
  sometimes people are just * wrong * . 
  got an example of someone saying `` anyone who is not favor of mass immigration is literally hitler '' ? 
  i ca n't recall it . 
  additionally , i know it must suck when someone calls someone a racist , but being a victim of racism is worse . 
  no , there is wealth of evidence that class background has a massive impact on iq . 
  as that link says :  its central argument is that human intelligence is substantially influenced by both inherited and ** environmental factors ** and is a better predictor of many personal dynamics , including financial income , job performance , chance of unwanted pregnancy , and involvement in crime than are an individual 's parental socioeconomic status , or education level . 
  people in usa seem to think there is no class system in the usa . 
  that if you just work hard enough , then you can be president etc. 
  this book partially addresses that issue . 
  the freaking by line for the cover of that book ( see your wikipedia link ) says '' `` intelligence and class structure in american life '' . 
  until you can separate race from iq it 's meaningless to look at 2 things that are so closely correlated in the usa . 
  apparently iq tests in northern ireland show white catholics scoring lower than white protestants . 
  does that mean whites are stupier than whites ? 
  or is iq more heavily influenced by economics ? 
   so the superiority of white civilization over black civilization for the past 3000 years is only due to environmental factors ? 
  it is incorrect that there has `` superiority of white civilisation over black civilisation for 3000 years '' . 
  how do you define `` black civilisation '' and `` white civilisation '' ? 
  do the romans count as white ? 
  what about ancient greeks ? 
  what about ancient persians ? 
  what about ancient egyptians ? 
  there are some examples of better technology in africa at some points than some parts of europe ( e.g. 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_zimbabwe ) . 
  there were also raids on lots of europe ( incl . 
  england ) of slave traders from africa , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbary_slave_trade this is n't as clear cut as you make it out to be . 
   whites have contributed far more than blacks to the advancement of mankind towards our goal to spread life across space is that your only criteria ? 
  the space race ?
