  by that standard the english are a useless race having done nothing to send someone to space . 
  there have been more than twice as many african americans in space as uk ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_african-american_astronauts vs http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_space_programme#british_astronauts ( and 2 of the 6 uk were self funded ! ) ) . 
  should we get rid of all the british ? 
  they 're worse than the blacks !, 
  right ?!, 
  or are you arbitrarily choosing what sounds like a decent goal ( space race ) , but ignoring any races that have done very little . 
   not quite sure what you 're getting at with the ` catholic types ' though . 
  irish ethnicity people in england . 
  catholic types vs. anglo-saxons . 
  ( i could n't come up with a better name than `` catholic types '' ), 
  there is no evidence that white people have superior genes . 
  the phrase `` worthwhile civilisation '' is meaningless , and vague . 
  what makes you think the british/french/germans / italians/etcetc . 
  are a ` civilisation ' . 
  yep there are people out there who think there 's a vast jewish conspiracy ( see cartoon ) to destroy the white race . 
  did you not hear what the nazis did ? 
  mind you , i think it * should * be expanded beyond those cases ... that 's a different matter . 
   that 's racism :d did you read my definition above ? 
  no , that 's not racism under one defintion of racism . 
  no-one suggesting that . 
  what makes you go from `` hey maybe race relations is complex '' to `` i support someone raping my wife '' !, 
  you 're cherry picking examples or rare edge cases . 
   i will bet you that the percentage of people suddenly moving from being very poor to being middle class or even rich ( over night ) is the same for all races . 
  you 're talking about `` overnight '' , something that rarely every happens . 
  you ca n't ignore the non-rare things  think of european immigrants to the us . 
  while a tiny percentage might have reached the middle class in a few years , the vast majority took an entire generation to reach us `` middle-class '' . 
  why are you only looking at european immigrants ? 
  what about african ` immigrants ' to the usa ? 
  it 's factually incorrect to say `` the vast majority of them became middle class after first arriving in usa '' . 
  what about the common cases ? 
   by your argument , white immigrants to the uk from eastern europe should be deprived of aid because they 're the wrong color . 
  there seems to be common idea that `` racism '' is only between `` white '' and `` black '' ( or `` asian '' etc. ) . 
  there seems to be an idea that all `` white '' people are the same race . 
  this is not what ( any ) law about racism says . 
  just about all law on racism * includes * `` ethnicity '' ( can you find a law ( anywhere ) that includes `` race '' but not `` ethnicity '' ? 
  i ca n't ) this means a polish immigrant to the uk ( say ) does legally count as a separate race/ethnicity to ( say ) a traditional white english person . 
   it 's either aid for all , including white immigrants and indigenous poor people or no aid for anyone . 
  no , it does n't have to be that . 
  we spend money on immigrants , and we spend money on people who are sick . 
  we spend money on people who are sick when they are children and we spend money giving to the arts , we spend money on giving students grants to university . 
  where did this weird `` all or nothing '' situtation come from ? 
  not me . 
   what about rape victims ? 
  physical or emotional threats from family ? 
  abusive husbands ? 
  there would need to a referendum in ireland to allow abortion in those cases . 
  current irish constitution only allows abortion in cases of threat to mother 's life . 
  what is highly likely ( nay practically guaranteed ) is that there will be irish law in line with the constitution . 
  that is what i meant when i said `` it will happen '' . 
  you 've basically described `` intersectionality '' ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intersectionality ) or `` kyriarchy '' ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kyriarchy ) . 
  which is where a person ( e.g. 
  a rich black man ) might be advantaged in one regard ( being rich and being a man ) , but disadvantaged in another regard ( being black ) . 
  likewise a poor white gay male has advantages ( being white , being male ) but also has disadvantages ( being poor , being gay ) . 
  so yes , there are poor white people , and yes we should try to help them . 
  but who says we should only have * one * kind of aid ? 
  here 's a thought , let 's have lots of types !, 
  let 's have something that helps people of ethnic minorities , * and * something that helps people with low incomes * and * something that helps people of gender & sexual minorities * and * something that helps people with chronic illnesses * and * helps people with learning difficultues * and * * and * and * etc. 
  basically this shit is * complex * ( hey human lives are complex , whoddathunk it ? ), 
  irish people only kiss if you 're in a romantic or sexual relationship . 
  much like the uk really ... 
  well , that 's what happens when you around the place plundering national treasures . 
  eventually you might have to give them back . 
   a magnificent horse 's head is among sculptures ** acquired ** by the british museum in the mid-19th century ha !, 
  i do n't know the specifics of this case , but * acquired * is often used by thieves . 
  what would uk think if turkey went over and took stonehenge over to turkey ? 
  there are several definitions of racism , one is essentially `` making references to someone 's race and implying everyone in that group is the same ( in some attribute ) '' , or more simply `` anything based on race '' . 
  lots of people like this definition because it 's a nice , simple and objective defintion and it means black people in the uk can be racist to white people , or that affirmative action is racist . 
  i think this is the definition you 're using . 
  there 's another definition , which is that racist actions are actions that 's designed to maintain & reinforce the institutionalised power structure among races . 
  right now , if modern uk life was a video game , `` white male '' would be an easier difficulty level than `` black male '' . 
  there are statistically less problems for the `` white male '' group . 
  racist actions is talk that re-enforced that imbalance , and attempts to undo the power imbalance is not racist . 
  this definition is harder for some people to accept because it means that you need to look at yourself and think about what power imbalances you might be benefiting from , and it means that affirmative action is not racist , and attempts to stop is could be construed as racist ( since stopping affirmative action can re-enforce power imbalances ) . 
  this is the definition i use . 
  so no , saying `` how white she is '' is n't racist speech . 
   for how much longer are we going to keep letting these useless morons invade us ? 
  i think , historically speaking , the english and germans have done the most invasions of france ( or within the rest of europe ) . 
  should we get rid of them ? 
  define white please . 
  do nordic ethnicity count ? 
  what about greek or scillian ? 
  are they all `` white '' ? 
  what about catholic types ? 
  yes it will happen . 
  however it will only happen in extreme cases where a woman is likely to * die * unless she has an abortion . 
  the only thing the far right dislike about the law is that it calls bluff on their word games ( where they claim an abortion is n't an abortion ) , and that it will have to include the risk of suicide , and many right wingers do n't believe mental health exists . 
  there is a left wing party in coalition , and they are pushing for this . 
  the olympic stadium for london 2012 was the first olympic stadium to be built without any fatalities . 
  modern health & safety saves lifes . 
  additionally if lax employment laws were so great ( e.g. 
  employers allowed to fire anyone for ( almost ) any reason ) , how come the usa ( which has ` at will ' laws like this ) is n't doing so brilliantly economically ? 
  sounds like you think the uk should have a consitution , which would require referenda etc. 
  is a `` common market approach '' actual an option ? 
  is this something any other eu countries want ? 
  or are offering uk ? 
  does n't `` common market '' include labour law aswell ? 
  does n't that mean citizens of all member states would be about to live & work in uk ? 
  what exactly is the `` social chapter '' ? 
  it 's all well and good to desire to say `` back to common market '' , but if no-one is offering a common market only approach , then that 's not a real option , right ? 
  that 's `` the iron lady '' .
