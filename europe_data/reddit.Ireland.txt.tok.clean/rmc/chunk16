  i thought it was good as a film , i.e. 
  it was enjoyable and they were able to make you like the main character . 
  but as a history or insight into the `` thatcher years '' of the uk ( i.e. 
  the 1980s ) it was poor . 
  you 'd learn more by watching `` hunger '' and `` billy elliot '' . 
  +1 for yes minister , and the follow up yes prime minister . 
  totally applicable to any modern polictial system . 
  `` the hollowmen '' is a great australian political satire , like yes minister . 
   an assumption based on trends that most of the time turns out to be right . 
  just because it 's an accurate statement does n't mean it 's * not * racist . 
  so you do n't think troublesome migrants should be exiled . 
  ok , what should happen to troublesome migrants ? 
   perhaps deporting those who fail to contribute to society ? 
  ok , to where ? 
  do you have an island somewhere to send people ? 
  if you 're going to send them to another country , are you prepared if that country does n't take them ? 
  what are you going to do ? 
  some sort of d-day landing of forcing your way into another country ? 
   got a welsh aunties who always find her irsh friend on st.patricks day to remind them he was welsh . 
  not sure if true or just bit of banter . 
  yep st. patrick was a romano-briton slave kidnapped and taken to ireland . 
  dunno if it 's fair to say he was ` welsh ' , since at the time the scottish were in ireland , the english were in germany and the welsh were in england at the time . 
  there have been wars fought over that . 
  irish people caused no end of crime and terrorism in the uk . 
  should the uk kick out all the people of irish race ? 
  or is it just the migrants du jour and dark skinned people that should be `` taken care of '' ? 
   how can we continue to accept immigrants knowing that these places are just going to get worse ? 
  so your solution is no more migration ? 
  you 're fine with the current levels of non-nationals ? 
  what 's your proposed solution ? 
  `` scotland '' ( the word ) comes from the latin `` scotti '' and '' - land '' ( the germanic for land '' . 
  `` scotti '' means `` irish '' ( or gael ) . 
  so `` scotland '' means `` irish-person-land '' !, 
   ninja-edit : by down south i mean the republic of ireland hilariously , there are parts of ( republic of ) ireland that are more north than northern ireland . 
  donegal , where the north is to the south ... 
   a state being a government . 
  but then you get confusing because in the usa a state is a subunit of a country ( the usa , one country is made up of 50 states ) , whereas in the ireland case , `` state '' is one country . 
  then you 've the uk which is one nation ( or state ? ), 
  but made up of 4 countries . 
  and pre-celtic . 
  i read about dna testing of pre-celtic bones/bodies found in england and they closly match dna of people currenlty in england . 
  i 've started using `` celtic isles '' to annoy the anglo-saxon english :p, 
   on the other hand irish i think feel the need to differentiate themselves from the british and may overcompensate . 
  reminds me of a skit from an irish comedian , tommy tiernan , who was doing a gig in ireland : `` it 's great to be back in ireland '' * crowd cheers * `` where we 're all proud to be irish '' * cheers * `` but we 've no idea what it means '' * cheers * `` it 's means we 're not english ! '', 
  * big cheers * that 's basically it . 
  `` we 're not english '' is a large determining factor . 
   supported their football teams the vast majority of irish people who watch/enjoy football follow uk premier league teams . 
  uk football is massive in ireland . 
   where britain leads ireland often follows . 
  oh yes . 
  irish politics often just copies uk for laws etc. 
  mostly cause our politicians ( like most politicians ) are stupid . 
  there has been so much mixing of blood in europe . 
  you probably have viking/danish blood aswell . 
  we are all one family . 
  eh , the terms like `` irish nation '' or `` state '' etc. 
  are complicated , and one can get into weird definition arguments often with the veneer of neutrality but the end goal of ` proving ' that one side is right . 
  addition the term `` irish nation '' is n't really defined , what does it mean ? 
  no-one really uses it unless one is being poetic . 
  the term `` state '' is used in irish law , government and politics . 
  however , it 's not used in uk law ( afaik ) . 
  so the irish government considers northern ireland to not be in the state , but i do n't think the uk government would consider n.i. 
  a state . 
  so is ni a state ? 
  even the term `` ulstermen '' is problematic , 3 of the 9 counties of ulster are in ireland !, 
  people from donegal , cavan and monaghan are in ulster and are irish !, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/british_isles_naming_dispute from the irish government ( http://www.oireachtas-debates.gov.ie/d/0606/d.0606.200509280360.html ) :  the british isles is not an officially recognised term in any legal or inter-governmental sense . 
  it is without any official status . 
  the government , including the department of foreign affairs , does not use this term . 
  there are often geographic naming disputes . 
  a definition from wikipedia does not settle the argument . 
  ok , i figured it would n't be all rosy . 
  but i just wanted an example of 2 countries that were n't in europe that irish/uk people might not feel as ` related to ' as to each other . 
  oooooooooooohhhhhh controversial !, 
  :p * ( was that intentional ? 
   ) * if not , irish people often do n't refer to it as the british isles . 
  ( also ffs it 's not `` patty 's day '' :p ), 
   i thought the ulstermen were decended from scottish planters/presbyterian 's ? 
  yes that is correct . 
  but some people would view them as `` different '' / `` the invader '' / `` not irish '' / `` the other side '' . 
  which is ridiculus imo . 
   one thing i would like to put out there , england obviously gets a lot of stick . 
  but a few considerations : oh i know , that 's why i put `` invaded '' in quotation marks . 
  there are still people in ireland who 'd say `` wales is controlled by england , right ? '', 
  needless to say , many people 's understanding of history is , ahem , simplistic and politically biased . 
  the common idea is that ireland was controlled by england for `` 800 years '' . 
   we were talking about this on / r/unitedkingdom and i percieved that someone from the uk would more likely consider someone from ireland as similar than someone from ireland would of them . 
  interesting thought . 
  i suppose on factor is relative-ness . 
  i 'd presume if it 's just 10 irish people and 10 uk people in a room , the group might divide that way ( e.g. 
  if there was a simple football match ) , but if it was 5 irish people , 5 uk people , 5 chinese people and 5 vietnamese people , the irish & uk people would probably join up that way . 
  i do n't think there 's one rule that applies in all cases . 
  likewise you could say something with english/spanish/chinese / vietnamese . 
  what do you think ? 
  irish here . 
  i suppose we 'd feel a little close to the welsh & scottish . 
  both countries being `` invaded '' by england . 
  however both are mostly non-catholic , which historically would be a large factor in irish identity . 
  there would not be many irish legends or histories that would overlap with wales/scotland though . 
  irish people would also know a lot more about the uk/england than other countries in europe , due to so many irish people living there .
