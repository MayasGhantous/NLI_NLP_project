  irish people would also a slight affinity towards the usa & americans . 
  so many irish people emmigrated there , and so many irish americans claim irish ancestry ( yes even barack obama :p ) . 
   than why not go with the common societal interpretation ? 
  as i point out from many legal sources , the common interpretation does mean `` no frenchies '' in germany would count as racism . 
   if you ask most common people , they identify races as white ( european ) , black ( sub-saharan african ) , south asian , east asian , amerindian , etc. 
  citation needed . 
  what about italians vs. nordics ? 
  many people might think they are not the same race . 
  if you start asking people things like this , they 'll start getting confuddled , and searching for words , since they think these 2 groups are different . 
  likewise people in one area might think they are n't the same people , or belong to the same group as some other part of europe . 
   think that racism is a term thrown around too commonly probably should stop doing racist things then . 
  i understand that it might make people feel uncomfortable and insulted when someone points out `` that 's racist '' . 
  but you know what 's worse ? 
  being the victim of actual racism . 
  it is very hard to actually have a `` cultural bias '' without it actually being racist . 
  it 's just that a lot of people have a lot of racist tendencies and want to do racist actions , however really really do n't like when it 's pointed out that the thing is racist , so try to come up with all these justifications like `` oh that 's not real racism '' , or `` i just want to get rid of all the gypses , it 's like not liking indian food ! '' . 
  there 's nothing wrong with not liking indian food . 
  there 's something wrong with not liking that there are indians living on your street . 
  another one : the un defined `` racial discrimination '' to include `` ethnic '' & `` national origin '' : ( http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm )  1 . 
  in this convention , the term `` racial discrimination '' shall mean any distinction , exclusion , restriction or preference based on race , colour , descent , or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition , enjoyment or exercise , on an equal footing , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural or any other field of public life . 
  the more i read , the more it looks like * all * defintions of `` racism '' include nationality or ethnicity . 
  is there any legal defintion of `` racism '' that would match your `` europeans ca n't be racist to each other '' idea ? 
   european peoples are generally considered to be of the same race -- white really ? 
  that 's the one interpretation . 
  there are many other interpretations . 
  for example the eu does n't believe in the existance of more than one race at all !!, 
   ( 6 ) the european union rejects theories which attempt to determine the existence of separate human races . 
  from directive 2000/43/ec : http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=celex:32000l0043:en:html another definition : under irish law `` discrimination on the grounds of race '' applies on discrimination on the grounds of race , colour , nationality , ethnic origins or national origins ( http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0021/print.html#sec6 ) . 
  * another * defintion : uk anti-discrimination/anti-racially-motivated - assaults law define `` racial group '' ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/37/part/ii/crossheading/raciallyaggravated-offences-england-and-wales ) as :  in this section `` racial group '' means a group of persons defined by reference to race , colour , nationality ( including citizenship ) or ethnic or national origins . 
  so yes , if an english person were to be motivated to beat up an irish person ( in england ) , then that could count as a racially motived crime . 
  all these `` but that 's not * racism * '' claims just sounds like people trying to play word games in order to continue to do what is essentially racist discrimination . 
  so why are you right ? 
   i think coe and echr membership is mandatory for eu members so leaving means leaving the eu . 
  coe & echr is also mandatory for eea membership ( i think ) . 
  i 'm mostly wondering if the uk can ` escape ' the echr , as some tabloids might desire . 
   there 's also the issue that uk judges have a far stronger sense that the echr is a superior court to any uk court and will punish the government for opposing it . 
  other eu countries have pretty much ignored smaller rulings of echr because their legal system does n't have such a clear opinion on superiority . 
  really ? 
  got a source ? 
  i thought the uk was odd ( legally ) due to it 's courts not being able to override parliament . 
  in some countries ( e.g. 
  ireland ) with a constitution , a court can override laws . 
  however it looks like the echr is n't part of the constitution , so it ca n't override it . 
  any particular reason or motivation ? 
  i do n't know and would like to find out . 
   sure , they 'd just say `` we will no longer honor this treaty '' and withdraw , similar to how germany and others left the league of nations . 
  it 's not like somebody will call the cops on them . 
  oh i know they can leave . 
  i was just wondering what the consequences would be to uk leaving coe . 
   european union = / = europe = / = council of europe i know !, 
  and that 's my question . 
  since russia is n't in eu or eea , it does n't * have * to sign up to coe & echr ( right ?!, 
  ) , so why does it ? 
  correct . 
  look at a uk passport . 
  it lists nationality as `` british citizen '' . 
  do the people of the town get cheaper or better products/services than they used to ? 
   there is no race difference here i disagree . 
  that sort of discrimination ( frenchmen vs. german ) is racism . 
   my understanding is that the `` no irish '' signs were because of religious differences , because protestants had a real hatred for catholics . 
  wrong , sure , prejudiced , absolutely , but i would n't call that racist either because there is simply no race involved . 
  yes there is a race involved . 
  `` irish '' . 
  various countries laws state this is a race . 
  people in ireland ( & england/britain ) will claim they are not the same race/ethnicity as each other . 
  there are other examples such as irish people working in england in the 1960s/70s/80s who were spied on by employers & the ( uk ) state with the presumption that they were terrorists , merely because they were one race . 
  that 's very little to do with religion . 
   maybe this is just me , but i ca n't for the life of me tell whether someone is a gypsy until they start doing something typically associated with gypsies . 
  maybe it is just you & the area you 're in . 
  here roma people dress a very distinctly way , and accents can be very different . 
  just do a google image search for `` roma gypsy '' or likewise and you 'll see the sort of clothing i 'm talking about . 
   i 've been told there are a lot of gypsies who wear pajamas everywhere they go this is very local dependent . 
  in my area lower economic class women would often wear pajamas outside . 
  they are not roma ( nor are they the local irish travellers ) . 
  again , depends what people in the local area do . 
   i think that when people cry `` racism '' at this issue or , y' know , it 's actual racism . 
  that has n't gone away . 
  there have been racist genocides in europe in the last 15 years . 
  what makes you think it 's not racism if you ca n't tell from looking at them ? 
  it can still be racist . 
  can someone in the uk tell the difference between and irish person and british person ? 
  if htey ca n't does that mean a `` no irish '' sign is not racist ? 
  no , it 's still racist . 
  roma often wear certain clothes styles and in my city , i think they look different ( usually shorter afaik ) . 
  or homo-sapiens go home in neanderthal ? 
  or it 's people who do n't like when other people point out their racist actions/desires ? 
  my point is that `` culturalism '' almost ca n't exist independent of `` racism '' . 
  just about any `` culturalism '' claim is nearly always racist . 
  just about any `` racist '' claim can be seen as `` culturalism '' . 
  xenophobia is wrong . 
  every european culture and people have moved . 
  should the english go back to germany ? 
  should the scottish go back to ireland ? 
  `` culturalism '' is often just a way to be racist without using the r word . 
  what 's a culture ? 
  is `` british '' a culture ? 
  is `` italian '' ? 
  is `` african '' ? 
  is `` jew '' ? 
  so if `` racism = not ok , culturalism = ok '' , then you 've basically ( depending on one 's definition of `` culture '' ) got a claim to any amount of racism being ok .
