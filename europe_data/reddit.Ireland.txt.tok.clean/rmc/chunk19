  sorta . 
  it 's not as easy to get as rest of uk . 
  abortion in ireland suffers from the `` irish solution to an irish problem '' . 
  irish people are legally allowed to go to uk ( or elsewhere ) for abortion . 
  so the issue is avoided by the politicans so as to not shake the boat . 
  ireland used to be very catholic 1 generation ago . 
  now less so . 
  this is a period of social change . 
   was the catholic church some symbol against the british perhaps ? 
  exactly . 
  a lot of irish people associate `` catholic '' with `` ethnic irish '' . 
  that 's why so many people tick `` catholic '' on the census form . 
   i raland obviously allows for abortion when woman 's life is threatened . 
  not really . 
  there is no way to know if you qualify for abortion . 
  there is no law . 
  there are no guidelines and no cases . 
  you have to go to the uk . 
   do you know how many who does that each year ? 
  at least 5,000 irish women go abroad for abortions each year . 
  this is about 7 % of pregnancies in ireland . 
   is that the case even in cases of rape , incest , underage etc ? 
  in republic of ireland , no . 
  if you 're suicidal you has as much rights as this in this case , which is to say `` technically yes '' in reality `` no '' . 
  if you were raped and/or underage and carrying the pregnancy to term would n't harm you , then you are not legally entitled to an abortion in ireland . 
  that is illegal under irish law . 
  the solution is to go to england . 
  abortion is similarly restricted in northern ireland . 
  and abortion is illegal in northern ireland /, 
  actually no , the f\u0153tus was dead or dying . 
  the pregnancy could n't have completed to term . 
  update : it was a miscarriage that drew out . 
  they would n't do anything until they could n't detect a f\u0153tal heartbeat . 
  it took 2 1/2 days of pain . 
  the irish constitution says that abortions are illegal unless the mother 's life is at risk . 
  but there is no law that actually says what that means . 
  the only law is from 1860s which says all abortion is illegal ( from well before the constitution or this section ) . 
  there is no way for a doctor to know if a certain patient or case qualifies as a legal abortion or an illegal abortion . 
  there is a massive grey area and doctors are limited and do n't know if they 'll break the law or not !, 
  oh there 's no end of american vs. ( say ) british english dialect differences . 
   i keep hearing the term `` uni '' uni means university . 
  it 's a term common in uk , but less common in ireland . 
  ( dunno about how anglophones in rest of eu translate stuff ) . 
  a hint : in ireland & uk `` school '' does n't refer to univeristy , so if you talk to an english person who 's at `` uni '' , do n't ask them what school they went to . 
  there is n't really much geographic cause , you could maybe write a paper * disproving * the `` geographic cause '' ,, 
  * stupid me , not fulling reading things . 
  that makes much more sense . 
  that puts uk \u2194 eu trade at about # 134bil ( $ 170bil ) / # 195bil ( $ 245 bil ) per year , about 3 \u2192 4 times norway or switzerland . 
  ok this makes more sense . 
    a third of our business dealing are with europe , and not just financial transactions , exports are a large part of this  third ? 
  i heard half ... wonder what the real number is . 
  actually tis about half . 
  uk gov site says ~ uk \u2194 eu trade is # 11.2 bil / # 16.2 bil [ 1 ] and uk \u2194 non-eu is # 11.2 bil / # 17bil [ 2 ] . 
  so about half of uk foreign trade ( imports & exports ) is with the rest of the eu . 
   they think the uk can get a batter deal than norway and switzerland because ` they need us more than we need them ' ok this is odd . 
  ** nevermind i 'm wrong , got confused by monthly & yearly figures ** uk government site ( https://www.uktradeinfo.com/statistics/euoverseastrade/pages/euots.aspx ) says uk \u2192 eu exports are # 11.2 bil ( ~ $ 14bil ) this year , and eu \u2192 uk imports to # 16.2 bil ( ~ $ 20bil ) , both figures from year-to-date-2012 ( historical graph is shows relatively consistant numbers ) * however * , the european commission says ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/creating-opportunities/bilateral-relations/countries/norway/ ) eu \u2192 norway trade is $ 43bil , $ 91bil the other way , and for switzerland ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/creating-opportunities/bilateral-relations/countries/switzerland/ ) it 's $ 47bil & $ 67bil . 
  * ( i may have got these numbers the wrong way around , but the point still stands ) * does that mean ** norway ( or switzerland ) is a larger trading partner to eu than uk ?!?!? 
  ** i know there are some differences ( norway \u2192 eu trade might go partially to uk , figures from 2012 for uk vs 2008 for no/ch , etc. ) . 
  however it strikes me as well weird that the uk , with a larger population ( \u00d7 10 norway , ~ \u00d7 7 1/2 switzerland ) , and larger gdp ( \u00d7 5 norway , \u00d7 7 switzerland ) is roughly the same ( or less ) with eu trade !!, 
  have i calculated wrong ?!, 
   we still have to enact eu legislation and pay to be in but it 's a lot less than currently i 'm curious , what eu does a eea member * not * have to implement ? 
  my little research implies you have to implement employment law , which surely the conservatives do n't like , so what 's the point ? 
  what laws do you free yourself from ? 
  the more i read about norway/eu and switzerland/eu , i ca n't see the point . 
  norway & switzerland have to adopt much eu law , and allow eu citizens to move there and live there , have to pay towards the eu etc. 
  if one wanted full separation , and have full control over ( say ) immigration , does n't that mean you 'd have to leave the common market ? 
  what would be the benefit of a `` uk solution '' a la norway & switzerland ? 
  you might like this : eu commision in uk has a blog where they debunk false claims about eu in british media : http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/blog/index_en.htm, 
   you then revisit another self-told lie that even those promoting leaving the eu do n't argue . 
  nobody is arguing for turning our backs on eu trade . 
  many non-hardline people in uk want to stay in the free-trade/common market aspect of the eu , which is just what you 've suggested . 
  however is that even on the cards ? 
  is anyone offering the uk a `` half membership '' where they are in common market , but do n't have to abide by ( say ) social or justice laws . 
  i thought it was `` referendum on eu membership '' ? 
  which implies all in or all out ? 
  if there was a choice of uk stays in eu ( status quo ) , or uk leaving eu and common market and free trade , what would you want ? 
   a third of our business dealing are with europe , and not just financial transactions , exports are a large part of this third ? 
  i heard half ... wonder what the real number is . 
   we still have people in this country that really believe the eu was going to ban our bendy cucumbers . 
  i 've heard some people ( in uk ) think the eu was going to force uk to change the name of sausages and were planning on bringing in a eurosausage . 
  that was a plot of yes , prime minister . 
  * ssssh * the motivation for some is n't to stop nice white women having babies , it 's to keep out the darkies . 
   do you really want a goverment like that to join europe ? 
  which creates lies/propaganda to cover things up ? 
  pfft , the uk sexed up a report so they could invade other countries . 
  we 've cross the rubicon on the whole `` governments lying '' thing . 
   well then the country 's name is absolutely no basis to reject their application . 
  this is politics we 're talking about !, 
  what plague ? 
  afair the anglo saxon settlements were around 500 ce ? 
  the payment part is to probably count the old practice of hiring a few thousand people ( or pirates ) to go invading and plundering . 
  this was before modern fulltime paid armies . 
  the main reason is because there 's an irish company `` facebook ireland ltd. '' , which is obviously subject to eu law . 
  they almost did , but voted against it . 
  ireland had similar referenda in the 50s and 60s ( but to switch from pr to the uk first-past-the-post system ) . 
  both times rejected . 
  talk to your mp, 
  agreed , they are playing silly party politics , just voting against it to damage their political opponents . 
  in usa , `` socialist '' is an insult . 
   `` leveller , '' which was essentially an 18th-century word for a socialist .
