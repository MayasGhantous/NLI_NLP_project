  but you have to use condoms every time . 
  but you only need an abortion when you get pregnant , which does n't happen every time you have sex . 
  hey , i did n't say it was a * good * idea , or necessarily the right answer . 
  just what might be running through people 's head . 
  the far right in ireland ( youth defence et al ) , and all their american far right backers, 
  i dunno , they show decent enough figures for ireland , and the far right loves to pretend ireland is great & anti-abortion . 
  if they were gon na fudge it , they could claim ireland has no abortions . 
  cost ? 
  ireland has more restrictive abortion laws than poland . 
  most irish abortions happen in uk . 
  so they are clearly taking `` foreign abortions '' into account . 
  because people think `` gay '' = `` feminine '' and `` gay '' = `` does what women do '' . 
  some people can get their head around * gay * men doing ` women 's work ' ( looking after children ) , but think that * straight * men would n't want to do ` women 's work ' . 
  it 's restrictive gender roles, 
  ( irish ) ceo of my company travelled to stockholm and thought there were loads of gay men had adopted children . 
  about 1/4 of us employees get no paid time off . 
  there is no legal requirement to holidays in the usa ( at least federally afaik ), 
  if hours worked was a good metric , then the usa would be miles ahead of the eu, 
   / r/bitcoin would have loved 1840s ireland . 
  did you know some libertains think ireland pre-1500s was a libertarian/anarchistic paradise ? 
  it 's weird . 
  eh , they can keep it . 
  / famine queen can stay with the pommies, 
  heh , reminds me of the [ statue of queen victoria ] ( http://www.insidehistory.com.au/2013/07/statue-of-queen-victoria/ ) that used to be outside the ( what is now ) the irish parliament building . 
  after independence it was taken down . 
  a few decades later , it was rediscovered in a shed and `` loaned '' to the australians . 
  cultural catholic . 
  people who want to get married in a church , but think condoms , divorce and gay marriage are ok , do n't go to mass at all , could mark themselves down as catholic . 
  i wonder if it 's because in some regions religion is tied to ethnicity . 
  here in ireland , traditional , to be irish meant to be catholic . 
  protestant meant english , and foreign . 
  hence many people in ireland will claim to be catholic , because they consider themselves to be irish . 
  wonder if something similar is going on in poland . 
   this uprising is like a war of independence after independence had technically already been achieved . 
  it 's quite common for there to be more than one uprising type thing after `` independence '' / `` the revolution '', 
   edit : why is the text available only in english ? 
  did the organisers put no thought in this ? 
  whom do i have to contact about translating this to german ? 
  i think it 's cause the proposers only made it in english . 
  you should talk to the proposers : bendix.fesefeldt@sciencespo.fr, pierre.balas@sciencespo.fr, 
  a lot of eu stats stuff is at the nuts3 level , which is just so big . 
  in the usa , they have county level stats and can do lots of more interesting maps . 
  wish we had that, 
  i suppose it depends on what you 're asking . 
  if your asking if scotland could just print `` scottish pounds '' that look different and all that , then that 's fine and legal . 
  if the scottish government were to try to print money and claim it 's gbp and exactly the same as that , then that 's a different money , and like i said , probably illegal . 
  technically ? 
  yes . 
  but they 'd be counterfeit notes . 
  you would n't be able to legeally use them in ruk , you would n't be able to use them in beauroi de change 's what they could do is sell something they have ( e.g. 
  oil ) to a uk company/government in exchange for cases full of gbp , and then the government just stocks atms with them, 
  state pensions are usually paid by currently working people . 
  probably makes more sense to read it as eu, 
  unless they re-ran the referendum . 
  it 's happened in ireland a few times when ~ ~ we voted the wrong way ~ ~ when people did n't understand the issues . 
   with referenda not being legally binding in the uk they could make the referendum legally binding if they wanted to , there is no legal reason a referendum could n't be binding . 
  that 's what happened with the [ av referendum of 2011 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_alternative_vote_referendum,_2011 ) . 
   well , i 'd say they 're capitalizing on public ignorance about the scope of the law . 
  no , the vast major of the population want a more liberal abortion law . 
  and many people have access to a liberal abortion law by travelling to england . 
  ireland 's abortion rates are not too far off eu average . 
  it 's just a very loud minority , and politicians who do n't want to take a stand , that meant the current situation continued till people started openly dying . 
   given the media shitstorm after savita i would n't be surprised if a lot of people would think abortion was legal now . 
  technically abortion is legal in some situations now . 
  it is legal to intentially end a pregnancy , in some restricted cases . 
  the anti abortion crowd keep playing word games with the word abortion , claiming that the think abortion should be illegal all the time , and pretending that ending a pregnancy to save a woman 's life does n't count as abortion . 
   the worst thing that is likely to happen is that we are forced to join the euro . 
  well since scottish notes are different from the notes used in england , forced to switch to the euro wont make things too hard , since you still have to change your money . 
  however , i wonder about schengen . 
  if scotland would have to join that , then they 'd have to put a border control up at the border , no ? 
  smaller countries have proportionally more meps per capita than larger ones . 
  otherwise they would be reluctant to join the eu , since they would be much more swamped andbpowerlessy, 
   their main points are opposition to liberalization of abortion rules just to point out , the law they objected to made abortion legal if it would save the life of the woman ( incl if she was suicidal ) . 
  before this there was no clear law , making it doubtful whether a woman could have an abortion at all . 
  this is one of the reasons savita halapanavar died . 
  the law they objected to is probably one of the most restrictive and illiberal abortion laws in europe . 
  this splinter group are crazy . 
   southern ireland/eire you mean , but yes , they boycotted it because they knew that only 5 % would have voted to join eire . 
  nope . 
  the offical name of the country is ireland . 
  `` eire '' is a misspelling of the irish language version of the word ireland , and is only really used in the uk . 
  there is no country ( and in effect no country ever ) called `` southern ireland '' . 
  ireland is also the name of the geographic island , which includes the northern ireland and the country of ireland . 
  yes it is confusiong . 
  my theory is that right wing nutters are attracted to ukip and hence run under it 's banner . 
  it 's like how many of their canidates/members are racist . 
  it 's because racists are attracted to the party . 
  because it 's a racist party , . 
  yeah * total coincidence * that there are so many cranks in ukip . 
  yup . 
  co-incidence . 
  similar thing happened in [ northern ireland in 1973 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_ireland_sovereignty_referendum,_1973 ) . 
  there was a referendum to stay in uk or join ireland , but the nationalists/pro-join-ireland - side boycotted it . 
  yep , you should negotiate . 
  the scottish nationalists did n't get everything they wanted with the referendum result . 
  a better referendum for them would be a 2 question : `` should scotland be independent ? '', 
  and then `` if not , should the scottish parliament have more power ? '' . 
  if 50.0001 % vote for independence , then they can get indepenence . 
  if 49 % vote for independence , then it 's highly likely that the majority would have voted for `` more power '' , so the scottish parliament would have been able to get full power over ( say ) taxiation . 
  either way the scottish politicians would have won .
