  i 'm reading that article and i ca n't really follow you ... why ca n't there be a referendum ? 
  can you eli5 ? 
  to expand , in ireland only the ruling government can propose and hold a referendum . 
  there is no way for the people to force there to be a referendum . 
  the [ labour government had a referendum on whether to leave the eec ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_european_communities_membership_referendum,_1975 ) ( which became the eu ) in 1975 . 
  the conservative party had brought uk in in 1973 . 
  the people voted to stay in . 
  how times have changed . 
   other parts of the uk have had regional specific referenda . 
  like for setting up devolved parliament . 
  i 'm irish . 
  i can understand my own language ( english ) perfectly well . 
  even irish the language has n't worked in education . 
  eurovision has always been , well , special . 
  jedward again !, 
   well how do you celebrate halloween in dublin ? 
  is it different from how they do it in america ? 
  i 'm unsure how it 's done in usa . 
  here in ireland , they 'll be a lot of bonfires and illegal fireworks going off . 
  children will dress up in costumes ( alas getting less scary and more fancy dress ), 
   whether or not it * was * does n't change it * is * . 
  it was european but now it feels very american . 
  maybe in your country , certainly not here in ireland . 
  here it still feels irish, 
  halloween has been celebrated in ireland for a long long time . 
  it 's only recently i learned that , in england , it 's viewed as a recent american import . 
  halloween * is * a european holiday . 
  exactly . 
  you can conscienceously object to it . 
  just write a resignation letter . 
   it would n't be the preferred term though . 
  the bbc and uk government frequently use the following preferred terms to refer to the mini state : er , no . 
  you have 1 bbc link , 1 document form 1902 ( to back up `` southern ireland '' ) , and a community support group for the north east of scotland for `` eire '' . 
  ( here 's a [ bbc link saying `` offical name : ireland '' ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17478647 ) , [ bbc country overview says ireland ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17473476 ) . 
  [ the guardian style guide says `` ireland , irish republic , not \u00c9ire or ` southern ireland ' '' ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/styleguide/i ) yes , i know `` republic of ireland '' ( or to use the british syntax : `` irish republic '' ) is good for * disambiguation * , and yes , we use it in ireland . 
  but the common , default term , is `` ireland '' . 
   very rarely you will hear someone say ` ireland ' to refer to the state - it always means the island . 
  factually incorrect . 
  complete nonsense . 
  come to ireland . 
  you 'll hear people use the term `` ireland '' . 
  look at any official/governmental body anywhere , it 'll say `` ireland '' examples : * [ european union list of member states says `` ireland '' ( it says `` czech republic '' ) ] ( http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/ ) * [ un member countries says `` ireland '' ] ( http://www.un.org/en/members/ ) * [ uk foreign office travel advice says `` ireland '' ] ( https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ireland ) * [ uk foreign office when talking about uk/ireland relations uses the term `` ireland '' all over the place , and no-where uses any of your terms ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/world/ireland ) * [ uk embassy in `` ireland '' ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-dublin ), 
  here here . 
  we need more pan-european institutions . 
  take power away from the nation-states, 
  yes , we 're getting very into the semantics and pedantics here . 
  `` ireland '' means 2 things , the geographic island of ireland , and also a country that is a memberstate of the eu , un , etc. 
  `` republic of ireland '' and `` island of ireland '' are 2 common terms used to be unambiguous here , but the offical name of the country is `` ireland '' ( not `` republic of ireland '' ) , so it is correct to say `` ireland left the uk '' . 
  you 'd be suprised at some of the weird misconceptions that some people from the new world can have . 
  yeah , it 's a misleading chart when it comes to ireland . 
   that 's like saying `` outside us and california '' . 
  ireland is in uk . 
  er , no it is n't . 
  ireland left the uk in 1922 and is currently a separate country . 
  i 'm totally behind the junior doctors ( as they are called ) with this . 
  one of the union 's demands is that no shift should last more than 24 hours . 
  the ** union 's demands ** are for a max 24 hour shift !!, 
  that 's illegal , and also too long . 
  nope . 
  one of their demands `` comply with the law '', 
  do you have any historical connection to europe ? 
  ireland gives ( irish ) citizenship to anyone who 's grandparent was an irish citizen . 
  then you can live and work in the eu all you want . 
  might make visa issues easier . 
  what sort of bikes ? 
  motorbikes ? 
  or pedal bikes ? 
  broadly yes . 
  however people/organisations/media / politicians use the census as if it 's a recording of permanent residents . 
   that is not +4 m but it could be at least 500k-1m over the real number . 
  but that 's a totally different statement . 
  15 \u2192 20 % over is totally different form 100 % over . 
  still loads of atm machines here in ireland ca n't take them . 
  \u2639 fecking national train network atms did n't take them when they were released . 
   i see we 're not really that different from all other europeans who are supposed to be somehow be ahead of us as a society . 
  oh yeah , there 's loads of open racism & discrimination from various `` western european '' or `` advanced '' countries . 
  they should admit they are still kinda racist . 
  even if it did happen , it 's democracy at work in ruk !, 
  then stop voting for them !, 
  yeah , i was talking about what the law says ( which is a `` yes and no '' ) . 
  but in practice there * are * cases where irish hospitals do n't do abortions . 
  just look at savita . 
  to mess up the english . 
  yes , i 'm an old fashioned tribalist sometimes . 
  that 's probably what they are counting . 
   some place aborts 87.5 % of their babies ? 
  i really do n't believe your data , op . 
  maybe this is likelihood of abortion over a lifetime ? 
  if people do n't use contraception , they sometimes use abortion . 
  man , poland 's abortion laws are so much more liberal than ireland ... we only allow it `` pregnancy endangers the life '' :(, 
  you should also look at contraceptive use . 
  usually abortion rates fall when contraception is used more . 
   do we have any references for this graph so we can see who supplied these figures ? 
  there are ~ 70,000 births per year in ireland ( look at cso ) . 
  there are ~ 5,000 abortions of irish pregnancies in uk&nl . 
  there 's your 7 % . 
   the figure must include irish women who have had a termination outside the state . 
  yes that 's what the 5 \u2192 8 % comes from . 
   abortions are , and always were , available in life threatening scenarios in ireland . 
  yes and no .
