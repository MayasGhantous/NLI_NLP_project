  yes , the constitution and courts , said that abortion is legal to save a woman 's life . 
  but no , because the only law on abortion before then said it was illegal in all cases regardless . 
  when a pregnant woman is in medical sitution , it was not legally clear when an abortion could be given . 
  get it wrong and the doctor would be struck off the regisiter and possible sentanced to life in prison . 
   the recent change in legislation clarified this position by making the law match the constitution . 
   it 's possible that the 5 % are legally allowed abortions for medical reasons though . 
  nope . 
  up until recently there was no law that said what `` life threatening situtation '' was , and [ sometimes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_of_savita_halappanavar ) they wait too long before doing anything . 
  nb : abortion to save your life is legal , abortion to save your health is not . 
  got a medical problem which means continuing the pregnancy will severly hamper your health , but not kill you ? 
  no abortion ( unless you go to the uk ) . 
   now i 'm really curious how they gathered the data . 
  the nhs collects figures on how many people get an abortion and give an address in ireland . 
   since it 's completely illegal to have an abortion there afaik i 'm guessing that 's all horrendous back-alley affairs . 
  or am i missing something ? 
  nope . 
  the uk . 
  there is a constitutional ban on abortion , and also a constitutional right to travel abroad for abortion . 
  so people go to the uk . 
   just use contraception , what the hell !, 
  is n't that easier ? 
  that can be expensive . 
  expensive contraception . 
  the police can and do take children off people and would have do medical checks on them . 
  is there any quote of a police officer supporting this claim ? 
  i 've never heard of them drugging babies/toddlers with vodka or heroin . 
  it 's * not * well known . 
  if it 's so common , then there should be a good source . 
  provide one or shut up . 
   when i posted it to srs it was on 117 points ( you can see in the title , there 's also a chart of points/vote ) . 
  now that comment is up to 161 points !, 
  and now it 's up to 191 points !, 
  oh noes the downvote brigade will see post and , er , double the points ? 
  and refering to them as a disease that we must fight off will help how ? 
   yeah the srs no one goes too . 
  oh really ? 
  / r/shitredditsays has more subscribers than / r/europe . 
  i guess no-one goes to / r/europe !, 
  yes they do . 
  there 's a whole subreddit of srs to do with discussion ( / r/srsdiscussion ) . 
  many subreddits have rules and moderators ( e.g. 
   those german residents or the roma residents ? 
  pedantically , if you live in germany you 're a `` german resident '' . 
  though i presume you are refereing to the ethnicity of the resident of the accomodation , as opposed to in which nation the person is resident . 
   and what 's a left wing extremist in germany ? 
  or how is that defined ? 
  i presume far left , socialist / anarchist . 
  yep , [ it 's up on shit reddit says ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/shitredditsays/comments/1lbwat/on_roma_people_poverty_is_not_the_problem_their/ ), 
   you did not add anything to the discussion , just insulted him . 
  so `` insulting speech '' is n't protected speech ? 
  interesting interpretion . 
   you are knowingly inviting a downvote brigade here . 
  y' know , when i posted it to srs it was on 117 points ( you can see [ in the title ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/shitredditsays/comments/1lbwat/on_roma_people_poverty_is_not_the_problem_their/ ) , there 's also a [ chart of points/vote ] ( http://74.207.230.31/srscharts/#cbxk641 ) ) . 
  now that comment is up to 161 points !, 
  either ( a ) srs is a down vote brigade that is n't very successful or ( b ) srs is n't a downvote brigade . 
  either ( a ) nothing to worry about or ( b ) nothing to worry about . 
  so why get worried ? 
   srs does n't really care about rules . 
  y' know , people often complain about srs and wo n't post on it , by claiming that they are anal retentive about lots of strict rules and ban people all the time . 
  but you 've just said srs does n't care about rules !, 
  so glad you cleared up that about srs . 
  that post * was * dehumanizing !, 
  it talked about roma people as if they were a disease !, 
  and the rwandan genocide . 
   conform to the morals and values of the society and the government that represents said society but who decides that ? 
  for example , do you have to be christian ? 
  well , uk in 1920 ( i.e. 
  pre irish secession ) had a sizable irish ethnic minority , but there was n't much voter supression . 
  catholics were banned from being in parliament for a while , but that was repealed in 1830s , well before the usa abolished slavery and * well * before the usa had equal voting rights . 
  i 'm calling bullshit on that . 
  you 're `` source '' is what looks like a poorly worded and grammatically incorrect blog post . 
  you 'll really need to do better than for such a serious claim to be taken more seriously . 
  what about my free speech rights ? 
  ah depends what you mean , by `` settled '' . 
  if you mean `` settled in one place '' , then yes there is a large percentage of `` travellers '' who live in houses , and have `` settled '' into houses . 
  if you mean `` are now a member of the settled community as opposed to the travelling community '' , then no , there are still a lot of people who do n't see them as `` members of the settled community '' . 
  so , er , was / u/tparau talking nonsense then ? 
  you already allow all the irish travellers to enter and live there . 
  has the uk imploded since then ? 
  not all racist places/societies are racist the same way . 
  for example , i do n't think any racist european countries treated black people as badly as the usa did 80 years ago ... 
  happens in lots of countries . 
  irish people were treated badly in ( say ) uk , and then treat migrants to ireland badly . 
  some people never learn . 
  there is lots of racism in western europe . 
  to think western europe is not racist is insane . 
  uk & ireland have been racist to their own nomadic ethnic mintory for generations . 
  read eu law banning racism . 
  it * always * talks about `` racial or ethnic discrimination '' or `` race/ethnicity '' . 
  in europe discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity * is * racism !, 
  yeah , americans have a weird very ` skin-colour ' based view of race and racism , which is a gross simplification about the european ethnic based discrimination and racism . 
  but that is a racist thing to say ? 
   it 's something that has n't existed here since early medieval times maybe in the netherlands . 
  ireland & britain have an itinerant nomand minority and have had for a while ( travellers ), 
  what a racist , disgusting post of bile . 
  this language of infection and pests is straight out of `` how to start a genocide '' , and reminds me of the rwanda genocide where tutsi were called `` cockroaches '' . 
  what 's next , should we ` racially cleanse ' europe of the infection ? 
  shame on you . 
  b. johnson means white commonwealth countries . 
  successful colonies .
