  the following things from ft. ted are real : the bishop with the son ( oooh big scandal in the early 1990s before we realised the priests were raping all those kids ) , the dancing priest ( he was on stage with the pope ( and also had a kid ) ) , etc. 
  and it 's the best thing ever . 
  you made a mistake with the description though . 
  it 's really an example of current european geopolitics and national snubs . 
  there 's a bit of singing at the start . 
  it is almost a national religion in ireland . 
  peep show does n't really have a lot of story arcs . 
  there is a lot of stand alone-ness . 
  it is better to watch it through though . 
  eu directives mean that you are entitled to 4 weeks off . 
  so if you only work 20 hrs per week , then you 'll get on average 10 days off . 
  you have to be able to take 4 weeks paid time off . 
  employers can not avoid it by having employees on some weird half time . 
  though they do try . 
  additionally , eu employment law has things us does n't . 
  nationwide laws against discriminating based on gender , sexuality , religion , race/ethnicity , etc. 
  just about all eu countries have paid maternity leave . 
  `` at will '' employment is illegal . 
  you can not be fired for `` no reason '' . 
   so , should african countries also considerate this , or only european countries ? 
  racism ( & other forms of unfair exclusion ) occur all over the place . 
  all societies need to be aware of it . 
  that is a misleading and incorrect gross simplification of what i said . 
  i said that it 's * complicated * . 
  it 's entirely possible for white people to be racist against white people for example . 
  northern ireland is an example . 
  a `` dictionary argument '' !, 
  sorry that 's not a valid counter-point . 
  ( a ) english does not have a standardisation body , so dictianary.com does not decide what a word does or does n't mean . 
  ( b ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racism#definitions here 's some more definitions . 
   but a `` rich black man '' would have more benefits than a `` rich white man '' in african countries , i can assure that as i live in one . 
  i do n't doubt you . 
  i 'm white and have been to african countries , i know what it 's like when you stand out like that . 
  in my original comment i was thinking of usa/eu , hence my example of black & white people . 
  racism and intolerance can exist in many places . 
  guess what , human society is complex !, 
   why should n't there be an institutionalized power structure among races ? 
  i believe all people are born equal . 
  additionally , whenever there has been insititualized power structures , it 's resulted in bad things . 
   france owes nothing to any non-french peoples how do you defined `` non-french '' people ? 
  do black people count ? 
  what about french citizens who have black skin ? 
  does n't france owe french citizens equality ? 
  does the uk government owe ethnic irish people born , living & working in uk equlaity ? 
  the eu legal minimum is 4 weeks ( 20 days ) paid time off per year ( european working time directive ) . 
  many ( all ? ), 
  countries have public holidays that you get off aswell ( ireland gives 9 extra days ) . 
  however some countries give * more * than the 20 days . 
  germany gives 30 days i think . 
  this already happened . 
  the uk vetoed the fiscal compact ( about a year ago ) . 
  it went ahead anyway ( just through a different route ) . 
   the ones that matter considering that 's where the bank is located . 
  the swiss bank might have a us corportation in the usa to do business in the usa . 
   perhaps european nations should start suing u.s. companies for their horrible environmental standards , that after all does affect the rest of the world . 
  or sue them for not giving their employees enough paid holidays under the european working time directive . 
  not just schengen . 
  schengen means passport-less entry . 
  i 'm talking about visa requirements for eu people . 
  the uk is not in schengen , but people from poland can live and work in uk without a visa ( cause of eu ) . 
  norway likewise allows people from eu & eea to live and work there without needing a visa or permit . 
  they have to , that 's part of the eea rules . 
  if the uk became like norway ( i.e. 
  changed from eu member to eea member ) , then everyone in the eu & eea would be allowed to live and work in the uk without needing a visa . 
  this is what a `` trade deal like norway '' means !, 
  switzerland had to allow people from romania & bulgaria ( new eu members ) live and work there a few years ago because they were new eu members . 
  happening a lot in ireland ( which has a long history of emmigration ) . 
  though it 's often young people moving to uk , australia , etc. 
   it wo n't be as disastrous as many are claiming . 
  we could negotiate a trade deal such as norway has for example . 
  norway has to implement many eu laws on the single market , like labour & free movement of people . 
  seems like the uk gains very little . 
  having an eu negotiating team is great , it means one approaches the table with a much stronger hand . 
  `` wan na trade with 500 million people ? '', 
  i disagree . 
  this `` it makes you / your cause stronger '' argument is used to justify inaction on manga issues , such as tackling school bullying . 
  you are also ignoring the pain of the directly affected family . 
  they must suffer , seeing that at their loved one 's funeral . 
  why should we put them through that so more people can flock to the pro-equality cause ? 
  additionally if your `` bad tthings cause people to fight them '' reason is worth it for anti gay rhetoric at funerals , surely we should install a mad dictator every generation ? 
  get a modern day hitler for a few years time kill a lot of people ? 
  surely that 'd make people support democracy ? 
  no , that 's silly , and so is the idea that we should let the wbc protest funerals to help gay rights . 
  do n't all countries ban some political parties ? 
  i think nelson mandela 's party was illegal for a long while in usa . 
  it 's not all or nothing . 
  we can have shades of grey . 
  we * can * draw a line . 
  this us what laws do , this is what legislators do , they draw lines and make laws . 
  the meme that `` we either let them all exist or we ban them all , there can be no middle ground '' is nonsense . 
  we coold easily make a law saying `` it 's ok to block some speech that is designed to be disrespectful of the recently deceased around their funeral and can easily be seen by their grieving family '', 
  sure you do . 
  never been to a catholic country , have you ? 
   you will never see catholics mass-praying in streets , while stopping all traffic in europe http://www.thejournal.ie/pro-life-vigil-dublin-701791-dec2012/ got citations of muslims doing these things , bar that photo ? 
  to give some samples of catholics doing bad things : [ a woman in ireland was denied a life saving ( and probably legal ) abortion in an irish state funded hospital claiming ` this is a catholic country ' ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2012/1114/1224326575203.html ) , [ a polish teenager who was trying to get an abortion after being raped had to see a priest ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20143558 ) * all * religious extremism & hatred ( of all kinds ) is bad . 
  it 's not just some muslims and some christians . 
  cause the * later * half of the 20th century were the undemocratic period of 20th century germany < / sarcasm , 
   catholicism already grew out of inquisitions and religion extremism in 1600-1700 's nope , much later than that . 
  as late as the 1860s the roman catholic church & pope was claiming that people should n't have freedom of religion and that religious law should trump civil law ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quanta_cura and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syllabus_of_errors ) . 
  additionally the roman catholic church has fought divorce , contraception , pornography and homosexuality throughout the 20th century .
