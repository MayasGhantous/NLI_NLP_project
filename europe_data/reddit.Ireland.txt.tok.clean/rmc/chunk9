  how is the roman catholic church different from a muslim ` church ' ? 
   as long as you are not threatening people or continually harrassing them , i think it should all be allowed . 
  the us seems to almost have the right balance . 
  i disagree . 
  the usa goes too far . 
  for example , the westboro baptist church is legally allowed to hold protests outside funerals saying ( more or less ) `` your gay son deserved to die '' , to ban them would limit their free speech right . 
  i think it is cruel that this is legal . 
  i think it is better that their free speech rights in the case is limited against the family grieving . 
  the pendulum goes too far in the `` free speech above all else '' . 
  there are countries that have had anti-hate-speech laws for decades ( e.g. 
  uk since mid 1980s ) . 
  do you think the uk is now a `` sham democracy '' ? 
  all countries with real `` right to free speech '' limit speech . 
  many countries are ok with limiting free speech for things like libel , `` fire in a crowded theatre '' example , or in witness protection programmes . 
  many eu countries limit free speech for data protection reasons . 
  many countries limit free speech for hate speech type laws . 
  there is many times a trade off . 
  do we limit person a 's right to free speech or do we limit person b 's right to y. 
  in the case of witness protection , the y is `` right to life and not be shot by mobsters '' . 
  in the case of data protection , y is `` right to privacy '' . 
  for hate speech , the y is `` right to live your life ( e.g. 
  be an open gay man ) without risk of being killed or assaulted '' . 
  there is not one approach that fits every case . 
  some cases ( e.g. 
  witness protection ) , are very serious , so the limits on free speech are more severe . 
  some ( e.g. 
  hate speech ) can be more general , so the approach & penalties where you draw the line are different . 
  * ( even reddit with it 's very liberal ` free speech ' rules , goes further than usa and bans things that are protected speech in usa ( doxxing ) ) *, 
  got a citation/source/example ? 
  there have literally been wars fought over that . 
  europe is mostly secular now . 
  there 'd be lots of people left . 
  well , it 's part of my identity . 
  a trans-national identity . 
  so ... like europe 100 years ago ? 
  be nice !, 
   most europeans like americans just fine . 
  they just do n't like assholes , just like americans do n't like europeans who are assholes . 
  we 're not like two completely different people , when you get right down to it . 
  exactly . 
  acknowlege that each country is different , do n't complain that everything is better than the usa , or that everwhere should do things the same was as the usa and you 'll be fine . 
  yep , northern irish people can get an irish passport ( if they want ) and get free education in scotland . 
  it 's really pissed off the unionists who do n't want to claim irish citizenship . 
  the expensive parts of europe are scandanavia & switzerland . 
  the cheap parts are out east , the new accession states , former communist countries etc, 
   i did a post-grad course in 2006 in one of the shitties colleges of the uk ( wolverhampton ) and there were two prices , one for eu citizens , one for outside the eu , the second being a lot more expensive . 
  another data point : this is similar to irish universities . 
  maybe $ 15k for non-eu fees ? 
  not really at the same rate as the catholics in the uk . 
  yes they did . 
  the life of brian was banned in several countries and i 've heard the actors recieved death threats . 
  hardly . 
  contemporary christianity is very dangerous and is currently fighting gay rights all over europe . 
   then , they are n't christian . 
  you ( or any religion ) do not get to define what `` christian '' means . 
  catholics do n't follow the bible literally . 
  does n't mean they are n't christians . 
  christians themselves ca n't really agree on what is `` christian '', 
  so when islam changes to be more like christianity , it 'll be ok ? 
   maybe because it 's fucked up ideology that is contrary to democracy ? 
  like catholicism ? 
  the pope denounced democracy 150 years ago ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quanta_cura ), 
  the biggest problem with religionous people in europe was from christians . 
  how come no-one suggests sending them back where they come from ? 
  the uk survived and got an empire even though it had way more catholics then that it has muslims now . 
  what makes you think this is different ? 
  it would be cool if you could have more than one flag . 
  i 'd like to have an eu , irish and lgbt flag . 
   well , you ca n't have all flags in the world available . 
  why not ? 
  let 's start with every country . 
  well when i talk about a pan european phone network , i mostly mean roaming charges only not customer service . 
  as an irish person , i can tell you that i 'd be quite surprised if you can get any customer service for your phone in the irish language . 
   i do n't see cellphone providers voluntarily wanting to give up the profit that comes with charging us extra for european calls . 
  exactly , they wo n't give it up . 
  so we 'll have to make it law . 
  eu already tackles this , there are maximum prices eu phone companies can charge customers who roam within the eu ( http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/roaming/tariffs/index_en.htm ) . 
  i hope the law will eventually converge down to `` maximum extra roaming rate is 0 '' /, 
  the irish government is fully supporting austerity for ireland , you wo n't see any change on the european front . 
  i ca n't wait till the eu abolished roaming rates across all of the eu . 
  we 're supposed to have a common market , right ? 
   i only went by ` youth defences ' website put this into google `` site : youthdefence.ie homosexual '' , you 'll find some anti-gay stuff there . 
  for example , here 's ( their magazine from 2008 ) [ www.youthdefence.ie/am_cms_media/solas-july-2008.pdf]:  that message got increasingly strident when it came to homosexual behaviour . 
  the lifestyle of homosexuals , we were informed , was strictly a private matter , and if we found the need for lewd public displays distasteful , we should keep quiet since to utter a word in dissent was tantamount to the new ` crime ' of homophobia . 
   ...  they say that children reared in homosexual households are more likely to experience sexual confusion , practice homosexual behaviour , and engage in sexual experimentation . 
  oh no , it 'll turn kids gay and it 's unnatural and horrible and fake !!, 
  youth defence are bigots and homophobes . 
   hopefully the fines they have to pay stop them putting up anti-gay and pro-choice posters all over ireland possible , but unlikely . 
  they have been engaged in semi-illegal activities before ( the irish family planning association had to get injunction barring orders against youth defence for years ( http://www.independent.ie/national-news/court-lifts-injunction-imposed-after-youth-defence-protest-355101.html ) ) . 
  it did n't stop them breaking the law in the last few weeks again . 
   youth defence is pro-life not anti gay as far as i 'm aware oh their anti-gay alright . 
  their magazine has had anti-gay-marriage articles  one of the high ranking members of this very provocative and secret organisation is niamh ui bhriain . 
  in a section of youth defence ` s magazine ` solas ` ( yes they can afford to publish a magazine with all their funds ) ms bhriain stated that people should oppose marriage equality and civil partnership because it `` endangers the children of the state and undermines their safety '' and that it does not allow for '' conscientious objection for anyone with a moral obligation `` . 
  * http://davidhealy1.wordpress.com/2012/07/03/all-it-takes-for-evil-to-prosper-is-for-good-men-to-do-nothing-78/ * http://www.broadsheet.ie/2012/07/02/youth-defence-on-gay-equality/ youth defence is one of a small number of catholic lobby groups based in the same office in capel street , and with the same directors , and using the same facilites . 
  some of the others are the life institute , mother and child campaign , etc. 
  they are all opposed to same sex marriage . 
  * http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/mother-and-child-campaign-opposes-adoption-by-gay-couples-256352.html  what do you mean taught about ` gay sex ' ? 
  they 're already taught about sex in general not just straight sex ( i got taught both even in a catholic school ) it 's a common anti-gay propaganda to claim that children will be converted to gayness if we allow any gay rights and oh wo n't someone think of the children . 
  for example , during the california referendum ( `` prop 8 '' ) , `` they 'll teach your kids to be gay !!!, 
  ! 1one '' was used to claim you should vote against same sex marriage ( example : http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/19/local/me-gayschools19 ( the prop8 stuff is confusing , because `` yes '' meant `` yes , ban same sex marriage '' , and `` no '' meant `` no , do n't ban same sex marriage '' ) .
