  remember how the 2012 general election everybody was suddenly going to vote for lib dems , yeah how did that end up . 
  i was under the impresion that schengen cloud was just buzzwords . 
  i 'd be really surprised if they wired up only the shengen area , and the shitstorm that we brits would throw if our taxes paid for it . 
  can england please not put the man in charge that wants to sell me ... 
  when you want to be high king , race the length of the island and when you 're about to lose chop your hand off and throw it over the finishing line . 
  ... some of those dots are in america ... 
  he 's even in the credits ... 
  ... i can see the language gap in belgium ... 
  strange ... 
  this is the best thing i have ever seen . 
  never have i been glad to live in northern ireland . 
  i 've been thinking about a main-land move for awhile now . 
  probably gon na wait a while . 
  morocco claims it 's historically part of greater morocco . 
  there are about 500,000 people living there , almost exclusively along the coast . 
  the region was supposed to be jointly governed by morocco and mauritania after spain 's decolonization , but they went to a brief war , a complete independence government went into exile in algeria . 
  i do n't think anyone else actually supports morocco 's claims officially . 
  but morocco has been trying for years to get some form of bilateral negotiations , but algeria ( who funds the independence movement and provides weapons etc ) refuses . 
  in terms of natural resources , mostly fish and phosphate mining , nothing amazing , there is speculated gas or oil off shore but it would cost an insurmountable amount of money to actually get to in . 
  morocco has been pushing for this for decades . 
  the western sahara issue makes them unpopular in the african union , the magreb union is a joke , where else were they going to turn ? 
  we 're morocco 's largest trading partner and they directly boarder spain , so boarder controls must be maintained , building the country up is the best way to do it . 
  besides building a friendly southern solar battery can only be a good thing . 
   we in the uk deal with it by passively aggressively call ireland `` the republic of ireland '' all the time , and i think the greeks could simply do the same . 
  or we cold all go '' best korea '' northern ireland , best ireland , only ireland . 
  if greece does this with macedon , then eventually everyone will treat it as a joke an nobody will care anymore . 
  yous still lost though did n't ya ? 
  we 're still here on the same damn island . 
  it was already signed into law but delayed for the war . 
  it was supposed to go live in november 1914 . 
  because money and business tend to prioritize them . 
  yeah look at that building with no roof , exposed concrete blocks , and wooden glass , that people obviously live in ... 
  i saw this a couple of days ago [ only someone lay baba yetu over it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zorzpe2pl40 ) heavily edited down of course . 
  the part when the map was ripped between there people was the dividing of poland between germany , austria and russia . 
  it 's why the man then hits the ground and causes another `` rise '' like at the video 's start , rebirth of a country and all that . 
  - it is not ok to suggest that members of different cultures or races are incapable of cohabiting . 
  this article suggests that the british public disagree with this rule . 
  he 's stated a fact . 
  nope usually john bull is accredited . 
  the only older anthems are the spanish and dutch anthems . 
  liechenstein still uses the same tune . 
  and in the past was used by germany , russia , and the kingdom of hawaii . 
  sweden and norway have also used the melody for royal anthems . 
   if it was that easy then i 'd probably pay . 
  but then again usually there 's always some bullshit : either ads , or you need some obscure browser plugin , you ca n't stream it from your tablet , etc. 
  it 's the bbc thought the worst you would have to doo is install ad block . 
   torrent many times is more convenient : i go to my favorite torrent aggregator site , click on ` download torrent file ' and that 's it . 
  my client automatically begins downloading once it finds a new . torrent file . 
  5 minutes later i can watch . 
  the problem with this in this scenario is that the number of people torrenting will drop significantly , so your download will take longer . 
   i mean i pay for netflix but the hassle of changing my proxy settings to watch some geoblocked show is just more work than simply torrenting it . 
  again in this scenario there are no blocks so no need to bother with a proxy at all . 
  and i could get rte in wales . 
  well considering how many people like paradox games you 'd think that / r/europegames would be a thing . 
  tell me about it ... 
  italy is in europe ... 
  i 'm really glad it has switzerland because that gap would drive me insane . 
  i laughted . 
  i feel like i just de-aged 10 years . 
  the only one i can think off is muff, 
  it 's going to be brillent . 
  [ i just going to need more booze than ever ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6r1tuhl1cq ) * edit shit they might find out we invited australia . 
  i literally had to look at it for a solid minute before i got it . 
  i feel so stupid . 
  who is we ? 
  you have no flair . 
  i using the uk chart . 
  the top of the chart is [ love me like you do ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajtdxiazrmo ) - ellie golding ( because of 50 shades of grey ) [ take me to church ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mysvmgrr6pw ) - hozier [ uptown funk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opf0ybxqdm0 ) - mark ronson and bruno mars, 
  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6494.1990.tb00909.x/abstract some is a very different word to most . 
  ... the / s, 
  ... do you think protestants do n't have to eat or something ? 
   the religion part was one-sided , ... what a balanced view of the history you must have . 
  yeah mostly scottish presbyterians running from anglicans . 
  yes , we also have normal police cars . 
  we are a riot happy people ... 
  yeah because when counting corpses the ratios is what helps grieving families . 
  more european than the [ caucuses ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/europe_asia_transcontinental.png&amp;imgrefurl=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boundaries_between_continents&amp;h=996&amp;w=1268&amp;tbnid=iuz4fooqv6zgtm:&amp;docid=ibdemiqinjtbem&amp;ei=byckvqtqiypepyosnnao&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=0ahukewjk7-znnchkahudyg8khqmjb-oqmwgfkaawaa ), 
  [ no ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/europe_asia_transcontinental.png&amp;imgrefurl=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boundaries_between_continents&amp;h=996&amp;w=1268&amp;tbnid=iuz4fooqv6zgtm:&amp;docid=ibdemiqinjtbem&amp;ei=byckvqtqiypepyosnnao&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=0ahukewjk7-znnchkahudyg8khqmjb-oqmwgfkaawaa ) thats just factually not true . 
  you should see the upgraded ones . 
  we call them `` catapults '', 
  ... armenia , azerbaijan and georgia are all in asia . 
  would you consider kazakhstan european ? 
  limiting factors would probably be money and health care . 
  bad healthcare puts people off because the mortality is a high risk , it 's why all the countries are relatively well off . 
  if it costs more then doctors will push it in an attempt to basically upscale healthcare , or make money on the side by not declaring it . 
  there was actually a scandal in mexico several years ago where patients were charged for caesareans but the hospitals never paid taxes on them and they went down as ( cheaper and thus less taxed ) natural births . 
  the same can be seen in over crowded healthcare , such as the nhs where doctors will offer caesareans to be set up weeks in advance . 
  because ` time vs. money ' sometimes time wins . 
  which of those applies to turkey i have no idea . 
  i would assume time because they have a large nhs like structure , but a weaker economy ; so less beds ; so faster turnover i would assume . 
  is the us not a single market ? 
  because states tweak their economic privileges all the time . 
  new york focuses on financial businesses , oil in texas . 
   a company in spain must know that they can make their product one way , and sell that product anywhere from ireland to greece , ideally at the same price too . 
  this is one of the most stupid arguments i have ever heard . 
  an umbrella is gon na cost different in ireland and spain . 
  your argument your argument is that supply and demand should stop working in a single market . 
  a large orchard in poland is growing apples . 
  regionally the apples are gon na be quite cheap . 
  lots of apples , low costs , makes the apples cheap .
