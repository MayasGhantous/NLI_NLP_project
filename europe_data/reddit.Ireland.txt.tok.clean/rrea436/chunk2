  in northern ireland water is still state controlled ( it 's free aswell ) . 
  we never privatized it like on the main land . 
  my english friends still get confused when i explain that i do n't pay for water . 
  ( they do n't pay for water down south either but i think they are considering privatization ), 
   although i guess nobody has expectations of fun when it comes to luxembourg . 
  this has to be it . 
  luxembourg even sounds depressing . 
  i though iceland would be more fun . 
  and possibly more tourist reliant . 
  but i suppose that the temperature varients n iceland could make roller coasters unsafe . 
  til iceland hates fun . 
  except the uk 's position is very different to germany . 
  the uk has been aggressively condemning russia , and pushing georgian nato membership for years , two things that germany is very against . 
  comparing them to the berlin wall is over the line . 
  by like a mile . 
  you might want to do that for the next two weeks ... 
  it 's the 12th fortnight . 
  time to grab some ivory coast flags . 
  i was born with duel - as is everyone in northern ireland . 
  really whats the alternative . 
  ... you should not draw any conclusions from somebody flair , it 's reddit . 
  these camps are removed all the time they get rebuilt . 
  what are they supposed to do they are not applying for asylum in france , they do n't exist on any records ... 
  ... the first picture is from 2013 ... so yes ... 
  [ that 's just not true ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/border_morris ), 
  but ... france is nice ... why do you not want to stay in france . 
  or hell head east . 
  germany is right their guys . 
  just stop diving under trucks . 
  at least get a boat and row across or something . 
  ... well he can not live forever can he . 
  wow ... you could have just wrote `` the netherlands '', 
  i live in northern ireland ... yeah ... 
  `` home '' you townie fucks, 
  most defiantly not it 's own language , yeah . 
  i 'm fine with english because fuck ulster scots looks ugly written down . 
  like a 5 year old forgot how to spell . 
  seriously , `` oot and aboot '' is `` out and about '' . 
  i say it , never spell it , it 's so immature . 
  100 years ago the most influential nations of the modern eu , were about to declare all out war . 
  the eu flag should represent progress if nothing else . 
  were else do you think it 's going to be taught ? 
  are they gon na lift people of the streets ? 
  trogir , croatia this year . 
  i think it was in poland last year . 
  i ca n't tell ... 
  i think france is higher than the uk in the armies but britain still have a much larger navy . 
  edging them ahead . 
  most stats do n't take into account how air forces have leveled the playing field over water . 
  and we wo n't untill something awful happens . 
  this is a full contact competition . 
  bon , it is very violent and people often end up in hospital but more often they drink ale and find wenches ... 
  i 'm not joking, 
  the helmet might catch and snap your neck . 
  not the first at battle of nations . 
  you know the australians are recruiting , they fell short on numbers this year . 
  they might hold a live event . 
  full contact hurts like a bitch though you would want to make sure your not squeamish . 
  i just do n't like bombs . 
  this happens the backlash might kick-start another troubles . 
  he 's supposed to my favorite monarch though . 
  the uk ( in gerneral ni being the exception ) does n't use water cannons . 
  not even during the london riots . 
  boris 's position is `` during a riot we should probibly use these '' , fair enough , the reason that the last riots fizzed out is because rain . 
  we 're fucked if it happens . 
  end off . 
  i love how spain harps on about this like ceuta and melilla are not real . 
  other way around ... we did n't secede ... and this whole scotland debate is throwing tensions into overdrive again anyway , so we mind end up going for it after all . 
  i thought it was every thing north of london is the north everything south of london is france, 
  [ it 's big in america apparently ] ( http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.syerasite.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/rihanna-haircuts-1.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.syerasite.com/rihanna-haircuts/&amp;h=424&amp;w=500&amp;tbnid=gflvdil3klh_um:&amp;zoom=1&amp;docid=otnb6aicfvcx-m&amp;ei=1pkyu9_goovo7abprihibg&amp;tbm=isch ) but it 's just a short back and sides . 
  it 's pretty common , but it 's not exacitly connected with hitler youth ... like at all ever ... 
  i did not know this was a thing . 
   his use of the `` oil and vinegar '' analogy is very poor and a sign of populism , i thought it was a poor analogy because oil and vinegar is a salad dressing that works well together ... 
  i disagree ... oil and vinegar make a lovely dressing ... 
  it 's a culture thing mostly , women need more protection , and you can not be as harsh to women as you can to men . 
  imagine a man being punched in the face really hard . 
  imagine a woman being punched in the face really hard . 
  the cringe that the woman being punched is much more compared to the man , it 's the whole `` you can not hit a girl '' mentality . 
  it 's also because mens prisions are default , while females prisions are campaigned about constantly by femanist groups , to the point were they want to close them all in the uk . 
  [ no seriously ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13666066 ) would you find the same mentality in romania ? 
  ... you opened a map when you clicked on the link ... 
  in america women prisons get more funding compared to male prisons and have lower re-offending rates compared to male prisions because people can get free qualifications in jail . 
  i know that england/wales have the same , with the same result . 
  that is plausible ... and if anyone was going to be that convoluted it would be belarus . 
  than it would be red ... 
   the uk is a unitary state , a republic and a democracy . 
  mistype i think . 
  espicially because you have the uk later on aswell . 
  we are most definitely the texas of europe . 
  seriously the right wing , business capital , fossil fuel and fat guzzling giants , who constantly complain about migrants despite relying on them ... that is pretty damn texas . 
  thailand was allied to japan but initially neutral , once germany had crushed france thailand declared war over the unfair treaties the french imposed on them when redrawing the boarders of laos and cambodia , destabilizing the region post ww2 leading to the collapse of french indochina countries , and ultimately causing the vietnam war . 
  they also assisted the japanese invasion of burma ( i think it was burma ) and annexed several states until they end of the war . 
  [ ww2 map ] ( http://www.century-of-flight.net/aviation%20history/ww2/42.jpg ) the green is the allies and the lighter green is the post pearl-harbor group orange is the axis brazil 's main reason for joining was the attack on brazilian ships in the atlantic by germans . 
  look at that trend swing !, 
  shit 's like cocaine !, 
  it does n't , the eu accounts for about 20 % of uk immigration , most of that is poland and other east europe countries . 
  the other 80 % is commonwealth with whom we have lots of immigration treaties , most immigrants are pakistani , indian , caribbean , or cantonese ( hong kong ) ukip has stirred up populist support , over an issue , no-one who votes ukip actually understand the policies , they want to leave the eu and restrict freedom of movement , but ukip 's actual policies include increasing immigration from the commonwealth even further , mostly for skilled labour . 
  this makes little to no sense as the british population is already educated to a high degree and fills most skilled jobs , and we have a low skilled labour shortage , it 's also because the uk is viewed as some sort of shining light for improving your life and people conflate the vast amount of illegal immigration from france with legal immigration from the eu . 
  seriously they get to france [ and still try to get further .
