  were wolves not chased out of europe for the damage they do to livestock ? 
  what has been done to mitigate this problem ? 
  how much of this 2.5 million acres are that they want to `` re-wild '' is currently growing food for people and how do they plan on recouping the losses, 
  ha my mum and i had a laugh about this yesterday . 
  if the scottish leave we 'll just change the union jack from blue to black for the cornish . 
  why are they sinking into the sea ? 
  i understand the whole spliting belgium into two argument.but odds it 'll actually happen ? 
  slim . 
  absolutely nothing bad can come of this ... 
  georgia and armenia both have their own heads aswell . 
  my lowest score was 50 % and my highest was 58 % . 
  well it 's good to see ni stands united on not knowing what to do with europe . 
  the like minded users thing was pretty cool as well . 
  somehow i scored 100 % with gorenjska , slovenia . 
  ahh yes . 
  i remember when i first saw them . 
  my mother said they looked like smurfs on acid . 
  i can never see them as anything else . 
  does anything like a pipeline cross the n/s korea boarder now ? 
  because i do n't think that it 's gon na be their long before some troops dismantle it . 
  like geographically i do n't think that anyone is planning on installing thrusters and blasting the countries to another part of the world . 
  culturally yeah the division will remain , i doubt a cultural upheval will happen . 
  but the problem with calling it eastern europe is deciding where eastern europe is . 
  [ the eu divides europe into 4 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b7/european_sub-regions_%28according_to_eurovoc%2c_the_thesaurus_of_the_eu%29.jpg ) [ but the un divides it differently ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:europe_subregion_map_un_geoschme.svg ) [ american cia for how they see europe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:eastern-europe-map2.svg ) so defining what is eastern europe is already difficult . 
  is east european used to refer to a group with cultural similarities , is it geographic or is it a left over imprint from the cold war . 
  i do n't like this . 
  how are countries supposed to communicate if we use different webpages . 
  for example if we used a uk only internet would i be able to access reddit ? 
  would countries have `` open internet '' agreements ? 
  the minute that a country detaches from www is the moment it stops being the internet , and starts being a large propaganda tool . 
  same name but drop the e , it 's x-treme, 
  the uk is also the front runner on sea energy ( tidal and wave ), 
  man that stuff is delicious, 
  yeah late june . 
  looks like he just wants to bump it forward a month . 
  i know georgia is set to sign one in june as well , i wonder if they would have theirs bumped up to get them signed at the same time . 
  edit . 
  both countries have plans to also sign dcfta, 
  the uk will probably fill the caverns that their north sea deposits have left i would assume . 
  in the uk we will use age of empire 2 . 
  to revel in nostalgia like we always do . 
  he 's put his main market ( europe ) on the scramble for energy independence . 
  that is his power play . 
  he secured black sea ports permanently in exchange for basically destroying what the region had prior . 
  crimea wo n't be making money for a long time it 's main business was tourism . 
  it 's putting one identity infront of the other . 
  are you a german who happens to be european or are you a european who happens to be german . 
  it 's kinda how americans call themselves american before their state ( except maybe texas ), 
  i agree . 
  russia trying to grab even more land is going to send double standards ringing through the federation . 
  and the east is already calling for greater autonomy, 
  i do n't know what bothers me more . 
  the fact it exists or the fact it 's 12.5 euro . 
  i understand that 8 of them make 100 and i like that , but still . 
  why ? 
  are you talking about who would supply gas and oil to those countries ? 
  because the stans exports most of it and georgia relies on azerbaijan . 
  the only countries that you listed that really rely on russia are armenia and moldova . 
  where did this non-colonial germany come from ? 
  [ seriously guys ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_former_german_colonies ) is this a common misconception ? 
  arguing that former colonial powers has anything to do completely ignores spain and portugal as well . 
  the uk needed to get imf loans in the 70 and almost collapsed . 
  if not for the north sea deposits , and our shift to banking the uk would be about as rich as spain or portugal . 
  umm ... what ? 
  [ germany had colonies ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_former_german_colonies ) . 
  they got divided between the french and british after wwi . 
  they were german . 
  the german influence over china frightened japan so much they allied britain and declared war with them in 1914 . 
  the reason why their is two differnet samoa , one american one independent , is because the germans owned the other . 
  i would like a bridge off my island without using a boat . 
  but i do n't think it 's very likely . 
  unless we want to turn the isle of man into a giant round-a-bout, 
  well ... umm ... define independence ? 
   food stamps the uk does not have food stamps ... 
  i understand that your trying to point out the wealth gap that exists but frankly not the best way to try it . 
  well most travelers reject citizenship , and are therefore in the country illegally , with no papers or anything . 
  really hard to not end up a criminal . 
  whys is kosovo narrowed down so much and i can see different london burroughs , but it 's just solid poland and portugal . 
   de facto capital wait why is it de-facto ? 
  does switzerland not have an actual capital ? 
  i like it very simple . 
  but you guys really like that auroch legend do n't you ? 
  is it under construction already ? 
  because with out it it might cause a price spike in belarus, 
  they get caught out of posisition . 
  and your just taking the long way round, 
  baltic countries want to move away from russia i guess . 
  so i think that this is just companies wanting a slice of the pie . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persian_pipeline it 's under construction , already , so it may be closer than we think . 
  i quite like reuters . 
  it 's they can see where every one is and they can track troop movements . 
  helps identify flanking maneuvers and such, 
  okey so these crazies are completly out of line , but the reason for the protest for legit . 
  they bussed people from the republic to belfast because their is no great clamour in belfast for further irish language in schools . 
  all government buildings and paperwork are in irish as well as english . 
  so please do n't dismiss the point of the protest just because a couple of nazi cuntbags also disagree with it . 
  armenia and azerbaijain are at it again ? 
  in other news water is wet . 
  wait put aside politics ? 
  is that not the entire point of the referendium .
