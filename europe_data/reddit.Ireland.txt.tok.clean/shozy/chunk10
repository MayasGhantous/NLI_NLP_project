  sorry i must n't have explained myself very well because you 're not really addressing what i said . 
  i guess a tl ; dr of my post would be : what is `` within the single market '' is made complicated by intellectual property being transferred into it . 
  --  the commissions standpoint is that taxation should be equal for all companies operating in a country and my understanding is irish government and apple are saying the law is equal for all companies just that apple were in a different position to other companies . 
   company operating in ireland what is a company operating in ireland though ? 
  filed it 's paperwork here , managed from here , has x number of employees here or some other criteria ? 
  listen do n't get me wrong i think the commission are right in their judgement but apple and the irish and us governments are right that in a perfectly logical world it does n't make sense that this tax should be paid in ireland . 
  i might be wrong , i took a look at the report methodology section and could n't see anything supporting what i said , or any other explanation for that specific measure so i dunno . 
  i thought i remembered something about it from when it came out . 
  do n't quote me on this but i think the issue is the intellectual property was transferred into the eu ( according to the commission , according to irish law it 's in a company managed from abroad so does n't count as irish ) . 
  so there 's an argument that the profits due to that ip should go to where that ip really came from , which is almost entirely the us , not from were it 's artificially been transferred to . 
  that 's tricky though because there needs to be genuine ways of transferring ip , so another argument is that were that ip is actually implemented should be where it 's counted . 
  so that 's almost entirely china . 
  the ec 's argument i think would be that those both deal with `` should '' and they do n't represent the current reality . 
  and the current reality is that ireland is in the best position to tax those profits and it 's unfair to other companies operating in the eu if it does n't . 
  again i 'm fairly sure i have oversimplified something so i 'm open to correction from anyone who knows better . 
  tax on profits that accrued within ireland , i believe . 
  you 've actually stumbled on exactly the reason/excuse the irish government gives for not collecting this tax . 
   [ the irish finance minister ] added : `` i do n't know whether you have an apple iphone or not near you but if you look at the small print on the back of it , it says designed in california , manufactured in china and that means that any profits that accrued , did n't accrue in ireland , so i ca n't see why the tax liability is in ireland . '' [ source ] ( http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/noonan-may-have-good-reasons-to-appeal-apple-ruling-but-rejecting-13bn-will-haunt-government-35007583.html ), 
  irish nationals are around 85 % of the population or over 4million people , the highest number since 1871 . http://www.cso.ie/multiquicktables/quicktables.aspx?id=cdd26, 
  why would the mere presence of foreigners wreck our culture ? 
  so are they going to breach the belfast agreement or have a different rule for northern ireland ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/good_friday_agreement#equality_and_human_rights or as usual have they just forgotten that northern ireland exists ? 
   the greedy * southern irish * to continue with their corrupt , tax dodging regime ? 
  hey , you leave the healy rae 's out of this !, 
  ircc the other replies are sort of wrong in the details but you 're wrong in practice . 
  the irish constitution ** is ** the highest law in ireland but eu law `` overrules '' it because the constitution says that it does . 
  another way of thinking about it is that eu law is irish law . 
  anyway the person you 're replying to is wrong we wo n't pay anything . 
  the judgement if it 's ruled to be state aid would be that apple has to pay us ( the irish exchequer ) money . 
  we really do n't lose anything no matter what happens and if it is only $ 1 billion or less it could be an advantage to us because it means no one else can encourage apple to move to them like we did . 
  even as an attempted straw man it 's wrong , assad is n't singlehandedly directing all the government forces and they would n't disappear if he resigned or signalled that he would agree to step down as part of future peace negotiations . 
  we have an airforce ( as part of the army ) , it just does n't contain any jets . 
  ( it has non-jet aircraft ), 
  what specifically are you referring to ? 
  edit : for any observers reading this , i 'm aware of no catholic army ever trying to invade england from ireland , there were some who may have wanted to but they were always defeated in ireland before they ever had enough of a foothold to mount any sort of invasion of great britain . 
  the uk government is n't actually anti-immigration though , they 'll just increase non-eu immigration , which has had a ( small ) negative effect on those on the lowest wages before now but the government does n't actually care about that , as evidenced by the much larger negative effect their other policies have had on those with lower incomes . 
  they 're gone already . 
  within economics `` mainstream economists '' is used to differentiate between the vast majority of economists and those who follow [ `` heterodox economics '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heterodox_economics ) your marxism , austrian school economics and such . 
  even economists who are spouting a big company line do differ though . 
  some regulations suit big companies because they prevent competition from arising and some of the biggest opponents of real free trade are big companies who want to maintain subsidies and an unfair home market place for themselves . 
   newspapers are good to get exposure , that 's a nice joke . 
   when i say newspapers i mean news websites as well of course . 
  i think we 'd be surprised the power at `` helping '' people form their opinions actual paper newspapers still have though . 
  anyway the point being that having the ear of the government is the same for economists and non-economists alike , it 's mostly about telling them what they already believed . 
  they did n't do a 180 at all . 
  there 's two sets of predictions there 's `` if britain leaves the single market '' which has the dire predictions ( like the one in op ) and there 's if the uk stays in the single market which are n't as bad . 
  the remain campaign responded to the leave campaigns promises of taking back control , e.g. 
  of immigration , by quoting the consequences of leaving the single market , which is what would need to be done to get control over that . 
  newspapers are now quoting what is expected by experts if the uk stays in the single market because that is the most likely outcome of negotiations . 
   attempts at forecasting are pretty much pointless there 's different types of forecasting . 
  it 's like climate and weather ( above a week away ) . 
  we ca n't accurately predict what the weather will be in 7 days time . 
  we might be able to make a better than chance guess but that 's the best we can do and there 's a lot of completely unexpected things that can happen which completely throw the prediction . 
  the same is true of economists , if they say `` there will be a recession next year '' then you should be wary of them then . 
  but that does n't mean we ca n't talk about the trend of the overall climate and say if x conditions are met we expect there will be y changed to the climate and for that to be . 
  so if on the other hand , like op 's article they say `` if the uk leaves the single market , we expect that the overall effect will be 4 % lower gdp than it would have been otherwise , '' then that 's a doable prediction , it could still be wrong of course but it 's an easier prediction to make . 
  edit : fixed typos, 
  do n't know how to respond to this , was going to be jokey but i 'll try being ernest . 
  you 're wrong . 
  about what economists do , about them being a single group and about the amount of power they 've had and about exposure they get . 
  good economists tend to avoid making straight predictions to use an analogy it 's more like climate science than weather forecasting . 
  they can tell you if x happens it will have y effect overall but they ca n't tell you `` in 3 weeks time it will rain '' and it 's not ( should n't be ) their job to do so . 
  economists , being people and all , have a wide array of opinions on matters . 
  in fact they 're renowned for it with jokes about how if you ask 3 economists for an opinion you 'll get 4 different opinions . 
  so to say they always have `` the same conclusions towards free market and whatnot '' is really off the mark . 
  when a lot of them agree on something it does really mean something !, 
  ( and a large majority of mainstream economists , at least outside the us favour placing some limits on the free market ) lastly economists generally do n't have special exposure , pretty much every newspaper has a letters/opinion pages which is filled with the `` angry man at the bar '' people and there 's a trend of constantly asking people 's opinions in tv current affairs programs . 
  that 's about the same level of influence most economists have . 
  there are economists who work for the government but they 're ignored to the same extent as the `` angry people at the bar '' who work for the government are . 
  so do you have polls from about trust in the fed from 30 years ago ? 
  the dollar is the worlds biggest reserve currency by a long way there are trillions of dollars worth of trust placed in the credibility and trust of the us dollar . 
  but if you 're using polls then the ecb is n't trusted either . 
  trust in it is at 33 % ( [ eurobarometer 2015 public opinion in the european union ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/survey/getsurveydetail/instruments/standard/yearfrom/1973/yearto/2015/surveyky/2098 ) ) i could n't easily find an equivalent poll for the fed but [ this 2014 poll ] ( http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/general_business/february_2014/50_don_t_trust_fed_to_keep_inflation_interest_rates_down ) says :  43 % of american adults are at least somewhat confident that the fed can keep inflation and interest rates down . 
  so neither are trusted by your metric , with the ecb possibly being * less * trusted . 
  my conclusion is n't that the ecb should n't be trusted though , just that that is a very poor metric . 
  after all it is the worlds * second * biggest reserve currency . 
  are you suggesting the fed does n't have those things ? 
  what reason is that ? 
  [ hp sauce ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hp_sauce ), 
  i can see how people can disagree but what 's straw man like about it ? 
  in any poll i 've seen a big majority are in favour of ttip in ireland , especially if the poll question says `` a free trade treaty between the eu and the us '' instead of using ttip by name , we just like referendums . 
  though there has been very little talk about it , just a few newspaper/online articles about it so it could change if there was a proper debate/campaign . 
  if i had to guess people want a referendum so that the contents of the treaty are put before the people , legal experts give their opinion and there 's a proper public debate about it . 
  i 'm not aware of anyone who is against the eu on economic/anti-free trade reasons . 
  the no votes for lisbon and ( i think you mean ) nice were not based on economics they were based on fear that we were ceding too much control to the eu and/or that it can not be trusted . 
  specific issues are emphasised by the no campaign ^ * , abortion , eu army ( and more extreme claims of conscription ) and corporation tax . 
  none of which were actually in either treaty . 
  there was also an anti-eu enlargement/immigration which was n't part of the mainstream no campaigns . 
  a big part of it is apathy on the potential yes side , especially true in the nice treaty vote , the turn out was only 34 % . 
  there was also an argument put forward of `` if you do n't know vote no , '' which i think swayed a lot of people in the first votes for both because politicians ( who were overwhelmingly in favour of the treaties ) made little to no effort to explain * note here i say the campaign , i talked to some no voters who had some reasonable arguments based on what was actually in the treaties like a loss of vetoes in some areas . 
  also important to note that voting no did not mean leaving the eu only meant voting against the direction the eu was going in . 
  the yes campaigns were also pretty bad , either assuming the result and not explaining anything or saying broad slogans like `` yes for jobs '' and still not explaining anything . 
  this was n't really an eli5 but there you go . 
  so why have n't they in the meantime continued this funding until 2020 ( the end of the current period ) ? 
  the only reason it appears to have stopped is the mere risk that they 'll have to fund the eu half of it when they 're no longer eligible for it which will also be when they do n't have to contribute . 
  if the intention is to maintain it without eu help then the pause makes no sense at all . 
  there does seem to be evidence backing up what you 're saying but what 's niggling me is that it means other powerful forces are doing nothing about it . 
  why is the cia not `` leaking '' this information about trump - putin deals , do you think ? 
  why is the obama administration not doing so ? 
  or the clinton campaign ?
