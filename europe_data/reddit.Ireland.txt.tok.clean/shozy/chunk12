  i 'm no expert but from what little i have read hydrogen does worse than modern batteries in terms of lifecycle emissions . 
  that was in terms of putting it into a car though so maybe it 's different with trains or maybe that 's changed ( or maybe what i read was wrong ) , it 's a pretty important question though !, 
  they were n't told the truth about it , also who knows how they voted maybe they did vote for mps who would have compromised . 
  it 's not as if mps ran on anti-civil rights platforms either . 
   perhaps its about time to stop whining and accept that the ira were murderers too , nothing , literally nothing excuses the behavior of someone who supports or actively kills innocent ordinary civilians and to be quite frank its disgusting that people in a modern civilized society still think the ira were justified . 
  they are no better than the people who support middle-eastern terrorists angry at the bad decisions british and american troops made in the middle-east . 
  the ira were murders too . 
  happy ? 
  frankly you can fuck off for suggesting i support them . 
  the civil rights movement in the north did try to stand up for their rights peacefully and they were n't listened to at all and then bloody sunday caused many of them to consider peaceful means a failure . 
  not only were they gunned down in the street while peacefully protesting the weight of the state closed ranks and accused them of provoking it and of being terrorists . 
  maybe he does n't but if he does n't he 's stumbled on a true point anyway . 
  i do think he missed your point but you let yourself get irritated by that ( and his tone ) instead of pointing that out to him . 
  yes . 
  i 'm not arguing with you . 
  he is both responsible for being a leader of an organisation that killed civilians and for leading them to cease killing civilians/anyone . 
  that was n't what busypedro meant either as he later clarified  not reeeally what i said , i just think it was a silly choice of event by the daily mail . 
  also `` arrested the wrong people '' is very different to `` deliberately perverting the course of justice '' . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/60wc9a/comparison_of_daily_mail_front_page_today_in/dfa04mu/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=europe both are making a point around it being a poor choice of event to show if the point is to illustrate mcguinness ' unjust terrorism . 
  the perversion of justice and other events like it would have been used to try to recruit people to the ira at the time . 
  i do n't think that 's his point . 
  his point is that those people in the pub did n't throw the first stone either . 
  they did n't make any of the decisions . 
  his change is not that he just stopped it is that he ( is credited for ) successfully encouraged and lead others to stop . 
   does this in anyway change the fact he was the leader of a terrorist organizations ? 
  --   this both are aspects of his life . 
   well yeah ... --  just so you do n't learn the wrong thing from my comment above , i utterly condemn the ira and all terrorism . 
  you 're repeatedly attacking a strawman and making no effort to understand icanicant34 's point, 
  yeah , handled by a different office though . 
  sorry did n't actually include my source which would have made things clearer . 
  the office i 'm talking about is the [ eu treaty rights unit ] ( http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/inis/pages/eutreatyrightsfaqs ) so they 're dealing with eea permanent resident requests . 
  and actually , ( i did n't see this until now ) , normal residency requests by non-eea partners and children of eea citizens ( except irish ) . 
  so i was thinking there 'd be a 5 year lag in demand for them though maybe not entirely because of the partners and children . 
  also , we do n't talk about our growth rate , there 's nothing to see there , move along . 
  unemployment rate has been steadily falling though hopefully that keeps up , we 're at around 7 % now . 
  thanks !, 
  could you find me some of that bitching and moaning about the 50,000 figure ? 
  here 's a guardian article that agrees with the 50,000 figure but says it 's not a surge and gives out about the ukip claim of 5,000 per week which would have been about 260,000 a year . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/30/no-surge-romanian-bulgarian-migrants-controls-lifted my recollection at the time is of people deriding the much higher estimates by politicians and newspapers not the 50,000 figure . 
  i 'm not british though so i could easily have missed it . 
  well you need to be here 5 years so the effect of brexit would n't be showing yet . 
  ca n't find any figures but there 's apparently an up to 12 week delay in ** acknowleding receipt ** to applications and expected 10 month delay in responding . 
  that 'd probably be mainly due to lack of staff due to previous years of austerity though . 
  ca n't imagine that numbers arriving in ireland increased much in 2011 . 
  will do , friend . 
  yeah but i meant more when unionists use it like the way / u/sigma914 was jokingly using it . 
  funny thing about `` free state '' is that extreme republicans use it when talking about roi institutions as well . 
  not sure how many are offended by it nowadays , probably just think less of the person saying it . 
  i actually find it hilarious when it 's used as an attempt at an insult because of the literal meaning of it . 
  how dare you call me free !, 
  escape from la, 
  borders are in your mind , bro . 
  parties a , b and c made an agreement . 
  party a and party c want to continue with the agreement . 
  party b wants to leave the agreement . 
  who stopped the agreement ? 
  why 'd you ask for elaboration when you know everything already ? 
  complain about what , bud ? 
  history . 
  yeah we 're a ** member ** of the eu , so we will do what we tell ourselves to do alright , mate . 
  if you like ... but you ca n't then turn around and say that it 's the eu 's fault like some posters are trying to do . 
  i agree that 's what they want to try . 
  it 's not going to happen though , we 're consistently the ones with the highest polls for staying in the eu : http://www.independent.ie/business/brexit/80pc-agree-with-ireland-staying-in-eu-35329406.html, 
  people from northern ireland are eligible for irish citizenship so they 'll have those rights anyway . 
  http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/in-call-to-mexican-president-trump-threatens-invasion it 's a different kind of crazy than it sounds initially . 
  i like your stylo !, 
  there 's only 2 weeks between the rounds though so that 's unlikely . 
   just using 2 overly used shitty examples here . 
  use a non-political example , i do n't think i 'm grasping your point from those examples . 
   people can have opposing views and still both be right . 
  then they do n't actually have opposing opinions then . 
  `` i like ice cream '' and `` i do n't like ice cream '' are both true , but they 're not opposing views . 
  arguments like `` ice cream is the best '' vs `` ice cream is the worst '' are opposing . 
  it 's a stupid argument and both are wrong because it 's treating a preference as an objective fact . 
  you 're doing the reverse of that though you 're treating arguments about `` 1 +1 = 2 '' vs `` 1 +1 = 10 '' as if they were arguments about ice cream . 
  of course both can be wrong or it can turn out that the whole thing is a misunderstanding and the second one was using binary , in which case they were n't really opposing . 
  i was being a bit facetious in my original post but it is a bug bear of mine of people treating differing opinions about preferences the same as opposing opinions about objectivity reality . 
  anarcho-authoritarian is an oxymoron . 
  anarchy ca n't be authoritarian , it can be repressive but it 's impossible for it to be authoritarian . 
  riots and property damage are n't fascism and can not be considered fascism . 
  it 's offensive to the millions of victims of fascism to devalue the word like that . 
  nor are riots and property damage authoritarian even if their aims are to stiffle free speech . 
  it can be a sign that those people would favour an authoritarian government in their favour but those acts by people who have no authority are not authoritarian . 
  words have real meanings , just because two things are bad it does n't mean the same words apply to both . 
  this might come across as pedantic but after what happened in the bowling green massacre it 's important to be accurate and truthful . 
  well , duh !, 
  do you hold opinions that in your opinion are wrong ? 
  they were n't bitching about having to pay back the debt , they correctly , repeatedly said that there is no way they 'll be able to pay it back but they were forced to take additional debt and implement austerity anyway with no plan to offer their people as a sign for when it might be over . 
  i 'm not saying they do n't carry responsibility but what you said is inaccurate . 
  they had a good point , backed up by imf advice . 
  unfortunately the least damaging thing politically for the other leaders was to kick the can down the road again and again . 
  do you know if i can get my pay check from them ** and ** from soros ? 
  or is it just one or the other ? 
  and who did he compare to hitler ? 
  and now that 's a strawman and i 'm certain you did n't actually read the article . 
   amother example is the `` russia hacked the election '' campaign . 
  no voting machines where touched there is a difference between poor journalism as a result of the pressures they 're under and lies . 
  they accurately reported that academics said that they study said it was hacked . 
  this is true , but it 's extremely misleading . 
  unfortunately thats a symptom of the pressure to be the first to publish and the immediacy of 24 hour news .
