  they added an 'm ' so it also means `` ramming stone . '', 
  here 's another paper that emphasises that it 's not really a lack of capital that would cause a recaptialisation to be necessary rather a lack of credibility . 
  the ecb could fulfill its functions with a negative balance sheet http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp392.pdf, 
  the guy is talking shit about a terrorist attack that happened right beside his friends and family 's homes , he 's entitled to be pissed off . 
  it 's like telling a new yorker that it was actually a missile that hit one of the twin towers because that 's what some people claimed to have seen at the time . 
  you play devils advocate when there is a debate to be had . 
  it 's not up for debate , it 's just wrong . 
  yeah people said they saw it that way but they were wrong , end of story . 
   if you 're going to shit on someone 's solution then there 's an onus on you to suggest a reasonable alternative or you can be accused of sulking . 
  there 's a huge difference between saying `` we 'll have a technological solution '' and actually providing a technological solution . 
  the irish government ** have ** provided a reasonable alternative and have lobbied the eu to accept it . 
  that is a special status for northern ireland and the border enforced on sea crossings . 
  that is the easiest to enforce with the least change from the status quo . 
   i ca n't imagine a workable arrangement without them , can you ? 
  that 's why coveneys dismissal of them seemed churlish to me . 
  yes because `` tech '' is so broad that it covers every possible solution . 
  a policeman using a torch to pull over every single vehicle is `` tech . '', 
   there will inevitably be political fences to get over and nobody is doing the hard work of pushing for positive ways over them . 
  the eu side ( including ireland ) ca n't be the side pushing the direction ( , positive or otherwise , ) because the eu ca n't decide what the uk wants . 
  the eu wants the status quo they do n't want to go over any fences . 
  what if that 's because they wo n't work ? 
  it 's not helpful to pretend an empty mantra like `` tech solutions '' will mean a `` seamless '' or `` frictionless '' border . 
  again the uk government says it 's possible so present the proposal already !, 
  except they ca n't because not only do they not have one , again ** they have n't chosen what type of brexit to have ** tech solutions can work if you 're specific and you blow up a load of roads and block locals from rebuilding them to reduce the number of crossings to a mangable level . 
  that 's a long way from frictionless though . 
  even then you have to sort out the massive amounts of people who have property stradling the border . 
  did you read the comments ? 
   it is the british and the brexiteers who are leaving , so if anyone should be angry it 's us quite frankly . 
  but we 're not going to get angry . 
  ** we are going to try and find solutions that will benefit or at least minimise the damage to relations between britain and ireland , to the peace process and to trading links . 
  ** but what we are not going to do is design a border for the brexiteers . 
   `` they are the ones who want a border , it is up to them to say what it is , to say how it would work and to first of all convince their own people , their own voters , that this is actually a good idea , '' he said . 
  the uk has to decide on what brexit they want !, 
  ireland ca n't choose for them he 's not * just * saying `` this is your mess , '' he 's pointing out the simple fact that we ca n't make the decision for them ( and if we could it would be that they stay in the eu . ), 
  i do n't think it 's accurate to say food aid increased the number of starving people today . 
  [ ethiopia population graph , source for below figures ] ( http://www.populationpyramid.net/ethiopia/1985/ ) ethiopia doubled in size in just under 30 years to 1985 , and then doubled in just over 25 years . 
  without that change it the difference would be there 'd be 100 million in 2022 instead of 2017 but the same amount or more would have died because birth rates also declined after intervention so the faster growth is due to fewer deaths per year : around 1985 also marks when [ crude birth rate ] ( https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/spdyncbrtineth ) and [ fertility rates ] ( https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/spdyntfrtineth ) started to fall . 
  here 's [ life expectancy ] ( https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/spdynle00ineth ) i 've read many things like your source which says that live aid style aid is ineffective and counter productive and prolongs authoritarian regimes , i have heard nothing to suggest it increases population size . 
  most likely despite what happened in the 80s ethiopia is in an improved position and despite it 's much larger population is expected to avoid full scale famine despite a worse drought than the 80s ( proving the point of your article that the drought was n't the true cause . ), 
  http://time.com/4209936/ethiopia-drought/ even looking at absolute numbers fewer people this time around suffer from malnutrition and the number of deaths is comparatively tiny . 
  only caring about people who have something to do with you is sociopathy . 
  it 's not necessary to care the exact same amount but not caring at all is the problem . 
  considering in famine/starvation situations infant mortality shoots up massively it absolutely is because of where they were born . 
   africa has 60 % of the word 's arable land and 15 % of the world 's population right , starvation is not an inevitable situation . 
  when there is starvation something is going wrong . 
   the fact that their populations are rising shows that they do n't need any more help from us . 
  overall it 's likely that we 've hurt more than we 've helped . 
  the best way to help could be to focus on reducing the damage we are doing , including climate change and other pollution and adjusting our agricultural subsidies to balance better the effect on markets that ca n't afford to match them and our want for food security . 
  reducing support for extremists and those who support extremists would help too . 
  caring does not have to involve massive direct intervention into foreign countries , that can often go wrong . 
  yes the fact that we care about people dying is one of the reasons why we have to do more about climate change and desertification . 
  nothing i do n't agree with in your post . 
  climate change could definitely lead to more collapsed countries and more refugees . 
  we need to prevent/reduce that from happening . 
  he specifically said not caring . 
  not caring if other people starve is sociopathic . 
  being resigned and thinking you ca n't do anything is n't sociopathic . 
  right now absolute poverty is being reduced and as a result birth rates are lowering . 
  increased population also does not have to mean a proportional increase in people coming over in boats . 
  like population is n't as dramatically higher than it was 10 years ago when there were much fewer coming . 
  syria and libya collapsed . 
  a relatively small portion of the world is responsible for that plastic . 
  it ca n't be linked to overpopulation at all . 
  you can argue that a similar but bigger problem will come from having more people but it just is n't true that our biggest environmental problems are down to too many people like many in this post are suggesting . 
  it 's responsibility of relatively few of us . 
  looking at co2 [ the richest 10 % are responsible for 50 % of lifetime co2 . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/02/worlds-richest-10-produce-half-of-global-carbon-emissions-says-oxfam ), 
  those are n't the two options though . 
  well those of us who are n't sociopaths do and will care about lots of people dying just because of where they were born . 
  we even know what works to bring birth rates down now and letting people die increases birth rates . 
   by virtually every refugee so what about the gay refugees from those countries ? 
  i think any state has to agree to abide by the ruling of the icj for a case to go ahead , it 'd be damaging to the court and build on the damage between the eu and the uk if the uk refused . 
  refusing the case would also be seen as an admission by most people around the world that the court would likely have found in the eu 's favour . 
  the values involved , especially the realistic values not the 100 billion , would not be worth the international damage to the court and the uk . 
  though obviously if accepting that damage was likely to win an election they 'd probably go through with it . 
   but sueing does n't necessarily mean they will win . 
  of course that 's why i said `` guarantee '' . 
  the best part of no deal being `` maybe '' paying nothing to the eu , is much worse that definitely paying nothing . 
  i 'm fairly sure that what you 're describing is what the eu will be negotiated down to within a deal anyway . 
  $ 50 - $ 60 billion is what anyone from the eu has mentioned ( and iirc that was n't barnier or his team yet , so even that is n't official ) to my understanding the only one who has included every possible thing and come up with $ 100 billion is the financial times . 
  i fully suspect that uk negotiators will argue that the uk 's share of eu assets will be subtracted from the uk 's obligations in negotiation . 
  on top of that within negotiations the uk can argue for a more favourable payment schedule . 
  i ca n't see any such argument being possible in a no deal situation the eu will argue that the uk unilaterally forfeited its rights to any assets but it ca n't unilaterally withdraw from its obligations . 
  would that argument hold sway ? 
  i 've no idea but it 's a worse situation for everyone and the uk in particular than the current one were they can engage in negotiations to minimise the amount they have to pay . 
  point being i think even just on the `` divorce bill '' the worst realistically possible `` bad deal '' is no deal . 
  no deal does not guarantee that the uk wo n't have to pay anything . 
  if there 's no deal the eu will sue the uk . 
  http://uk.businessinsider.com/eu-sue-britain-50-billion-brexit-bill-2017-3 obviously that can go several ways but if avoiding paying anything is the motivation for no deal it 's not a great plan . 
  uk part of it was n't so bad iirc after the negotiations . 
  still , we are giving it back and they will make a profit from it . 
  i do n't think we 're going to come to an agreement . 
  as i said i think availability of the information only affects the continuation of the asymmetry not wether there is one or not . 
  just as a small point the difference between countries is n't available for them on the packet they only get half the picture from that . 
   that 's not information asymmetry what definition are you using ? 
  your source is wrong .
