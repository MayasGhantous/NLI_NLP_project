   any chance of our bailout money back ? 
  thought not . 
  the bailout money was a loan ... 
  i do n't know enough about the specific situation to say but it could easily be that germans do not have the same level of information asymmetry , for example because of stronger/more well known consumer organisations or maybe the brands were trusted more in czechia but less in germany . 
  there could also be more competition in germany . 
  the overall point is just that consumer preference is n't the only variable between the different capitalistic societies in different countries . 
  and that one way in which producers have an advantage over consumers is information asymmetry . 
  information asymmetry can arise just because you did n't know what question to ask . 
  there does n't have to be any external block for it to happen . 
  yes , if there 's no block you 'd expect eventually that information asymmetry to be addressed but it looks like that 's exactly what 's happening . 
  we live in a capitalistic society with [ information asymmetry . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/information_asymmetry ) the ones selling the inferior produce had more information than the buyers . 
  it does n't require a conspiracy for the market price ( and therefore the prices by various different chains ) to be unfairly in favour producers over consumers . 
  now that that information asymmetry is being addressed the quality difference should stabilise to one that actually reflects consumer preferences rather than their lack of information about the quality of their food . 
  i do n't have time to reply right now and might n't tomorrow . 
  i 've striked out dishonest though because you are engaging honestly with me . 
  you 're completely ignoring the timeline , she blocked a unilateral statement ** directly ** after the vote . 
  that 's not a reaction to anyone else 's decisions that was her decision alone . 
  this was before any bilateral deal , before theresa may was pm , all the other candidates for conservative party leader favoured making a unilateral statement she specifically avoided it and it 's just come out that she blocked it within cabinet as well . 
  it was all over your news , which can be read/watched outside the uk you know . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/04/tory-backlash-as-theresa-may-fails-to-guarantee-eu-citizens-righ/ may from before she was leader set out her stall that eu and uk citizens would be bargaining chips . 
   the eu could have made a unilateral statement . 
  it could have accepted the bilateral statement . 
  well firstly no it ca n't , it would be 27 different unilateral statements . 
  immigration rules for non-eu nationals are set nationally . 
  merkel , hollande and others also chose not to make unilateral statements from very early on , they 're not any better . 
  i never said they were . 
  [ the prime minister of portugal did make a unilateral statement . 
  ] ( http://algarvedailynews.com/news/9204-portugal-s-pm-and-words-of-comfort-rights-for-british-in-portugal-will-be-protected )  refusing to negotiate until a50 is not a law it is something the eu decided to do . 
  you 're also conveniently ignoring the fact that originally a50 was going to be enacted `` first thing '' after the vote , then after the tory leadership contest which was estimated to be on september 2nd but was actually much faster . 
  then more vague timeline of early 2017 and then finally march and even then no one was 100 % sure that it would actually definitely go ahead in march until it was march . 
  it is in that context that may attempted to make a bilateral agreement . 
  to use your words : refusing to negotiate by delaying a50 is not a law it is something the conservatives decided to do . 
   hold the uk and the eu to the same standard and judge from there . 
  anything else is farcical . 
  that 's what i 'm doing , you 're the one pretending that it was n't mays intention from the start to use eu and uk citizens as bargaining chips . 
  i fully admit that merkel , hollande and others were just as bad . 
  that 's fairly ~ ~ dishonest ~ ~ inaccurate they did n't refuse the offer , they refused to negotiate one of the key questions of brexit before the brexit negotiations had started . 
  they could have made a unilateral statement which may it seems [ specifically blocked such a statement being made post-brexit vote ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/23/brexit-may-blocked-unilateral-offer-for-eu-citizens-rights-last-june ), 
  echr is separate from the eu it is drafted by the council of europe . 
  if the uk also decides to leave echr and the council of europe then it will be breaching the good friday agreement unless they arrange a special status for ni . 
   the eu seem to be attempting to cling on to the current system , while the uk is clearly drawing its own red lines over that point . 
  the current system is the mutually agreed upon international framework for rights for eu citizens . 
  the uk agreed to it and have now decided to leave it . 
  it is not unreasonable that as a starting point for negotiations the eu side wants to maintain what the uk agreed to in the past . 
  uk citizens want to leave and are being represented by the uk side . 
  eu citizens want their rights which were guaranteed in the past to continue to be guaranteed and the eu are doing their job representing the eu side . 
  i do n't think either side ( since the start of negotiations last monday ) has been unreasonable yet . 
   anything else involves one partner dictating internal matters and rules to the other . 
  again you 're talking as if brexit is n't the change in the status quo . 
  all partners agreed to follow a shared set of rules ( eu rights for eu citizens ) now one partner wants to leave that agreement . 
  it is not dictating for an opening position be that the uk continue doing what it agreed to in the past . 
  will that be the final position , no not if that 's not what the uk wants but the eu is perfectly in their right to say this is what we want . 
  also while it does not necessarily relate to the eu exactly the good friday agreement is wrapped up in supra-national human rights . 
  the irish/nationalist side did not trust the uk without additional oversight could be a fair arbitrator of human rights . 
  it is an international treaty that `` dictates '' the internal matters of part of the uk except it 's one both parties agreed to . 
   in finalising the terms of the good friday agreement , the uk government undertook to complete the incorporation into northern ireland law of the european convention of human rights , ensuring `` direct access to the courts , and remedies for breach of the convention , including power for the courts to overrule assembly legislation on grounds of inconsistency '' . 
  the commitment was honoured in the text of the 1998 uk human rights act , in particular section 7 , while the irish government moved to strengthen the protection of human rights in its jurisdiction by enacting the european convention on human rights act 2003 . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.iiea.com/blogosphere/brexit-the-good-friday-agreement-and-the-european-convention-on-human-rights ), 
  the eu wants british citizens in the uk to have british and eu rights too , that is the status quo . 
  it 's britain that wants to withdraw those eu rights from its citizens , the eu is placing a condition ( as an offer to be negotiated ) that eu citizens ( which if the parliament 's proposal was accepted would include british people who opt in to it ) do not have their eu rights withdrawn from them by brexit . 
  as for reciprocity , it is reciprocal , citizens living in another eu country get ** the national rights of that country ** and eu rights . 
  the british side could make a counter offer of your proposal of having specifically british rights but then firstly the uk would have to make institutions to enforce that . 
  that would open up a similar accusation to yours on unfairness because then british citizens in for example germany would have , british , eu ** and german ** rights whereas german citizens would only have eu and german rights . 
  the uk will have and always has had full control over which non-eu citizens to allow in to the uk . 
  the [ european council ( art . 
  50 ) guidelines for brexit negotiations  ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/04/29-euco-brexit-guidelines/ )  the right for every eu citizen , and of his or her family members , to live , to work or to study in any eu member state is a fundamental aspect of the european union . 
  along with other rights provided under eu law , it has shaped the lives and choices of millions of people . 
  agreeing reciprocal guarantees to safeguard the status and rights derived from eu law at the date of withdrawal of eu and uk citizens , and their families , affected by the united kingdom 's withdrawal from the union will be the first priority for the negotiations . 
  such guarantees must be effective , enforceable , non-discriminatory and comprehensive , including the right to acquire permanent residence after a continuous period of five years of legal residence . 
  citizens should be able to exercise their rights through smooth and simple administrative procedures . 
  the european parliament has gone further proposing [ british citizens be allowed opt in to eu citizenship . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-citizenship-keep-freedom-of-movement-guy-verhofstadt-chief-negotiator-opt-in-passports-a7465271.html ) i believe that 's all british citizens not just those in the eu ( outside the uk ), 
  yes on crossing the border goods would be inspected . 
  i think it was the start of the single market in 1993 that got rid of the border checks . 
  passport free travel for citizens of both countries but cta did n't cover customs checks . 
  it 's impossible to prove that they wo n't be consumed by the sea and drown post brexit . 
  all the evidence to date suggests that everyone who leaves the eu will die . 
  atlantis shows that it impossible to exist outside the eu . 
  the people support blurry brexit not clear brexit !, 
  to add to that it 'd be `` u\u00ed sh\u00failleabh\u00e1in '' if it 's her married name . 
  so : \u00d3 is for `` son of the descendent of ... '' n\u00ed is for `` daughter of the descendent of ... '' u\u00ed is for `` wife of the descendent of ... '' they all get anglicised to o ' . 
  there 's also : mac which is `` son of ... '' nic for `` daughter of the son of '' mhic for `` wife of the son of '' which get anglicised to mc . 
  they looked up what the opposite of a republican is !, 
  149 arrests is for total terrorism not just jihadi , i do n't know why their data is n't categorised though . 
  i never could have guessed it was suggesting it was self-inflicted if they did n't add that in to what she said too . 
  oh yeah i do n't want to overstate the case : https://youtu.be/9jhgvsjnznk?t=161 it 's just that he became better at working with people he disagreed with whereas the current leadership are like how he was . 
  ian paisley eventually became more reasonable than the current leadership of the dup and grew to have good working relationship with sinn f\u00e9in and friendship with martin mcguinness . 
  it 's a pretty shocking situation when you can genuinely say ni ( and now uk ) would be in a better situation if paisley was still alive and in charge of the dup . 
  well good , we 're arguing at cross purposes then . 
  my point is n't that radical change is impossible my point is that when you get into the specifics of something many iterations of improvements down the line there should be scepticism about your predictions . 
  musk has a specific vision for the future of intercity travel . 
  i can absolutely see us making dramatic improvements in that . 
  changes equivalent to a hyperloop in progress . 
  i see little reason to take it for granted that the hyperloop is where we end up . 
  it could easily be that his whole premise is wrong and the near future of transport is n't dramaticly faster but dramatically cheaper so there 's transport leaving every 15 minutes between major cities or dramatically more comfortable so you can get your work done/enjoy yourself during the journey . 
  or some combination of above different from the hyperloop . 
  he also has a specific vision of the mars mission that could be nothing like that . 
  we might even find martian sustainable life and decide that ethically we should not start a process that would contaminate that by sending colonists . 
  ( or at least we delay for decades while we find out more ),
