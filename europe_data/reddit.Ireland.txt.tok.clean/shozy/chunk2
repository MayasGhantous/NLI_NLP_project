  [ median ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median ) is different from the average that you 're thinking of ( and which your other sources reference ) which is the [ mean . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arithmetic_mean )  and there is no other source of income in my household ( i am still single ) . 
  [ `` median household income '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_household_income ) is `` the disposable income of an equivalent adult in a household in the middle of the income distribution in a year . '', 
  it takes account of [ household size . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/equivalisation ) so a household with 2 adults and one child under 14 would have their income divided by 1.8 for the purpose of calculating the statistic using the method that eurostat uses ( which is probably the one used here ) . 
  even still $ 17.5 k does seem low . 
  wikipedia ( which cites the oecd ) has the 2011 median german household income at [ $ 28,000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_household_income ) which would be around $ 22,100 . 
  or they deleted them and they have a habit of deleting controversial tweets soon after posting them so people knew to screenshot them . 
  they just need to say `` germany is not france '' or similar and the circle will be complete . 
   we pay 52 % of our income if you earn over $ 32,800 not to take away from your overall point but to be accurate ** your marginal rate ** is 52 % if you earn over $ 32,800 that is not the same as actually paying 52 % . 
  you pay 52 % on every * extra * euro you earn . 
  yeah it 's confusing language . 
  it just means that if your income is below 10,036 it 's exempt from the tax but if you earn more than 10,036 the first 10,036 you earn is * not * exempt from the tax . 
   70k + will be taxed more due to the social charge increase . 
  that actually is n't true . 
  no matter how high the income there is a tax decrease because of the way tax bands work . 
  extra income over $ 70044 had a combined tax rate of 48 % ( 41 % income tax + 7 % usc ) . 
  now it still has a combined tax rate of 48 % ( 40 % income tax + 8 % usc ) . 
  so no one is paying more income tax . 
  those high earners will get a decrease because of the change in bands and their income between $ 70044 and $ 33800 is 1 % lower than it was . 
  percentage-wise . 
  someone on 12012 is getting a 0.5 % decrease in tax . 
  working through the changes in a spreadsheet ( for a single paye person ) those on 70044 get a 1 % increase and only those earning more that ~ $ 150k get a lower than 0.5 percentage tax decrease . 
  edit : just to clarify this looks exclusively at the changes in income tax and usc and is n't incompatible with what / u/sunisue says . 
   foreign companies control nearly 100 % of ireland 's supermarket sector right now no they do n't . 
  the integrity report linked by / u/asenk - gives some more info . 
  http://www.integritywatch.eu/#mep125026 if you search for `` or more '' only 7 do n't have an upper limit so we could figure something out with that . 
  thanks for the links . 
  the [ integrity report ] ( http://www.integritywatch.eu/#mep97058 ) is very interesting and it lets you click on individual politicians . 
  i 've only taken a quick look but a whole lot of the `` outside income '' comes from political payments ( e.g. 
  for having been a minister ) . 
  looking in the uk some of the highest ones are ukip and conservative , no corruption there either though , the highest ukip ones are because they are currently local councillors at the same time as being meps . 
  why i aughta !, 
  you rapscallion !, 
  right we do more or less agree . 
  thanks for apologising , sorry if i overreacted . 
  i do n't think it 'll happen that fast . 
  to be profitable they 'd need to more than double their prices * and * continue to get money off the exchequer for infrastructure in 2016 . 
  what i suspect will happen is that we ( the irish state ) will spend all the money on getting irish water to a stage were all the massive infrastructure improvements that need to be made are done . 
  then if ff and/or fg or a similar party remain politically dominant then they will sell it off instead of keeping the profits for the exchequer or lowering the charge . 
  it could be 2024 or even later by the time this happens . 
  kind of cunt-ish to suggest i 'm na\u00efve based on a one line reply stating how things are right now when you 're not even saying i 'm wrong . 
  you ca n't have `` de facto privatisation '' , it 's 100 % owned by the state that is the definition of * not * privatised . 
  right now it 's a loss making publicly owned limited company that is n't allowed increase it 's prices until at least 2016 . 
  if we keep voting ff and fg yeah there 's a good chance it will eventually be privatised but not until after then . 
   also we 're semi-privatising our public water supply infrastructure though a company irish water . 
  irish water is 100 % state owned . 
  currently it is in no way privatised . 
   funny how they 're privatising it they 're not . 
  the state is a 100 % shareholder in irish water . 
  fixed it . 
  should have been 24 % against . 
  [ table two of this has that info since 2009 . 
  ] ( http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/pme/populationandmigrationestimatesapril2014/#.vdadk74jerw ) just from a quick look it seems there are slightly more female immigrants and a good bit more male emigrants in the period . 
  in ireland 's case it 's mostly because we had a construction boom which meant a lot of men went into the construction industry but not so many women and then a massive bust were we hardly built anything anymore . 
  iirc the gap is narrowing now that things are beginning to recover properly . 
  how are taxpayers taking on the risk ? 
  it 's wrong is how it 's bad . 
  unless you can explain how an institution buying stuff with money it creates can possibly make a real loss . 
  i start off with $ 1000 worth of assets . 
  i print $ 100 and buy something with it but then it turns out that thing is only worth $ 50 . 
  that means i now have $ 1050 worth of assets . 
  i 've made a `` loss '' on the investment but i have n't actually lost anything . 
  there 's effectively no limit to the amount of these `` losses '' a central bank can make . 
  they can have printed so much money that the person selling the risky investment does n't want that currency to buy it but we have the opposite problem right now . 
   that 's the deal . 
  if you lend money , you get the interest but take the risk of a default . 
  that 's what we should have done and not blow the monies into the arses of the banks . 
  that 's the deal and that 's what is moral perhaps but how does that help the economy right now ? 
  capitalism is n't moral . 
  if we want to get back to target inflation and help grow the eurozone economy then this is what needs to be done . 
  the only other way for the central bank to get the necessary amount of money into the economy without it going to the banks would be using governments directly but that would be monetary financing . 
   `` then the credit risks taken by private banks would be transferred to the central bank ** and therefore taxpayers without them getting anything in return , '' ** how !, 
  you reminded me of [ willie frazer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/willie_frazer )  in may 2012 , after seeing the italian flag being flown as part of a cultural event held in donaghmore 's st patrick 's primary school and mistaking it for the irish tricolour , frazer accused the school for 4-11 year old children of being `` the junior headquarters of sf/ira youth '' , stating on facebook that `` i wounder do they also train the children in how to use weapons , for it seems they can do what they wont . 
  [ sic ] '' concerned for the safety of students and the school 's reputation , teachers informed police of the accusations and photographs of the school posted by frazer were later removed from facebook . 
   i have no idea why it is often discussed per hour , there is n't a monthly minimum wage in ireland . 
  the law is an hourly minimum wage . 
  people in part time work are eligible for some welfare payments depending on their situation . 
  yes . 
  is this were you move the goalposts ? 
  keep in mind you said `` theory should be valid all the time in all cases no matter what '' . 
  what sort of argument would you accept ? 
  i already presented an argument against it in my first reply . 
   low inflation , stagnant wages and high unemployment would suggest that failed businesses are n't crowding out successful ones . 
  i do personally agree in this case . 
  but it can be argued . 
  to take an extreme example , of a law removing a freedom that overall makes people more free , it is illegal to sell yourself into slavery . 
  in theory if you 're perfectly free you should be free to make yourself unfree . 
  in practice though a law preventing that means that more people have more freedom than they would have . 
  some who are extremely anti-headscarf see their ban the same way . 
  they are preventing people from making themselves less free . 
  i think the suggestion is those pushing for the change in the law used that freedom argument but the same people will force the wearing of headscarfs and islam classes . 
   because theory should be valid all the time in all cases no matter what that just does n't happen in economics or any social science . 
  if you 're claiming your sources ' theories are right 100 % of the time i can guarantee you 're wrong !, 
  in fact right now it does n't happen in physics , our theories which accurately describe very large things contradict our theories that accurately describe very small things . 
  that does n't mean those theories are n't incredibly useful we just know we have an incomplete picture and have a whole lot of work still to do . 
   for example stimulus works , well it dint work , why it dint work ? 
  dint do enough , how much is enough ? 
  wee do n't know mainstream economics , even mainstream modern keynesianism does not say `` stimulus works '' . 
  it says `` under specific circumstances stimulus gives you more employment and growth '' .
