  they usually contend that stimulus did work compared to what employment and growth would be without the stimulus . 
  i do think some advocates of stimulus are overzealous . 
  they tend to act as if recovery without stimulus is always impossible which i think will be damaging to arguments for stimulus in the future . 
  they did n't all do that to such an extent that it increased sovereign debt to gdp ratios during the boom though in many countries they fell significantly . 
  so it is not at all inevitable that governments spend more money if they can . 
  in fact the german government could spend much more money very easily * right now * and many encourage them to do so but they are not doing so , they also could have spent massively more in 2012/2013 leading into the election but they did n't and there 's reason to think that would have lost them votes . 
   there are a ton of content about this so dont need to copy paste that here i 'm interested in why ** you ** hold your opinion . 
  i have read other people with your opinion and i found their arguments unconvincing but i want to give you a chance to convince me by asking why you hold those opinions . 
  if you 're telling me to go read someone else with similar opinions to you then is your answer that you hold your opinions because you have read sources that you trust give that opinion ? 
  if so that 's fair enough , but could you at least tell me why you trust those sources above the ones that disagree with your opinion ? 
  really hard to tell . 
  good chance the election wo n't be until 2016 and right now the polls are fine gael ( 28 % ) , sinn f\u00e9in ( 23 % ) , fianna f\u00e1il ( 18 % ) , labour ( 8 % ) , others/independents ( 23 % ) . 
  on top of that the current leader of fine gael ( and prime minister ) , enda kenny , will be just under 65 then and the current leader of sinn f\u00e9in , gerry adams will be 67 , i do n't think either of them will retire before then , but it 's possible . 
  right now the momentum is with fine gael as a small majority of people seem to think they 've done a good job , god help us , but 2016 marks 100 years since the 1916 rising against british rule which could give republican parties ( sinn f\u00e9in and to a lesser extent fianna f\u00e1il ) a boost . 
  who knows if it actually will or not though . 
  complicating things even further is that each of those three top parties would have a part of their base who would be strongly against going into government with either of the other two . 
  so the largest party might not be the ones who forms the government . 
  or we might have a repeat of what happened with the green party here were their leader promised he would n't lead them into government with fianna f\u00e1il hoping to gain votes , so he stood down and someone else lead the party into government with ff . 
  low inflation , stagnant wages and high unemployment would suggest that failed businesses are n't crowding out successful ones . 
  if those conditions are there why would failed businesses continuing be a major problem for the economy as a whole ? 
  they will be a problem when they eventually fail but by that time unemployment should be lower and inflation higher so even if their losses are higher it 'll be less of a problem . 
  similarly it is unlikely that increase government spending would crowd out private sector investment so long as unemployment is high and inflation is low . 
  governments failing to decrease their debts could be a problem but there 's no foregone conclusion that governments will spend significantly more just because they can . 
  in what way did printing money make japan the way it is ? 
  and in what way will printing money make europe like japan ? 
  their debt is now denominated in euro though . 
  if they changed currency and devalued all that would do is increase debt as a percentage of gdp . 
  they would not be able to get an agreement with creditors to change the denomination of the debt into an italian currency that they know italy wants to devalue as soon as they agree at least not without it being considered a default . 
  there are strong arguments for why italy should have never joined the euro in that article but that is not the same thing as leaving the euro . 
   but it 's still you who pays everyone pays . 
  everyone also pays for the transaction costs associated with cash . 
  counting , security , transport etc. 
  they are an internal cost to the business as opposed to an external cost like paying a fee to a credit card company but you 're still paying for them . 
  is republican a useful descriptor when talking to people from abroad ? 
  apart from the general meaning of not having a monarch , do n't the connotations of it change from country to country ? 
  when you stop doing bad things it gives you the * possibility * of not being bad from then on . 
  that is what i meant . 
  you claimed i meant something else . 
  my point actually has nothing to do with the distinction between could and can . 
  so yeah you 're still not understanding me . 
  if i had to guess it has nothing to do with reading ability though . 
  you 've made your mind up and for some reason this opinion is important to you , it would in some a way hurt you to let go of it or to admit to yourself that you 're wrong . 
  so you will see flaws in what i 'm saying no matter what i say . 
  you wo n't believe me but i 'm genuinely ** not ** interested in `` winning '' the argument in the sense you mean . 
  if i convince you of everything i say that means i have learnt nothing and i this is n't an insult but you are n't important to me . 
  if you convince me of something that means i have learnt something which means i have n't wasted my time . 
  if you do n't convince me of anything then i have learnt nothing and wasted a load of time for nothing . 
  time is n't sufficient for legitimacy but it is impossible to be legitimate while committing genocide . 
  hence the words that indicate possibility not certainty in my post `` could '' and `` can '' . 
   the english state 's oppression of the irish does n't delegitimize the english state , does it ? 
  it did at the time , yes . 
  i already very clearly suggested this in my previous post . 
   if it did , then surely the extermination of the american indian or the enslavement of millions of africans by european settlers in america , would also delegitimize the united state of america , would it not ? 
  it did , yes . 
   that is , of course , unless you would n't apply the same rules and principles to others as you have yourself . 
  i am neither an english person during their empire . 
  or an american during the era of `` manifest destiny '' . 
  so i can see you were too lazy to find something bad that the irish state has done . 
  in the past the irish state allowed child abuse to continue in forms pedophilic , neglectful and the sale of children . 
  we also put up with the almost effective enslavement of mothers of so called `` illegitimate children '' . 
  in the past that tainted the irish states legitimacy . 
  in the present , the treatment of refugees , our sometimes inhumane conditions for prisoners and our misogynistic abortion laws do taint the legitimacy of my state in my eyes . 
  but those things are no where near as bad as genocide and overall ireland , when you consider all we do for our people and our effect on the world is a legitimate state of which i am proud . 
  but if ireland was right now committing a genocide the rest would no longer matter . 
  any government doing that would be illegitimate as it would be against our constitution to start . 
  if the irish people voted to allow genocide then ** of course ** we would cease to be a legitimate nation in my eyes . 
  i would i hope work at recreating a legitimate ireland but that would n't make my state legitimate while committing genocide . 
  -- ** the genocides of the past certainly do not legitimise the genocides of the present . 
  ** obviously genocide and subjugation delegitimise every state that is doing them . 
  have you not thought about it for a second ? 
  if a nation stops doing those things they can become legitimate . 
  there is still a taint there and they must work to never forget the things their nation has done but they can gain legitimacy . 
  if the isis stopped murdering people and committing genocide then they could in theory become legitimate . 
  they 're acting desperate alright but i think it 'll end up being a no vote . 
  when it comes to casting the real ballot for radical change some people get nervous and vote for the status quo . 
  you said they support `` independent nationalism , for the people of the middle east . '', 
  are kurdish people not one of the `` people of the middle east '' ? 
  are israeli people who were born there not `` people of the middle east '' . 
  an irish national supporting the creation of an irish state in ireland is a legitimate goal . 
  an english national supporting the creation of an english state in england is a legitimate goal . 
  an irish national supporting the creation of an irish state that subjugates the english people and establishes a state controlling their land is ** not ** legitimate . 
  it does n't mean he 's not a nationalist but it means his goals are n't legitimate . 
  an english national supporting the creation of an english state that subjugates irish people and establishes a state controlling their land is ** not ** legitimate . 
  it does n't mean he 's not a nationalist but it means his goals are n't legitimate . 
  is my point clear now ? 
   no one respects the kurdish state . 
  mainly , because there 's no such thing to respect . 
  you probably mean the kurdish people . 
  no , i specifically chose the phrase kurdish state on purpose as a juxtaposition of islamic state . 
  how can you defend a movement based on their `` legitimate goal '' of `` independent nationalism '' when they are attempting to subjugate another movement who have that exact same `` legitimate goal '' ? 
  so if they 're so in favour of independent nationalism i am sure they are in favour of the state of israel then ? 
  also why are they not respecting the kurdish state ? 
  ahaha , using the army 's actions in northern ireland to justify staying part of the uk . 
  because that 's the type of army you want your soldiers to be part of . 
   they are fully legitimate in their goals . 
  could you name those legitimate goals ? 
   this linked article get 's this so absolutely wrong . 
  it is not the ecb who is owing anything in the target2 system . 
  the maastricht treaty clearly forbits that . 
  the article says : `` eurozone banks maintain accounts with their country 's central bank .
