  when an irish bank writes a cheque to a german bank , the target2 system deducts the irish bank 's account at the central bank of ireland and credits the german bank 's account at the bundesbank . 
  technically , the bundesbank incurs a new liability in the form of an increase in the value of the bundesbank account of the bank cashing the cheque but this is offset by a claim against the ecb which appears as an asset on the bundesbank 's balance sheet . '', 
  what part of that is against maastrict ? 
   of course , the secondary market is what i mean with buying government bonds directly . 
  that makes no sense , before you said :  if the ecb buys government bonds directly , then this will increase the shared liability even more . 
  and this directly violates the `` no bailout '' clause in the maastricht treaty . 
  the ecb already does and has always bought government bonds off the secondary market . 
  it 's a key mechanism by which ecb controls interest rates . 
  they 're called [ open market operations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open_market_operation ) . 
  how does it violate the `` no bailout clause '' ? 
  when the ecb buys debt that means governments owe it money , it does n't mean it owes governments anything . 
   so it is effectively doing qe . 
  yes effectively it is . 
  -- for your convenience here is article 123 of the tfeu which is the article that prohibits monetary financing , emphasis added by me :  article 123  ( ex article 101 tec )  1 . 
  overdraft facilities or any other type of credit facility with the european central bank or with the central banks of the member states ( hereinafter referred to as `` national central banks '' ) in favour of union institutions , bodies , offices or agencies , central governments , regional , local or other public authorities , other bodies governed by public law , or public undertakings of member states shall be prohibited , * as shall the purchase * *** directly from them *** * by the european central bank or national central banks of debt instruments . 
  paragraph 1 shall not apply to publicly owned credit institutions which , in the context of the supply of reserves by central banks , shall be given the same treatment by national central banks and the european central bank as private credit institutions . 
  and since you referenced it here is article 125 the `` no bailout clause ''  article 125  ( ex article 103 tec )  1 . 
  the union shall not be liable for or assume the commitments of central governments , regional , local or other public authorities , other bodies governed by public law , or public undertakings of any member state , without prejudice to mutual financial guarantees for the joint execution of a specific project . 
  a member state shall not be liable for or assume the commitments of central governments , regional , local or other public authorities , other bodies governed by public law , or public undertakings of another member state , without prejudice to mutual financial guarantees for the joint execution of a specific project . 
  the council , on a proposal from the commission and after consulting the european parliament , may , as required , specify definitions for the application of the prohibitions referred to in articles 123 and 124 and in this article . 
  -- the most important question i have for you though is : ** how is germany already paying italy 's debt ? 
   so germany is already paying this debt . 
  absolutely not !, 
  hans-werner sinn [ ( who gets it wrong ) ] ( http://www.voxeu.org/article/there-hidden-eurozone-bailout ) does n't even make that claim . 
  he claims that the loans are now owed to germany and if the emu broke up ** then ** the german taxpayer could end up having to bailout the bundesbank . 
  that 's a massively different situation to the one you 're suggesting exists . 
  so long as everyone continues to pay their debts and remain part of the euro germany will not be paying out a single cent !, 
   if the ecb buys government bonds directly that will not happen and that is not what the fed or the bank of england did . 
  quantitative easing is still buying assets on the secondary market they just have longer maturities than what central banks normally do . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quantitative_easing you may have noticed the ecb already does that but they also `` sterilised '' those purchases . 
  [ this explains it ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/04/what-does-the-ecbs-sterilization-program-do/ ), 
  we 're edging closer and closer to deflation and you 're worried about hyperinflation !, 
  would n't even need to be across the eu . 
  if they only borrowed to do projects that would in the long term yield a profit within germany that would still help everyone just by spending money now . 
   you ( and italy ) helped greece/spain/portugal / ireland . 
  except in greece 's case exclusively using ** loans ** , which if paid back in full means the creditor nations make a profit . 
  how much does the german tax payer pay to bailout other countries : ** zero ** . 
  in theory contributing to the bailout fund should raise their own interest rates and that 's how they 'd have to pay but that just has ** not ** happened and they continue to be at record lows . 
   then probably the piigs , then more and more european nations . 
  as imperfect as ireland 's political system is , it does shut out the extremes . 
  there are currently no credible authoritarian movements in ireland and there were none even during the worst of the crisis . 
  firstly it 's an opinion piece , so that kind of error is the responsibility of the writer not the paper as a whole you are n't representing the whole story either though . 
  we 've got room here so lets get the entire exchange you are quoting . 
   [ ... ] anna sazonova : yes , it has a different name now . 
   everybody is talking about nationalism in ukraine nowadays . 
  however , we are concerned about a different situation , namely the growth of nationalistic sentiments in kazakhstan , in the south of that country in particular . 
  in our view the acting president , mr nazarbayev is the main restraining factor here . 
  an adequate perception by kazakhs of russian political rhetoric is also an issue . 
  this is obvious from the internet , from the activities of public organisations and in personal conversations . 
   our question is should we expect developments in kazakhstan to follow the ukrainian scenario should mr nazarbayev leave his post ? 
  is there any strategy designed to prevent this ? 
  we have some proposals ; we would like to join this work , if possible . 
  what are the prospects for eurasian integration ? 
   and on a personal note , i would like to say you look well , this cardigan suits you very well . 
  thank you . 
   vladimir putin : so this is a cardigan ? 
  ( laughs ) ok . 
  thank you for the compliment . 
   here is what i can say about kazakhstan . 
  it is our closest strategic ally and partner . 
  first , president nazarbayev is alive and well , and , thank god , has no intention of resigning ; however , being the wise and experienced leader that he is , he is always concerned about the future of his country . 
   as for some individual comments on the internet and some discussions with citizens of kazakhstan -- naturally , people are different and they may express different views . 
  in population that country is about ten times smaller than russia , its population is about 15 million , but by european standards this is a large country . 
  however , i am convinced that a vast majority of the citizens of kazakhstan favour stronger ties with russia . 
  we see this and we know it . 
   as you may know , mr nazarbayev is a very wise leader , i believe he is the wisest on the post-soviet space , and he would never go against the will of his people . 
  he can feel what his people expect of him . 
  therefore , everything that has been done lately -- largely due to his talent of an organiser and his political expertise -- is all in the interests of kazakhstan as a state . 
   i already said that he has performed a unique feat : he has created a state on a territory where there has never been a state . 
  the kazakhs never had a state of their own , and he created it . 
  in this sense , he is a unique person on the post-soviet space and in kazakhstan . 
  however , i would like to repeat , that this is not about him , but about the sentiments of the people , of the vast majority of society . 
   so now , we are working to create the customs union , the common economic space and the eurasian union -- which , by the way , was his idea . 
  i have to admit that he was the one who came up with the idea , not i. 
  and we are helping ; we got involved in this effort and are bringing it to a logical close . 
  philosophers know where this idea of a eurasian union came from and how it developed , who supported it in russia . 
  the kazakhs picked it up proceeding from the understanding that it is good for their economy , it helps them stay within the so-called ` greater russian world ' , which is part of world civilisation , it is good for the development of their industry , of advanced technologies and so forth . 
  i am convinced that this will continue in the same vein for the mid - and long historical term . 
  http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/22864 the most complete version of nazarbayev 's later response i can find is :  `` if the rules set forth in the agreement are not followed , kazakhstan has a right to withdraw from the eurasian economic union . 
  i have said this before and i am saying this again . 
  kazakhstan will not be part of organizations that pose a threat to our independence . 
  our independence is our dearest treasure , which our grandfathers fought for . 
  first of all , we will never surrender it to someone , and secondly , we will do our best to protect it , '' the president said . 
   many say that kazakhstan will be discriminated in the eurasian union , but `` that 's not true . 
  when the presidents of kazakhstan , russia and belarus get together to make decisions , if any one of the three is against something , the decision is not made . 
  this is called consensus . 
  if i do not like their decision , i will speak up against it , and it will not be adopted . 
  this means that we all have equal rights , `` nursultan nazarbayev said . 
   `` in the eurasian economic commission , there are three representatives from each country and three vice-prime-ministers . 
  they also make their decisions together . 
  the same applies to meetings of the heads of governments , '' the president concluded . 
  on the face of it you are i think correct that nazarbayev himself is being misrepresented as feeling threatened and as threatening to leave the eurasian union . 
  it looks like what he meant is `` we are not being threatened , i would n't allow us to be part of an organisation that threatened our independence . '', 
  however just looking at the face of it might miss subtext and context . 
  why did putin and/or his handlers allow that question ? 
  particularly why this format which specifically couches kazakh opposition to russia in the context of ukrainian opposition to russia ? 
  why does nazarbeyev response leave room to be misinterpreted as responding to a threat ? 
  my answers would be that the subtext and context is that it is a fully deniable threat . 
  the threat is towards those who would wish to depose nazarbeyev . 
  the suggestion is that without nazarbeyev there would be no kazakhstan but he purposely leaves out the conclusion of the threat of what would happen if nazarbeyev was no longer in power .
