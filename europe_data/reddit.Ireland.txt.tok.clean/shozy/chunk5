  yes he mentions the sentiments of the majority is what matters ** but ** only after clearly stating that those sentiments are pro-russian . 
  this is , i think , to make it sound like he respects the will of the majority but the threat underneath is that he only respects those sentiments . 
  nazarbeyev 's response , which i would n't be surprised if it was prepared in conjunction with putin 's response to the question , is designed to be balanced for the kazakh audience . 
  it gives him a chance to stand up to putin in front of nationalists but at the same time attempts to allay their fears of the eurasian union . 
  it says at the same time a nationalist `` russia ca n't bully us '' and a pro-russian `` russia is n't trying to and wo n't bully us '' . 
  a pegged scottish pound would not have the same consequences as being part of the euro . 
  in the case of a crisis disproportionately affecting scotland compared with the remaining uk they could ( and would probably be forced to ) break/soften the peg and devalue . 
  i would n't recommend going to germany , they arrested me just for eating a b\u00fcrger !, 
  yeah i got your meaning and do n't disagree with your point , it 's just i think that 's being way too loose with the terminology because the terminology made direct reference to ireland being part of it . 
  the name united kingdom comes from the [ acts of union of 1800 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acts_of_union_1800 ) which created the [ united kingdom of great britain and ireland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_kingdom_of_great_britain_and_ireland ) the rest of what you say is true , it just is inaccurate to say it was n't part of the uk since without ireland it would n't be called the uk in the first place . 
  i do n't agree on either point . 
  russia can cause much more economic damage through their control of the gas supply to europe and also destabilisation of eastern european states . 
  china is much bigger and more powerful economically but they have two things making them less of a threat . 
  firstly their economy depends on exports , that makes them less able to wage economic warfare . 
  secondly their economy is key to their political stability that is n't as much the case in russia were putin has been able to shift blame for poor economic performance to the west and * gain * popularity . 
  on economic threats being the most important in the modern world i do n't see the evidence for that . 
  sanctions are continually undermined and real sanctions that damage the intended target hurt the one doing the sanctions even before counter sanctions . 
  seems like china is supposedly hitler because somehow they 're the greater threat to `` europe 's '' interests ? 
  putin 's cooperation outside eastern europe matters to the us . 
  he never explained why it should matter more to europeans than eastern europe . 
  did he miss the memo were much of eastern europe is in the eu ? 
  did he miss the fact that some of those states have sizeable russian populations . 
  but europe ( which actually means western europe ... which actually just means uk , france and germany ) is supposed to do a deal which would require legitimising russia 's annexation of crimea ? 
  could n't let that stand so here 's a fixed and more up to date ( 2012 ) version i just made : http://imgur.com/kehvkyq [ here 's the source data ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?query=bookmark_ds-057102_qid_5b1f4db9_uid_-3f171eb0&amp;layout=tenure,l,x,0;geo,l,y,0;incgrp,l,z,0;hhtyp,l,z,1;time,c,z,2;indicators,c,z,3;&amp;zselection=ds-057102indicators,obs_flag;ds-057102hhtyp,total;ds-057102time,2012;ds-057102incgrp,total;&amp;rankname1=hhtyp_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname2=time_1_0_-1_2&amp;rankname3=incgrp_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname4=indicators_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname5=tenure_1_2_0_0&amp;rankname6=geo_1_2_0_1&amp;sortr=asc_1&amp;rstp=&amp;cstp=&amp;rdch=&amp;cdch=&amp;rdm=true&amp;cdm=true&amp;footnes=false&amp;empty=false&amp;wai=false&amp;time_mode=none&amp;time_most_recent=false&amp;lang=en&amp;cfo=%23%23%23%2c%23%23%23.%23%23%23 ), 
  we change our constitution all the time http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amendments_to_the_constitution_of_ireland#list_of_amendments_and_referendums, 
  she does not have irish/european citizenship and she did not have the necessary visas or money to travel to the uk . 
  http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/woman-in-abortion-case-tells-of-suicide-attempt-1.1901256 usually what you say is what happens which is a big part of why politicians are able to go so long ignoring the issue . 
  if it is ever to be changed it will have to be by referendum because the equal right to life of the `` unborn '' is in our constitution which can only be changed by referendum . 
  but only the government can put forward things for referendum . 
  so according to you eurosceptics are eurosceptic because they want control over taxation taken away from member states ... 
  yeah , though i was wrong that all eu countries will do it . 
  france wo n't . 
  [ here 's a good article about why it makes sense to . 
  ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_edgy_optimist/2014/06/france_gdp_the_nation_won_t_include_drugs_and_prostitution_in_its_calculations.html ) tl ; dr wether you measure them or not , they 're part of the economy . 
  yes them growing is bad but there are already things that grow gdp that are bad and things that shrink gdp but are good . 
  i support it . 
  the top argument against it is that it relies on best guesses which is true , but hopefully statistics agencies will get better at that as time goes on . 
  they are , or soon will be , counted in every eu countries ' gdp . 
  it 's part of new international standards for what should be counted in gdp . 
   neither ireland nor malta come near to the wealth of the uk news to me . 
  by gross national income per capita ireland is as wealthy as the uk . 
  by gdp per capita we 're a good bit wealthier but that 's not as accurate in the irish context . 
  that 's not how i read the article . 
  he 's not saying we should n't remember the events he 's criticising how it 's being remembered . 
  he seems to agree with what you say but disagree that that is what is happening :  the most sensible commemoration of any war is not to repeat it . 
  hence , presumably , the constant references by this week 's celebrants to `` drawing lessons '' and `` lest we forget '' . 
  but this is mere cliche if no lessons are then drawn , or if drawn are then forgotten . 
  his accusation seems to be that these are celebrations in disguise not real commemorations . 
  that while the language of a commemoration is used now and again there 's no talk of what the lessons actually are , what the mistakes that we should n't repeat actually are nor is their any talk about how current events could relate to a repetition of those mistakes . 
  i have n't been following the commemorations very closely so i ca n't speak to the truth of his portrayal of them but it seems plausible from what i have seen . 
  reminds me of this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovak_police_training_explosives_incident, 
  hang on , neoliberalism most certainly ** does ** say that price controls never improve things !, 
  no it 's not against all regulation always but it is absolutely against all price controls . 
   i reject the prospect of the first one doing it , particularly against a backdrop of an election notable for the rise of eurosceptic parties . 
  i accept that junker is less legitimate than a properly elected potc for the reasons you give but my point is he has as much or more than the ones chosen by the council . 
  and it opens the way for the next election to provide full legitimacy for the next potc . 
  really i wish junker was n't so shit , i think there 'd be much less fuss if he was good . 
   well this could be me in my own uk bubble , but i 'd never heard of any of the broadcasters . 
  the bbc carried at least one of them , but chose to show it on bbc parliament . 
  as i said they did n't do nothing is all i 'm saying and i do n't think they chose to be so boring . 
  some of the topics could have been interesting it 's just they seemed to all agree with each other that the stuff people think is bad , is bad and stuff people think is good is good . 
   well , they ticked all the boxes so they can tell the people that they should have been paying closer attention while i accept they need to do more , there is an element of truth to that . 
  people should be paying closer attention . 
   telling this to the heads of national government ? 
  against a backdrop of the rise of eurosceptic parties , it 's not a convincing argument that it 's the right thing to do . 
  it 's the only method of argumentation they have that will get any attention though . 
  by doing this there 's no excuse for the media not taking the candidates seriously at the next election . 
  and as i 've said the heads of governments can turn around and say no . 
  and i think this disagreement in the council is typical of the cameron brand of moderate `` eurosceptic '' except not really eurosceptic . 
  ignore the eu until something is about to be agreed and only then try to get it changed and then blame the eu for that not working . 
   nigel farage more salesman than statesman but yes a very sad state of affairs that he counts as good at politics . 
   er , maybe . 
  i chose anti-democratic because i see it as an attempt to disguise an undemocratic process as a democratic one , and use its supposed democratic status to justify a grab for power . 
  the process itself is n't undemocratic though . 
  it 's very close to being the same process to how prime ministers are usually chosen . 
  the people elect a parliament and then parliament elects a prime minister , usually from the biggest party . 
  you would n't call that process undemocratic would you ? 
   more so in the european parliament ? 
  i 'm not sure . 
  maybe . 
  i 'd say certainly . 
  the things people care the most about , education , healthcare , taxes , social welfare , defence are all primarily national . 
  other things like migration the parliament ca n't do anything about either . 
  also even with those many national parliaments * are * suffering from the same lack of engagement the eu parliament suffers from . 
   there 's still the ability of the candidates to sell themselves to the people - explain why they are the most credible and trustworthy and competent person to be the president of the european commission . 
  they had i think 4 or 5 debates but they did n't get advertised much in the media . 
  so it 's not like they did n't try at all . 
  they were widely available if you knew about them and went looking for them . 
  they were * incredibly * boring though and i say that as someone who occasionally puts on a stream of my parliament when there 's nothing else on . 
   i think the european groupings system is absurd . 
  yeah that 's certainly in need of reform . 
   i think establishing popular support for the principle of an elected president is the first course of action . 
  they announced their plans before the election and then had the election and the parties in favour of their plan maintained control . 
  in my mind they have no better way to establish if they may continue with the plan available to them , that is how democracy has always worked in practice . 
  representative democracy is not rule by opinion poll and focus group . 
   that 's a step towards federalism the democratically elected national governments have also had plenty of chances to say they will not support their plan and they still could oppose them and they will continue to have that opportunity next time . 
  for that reason it is not a step towards federalism . 
  the council has n't lost any power , they just did n't work together to provide an alternative that they were all happy with . 
   i think they 're approaching this whole thing wrong i see no difference between how they 're approaching things and how national parties are approaching things . 
  i agree it 's not good enough but i think too much is blamed on `` europe '' when it 's a failure of national governments .
