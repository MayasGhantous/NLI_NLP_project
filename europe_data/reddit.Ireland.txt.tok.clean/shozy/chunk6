  i also think part of the problem is our low expectations of pretty much all the institutions vital to a healthy democracy . 
  the media , the politicians ( national and european ) , even the courts . 
  now the bigger part of the problem is those low expectations prove accurate so much of the time but why would an honest sensitive person ever become a politician in the current climate ? 
  might sound nitpicky but i think you mean to use the word undemocratic rather than anti-democratic ? 
  in other words , an absence of democracy rather than something that attempts to take away democracy . 
  i do agree with some of what you 're saying . 
  but a big part of the trouble is much of what the eu parliament does ** is ** distant from the people . 
  it is mostly very boring . 
  that 's not to say it 's not important but you 're not going to get voters excited by it . 
  `` check out this report on ` promoting free movement by simplifying the acceptance of certain public documents ' we 've been looking through ! '', 
  does n't make for very exciting election literature . 
  that 's not to say i disagree that they need to engage more , they should also be running more under their european grouping not their national party and that should be fairly fixed what grouping they 're in before the election not after . 
   but it 's the wrong way to go about it . 
  i think they did n't have a choice . 
  the national governments did n't confirm or reject their idea and as you pointed out the national parties control the election campaigns . 
  there is a problem there ** but ** pushing ahead with their plan is the best course of action . 
  yes this time their candidate does not have the full democratic legitimacy but he has more democratic legitimacy than the last president of the commission and if they stick with this method the next potc will have even more legitimacy because the spitzen candidates will get more attention . 
  if they gave in to the council then next election they 'd be back at square one . 
  could you explain what is anti-democratic about the attitude ? 
  how should they proceed that would be more democratic ? 
  the meps should break their promise ? 
  i 'm not an expert and it 's a complex subject however to do it exactly like you describe would ( according to the ecb ) be against article 123 of the treaty of the functioning of the european union . 
  that is were the deposits come into it , allowing the ecb to sterilise all these operations so there 's no extra money after the operations that would n't exist if the operations had never taken place . 
  from the context of my post it should have been clear that ` purchasing power ' meant ability to buy these government bonds . 
  the ecb can expand its balance sheet and create money without sterilising just not for buying these bonds . 
  if i tried to describe exactly how it works i 'd make too many mistakes and would obscure my point but the slightly less simplified but still simplified point that i made is : the ecb has the ability to buy bonds without creating extra money compared to doing nothing because it has deposits not because of anyone 's taxes . 
  edit : this post might sound a bit unnecessarily confrontational in places , sorry if it does . 
  my earlier post did probably need the further clarification . 
  no it does n't come from * anyone 's * taxes , german , italian or otherwise !, 
  the ecb gets its purchasing power from the deposits left with it by banks . 
  why would `` the pro-eu mob '' be the ones down voting you for being against the council ? 
  the european council is basically a summit of eu heads of government . 
  as such , it is democratically elected on the national level . 
  most pro-eu people want more power taken away from the council and given to the parliament . 
  most anti-eu people want power given back to the heads of government which means more power to the council . 
  well spotted . 
  then he did break protocol and will face the full punishment that entails ( none ) . 
  no one who is not a subject is required to follow royal protocol . 
  it actually is part of our unhealthy attitude towards drink . 
  we do n't consume the most amount of alcohol in europe but the trouble is ( as a general rule ) we tend to binge drink . 
  so generally no single drink with lunch . 
  i just did a quick google to confirm what i 'm saying : [ binge drinking ] ( http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1019514.shtml ) [ total alcohol ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/11/23/article-2065444-0eebdb8d00000578-32_468x381.jpg ), 
  it 's fairly widespread worldwide . 
  a relation of mine was joking about how it 's a luxury item and they constantly refer to it as kerrygold * grass-fed * butter over in vancouver . 
  i think he 's suggesting he had beer at lunch because he was with a british man . 
  seems to be a normal thing you do that we do n't normally do . 
  ( though he could have not drank at all , but some people consider it rude not to have a drink when the person they 're with is ... or at least that 's the excuse ), 
  it 's well known , or should be for anyone here who paid attention , in ireland because we had 2 referendums on the treaty . 
  the lisbon treaty did that already !, 
  it just has n't come into effect yet . 
  you can watch it here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=rtjstmirtec#t=49958, 
  i was speaking more generally about why an economic collapse would n't explain a low result . 
  it 's as a percentage of gdp so the collapse in itself should n't explain it . 
  in fact you 'd normally expect the percentage to go up because gdp is down and there are more unemployed people claiming benefits . 
  here 's a version of the quote , weston 's version replaces the word mohammedanism with islamism :  `` how dreadful are the curses which mohammedanism lays on its votaries !, 
  besides the fanatical frenzy , which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog , there is this fearful fatalistic apathy . 
  the effects are apparent in many countries . 
  improvident habits , slovenly systems of agriculture , sluggish methods of commerce , and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the prophet rule or live . 
  a degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement ; the next of its dignity and sanctity . 
  the fact that in mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property ` either as a child , a wife , or a concubine ` must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of islam has ceased to be a great power among men . 
  individual moslems may show splendid qualities . 
  weston 's version leaves out this next line :  thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the queen ; all know how to die ; but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it . 
  skips to here :  no stronger retrograde force exists in the world . 
  far from being moribund , mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith . 
  it has already spread throughout central africa , raising fearless warriors at every step ; and were it not that christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science ` the science against which it had vainly struggled ` the civilisation of modern europe might fall , as fell the civilisation of ancient rome . '', 
  do n't really think it 's relevant that it 's from churchill . 
  here 's another quote from the same book :  the qualities of mongrels are rarely admirable , and the mixture of the arab and negro types has produced a debased and cruel breed , more shocking because they are more intelligent than the primitive savages . 
  i mean churchill was definitely the man the uk needed as a war time leader in ww2 and deserves praise for that but he was also definitely a british supremacist . 
   more fighters are likely to have travelled from ireland to join the rebels in the syrian civil war per capita than any other european country . 
  that 's 26 fighters !, 
  you 'll get in a lot of trouble for that northern irish one !, 
  that 's completely unrepresentative of northern ireland !, 
  ... you need [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/19/uvfvolunteers.jpeg ) as well , * now * it 's balanced and representative !, 
  i 'd say yes . 
  it 's certainly something that needs to be fixed . 
  i gather you 're looking for hard data . 
  except for [ this , ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/199237/statistical_release_gypsy_and_traveller_caravan_count_-_jan_2013.pdf ) ( which i already linked to you as an example of the use of gypsy ) , i ca n't really help with that . 
  apart from hard statistics you 'll find examples like beiie-and-sebastian about travellers camping illegally . 
  but on the other side of things you 'll see examples like this : https://twitter.com/lazare76/status/452139802075594753/photo/1/large that 's a local councillor in ireland 's letter to her constituents celebrating a `` victory for the community '' that a traveller accommodation scheme is not going ahead in their area . 
  sorry did n't mean to suggest ignorance on your part , i meant `` you '' as in `` one can see why if one looks at ... '' , but i never use `` one '' in that sense . 
  besides from doing a bit of googling and it mentions it in the wiki , even though gypsies is n't really pc it seems to be a term still in official use in the uk . 
  usually they 're not referred to as gypies because that 's more associated with just [ romani ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romani_people ) and not [ irish travellers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_travellers ) you can see why if you look at the [ etymology of gypsy ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gypsy#etymology ) and you can also see one reason why it 's not pc to describe romani people , it suggests they 're originally from egypt . 
  personally i think the question `` are travellers a problem ? '', 
  is similar to `` are african-americans a problem ? '' . 
  ( i use that term and not ` black people ' , on purpose to be specific ) and i hope it 's immediately apparent that that second question does n't sound right !, 
  the problem is with the question . 
  they are not a `` problem '' a people are not a `` problem '' they ** have ** a problem . 
  to describe a group of people as `` a problem '' is a scary thing to do . 
  problems are things to be fixed . 
  they seem like rather distinctive eyes . 
  this is slightly clearer than op 's pic http://i.imgur.com/q8usqi7.png if you zoom in he has a slight squint in his left eye in both pictures and in the case of the video it appears to be his resting face though that 's still only a few seconds . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxvvplej8s0&amp;t=50s so as i 've said taking that in conjunction with the other similarities means i do think i can conclude it 's the same person . 
  compare his choice of uniform , equipment and how he 's wearing it to his friends in the video , or the guy on the left behind him in the photo . 
  i think the opposite of you . 
  look at his eyes and shape of his nose along with the clothes and equipment and how he wears it . 
  i think it 's the same man but that that is n't really evidence of it not being separate groups or on it 's own evidence of a single benefactor . . supposing he 's not russian , why * would n't * someone who helped make crimea part of russia then go on to try to do the same in other parts of ukraine ? 
  now suppose he bought all that equipment himself . 
  the kind of person who does that * wants * to be part of the action , i doubt they 'd stay at home where nothing is happening . 
  that 's not to say that i do n't think russians and russian funding is involved . 
  i think they definitely are , just that this guy being in two different places is n't evidence of that and taken on it 's own him having that equipment is n't evidence of that .
