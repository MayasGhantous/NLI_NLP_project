  the water hoses idea is clearly from captain philips not signs . 
  the glasses of water placed around the boat and issuing the crew baseball bats is the tactic they 're keeping in reserve . 
  that 's not entirely true http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_foreign_and_security_policy and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_security_and_defence_policy my understanding is neither of these will come into play in this situation , but there is an extremely limited ( i think it does n't even explicitly cover territorial defence ) common european foreign policy . 
  no it 's not an organ of the neo-nazi party with the same name : http://www.rferl.org/info/ukrainian/197.html it seems they are actually funded by the us congress . 
  i find it funny that you simultaneously are saying it 's petty but you 're taking an absolute position about it and angry that some people do n't agree . 
  soz about the empire being gone . 
  and there was never much tin in ireland which is why we 're so angry about the name !, 
  i know !, 
  sorry if my tone suggested i was making a correction rather than an observation . 
  it 's hard to not make it seem that you 're not trying to correct or score a point over someone on reddit since so much of it is people trying to make themselves seem cleverer then whoever they 're replying to !, 
  ok setting aside the whole debate about migrants and the specific content . 
  i 'd like to understand why you think that about this video and i think we could have a conversation about that without it descending into insults . 
  what in that video displays a concern for the truth ? 
  it condenses a dozen or so videos into the space of 6 minutes . 
  do you think it 's possible to convey the whole truth ( or enough of the truth even ) of all these separate incidents into such a short timespan ? 
  it adds background music to several videos to signal to viewers how they should feel instead of letting them make their own minds up . 
  do you think that 's consistent with a concern for the truth ? 
  it does not provide any background information , or say what happened after any of the videos , they 're presented without context . 
  you agree with what the video says but try to divorce that from your analysis of it . 
  do you genuinely believe this was a good example of communicating the truth ? 
  or is it just that you feel you know that it 's the truth because of your own prior knowledge and opinions and this conforms to that ? 
  try to think of it from the perspective of someone without your knowledge and opinion . 
  your video also shows that those anti-migrant protesters were covered though . 
  on the one hand do n't take this subreddit as representative of europeans . 
  but on the other hand you should n't have put europeans on a pedestal like that unfortunately all humans are capable of being unreasonable and/or heartless . 
   remember the video of that migrant who throw himself , his wife and his baby onto a train track and the media called it police brutality ? 
  nope . 
  i do n't remember any media calling it police brutality . 
  i remember a big deal being made about a bbc video that was up for half a day suggesting the police were involved in `` a push and shove , '' that somehow ended up with the refugees on the train track which was taken down after more information showed that they got it wrong came out . 
   no idea why scotland even want independence . 
  england pays for them . 
  if they went independent they 'd have to cut back on a lot of things or introduce tuition fees , etc. 
  like england . 
  here 's an analogy : no idea why timmy even wants independence . 
  his parents pay for him . 
  if he went independent he 'd have to cut back on going out with his friends and pay rent/a mortgage , etc. 
  like his parents . 
  i 'm not saying i think scotland should or should n't be independent since i 'm not scottish but i hated the financial dependence argument . 
  the question was , to extend my analogy , did they feel like they 're in a successful marriage with the rest of britain which means compromise and a common way forward . 
  or did they feel like a parent - child relationship which means they need to move out and make their own decisions for themselves and yes , pay their own way . 
  yeah i doubt he would either it 's just funny ( / strange ) that it 's possible . 
  unless the politicians change their mind about letting the people decide at any stage , including after the referendum . 
  so greece should kick itself out of the euro ? 
  following proper procedure it needs a unanimous vote to decrease ez membership too , possibly two unanimous votes . 
  one to change to rules so there is actually a mechanism to do it and one to actually do it . 
  not following proper procedure , i.e. 
  where we are right now . 
  it 's all up to the ecb governing council . 
  [ this ] ( https://medium.com/bull-market/the-grexit-mechanism-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-the-euro-1807229b418c ) explains it way better than i could . 
  trouble is , those are the exact words isis wants him to use too . 
  i would n't mind if he 'd just shut up and get on with it . 
  then sure brag about it if it 's successful . 
  saying this nonsense now just helps isis frame it as a holy war between them and the west , instead of a campaign oppressing and killing the local population including fellow muslims in the most horrible ways possible . 
  [ birmingham ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jan/11/fox-news-steven-emerson-birmingham-muslims ), 
  in fairness , the referendum made no sense but it was set up in a way which ensured that somehow a yes vote made even less sense . 
  nobody knew what would happen with a yes vote either because the offer they were voting on had already expired . 
  it seems to have been , vote yes and we 'll negotiate a deal that we ** are n't ** going to implement so we 'll have an election , which we 'll probably win because we 'd still have 40 % + of the vote . 
  so then we 're back at square one because we have a new `` mandate . '', 
  or vote no and we 'll negotiate a deal that we ** will ** implement . 
  ( apparently even if it involves more austerity than any deal previously made public . ), 
   maybe we should give them a call and ask if it 's ok if we come over and burn a few bits of swords down ? 
  only a few bits ? 
  not the whole place ?!, 
  you monster !, 
   let the eu first clean up the mess in calais instead of turning a blind eye to it . 
  why should it ? 
  seems like it 's good for the rest of the eu to ignore it . 
  no one else has to spend money enforcing calais and the uk ends up with more than its quota illegally anyway , perfect . 
  ( / partially joking ), 
  included in the price at the shelf/on the label . 
  in america the prices on the shelf do n't include taxes . 
  `` national '' would be a better word to use since it 's clear no matter what the context . 
   there are laws and regulations which neither germany nor greece can change . 
  which ones ? 
  i do n't think of any laws are regulations that ca n't be ignored just like the `` no bailout clause '' or the fiscal regulations . 
  or the supposed `` laws and regulations '' against quantitative easing which i 'd only hear about from german economists . 
  heck a close examination of the limited ela support being provided by the ecb to greek banks right now seems contrary to what we were being told the laws and regulations were 2 weeks ago . 
  centre-right german politicians and economists with an agenda always seem to have some law or regulation they can point to so they can claim that their way is just the way things have to be . 
  i 'm not a fan of tsipras but i 'm even less of a fan of the centre-right consensus that seems to have emerged as the controlling power of the eu ( my own government are part of it now ) which has forced this outcome and which says paying back creditors is always * the * overriding moral concern but talk of morality goes out the window when it comes to deciding austerity measures . 
  i 'm not just referring to the negotiations here i 'm going back to the very start when any reasonable analysis of greek debt showed there was no reasonable level of austerity on its own could solve greece 's problem . 
  they might prefer to resign so they do n't need to implement the austerity measures themselves . 
  you mean : cue : dramatic music from critical scene from a major hollywood blockbuster ( for the 3rd time ) higgs : carefully puts 1kg weight on a precision scale * space for ad break * cue : dramatic music from critical scene from a major hollywood blockbuster ( for the 4th time ) narrator : before the break we saw how professor higgs was on the brink of making an amazing discovery higgs : carefully puts 1kg weight on a precision scale narrator : and this way , professor higgs has proven that gravity does indeed exist .

  not only had he discovered that gravity exists but that on this planet that it is about 9.8 n/kg strong . 
  * space for ad break *, 
  sure they 'd like to help greece out but if they cut their debt just because they face the apocalypse then the other periphery states wo n't do enough to prevent apocalyptic situations in their states . 
  and that 's how the zombie apocalypse started . 
  their reasoning would be that lots of people only read titles and neither click in to comments or the link . 
  i think something i read said that it is true for the majority of reddit users but i ca n't find it so i ca n't back that up . 
  you have poor reading comprehension and do n't understand the concept of an example so there 's not much point trying to argue with you but whatever i 'm bored ... 
  in the context of charlie hebdo actually : `` 27 percent of respondents said they agreed with the statement : `` i have some sympathy for the motives behind the charlie hebdo attacks in paris . '', 
  so the other question clearly is n't just in that context or else 27 % would have agreed with it not just 11 % . 
  if you were any good at reading comprehension you could have made an argument around that suggesting the real number is above 11 % but really you just wanted to call someone pathetic because it lets you feel like you 're a big hero fighting the war against islamists and their apologists . 
  it 's us versus them and because i made a technical point about the broadness of that statement in the poll i 'm one of `` them '' and you have to save europe from me . 
  i ca n't speak for what ever mod chose the flair but i think they mean : the claim that increased numbers of refugees has started to `` jolt jewish leaders and journalists into an examination of dangers inherent in the mass migration '' has an unreliable source . 
  in that context partisan and unreliable seem close to synonyms to me but if you disagree that 's fair enough . 
  my main point though is that it does n't seem like it 's suggesting that the jpost as a whole is unreliable . 
  it 's not a jpost news article though , it 's an opinion piece by someone from a conservative think-tank . 
  `` sympathetic toward , '' `` want to fight '' and `` western interests '' are all very broad . 
  you can be `` sympathetic toward '' someone because you think they 're deluded .
