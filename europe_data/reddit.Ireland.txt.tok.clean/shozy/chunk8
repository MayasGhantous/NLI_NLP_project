  you can `` want to fight '' without using violence . 
  `` western interests '' can mean the interests of huge western tobacco or oil companies . 
  i 'm not saying there 's nothing to be worried about , just that that question is n't specific enough to assess it . 
  was going to disagree because when someone says `` the government '' they almost always mean the second definition . 
  but looking back the original poster did n't say `` the government , '' they said `` being able to criticise government is just as important ... '' so yeah you 've got a fair point . 
  the price british producers of potatoes and vegetable oil can get by exporting their produce just went up so they 're going to ask for a higher price domestically to match that . 
  same way all throughout the chain including walkers themselves , even if every single input was sourced from the uk . 
  if any of those are in demand elsewhere in the world , lower sterling , all else being equal , will lead to higher prices . 
  things like transport costs are what stops it being a 1:1 ratio of price increase to sterling drop . 
  it 's not whataboutism it 's about pointing out that big companies having an unfair advantage due to tax laws is an international problem that needs to be solved internationally and pointing at one aspect of it that france has a particular problem with . 
  instead you 'd prefer to continue referring to other countries as parasites and tax havens and ignore any of your own government 's responsiblity for the problem . 
  ireland is not a tax haven because it 's all , legal , publicly recorded and any other country is in theory free to come along and say that the profit was made in their country despite what the conglomerate has said and they 're taxing it now . 
  i miss 3 + years ago when you 'd look at a comment like that and say `` this is such obvious trolling why is anyone taking it seriously '' . 
  now it seems insane outrageous posts are more likely to be truly held beliefs than trolling . 
  1 % corporation tax as a percentage of revenue is just as possible for a small company . 
  any company not making a profit is paying 0 % corporation tax . 
  thats true in any country that i 'm aware of . 
  non multinational companies ca n't take advantage of the interplay between different tax laws in different countries to lower what their profits are counted as . 
  the largest companies in france are subject to only an 8 % corporation tax rate on profits . 
  https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-10-23/to-promote-fairness-simplify-corporate-taxation so by your logic is france a tax-haven for its own large companies ? 
  ireland does n't have many tax loopholes for what should be paid on profits . 
  where the issue arises is what the profits are and where they should be counted . 
  something that governments need to work together on deciding the answer to . 
  it 's not something for one `` parasite '' country to decide on its own . 
  u mad ? 
  the pre-rebate calculation would be the same in pounds , since it 's based on percentages of things that ( in the uk 's case ) are in pounds . 
   while there are of course some racists in the uk and these would have tended to vote leave , it is worth noting that this number of people is likely tiny . 
  that 's unfortunately not true . 
  3 % of people self reported as very prejudiced and 27 % of people as a little prejudiced in 2013 . https://www.natcen.ac.uk/media/338779/selfreported-racial-prejudice-datafinal.pdf even if you only took the 3 % i would n't describe that as a tiny number of people . 
   [ 350m ] is a gross figure rather than a net figure hang on you 're not seriously still defending the figure !? 
  you must know by now that no , it is not the gross figure !, 
  it 's the what the gross figure would be if the `` rebate '' did n't exist , which makes suggestions that you could spend it on any alternative a lie . 
  also since the rebate is actually inaccurately named that money is n't actually ever sent to the eu it 's entirely false and almost certainly a lie on that count as well since i 'd expect them to have known that . 
  they used the same colour for < 13 as for data unavailable !, 
  terrible mistake to make !, 
  if you click through to the source there 's no data for ireland . 
  the only < 13 countries with data are italy and romania . 
   you ignorant bastard cool . 
  another way of putting it is that logic for the car industry is the same as for the government . 
  yes it would hurt not to make a good deal with britain but it would hurt even more if making too good of a deal lead to a break up of the eu . 
   preventing the genocide if kurds by saddam so on the one hand a war in 2003 was to prevent genocidal acts committed in 1988 . 
   and yadhizi by isis and on the other hand half-assed intervention starting in 2011 supporting rebels against the syrian government was to stop genocidal acts committed by a different group also fighting the syrian government in 2014 . 
  are you sure you 're actually interested in history ? 
   so in summary you think the uk is n't superior because we fought against gebocide ? 
  no it is n't superior because it is ** right now ** hiding human rights violations by its allies using weapons it sold them . 
  i notice how you ignored that . 
  you 've global influence that is used to make the world worse and your economic influence to make the world less equal . 
  anyway i 'm bored of this conversation . 
  so , to be honest , this whole superior schtick is a load of nationalist bollox that i was just playing along with because i was bored before . 
  i 'm assuming you 're young and that 's why you got the iraq history stuff so mixed up so you 'll probably grow out of your nationalism some day . 
  i do n't think anyone old enough to properly remember it would make that mistake . 
  in the mean time , ask yourself do you think the us and china are superior to the uk in every single way because using your metrics they would be . 
  or does the whole idea of comparing them in that way not seem a bit silly ? 
  well you used the word ** superior ** , not bigger , so ... uk global military power has recently made the world dramatically less safe , iraq , syria , etc. 
  ireland at worst has made no difference , at best its participation in un peacekeeping missions makes the world marginally safer . 
  that 's vastly superior in my books . 
  uk global political power , well that drove the military mistakes . 
  also they 're blocking human rights investigations for the sake of selling arms to one of the worst regimes on the planet . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/24/yemen-britain-human-rights-inquiry irish political power probably has no overall effect on the world , which is vastly superior to again , making the world worse . 
  uk global economic power , did you mean london economic power ? 
  because apparently you 've got 9 of the top 10 worst areas for poverty in northern europe , clearly those areas must n't have `` superior '' economic power . 
  london has economic power and internationally they use that to the benefit of money markets , bankers and the financial sector . 
  ireland on the other hand ... actually does the exact same thing , but less . 
  so only barely superior here . 
   do you dispute this ? 
  yes . 
  it 's a serious matter you should n't be laugjing about it . 
   just pointing it the fact , also the irony of an irishman laugjing about the british going back to the past , surely that should worry you no ? 
  is this some old fashioned trolling ? 
  or are you actually so rabidly supremacist that you forgot how to type ? 
  aww , there it is !, 
  and you said you did n't care :'), 
  just guessing there 's probably many more farmers in ireland than cyprus and that makes up such a big part of the eu budget . 
  do n't have time for a fully researched reply and do n't have the figures for just food ( though i was n't limiting it to that ) but there 's a 20 percentage point rise in cpi since 2006 in the u.k. http://www.rateinflation.com/consumer-price-index/uk-historical-cpi if you have evidence that food prices for consumers are ** significantly ** lower that 'd be great . 
  i suspect they may be lower because of the global food prices leading to the real price being lower . 
  also the drop measured in euro from the end of 2006 to the start of 2016 is actually less than the drop since june to now . 
  unemployment is a bad thing because it measures people who are n't working but are actively seeking work . 
  people complain about it as a measurement but it 's good because it 's unequivocally bad if unemployment is high . 
  there are reasons why employment would decrease that are n't bad . 
  price rises for an open economy are absolutely inevitable if its currency is devalued especially to such a degree . 
  unilever and tesco are already in a price row with unilever wanting a 10 % price increase for its products . 
  even if the uk leaves the custom union they wo n't unilaterally remove all its tariffs at once because it needs them as bargaining chips to get other countries to lower their tariffs on uk goods . 
  it 'll be years maybe more than a decade until there 's tariff free food and that 's only if uk farmers do n't organise to limit it in the mean time . 
  this is why there 's a time limit in article 50 negotiations . 
  depends what 's meant by pro-eu . 
  i 'd say we 're the most happy with the eu status quo ( as an institution , not all it 's policies ) . 
  when it comes to the `` eu ideal '' in abstract that 's not much of a thing here apart from the type of people who go and work for the eu . 
  which is why the eu tries to phase those things out ... and then somehow people get nationalistic about power outlets . 
  i say we expel everyone , including citizens !, 
   i do n't , certainly not for empire . 
  i think that is a view being propagated largely by people disappointed by the vote . 
  a quote from boris :  the continent [ africa ] may be a blot , but it is not a blot upon our conscience . 
  the problem is not that we were once in charge , but that we are not in charge any more [ original article from 2002 ] ( http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/07/boris-archive-africa-mess-cant-blame-colonialism/ ) i have n't seen any imperialist policies yet , just attitudes . 
   however you will note that she publicly dropped it before becoming pm she dropped it and then started raising it again last month . 
  though i now see from the weekend she wants to exempt the uk military from it , so she may limit the changes to that , dunno if that would be in violation of the gfa entirely , but it would certainly be in violation of the spirit given that some of the human rights violations in ni were committed by the army . 
   the situation with greece is as much a reflection of german public opinion and the need to prop up both the euro and the eu . 
  now as you mention , it is kicking the can down the road because it does n't solve the core issue , but then that is costly and politically problematic too . 
  german public opinion and the german government 's reelection is not the same as what is in german interests . 
  germany 's interests and propping up the euro would have been better served by increased wages in germany and public investment . 
  ideally massively increased investment in the least developed parts of europe 's infrastructure but if ( understandably ) that was unpalatable , massive investment in germany 's infrastructure alone would have been better than what they did .
