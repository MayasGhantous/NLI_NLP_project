  i do not accept that if politicians were n't actively convincing people wage increases were bad that the german public would be against them . 
   the reality though is that the negotiators will be working on a reasonably solid set of directions on both sides , and will be working without the need for political grandstanding ( the politicians will do that in tandem ... ) . 
  so i 'm not that worried about it . 
  two years is a very short amount of time for this though and it could very well be the grandstanding that keeps it to two years . 
   the world is realigning itself that 's what i meant and i think it 's terrible . 
  overall i think you missed by point here though . 
  my whole point is that the worst case scenarios are much better than what have happened in the past . 
  ( ok maybe not the worst case scenario , nukes are still a thing after all but you know what i mean . 
  the worst , likely scenarios . ), 
  i chose ww1 because like after ww1 the world is realigning into a more isolationist position and nationalism is rising . 
  more and more people are becoming anti-internationalist and anti-trade ( i am not defending all the things that have been and have been reported to be included in trade deals recently , those have exacerbated the movement away from trade . ), 
  at the moment it 's looking like trump will lose but even if he does the rhetoric and its support base will continue unless things improve faster than they are now . 
  i 'd also include the 2008 crash as all part of the same ( potential ) turning point . 
  having said that things could turn around quite rapidly . 
  on paper , economically a lot of countries are reaching the stage were ordinary people normally start to notice the improvement , uk included in that . 
  on paper , we 're getting better climate change agreements . 
  to a certain degree you 're right but 6 months ago neither the uk , irish or eu governments wanted the uk to leave the eu . 
  so right now i do not have faith in analyses that depend entirely on everyone acting on what is rationally in their economic interest . 
  ( or even their political interest . ), 
  edit : to address your post a bit more , accepting whatever level of illegal activity that an unenforced/under-enforced border entails would count as a compromise by the uk government to me . 
  -- rant ahead , for tl ; dr , just read first paragraph above . 
  and to be honest , i think the current uk government are incompetent and nostalgic for the times of the british empire . 
  i have a certain amount of faith in the british civil service to take over negotiations and stop the politicians from ruining things too badly but there 's only so much they can do . 
  theresa may for instance , who is one of the more competent members of her government . 
  ( faint praise ) consistently has said that she will take the uk out of the echr , despite it being a condition of the good friday agreement that the echr apply to all laws in northern ireland . 
  might she come up with some arrangement where the echr applies in ni but not the rest of the uk , maybe , but as far as i can see she has n't even mentioned it as a challenge . 
  and if she does n't do that ( or abandon entirely the plan to repeal the echr from uk law ) why should anyone trust any deal the uk makes ? 
  in an even worse level of stupidity members of her government keep bringing up the idea of current eu citizens resident in the uk being bargaining chips . 
  all rational analyses shows that it would be devastating to try to kick that many workers out of the country at once , even if they could somehow manage it logistically . 
  it 's an even stupider idea emotionally as there are 28 vetos ( other 27 members and the eu parliament ) in play and it only takes pissing one of them off enough ( some of whom do n't have much to lose ) for there to be no deal . 
  do n't get me wrong the rest of the governments eu are `` tough negotiators . '', 
  ... in the worst possible way . 
  it was entirely against the interests of the project ( and indeed all the nations individually ) to focus on `` punishing '' the peripheral states and constantly bringing things to the brink before kicking the can down the road . 
  ( even to this day the problems are n't solved ) their governments decided to make an economic problem a question of ( inaccurate ) morals . 
  if anyone thinks the news stories of them wanting to `` punish '' the uk 's decision are inaccurate or exaggerated then they need to read more from greece . 
  and sorry again to bring this back to the uk government 's incompetence but they 're still swanning around as if the eu are going to be push overs and that they 're going to dictate terms to them . 
  point being , i see no reason to be optimistic right now , except in the sense that this is our world war 1 moment and it 's a hell of a lot better than other generations ' ww1 moments ... like ww1 for instance . 
  i know about the miami show band massacre . 
  my only doubt was if it actually did stop any smuggling or illegal activity . 
  there 's no doubt that on an every day basis inconvenienced law abiders . 
  and in that case was used by terrorists/people in the british intelligence services to murder innocent people . 
  my understanding is that they were n't very effective at stopping smuggling or the movement of criminals even at the time . 
  they primarily only inconvenienced law abiders . 
  the uk gov wants to control the number of immigrants entering the uk and they recently reaffirmed that want to set their own regulations on goods bought and sold within the uk . 
  they also do n't want a hard border . 
  those two sets of wants are fairly incompatible without the uk agreeing to a compromise . 
  it 's nonsense to say that it `` sits '' with one side . 
  it sits with all sides in the negotiations that start next march . 
  here , the fellows a know nothing joke , do n't waste your time . 
  oh hey a continued ignoring of any of the points i made , sweet !, 
  how about closing the double irish , ( the one apple was using ) , oh we started phasing that out in 2014 ? 
  http://www.independent.ie/business/budget/ireland-abolishes-controversial-double-irish-tax-rule-30663386.html but you did n't know that , because you do n't know any facts , you 're of the donald trump school of argumentation . 
  you ** feel ** like ireland 's corporation tax framework is damaging its finances so even if all the facts say it 's not and was never anything to do with ireland 's financial problems then that does n't matter . 
  they did n't get kicked out the first time they did or said something racist though , they got kicked out when ** the media ** caught them doing or saying something racist . 
  i 'm contending , with admittedly no evidence only conjecture , that as leader of the party farrage knew the views of his party colleagues better than the media did . 
  nice , bring up a tangent instead of addressing any of my points . 
   they have been shredding their own economy ( greek style ) by not collecting taxes for decades tho . 
  defend this claim . 
  since 2011 corporation tax receipts have been going up . 
  ( and since 1989 only in 2007-2009 and 2011 did it decrease compared to the year before ) who is or is n't paying into that is irrelevant . 
  slight adjustment needed :  you mean apart from all those times they kicked an mp out for ** getting caught ** being racist . 
  that 's the `` for as long as it benefits him . '', 
  ahahahaha , very good . 
  usually it 's hyperbole to say that a policy would drive away all multinationals from the eu but yours literally would since the nash equilibrium of it would be a 100 % rate across the eu . 
  all below average countries would rise it to the average , which would increase the average . 
  that continues until everyone is at the rate of the highest country . 
  then if any country increases it above that then they 'd be the only country that multinationals are allowed in so everyone would try to do that . 
  that remains true until the rate reaches 100 % . 
   ireland is one of the big countries . 
  they have been shredding their own economy ( greek style ) by not collecting taxes for decades tho . 
  you really should n't talk about stuff when you do n't have the slightest clue . 
  maybe look at what the government debt was 10 years ago . 
  or the size of the deficit ( hint , it was n't a deficit it was a surplus ) . 
  here 's a start : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ireland/government-debt in 2006 that 's about $ 10,200 per person , for reference germany at the time was about $ 18,600 per person . 
  it peaked around $ 47,000 per person in 2013 . 
  i 'm avoiding using % gdp because it flatters ireland unfairly . 
  then look at what happened to corporation tax revenues when we lowered the rate . 
  it was 20 % in 2001 , 16 % in 2002 and 12.5 % from 2003 onwards https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporation_tax_in_the_republic_of_ireland#2001_to_present_.28euro_bn.29 irish water was n't ( / is n't ) private , [ source ] ( https://www.water.ie/about-us/company/about-irish-water/ ) . 
  more privatisation happened during the boom than the bust . 
  yup , that 's sort of the staple of his political career when you think about it . 
  probably not a racist himself but happy to stay quiet about voters for his party and colleagues in his party who are , for as long as it benefits him . 
  having said what i 've said , irish governments in conjunction with other countries ' governments have definitely slowed it down from happening because it does make having a unified rate a few relatively easy steps away ( in technical terms not political ) , but when it comes to the final proposal this time i 'm predicting they wo n't veto it . 
  also keeping the debate going on this has postponed the date when people start talking about the next potential step , which would probably be a minimum rate which would n't be too bad for ireland if it 's below our rate but keeping the debate on that going for as long as possible will stop the next debate from happening and so on . 
  they 'd need to take that into account if they can yes . 
  coming up with a fair ccctb is not an easy task and there will definitely be situations that people can point to and say it does n't make sense but if they do it well it should be considerably better than the status quo . 
  farage did but he did n't run the bus ad about it . 
  it 's a common set of rules for where the profits of corporate groups are considered to be from . 
  a country could set its rate to 0 but that would only apply to the profits that are considered to have been made in that country . 
  profits considered to have been made in another country would be taxed by that other country at the rate that other country decides . 
   in terms of the european commission 's proposal to introduce a common consolidated corporate tax base ( ccctb ) , minister noonan [ ireland 's finance minister ] said ireland was willing to discuss the proposal but had `` two red lines '' -- `` one that the fixing of rates will still be a matter for sovereign governments as it is under the treaties now and secondly that any change will require unanimity as it is now with tax matters , '' he said . 
  http://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/noonan-oecd-report-poses-no-threat-to-foreign-direct-investment-1.2379517 those red lines are current eu policies . 
  i 'd be astonished if the final version of ccctb does n't keep them . 
  anytime ccctb is mentioned people think it 's a minimum tax rate . 
  it 's not , it 's a common set of rules for how the location of profits should be determined in the eu . 
  if it stayed as only ccctb member states could tax those profits at whatever rate they want . 
  then ni needs to still be part of the single market , which i 'd definitely favour ( obviously since i want the whole uk to stay in the eu in the first place ) . 
  unionists would hate it too and it would fly in the face of thersa may emphasising that the tories are officially the `` conservative and unionist party . '', 
  it 's not about driving a wedge it 's about being a customs union . 
  you ca n't be a customs union if you do n't enforce it and you ca n't leave a customs union without instituting checks either . 
  saying you can leave a customs union and not have customs checkpoints is nonsensical .
