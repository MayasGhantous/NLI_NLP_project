  it 's a recession , surely the government can at least have the decency to let us drink ourselves to death on the cheap . 
  not much has changed in 143 years . 
  yurp . 
  the europeans and americans alike itt need to stop bickering like a bunch of children . 
  whether you like it or not europe and the us are intrinsically linked through family , war , trade , language , culture and through history . 
  the europeans are the ones who settled continental america and became what we know today as americans . 
  so this is not a case of them and us . 
  americans and europeans need to work together to kill this crap that the nsa is trying to pull . 
  we need to badger our politicians from the bottom to the top . 
  americans get onto your congressmen and senators , europeans get onto your mps and meps . 
  just like with acta/sopa we can get this killed with enough persuasion . 
  edit : wording . 
  no way do we want a us company to own a european telecoms giant . 
  especially one as shit as at&t . 
  you have to be shitting me ... 
  good call !,

  otherwise i hope you enjoyed your stay . 
  back to the 1930 's you go !, 
  the two are probably related !, 
  i would imagine that sharing a land border with russia necessitated the creation of a larger armed force/better prepared populace . 
  it 's probably a relic left over from the cold war . 
  did i stutter ? 
  the eu proves again that it is a force for good in the world and that our moral compass as a whole wo n't be swayed . 
  this is why europe needs to go to an all nuclear/renewable mix of power . 
  i know exactly what an embargo is , and i said nothing to the contrary of what you just said . 
  using a us based service ( . com domain ) to advertise/sell a product ( cuban cigars ) that is banned by a longstanding ** embargo ** is not the same thing . 
  where the data is hosted is ultimately where the law applies . 
  in the cigars case the us was well within it 's right to pull the domain for violating an embargo , just like the company selling cigars was well within it 's rights to use a domain from another country and continue trading . 
  the data is hosted on servers in the websites respective country , so it is subject to that country 's law and nobody else 's . 
  you 're going to have a hard time getting a european judge to enforce us law . 
  the most verisign could do would be cancel the domain for that company , in which case it takes about 5 minutes to buy another one elsewhere and point it at your servers . 
  a poor analogy would be that domain names are like a phonebook , they just point you in the direction where the data is actually hosted . 
  that 's not how the internet works . 
  a domain suffix is not indicative of where the service is hosted . 
  these are the ones i found anyways .

  i did n't mean in terms of racism , i was writing in terms of looking after it 's citizens . 
  i do expect that a lot of things posted on / r/politics are sensational but those are politics that we see on a website that is very us-centric . 
  the us is n't a bad rolemodel but there are areas where it does fall down and those are areas we should n't emulate and should strive to do better in . 
  just for the record , the olive oil directive was scrapped because of the large backlash from the people of europe . 
  i actually know a few guys over in chicago right now looking for a few jobs , can you could recommend any places that you think might be hiring for the summer ? 
  i 'm glad to hear that you guys can tolerate us over there !, 
  all we hear from the us is horror stories about people being crushed by student and health debt . 
  that it 's a country where the corporations are people , and the likes monsanto can destroy your environment with impunity.where you have the highest rate of incarceration in the world and education cost more than it 's reasonably worth . 
  where lobbyists can ram seemingly anything they want down your senates throats given enough money but children ca n't get a school lunch if they are 40c short . 
  is it so wrong that we would n't want to end up like the united states ? 
  do n't get my wrong , the american people are fantastic and i 'd never for a second put them down . 
  but the us government seems to selectively chose which parts of the constitution it upholds , and in the process it lets down a lot of those fantastic people . 
  he 's right though , we do n't want the eu to end up like a copy of the usa . 
  we can and we should do it better !, 
  [ mfw ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bwnka8mxdai/t0fua-nbuei/aaaaaaaaake/mhhsof9gpoo/s1600/honey+badger.jpg ), 
  you certainly do take yourself seriously . 
   you know that `` fastest growing '' is marketing for `` smallest '' , right ? 
  anyway , it 's nowhere fucking near where we should be . 
  we have the fucking atlantic wall !!, 
  i take it you do n't do numbers then ? 
  fastest growth overall is still fastest growth no matter what the initial size was . 
   and given our location we should be the home of both . 
  the technology does n't just come to maturity just because you think it should . 
  what do you think the marine institute and martin ryan institute are working on down in galway ? 
  there are other countries with more money to throw at the research than ireland . 
   kentucky fried royal bullshit my good man . 
  i worked 5 nights a week , 5 hours a day in manufacturing in the evenings after college and got my degree . 
  it 's possible , just less readily available nowadays . 
  thats all fine and well to find the time to work 5 nights a week when you 're doing your nice easy arts or commerce degree . 
  but people doing the likes of science , engineering and medicine can have courseloads of more than 40 hours a week . 
   what 's your basis for this ? 
  far as i can see , having gone to college ten fucking years ago , there were plenty of stem graduates for a long , long time . 
  law and accountancy have always been low class size courses . 
  10 years ago , says it all really . 
  go look at any big irish uni and see how many are in each faculty if you do n't believe me ? 
  look at nuig for example , they take in some 1000 arts students and over 100 law students but only take under 400 science students and under 150 engineers . 
   sir , i call bullshit on your replies . 
  good day . 
  you went to college 10 years ago supposedly , maybe you should have grown up by now . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  15 % of ireland 's power comes from wind , we also have one of the highest growth rate in wind power in the world . 
  where is this oil of which you speak ? 
  because i 've certainly never heard of any proven oil reserves in ireland . 
  wave and tidal power are still experimental technologies . 
  what fisheries were sold ? 
  ireland gave up its exclusive fishing rights to the sea around ireland when it joined the eu , which was of much greater economic benefit than a few tonnes of cod . 
  i 'm not going to go ahead and defend ireland as a mecca of organisation and intelligent thinking as we 're far from that but the country is n't as bad as you make out . 
  the youth unemployment rate is heavily influenced by the property bust . 
  many young men would dropped out of school to take up trades involved in construction , these are young men who are now unemployed and fall under the category of youth unemployment due to their age . 
  another factor in our huge youth unemployment is the sheer number of young people who are at 3rd level education , they ca n't work because they are studying full time . 
  2013/2014 will be the real test of ireland 's economy because are getting the first wave of graduates who predominately chose to pick up stem subjects in response to the recession as opposed to the droves of lawyers and accountants we used to get . 
  great , i 'm due to graduate with a degree in one of those subjects ... 
  yeah i learned that getting summer work while at uni , it 's definitely harder to get a job in hospitality if you 're a male . 
  is there anything the scots wo n't fry ? 
  do n't forget the [ waterford blaa ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xcp18azyteg/tmsxhellxti/aaaaaaaaahu/sfyxmh0vcd8/s1600/blaa.jpg ), 
  the stuff you buy in the shop is usually dry as ass and tastes awful . 
  the homemade stuff is glorious though . 
  i 'm not implying anyone should stop sending aid . 
  i 'm saying that we need to get our house in order before we think about doing anything for anyone else . 
  a healthy european economy is much more useful to the rest of the world than a sick one . 
  europe needs to worry about itself first and the rest of the world second .
