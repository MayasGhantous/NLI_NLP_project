  the fault does n't lie with the workers or their professions but with the systematic failure of the government to properly audit and reform . 
  that 's because the average working class person without and formal qualifications other than a safe pass could go and slap down bricks and mortar for good money . 
  now all the money is in it and pharma so the people who see the benefits are the ones who bothered with education . 
  hold on now , do n't even think for one second the eu is n't holding all of the cards in this negotiation . 
  the eu has what the uk needs , not the other way around . 
  the eu does n't have to be mature in this debate , what it actually needs is to be so petulant as to banish any thoughts of any other country leaving . 
  it needs to completely stomp out the notion that there can be an ' a la carte ' access to the single market . 
  the gnp grew a huge amount too so it 's not all inflated figures . 
  you can be damn sure than cta is going to fly out of the window when the uk officially leaves . 
  the eu wo n't allow it . 
  problem with galway is that it 's known as ` the graveyard of ambition ' . 
  this is not an insult either . 
  people go to galway with the intentions of only staying a little while . 
  but then they fall in love with the place ( and the people ) , and become comfortable . 
  their ambitions die because they never then want to leave !, 
  galway is honestly my favourite place in the world . 
  you 're right on that one !, 
  maybe you should read the article . 
  the issue is n't if they can afford to cover those expense , it 's if they are willing to spend the money in those places . 
   absolutely untrue . 
  eea regulations constitute about 25 % of total eu regulations . 
  please do n't make things up . 
  i 'm not making anything up . 
  if you read down through the article written by the man who was foreign minister of norway , he says when talking about the eea , `` we have incorporated approximately three-quarters of all eu legislative acts into norwegian legislation -- and counting . '' . 
  britain will not get a better deal than that , so 75 % stands as the probable minimum they will have to adopt . 
  with regards to the structural funds , yes britain paid into the pot for thos to happen . 
  but the issue is not the money , the issue is that britain ( and not only britain are guilty of this ) would probably not have invested in these poorer areas like the eu did , the money would just go to large cities or the capital because they are more economically important . 
  less , but not significantly less . 
  on the flip side , you could argue that they might end up paying more in because the pound might get weaker relative to the euro . 
  that depends if the amount paid into the eu pot needs to be done in euros , but that is information i do n't have . 
  that too shall be britain 's fate . 
  so to summarise britain has shot itself in the foot : - it has given up a 16 % voting share and veto powers to one of the worlds largest trading blocs . 
  - it is still going to have to accept 70-90 % of eu rulings in order to be in the eea . 
  - it is still going to have to accept free movement of people in order to be in the efta . 
  - the uk will still have to pay into the eu pot , but will get none of the say in how it 's run . 
  - the farmers and fishermen all over the uk are going to have to survive without cap . 
  - no more eu research grants for british universities . 
  - no more eu structural funds for places like wales and cornwall ( and other poor places the national govt failed to invest ) . 
  the list goes on and on . . - even small things like roaming charges will on mobile phones will be affected . 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
  hundreds of thousands of irishmen signed up to the british army over the course of wwi and wwii and most ended up dead . 
  so the irish did fight . 
  on a side note : a lot of famous officers in the british army were irish too . 
  do n't hate the player , hate the game . 
  we 're 6th in the world at league , 7th at union . 
  if this had been done before the 6n then we 'd be better at union . 
  kind of a poor representation of the way it actually is though !, 
  sweet baby jesus . 
  i was on a more expensive contract for the same stuff ( data , calls etc ) previously but they changed the terms to write these limits in so i ended up using the get out clause and shifting to a contract with the same stuff for half as much and 30 day rolling . 
  so if this does n't fly with the commission , i 'll be a very happy man !, 
  $ 29.99 / month it 's not too bad considering my 4g is very fast too . 
  it 's nice and all but carriers are already trying to shift the goalposts . 
  i have an unlimited calls , texts and data package with my provider in ireland . 
  under this new legislation i could download 100 's of gbs of data while travelling for free , but my carrier has changed my terms to say that i only can use 2gb of my allowance outside of ireland . 
  two birds with one flood . 
  ireland is actually represented 3 times on the flag . 
  the gold harp on a whole blue shield . 
  a gold harp on a blue shield as part of the british coat of arms which has 4 crests on the shield in 4 quadrants representing the home nations of england , wales , scotland and ( northern ) ireland . 
  the blue flag with a three yellow crowns is the coat of arms of sweden , but is also the coat of arms of the province of munster in ireland . 
  i see croatia is 2 years behind the rest of us for fuckboy trends , and that 's a good thing . 
  wait until you see what comes next !, 
  death by a ( hundred ) thousand cuts . 
  i think you may be a little wide of the mark . 
  these companies hate handing over their data to the government . 
  [ apple fought the fbi ] ( http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/ ) over handing over data for a terrorism case ( which is huge in the context of antiterrorism laws ) , and [ microsoft recently fought ] ( https://blogs.microsoft.com/eupolicy/2016/09/05/our-search-warrant-case-microsofts-commitment-to-protecting-your-privacy/ ) in the courts against warrants in order to protect the data assets of its european customers stored in the eu to prevent the us from accessing them , they chose to fight it because the irish government was n't willing to stand up to the us government . 
  governments do n't give too much of a shit about data privacy , but these companies do . 
  data is ** huge ** business , and companies know that if they start handing over customer data willy nilly , they 're going to lose business to their competitors that do n't . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the austerity was pretty harsh . 
  the government reduced its expenditure by more than 30 % from the high point in 2008 , depleted our pension reserve fund and increased our national debt from 35 % to a high of nearly 108 % to get through the last 8 years . 
  it was always been green , white and gold where i went to primary school . 
  i was told it was poetic and lyrical interpretation of the colour , because nothing really rhymes with orange . 
  i was on mobile , did n't see your flair haha !, 
  i suppose it 's hard to nail down what exactly irish culture is , because it shares many traits with gb and other former colonies in the anglosphere like nz and oz . 
  i had a huge paragraph written about what makes irish people , irish . 
  inevitably i figured someone would probably just poke holes in it , so my best advice would be to come see for yourself !, 
  what i chocked it down to is being welcoming , but also being genuinely inclusive . 
  i do n't mean inclusive because someone tells you to be , but the desire to naturally want to include people . 
  take from that what you will , i 'm sure others will give their two cents . 
  anecdotally any of the mohammed 's i know do too . 
  in fact the one i know best loves irish history and is enamoured with michael collins . 
  irish culture is as strong as ever , although becoming more strongly liberal every decade . 
  there is a ** huge ** amount of pride in ireland , and a lot of foreigners buy into our culture and call it their own . 
  there are many pavel 's and mohammed 's in ireland , but they wave the green , white and gold at the end of the day . 
  while i agree that scientific material should be freely available to those who pay for it . 
  i 'd like to play devils advocate and say ; are we not opening that to exploitation ? 
  research done in a given country gives it a competitive advantage . 
  that advantage is fuelled by money , strength in research , domain knowledge and human capital . 
  if we do this , then suddenly the likes of china or russia can negate this competitive advantage for their own gain . 
  it might work if all countries across the world decided to do this at once , but then again not all countries produce quality research !, 
  ah it could n't be the worst thing . 
  bi-lingual polish children who grow up in ireland probably learned to speak polish from their parents , but maybe things like their spelling , grammar and general literacy might not be up to scratch if their parents did n't have the time to teach that stuff to them so it makes sense for poles wanting learn that aspect of their mother tongue to do so . 
  the poles are generally brilliant as an immigrant population , very hardworking , kind and friendly , and they make no bones about fitting in so i see absolutely no problem with it . 
  i 'm sure there are enough qualified poles to do languages classes in the major population centres , a few times a week . 
  meh , ireland had as much % debt per capita in the late 1980 's as it does now but that plummeted to around 22 % in 2008 . 
  we 'll sort out it over the next decade or two . 
  you can see the data [ here ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ireland/government-debt-to-gdp ) . 
  ireland here . 
  i pay $ 55/mo and get unlimited calls , texts and 4g . 
  coverage is n't the best in rural parts , but anywhere urban and i 'm getting about 60 down/20 up .
