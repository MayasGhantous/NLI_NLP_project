  it would mean that the roi would be two separate travel areas : the eu ( for eea freedom of movement , not schengen ) and the cta ( common travel area ) . 
  let 's say an eu citizen travels to the roi : there is nothing preventing them from crossing the border into ni and thus the uk . 
  if you want to prevent non-uk/roi citizens from entering the uk , you have to put border controls back in , either around the cta ( which breaks fom ) or between the uk and the roi ( which breaks the the cta ) . 
  there is * zero * chance of border controls between ni and the roi . 
  that 's what would make travel complicated . 
  the cta already exists , but implementing the details of how it functions are complicated by the uk being outside the eu and the roi being inside it . 
  i think the only people outside of the uk who * really * want the uk to stay in the eu are us here in ireland , mainly because of how much of a pain it would be . 
  that said , there are massive upsides to being , with malta , the only english-speaking countries in the eu ... :-), 
  cameron 's definition of remaining in the eu and that of most people outside the uk is somewhat different . 
  cameron wants a situation where the uk reaps ( almost ) all of the benefits of membership with few the downsides . 
  sure , he 's playing to the tory 's euroskeptic wing with posturing , but he 's hardly what you 'd describe a europhile either . 
  he 's simply aware of the massive downsides of leaving the eu . 
  any random excuse that pops into his head could lead to britain leaving eu , david cameron says . 
  that would really only work with a whole bunch of regional assemblies . 
  or maybe it 's because everything that a normal country would have one of , belgium has two or more of , which do n't talk to one another . 
  belgium 's a nice country , but everything 's slightly broken . 
  it 's be less broken if people would just * talk * to one another . 
  'd \u00e1il \u00c9ireann ' translates as ` assembly of ireland ' , not ` house of representatives ' , which is simply a * description * of the chamber . 
   we actually do n't even know what the true cost is as the british treasury refuses to release those figures and of the figures we have even those are n't accurate . 
  we do have a clear idea of how much of the population of ni is employed by the government . 
  per capita , their level of government employment , 31 % , dwarfs ours , which is 17.4 % [ [ ref ] ( http://www.nerinstitute.net/blog/2015/09/02/recent-changes-in-public-sector-employment-in-oecd/ ) ] . 
  you ca n't just make all those people unemployed , they have to be paid for , and they wo n't be going away for a * long * time . 
  we ca n't even get rid of the duplication of services that the hse was meant to solve , so what makes you think we 're going to reduce that down post reunification ? 
  do you thing the disentangling of bureaucracies and the duplication of resources is going to disappear overnight ? 
  even if further down the road it 's beneficial , and i do n't doubt it might be , you 're totally leaving out the initial fiscal shock that reunification would cause . 
  sure , we might not be talking something like german reunification here , but it 's still not going to be a fun time for anybody . 
  did you know that the per capital gdp of ni is actually * less * than that of [ the west and border region ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_stat-14-29_en.htm ) here ? 
  sure , not having those taxes go back to london might help a bit , but it 's not going to make a whit of difference to its economic output while that massive bureaucracy is being maintained . 
  also , there is n't any major duplication of services on the island : those ones in ni are part of the uk government . 
  things like tourism are * already * done on and all ireland basis . 
    the irish economy would suffer   evidence ? 
  the balance of payments between ni and the rest of the uk is negative . 
  inevitably , that would have to be made up by the rest of the country post-unification . 
  so yes , the economy would suffer . 
  even in the best case scenario of the balance of payments being equal , you 'd still have the costs of integration to deal with . 
   gb unionists want to stay in the uk . 
  irish unionists want to unite ireland . 
  nope . 
  an irish unionist is somebody who wants the roi to become part of the uk again . 
  you are indeed correct . 
  * facepalm *, 
  say what you might about english , but at least anglophones have the good sense to know when to use spaces . 
  edit : jeeze !, 
  some people just do n't have a sense of humour ... 
  it 'll be like 1848 never happened ... 
  for now , but we 're hardly immune to populist bull either . 
  english is alternately french written like dutch and dutch written like french . 
  nah , that 's what makes it kinky . 
  accountability !, 
  whatever shall they do !, 
  nope : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mandarin_ ( bureaucrat ), 
  that 's government by ninja . 
  easy mistake . 
  i dunno : a good case can be made that the government of walloonia is broken even when it ` works ' . 
  i have two to counter that : the bureaucracy . 
  never mind that : the civil service is still around , and it 's a much bigger and more important part of the day-to-day running of the state than the executive is . 
  i mean , one could just as easily use this as an argument for government by mandarin . 
  edit : bloody hell !, 
  i ca n't type today at all . 
  because , as everybody knows , the permanent government , i.e. , the civil service , just goes away when the executive is n't around . 
  / s edit : s/know/knows /, 
   nuts it 's a french acronym : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nomenclature_of_territorial_units_for_statistics, 
  thing 's are never that simple . 
  the language came to be associated with failure and backwardness , and combined with , amongst other things , the ass-backwards way the language was - figuratively and sometimes literally - beaten into people post independence , the country 's relationship with the language is dysfunctional at best . 
  things have been improving since the late '90s though . 
  still , boiling it down to ` if you all wanted to , you could ' does n't even remotely cut it . 
  we had it starved out of us , actually . 
  it has to do with [ structural funds ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuts_statistical_regions_of_the_republic_of_ireland ) . 
  the west , midlands , and border nuts-ii region ( ie01 ) is counted separately from the rest because it 's comparatively poorer than the rest ( ie02 ) . 
  nuts-ii regions do n't correspond to provinces . 
  that 's been the uk 's modus operandi when it comes to the eu/ec/eec since the '80s : use the bloc as a convenient scapegoat for their own bollockry . 
  i , for one , welcome our new mexican overlords !, 
  well , in english , the days of the working week are called `` weekdays '' , whereas all the days together are referred to as `` the days of the week '' [ 1 ] , so it could be a similar phenomenon . 
  [ 1 ] this must confuse learners no end . 
  he just has fabulous lashes . 
  ` realm ' is possibly a more apt translation of ` reich ' and ` rijk ' into english . 
  no , i 'm saying that the effect of immigration is much less that people make it out to be , that the great recession was a vastly bigger contributor to the problem than immigration was , and that other countries not in the eu , and other eu countries , were equally effected . 
  i 'm irish . 
  you realise that we have a larger immigrant population percentage-wise than the uk ? 
  if immigration were the problem , you 'd expect us to have bigger issues with it than the uk , but we * do n't * , and we 're not alone in that . 
  this is just using immigration , the eu , and freedom of movement as scapegoats for a much more complex issue . 
  reality does n't lend itself to simplistic explanations , not matter how much people might wish it would . 
  that has little to do with the eu . 
  you 'll see the same thing in practically every developed nation across the world except maybe australia . 
  here 's why : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_recession, 
  how much of that is * really * due to the political mess on the island though ? 
  it 's one of the few brutalist buildings i actually * like * . 
  where 's the bullying ? 
  the uk made its decision . 
  they just do n't want the process dragged out as doing so is damaging to the eu . 
  the uk is a lame duck in the eu now . 
  as soon as a50 is invoked , the uk is effectively out . 
  no backsies . 
  the two years is only a negotiation and disengagement period , not a grace period . 
  the only route back in is reapplication for membership . 
  it sucks for everyone . 
  the leavers just have n't realised that yet . 
  the eu does n't need to force the issue beyond the initial response already made to the decisions . 
  for the next two years at least , the uk is a lame duck in the eu with no negotiating power . 
  if the uk try to drag things out before triggering a50 or attempt any pre-a50 negotiations , the eu can just stare stone-faced at them and tell them to trigger a50 .
