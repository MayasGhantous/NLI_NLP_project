  you 're right , it 's not . 
  instead , milk chocolate is simply categorised separately from ( plain ) chocolate as its own thing . 
   best army of 19th century navy more than army . 
  they 're ok , i guess . 
  :-) seriously though , the uk is maybe a little too diverse to talk about as an entity . 
  i 'd personally feel more comfortable talking about the various constituent countries of the uk than about the uk as a whole as that 'd do the place more justice . 
  this could be a matter of being , as an irishman , too close and too familiar with the uk and thus the differences are magnified for me where they would n't be for somebody outside of britain and ireland , mind . 
  france and england : the original frenemies . 
  that 's just paris giving the rest of france a bad rep. :-), 
  the same can be said of the scots on account of the [ auld alliance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/auld_alliance ) . 
  aside from it formerly being part of yugoslavia and that the band laibach are from there ( and that their name is the german name for ljubljana ) , not much i 'm afraid . 
  you realise you 're repeating a lot of the same things that people were saying and writing here ten years ago ? 
  every country thinks they 're special or different , but they never are . 
  similarly , irish housing growth was driven by gentrification , immigration , internal migration , and real growth . 
  then people began to see houses as investments either for resale or for rental . 
  speculation happened in the latter period of the boom . 
  the same things happen , time after time after time . 
  when i went over to brussels for the first time a few years back , a friend who 'd lived in belgium for a good number of years summed things up for me like this : `` belgium is a great country , but everything is always slightly broken . '', 
  and it turned out he was right !, 
  i quite like belgium though , even with that in mind . 
  i never write that germany 's economic growth was n't primarily export driven , i simply stated that there was a property bubble developing . 
  that in itself is dangerous , and it can end up causing massive issues for the real economy when it bursts , even if it does n't dominate the economic growth . 
  edit : yup , stick your head in the sand by downvoting . 
  i was called a doomsayer twelve years ago in ireland , and sadly was proven right . 
  german house prices are not growing in tandem with wages . 
  a good rule of thumb is that property prices should stay within a factor of 3x to 4x the average industrial wage . 
  go above that , and you 've an indicator for a bubble , especially if that ratio is continually creeping up . 
  that 's compounded by low interest rates in germany 's case . 
  and it 's [ been going on for a few years at this point ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/rising-property-prices-in-germany-spark-fears-of-a-bubble-8273212.html ) and is still ongoing ( '' [ german home boom as europe stagnates set to hurt merkel ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-27/german-housing-boom-as-europe-stagnates-may-hurt-merkel-at-poll.html ) '' ) . 
  sure , the german economy might be primarily export driven currently , but then again so was ireland 's back in the early 2000 's before it ate itself due to people mistakenly considering property a real investment . 
  now , whether this evens out or continues is the real test of whether the growth is safe of a real bubble . 
  edit : yup , stick your head in the sand by downvoting . 
  i was called a doomsayer twelve years ago in ireland , and sadly was proven right . 
  agreed . 
  i also believe that germany and austria are currently committing the same grievous , idiotic error that we here in ireland were guilty of by growing a property bubble . 
  if that blows , the result wo n't be pretty at all .

  consider me sceptical . 
  the reason those countries have no territorial waters is because they have no coastline . 
  it 's the presence of a coastlines that entitles countries to territorial waters .

  addendum : lordi and wife carrying !, 
  how could i forget those !, 
  ` r\u00edomhaire ' is the term , i 'm afraid . 
  :-) funnily enough , you were n't all that far off the scots gaelic term , which is ` coimpiutair ' . 
  your spelling did n't quite fit irish or scots gaelic orthography right though , but it was a good guess . 
  actually , `` caff\u00e8 latte '' was originally borrowed into english in the 19th century , even appearing in the oed . 
  it was later contracted to `` latte '' , so it 's a borrowing that contracted rather than a pseudo-italianism . 
  not quite the same kind of borrowing : teilif\u00eds , raidi\u00f3 , teileaf\u00f3n , & c. preserve the meaning and only alter the words to fit the target language 's phonotactics and orthography . 
  the kind of borrowing the op is talking about are more naive borrowing where a somebody unfamiliar with a language borrows terms from another ( usually prestige ) language as-is , but rather than preserving the meaning and letting semantic shift happen later , they apply their own meaning from the context they originally saw the phrase in . 
  a pseudo-borrowing wo n't originally have made sense in the ` source ' language . 
  english has a few of these , with one of the most famous being `` double entendre '' , which is n't and was never a valid french idiom , but is a pseudo-borrowing from french . 
  not a lot beyond it being europe 's last dictatorship , it being deathly poor , and that the country 's name translated as ` white russia ' . 
  nah , they 're not * that * bad . 
  but nearly everybody likes the polish !, 
  that looks like a perfectly fine road to me . 
  second highest density of them in the world after scotland , who pip us by a wee bit .

  ** ireland ** * it rained . 
  this was a bigger deal than you 'd think , given we 're not used to these long stretches of dry sunny weather .

  any chance you could add the [ four irish provinces ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/provinces_of_ireland ) ? 
  well , i 'm irish and live in ireland , so i use the irish flag . 
  given this is / r/europe , i do n't really see the point of using the eu flag as it 's too vague . 
  in fact , if the connacht flag or sligo coat of arms were available , i 'd use those instead . 
  every sunday i 've been busy with stuff . 
  mondays were a surprise . 
  * it was relatively recently reformed into a federal state . 
  * beer , waffles , delicious chips , and chocolate . 
  * brussels is a much nicer and more interesting city than people would think . 
  * nearly everything 's closed on mondays . 
  * `` filet am\u00e9ricain '' is steak tartare . 
  * nearly everybody in brussels , francophones included , spoke english to me the second their heard my accent , which was very nice , but it would 've been nice to try to practice my french while i was there because i could understand most people pretty well . 
  * comic books !, 
  which is also how i found out nearly everything is closed on mondays . 
  i hunted about for information of what the cash transaction limit might be in ireland , but have n't been able to find anything . 
  sorry , yes , i misremembered that . 
  it 's that the marka is pegged to the euro .
