  [ chunnel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/channel_tunnel ) is a colloquialism in english , and english is fond of its [ portmanteaus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portmanteau ) !, 
  and the british government likely carried it into law in a stricter sense than it was intended , so now all the likes of the daily mail and ukip do is bitch about how horrible the eu is because of it . 
   yes , the funny world of eu trying to get nations to play along and not actually being granted the authority to do so . 
  yup !, 
  the eu really is a bit of a mess in that regard : `` this is a requirement , but not really , but it is , but some have opt outs , but it 's all strictly voluntary , but not really , ... '' :-)  despite erm2 entry being voluntary eurozone membership is still an accession criterion . 
  funny situation eh ? 
  i 'd think a 15 year delay - where it is clear that the delay is politically motivated and not economic - would be sufficient to kick the offending state out of the eu . 
  the thing is , it could potentially be * both * political and economic . 
  even now , the economies of eu member states are quite heterogeneous when taken as a group . 
  in fact , that very diversity was , by way of example , one of the reasons so much money ended up being pumped into the irish economy from primarily german banks and why we ended up with interest rates meant to help germany that were way too low for the irish economy , both of which were major contributors to what ended up happening with our property bubble . 
  [ in case it seems otherwise , i 'm not blaming germany for anything ; it 's just an example . 
  just because somebody hands you a gun , it does n't mean you have to shoot yourself . 
  and every country that has a bubble thinks its the exception . ], 
   i recall reading on several occasions that scotland would be ejected from the eu , need to re-apply as a new nation , and be forced to accept the euro as all new applicants are . 
  and doing that would cause a host of difficulties given the size of the new nation 's economic zone . 
  moreover , there 's the issue of scots living in eu member states . 
  it 'd be interesting to see if somebody actually tried to force something like that . 
  i 've a feeling it 'd be a fiasco . 
  moreover , even with the common travel area , we usually end up having to present passports when travelling between great britain and ireland regardless of the jurisdiction . 
  islands really are different . 
   which has decided not to meet the convergence criteria it 's only made a requirement in accession treaties . 
  technically , [ joining erm-ii is voluntary ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/adoption/erm2/index_en.htm ) :  participation in erm ii is voluntary although , as one of the convergence criteria for entry to the euro area , a country must participate in the mechanism without severe tensions for at least two years before it can qualify to adopt the euro . 
  as well as that , scotland has the advantage that , if it becomes independent , it could argue that those opt-outs that applied to the uk should apply to scotland until scotland decides otherwise . 
   interestingly both montenegro and kosovo have unilaterally adopted the euro , without following the normal accession process , being in the eu , or being allowed to do so by the ecb . 
  well , there 's nothing really stopping them from doing that . 
  it 's just that they ca n't mint their own coins and do n't have a say in monetary policy regarding the currency . 
  it does make sense from their point of view as it makes them more attractive for investment and tourism purposes , and pulls them further out of serbia 's sphere of influence . 
  moreover , slovenia , bosnia , and greece already use the euro . 
   if you join the eu you will have to use the euro and you will join the eu . 
  that 's not a requirement for eu entry . 
  aw , shucks !, 
  ij tink des sjits oell on mij braain . 
  careful now : if a briton and a french person agree on too much , it will cause the chunnel to fill with singularities that will consume the planet . 
  i would 've expected france to be higher , myself . 
  it might be better to refer to this particular bunch as ` loyalists ' rather than ` unionist ' : people identifying as ` loyalists ' are the ones who tend attempt stuff like this , whereas ` unionists ' simply refers to those wishing to remain in the uk rather than either independence or unification with the republic . 
  \\* facepalm \\* yeah , i know that . 
  i 've fixed the typo . 
  what 's worse is i know people with the name ` henning ' in real life . 
  the wikipedia article on [ st\u00f8d ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st%c3%b8d ) might help . 
  st\u00f8d does n't refer to glottal stops though : it 's where the use of [ creaky voice ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/creaky_voice ) is phonemically significant , which * is * a rather unusual feature of the language . 
  it 's not unknown in other languages , but it * is * unusual . 
  * st\u00f8d * butter biscuits * [ this sketch ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ) from norwegian tv * [ poul-henning kamp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poul-henning_kamp ) ( i use freebsd ) * it 's produced some surprisingly good tv for a country its size in recent years * niels bohr * hans christian andersen * beowulf was set there * lego * and , naturally , vikings . 
  edit : fixed typos . 
  greenlandish , to be precise . 
  i 've ran into the same issue where something i 've linked to like that gets misinterpreted . 
  sorry about that . 
  thanks . 
  that 's an idiot protesting the effective repeal of rule 42 though . 
  nobody pays any attention to those gobshites though . 
   not quite the same thing . 
  which photo ? 
  are you referring the one [ here ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/08/queen-britain-croke-park-ireland ) or [ here ] ( http://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/six-nations/2013/0208/366813-ireland-england-2007/ ) ? 
  none of the other photos that came up in that image search are in any way indicative of sectarianism ( other than intercounty rivalries ) or strife . 
  if it 's the first photo i linked to that you 're referring to , you 've misinterpreted it ; if it 's the second , the same goes as it 's of idiots protesting the fact that the gaa were allowing rugby to be played at croke park . 
  yeah ... you 've got that wrong . 
  you 're thinking of ' [ rule 42 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rule_42 ) ' , and it had nothing to do with ` english sports ' :  grounds controlled by association units shall not be used or permitted to be used , for horse racing , greyhound racing , or for field games other than those sanctioned by central council . 
  it had to do with sports other than those organised by the gaa . 
  croke park has been used on and off for sports other than those organised by the gaa for a while now , and it was never enforced all that much in stadia other than croke park . 
  as mattshil wrote , there are * much * better things to make the point you 're trying to make than rule 42 , such as [ rule 21 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rule_21 ) , which was repealed back in 2001 . 
  no , it 's not ` badly translated ' . 
  it 's the closest equivalent term in context . 
  ` hunger ' simply does n't work in english as a straight translation . 
  even today we use ` gorta ' as the translation of ` famine ' into irish . 
  i 'm * very * much aware of what ` gorta ' means . 
  i also know all the other terms for the event , such as ` an drochshaol ' , ` an d\u00fachan ' , & c. is there a genuine point to your language sophistry , or you just playing language games ? 
  if it 's the former , actually * justify * your point ; if it 's the latter , you 're just wasting my time by splitting hairs . 
  addendum : oh , and if you want the * actual * translation of ` gorta ' , dinneen is basically the standard , and you can [ read its definition here ] ( http://glg.csisdmz.ul.ie/index.php?find=irish&amp;wordsearched=283613&amp;searchtype=1 ) . 
  also , there 's macbain 's dictionary of scots gaelic , and -- surprise , surprise -- [ it agrees ] ( http://www.ceantar.org/dicts/mb2/mb21.html ) . 
  irish also has some great idioms : ` ag bualadh craicinn ' ( ` slapping skin ' , i.e. , fucking ) has long been one of my favourites . 
  ` gabh suas ort f\u00e9in ' ( ` go fuck yourself ' ) is another great one . 
  the book '' [ focail i bhf\u00f3cas ] ( http://www.litriocht.com/shop/product_info.php?products_id=267 ) '' ( le se\u00e1n mac cionnaith ) has a tonne of insults . 
  agreed , but i think people 's main issue is having ` british ' simply lumped in with ` germanic ' , when anybody who knows anything about the history or britain and ireland knows that we 're all a bunch of mutts . 
  british , yes -- especially the welsh -- but not germanic . 
  no , that 'd be 'm \u00edle cacanna ' . 
  thought that , and then deleted it because i was n't sure . 
  good to know my instincts were accurate . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'd say 1870 is the actual date , given the way some of the characters are dressed , particularly around the hre and prussia . 
  also , the characters are generally wearing trousers rather than breeches , which points to it being the late 1800s rather than the mid 1700s . 
  moveover , it makes reference to belgium , which only came into existence in 1834 . 
  i think the 1749 might refer to something else . 
  and yet scotland itself is listed under 5 , and ireland is n't counted as part of the uk , which it was at the time . 
  all very , very odd . 
  the question 's almost pointless anyway . 
  we 're all just mutts when it comes down to it . 
  well , given there are wallabies on lambay island , not far from dublin , and the irish sea is a wee bit radioactive , it 's fully possible that there could be nuclear marsupials associated with ireland . 
  so why not atomic koalas too ? 
  like the scots , welsh , and bretons , we 're ` miscellaneous white ' , i believe . 
  let 's see ... * neutral * direct democracy * many cantons were very late in giving women the right to vote . 
  * swiss german is essentially its own language . 
  * it 's home to a significant chunk of the remaining minor romance languages . 
  * handle 's liechtenstein 's external affairs , iirc , and i think shares a number of national institutions with it . 
  * has a rotating presidency . 
  * the country 's official name is in latin as a compromise . 
  * their armed forces still exhibit certain characteristics of the old militia system . 
  * chocolate , cuckoo clocks , mountains , knives , toblerone , cheese , anonymous banking , & c. - the usual cliches . 
  * hosts cern . 
  * has practically all the upsides of being a member of the eu without the downsides . 
  * has no capital city . 
  * not a cheap place to live .
