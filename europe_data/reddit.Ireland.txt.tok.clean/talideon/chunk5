  * like the belgians , their francophones speak more sensible french than the french themselves . 
  :-) i could think of more , but i think that 'll do . 
  i 'm guessing ... ukraine or georgia ? 
  edit : for the record , the parent commented elsewhere that they were from a former constituent of the ussr , thus georgia and ukraine are prime candidates . 
  could be belarus , but iirc , free speech is rather restricted there . 
  it does n't infuriate me , but i do have to roll my eyes at the na\u00efvet\u00e9 it displays . 
  sixty years does n't turn a continent that 's essentially been almost continuously at war since the fall of the roman empire into a single unified polity . 
  sure , we 've got a lot in common , but we 're also extremely diverse . 
  harsh !, 
  and also an exaggeration . 
  unlike rt\u00c9 , they 'll take some chances and produce or commission some interesting original programming . 
  one example might be [ na cloigne ] ( http://www.rosg.ie/en/productions/na_cloigne_the_heads_11 ) . 
  they do a significantly better job with their budget and staff levels than either rt\u00c9 or tv3 do with theirs . 
  actually , certain kinds of dna * are * gender specific !, 
  mitochondrial dna is always passed down from mother to child . 
  moreover , certain genes tend to be endemic ( specific/common to certain populations ) , thus we can use the the distribution of such genes to estimate people 's ancestry . 
  using these two facts together , we can figure out things like the original population proportions of iceland . 
  so i 'm afraid your projected image of what icelandic men and women look like is n't * quite * like reality . 
  ` low tax ' is quite different from keeping people on low wages out of the tax net though . 
  ah , no worries . 
  entirely unsurprising , especially given the ottoman empire was n't exactly a british ally at the time . 
  i 'm not exactly aware of how that has any relation to lodzdzien 's misguided attempt at sophistry . 
   no , it very much depends on the irish government 's neutrality and its offer of condolences to germany on the death of hitler . 
  that was done to keep up the appearance of neutrality . 
   they were treated like shit when they came home . 
  again , appearances . 
  welcoming them back with open arms would 've been inconsistent , and it was easier to leave them as somebody else 's problem . 
  and keep in mind that they were still deserters who were fighting in the armed forces of a nation that was still seen as hostile . 
  people as disposible when it 's politically convenient . 
   why 's that then if you were ` unofficially ' on our side ? 
  ` you ' ? 
  hardly . 
  the time when that would 've been politically advantageous has long since past . 
  i think deep within us all , we can all secretly understand irish . 
  well , there you go !, 
  on the other hand , i , as a culchie , have no issues with it . 
  and then there 's the south east , but none of them can speak anything resembling english anyway . 
  we can , and it varies from area to area . 
  generally , ` th ' is realised as a dental stop , rather than the alveolar stop used for ` t ' . 
  welsh has a similar grammatical construct using ` wedi ' , iirc from the sliver i know . 
   one of the few relatively catholic nations in the northern part of europe . 
  most people have been catholic-by-association only for quite some time . 
   the national symbol is the shamrock , a four-leaf clover . 
  nope , our national symbol is , in fact , a harp . 
  to be precise , a harp known as [ brian boru 's harp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trinity_college_harp ) , though it likely has no direct connection with him . 
  in fact , we 're the only country in the world that represents itself with a musical instrument . 
   people once starved after a potato harvest failed and nobody seemed to think about catching the ever-abundant fish in the seas and the country 's many rivers and lakes . 
  oh , people did , but if they did n't get away with it , they were lucky if they were thrown in prison . 
   nationalist catholics in northern ireland , one of the countries that form the uk , want to join with ireland , which has led to bloodshed between them and protestant unionists . 
  actually the situation in northern ireland was rather more complex than that and had much more to do with civil rights than any wish for a united ireland . 
  keep in mind that the tuatha d\u00e9 danann were akin to gods , rather than twee little fairies . 
  i think you might be misunderstanding the irish attitude to crossing the street : ours is more or less the same as that in the uk : there 's no concept of ` jaywalking ' and it 's expected that people will obey the hierarchy of power : those who can do the most harm have the greatest responsibility . 
  thus , pedestrians can cross as they like so long as ( a ) they 're taking due care and ( b ) they are not obstructing traffic . 
  it 's considered good form to use pelican crossings and zebra crossings if available , but some people are just jerks . 
  i 'm not going to engage with you beyond dealing with this :  * an gorta m\u00f3r * is what the irish called it , meaning `` the big hunger '' . 
    it was the british that called it a `` famine '' . 
  you realise that ` gorta ' translates as both ` hunger ' * and * ` famine ' ? 
  you may think you 're scoring some anti-british points by using some language sophistry , but you 're not . 
  no , they were n't * just * deserters . 
  there was a policy of purposely looking the other way so that those who wanted to defend the country , even if it had to be in the armed forces of another nation , were allowed do so . 
  virtually all those who deserted went to fight for the allies . 
  and where exactly are the political backs to slap ? 
  there are none !, 
  and there 's nothing to feel proud of in any of this . 
  most of those men are dead or near the ends of their lives at this point . 
  all it 's doing is putting an ugly chapter in our history behind it . 
  nothing more . 
  thanks !, 
  though it 's likely you actually already know this stuff subconsciously . 
  we pick up a lot of this kind of thing through osmosis , but it gets mentally locked away . 
  * facepalm * yes , you 're right . 
  well , they 'd be * two * of the responses , ` is ' and ` is n't ' respectively . 
  ` th\u00e1 ' used everywhere actually does feature in certain dialects . 
  historically is was an eastern feature of the language , so it occurred in east ulster right down to waterford and wexford . 
  ` chan ' vs ` n\u00ed ' is a north vs south feature , so you 'd find people further south using ` n\u00ed ' whereas people in north connacht and ulster used ` chan ' . 
  the various goidelic languages are effectively a broken [ dialect continuum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dialect_continuum ) . 
  once you notice the various features and their distributions , this becomes super obvious . 
  yep , it really is . 
  i 've * never * seen or heard anybody except the english refer to ireland as \u00c9ire outside of the context of the irish language , stamps , and money , but in those latter cases , it 's within the use of irish as the first official language of the country . 
  there may have been some particular reason why your parents did that , such as them having originally been from the gaeltacht or the like , but in such cases they 'd be using it in the context of the irish language . 
  the politics of the name are arcane , but wikipedia has [ an excellent article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/names_of_the_irish_state ) on the subject . 
  exactly . 
  in addition , hiberno-english has no pluperfect , so rather than saying ' i had jumped ' , we 'd say ' i was after jumping ' . 
  that 's another carry-over from irish . 
  edit : s/perfect/pluperfect /, 
   i was friends with their kids and all of them grew up with irish as the first , english as their second and all of them speak a third very comfortably . 
  and that 's part of the great loss : having * both * languages makes it much easier to subsequently become a polyglot , with all the massive benefits that come with it . 
  indeed . 
   `` the occupied counties '' you 'd have to be pretty hardcore these days to refer to the north like that !, 
   sadly , my grandmother who came to the states refused to speak irish in front of her kids or anyone else as she saw it as a sign that she came from a poor family . 
  interestingly , the very same thing happened with my grandmother : in spite of being in ireland , the language had the taint of failure about it , so , in spite of being a gaeilgeoir ( native irish speaker ) , she did n't teach it to her kids . 
  she regretted it later . 
   my understanding is that potato ( much like in poland ) is a perfect fit for climate/soil and allowed for significant production boost in agriculture . 
  potatoes will grow almost anywhere , so it made a perfect crop for land landlords would set aside for the tenants ' own use , as that land was typically marginal . 
  potatoes were ( unfairly ) looked own upon as a crop at the time . 
   calling them deserters in a great injustice . 
  glad they finally get pardons . 
  indeed it was a great injustice . 
  i think it 's a sign of the country maturing that we 're finally coming to terms with what happened here during ww2 . 
  we just say ` northern ireland ' or ` the north ' .
