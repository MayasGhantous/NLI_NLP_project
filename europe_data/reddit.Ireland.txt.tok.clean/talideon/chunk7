  if you stick purely to germanic vocabulary , you can use a similar trick with sound shifts to map continental germanic vocabulary onto english and back again . 
  however , english has adopted so much vocabulary from other non-germanic languages that the similarities with its sister langauges are obscured . 
  none of this stops dutch from being more closely related to english than it is to high german , in spite of how things may appear on the surface . 
  what 's rather surprising is how well lit-up in blue some quite sparsely populated areas of ireland are . 
  that 's quite something !, 
  dutch is more closely related to english than high german . 
  however , it 's closely related to * low * german though , strictly speaking , english is more closely related to low german than dutch is , as english and low german are part of the ingvaeonic subgroup of germanic languages . 
  they 're motivated by * political identity * , not religion . 
  people identify them in particular ways . 
  those political identities were a partial outgrowth of religious identities as , in ni , those political identities became more closely aligned with the national identities than they previously were , particularly amongst the protestant religious majority there [ 1 ] , which lead to things like lord craigavon 's `` a protestant parliament for a protestant people '' slogan , gerrymandering , and civil rights issues . 
  amongst ni catholics , there was no strong correlation between being catholic and being a nationalist , and there still is n't . 
  in fact , the best recruiting tool the ira ever got was the brutal way the civil rights movement ( which contained people from both catholic * and * protestant backgrounds ) in ni was repressed [ 2 ] . 
  things have eased since then , but it 's important to understand that the sectarianism in ni is * politically * based , not religiously based , even though there is an overlap in identities there . 
  the troubles came out of the religious chauvinism [ 3 ] of the ni state up until the dissolution of the former stormont parliament , but are not currently * motivated * by religious chauvinism . 
  on that basis they ca n't be described as religiously motivated . 
  ni politics are subtle . 
  [ 1 ] previous to partition , there had been no real correlation between religious identity and separatism , except in that most of the nationalist leaders were , in fact , anglicans !, 
  the post 1916 clusterfuck just ended up polarising people . 
  [ 2 ] and i 'm not talking about the british army here : they were sent into a situation they could n't possibly win and ended up hated by the very people they were sent to protect . 
  [ 3 ] in case you think i 'd give people in the republic a free pass when it comes to religious chauvinism post-independence , believe me , i 'd do quite the opposite . 
  yeah , corruption seems like a * really * good solution . 
  no thanks . 
  ditto for russia too !, 
  imagine the universal hilarity when the euro came out first . 
  it 's the secret reason norway has decided to stay out of the eu . 
  nah , finland is , unfortunately , europe 's ballsack . 
  the [ blue banana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ) , if you 're not familiar with it , is a strip where a huge chunk of europe 's population lives . 
  that 's true of everywhere in britain and ireland northwest of the the iapetus suture : the geology is completely different . 
  i 'm from sligo ( thus north of the is ) , but live in carlow , and the water quality tastewise is like day and night . 
  and it 's not because the supply is better ran in sligo than carlow , it 's solely down to geological differences . 
  ireland would score significantly better if , amongst other things , [ 45 % of the supply was n't leaked ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/water_supply_and_sanitation_in_the_republic_of_ireland ) , which is insane . 
  edit : added a comma . 
  i do n't know if you 've noticed , but we 've been trying * really * hard not to win it for a while now . 
  damn thing nearly bankrupt us !, 
  the uk leaving the eu would have significant problems for the eurozone . 
  why ? 
  ireland . 
  there are bilateral agreements between the uk and ireland that would make ireland 's continuing membership of the eu somewhat difficult . 
  not impossible , mind , just significantly more difficult , and if it become untenable , with there being no way to exit the eurozone as things stand , the consequences will be difficult for everybody . 
  an important difference is that the uk is n't sly about that fact . 
  you know where you stand with the uk , whether you like it or not . 
  france , on the other hand , not so much . 
  we 're not really as far behind the uk in those regards as those numbers would seem to say . 
  i also thing you overestimate how religious older irish people are : that generation started dying away 15 years ago . 
  it 's important to keep in mind * why * the rcc became so powerful . 
  pre-independence , it was relatively strong because it had a lobby , but post-independence , they became all-powerful not because of demographic shifts or because people suddenly became more religious , but because there was a massive vacuum created . 
  imagine that scotland became independent next week , but rather than having all the assets and debts divided up fairly , the rump uk made it a requirement of the newly independent scotland to buy itself back . 
  you can imagine how that might impact a rather fragile newly-independent state . 
  well , that happened in ireland after we became independent of the uk . 
  search for `` land annuities '' and `` anglo-irish trade war '' for more information . 
  suffice it to say that all that meant that the state could not afford to fund education , health , welfare , and other social supports , and that vacuum was filled by the rcc , who largely took on responsibility for those aspects of the state , along with the power and control that came with it . 
  and i think we 're all too well aware of the damage that 's caused . 
  since the '60s , the rcc has been on a decline , and it effectively lost the last of it 's power in the early '90s . 
  it has no power now . 
  sure , there are conservative lobby groups such as the iona institute who are given far more airtime than they warrant in the interests of ` fairness and balance ' , and we still have fuckwits like youth defence ( effectively the irish branch of spuc ) around , but we also have a taoiseach ( prime minister ) who has effectively [ told the rcc to go fuck themselves ] ( http://www.thejournal.ie/kenny-condemns-the-dysfunction-and-disconnection-of-the-catholic-church-182356-jul2011/ ) on several occasions since coming into office . 
  ireland is further on than you might realise . 
  in a lot of ways , ireland 's never really been all that much of a catholic country . 
  it 's was more of a cultural thing than a religious thing , which is why you still get a lot of people marking themselves as rc rather than irreligious in some way : they 're ` catholic by association ' rather than because they have any actual belief . 
  one thing we * really * need to get rid of is religious ethos in schools . 
  this is mainly a consequence of the post-independence state not having the money to fund education or to support a functioning welfare state , so that responsibility fell on the churches . 
  that lead to a. . . less than ideal situation whereby the rcc in particular had a powerful weapon to wield to control the state as a whole . 
  thankfully any semblance of that is finally dead or dying . 
  now if we can only get beyond the '' [ irish solution to an irish problem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/an_irish_solution_to_an_irish_problem ) '' thing and display more moral courage on things such as the abortion laws and other issues , we may finally mature as a state . 
  that survey actually underestimates the amount of progress made . 
  it 's likely we 'll have marriage equality within the year , and with that will likely come equal adoption rights . 
  the one thing left is legal recognition for alternative gender identities , and there 's legislation pending on that already . 
  we 're not all * that * backwards when it comes to lgbt equality issues , you know . 
  not since the late '90s : their electoral success in ireland has been based on their being a democratic socialist party , not on their republicanism . 
  that 's how they 've managed to capture significant amounts of the working class vote in the republic from ff , the socialist party , labour , and various other small left-wing factions , and how they 've been able to eat away at the sdlp to such a degree in ni . 
  do n't get me wrong : they 're still very much a republican party ideologically , but their democratic socialist side is much more to the fore these days . 
  then why are n't you counting sinn f\u00e9in in ireland ? 
  they 're straight up trotskyists , even if they 're being more pragmatic these days by trying to seem more ` responsible ' by not emphasising that quite as much . 
  i 'm confused . 
  what exactly is your definition of ` leftist ' ? 
  because both sinn f\u00e9in and labour in ireland are most certainly ` leftist ' parties by anybody 's definition . 
  not seeing lutefisk mentioned anywhere . 
  oh wait , nobody else wants that . 
  ` catalunya ' is the catalan , ` catalu\u00f1a ' is castillian . 
  this was posted on / r/linguistics just under a week ago as [ the word for the \u201e cucumber '' in various european languages ] ( / r/linguistics/comments / 1csmt5/the _ word_for_the_cucumber_in_various_european / ) '' by / u/bezbojnicul . 
  be cool , and at least credit them . 
  no , south slavs ( balkans , more or less ) , west slavs ( poles , czechs , sorbs , slovaks , & c. ) , and east slavs ( remnants of kievan rus ' , so you 're talking russia , belarus , and ukraine ) . 
  those are the major national and linguistic divisions between the slavic peoples . 
  he 's talking about [ cleavage ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cleavage_%28geology%29 ) , both [ natural ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snowdonia ) and [ artificial ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mining_in_wales ) . 
  it 's [ even more confusing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/australia_%28continent%29 ) than that . 
  that comment was the last 700 years of swiss history in a nutshell . 
  ;-) [ the irony of an irishman making a good-natured jibe at somebody from switzerland about being neutral is not lost on me , btw . ], 
  i 'm not sure ` ran ' would be the way i 'd have described the austro-hungarian empire . 
  ` held together with spit , baling twine , prayers , and epic facial hair ' would be more apt . 
  there are some people who think that * any * tax rate , no matter how low , is too high . 
  poland still had undetonated minefields back when it entered the eu . 
  greece still had undetonated minefields as recently as 2005 . 
  the fact that croatia has minefields is n't new , though it does have a good number of them . 
  our effective corporation tax level is actually higher than the effective french rate . 
  it 's just not festooned in methods to dodge paying the full rate . 
  it is progressive . 
  it 's 0.18 % on the value up to the first eur1 ,000,000 , and 0.25 % on the remaining balance . 
  jack lynch did n't scrap the property tax back in the '70s , it was domestic rates he scrapped . 
  however , yes , it was an idiotic , populist move as far as taxation went . 
  yup , i know quite a few people who 've done exactly that . 
  not my personal style though .
