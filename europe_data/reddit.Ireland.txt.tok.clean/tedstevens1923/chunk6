  it 's part of the mix but there are other things like we 're have more college graduates than any country in europe ( thanks grant ) a high proportion of which are programmers and scientists , we speak english , we in the eurozone and the government makes is piss easy democratically to set up . 
  nah , it 'll be grand . 
  what 's the worst that could happen . 
  that 's it . 
  for anyone outside ireland most of the backbenchers in government are publicans ( pub owners ) . 
  and they 've been trying to bring in restrictions of supermarkets and off-licences ( alcohol shops ? ), 
  for a while now . 
  now every time they want the backbenchers support they 're going to bring the minimum price up a bit . 
  five ** standard ** drinks . 
  one pint is two ** standard ** drinks by their weird redefining of the word . 
  so binge drinking is 2.5 pints . 
  to be fair to them they are bringing in calories on menus . 
  i can see the nanny-ism but i ca n't see the hypocrisy . 
  i think $ 14.99 is about the right price for a bottle of whiskey . 
  do you think they 're going to leave it in at that level . 
  it 's going to be ratcheted up every year . 
  i 'm with you and i was in favour of the smoking ban because it affects other people but there is no such thing as secondary drinking . 
  if anything things should be loosened up a bit , i want to see schnapps and mulled wine carts , beer and wine in caf\u00e9s , being about to buy from an offie after 10 ( how does that stop kids buying drink ? ), 
  yep , that 's what happens most of the time . 
  we do all that . 
  it 's mandatory between the age of about seven and eighteen but it does n't stick . 
  partly because it 's based on wrote learning poetry you do n't understand and memorising lists of conjugating verbs without explaining what the verb means , what tense it 's in or even what conjugating is . 
  what do you propose . 
  it 's not like people are n't looking for ideas . 
  they 've started a tv station and a radio station . 
  there 's a week for the language but they ca n't just ask 4 million people to just switch language like that and expect it to happen . 
  i met one lad who could only speak irish , he was about 90 and his grandson was translating for him . 
  i felt kind of ashamed that my irish was n't good enough to talk to him directly . 
  exactly . 
  what northern ireland needs is a generation or two of stability and fucking with it too much . 
  i miss the free massages in the airport . 
  most like the euro only 18 % of people are against it . 
  most of what you 're hearing comes from talking heads outside ireland . 
  a lot of people here do go on about the toika but i do n't hear many attacking the currency itself . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb81/eb81_first_en.pdf page 22, 
  the uk runs northern ireland ( which is in ulster ) , i do n't see what that has to do with us . 
  she was . 
  irish people curse a lot , it usually does n't mean we 're angry or anything . 
  my irish granny used to say `` shit on you '' in place of `` fuck you '' . 
  i believe it was common for that generation , not so much mine . 
  it fell out of usage . 
  anything short of equality is not equality . 
  no one 's making you marry a dude . 
  the legal gears had to turn to make it offical . 
  well hop in your time machine then and tell it to the people who wrote our consitution . 
  i think national goverments just find it convenient to blame the eu for the their less popular actions and mp 's or other politions at the eu level blame germany . 
  i 'm getting sick of `` salty '', 
  great for farming rocks, 
  i do n't see what religion has to do with it . 
  i still ca n't see that . 
  even if you 're a robot economist there still is n't good reason to do it . 
  even if you ignore the history and any sense of identity there still is n't a good reason to do it . 
  we 're better off than the uk ( per capita ) . 
  yeah , i 'd be happy just to get it out of the constitution so it can be changed like a normal law in the future . 
  also unlike most counties our nationalists are left wing . 
  we only have 4 cites , galway 's probably tied with limerick for the smallest . 
  bad roads , good tests . 
  where would we put them . 
  we 're a bit stuck for space . 
  i 'm living at home at the moment because i ca n't find a flat and i 'm not broke , on good money but flats are like gold dust these days . 
  yes, 
  ours is more . 
  anchor : politician said `` some stuff '' . 
  now we go to our reporter reporter : politician said `` some stuff '' . 
  here 's a clip politician : `` some stuff '' reporter : there you have it , he said `` some stuff '' anchor : and that 's our report about politician saying `` some stuff '', 
  it is possible to have discipline without resorting to violence but it takes discipline and a united front with the teachers and parents . 
  i saw that doc with the chinese teachers in british schools . 
  they broke down crying , although i think there was culture shock and a weird nationalist , chinese teaching must be better thing going on . 
  ireland too . 
  they fled when they saw our mighty kite . 
  oh , he can fuck up the rest of the world too . 
  i do n't think the us elections are being covered at all yet . 
  everything i know , i know from the daily show . 
  i 've heard they even let cops have them, 
  no no slightly , i do n't really mind unless they 're dictating that my nationality means to me . 
  if their nice , i 'm nice . 
  if it 's only a week i 'd limit the number of places . 
  americans tend to travel very fast like they 're doing a landmark scavenger hunt . 
  pick two or three places that are near and settle into the cites for a couple of days , i like understanding the lifestyle and the people of a city . 
  they need to do a better job letting people know they exist because this is the first i 've heard of any of them . 
  we still do n't have motorway connecting cork , limerick and galway . 
  three of our four cities . 
  just dublin . 
  to get to galway or cork you have to take shitty country roads . 
  typical mexican socialism . 
  they wanted the factory huh ? 
  clearly they 're speaking canadian , i speak a few words . 
  soory , i 'm so hoongry i 'd give a hoondred looneys for a couple of timbits . 
  lets go to the timmy 's by the lcbo , eh ? 
  is hunt related to hound ? 
  too cold, 
  ireland did into nordic battle group . 
  there is no amazon.ie . 
  we 'd be taking it from the british economy and giving it to the germans ( who give it back to us ) . 
  you should see the prices on the uk one . 
  learning german is worth it . 
  oh it 's only $ 5 . 
  cool i 'll buy it . 
  aw feck $ 15 delivery , fuck that !, 
  sweet .
