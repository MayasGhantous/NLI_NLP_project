  swimming pool ?? 
  you should come visit ireland !, 
  i think you 're underestimating how morally offended these people are . 
  it seems to be taken as an offence to russia itself . 
  orange ... not the best colour to use in any european graphic . 
  we 've all [ got some orange in our closet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orange_order ), 
  and do n't you forget it !, 
  if only they spent more time on it in the american edition , something may get done about it !, 
  that 's a racism !, 
  fact-check man !, 
  the irish weather is a [ huge draw ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/23/ireland-cool-google-data-servers-weather ) !, 
  the environment is being provided . 
  the environment is access to the rest of europe . 
  they get a good deal . 
  the smaller economies get a boost . 
  the only people who complain are the large economies , but they have other merits that they can use to attract business . 
  it comes down to what you think fighting fair is . . should the little guy tough it out even if he 's little , or should he use his nails and teeth as that 's the only way to stay in the ring ? 
  well the us can feck off, 
  yup , you got them from us !, 
  finally ireland 's animal husbandry skills are recognised !, 
  almost all those questions are about power , size or money . 
  hey cousin , let 's go bowling !, 
  looking at mid-century photos like these , the greatest change for me is the number of signs . 
  nowadays there are signs _ everywhere _ for _ everything _ , where you are , where to go , what to do , what not to do . 
  without them , the streets look much emptier , and the eye focuses more on the buildings and people . 
  you may think that , but it 's pretty important to us here . 
  you ca n't join them , but he can put a link in his redirecting his users to yours , then you can both work together to mod , promote and grow the sub . 
  teamwork is the only way to go . 
  contact / u/maxbiggavelli and team up . 
  use your subreddit name though . 
  damn , i love me some ajvar !, 
  my italian father-in-law sends it over to us in ireland all the time ... 
  i 've never asked why . 
  dr. oetker , [ nazi pizza ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24580073 ), 
  seconded , definitely worth reading , no economic background required and very very interesting politically . 
  source : am economically retarded, 
  ireland says :(, 
  ireland here . 
  * how bout a few scoops ?

  i feel the uk is like a husband thinking of leaving his wife . 
  he 's dreaming of how lovely it 'll be to be free and have more money and lots of one-night-stands . 
  but he has n't seen the shitstorm that 's coming . 
  serious question : would esperanto actually make things better ? 
  us too . 
  that 's ireland , who do we want as our head of state ? 
  because once you find a place to live , you become a smug bastard watching all the other people trying to find one . 
  then you 'll be bowed . 
  though vs cough vs through vs thought, 
  that is such a glorious idea !, 
   i before e except after c !, 
  ^ ^ terms ^ ^ and ^ ^ conditions ^ ^ apply, 
  in or out !, 
  also : ` muh empire, 
   are now cute old men pretty sure he meant compus mentus, 
  that 's a logical fallacy . 
  man that was awesome . 
  now just need it overdubbed with koyaanisqatsi . 
  all that meth has fucked up his hand though . 
  it 's broadcast on rai 2 every year . 
  i 'd be surprised if you had n't heard of it . 
  ireland ? 
  what do we have to make us a target ? 
  also , one thing you ca n't accuse macdonalds of is meat in their food . 
  love it !, 
  you got corsica and sardinia perfect , but ireland so so wrong !, 
  what the hell man , we 're neutrals !, 
   that thing in northern ireland aka ireland 's ear-hole, 
  flip it horizontally and you 're not far off, 
  be careful , you are confusing pikeys and chavs , as the english call them . 
  that 's the equivalent of travellers and knackers over here . 
  very different things , one is an actual ethnic group , the other low socio economic group youths with no morals and neglectful parents . 
  there is a lot of behavioural crossover though . 
  here in ireland we call that `` english rain '' ^ ^ no ^ ^ we ^ ^ do n't, 
  holy mother of god , fourth !, 
  we do love to chat !, 
   [ nsfw ] here is a map of scandinavia ftfy, 
  is there a higher quality version ? 
  would n't that make you a quarter irish , with one quarter each scottish , welsh and polish ? 
  edit : ok , i reread your comment . 
  something in your maths is very off . 
  how many parents did you say you had again ? 
  traffic is what will get you though , you 'll hit it way further out from london than you will from dublin . 
  viz the right to bear arms in the us . 
  ^ ^ ^ oh ^ ^ ^ yes !, 
  ^ ^ oh ^ ^ yes !, 
  ^ oh ^ yes !, 
  oh yes !, 
  and marine le pen, 
  what is it replaced with ? 
  do what they least expect !, 
  yes , his name is albaer . 
  while your point is excellent , all the news we hear of us cops hardly involves deescalation , we very rarely hear that a suspect survives their encounter with the cops . 
   humans are actually very easily manipulated with the right amount of leverage in the right place and the right time which is exactly how much radicalisation is done .

  irish here , i speak english natively , irish randomly , italian decently , german badly , ameerican at work . 
  that 's the point of this map .
