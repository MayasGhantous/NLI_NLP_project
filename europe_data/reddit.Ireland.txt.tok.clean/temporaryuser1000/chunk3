  halloween is of [ irish origin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/halloween#gaelic_and_welsh_influence ) . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ generally ^ ^ ^ ^ considered ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ known ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ ireland ^ ^ ^ ^ cos ^ ^ ^ ^ we 're ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ great, 
   whip the living bajesus ... are you secretly irish ? 
  why israel ? 
  would n't that be affirming their actions ? 
  they 'd probably be happy for a sunny holiday too . 
  why ? 
  it depends on the part of ireland , but most areas english is the primary language . 
  us too . 
  if you 're looking for someone who hates the brits that would be us . 
  mostly though we only do it to avoid the americans , they 're always winking at us . 
  so you value individual freedom for yourself and your peers , but not as a fundamental human right . 
  the right i 'm referring to is the right to seek a better life . 
  you 're already set up , what about a bangladeshi who wants a better life ? 
  hahahahaha !, 
  i love your username, 
  no , eggs are right out . 
  we 're a very chatty bunch . 
  is it true that everyone in switzerland is ready to fight a war ? 
  i have an irish mammy and an italian mother-in-law . 
  man do i get it in both ears . 
   what 's your favorite flavor ? 
  there is only one flavour : brown . 
  can you please link to a source on this ? 
  curious to know why it was n't adopted if the trial was as successful as you describe . 
   the end of europe as we know it is coming to an end sounds pretty optimistic to me !, 
  reuters is a newswire . 
  a lot of people do n't read source , but pick up on their preferred channel .

  damn that woman is good . 
  the iron throne is literally * made of swords * . 
  sitting in it is n't a good time either . 
  with an army ? 
  compete for what ? 
  i want donald trump to be elected us president , and i want berlusconi back as italian pm . 
  i think it would be really funny . 
  why ? 
  commercialisation of the moon ? 
  the taming of the shrew , a new interpretation brought to you by rentokil, 
  why did n't we hear more about this ? 
  seems like russia sending drones into ukraine is a bit of a giveaway ... 
  looks like a drag queen . 
  can you link to a photo of these people with fake lips ? 
  sounds weird !, 
  if there 's one thing we 're famous for its an old jig and a dance !, 
  we 've been through a lot together guys !, 
  : ' - ) group hug !, 
  agreed , but it would be a logical fallacy to say that because a different language denotes a different culture , having the same language means having the same culture . 
  no , language is a means for communicating culture , either between groups or between generations . 
  this is why a language barrier can make it hard to understand a culture . 
  but culture is a lot more than its means of communication . 
  culture is about social norms and traditions , attitudes to group identity and individuality , attitudes to power and social hierarchy , attitudes to art and science in whatever form , attitudes to crime and punishment , attitudes to family values and religion . 
  in almost all these areas , the us is totally different from us . 
  we think it 's not , because we can easily communicate , but in fact that just allows us to easily see the differences once we are presented with them . 
  this is a spot on point . 
  we kinda imagine that the us is similar to here because of the language , but when you visit you realise it is culturally another planet to us .

  watching cnn where they 're breaking it down to rural/urban , areas etc. 
  wisconsin is still in play , waiting for milwakee ( sp ? ), 
  inner city , potentially large numbers for hillary . 
  looks like detroit is finally starting to come in !, 
  detroit has n't come in . 
  that will swing . 
  http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/07/politics/live-election-results-coverage/index.html?sr=watchlivehpbutton the white haired dude knows how to work that map . 
  i 've learned so much about how the divide between rural and urban . 
  that magic map on cnn is awesome though . 
  `` right now , trump leads in both michigan and wisconsin . 
  if those leads hold , i do n't really see a path for clinton to win . 
  if , however , clinton wins those two states , she 'll be on track to win . 
  if she loses one of them , she still has a path that includes arizona , where the race is tight . 
  even if she does win either michigan or wisconsin , though , trump is the favorite . '',
