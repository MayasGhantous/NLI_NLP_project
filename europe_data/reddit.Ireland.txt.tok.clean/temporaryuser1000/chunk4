  a difference of _ 30 votes _, 
  i 'm european , so to me trump does n't actually count as anything more than a farce . 
  this is very true . 
  i read a lot of r/politics , which is very anti-trump . 
  the rest of the world 's 9/11, 
  the moment florida is called for hillary , i 'm going to bed . 
  seriously seriously seriously . 
  you think haha trump is such a joke , he 's obviously a mad bastard , no-one will vote for him . 
  _ millions _ of people just voted for him . 
  edit : also , given the total stagnation of the senate , inability to get anything done , repeated threats to shut down the govt through not approving funding , not doing their job on reviewing supreme court judges ... and the republicans are _ still _ projected to keep control of the senate . 
  america , it 's like we do n't even know you anymore . . 
  shhhh !, 
  shhhhhhh !!, 
  irish living in veneto here , can confirm !, 
  yup , i 'll be watching it tomorrow morning . 
  yeah , god damn old people , go out and feckin work !, 
  [ we rank no. 1 in the world for cork .

  stop menschioning it, 
  not a fan of the video on that site !, 
  the news is n't mtv , i want to see the cathedral , not have my eyes do the jitterbug !, 
  i dunno , it worked out well for batman . . 
  ahh , so he _ is _ an american after all, 
  as a non-german so without the born hatred of deutsche bank , what did/do they do to be so hated ? 
  this thread is making me feel like such a peasant for having to use my own central heating . 
  edit : we do have it in ireland , in [ tralee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/district_heating#ireland ) of all places !, 
  ah i had assumed that was disappear only mangled by autocorrect . 
  or he may be from mayo, 
   at the time of the incident , the region 's education authority said : `` the public interest with respect to equality between men and women and the integration of foreigners significantly outweighs the freedom of conscience ( freedom of religion ) of the students . 
  not strictly relevant , but interesting to see spoken by a public body . 
  this is the major cultural difference between europe and the us . 
  spoken like a true american, 
  perhaps the lack of common identity is the actual factor . 
  there 's nothing to be ` endangered ' . 
  it 's clearly upside down, 
  i did laugh at that one , i must say . 
  i find they editorialise the content . . 
  have you heard of manners ? 
  they 're kind of a thing , sort of related to this . 
  those are not statistics . 
   that could happen , he said , if the companies are forced to pay extra tax to the eu and then claim that spending as a deduction on their u.s. taxes . 
  can they _ seriously _ do this ? 
  that seems wrong somehow ... 
  am eye-rish , living in italy . 
  can confirm this , but once you break in to a group they are the most loving friendly bunch  also if you bloody people moved out of home before you were 30 you 'd probably have moved beyond your high school friends !!, 
  hello fello potato !, 
  it was a joke from blackadder , 
  found the gaeilgeoir, 
  what 's that darling ? 
  seriously , why so much rubbish ? 
  uk saves europe !, 
  but seriously , who is going to invade us ? 
  we do n't have a fortress mentality , that 's what your proposing by conflating defense and neutrality . 
  we have a non-involvement mentality . 
  irish flags made in ireland for the domestic market do n't bother printing that picture as only one man has ever seen it , and he went blind from gawping at the sun . 
  in fairness , we are [ pretty recognisable ] ( http://www.timesofsicily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tumblr_lsjnmbsmrv1qgc03yo1_500.png ), 
  a-right boi ? 
  it 's like a global eurovision, 
  this patronising article makes me quite angry . 
  obviously people with jobs sucking on their holy bootstraps could never become terrorists , it must be something in the ungodly welfare system !, 
  god forbid one should help the majority in case one in ten million turns on the hand that feeds them . 
  haha !, 
  came here to say this . 
  that one youngfella has a sparkler !, 
  til ireland is in eastern europe, 
  gim me back my biscuit !, 
  what have the airports ever done for us ? 
  hence why they always say things like oh he 's from berlin , germany , and oh hey i 'm going to london , england . 
  black tea matters !, 
  no mt st michel ? 
  was there yesterday with my fiancees uncle ( they 're local ) . 
  he told me it was 10 for a coffee , i called bullshit and checked the board and it was 1 . 
  perhaps the rest is for service if you sit down ? 
  sextapo : getting all up in yo shit, 
  also the problem is him . 
  he 's a dick . 
  i love the [ picture ] ( http://www.geopolmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ribombu13-min.jpg ) of the gunmen out for a happy stroll in the flowers , they look like they 're singing as they breath the perfumed air ... that 's the life . 
  [ munching noises ], 
  it 's written like a teenager 's piece of creative writing . 
  but then you 'd know the answers, 
  bollocks, 
  that seems rather tongue in cheek to me . 
  that 's like saying schools straightjacket students into going to class . 
  it does n't _ have to _ be that way , but it 's a core tenet , it works better that way , and if you want to go to school you have to go to class . 
  and turkey still can not into eu, 
  now we know where nigel farage got his plan, 
   why is it odd to want to untie your hands to deal with the fire ? 
  if your neighbor tries to tell you that you had agreed to the hand tie , then your neighbors a dick . 
  this is overly simplistic , untying your hands has further repercussions . 
  something we have here is ` for the good of the many ' , a concept that does n't really exist in the us . 
  ah , the future . 
  that is a terrible list of responses . 
  they all excuse or ignore the initial action with denial and feeble excuses . 
  0/10 would not support . 
  [ the elysian tower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_elysian ), 
  because they 're more directly affected than people sitting at home in the uk moaning about immigrants ? 
  because they 're the ones actually using the advantages of the eu ? 
  because their lives will be dramatically affected by the decision ?
