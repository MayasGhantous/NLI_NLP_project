  it 's not surprising . 
  huge numbers of milenials have to work unpaid jobs . 
  not long ago it was a given that you were paid when you were being trained how to do your job . 
  now even ngos wo n't hire someone until they can prove they make a net gain to the organisation . 
  funnily enough , i , an irishman , learned this from an englishman at a french university . 
  i 'm afraid i did n't get any of the books ( since it was just erasmus ) but rooting through wikipedia will likely yield good results . 
  here are some to get you started : [ french and indian war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_and_indian_war ) ou [ guerre de la conqu\u00eate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_and_indian_war ) et [ royal proclamation of 1763 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_proclamation_of_1763 ) ou [ proclamation royale de 1763 ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/proclamation_royale_de_1763 ) ( le meilleur article gr\u00e2ce a [ cette section ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/proclamation_royale_de_1763#le_m.c3.a9contentement_des_colons_am.c3.a9ricains ) ), 
  it 's supposed to convey the idea that the french were too lenient . 
  this is mainly because they tried to integrate their colonies into french identity , albeit as second rate citizens , as demonstrated by [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lgah6mn.png ) ( three colours , one flag , one empire ) famous propaganda picture . 
  although it 's likely not related , the french treated the native americans best than any other european power . 
  the indians mostly fought with the french during the 7 years war ( aka the french and indian war in north america ) mainly because in french america , the french did n't settle their lands in large numbers , save for places that made important port towns on the st. lawrence ( montr\u00e9al & quebec ) and the mississippi ( new orleans ) . 
  they mostly let the indians be and used their territory to carve out exclusive trading and trapping rights . 
  most native americans joined the british against the americans , because the british had made promises not to settle any further than they already had . 
  the americans had promised the opposite and one of the causes for the war of independence was because settlers wanted to move west past the appalachians into former french territory as far as the mississippi and britain was n't letting them . 
  in the end , the lack of french settlements is what lost them their territories which is kind of said when you imagine the implication that whatever side was willing to steal lands off native americans was the side that was going to win . 
  the [ kronstadt rebellion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kronstadt_rebellion ) really gives an indication that the original backers of the revolution were disgusted with what it soon became . 
  that did n't stop a bunch of eejits voting for them again this time round . 
  still ca n't into space :(, 
  thanks for the correction , i appreciate it . 
  the entry for irish is wrong . 
  the irish word for world is [ `` domhan '' ] ( http://www.focloir.ie/media/ei/sounds/domhan_c.mp3 ) . 
  and [ here 's ] ( http://www.focloir.ie/en/dictionary/ei/world ) a dictionary for my source . 
  [ saol ] ( http://www.focloir.ie/en/dictionary/ei/life ) means life . 
  i 'm quite surprised actually . 
  growing up we had pasta every second day . 
  he 's certainly up there from me too . 
  he 's about that tall too . 
  great guy . 
  there is a lot more to the irish american community than the odd plastic paddy . 
  yeah , definitely . 
  i 'd say ours is america . 
  we 're both former british colonies that fought wars for independence . 
  we 're both the only anglophone countries that have a republican tradition and which are n't in the commonwealth . 
  and the massive number of irish americans brings large cultural similarities . 
  r/europe is full of eejits who , after reading a few scaremongering headlines , are convinced that the end is nigh . 
  thanks . 
  why are you using gbp when the majority of people on this sub are using the euro ? 
  you ca n't have been too commited to being european if failures of the institution that represents it were enough to affect your identity . 
  the irish government has had more than its fair share of fuck ups but that has no bearing whatsoever on how irish i feel . 
  in ireland we have the term `` plastic paddy '' which describes someone , who 's usually not irish , who buys into the identity only because its popular . 
  there 's no substance to their identity whatsoever . 
  i think that there are `` plastic europeans '' who buy into the idea of european identity but are quick to abandon it once it becomes unpopular . 
  i 've noticed that in the past few months , during which the eu has been heavily criticised for its actions , that these `` plastic europeans '' have really come out of the woodwork in / r/europe . 
  it 's been really disappointing but at least now we know who the posers are . 
  sorry , but i have to laugh about how you think scotland is obsolved of the crimes commited by the british empire . 
  in fact , to irish people , the scots were arguably worse than the english in some ways . 
  it was the scots primarily colonialised the north . 
  not knowing that kind of proves his point that brits are ignorant of its impact of its empire . 
  the problem is that we 're already chosing which empires were good and which were bad . 
  if you argue for the british empire being good you have to , unless you 're happy with being labeled a hypocrite , also argue for the german and japanese empires . 
  you 'd happily make the case for the british empire in the presence of an irishman but would you really be so bold as to argue in favour of the merits of the nazis to a jew or the japanese to a korean ? 
  you 're right . 
  bad shit happened but it 's really impressive that one country managed to take over almost an entire continent and then some . 
  they also managed to push the technological frontier with some of the world 's finest scientists . 
  and even some of the bad shit led to discoveries that benefit people to this day . 
  all in all nazi germany 's conquests were impressive . 
  we 're quite pacifist as far as states go so obviously most irish people will see that conflict as regrettable , but there 's certainly no sense of us feeling guilty about it . 
  after the last big unsuccessful rebellion of 1798 , ireland sought to achieve its goals democratically . 
  after over a century , ireland slowly made some gains and set home rule ( like what wales and scotland have now ) as a modest end goal . 
  even after the home rule act eventually made it through parliament it was reppealed because a tiny minority of protestants in ireland ( mostly in the north ) did n't like it and apparently that 's a good enough reason to ignore the democratic proccess . 
  that was the last straw . 
  we went the democratic route and even then they said no . 
  it was clear then that the only way we were going to get it was by fighting for it and if we were going to fight it made sense to go the distance and get independence . 
  had they just respected their own democratic institutions , we 'd likely still be a part of the uk to this day . 
  i 'm not so sure . 
  theirs was a short-lived empire and they 're far more well defined by what that they 've done since their empire ended than the empire itself . 
  not many other former empires can say that . 
  on the other hand , japan 's leaders are pretty butthurt by their empire 's end but the people in general are absolutely apathetic and uninterested . 
  that 's my observation from having studied the empire and lived in japan . 
  we 're not a fan of him in ireland either . 
  i disagree . 
  most of the deaths caused by mao were from inept economic and agricultural policies . 
  cromwell on the other hand had a hatred towards the irish and viewed them as inferior , far more like hitler 's view of the jews . 
  because not knowing about these things glorifies something that was an absolute horror for most people involved . 
  it also glorifies imperialism in general and when people are n't capable of understanding how damaging imperialism is to those who are subjected to it , it makes it very easy for leaders to hide their imperialistic motivations behind thinly veiled excuses . 
  and it also helps with basic diplomacy . 
  brits are notorious for pissing off other nationalities , especially former empirial nations , with their ignorance . 
  it 's of course not their fault , so better awareness through the school system would be beneficial to them . 
  but only so the same history book can say a few pages later `` were n't we great for ending slavery in a lot places though '' . 
  ending slavery is the go to response for any brit trying to defend the empire but it 's one good that 's heavily outweighed by a lot of bad . 
  it 's a classic case of victors getting to write the history books . 
  since the end of wwii there has been a lot of pressure on germany to come to terms with its wrongdoings and to this day japan is constantly chastised for not adequately coming to terms with its past . 
  meanwhile there is almost no movement whatsoever in trying to get the uk doing the same . 
  it even goes beyond that , if you try to make the case you 'll be met with hostility and not just from brits . 
  there 's this attitude that japanese people , for example , need to attone for what they did in korea ( after 50 years of occupation ) while irish people just need to get over what england/uk did in ireland ( 800 years of occupation ) . 
  we already have beautiful coastlines , just shite weather . 
  british exceptionalism is real . 
  even if we accept that argument it would still be true that scotland is using an outdated and archaic term just because it conveniently suits their agenda . 
  this is n't the 19th century . 
  the definition of a state is clearly defined . 
  there 's no ranking in types of state . 
  it 's binary , state or no state . 
  the uk is a state or a 1 , scotland is not or a 0 . 
  i 'm not just talking bullshit , i have a master 's in international studies and diplomacy . 
  but a lot of the world 's countries have similar backgrounds . 
  flanders and wallonia are n't considered countries even they they 're also a political union . 
  same goes for bohemia and moravia who form what 's now known as the czech republic . 
  scotland is trying to change the definition of what a country is in order to justify the use the term to describe them but it flies in the face of what the term really means to almost all english speakers . 
  if they really wanted to be a country they should have voted yes in that referendum . 
  that 's not what defines a country though .
