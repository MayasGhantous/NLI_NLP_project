  the uk did very well by joining the eu , even if it made net payments , the value it got back by being in the single market was far greater . 
  no one is suggesting that it 'll become a third world country , but it 's undeniable that outside of the single market the uk 's stature in the world will be greatly diminished . 
  we need to stop germany from using the eu as a tool to achieve the german national interest . 
  the only surefire way to do that is abolish the councils , or limit their powers to a very limited state where they only intervene when they have reason to believe that their state is being unjustly treated . 
  all executive and legislative powers should lie with the parliament whose members appoint the commissioners from within their own ranks ( but also ensure countries get fair representation as they currently do ) . 
  in this scenario the president of the commission , much like a european pm , would be an elected official with a mandate from the european people and not european governments . 
  only then will europe act on its best interests and not just the best interests of its largest states . 
  it 's a terrifying thought , him getting the pm job . 
  if he 's going to play hard ball on the northern ireland issue , hopefully my government will do likewise in response . 
  but right now ireland is probably the uk 's best friend inside the eu , we 'll champion the uk 's cause simply because our economy demands it . 
  making enemies of the irish government when the uk is running low on eu allies would be a terrible idea . 
  that 's true and i 'm also in the same camp , but i do n't think that the economist is . 
  as i said in another comment , the economist is pro neoliberal policies . 
  it 's only in favour of the eu when it takes a neoliberal stance . 
  the single market is great for neoliberals and that 's why the economist laments the uk 's exit from it . 
  because the entire gfa was built under the understanding that all sides are members of the eu . 
  when that no longer becomes the case , huge parts of the agreement will cease to function . 
  i ca n't go into any more detail than that i 'm afraid , but that 's the impression i 'm getting from multiple newspapers . 
  the economist is a neoliberal paper . 
  their judgements on the eu are all related to the extent to which the eu is neoliberal . 
  when the eu facilitates neoliberal policies it gets praised . 
  when it inhibits them it gets scorned . 
  lol, 
  it was n't predicting the end of the euro because it gave a level headed look at the facts and made a call . 
  not because it was pro eu . 
  it could arguably be said that they were pro eu if the euro did fail , but it did not , which just means that they were right . 
  predicting the future well by looking at the facts implies that you do n't have a bias . 
  but in general , their europe section of the paper is full of criticism of the eu , since well before the financial crisis . 
  i would say the same if it were any other newspaper , but the economist is normally the most restrained paper when it comes from wild and hyperbolic statements . 
  at the peak of the euro crisis when other major newspapers were predicting the end of the euro within a year , the economist was one of the few that just had that scenario as an unlikely possibility . 
  it also has , if anything , a bias against the eu , so it means a lot when they make a statement like you 've pointed out above . 
  coming from a newspaper which is normally very harsh in how it views the eu and generally more favourable to the uk , this means a lot . 
  it is also one of the few newspapers which makes consistent reference to the question of how the brexit will affect the northern ireland peace process , the importance of which is heavily understated in most other papers . 
   ** adrift **  ** leaderless and divided , britain has its first taste of life unmoored from europe **  the campaign to leave the european union repeatedly urged britain to `` take back control '' . 
  it is now a week since voters narrowly opted for brexit , and the country has seldom looked so wildly off the rails . 
  the prime minister has handed in his notice . 
  the leader of the opposition is struggling to survive a coup . 
  the pound hit a 31-year low against the dollar and banks lost a third of their value , before stabilising . 
  meanwhile there is talk in scotland and northern ireland of secession . 
   every one of these calamities was predicted in the event of a leave victory , and yet still the country seems transfixed by what it has brought upon itself . 
  it is time to snap out of the daze . 
  the country needs a new leader , a coherent approach to negotiating with the eu , and a fair settlement with those nations within its own union that voted remain . 
  the damage to britain 's prosperity and to its standing in the world is already grave , and will become far worse if the country now fails to `` take back control '' of its future . 
   ** the sick man of nowhere **  brexit 's grisly first week , and the misery ahead , have already provoked buyer 's remorse . 
  more than 4m people have signed a petition calling for a re-run of the vote . 
  an instant rejection of the result would be wrong . 
  although we regret the brexit vote , 34m people have cast their ballot and the result was clear . 
  a straight rematch would be no fairer than allowing england 's footballers another crack at iceland , which inflicted a second humiliation a week after the referendum . 
   and yet britain 's fate is still highly uncertain . 
  although britons opted to leave the eu , brexit comes in 57 varieties . 
  the mildest sort would be an arrangement like norway 's , involving continuing access to europe 's `` single market '' in return for the free movement of people from eu countries and a contribution to the eu budget . 
  at the opposite extreme , britain could cut its ties entirely , meaning no more payments into the eu budget and no more unlimited migration -- but no special access to the market which buys nearly half britain 's exports , either . 
  voters were told they could have it all . 
  they can not . 
   the norwegian option would do the least damage to the economy . 
  it would also be the best chance to preserve the union with scotland and northern ireland , both of which voted remain . 
  the ruling scottish nationalists , who lost an independence referendum in 2014 , always said that britain 's leaving the eu would justify another ballot on independence . 
  they are right -- especially since in 2014 many scots voted to stay in britain in order to remain in the eu . 
  but independence would be painful : it might mean promising one day to adopt the euro and hardening the border with england , with which scotland trades more than it does with the eu . 
  under a norwegian-style deal , scots might prefer to stick with england . 
  the nationalists should wait to see a deal before asking for a new referendum . 
   in northern ireland brexit raises other problems . 
  one is the prospect of resurrecting the border between north and south , a dismal piece of symbolism which might be avoided if britain got a norwegian settlement . 
  another shamefully overlooked snag is that britain 's exit from europe will break the good friday agreement of 1998 , in which northern ireland 's peace process was underpinned by the eu . 
  this treaty has kept the peace in the uk 's most troubled region for nearly 20 years . 
  fixing the mess will be an urgent task for the prime minister . 
   ** point of no breturn **  who should that be ? 
  tory party members , who have the final say , may favour one of the victorious leave campaigners , a mediocre bunch who have disgraced themselves during the campaign : lying about inflated budget payments and phantom turkish migrants , before vanishing after the vote when the brexit hit the fan . 
  none of them would make a worthy prime minister . 
  and yet the very falseness of the prospectus they flogged may be their best qualification for the job . 
  britain 's next leader must explain to 17m voters that the illusion they were promised -- all the eu 's benefits with none of its obligations -- does not exist . 
  only when the authors of the brexit fantasy themselves return from brussels without this magical deal might leave voters accept that a compromise is necessary . 
   european leaders are in no mood to negotiate with their bolshie neighbour . 
  that is why britain should delay as long as it can before invoking article 50 of the lisbon treaty , the mechanism for a brexit negotiation , which sets a two-year deadline . 
  for every extra month that the cost of brexit sinks in , the possibility of a fudge will increase . 
  angela merkel , a champion procrastinator who , like her french and dutch counterparts , faces angry elections next year , may also feel that accommodating some british demands , such as allowing an emergency brake on the free movement of people during `` surges '' ( perhaps applied across the eu ) , would be possible , though she may find it hard to sell the idea to other european leaders . 
   given that nearly half of british voters did not want out , it is likely that a majority might prefer a norwegian compromise to complete isolation . 
  whatever deal takes shape in brussels will be so far from what was promised by the leave campaign that it will surely have to be put to the british public again , through a general election , another referendum or both . 
  it is even possible that the whole notion of brexit may stall . 
  a thin majority have said they would prefer life outside the eu to life inside . 
  but it may be that , when faced with the question of whether to endorse a norway-like deal that entails many of the costs of being in the single market without having a say in the rules , many would rather stay in the eu after all . 
   negotiating over brexit will stretch the tolerance of both british voters and european leaders . 
  yet the eu specialises in muddled compromises and talking its way around referendums . 
  after months of economic hardship , and a recession-induced fall in immigration , british voters may be ready to think differently about the balance between immigration , the economy and their place in europe . 
  by far the most likely outcome of this sorry situation remains brexit . 
  but it would be wrong completely to discount the possibility of an inelegant , humiliating , and yet welcome , breversal . 
  he got cold feet knowing that taking the uk out of the single market would destroy the country and that staying in would infuriate his leave constituents . 
  i 'd love to see the reaction from the people who voted leave when they find out that not only did leaving the eu likely wo n't mean an end to immigration , but easier access for eu migrants to the uk . 
  joining the eea means participating in schengen . 
  the only way they can control immigration is by leaving the single market which is what the leavers voted for but likely not what they 'll get . 
  if they do get it , it 'll destroy the british economy . 
  sounds like the other doom and gloom articles coming from us newspapers at the peak of the euro crisis 4 years ago . 
  back then the `` conventional wisdom '' amongst the savants was that there was no way the euro was going to last more than a year . 
  1916 , the first step in the independence movement . 
  if and when that movement is completed with the north coming into the fold , that 'll be the most important day . 
  that 's a mighty big conclusion you 're drawing there buddy . 
  i was just taking the piss , trying to get a rise from some kiwis . 
  i 've seen this typo a lot lately , even in an economist article . 
  those are some loyal colonists . 
  first they reject the prospect of getting rid of their overlord 's flag from their own , then they hand over trade negotiators .
