i work for a german company in dublin , almost every german i 've met has an excellent grasp of english . 
  also duolingo is a great free app and site for learning foreign languages . 
  you can just walk across the border because the communities on both sides of the border would all be of trsdtionally republican ( currently more `` ca n't we all just get along '' ) backgrounds . 
  most unionist communities are many miles from the border . 
  the peace walls are where the extreme minorities of both communities happen to live side by side . 
  ya do know sarkozy has been retired from politics for over two years right ? 
  he 's not pestering us any more . 
   yeah it will almost definitely pass i 'm confident of that , but still want to encourage everyone i know to get out and actually vote . 
  just to be sure , i do n't want the future happiness of a large group of people to be denied by complacency . 
  ireland is likely to go from completely illegal to full marriage equality in less than 25 years . 
  it was legalised in 1993 & we 've a referendum next year on marriage equality that is so far polling around 67 % for equality . 
  now everyone of those better actually vote . 
  yes , several , they 're all very very young though . 
  come to ireland to see all the lovely green fields because it rains all the fucking time, 
  got is a real global production filmed in norn iron , croatia & iceland , with actors from all over europe & america and the money comes from the us . 
  trying to pick a greatest british film is nearly impossible , until recently if it was n't clearly a hollywood film it probably came from somewhere in britain . 
  some of my favourites are definitely british 2001 : a space odyssey , the first 3 alien films , even full metal jacket was filmed mostly in england . 
  i 'd call martin mcdonagh british/irish too , born and raised in london to irish parents . 
  things get very complicated between britain and ireland , more people in britain have at least one irish grandparent ( 6 million ) than there are people in ireland ( 5 million in the republic ), 
  omg i ca n't believe i forgot that , looks like i need to give it another watch . 
  luc besson usually gets that clear by setting his films in paris , for all we know the earth scenes in the fifth element were in paris . 
  it 's probably my favourite french movie too or for more conventional definitely french i 'd go amelie . 
  it 's pretty hard to pick : * [ in bruges ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/in_bruges ) * [ the commitments ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_commitments_ ( film \\ ) ) * [ intermission ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intermission_ ( film \\ ) ) * [ the guard ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_guard_ ( 2011_film \\ ) ) * [ calvary ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/calvary_ ( film \\ ) ) there 's a bit of a debate as to what makes a film irish , lot 's of films were part filmed in ireland to various degrees that we would n't consider irish . 
  the italian job ( the prison scenes from the original ) , braveheart ( most of the battle scenes ) & saving private ryan ( d-day landing ) . 
  and two of the one 's i listed were filmed in ireland , part funded by the irish film board with 80 % irish actors , but the director does n't want them considered irish because he does n't rate irish films . 
  the guard & calvary . 
  the best i can think of is the fields of athenry , most famously [ sung by our fans ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lolgxjplfh4 ) when we got knocked out of euro 2012 . 
  [ here 's a clearer version with lyrics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr1rzssmsac ) every irish person would know most of , if not all , the words to this song . 
  there are lots of other folk songs but fields of athenry is the most well known in ireland . 
  we have a significant amount of rebel songs that boil down to `` fuck the english '' but most people do n't feel that way anymore . 
  [ the richmond hospital ] ( http://builtdublin.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/bd-richmond-1.jpg ) in dublin always looked a bit out of place to me . 
  my dad told me the plans came from london and were supposed to have been sent to delhi and they just were n't questioned . 
  i ca n't find anything online to support that though . 
  the seats definitely are n't as comfortable as the older carriages . 
  the orange trains were very comfy , but they ran them into the ground & several carriages were quite smelly . 
  all in all i like the new carriages for the seat reservations and lower frequency of breakdowns . 
  tramps of europe !, 
  well if you do your test in an automatic car your licence is restricted to only allow you to drive automatics . 
  i 've never heard of anyone doing it though . 
  google docks ( 67m ) is the tallest in dublin , liberty hall is 59.4 m & the elysian in cork is 81m . 
  there are several factors . 
  until very recently a lot of office space in dublin was in old georgian houses that had been converted to offices as they were expensive and very central . 
  however these are now completely unsuitable for modern offices as they are not wired for the networking and power needs of a modern office . 
  amongst other things . 
  also some offices built in `` the boom '' like many houses were built in unsuitable areas where no-one wants office space . 
  there is serious lack of office space in the city centre as authorities are very reluctant to allow any high rise construction . 
  the tallest building in ireland is 17 stories and it 's in cork . 
  tallest on the island of ireland is 27 in belfast , both of those are residential buildings . 
  the tallest building in dublin is google docks and it 's only 67 metres tall , i 'm not sure how many floors it has . 
  when you become president you have to give up any political affiliations . 
  he 's also way more entertaining than marty whelan , so a lot of irish people watch the bbc coverage . 
  we tried that non-human angle with dustin the turkey puppet , did n't go so well . 
  maybe we were ahead of our time , there 's a first time for everything . 
  i work it for a german company in dublin , they 're pretty great to work for most of the time . 
  i just wish i 'd learned more german in school . 
    galway city : massive hippy  the term is `` bohemian '' no they 're just crusties . 
  i 'm from mayo , kilkenny are n't even on our radar except for the occasional news story of games where they lost by 12-36 to 0-3 . 
  hurling is for munster people and people within spitting distance of munster . 
  the jackeens & antrim only play because of blow ins . 
  so the only true welsh are those within a few hundred metres of you ? 
  does this still apply if you move . 
  ** ireland : ** * dublin : heroin addict or head-up-their-own-arse posh , very little middle ground * cork : think they live in the greatest place in the world , taxi drivers picking up people from the aiport have been known to say `` welcome to paradise '' * limerick city : liable to stab you * galway city : massive hippy or actually from mayo originally ( very occasionally both ) * belfast : majority do n't give a fuck what religion/political persuasion you are , the minority that do care will fuck life up for the rest of them . 
  * the midlands : here be dragons !, 
  ya but if we invest it in something like bitcoin we could make millions in a few weeks . 
  it 's all about timing . 
  they 've just brought in an annual property tax & there is stamp duty on all property sales , but people are snapping up bargains if they have the money . 
  two brothers from luxembourg bought a 6 story office block in dublin city centre ( a bad part of it , but still the city centre ) for $ 375,000 . 
  you ca n't even buy a house in most of the city centre for that much . 
  if people would stop coming in and buying up the property we have . 
  go to london if you want to do that . 
  i was 17 , i remember drunkenly trying to buy chips with a few two euro coins after midnight on new years eve . 
  introducing an irish test for citizenship would turn this country into a ghost town , 75 % of irish people would probably fail it . 
  90 % if it 's in any way difficult . 
  well they already trust ye enough [ http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/northern-irelands-police-colluded-with-loyalists-to-cover-up-catholic-murders-8899964.html] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/northern-irelands-police-colluded-with-loyalists-to-cover-up-catholic-murders-8899964.html ) [ http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/15/uk-arms-northern-ireland-loyalist-massacre] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/15/uk-arms-northern-ireland-loyalist-massacre ), 
  [ while we were neutral , we did kind of lean heavily towards the allies ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_emergency_ ( ireland \\ ) #the _ allies_and_neutrality ), 
  we were n't at war . 
  normal diplomatic processes still applied , the us ambassador was sent condolences on the death of fdr . 
  there would have been condolences sent if britain had fallen to the nazis , but i very much doubt ireland would n't have fallen first . 
  we had no real military after the war of independence & the civil war ( still do n't really to this day ) neutrality was our only option . 
  thousands of irish men joined the british army during the second world war . 
  well we had to show the germans some neutrality after imprisoning the axis pilots that crash landed in ireland while sending the allied one 's to britain . 
  new zealand made it into the club of english speaking powers , and we did n't ? 
  i 'm aware my outrage is entirely misplaced , but still . 
  nordie accent is closer to scottish than a dublin accent . 
  donegal accent can be hard to differentiate from a nordie accent . 
  i was kind of shocked to find out it was the first state visit . 
  previous irish presidents have met the queen in britain . 
  one i think even in buckingham palace , but it was never on state business . 
  here 's to one more step in leaving the past in the past . 
  we sent a turkey one year ffs . 
  why the sudden uproar over a drag queen with a beard ? 
  although googles offices being known as google docks is somewhat clever . 
  i 'd love to see some lad trying to get onto a plane with one of those . 
  munster has nothing of it 's own , despite what people from cork say . 
  women in ireland have to do that too , but a clinic did just open in belfast so some have started going to the north . 
  were you in a particularly touristy part of ireland ? 
  most pubs in ireland are struggling to stay open , people have cut down a lot and students drink at home now more than in pubs . 
  [ and ikea seem to be having a staff party in dublin . 
  we 're really good at the eurovision , or we were at least . 
  we 're everywhere , no matter where you go in the world you 'll probably find an irish person , probably in a pub .
