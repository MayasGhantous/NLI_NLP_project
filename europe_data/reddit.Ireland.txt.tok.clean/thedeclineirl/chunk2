  great idea , the irish for europe is `` caca m\u00edlis '' . 
  i swear , try and find another irish speaker to prove me wrong !, 
  my grandmother complained that there are too many stairs in malta . 
  that still strikes me as one of the weirdest complaints i 've ever heard about a place . 
  personally i know : * almost everybody speaks english & maltese . 
  * water polo is pretty popular there ( or that may just be a given for mediterranean countries ) . 
  * the maltese cross & the order of malta . 
  they 're probably all about how shit the midlands are . 
  well this is embarassing , i thought i was in the `` 5 a day '' thread . 
  do potatoes count ? 
   world record interview . 
  30 hours and he kept it interesting all the way . 
  i had to look that up and the last line caught my eye especially '' [ an earlier broadcast of an eight hour train journey from oslo to bergen was so popular , nrk had to repeat it ] ( http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/309857/news/weirdandwacky/norway-crime-novelist-sets-world-record-for-longest-interview-after-30-hour-chat ) '' i 'm gon na have to ask you to elaborate on this one ? 
  ryanair.com just crashed !, 
  we 'd love to , but channel four might sue . 
  and we just ca n't afford to even risk being in debt to any more people . 
  i watched the bbc coverage this year , ( it just happened to be on after doctor who ) and graham norton was way better than marty , they should get geri maye in to help him with the eurovision too . 
  i 'm happy for him , he would n't have made anything of himself in rte with their shite . 
  it was very `` shiny '' was n't it . 
  we 've got this hosting thing down , we 've a village in cork that 's hosted the contest more times than most capital cities in europe . 
  we just ca n't take that name seriously , and the whole stealing our good tv presenters as commentators and leaving us with fucking marty whelan . 
  why do the bbc always have irish guys commenting ? 
  and yet we ca n't pick a good commentator ourselves . 
  aah come on lads our song was n't that bad . 
  we 're glaring at the uk especially hard !, 
  so blond beers are male ? 
  ya , one on parliament st & one on camden st. 
  i 'll have to try that if i 'm ever in inchicore . 
  zaytoon ? 
  i bet there 's something hilarious that could be said here about german sausages , but i got nothing . 
  gaelige , the irish language . 
  ( yes we have a language ) * it 's a language from the gaelic family but do n't ever call the language gaelic because gaelic is a sport in ireland . 
  * everybody learns it in school but it 's so badly taught it 's barely spoken at all except in some rural areas known as [ gaeltacht ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaeltacht ) . 
  going to the gaeltacht and living in an irish speaking environment for a few weeks of the summer is a common-ish way of learning when you 're in secondary school . 
  about half of people would go at least once . 
  * irish is only really used by the vast majority of people to talk about people when we 're abroad . 
  * because it 's so obscure even scandanvia and the world , [ made of fun of america for thinking irish was a language ] ( http://satwcomic.com/multi-language ) . 
  muesli & water !, 
  sometimes a [ breakfast roll ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breakfast_roll ) , but that would kill you if you had it every day . 
  [ hawkins house ] ( http://www.skyscrapernews.com/images/pics/1819hawkinshouse_pic1.jpg ) in dublin , is the ugliest building in ireland . 
  it 's especially sad when you see the [ theatre royal ] ( http://www.ihpc.ie/ihpc/images/pictures/dublin/bk-00061-hawkins_street-d.jpg ) that was knocked down to make way for it . 
  ireland 's like that , every newish road has a sign saying `` this project was x % funded by the eu '' where x is usually 60-90 . 
  god knows what the country would be like without the last 40 years of eu investment . 
  i was gon na complain about your shrinking of ireland , and then i saw what you did to sweden . 
  do n't mess with the finns !, 
  irish driving licences look very different to most , we 've a paper 3 fold licence , each page is larger than a credit card . 
  we 're getting the credit card licences this year but the old one 's will still be around for up to ten years . 
  which one 's the right one ? 
  and with islams stance on alcohol they 'll never get most irish people . 
  education helps too , a sizeable proportion of irelands twenty-somethings & thirty-somethings have been to college and learned to think for themselves . 
  we 're also one of the first genrations of the same age group not to have emigrated in substanial numbers . 
  ( though this has started again ) . 
  it 's a combination of all factors really . 
  i 'm on the verge of getting engaged , the only non-financial , thing holding us back is the thought of explaining to my rather large family , that the church will play no part in our lives together . 
  fivers are change , you get them in every shop . 
  just never from bank machines . 
  it was in a newspaper report that i read a few years ago . 
  it may have been counted by total value . 
  and it was illustrating how the shift from commonly getting # 20 shifting to $ 50 caused us to be less careful with our money during the boom . 
  but you definitely wo n't get a fiver from an atm in ireland . 
  i 've noticed in the uk # 50 notes are much rarer than $ 50 notes are in ireland . 
  i think it 's down to the banks stocking atms . 
  in britain if you ask for # 50 you 'll get 2 fivers , 2 tenners & a twenty ; or some combination of the smaller notes . 
  in ireland you get a fifty . 
  i 've never got a $ 5 note from an atm , tenners are rare and twenties go pretty quick too so $ 50 is usually your only option . 
  after the changeover the most common notes taken from irish atms went from # 20 to $ 50 . 
  ya forgot `` tans '', 
  ireland : best - i love my country men , and the world loves us cause we 're harmless ( until you lend us money ) worst - if we could just get a few weeks a year , preferably in the summer , when it does n't fuckin ' rain , i 'm not asking for a solid few weeks . 
  even a few hours a day without rain would be great . 
  it 's not that they 're doing badly , they 're doing quite well . 
  they 've become accustomed to a way of life that we just ca n't afford right now . 
  high public sector employment ( some say as high as 50 % ) , excellent public facilities ( sports facilities in ni are amazing compared to many parts of ireland ) & the nhs ( hse is nowhere near it ), 
  britain has a huge influence in ireland , loads of people follow premiership & championship football teams , watch the bbc & itv ( some even secretly love the royal family ) . 
  ireland does like britain , we 're just do n't want to admit it to ourselves just yet . 
  chippers would fall under too much bread and potatoes , deep fried for good measure . 
  ignorance plays a huge part too , ready meals and sugary drinks would be overlooked by a lot of people . 
  500ml bottle of coke , is 60 % of the sugar you should have in a day . 
  it 's a joke how cheap these things are too . 
  bing & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  sometimes those crazy americans put grilled beef on before the cheese & more bread on top !, 
  i 'm irish btw !, 
  well it was 8 million before the famine & culture of emigration began . 
  population fell every census until the 70 's so the island is only up as far as 6.5 million now . 
  the famine was also one of the main pushes behind the strive for independence ( there was enough food produced but a lot was exported to britain ) , so it 'd be a very different country now if it had n't happened . 
  i 'd like to see a historians take on it sometime . 
  we 're still getting over the famine , the population has n't recovered yet , 160 years later . 
  there are still a few ghost villages in parts of rural ireland that were abandoned and nothing much has been done with them . 
  in some cases it 's not even really cheese . 
  not getting sick often is a good thing . 
  but you never know what might happen to you . 
  you should always take your entitles holidays off work . 
  scandinavia in general i hear , but the taxes are high to pay for excellent healthcare and public services , so living there i imagine it 'd be worth it . 
  * not 50 % cheese, 
  there were three irish famines 1740-1741 , 1845-1852 & 1879 . 
  the combined effect of them all is still being debated . 
  culturally it has n't left our collective memory ; you have to finish your plate and always eat `` a good feed of spuds '' . 
  irish mammies have a lot to answer for . 
  with ireland it 's a combination of eating way too much carbohydrates ( bread & potatoes ) & most of the population being descended from famine survivors ( my doctor told me that , i 'm a bit sceptical ) . 
  too many pints & chocolate do n't help either . 
  hate gets in the way of getting your shit together , we learned that one the hard way .
