  and boy do they like to make sure everyone knows it . 
  me too , bulgaria has lots of hotels , kebab places & german people . 
  i do n't think i got the authentic bulgaria experience . 
  cgp grey has said on his podcast that he got several things wrong in that video . 
  is that like purgeot ? 
  i wish i 'd been able to do erasmus , unfortunately the only exchange programs in my course were to california and who can afford that ? 
  it 's the maltese you need to be worried about ; oh the things they say when you 're not here . 
  [ we 're already working a long long long game in montserrat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qhyfxdgf4y ), 
  indian ocean , no dice , atlantic or nothing . 
  we may be convinced to take a nice tropical pacific island . 
  but not the [ rapey ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pitcairn_islands#sexual_assault_trials_of_2004 ) one . 
  we settled that last year . 
  we 're thinking now that we want about three quarters of the smaller falkland island instead . 
  i ca n't help but read that as `` americans do n't know any welsh stereotypes , irish stereotypes are easier to sell '' they 're just being lazy , it 's so easy : * `` top o ' the valleys ' to ya '' * `` jappers there 's a bomb in me leek '', 
  apologies yes it is , i do n't know why i assumed they 'd counted germany as a whole . 
  essentially yes . 
  they 've got no legitimate argument and they ca n't come out and say `` we do n't like the gays '' or `` the bible says no '' so they 're just coming out with unrelated matters and trying to say they 're related . 
  it 's fixing a lot of things . 
  i 'm not a huge fine gael/enda kenny fan but this government has at least focused on fixing a lot of issues that should have been sorted years ago . 
  did west germany have 81 million people in 1987 ? 
  ya the predictions for 2020 are way off . 
  country | estimate 2020 | current -- | -- | -- ireland | 4.2 m | 4.6 m uk | 59 m | 64 m ~ ~ germany ~ ~ | ~ ~ 51 m ~ ~ | ~ ~ 80 m ~ ~ edit : misread the post, 
  currently same sex couples can get civil partnerships , but not full marriage . 
  but things are changing for the better hopefully in the next few months . 
  adoption rights for same sex couples just went through the cabinet yesterday so that should be fully approved soon . 
  full marriage equality goes to a referendum on the 22nd may , i 'm confident it will pass as it 's about 70-75 % for in opinion polls , but we 're all being careful not to get complacent . 
  yes , for some reason in ireland that seems to be the only ideology of catholicism that 's carried on into a rising secular culture . 
  in my company of 110 employees there have been over 50 babies born in the 3 & 1/2 years i 've worked here . 
  i was extrapolating from my experience in ireland , church attendance is at an all time low , secular marriage is at an all time high & rising . 
  yet the birth rate is very high due to some kind of throwback to generations past . 
  they 're still not the 6-10 child families of my parents generation ( mother 1 of 10 , father 1 of 8 ) , but 3-4 child families are still very common in recent years , which is quite above the european average . 
  catholic france , protestant west germany & secular east germany ? 
  edit : it was a theory , hence the question mark , why all the downvotes . 
  i knew that he was an agatha christie character , i was grasping at straws . 
  so i can blame belgium for making delicious things that make me fat . 
  i knew it was the belgians , even when i thought it was my fault i knew it was the belgians . 
  i know their beer is fantastic , i 've been in belgium a few times , the people are lovely and the buildings are narrow . 
  it is , but i literally could n't think of another major belgian cultural thing . 
  i 've looked it up and can now add the smurfs . 
  but all that british culture pales in comparison to ... um . . am ... . . tintin ? 
  we won it 7 times without a gimmick ( some of thos emay have been pity wins ) , our worst performance was when we sent a gimmick gay twins , or dustin the turkey . 
  the minutes silence was n't being booed , the people who would n't shut up were being booed . 
  i was at the game it was observed pretty well for a few seconds and then a few lone voices started shouting in the bosnian area . 
  these were followed by a few shouts of `` shut up '' and much shushing from the irish fans before it descended into the booing when it was clear they were n't going to shut up . 
  that being said the main hardcore group of bosnian fans stayed at the end to applaud the irish teams lap of honour . 
  there 's always a few prick 's making everyone look bad in any large group unfortunately . 
  well it was the middle province of ireland way back when and has been broken up and lost bits over the years to become east of the middle of the country . 
  it was more like , `` hey they 're listening to us & letting us hsbc input '' kind of thing . 
  we had a bad experience with the last `` union '' we were in , we 're still getting over it . 
  it better be or we 're screwed . 
  irish is an official eu language , but most irish people do n't speak it . 
  they were going to be in charge of the wine and fancy food . 
  a second chance at a referendum that lost the first time is becoming a fine celtic tradition . 
  c'mon wales , cornwall , brittany , tailless cat land ; you 're only two referendums away from independence and then another two from forming a mighty celtic union . 
  we nearly went for that with the 1798 rebellion , the french were n't able to send enough troops due to the weather or something . 
  you need to take this up with the wikipedia page . 
  and belfast was definitely a part of ireland in 1848 , unless the whole city was moved at one point . 
  there 's a big pointy thing in phoenix park named after him , the ra did n't blow it up so we must be cool with him . 
  open a hole , then pour the medicine over it and hope some of it goes in ? 
  westport is good if you can afford to move there . 
  i 'm from claremorris so i 'm biased towards buying it up it . 
  at least you 're not moving to ballyhuanis or ballina . 
  the submarine , was invented by irish man [ john philip holland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_philip_holland ) other irish inventions : * the kelvin scale * boyles law * boolean mathematics * quaternion mathematics * seismology * radiotherapy * the ejector seat * hollow needle syringe * binaural stethoscope, 
  you moved to ballinrobe ? 
  voluntarily ? 
   foil arms and hog they could be our best bet , they seem to be able to pump out a pretty decent video every week, 
  completely forgot about them , if it has to be rte i 'd definitely go with them . 
  would that cover the aussies too ? 
  they 've cancelled republic of telly , so i dread to think who rte would give it to . 
  my votes for the rubberbandits to do something themselves on youtube . 
  at least they got a flag , ireland 's got nothing . 
  i have this dream of one day buying some cheap shitty land and just planting native trees on it . 
  not sure how realistic that is though . 
  i wish we had more wild deciduous forests in ireland , the dead straight rows of evergreen trees in the coillte forests just are n't the same . 
  ya , you only here father christmas from british people , almost all irish people would say santa claus or santy in english . 
  i 've always found it weird that it was n't a direct translation as gaeilge . 
  probably the american influence . 
  it 's a dialect , but there are [ plenty of those ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_dialects_of_the_english_language ) , they 're all still english , whether they 're american english , hiberno english , indian english, 
   american words . 
  english words , american is n't a language ( yet ), 
  insane food prices in cinemas is universal though . 
  i figured east germany was probably a bit cheaper , ihave n't really been to west germany yet , i drove through saarbrucken once on the way to brussels from strasbourg , but that 's about it . 
  there are a few bare months of the year where there is n't much worth watching , but then sometimes you can make up for all that over a weekend with 3-5 movies . 
  i know a couple who use it every friday ; movie straight after work , dinner and then a second movie . 
  to hear that from a german is pretty cool , when i was in berlin i felt we were getting completely screwed in ireland on a lot of things . 
  i just got upgraded to that too . 
  i hate # d films but i like that the 10 % discount on snacks is now 25 % . 
  i 've a cineworld unlimited card , $ 20 a month for as many films as i want . 
  i live around the corner so i definitely get my moneys worth . 
  would it seriously fuck up the common travel zone ? 
  i really wish i could have gone on erasmus in college . 
  unfortunately my course only offered exchanges with a university in california that would have cost me $ 10,000 . 
   bring them back that 's where we 've been going wrong in ireland , we like to get out and see the world but a lot have had this thought `` it has n't rained here for like 3 hours , i 'm staying here '', 
  i 've only been drinking coffee for a year , and even i know to avoid starbucks . 
  there 's a great quote from father ted `` milk wo n't stay fresh forever , unless its uht milk , but there 's no demand for that ... cos it 's shite '', 
  i use the gps with saved maps and navigation works great . 
  [ phoenix park ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phoenix_park ) in dublin , it also contains dublin zoo but that 's the only zoo i 've ever been too so i 'm not weighing in on that one . 
  [ the cast of cheers - animals ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omxaen3owlg ) also the video is great, 
  actually screw the steins they 're heavy and the beer gets warm near the end . 
  pints it is .
