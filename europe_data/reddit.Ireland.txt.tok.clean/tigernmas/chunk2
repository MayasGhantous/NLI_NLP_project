  even at that many leninists today , from what i can see , see democracy as essential to the whole thing . 
  local trotskyists parties insist on multi-party democracies , although i think there was some sort of limitation on parties advocating a return to capitalism because no backsies . 
  ( a bit how like a revolution overthrowing a monarchy would n't let the monarchists organise and undo it all . ), 
  i believe trotsky himself said `` socialism needs democracy like the human body needs oxygen . '', 
  even the stalinist parties here talk of democracy quite a bit from a glance at their literature but i would n't trust them as much on that . 
  but back to the main point . 
  not all communists , today , agree with the idea of the vanguard party and even less are against democracy . 
  the way i see it workers ca n't be in control of the means of production if they have no say in things . 
  the far left is n't exactly a singular group . 
  the ukrainian crisis has split the left down it 's usual lines with mostly old stalinist parties taking a line similar to that of the kremlin but with their own twist to it and then the old anti-ussr side which does not support the russians or separatists or the kiev government . 
  it would prefer to see all sides stay out of ukraine 's business and let the people of ukraine sort themselves out . 
  if parties from the latter group seem as if they are being pro-putin by way of opposing the eu or us intervening they are usually working with sister parties in russia doing the same thing on their side . 
  for example [ this footage from the anti-war march in moscow ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3byyy4cyfpa ) shows members from the [ russian socialist movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_socialist_movement ) and the [ russian section of cwi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_section_of_the_committee_for_a_workers%27_international ) . 
  a member of cwi russia is also [ shown being lifted for protesting in an earlier video here .

  [ in this bbc piece a member of right sector openly admits to being a `` national socialist '' . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26394980 ) just taking a look at [ their own videos they reek of fascism . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-inu_-0dcsu ) / u/guantanamo also suggested [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/22ox1w/what_is_fascism/ ) on fascism over on / r/askhistorians . 
  it 's a very good explanation and i think right sector fits very neatly into it . 
  i would leave it up to france . 
  if they can get others to help them then fine . 
  that 's true but authoritarianism is a hard thing to roll back . 
  it will try to perpetuate itself . 
  i never thought of the falklands . 
  i think maybe it should n't involve the eu as a whole if it occurs outside of europe itself . 
  if the conflict is over some colonial relic then it 's up to the individual country responsible . 
  if it were an attack on the homeland of an eu member state then they should have the aid of the other member states as well as whatever other military alliances they have . 
  have there ever been cases of outside aggression against a member state from another country ? 
  i 'm asking that , not using it as an argument . 
  surely with two nuclear armed members there is enough deterrence from aggression ? 
  not to mention the close ties with the us . 
  centralisation is still my biggest worry . 
  and once you 've done it it is hard to go back . 
  it would n't happen individually if an eu member state was involved . 
  there is enough in place as it is in my opinion . 
  i do n't see centralising the military as necessary . 
  what difference would it make if there was a centralised army ? 
  there is already nato and plenty of co-operation among eu member states . 
  i do n't think a centralised military would be a good idea . 
  i do n't trust the eu with that kind of power in its present form . 
  i also think irish neutrality is a joke as it is but if there were to be some sort of euro army then we should not take part . 
  why does europe need an army ? 
  edit : right i get the message . 
  do n't ever go against the federalist circlejerk . 
  i do n't support american military presence in europe and but nor do i support setting up a joint european army . 
  [ the secret of kells ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw2_hztuqbe ) is a fantastic depiction of early christian ireland and is often compared to miyazaki for it 's style . 
  i love it . 
  i 'd also give [ once ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6xif92ouos ) a mention . 
  it did win an oscar like . 
  also link for [ the wind that shakes the barley ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhn5_guco5e ) trailer . 
  it 's the better of those two in my opinion . 
  [ michael collins ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1pkbe29910 ) is a bit inaccurate and julia roberts ' accent is god awful . 
  my cut off point would be at the ural mountains to the east and then as far as turkey in the turkey direction . 
  looking at that table i think i know which particular user caused that . 
  there 's been one maoist on the socialist subs who is a little too enthusiastic . 
  they also reddit while drinking which does n't help . 
  they 've gone through a few accounts at this stage . 
  they definitely are n't representative of the rest of the left . 
  there is a fair overlap between socialist subreddits and srs but i would say that they are still a minority there . 
  then they should n't complain when people point out the historical baggage that comes with it . 
   a `` fascist '' organization that takes part in democracy ? 
  that 's exactly what the italian fascist party and german nazi party did . 
  that 's exactly what golden dawn was doing too . 
  why not stick to the national flag if you want to express nationalist sentiment ? 
  why fly the flag of an organisation with a lot of blood on its hands ? 
  i was talking about it in relation to communism . 
  what the hell point are you even trying to make ? 
  are you denying the ethnic cleansing that the upa committed ? 
  anarchism and marxists have the same end goal but chose different , incompatible means . 
  that 's their connection but there is a lot of historical bad blood between them . 
  i know that ukrainian anarchists have no love for the ukrainian communist party . 
  what happened in ukraine during the russian revolution is one of the major clashes . 
  a large portion of ukraine was an anarchist free territory of independent soviets until the red army took it over . 
  all the wrongs done to ukraine were by marxist-leninists and the worst was done by stalin . 
  there are plenty of other forms of communism advocated by the likes of anarchists and other marxists who have done nothing to ukraine . 
  getting the border right is tricky . 
  and if you end up with people on one side that really want to be on the other then there will be issues . 
  throw in some kind of strong nationalism and you might have some serious problems . 
  splitting ireland led to quite a bit of bother . 
  in fairness anarchist flags are pretty common at a lot of anti-government protests and riots . 
  i have come across some people who thought that 's what those flags in kiev were . 
  and i would say a lot of flags are preferable to the flag of an [ organisation that killed tens of thousands of poles in an ethnic cleansing operation . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ), 
  there 's a local party called mebyon kernow which is along the lines of the snp and plaid cymru . 
  i think all they want is a small regional assembly and devolved status so that they are n't an english county . 
  apparently there 's strong support for a cornish assembly and it has the support of the local libdem mps too . 
  [ here 's a wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cornish_assembly#support_for_a_cornish_assembly ) on the proposed assembly . 
  i think one of the main motivations behind it is that as an english county it has become a sort of fashionable summer home place which raises housing prices and dilutes the small unique heritage that they still hold onto . 
  and having devolved powers seems to go down well too . 
  it would also give their culture and language a boost . 
  it 'd make things more colourful . 
  it would never have happened without wwi . 
  i wish our history books mentioned more about the broader picture . 
  james connolly seemed to get involved mainly because , as one of the most vocal and few anti-war figures in europe , he appeared to want to use an uprising to bring an end to the war by inspiring uprisings in other countries . 
   [ `` a great continental uprising of the working class would stop the war ; a universal protest at public meetings will not save a single life from being wantonly slaughtered . 
  '' ] ( http://www.marxists.org/archive/connolly/1914/08/contrev.htm ) and lenin and luxemburg , fellow members of the second international were also involved in uprisings in their countries in 1917 and 1918 which led to both russia and germany exiting the war . 
  i think it 's quite an interesting context to view 1916 in . 
  socialism is worker control of the means of production and libertarianism is about small to no government . 
  the two are compatible just like how libertarianism and capitalism are compatible . 
  libertarian socialism is one of the three main branches of socialism with the other two being marxist and democratic socialism .
