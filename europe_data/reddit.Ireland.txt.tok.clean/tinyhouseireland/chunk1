i acknowledge the problem escalated to its full size due to power politics . 
  it is highly likely the upper echelons in london at the time thought a ` die off ' would be an appropriate response , that is `` this problem solves itself '' . 
  however i think the origin of the problem was poverty and religion . 
  the former could be attributed to the english , but the second can not . 
  the fact of the matter is that we irish should take some of the blame . 
  especially the church . 
  that the island has plenty of farmable land is not the real problem . 
  remember their yields are dramatically lower than modern farming , and then they had twice our present population . 
  their real problem would have been something like ` units per hectare ' . 
  i put to you , that had the land been ` rationalized ' , in this case the combining of all those tiny acreages into much larger parcels , that the food output would have been dramatically higher . 
  these micro allotments do n't exist without catholic culture . 
  this would not have prevented famine of course , since as you stated it was primarily a political famine . 
  but ... the famine would not have been as bad as it got , even if just because there would have been more food available to steal . 
  i also suspect at least some catholics believed it was a theological duty to have as many children as possible . 
  this grassroots level sentiment , at a higher level , is a political strategy ( it is even in videogames : the infamous ` tank rush ' ) . 
  i think the english knew that , and that was part of the rationale to let us starve to death . 
  none of this goes into the history books from either side of course , i 'm saying if you read between the lines that 's one of the things that comes across . 
  the photos of the bodies were some of the most brutal i 've ever seen . 
  interesting point . 
  congratulations on having an attention span such that you 're able to read and grok an essay , it 's all too rare today . 
  scott is a friend and he has many worthwhile essays to read that explain many interesting ideas about the political climate . 
  i 'll reply by way of a little story . 
  today i was working for a old woman . 
  she was adamant that trump was a bastard in all senses , but that he got one thing right egro : an ( presumed ) american invasion of syria to depose assad . 
  the problems she declared , are `` evil '' and `` greed '' . 
  i agreed with her it was all very terrible and stated i did n't have a good solution to this and continued with my work . 
  that kept her happy , but i did n't really agree with her at all . 
  i do not believe there is any evidence deposing assad makes syria a place with less violence . 
  i recall that the call to war on iraq was partly based on appeals to our empathy . 
  i am sure you recall that saddam was a real bastard . 
  i 'm sure you remember that qaddafi did some pretty evil things . 
  problem is : these places got dramatically worse on most metrics after we deposed those leaders . 
  we dealt with a micro-evil and got back a macro-evil . 
  definitely more dead people . 
  clearly our priors were/are wrong !, 
  why then do we think it shall be any different with syria ? 
  it was n't with egypt , libya , iraq and afghanistan . 
  that last countries that got ` liberated ' , reformed , and went on to be good places to be , were japan and germany . 
  point is : leftism may indeed be trying its best to make the world a better , safer place . 
  i agree that is a positive terminal goal . 
  but it seems to be the case that ** empathy ** is just as dangerous as ** evil ** . 
  i do n't use that word lightly , nor am i applying a theological context to it . 
  still , it seems like you ca n't wish the world better . 
  i would agree incidentally that rightism 's need to ` find the enemy ' can cause problems . 
  the obvious one being unfair discrimination . 
  i say ` unfair ' , because i believe some kinds to be rational . 
  it seems like rightism has an opportunity cost . 
  it loses out by being risk averse , by not taking advantage of cooperative strategies . 
  however it seems to me that when leftism gets it wrong , it ** really * gets it wrong . 
  communism . 
  i believe leftism today is catastrophically wrong on two things . 
  genetics . 
  the reverse is climate and authoritarianism . 
  there are few intelligent right wing authoritarians and unfortunately this is a problem ( micro example : why bother telling people it is immoral/illegal to use phones in cars ? 
  just use technology to switch them off when the cars start to pick up speed ) . 
  edit :  is this where the term `` virtue signaling '' takes origin ? 
  i believe the origin was the lesswrong community , which scott alexander was a member of for a long time , under the username yvain . 
  lesswrong and starslatecodex are both fascinating communities ( silicon valley philosphy if you want a tldr ) , along with robin hanson 's blog and marginal revolution . 
  i do n't see an ethical qualm with temporary sterilization of refugees . 
  it 's a fine thing to help people in distress . 
  that does not imply for a second a refugee has the same rights as a citizen . 
  if we implemented a sterilization program and a ` right to return ' program i am certain that the right wing would actually welcome moderate numbers of refugees . 
  even if you dislike the idea i propose , it means higher numbers of humans will live who otherwise may have been killed . 
  i think that is the greater advantage in a moral sense . 
  if a refugee does n't like being temporarily sterilized or that they 'll eventually return to their origin , then it is highly questionable whether they are actual refugees . 
  i agree with that . 
  however in practice i believe there has been a ** massive ** decline in actual debate in our western society . 
  this has been going on since the introduction of television . 
  yes , people say they want a ` debate ' on this or that . 
  rarely do they actually have a debate . 
  having a debate would imply two things . 
  your position is open to be questioned . 
  your opponent may have some killer points you did n't think of . 
  a lot of people do n't like that . 
  in many ways liberals have become too conservative ( in the pejorative sense ) . 
  questions on taboo subjects are treated with the same reservation that christians hold on heathen dogma !, 
  today if you are a real old fashioned liberal , you 're kind of reactionary . 
  you could just as easily make the argument the far left and islamists have many similarities . 
  - ban on compound interest . 
  - massive state influence on the economy . 
  islam is not best understood as ` right ' or ` left ' but elements of both expressed as a totalitarian hegemonic entity with no separation between religion , state , law and culture . 
  tldr ; it thinks of itself as the answer to ` the question ' asked in douglas adam 's hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy . 
  away from the obvious i.e. 
  getting screwed by london and the absentee landlords , i believe a major component of why it happened was theological . 
  catholics had large families for partly theological reasons . 
  it 's not usually spelled out but it was definitely in the culture . 
  that had implications for how land got divided up . 
  this made land reform impossible and then that in turn contributed to the disaster . 
  the reason i mention this , is not because of the past , but because of the future of a different country . 
  in egypt , the population is now 100 million people . 
  they have two major economic centers . 
  the suez canal . 
  tourism . 
  it is very difficult to farm land in egypt . 
  there is a large amount of corruption in the bureaucracy and it requires incredible time and patience to get anything done . 
  you can not plausibly have a population 1/5 of the entire eu and have no economy . 
  it is very easy for me to see the irish famine replicated once more in egypt . 
  once more we have a theological bent towards large families , actually unsustainable levels of population , once more we have problems with making the land productive . 
  it is easy to imagine the suez canal or tourism getting damaged by terrorism or innovations . 
  just before the arab spring , food prices increased dramatically .
