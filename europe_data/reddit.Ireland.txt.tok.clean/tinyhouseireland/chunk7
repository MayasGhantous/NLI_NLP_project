  that 's the obvious solution and it will be cheaper than holding them extensively . 
  good point , we do n't want to discriminate against the good genies or it 'll start getting hairy around that third wish . 
  feel like i 'd prefer to visit their countryside than their cities . 
  countryside visits are underrated . 
  cities are mostly the same as each other . 
  that was actually the one i was thinking of . 
  i do n't think people realize they are like voice of america . 
  i had a civilized reply to this but deleted it . 
  you laugh now but the mayor of ankara says to watch out for jinns . 
  til the fbi are white supremacists . 
  i lived in england for years . 
  what has happened to it disgusts me . 
  it 's one ethnic enclave after the next . 
  it 's storing up trouble for england in the long run . 
  edit : because i spelt * ethnic * as * ethic * , although in a way that is also true . 
  yes , i would . 
  because it is a group action , not about isolated incidents . 
  i can give you an example right now from only days ago . 
  i do n't think that is true . 
  there is media funded by the state at the least . 
  of course it does n't mean they 're right . 
  the right wing itself is in philosophical agreement with that because they do n't believe in majoritarianism as a route to the truth . 
  can you give examples of `` fake news '' and `` alternative facts '' for me ? 
  i am curious what the kinds of examples you 'll be able to give . 
  i 've been listening to liberals , several in podcasts now , talk of `` fake news '' , but i feel like they are not confident in that answer to explain what has been a succession of political losses recently , i think their confidence has been undermined . 
  i do n't have time to reply with the consideration that this subject deserves because sadly i must toil away at my job , but i thought you might find this interesting : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/10294488/china-embraces-british-model-ditching-mao-for-edmund-burke.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_conservatism_%28china%29, 
  no , but i also think logical fallacies are relied on too heavily in contexts when they are of dubious use . 
  formal logic makes sense at the micro level but not the macro level , there 's a way in which it does n't scale because we have too much information . 
  coincidentally the greeks never discovered probability theory . 
  this is true of artificial intelligence research , formal systems never succeeded , they were n't useful . 
  in the real world humans judge each other/groups on sliding scales which themselves are subjective benchmarks and given the scale of states , every single state is guilty of something immoral . 
  tu quoques can not be applied to giant networks because once you 're dealing with large numbers , you start to have to use probability , statistics , or more likely with humans : rules of thumb like stereotypes and heuristics . 
  caveat : you still have the use of formal logic `` between black boxes '' , but not inside them . 
  for instance : suppose this argument being made `` poland is turning authoritarian '' is valid . 
  it could be valid , but because its source is an extremely authoritarian , actually worse , totalitarian system , i question the source of this wisdom . 
  this enables me to prioritize , which is something that is in a sense too expensive for formal logic to do . 
  i feel like if you use any ruleset , let alone formal logic , to order your world , then you start to find absurdities like saudi arabia being a member of the un 's human rights council . 
  they have now put them in charge of a commission on women 's rights . 
  although it must exist somewhere i can not explain the legal route through which this is possible , but i know it is incorrect without an examination . 
  it is possible that the saudi arabians are the world 's expert on improving women 's lives but for some reason i find that stunningly unlikely . 
  it might be that i am factoring in that they treat women badly as relevant information despite the fact there likely exist saudi arabians who genuinely do want to improve the lot of women . 
  because it is hypocritical to point to possible/potential minor problems of other nations when the people who pay your wages are presently exercising violence on an industrial scale . 
  it 's comparable to complaining that the british had labour camps if you 're a nazi in the '30s . 
  the polish people are far more humane than the qatari . 
  thinking otherwise just reveals you know nothing about qatar . 
  this is actually something left and right in the west are on the same page about .

  back with cake . 
  check out this bad boy : http://allrecipes.co.uk/recipe/37786/maltesers-reg--cheesecake.aspx  people in europe at least have been talking about human rights in a relatively modern sense since just after the renaissance , with the ball really getting rolling in the enlightenment . 
  yes , very true . 
   and honestly most cultures have had some concept of ` natural law ' for centuries , which usually implies some sort of basic rights of man . 
  it is my understanding that ` natural law ' and ` rights of man '' are actually opposed philosophical positions , at least for the right wing . 
  my point was that this `` human rights '' and `` rights '' are not the same thing , not even close . 
  the `` human rights '' is a specific list and personally i think this cedes too much moral authority to the un . 
  it closes the door on talking about rights , natural , common , positive , negative , anything . 
  some of the rights in the un declaration make sense , but some of the others are incompatible , some have implications for economic structure of the economy , or political organization . 
  the way people talk of them ( human rights ) smacks strongly of theology ( this is inevitable with any prescription - because of how legalism influences thought ) to me and that is primarily why i 'm opposed to the use of the phrase , the implication that they are a source of moral authority . 
  i much prefer the simpler creed of the royal society because it will work as a guide to western thought in all times and circumstances , but the un 's declaration is likely to find itself badly out of date whether our future is much better or much worse . 
  far worse yet , i strongly believe that it is being used as justification for immoral ends within the west . 
  a person who can put a better case than me , is eric posner , here writing for the guardian ( just to show it 's not about me being right wing , it 's a more general problem than political ideology ) . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/dec/04/-sp-case-against-human-rights the whole essay is worth reading but this stands out to me as problematic : `` although people have always criticised governments , it is only in recent decades that they have begun to do so in the distinctive idiom of human rights . 
  the united states and europe have recently condemned human rights violations in syria , russia , china and iran . 
  western countries often make foreign aid conditional on human rights and have even launched military interventions based on human rights violations . '', 
  i know , believe me . 
  the concept of `` rights '' is an old one . 
  the * specific * formulation us westerners purport to support - the `` human rights '' are quite a new thing . 
  this concept was invented by the un . 
  i see it as a list of liberal ideals , not necessarily a list of western ones , there are problems with the un declaration of human rights from the left and the right . 
  i 'm a rightist so i 'll talk from that perspective for the moment , maybe a leftist can point out the problems from the other side . 
  i agree that westerners should talk about rights . 
  i do ** not ** agree that it ought to be a list because descriptions have a way of turning into requirements and that would be a disaster for us . 
  it should be a conversation , a talking point , a stepping off point , the moment we are treating it as * prescriptive * is real trouble for us . 
  we are not an ancient chinese kingdom !, 
  if you read between the lines of the declaration , it has a lot of implications that are not necessarily good for us . 
  it assumes by implication high taxes and a welfare state . 
  not all countries will be able to functionally do that because they have not developed to our point socially or economically , that does not imply we should invade their countries for fixing them - because there is a rationale for making war in that declaration and it surprises me that more people do n't see that , there is a direct link between the un declaration and the thinking of george bush and tony blair , even more recently the arab spring . 
  hmmm . 
  this subject becomes complex fast . 
  i do not agree that the asians are bending to `` international pressure '' . 
  i agree that they have adopted * some * of our ideas ( notably communism and conservatism ) but i 'm not sure we see eye to eye on the big picture . 
  my view has been that the asians ( although different to each other , hold a common core of understanding ) have ( relative to time ) been happy to copy large sections of western society ( down to umbrellas and victorian pocket doors ) but do n't necessarily agree with westerners on the fundamentals philosophically . 
  which is fine , but difficult to explain in our context because they may * appear * to be similar but in fact it 's something closer to convergent evolution ( like how different species wind up looking the same e.g. 
  rock fish in caves tend to not have eyes ) . 
  here is example # 1 : japan has been adopting huge portions of european thought for centuries , all through which we were devoutly christian . 
  yet japan is not a christian country . 
  they are deeply shinto , even in the seemingly secular form and they remain so . 
  personally i believe this to be a strength of the japanese but that is a value judgment with my attendant bias . 
  it is almost surreal how japan has copied endless amounts of data , incorporated english or french ideas so closely that they are now recognized as being authentic japanese culture and ** yet ** remains distinctly japanese , never assimilating into some kind of european-asian porridge . 
  the far right calls the japanese `` honorary aryans '' for this reason , by which they mean `` different but good as us '' , a term of respect . 
  example # 2 is china . 
  china is different to japan and has if anything been more selective , more prone to cherrypicking from western culture . 
  yes they have copied most ideas about our economy , about our technology , but politically they have been far more circumspect ( which again , is a policy i personally favour ) . 
  for instance far from the heart of the colossal beijing apparatus , some elements of western political philosophy are taken to heart e.g. 
  the chinese read edmund burke very closely and other more recent ones are wholly ignored . 
  the chinese do not ( nor do i ) believe in human rights , but they do respect our much older traditions going back to smith and burke . 
  i 'd explain why i think they 've done that but it 's too volatile a subject matter for here . 
  the only thing i 'd add here is that their experiences of the red guards taught them lessons that i do n't think westerners appreciate e.g. 
  that universities can be at fault for gestating murderous creeds . 
  personally i think it remarkable how you have stated that a majority of the earth 's population have or perhaps should have ( hope i 'm not putting words in your mouth here ) , bent to this `` international pressure '' , because i strongly suspect there is nothing `` international '' about it . 
  i suspect what you * really mean * is the cathedral , to which myself , my group , the asians are strongly opposed to ( it is a kind of synonym for liberal western orthodoxy ) .
