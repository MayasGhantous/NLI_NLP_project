  ironically we see it as a departure from `` western thought '' , not an advancement of it , so that an asian would be consistent in approving of the `` old west '' but not the `` new west '' . 
  i think personally due to their population size the chinese have already worked through something parallel to the cathedral in their social cycles and so suspect they look upon our development of the same with some horror . 
  time and scale matters . 
  it is relevant that these people are currently using slaves and large numbers of them . 
  i 'll be back to attack your gizzard when i 'm less inebriated . 
  i have malteser cake so watch out . 
  natural law says i 'll eat the whole thing tomorrow.l, 
  the idea of `` rights '' has been around for a long time , since the enlightenment . 
  the idea of `` human rights '' is a combination of positive and negative rights which has been slapdashed together by the un and so is about 50 years old . 
  go to google n-gram and i am certain you 'll find the mentions of `` human rights '' dramatically jumps in the late 20th century . 
  edit : fuck it . 
  i 'll prove it to you . 
  https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=human+rights&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3b%2chuman%20rights%3b%2cc0%3b%2cs0%3b%3bhuman%20rights%3b%2cc0%3b%3bhuman%20rights%3b%2cc0%3b%3bhuman%20rights%3b%2cc0%3b%3bhuman%20rights%3b%2cc0 see . 
  there is a slow creep of the phrase around 1930 but still very rare . 
  it only becomes a very popular phrase after the 1970s . 
  `` human rights '' is not a old western concept . 
  it is a specific suite of positive and negative rights encoded the un declaration of human rights . 
  some of those rights make sense . 
  others are mutually incompatible with the rest of the list . 
  that is why i take them with far less reverence than the way most of reddit seems to . 
  the topic of rights is complex and multifaceted . 
  it is not a solved problem the way a lot of people appear to think it is , i find that position to be inadequate and frankly ; to be dangerous thinking . 
  i believe it is more than plausible for a version of modern ( and much more inept ! ), 
  colonialism to have its impetus under the rubric of `` human rights '' and i do n't respect that because i think it leads to iraq and afghanistan and will lead to more of them in the future . 
  there is a lot of religion surrounding the topic of human rights and that is why i am suspicious of it . 
  people need to remember that criticism of rights has been a western tradition for centuries also . 
  it is a conversation we are having with ourselves , not a universal dogma . 
  i think you 're thinking of something that is n't even a caricature or stereotype - these ideas of the alt-right , nrx do n't have much in common with islam . 
  the far right in general does believe women should have autonomy , but not that women are literally equal to men . 
  that is why they can be against women wearing the burka but also not be supportive of attempts to have silicon valley 's programmers be 50 % female . 
  the exception here is the christian right , some of whom indeed think women are inferior . 
  i see this with leftists all the time . 
  they choose `` unequal '' to mean worse than or better than , when rightists are often using it to just mean `` different '' . 
  but she had the eyebrows of a terrorist all along . 
  arrest the whole family . 
  also arrest the mom twice for what can only be genetically related dumbness . 
  prohibit from breeding forthwith . 
  yes . 
  mafia wives are part of the mafia also . 
  why is this a weird idea from your position ? 
  `` human rights '' only existed as a thing in the late 20th century . 
  you people talk as if we 've had this notion for centuries . 
  finding that angle a little hard to believe . 
  i get a sense of masochisticism going on , coupled with a desire to be dominated , controlled . 
  do n't think any of us , any political group has a monopoly on the truth , but i do think that there are times at which one group is more correct than the others . 
  i think the liberals have been right for a long time post-wwii , and they have kind of forgotten what it is like to be wrong , which is why they have been behaving as if they have a warranted position as one of moral authority . 
  you 've seen cnn and the bbc before , i 'm sure you know what i mean . 
  personally i have many strong opinions , but i try to hold them lightly . 
  it 's perfectly possible , if there are different types of migrant . 
  for instance in my country about most nigerians are on welfare but most polish work . 
  that implies both higher taxes and wage competition for some workers . 
  hard to know the full picture without digging into the details . 
   al jazeera is n't actually religiously slanted you are just wrong . 
  from the people who built their cities with slaves . 
  wait , that is wrong . 
  from the people who are * currently * building their cities with slaves . 
  get back in your fucking box zenomorphs . 
  there is n't much nationalistic ( country specific ) about the internet right wingers , that is a superficial reading . 
  what they are doing is something like pan-nationalism or pan-western-nationalism i.e. 
  the group is being defined as larger , but still exclusionary . 
  unidirectional media , most of radio , newspapers , television have always been to the left of the general population . 
  with bidirectional media , the right swings back . 
  only polandball understands europe , more than any thinktank . 
  by this reckoning most europeans must be fascists , because this is a fairly liberal place on the web and most people agree with it . 
  authoritarian measures would be firing on the boats or allowing them to drown like the thai do to the muslims from burma . 
  a centrist policy would be to put these people into detention camps like the australians . 
  a very liberal policy would be to allow these people to run about as they please . 
  agree . 
  the shocking thing would be if this was a genuine coup . 
  there 's a myriad of reasons including that one , because it is evolutionary biology we 're really talking about . 
  it is similar to how women can discern colours men can not , the sexes literally see differently . 
  there must be a large number of behaviours we have that have a primary basis in biological evolution . 
  one obvious example is how some humans are monogamous and some are polygamous . 
  society 's conventional notion is that this is `` culture '' , that feels like a safe assumption , yet that also seems highly unlikely if you think about it . 
  yeah , i think that accounts for a big part of the explanation . 
  there is no money in going to university anymore , not even for stem . 
  there is a huge cottage industry of feminists criticizing silicon valley . 
  it can be seen every single day over at news.ycombinator.com thing is : there is n't really that many programmers and software engineers in the world . 
  if the critics trained up they would easily outnumber the people they 're talking about . 
  for better or worse , men are far better at killing than women . 
  they have twice the upper body strength , they have different amounts of chemical compounds related to violence/risky activity in their bloodstream , they have psychological attributes which bias them to violence . 
  if you 're interested in more , the norwegian documentary `` brainwash '' explains most of this . 
  give a bunch of young greenhorns a tiny number of bullets or even rubber bullets . 
  then the outraged mob ( handily prepared beforehand ) guts them so there 's no need for trials . 
  neat like a bow . 
  i got that idea from `` the end of history '' . 
  it 's an idea that says democracy ( republics really ) is the last form of government ( crudely ) . 
  i do n't agree but it 's a popular idea . 
  obviously i do n't know the inner workings of the coup but the soldiers that got beaten to death on the bridge were very green , teenagers really . 
  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cnc5rxnwaaaqyl7.jpg http://www.mizanonline.ir/files/fa/news/1395/4/26/666201_744.jpg that is a clue for me that the coup was a fraud . 
  if you were really starting violent action in the armed forces to take over the government you 'd never try to do it with inexperienced soliders . 
  maybe we need to get rid of those georgians , first stalin and now this . 
  really though we need to develop ideas about a new form of government and then have a way to test it through trial and error without murdering people . 
  policy in democracies and dictatorships alike is similar to running giant unsupervised medical trails on millions of people simultaneously . 
   i do firmly believe that democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others . 
  then you can not believe in political progress for the better beyond what we have . 
  is that so ? 
  the asian states have held power in the same hands for a very long time . 
  singapore , japan , s.korea . 
  not terrible places to be .
