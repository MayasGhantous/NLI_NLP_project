  `` damaging the sense of local community/culture '' objecting to the presence of other cultures sounds like xenophobia to me . 
  `` strain on public services '' and `` house prices '' : people do work to provide the products and services people need . 
  the more people there are then the more people who need these products and services and the more people there are to provide them . 
  and when it comes to providing these things immigrants tend to be more productive . 
  if public services are poor and there is a lack of social housing then you need to look at who you are voting for and what their policies are to funding these things as opposed scapegoating immigrants for society 's ills . 
  `` driving down wages '' competition drives down the price of things . 
  right now there is near full employment in the uk and so little competition . 
  are there enough brits willing and able to pull the vegetables from the ground , stock supermarket shelves , wipe your old people 's asses etc without an immigrant workforce ? 
  curbing immigration may cause the reverse problem and that is wage and subsequently general price inflation which is not something you want when the pound is going down the shitter . 
   british worries about immigration are perfectly reasonable what are those worries ? 
  that the immigrants are taking too many jobs thus leaving many natives unemployed ? 
  or that too many immigrants are claiming unemployment benefits ? 
  given the uk 's unemployment rate is currently around 5 % neither of those things can be a big problem . 
  so what are these legitimate concerns leave voters have about immigration ? 
  they could base their trident submarines in latvia if scotland becomes independent ? 
  like before ? 
  you never stopped so you might more ... more than we have or are capable of producing even with pfizer 's viagra plant just up the river from me . 
  but yeh because of the cta we 'd still be able come over would n't we ? 
  yes , why do you ask ? 
  `` damn it ! '', 
  say the swiss government `` our people voted the wrong way . 
  oh dear what should we do !, 
  we should n't have set such a stupid referendum question ! '', 
  but then the swiss government are like `` oh wait ... '' as they realise `` we forgot to put any numbers on that quota in the referendum question !, 
  we 're saved . 
  we can just set the limit to 100 million trillion billion !, 
  ... oh gosh i hope the eu like this and do n't go all ` rules are rules ' on us '' maybe this could also be a way out for uk to retain single market access !, 
  switzerland had a referendum which voted for free controls on eu migration but they can not implement it without causing other bilateral agreements with the eu being made void . 
  so they 're caught between a rock and a hard place . 
  is the ` permit system ' what was voted for in this referendum ? 
  i see , thank you . 
  would all eu and eea members need to agree to this brake ? 
  personally i am not on the losing side of this referendum . 
  we here get to keep the advantages and freedoms of belonging to the single market . 
  the uk voted to lose them . 
  which ever way you voted in the uk you lost . 
  and you do n't need to be a bnp voter to be a racist !, 
  the fn are more like ukip than the bnp . 
  and what 's your point in comparing the number of ukip votes to leave votes ? 
  are you trying to say that ukip voters are the only ones who wanted immigration to be curbed in some way and so the number of leave voters less the number of kippers is roughly equal to the number of people who voted leave for other reasons ? 
  i do n't get your point . 
  and because of the crazy fptp system ukip probably polls a lot lower than it otherwise would . 
  perhaps with pr it would be more popular than france 's fn . 
  what even are you talking about !, 
  it was a bit harsh but the brexit concrete floor comment was meant as a little tongue in cheek following on from going off to read the comment sections of the daily mail site . 
  there are very good political reasons for making brexit as hard as possible but more weight should be given economic reasons . 
  this was the impression i got reading between the lines in the article . 
  but if this is a way of marketing an eea deal to the uk leave constituency then it will have an opposite effect on people in some countries whose governments need to agree to this brake and indeed agree to the uk being demoted to eea status . 
  it makes the uk 's least worst option ( eea ) look like a concession . 
  are you trying to tell me that xenophobia , nationalistic chauvinism and in the worst cases outright racism had no significant part in motivating the leave vote ? 
  are you posting from some alternative reality or parallel universe !,

  every time i speak online to someone in the uk now about this brexit thing i imagine i 'm speaking to a head poking out from the barrel of a cannon they 've been rammed and jammed in to . 
  now and then they give the fizzing fuse a nervous glance . 
  i do n't tend to pay much attention to the price of things . 
  there may be more money in my bank account i would n't know , have n't checked for years . 
  from here on this hill i 'm watching the beach below me and i 'm seeing the sea recede further and further in to the distance . 
  on the beach there are people dotted here and there dancing round their sandcastles with little british flags planted on top . 
  i 'm just hoping this hill is high enough to avoid being washed away by the tsunami of chaos that 's about to strike . 
  ( dons tinfoil hat ) ah but maybe the elites were using reverse psychology to get people to vote along with them, 
  each to their own i suppose but to me at least slinging yourselves blindly in to the void does n't look like a very viable space program . 
  but a jolly good show for the rest of us !, 
  good luck british people the world salutes you !, 
  and nobody thought to check before they voted !, 
  have they gone yet ?

  so why did so many people vote for the ` no plan ' option ? 
  i may for example be in favour of a manned mission to mars but before i vote for such a thing i 'll first look in to the plans of those proposing it and if that all checks out as doable then and only then i 'll vote for it . 
  now brexit may or may not in principle be a good thing . 
  but what slightly more than half the uk voting population appear to have done is aimed the cannon roughly in the direction of mars , lit the fuse then clambered in to the barrel while singing patriotic songs and waving a flag . 
  i think my point might have been something along the lines of : the numbers have changed but my life remains the same . 
  over the same period of time my rent has gone up by around that much but then so have my earnings so numbers generally seem to be on the up . 
  sporting events between such european countries would fairer as each would have roughly same population to select their teams from . 
  the superstate is a logical endpoint of the increasing integration over the decades ( maybe a generation or two who knows ) . 
  however given the greatest retardant to that process is about leave the forces pulling us together are even stronger than those tearing us apart . 
  and given the black hole of chaos and economic decline the uk has chosen to jump in to [ it appears you 've provided a warning to the rest of europe ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/08/brexit-causes-resurgence-in-pro-eu-leanings-across-continent ) .
