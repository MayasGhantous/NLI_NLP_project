do n't worry , you will get there soon enough . 
  * papalwork, 
  what are the chances they are all children ? 
  sure guinness would be bigger than ryanair , but kerrygold will always win . 
  hold on , he said he would n't resign !, 
  ireland - kerrygold . 
  [ who \u00b4 s taking the horse to france ?

  not realising the irony when they book their thomas cook package holidays to malaga . 
  could you think of a better time than when they were entirely distracted and occupied in the middle of ww1 . 
  its grand , they are like those cousins you have that you do n't see much and they seem a little strange but deep down you are family and have more in common than you realise . 
  unionists will never be happy until they have ruined everyones fun . 
  parties , cake and bouncing castles to be outlawed , all in the name of a fractured cultural link and their perceived place in the modern uk , which left them behind approximately 20 years ago . 
  is there anything to be said for another argument ? 
  this makes too much sense for it to become a reality, 
  i 'd argue that the results of the election reflect what spaniards want more than this poll, 
  misleading title . 
  makes it sound like mosquitos carrying the virus have been found . 
  not the species that \u00a8 can \u00a8 carry the virus . 
  rajoy has first preference . 
  is ireland british again ? 
  i ca n't seem to keep up . 
  would n't map of `` english '' dialects make more sense ? 
   but it is legit no , no it is n't . 
  single women wear too much make-up & tight fitted clothing . 
  while married women dress in comfortable clothes & talk about their neighbours . 
  - ireland, 
  when you went to school did you have any non irish in your class ? 
  i always felt sorry for those lads . 
  all religious ceremonies are done through the school ( communion , confirmation etc ) they just had to sit outside the classroom while religion class was on or were obviously excluded from the prep for ceremonies . 
  probably one of my earliest inklings that religion is a bit fucked up . 
  its winter m8 . 
  year round potatoes in poland ? 
  no thanks m8 . 
  which muslim overlord would this be ? 
  orgasmic, 
  \u00a8 those tasty rebelling children \u00a8 - catholic priest, 
  good to see the british monarchy at the forefront of the worlds troubles . 
  irish is a mandatory lesson from the very first day you enter school to the last . 
  there is just a very bad structure to the course . 
  it is all but a dead language unfortunately , trying to learn it is excruciating because you have no practical use of the language in your daily life outside of [ novelty ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iph4mv06lig ) . 
  the phrases in this ad include \u00a8 can i go to the toilet \u00a8 , \u00a8 i like cake \u00a8 & \u00a8 the clouds are in the sky \u00a8 . this is about the limit of the majorities grasp of irish , which this amazing advertisement hits on the head . 
  its perfectly ok to celebrate your ancestors heritage , but a lot of americans misinterpret this legacy and their stereotypic vision becomes their reality of the present . 
  its insulting when they come to your home land and shout stereotypes at you and claiming they are as irish ( or more ) than/as you ( had an american follow me around a wedding once pushing whiskey in my face all night even though i kept telling him i do n't drink , he could n't \u00a8 believe \u00a8 this and proclaimed i 'm not really irish . ), 
  it is a minority mind , but still fuck that shit . 
  madrid conspiracy !, 
  bet by the 6th day he was pulling his wire to mary . 
  maybe they need to hold a referendum . 
  look who \u00b4 s scaremongering now . 
  fuck the telegraph, 
  you are talking about a completely different topic ( the bad kind of drugs ) which this article makes no mention of . 
  arriveturkey, 
  not the same kind of drugs ... 
   will endure like it always has . 
  what hardships has the union ever faced that threatened it 's unity before ? 
  not really , it 's one poll not enough to go off . 
  time will tell how the the scottish people feel . 
  fresh scottish news ... from australia, 
  b-b-but britain is doing great . 
  if you all knew what was going on , why did you let it turn to shit ? 
  * islaminati, 
  i 'd rather have a pussy than a stump where my cock and balls used to be . 
  it 's not poland but the euro ... 
  it 's not the euro but terrorists ... 
  it 's not terrorists but brexit ... 
  it 's not brexit . 
  it 's just not fair fucking telegraph, 
  hitler actually had a plan, 
  every little helps, 
  uh-oh , no one saw this coming . 
  once a bully , always a bully . 
  colony ? 
  have words lost all meaning or do you just not know what it means, 
  our minuscule 4.5 mil population makes sure we get swept under the carpet . 
  we 're only rolled out when someone needs a scapegoat or a us president electee needs a job reference . 
  let 's replace religion with ideology . 
  its about to get worse, 
  elections coming up ? 
  why the hate ? 
  pushing europe around ? 
  you have to have some leverage for that . 
  turkey is just a fart in the wind at the moment . 
  a very smelly fart but a fart no less . 
  have another pint mate, 
  democracy according to little englanders . 
  at least the thought has crossed one of their minds, 
  being a normal muslim does not equal nun, 
  1/4 of turkish parliament to be dismissed and arrested on ties to failed coup . 
  exactly, 
  no news is good news =  < = no government is good government . 
  those figures will drop once brexit goes through and all those benefit stealing foreign nationals have to leave . 
  which foreign state ? 
  it ca n't be the state of emergency . 
  maybe the state of uncertainty ? 
  or just the state of turkey at the moment, 
  of course , fantasy economics can have any result you want . 
  1-0 then, 
  when the economy picks up they can sell it for a tidy profit . 
  you know what a good solution might be ? 
  due to lowering birth rates and expanding pension claimants .
