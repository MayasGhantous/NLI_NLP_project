you 're talking out your arse . 
  there are plenty of expats in japan . 
   a tiny apartment , expensive its not worth it this is the case in tokyo . 
  you can live quite well across the rest of japan . 
  no answers , just name-calling . 
  i can see you 're a veritable font of wisdom . 
  be gone from my sight , you little maggot . 
  ah so no answer , it 's the usual dismissive `` well if you do n't know , i ca n't help you '' . 
  what 's your suggestion then ? 
  vegetables , grain and ... vitamin tablets ? 
  where do you get your calcium from ? 
  vitamin bx , d , e , k ? 
  folic acid ? 
  some leafy green veggies have iron , but nowhere near as much as red meat . 
  do n't be silly . 
  annulments , not divorce . 
  the second line in the article even states that the catholic church does n't recognise divorce . 
  annulments are only granted by the church if it can be `` proved '' that the marriage was `` flawed '' from the outset . 
  the sarcastic quotation marks are all mine . 
  big pile of bullshit anyway . 
  i do n't want the ireland my children see to be the same as this one !, 
  this one is a fucking mess , full of corruption , selfishness and m\u00e9-f\u00e9iners . 
  maybe having to care for some of our fellow man who are fleeing a war will soften us up and make us think of others . 
  when i compare irish society to somewhere like japan , where social consciousness is so much higher , i despair a bit ( not saying japanese society is perfect - it still has it 's problematic attitude towards women , for instance ) . 
  maybe an influx of people who need help will soften us up for the better . 
  anyway it 's all paranoid nonsense . 
  we 've taken in plenty of refugees and economic migrants before , and the only thing that 's really changed for the worse is having idiots like you and taxi drivers complaining about people `` taking your jobs '' . 
  if the refugees do n't come to europe , where else will they go ? 
  and in what way will that be any better than if they come to europe ? 
  my family stayed too during the famine , hence why i 'm irish and not english or american . 
  but it 's probably because i can trace a good portion of my ancestors to people living in the pale at the time . 
  i do n't look down for one second on people who left , and in such numbers ( you apparently do look down on them ) . 
  they were essentially refugees - stay and starve , or go abroad and live . 
  they went abroad and were treated like slaves , but it was still better than the alternative , just like with these syrians . 
  so it 's fair that turkey , lebanon and places like hungary and greece should take * all * the refugees because poor us , we ca n't afford it ? 
  we 're doing a damn sight better than greece at the moment , you know !, 
  you just do n't want brown people in the country . 
  the sooner you face up to the fact that you 're either xenophobic or full-blown racist , the better . 
  why does it matter , you know where they 're coming from . 
  did you read my post ? 
  the point i 'm making is that , if all syrian refugees go to turkey , they are concentrated in one area and the impact on turkey is high . 
  if they disperse across europe , the rest of the countries can take some of the burden . 
  good for the refugees , good for turkey and other bordering states . 
  do n't be dense . 
  which laws ? 
  native germans do n't break laws ? 
  could it be that they all do n't want to come to turkey because then it would be essentially little syria ? 
  they 're trying to spread around to other countries to disperse a bit ? 
  and why not go to germany - they have publicly welcomed them !, 
  leave a warzone , go to a friendly place . 
  makes perfect sense . 
  it 's not pragmatism . 
  pragmatism implies practical thought , whereas what you spew is paranoid xenophobic fearmongery . 
  you give no solid reasons for anything , just that the world is doomed if a large group of people move from one place to another - something which has happened ** since men were apes ** and has n't led to the collapse of society as we know it . 
   ** hordes ** of illegals what are they , the mongols under khan ? 
  also , you as an irish ( wo ) man should really be more sensitive to this . 
  how many people fled the country during the famine ? 
  you 'd probably class them as `` economic migrants '' too , yeah ? 
  even though it was flee or starve . 
   you end up in asylum where you landed so the place that is closest to the warzone gets all the refugees ? 
  why not share them around the union so that we can all bear the brunt , instead of letting a smaller group of countries suffer the costs because of the misfortune of geography . 
  why are they trying to leave syria in the first place , dya reckon ? 
   if you die of old age having zero or one kid , while your syrian neighbor had four , how is this not replacing the population ? 
  the birth rate among the native population can be assumed to stay the same , while there is the additional refugees who * may or may not * have children . 
  so in fact , the population will actually just grow , not stay the same . 
  german people will still have german kids , the refugees will have their kids . 
  the percentage might swing slightly due to the higher population ( again , not very appreciably because of the huge population we 're talking about ! ), 
  but you 're still not replacing germans with syrians . 
  i 'm getting the feeling that maths is not your strong point . 
   you did n't answer my question . 
  do you really think replacing native germans with third worlders is okay ? 
  i answered your question with a rhetorical question of my own . 
  your point was that the country will be a different place in 50 years because of this , and i 'm saying to you that it will be a different place in 50 years ** regardless ** of this !, 
  i do n't see anything disastrous about accepting refugees - many nations have done it and all it has done that has been detrimental is to give `` nationalists '' something to grumble about . 
  how are they being replaced ? 
  do you take one german out for every refugee that comes in ? 
  also , the country today looks very different to how it looked 50 years ago ( as do most nations ) , so what point are you trying to make ? 
   you wo n't recognize your own country in 30 years . 
  i hate this sentiment . 
  it 's the purest of horse shit . 
  how many refugees do you think it would take to drastically change a country of 80 million people ? 
  and even if it did change it , why do you think it would change it for the worse ? 
  maybe subconsciously . 
  also just the stereotypical view of a sexy french woman with cigarette , disdainfully tapping her ash onto the ground . 
  also , lots of people smoke in paris , and flick their ash on the ground . 
  to be fair , i think it 's very hard to pull together a map like this accurately . 
  especially if they 're self-reported surveys , and also they do n't really express sparsity of population very well . 
  exaggerated amount of irish-speaking areas in ireland , to be honest . 
  it 's not that much of the country . 
  accurate enough in the areas , just not the size of the areas . 
  ... and drinking all your beer and whiskey . 
  saving you from yourself . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  i got 4 inches of steel that will change your mind . 
  that was my first reaction as well . 
  the only problem i have is :  2 . 
  measure her arousal . 
  how do ? 
  and more importantly : how do reliably ? 
   pronounce every vowel like it 's a ` u ' .
