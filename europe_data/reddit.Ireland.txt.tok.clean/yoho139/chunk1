i grew up speaking portuguese at home - i learned it in school as a first language like english . 
  grammar and syntax rules are important , and they 're not the kind of think you can pick up ( or at least not as well ) through immersion as you can through formal education . 
  no problem , let me know if you 'd like any more info or have more questions . 
  i got an exemption for the junior and leaving certs , as well as the one for nuis ( even though i ended up not needing it ) . 
  both my parents are portuguese and i moved here when i was 2 , so i grew up speaking english and irish . 
  however , there were a lot of special conditions that resulted in my being able to study portuguese instead of english . 
  i 'd suggest that , if you want him to study spanish at school , you look for a school that can offer first language tuition ( unless you 're under the same special conditions , that 's probably going to be a private school ) now . 
  as for his wanting to study irish , i 'd suggest you do n't give him that as an option - he might resent you for it if he later ends up having difficulty with it and remembers being given the option . 
  if you 've got any doubts about qualifying for exemptions , though , you should try and find information from the department of education , or just contact them . 
  * can i go to the toilet ? 
  * that would be about all my irish . 
  lived here most of my life , i 'm culturally more irish than portuguese . 
  like a true irishman , i know very little irish !, 
  if that 's some weird term for portuguese , i suggest you mouse over my flair :p, 
  let 's be honest , i 'd sooner trust some random person online than translate for chinese , so . . :p, 
  no , actually , that 's the exact opposite meaning . 
  i 'm not saying you put it in wrong , it 's just translate . 
  yet google translate says `` like a deep beautiful tattoo ! '', 
  we ca n't all be perfect :'(, 
  yeah , 24k learners registered for it at the moment . 
  we 'll have to wait and see just how well it works in practice , though , and people generally are n't very proactive about learning irish - no one sees a point to it . 
  ( i 'm not saying that 's my point of view , btw ), 
  nope , it 's set to dvorak . 
  i 'd need grave , acute , circumflex , tilde and cedilla anyway , most of which are n't on irish ones . 
  that 's why i ~ ~ copied ~ ~ wrote the characters instead of the pin yin . 
  not really . 
  most people learn it in school ( i had an exemption , learning portuguese instead since i 'm portuguese ) but never do anything with it . 
  most of them have a functional level of fluency in it ( as much as they might try to convince you otherwise ) and there 's some areas where irish is considered the first language , called [ * gaeltacht * areas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaeltacht#gaeltachta.c3.ad_in_the_republic_of_ireland ) . 
  \u597d\u4e3b\u610f \uff01 * excellent idea !, 
  the only problem is that i 've got an english keyboard ... no accents !, 
  do you mean to tell me you do n't get it ? 
  oh , silly you !, 
  haha yes , i get your joke . 
  nope , does n't look even slightly irish . 
  yeah , i ca n't remember what the max speed of the alfa is , but it barely goes faster than the ic . 
  i 've ridden it to and from porto , but not past it , i forgot it does n't stop in porto . 
  there 's already * cough sort of cough * high speed rail from lisbon to porto and faro . 
  i can hear nimbyers already arguing that the trains would scare the wildlife or something . 
  [ not really though ] ( http://gizmodo.com/5899569/how-many-nukes-would-it-take-to-blow-up-the-entire-planet ) . 
  there 's currently way less than necessary which are active . 
  even at the peak number , there were n't enough powerful ones . 
  fallout yes , as mentioned in another reply . 
  true , i remember reading an article about a similar thing a while back - i 'd forgotten that aspect . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're just using hyperbole or you do n't know the area a nuke can affect , but there 's not enough nukes in the world as a whole to do that . 
  it 's an illustration of the national identity , not the hdi . 
  onus of truth falls on the claimant , so you 'd have to actually provide some reason for that title first . 
  really low effort trolling there , buddy . 
  it weighs 200 tons , you do n't want to raise something that heavy , expensive and probably reasonably fragile any more than strictly necessary . 
  1.2 x the amount of dutch died proportionately to americans , 189/16819595 vs. 2977/318400000 ( 2014 pop . 
  ) , and i can imagine the difference being made up by american population growth since 2001 .

  to be fair , if you look at the [ actual numbers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global-warming_potential#values ) it 's still pretty bad . 
  ( if they leak or are improperly disposed of ) but yes , you 're right . 
  i think the cost of the electricity needed is more of a deterrent , though . 
  more of an irony thing , or at least it is here . 
  oh , i know , i 'm just explaining his reasoning . 
  symbolism is a pretty natural thing for humans . 
  generally the big hubbub around burning flags is viewed as a more american thing . 
  i could n't really care less if either of my countries had their flags burned .

  as a portuguese person living in ireland , where hair gel was popular until fairly recently ... 
  there 's ** everything ** wrong with hair gel when it 's done wrong , which is 99 % of the time . 
  i do n't think it 's particularly in the supermarkets ' interest to not sell alcohol , so your litigious nature is fairly misdirected there . 
  your video link seems to be broken . 
  i 've been very enthusiastically preached to about the scientific wonder of homeopathy by a rather intelligent ( at least in other aspects ) french lady , so i 'll disagree with you on that one . 
  pg 23 : yeah , sure . 
  i 'd still rather compare figures that are n't separated by just under half a generation and widespread access to reasonable internet . 
  pg 29 : the sort of people who say science is a force for good but that we do n't trust faith enough are the kind who believe in homeopathy , in my experience . 
  so i do n't know how much weight i 'd put on those figures . 
  pg 31 , 32 : like i said , i was just pointing out figures i thought were unusual . 
  if we were never allowed to go off topic , this entire thread would n't be here . 
   when the original huffpo article was linked that only showed us statistics it was very heavily upvoted and used as evidence of american stupidity . 
  are you suggesting that would happen elsewhere on reddit ? 
  get me a country by country breakdown that actually includes my country and/or most of the eu and i 'll give you that . 
  in the meanwhile , it 's complete over the eu , which is n't even comparable as a whole to the us , like i said above . 
  are there stupid people everywhere ? 
  also , how much that post was upvoted or not is fairly irrelevant to me - it 's not the sort of thing i generally give two shits about , exactly because of the perceived elitism that comes with it . 
  pg 23 : poorer nations develop rapidly after joining the eu , which increases education levels , which increases that figure , especially considering that they 're the most likely to have brought it down in the first place . 
  pg 29 : the list of countries that have a higher rate of agreement with that statement and are in the eu is : * austria * slovenia ( roughly the same ) * latvia ( roughly the same ) * spain meanwhile , there 's 10 countries with higher rates of disagreement and lower ones of agreement . 
  i do n't think i 'd call that plenty with a worse breakdown . 
  pg 31 , 32 : yes , i was just pointing out things that stood out to me , which such a huge trust in your military does . 
  pg 32 : your point with the colonel and cosmology seems a rather poor one - i 'm not even sure what you 're getting at . 
  while i did n't read it , i 'll assume you 're right . 
  however , you can never really compare the eu ( or averages ) to the usa and claim it 's apples to apples . 
  you can come closer , sure , but there 's way too much cultural difference from country to country ( across landmasses and populations that are easily less than a single us state ) to assume homogenisation to the degree that taking an average of eu results does . 
  i 've seen enough of those `` xyz people are so stupid '' videos , followed by hundreds of clips where they show the cut out parts where people got it right . 
  between that and twisting the stats  25 % of people asked think your military is underfunded as opposed to  75 % of people do n't think the military is underfunded i 'm well aware of what 's bullshit or not . 
  just a few things i picked up on as i skimmed through that . 
  pg 23 : i 'd like to point out that they asked in the eu in 2005 , while in the usa they asked in 2012 . 
  without knowing the figures in the same year , it 's not much of a comparison . 
  8 percentage point difference is n't incredible after 7 years . 
  pg 29 : a larger proportion of people asked think you confide too often in science and not enough in faith . 
  aaallrighty then . 
  pg 31 : 25 % of people asked think your military is underfunded . 
  a bit more think it 's overfunded , practically all the rest think it 's about right . 
  seems a bit excessive , but whatever . 
  pg 32 : you trust your military more than your scientists ( and , in fact , any other institution asked about ) . 
  a bit disconcerting , i 'd say .
