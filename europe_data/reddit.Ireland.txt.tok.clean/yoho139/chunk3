  the possible answers were germany about 8 times and `` i 'm german and this is n't funny '' . 
  iirc , more people answered the latter than said they were german in the last survey . 
  which does n't apply , because i somehow doubt the us would come into ireland to save us from terrorists anyway . 
  and useful ones ( though yes , the negatives outweigh any meagre positives , in any case ) . 
  what positives is there in being spied on by a foreign government ? 
  which is why i 'm talking about the outrage here . 
  no one wants to be spied on , but i 'd rather be spied on by the government my country voted in , so that there 's even the slightest amount of control . 
  i 'm fairly certain the outrage is not about the spying , but the fact that us is spying on civilians outside its borders ( as well as officials , but that tends to be considered commonplace or expected ) , whereas france seems to be spying on its own people only . 
  i think i 've read about that on here before . 
  pretty sure everyone who 's ever gone on reddit knows about mkultra . 
  man , that sounds familiar . 
  are you me ? 
  and being 18 magically makes you capable ? 
  maturity in various aspects is not attached to age past a certain point ( i.e. 
  once mental development is mostly complete ) . 
  accepting 18 as an arbitrary `` now you can do things '' for some things but not 16 for othersmakes no sense . 
  because every european redditor is on / r/europe . 
  i do n't care for its honour ( i 'm not irish , for one ) nor your opinion of its tax laws . 
  claiming that it 's a tax haven when it 's not , however , does bug me . 
  exactly in the same way it would if the same claims were being made under the same conditions for any other country . 
  funds are being legally routed and legally processed , with transparency . 
  not quite , in other words . 
  and , as stated above , that does not make it a tax haven . 
  everyone i know calls it `` the gah '' . 
  most of them play one or more of the sports . 
  a meath thing , maybe . 
  it does have to be covered in one or the other . 
  it should be covered in both , but it 's covered in neither . 
  or about defining features of any population save the english , americans and irish . 
  i doubt many people learned about japan 's involvement in wwii ( toward china ) from jc history , or about apartheid ... 
  the list goes on . 
  true . 
  i was hardly going to list everything off , though . 
  even about europe . 
  hell , the eec was only mentioned in passing . 
  the history classes were pretty bad though . 
  pretty much all about world war 2 and then a load of irish and english history with a bit of ancient civilizations and the explorations thrown in . 
  you either studied something outside the country that happened between 400 and 2000 years ago , or you studied something and ireland and england between 50 and 200 years ago . 
  and then people complain about stereotypes . 
  we do n't have enough stuff to discuss if we do n't . 
  what 's in yours ? 
  ** ireland ** tds ( equivalent of a minister of parliament ) have been receiving death threats due their pro-choice stance on some abortion legislation coming up soon .

  - [ comments ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1gfhdr/2000_cara_aige_ar_facebook/ ) ( a good few of them in irish ) [ another commenter on this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ggxig/sunday_european_news_series_what_happened_in_your/cak3y4g ) mentioned some things i did n't . 
  from major nelson 's interviews , selling games is opt-in for the publisher . 
  he says `` if they want to do that , we can work with them and figure something out '' . 
  your sentence would have to be changed to `` not necessarily possible '' or `` not guaranteed to be possible '' to be correct , but it 's not far from the truth . 
  which is why saying `` you can sell used games '' when referring to the ps4 is correct , while it is not for the xbone . 
  `` you may be able to sell used games * if * a publisher wants you to be able to , * if * microsoft allows them to '' is the best you can do for the xbone . 
  it 's a good place to start . 
  i know , i get tv cabo here . 
  that 's certainly a strong accent ... 
  funny , i said the exact same thing about romanian in this thread ( i 'm portuguese ) . 
  as a portuguese person living in ireland ... 
  the portuguese have the irish beat there !, 
  we can sit and complain about things for hours on end . 
  literally . 
  i can see where he 's coming from , though . 
  romanian sounds remarkably similar - i almost feel like i should understand sometimes . 
  i just assumed the vatican now had a star wars style at-at . 
  it means you do n't understand the units . 
  it 's officers per 100000 people . 
  you ca n't just add them up . 
  the images show real bullet casings , as well as claim that a protestor was shot in the head with a real bullet ( from the amount of blood , i 'm very inclined to believe that ) . 
  probably would n't make a distance . 
  most of them would know where and what germany is ( i hope ) and that does n't stop them . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1g473m/reurope_what_web_services_based_in_europe_do_you/cagq0sf whether it 's owned by nokia or not , it 's under their jurisdiction eventually . 
  client data is sensitive data . 
  seems more like they 're ok with it , so long as it 's indirect . 
  that , or they 're just homophobic . 
  likely not . 
  it 's occasionally mentioned on the subreddit and the majority seem to be against when it is , though . 
  are you looking at the same post as me ? 
  people are voting against abolition in favour of reform . 
  [ citation . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1fsu3a/so_the_gov_want_the_seanad_removed_does_anyone/ ), 
  not sure where you got the `` so bad '' idea from . 
  most of / r/ireland seems to be against its abolishment . 
  / r/firstworldanarchists i 'm pretty sure making tea with just milk is actually a thing in asia , however . 
  ninjaedit : yep , it is . 
  they actually might not , as a stylistic thing . 
  judging by all the other labels in english , however , it 's likely not a french supermarket . 
  i prefer just making my tea with milk and no water . 
  there are some incredibly good steaks at lidl . 
  cheaper than the butcher and easily as good as some of their better cuts . 
  europe is trying to regulate google 's actions in europe , not abroad . 
  the important part of my question : why should europe have regulatory power in africa ? 
  what does the eu have to do with the business practices outside europe that do n't affect europe ? 
  it 's an abbreviation for `` faire de la publicit\u00e9 '' , i.e. 
  publicity . 
  interesting , i did n't realise that was the case .
