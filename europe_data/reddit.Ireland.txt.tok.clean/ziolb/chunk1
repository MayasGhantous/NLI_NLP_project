  [ eu aid cheese is best cheese . 
   there is no such thing as a european citizenship . 
  i suppose he means eu citizenship . 
   any person who holds the nationality of an eu country is automatically also an eu citizen . 
  eu citizenship is additional to and does not replace national citizenship . 
  it is for each eu country to lay down the conditions for the acquisition and loss of nationality of that country . 
  citizenship of the eu is conferred directly on every eu citizen by the treaty on the functioning of the eu . 
  the british empire 's legacy in ireland , everyone :(, 
  [ not to mention this classic with the hungarian pm . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt9prne9wf0 ), 
   hat made people able to come together for this agreement in the first place ? 
  basically , the british government finally agreed to enter dialogue after decades of neglect . 
  maggie thatcher was pm between 1979 and 1990 . 
  she prolonged and exacerbated the conflict when in office . 
  she would not enter talks with the ira , sinn f\u00e9in or the irish government and instead increased military presence and heavy handedness in northern ireland with disastrous results . 
  by the time she left office , the conflict was at an all-time high . 
  the new pm john major came into power and issued the downing street declaration which is one of the first steps of the peace process . 
  it affirmed both the right of the people of ireland to self-determination , and that northern ireland would be transferred to the republic of ireland from the united kingdom only if a majority of its population was in favour of such a move . 
  it was considered sufficient by the provisional ira to announce a ceasefire on 31 august 1994 . 
  however , progress on the peace process stalled several times and the ira ended its ceasefire . 
  on 9 february 1996 , the ira [ detonated a large truck bomb ] ( https://youtu.be/aj1y0ddmzjo?t=92 ) in the london docklands , killing two people , injuring 40 , and causing # 150 million worth of damage . 
  a few months later , on 15 june 1996 , the ira exploded a bomb in manchester , which destroyed a large part of the city centre and injured 212 people . 
  in an ira statement , the ceasefire was ended because `` the british government acted in bad faith with mr major and the unionist leaders squandering this unprecedented opportunity to resolve the conflict '' by refusing to allow sinn f\u00e9in into the talks until the ira decommissioned its arms . 
  irish pm albert reynolds , while not supporting the bombing , concurred with the ira analysis . 
  the bombings put the british government under increased pressure both internally and abroad to fast track the peace process . 
  bill clinton , then president of the united states , visited northern ireland , and spoke in favour of the peace process to a huge rally at belfast 's city hall . 
  between 1996 and 1998 , a lot of progress was made on the peace process . 
  the british government was fully engaged with all sides and busy drawing up the peace agreement . 
  on good friday , 10 april 1998 , the chairman of the peace talks , senator george mitchell , stated : `` i am pleased to announce that the two governments and the political parties in northern ireland have reached agreement '' . 
  it emerged later that president clinton of the usa had made a number of telephone calls to party leaders to encourage them to reach this agreement . 
  the agreement , known as the good friday agreement , included a devolved , inclusive government , prisoner release , troop reductions , targets for paramilitary decommissioning , provisions for polls on irish reunification , and civil rights measures and `` parity of esteem '' for the two communities in northern ireland . 
  the agreement was to be approved by a referendum in northern ireland and the republic of ireland . 
  the result of these referendums was a large majority in both parts of ireland in favour of the agreement . 
  in the republic , 56 % of the electorate voted , with 94 % of the votes in favour of the amendment to the constitution . 
  the turnout in northern ireland was 81 % , with 71 % of the votes in favour of the agreement .

   the norm is for a poster-size portrait of the spanish monarch to preside over public spaces that 's a law ?

   build a 20-foot wall for all i care . 
  [ you 've had plenty of practise . 
   but ca n't see the logic behind directly linking it with british rule or english imperialism or whatnot . 
  the term was brought into the english language during the tudor period by imperialist john dee to express english claim over ireland and surrounding islands . 
  dee also came up with terms like the `` british empire '' and they were crafted solely for political purposes . 
   the geographer and occultist john dee was an adviser to queen elizabeth i of england and prepared maps for several explorers . 
  he helped to develop legal justifications for colonisation by protestant england , breaking the duopoly the pope had granted to the spanish and portuguese empires . 
  dee coined the term `` british empire '' and built his case , in part , on the claim of a `` british ocean '' . 
  he used alleged saxon precedent to claim territorial and trading rights . 
   the lordship of ireland had come under tighter english control as the kingdom of ireland , and diplomatic efforts ( interspersed with warfare ) tried to bring scotland under the english monarch as well . 
  dee used the term `` brytish iles '' in his writings of 1577 , which developed his arguments claiming these territories . 
  regardless of your motives here , i would like to turn this ignorant post into something educational for others . 
  bearing in mind that england and the english are a relatively recent addition to great britain and ireland , let 's have a look at how ireland functioned before the various invasions and conquests by the english . 
   ** common law ** irish law predates england . 
  [ early irish law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_irish_law ) was operational in ireland until the early 17th century when it was banned by the english administration and replaced by english common law . 
  irish law was way ahead of its time in many areas . 
  for example , women had greater freedom , independence and rights to property than in other european societies of the time . 
  men and women held their property separately . 
  divorce was provided for on a number of grounds ( e.g. 
  impotence or homosexuality on the husband 's part ) , after which property was divided according to what contribution each spouse had made to the household . 
   ** schools , universities ** irish schools and colleges predate england . 
  the [ schools and colleges of ireland ] ( http://wicklowinsong.com/wicklow-in-song/history-of-wicklow/irish-monastic-heritage ) were traditionally of two classes , ecclesiastical and lay . 
  the ecclesiastical schools were introduced with christianity and became centres of excellence for peoples from all over europe . 
  irish monk-scholars were a significant and positive force in the cultural development of europe . 
  they spoke and wrote in irish and an uncorrupted latin , and thus served as ideal tutors and interpreters for the new dynasts in europe . 
  the french writer montalembert wrote : `` it has been said and can not be sufficiently repeated , ireland was regarded by all christian europe as the principal centre of knowledge and piety -- superior to anything that could be seen in any other country of europe . '' during the seventh century many anglo-saxon nobles were educated at irish monasteries . 
  the irish willingly welcomed the english students , gave them food , and provided them with books and instruction , without seeking any payment . 
  with the beginning of the english conquests of ireland and the subsequent burning and looting of irish monastic centres , much of the traditional education system was driven underground and eventually formed [ hedge schools ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hedge_school ) . 
  in the 19th century , the british government introduced national schools to ireland , which [ prohibited the teaching of irish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_irish_language#nineteenth_and_twentieth_centuries ) . 
   ** language ** [ irish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_language ) predates english by at least 2,000 years . 
  irish has the [ oldest vernacular literature ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_irish_literature ) in western europe . 
  the irish perfected a technique of making vellum from hides of calves or sheep , allowing them to replicate church psalters . 
  in effect , irish monks became history 's first copying machines . 
  some of the most [ revered manuscripts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/book_of_kells ) in the world were written by irish scholars in both irish and latin . 
  irish only became a minority language in the mid 1800s after repeated attempts by the british government to suppress it . 
  by [ irish independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_war_of_independence ) in 1922 , it was too late to reverse the damage despite the new irish government 's revival efforts . 
  english remains dominant today , but irish still survives along the west coast and is taught in all public schools and [ gaelscoils ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaelscoil ) as a second language . 
   ** architecture ** [ irish architecture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/architecture_of_ireland ) predates england . 
  [ newgrange ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/newgrange ) in ireland was built 5,200 years ago during the neolithic period , making it older than stonehenge and the egyptian pyramids . 
  it is aligned with the rising sun which floods the chamber on the winter solstice . 
  ireland is filled with ancient architecture like this , from dolmens to ring forts , round towers to monasteries and churches . 
   ** football , rugby ** irish sports predate england . 
  [ gaelic football ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaelic_football ) and [ hurling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hurling ) have been played in ireland for 1000s of years and are currently the most popular spectator sports in ireland ( despite being banned by the english with the [ statutes of kilkenny ] ( http://irisharchaeology.ie/2011/09/hurling-its-ancient-history/ ) ) . 
  today soccer and rugby are also popular in ireland , as they are all around the world . 
   ** pubs ** irish pubs predate england . 
  the irish have been brewing their own booze and drinking in pubs long before england existed . 
  of course , when the english did take hold of ireland , they tried to tax the pubs , so they went underground and became * [ s\u00edb\u00edns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shebeen ) *  tea , tv thank you china and scotland !, 
  one step at a time , 
  just a nice pic of a church in ireland and in come the venomous unionists . 
  britain 's poisonous colonial legacy in ireland lives on . 
   are native gaelic speakers . 
  it 's commonly called irish , not gaelic . 
  gaelic refers to a different language in scotland or the entire language family ( goidelic ) , all of which [ decent from old irish ] ( https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/lenguas_goid%c3%a9licas#clasificaci.c3.b3n ) . 
   it 's just madness .
