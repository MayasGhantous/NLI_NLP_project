   profound mismanagement of whom ? 
  as i said in an earlier reply my argument is geographic . 
  the physical island of ireland was profoundly mismanaged while being ruled by the british empire . 
   so , up until 1922 i 'm not a blinkered irish nationalist that falls for the myth of evil britain having her evil way with innocent ireland . 
  the most profound damage done to ireland was done by the irish . 
  also when i say the british empire i 'm not discounting irelands role in supporting and expanding that empire . 
  my point is that the low population density of ireland compared to britain is a clear indicator of profound mismanagement . 
  i do n't think that mismanagement ended with the british empires rule in 1922 . 
  that does n't change the fact that the system of government that was the british empire had a major role in the mismanagement of ireland . 
  if your up for a long read the center for european reform released a report on [ brexit ] ( https://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/pb_grant_may_20feb17.pdf ) . 
  i wrote a summarry in a [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/5v5oaq/mrs_mays_emerging_deal_on_brexit_not_just_hard/de01vh4/ ) in / r/geopolitics . 
  the three main outlooks it takes are a soft exit with free trade agreements between the uk and the eu ( highly unlikely ) a hard exit falling back on wto rules . 
  ( likely ) a harder exit dragging every trade rule through the courts . 
  for example the uk could be expelled from the european free skies agreement . 
  ( possible ) . 
  i found it very convincing and a bit terrifying . 
  true that . 
  the british empire ruled ireland during the famine . 
  arguments can be made that the famine was due to shocks to the food supply or that it was irish landlords that ordered the evicitions . 
  arguments can be made for or against anything . 
  the dramatic disparity in the current population between britain and ireland ca n't be ignored . 
  it is a symptom of profound mismanagement . 
  the fact that the british empire was the instrument of that mismanagement also ca n't be ignored . 
  ireland has undergone a dramatic demographic shift since the 1990s . 
  we currently have a more immigrants ( 15.9 % ) as a percentage of population than the us ( 14.3 % ) . 
  what makes this statistic more profound is that ireland was not a mono culture in the american sense . 
  it was a catholic state with a deep respect for the clergy . 
  only within my lifetime ireland has allowed divorce and the sale of contraception . 
  even today abortion in ireland is highly restricted and if it goes to the courts the fetus gets legal representation as a person . 
  then we had an economic miracle in the 1990s and 2000s . 
  we achieved sustained high levels of growth and attracted more foreign direct investment than india and china combined . 
  the chip that powers your computer was probably made in ireland . 
  in 2004 the eu enlarged . 
  nearly all existing members of the eu put up restrictions on migrations from the new members . 
  ireland , the uk , sweden and cyprus did n't place any restrictions . 
  immigration into ireland from these countries was profound . 
  total immigration into ireland in 2005 was 84,600 , in 2006 it was 107,800 , in 2007 it was 151,100 and in 2008 it was 113,500 . 
  after the crash it returned to a more stable level . 
  this inflow has had a lasting effect on irelands demographics . 
  the top five immigrant groups are poland 122,585 united kingdom 112,259 lithuania 36,683 latvia 20,593 nigeria 17,642 i do n't think i 'm doing justice to the change i 've seen in my lifetime . 
  for example the first black person i saw was in london . 
  now the fifth largest group of immigrants in ireland is nigerian . 
  my back of the envelope calculations show a per capita gdp for the los angeles -- long beach -- santa ana , ca msa of $ 62,184 ( 2014 ) . 
  the imf estimates irelands gdp per capita ( 2015 ) at $ 61,206 . 
  the difference is we are still rapidly growing . 
  la 's growth was 2.25 % in 2014 . 
  ireland is consistently hitting 5 % annually . 
  this economic model with the resulting mass immigration is still very popular . 
  a recent poll showed that 80 % of people favor staying in the eu . 
  the depths of loathing i feel towards neil fergusson are profound . 
  if you want to waste six hours of your life you should watch his [ empire series ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyoxmr08dxa&amp;list=plhzqso983amhalbubnhbhlxerpdhcwdrp ) . 
  his defense of the british empire in this series has left me with a lasting prejudice against him . 
  the systemic atrocities committed by the british empire still scar my country today . 
  it is hard to quantify the lasting damage it caused . 
  i think the best argument is geographic . 
  ireland is roughly a third the size of the uk . 
  if ireland had a population density the same as the uk it 's population be roughly 20 million . 
  the current population is roughly 6 million . 
  i understand that this argument abandons common sense and statistics . 
  i still think it 's valid because that lost population of millions is so damning it is clear evidence of the systemic cruelty and neglect of the british empire . 
  if i ever met neil i 'd probably go full jeremy clarkson and just hit him . 
  with trump as president of the us i 've come to appreciate enda 's profound lack of charisma . 
  when your country is issuing bonds with a [ negative yield ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/13/germany-becomes-second-g7-nation-to-issue-10-year-bond-with-a-negative-yield.html ) maybe it 's time to start spending . 
  i [ commented ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5v8go0/riots_in_rinkeby_warning_shots_fired/de08e1n/ ) elsewhere that it makes economic and humanitarian sense to care for refugees in neighboring countries than foreign countries . 
  i think it was a mistake to abandon the [ dublin iii regulation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_regulation ) that forced refugees to apply in the first eu country they enter . 
  i think it 's a weak argument to blame propaganda . 
  the governments of the nordic countries along with the government of germany made a independent national decision to abandon the dublin regulations . 
  that action and it 's consequences lies with those governments . 
  both of our countries ( ireland / sweden ) placed no restrictions on free movement of labor during the 2004 eu enlargement . 
  i saw the huge benefits and the small costs of accepting hundreds of thousands of immigrants . 
  i know my country is stronger today as a multi cultural society than when we were a mono culture . 
  i think it 's more appropriate to think of the lost decade in terms of the euro countries than the eu . 
  poland for example never went into recession . 
  the more common statistic used to measure personal economic opportunity is gdp per capita . 
  this traditional method is seen as flawed especially within the eu after ireland recorded a gdp growth rate of 26.3 % . 
  this was due to company inversions into ireland and did not reflect economic activity . 
  using wages as a sign of personal economic opportunity is also problamatic as it discounts other forms of income . 
  economists are trying to find a more accurate indicator . 
  changes in adjusted income tax returns looks promising . 
  even by the old method of [ gdp per capita ] ( ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) _ per_capita ) australia still ranks higher than all eu countries except luxembourg , ireland and possibly denmark . 
  edit : formating, 
  but this is the new normal . 
  there are many opportunities when living in a multicultural society . 
  there are also challenges . 
  is it not better to embrace the opportunities and confront the challenges . 
  a more robust attitude in policing will prevent a gang of youths threatening the police . 
  that change does n't seem so great for all the benefits a more diverse society brings .

  hey i 'm irish and i have a weird sort of pride in that we know how to have a proper [ riot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_northern_ireland_riots ) . 
  it produces some amazing photography [ 1 ] ( http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/world/europe/07/12/northern.ireland.riots/t1larg.belfast.riots.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://scd.observers.france24.com/files/images/belfast-riot2.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/68784000/jpg/_68784982_loyalistprotestorblownawaybypsniwatercannon2.jpg ) edit : also our riots are multi cultural . 
  in the 2006 [ dublin riot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_dublin_riots#injuries_and_arrests ) 41 people were arrested and 26 people were charged . 
  23 were irish along with `` one georgian , a romanian and a moldovan '' . 
  i 'd of prefered the finiancial collapse did n't occur but that wo n't change the fact that it happened . 
  their are benefits and costs to becoming an open economy . 
  it 's a matter of opinion but i do n't think a change in policing practices is such a high cost for having an open economy . 
  i 'm guessing your against the refugee policies of germany and the nordic states . 
  i 'm also against them for economic reasons . 
  it [ costs ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2016/sep/13/why-does-resettling-a-refugee-cost-17000-in-the-us-but-85000-in-britain ) alot to settle refugees in europe . 
  in germmany it 's eur 24,800 , the us it 's eur 20,000 , in canada it 's eur 18,900 and in britain it 's expected to be eur 100,300 . 
  the gdp per capita in lebanon is eur 10,600 , in turkey it 's eur 8,726 and jordan it 's eur 3,777 .
