  if we want to help the 6 million refugees outside syria it makes more sense to give them aid in a neighboring country rather than having them run a sick and dangerous race across europe . 
  the fact that nordic countries might have to adopt policing practices closer to irelands is a cost but in my opinion it is low compared to the benefits of having a diverse open economy . 
  100 % agree . 
  i think it also has to be commanded by a general from the baltics . 
  according to the report the 7 brigades would only blunt the russian advance . 
  with a baltic general and a strong doctrine they would not retreat back into central europe . 
  this reminds me of [ great blasket island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_blasket_island ) off the west coast of ireland . 
  it was abandoned in 1956 . 
  it 's probably the bleakest place i 've ever visited . 
  yes . 
  yes it is . 
  did you read the article . 
  the police arrested a man in the subway his mates threw stones the police fired warning shots the arrested mans mates burnt a few cars . 
  have you ever heard of northern ireland . 
  it 's not a place for cowards . 
  this swedish riot is a rough saturday night in derry . 
  i saw we dust off the [ rand ] ( https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/rr1200/rr1253/rand_rr1253.pdf ) corporations plan . 
  it costs about $ 13 billion for the armored brigades and $ 2.3 billion a year to run overall . 
  for that you get 7 brigades trained specifically to defend against the russian army . 
  i think the presence of 30,000 to 40,000 soldiers from the 27 members wearing the [ eu flag ] ( http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/57d10c7add0895a8468b4592-1190-625/brussels-is-moving-closer-towards-creating-an-eu-army-post-brexit.jpg ) would do wonders for integration . 
  if you want a long read about brexit i 'd recommend / u/cuntais _ eile [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/5v5oaq/mrs_mays_emerging_deal_on_brexit_not_just_hard/ ) from the [ centre of european reform ] ( https://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/pb_grant_may_20feb17.pdf ) .

  how did your flair suddenly become american . 
  irelands gdp per capita is $ 68,940 . 
  in 1980 irelands per capita income was 84.4 % of the united states . 
  in 2016 irelands per capita income was 163.2 % of the united states . 
  boo hoo to you if you ca n't seize the opportunities given to you through the simple act of being born in an incredibly rich country . 
  bulgaria ( gdp per capita of $ 6,843 ) is beginning the process of entering the `` liberal globalist '' economy . 
  maybe you 'd like to live there . 
  if your an average employee you 'd have to take an income drop from $ 1,173 to $ 131 a week . 
  you could then enjoy life without the oppression of those `` liberal globalists '' . 
  it depresses me when a see your irish flag flair and then you spout `` globalist liberalism is over '' . 
  forgetting luxembourg our country is the richest citizens in the eu . 
  we have been a leading beneficiary of globalist liberal policies . 
  it boggles my mind that you rage against a system that has provided you and me with great wealth . 
  your right . 
  i missed that the figure was for 2013 . 
  cheers, 
  another user commented that i 'm forgetting about the uks help in bailing out ireland . 
  i know the uk bailed out ireland . 
  it also gave a backdoor bailout of # 14 billion when it injected money into llyods and royal bank of scotland . 
  the uk played a pivotal role in bailing out ireland in 2010 . 
  your house does n't have a gross domestic product . 
  the average house price increased by 8.36 % in the uk last year ( irelands increased by 4.83 % ) . 
  even with this increase credit suisse estimates the the average wealth of a uk adult decreased by $ 33,043 . 
  they account for this wealth decrease because their indicator uses multiple metrics to calculate wealth . 
  it 's going to have to be pronounced kelltic . 
  i 'm not arguing that the uk bailed us out or that we were about to collapse . 
  i had to use a calculator so i 'm going to share . 
  irelands 2008 gdp of $ 274.92 billion fell to $ 221.36 billion in 2010 . 
  that 's a 19.48 % drop . 
  if the uk and others had n't of bailed us out the drop would have probably been higher than your 30 % . 
  the reason i 'm using household wealth as an indicator is because if you measure gdp growth in ireland the traditional way then irelands economy grew by 22 % last year . 
  this absurd figure is the result of inversions . 
  a more accurate figure for economic growth would be the increase in income tax returns . 
  that 's 5.7 % for 2016 . 
  i still think wealth is a better indicator when comparing the uk with any other countries . 
  i think using a wealth indicator shows a truer picture than gdp growth when looking at the effects of brexit . 
  okay but the region will have to be called the new pale . 
  i did n't think you were serious but if you are then hypothetically if ireland needed a bail out it would not turn to the uk . 
  the ecb has funding mechanisms now in place to prevent fluctuations in euro countries government bond markets . 
  they would be the first port of call . 
  after them we 'd turn to the eu and request access to the european financial stability facility . 
  apart from debt as a percentage of gdp ( 120 % ) by nearly all economic indicators the irish economy is performing better than the uk . 
  i doubt we 'll be needing another bailout . 
  if you want we can try and game out the economic implications of a fractured uk with an independent scotland , a reunification of northern ireland and the republic of ireland and a celtic union . 
  we could try and anticipate the reactions of the westminster parliament , the scottish parliament , the northern irish assembly and the irish dail . 
  can you honestly make any sound prediction with so many factors . 
  household wealth is a good indicator of real economic growth . 
  i could quote irelands 26.3 % gdp growth verses the uks 2.2 but that would be just silly . 
  edit : for all the downvotes what indicator would you use . 
  apparently irelands gdp growth last year was 22 % and the uks post brexit gdp growth remained stable at 0.6 % . 
  neither of these figures is factoring in reality . 
  at least a wealth indicator has long term metrics that discount inversions and account for brexit . 
  how else are we going to pay for unification . 
  if the german democratic republic and the federal republic of germany can call themselves germany then i ca n't see much objection on ireland and scotland calling themselves the celtic union . 
  we 'll just write the celtic union in ogham . 
  ` make capital available ' according to [ credit suisse ] ( https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/?fileid=4d81de52-042e-ddb6-4a5c9c2293f46c1c ) the uk lost $ 1,523 billion in household wealth in 2016 . 
  it 's kind of you to offer but i do n't think the uk will be lending anyone money anytime soon . 
  ireland gained 38 billion in household wealth . 
  it 's not ethnic nationalism . 
  it 's just a roundabout way of supporting scottish economic nationalism within the eu . 
  no your wrong option number two is `` the united federation of celts '' . 
  in the eu they 're called structural funds not bailouts . 
  just like west and east germany . 
  it 's time to help our scottish brethren and establish a celtic union ( formerly known as the republic of ireland ) .

  that does n't change the fact that it was n't a 4chan troll .
