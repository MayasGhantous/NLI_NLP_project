like the 80 $ bonus from may , it 's meant as a way to inject money in the economy , starting from the working classes which have been hit the hardest and have therefore cut consumption the most and who are supposed to be the main drivers of recovery : ca n't have companies sell stuff if nobody 's buying ... 
  well , france declared that they want to ignore the budget restrictions , so many people say that it would only be fair for italy to do the same , especially given the pressure that these restrictions impose on the economy . 
  not everyone subscribes to that however , given the state of italy 's debt , and the intention is to only slightly delay compliance with the rules , apparently . 
  ** italy : ** * renzi 's labor leform is taking form , despite opposition and protests from several sides of the parliament . 
  a proposal to introduce tax breaks for companies that hire people for permanent positions while at the same time removing some barriers to terminations was heartily welcomed by the entrepreneurs ' association and strongly condemned by unions . 
  to finance these breaks however renzi is forcing the regions to cut their budgets and this is not making people happy : many student demonstrations took place in several cities , with not entirely peaceful results . 
  another controversial proposal concerns the ( partial ) removal of the ` tfr ' : currently a part of the salary is withheld by employers and only paid out when the employee leaves or is fired , as a form of ` forced ' saving . 
  this has historically allowed companies to have more liquidity , but it 's a pretty anomalous thing ; removing it , however , will cause many companies to go bankrupt according to some analysts . 
  * the debate on same-sex unions is heating up : the mayor of rome registered 16 same-sex couples married abroad in the city 's civil union register with a public ceremony . 
  protesters gathered outside claiming to defend ` traditional families ' while the interior minister alfano and rome 's prefect keep saying that this registration is meaningless and will have to be expunged as it is unlawful . 
  in the meantime the vatican backtracked on its apparent openings towards gay people , while renzi stated that a law on the matter is now a high priority and will follow the labor reform . 
  * in milan the xenophobic lega nord party , together with some post-fascist groups , organized a demonstration against rescue operations in the mediterranean and the lax controls against illegal immigration . 
  * in genoa the discussion about floods rages on : demonstrations against excessive bureucracy , out of control building and corruption have been taking place . 
  it is tricky , and it has been a source of controversy for a while , culminating in an institutional fight just this week . 
  formally there 's no recognition for same sex unions , nor for civil partnerships no matter the involved genders ( i.e. 
  civil unions , or ` light ' marriages ) . 
  some cities decided to start a civil union registry anyway , to allow unmarried couples to register their state . 
  it 's an entirely symbolical thing however . 
  same sex marriages performed abroad can not be formally registered , but some mayors decided to do it anyway and even changed the marriage forms to state ` spouse # 1 ' and ` spouse # 2 ' instead of ` husband ' and ` wife ' , knowing that they are skirting the law . 
  some time ago a gay couple married abroad requested the registration of their wedding , the town refused and they sued . 
  the lawsuit went all the way to the supreme court who stated , in short , that no , you ca n't register same sex marriages because there 's no legal provision , but this is also uncostitutional so a law allowing them must be made . 
  finally , last week the interior minister decided out of the blue to order all the same sex marriage registrations to be expunged from all registries . 
  this triggered a wave of protests , counter protests , fights and refusals from at least some of the involved mayors on the grounds of uncostitutionality . 
  while the details are still being worked over , renzi , the prime minister , declared that a law for same sex civil unions will be ready within november . 
  it wo n't allow full blown marriages , and it will not apply to heterosexual couples , so it will probably be another mess . 
  regarding italy a very recent poll places the support for gay marriage among the general public at about 55 % ( [ source - last table ] ( http://www.demos.it/a01047.php ) ) , with an unexpected increase in support among the centre-right population . 
  there have been a number of attempts in the last 10-15 years to create at least some sort of partnership registration , but they were always abandoned due to some other crisis blowing up the government or due to the heavy opposition from church and right-wing parties . 
  multiple cities have started civil union registries anyway or register marriages from other countries , and even the supreme court ruled that even though same-sex marriages can not be performed without proper legal basis , the lack of such a law is a violation of constitutional principles and should be remedied . 
  just last week the discussion was reignited about the addition of a sexual orientation clause to an anti-discrimination law , which had a number of religious organizations agitated as they want to continue preaching against homosexuality . 
  protests and counter-protests led to some fighting in the streets , but it all served the purpose to once again bring attention on the matter . 
  let 's see what happens once the fighting over the labor reforms and the budget is done ... 
  italy does n't really have a ` bible belt ' , but it does have a sort of ` atheist belt ' which is mostly comprised of tuscany and emilia romagna . 
  southern regions do have a greater number of religion-based festivals with processions and parades , and tends to be more conservative , but there 's no real contiguous block . 
  ** italy : ** * in genoa heavy rains caused floods and widespread damage , killing one person . 
  since this already happened 3 years ago , almost in the same way , people are quite pissed off since a bunch of safety measures ( such as shoring up river banks ) were promised , but nothing happened . 
  it turns out that all the works were indeed scheduled and financed , but were also stuck in a clusterfuck of bureaucracy , lawsuits and tender rules , so nothing was actually done . 
  among protests , volunteers and the poor church cardinal whose house was damaged , the government is promising that this time , definitely , something will be done against too much bureaucracy . 
  * in an effort to encourage job creation the government wants to change labor laws , removing the historical protections that prevented easy employee terminations . 
  this has the unions up to arms , together with the leftmost portions of the government parties . 
  renzi however does n't really want to stall the reforms , so he 's forcing the law through with confidence votes and the support of the right . 
  the left-wing party , whose leader is also renzi , is now facing an internal revolt and strikes are being organized . 
  however since a good deal of youths have no job and therefore do n't really care about termination protections protests might not be large enough this time around . 
  * after another mayor allowed the registration of a same-sex wedding performed abroad the ( right wing ) interior minister issued a directive that required all mayors to cancel any such existing registrations . 
  most mayors that allowed them refused , stating that it would n't be constitutional . 
  in the meantime a catholic-right wing group called ` standing watchers ' organized a demonstration by placing people standing still reading a book in several major squares to protest against the addition of ` sexual orientation ' to an anti-discrimination law , since they want to be free to state that homosexuality is a disease . 
  turnout was low , but it enticed left-wing and lgbt organization to counter-protest and it ended with fights , making the ` standing watchers ' the victims . 
  italy remains the only country in western europe without any law about same-sex unions , since nobody is able to agree upon what kind of law to make . 
  * grillo , leader of m5s ( the fuck every other politician party ) , organized a big meet-up in rome , in which he condemned all newspapers foreseeing their disappearance and demanding that the army act against the government , as it is now a tool of bankers and eurocrats . 
  actually here 's the ( partial ) list of extra taxes on fuel , excluding those post 2000 : * ethiopia war tax ( 1935 ) * suez crisis tax ( 1956 ) * vajont dam emergency tax ( 1963 ) * florence floods emergency tax ( 1966 ) * belice earthquake emergency tax ( 1968 ) * friuli earthquake emergency tax ( 1976 ) * irpinia earthquake emergency tax ( 1980 ) * lebanon crisis funding tax ( 1983 ) * bosnia crisis funding tax ( 1996 ) add about as many instated in recent years for various emergencies/crises/whatever . 
  the peace flag is very similar , but has the word ` pace ' in the middle . 
  the lgbt flag was indeed raised in some places to celebrate specific events . 
  actually , in some cities , you do . 
  not on a church maybe , but in some squares they occasionally show up during ` pride season ' . 
  they were practically unheard of in italy . 
  in the last few years , however , they seem to have become a local feature of some places . 
  together with floods and violent storms . 
  it did seem to be native italian , but with an overstressed pronunciation , like someone who 's attending an acting course and is struggling to properly pronounce every word ... 
  if you only eat in pizzerias you 'll only find pizza ... 
  almost each region in italy has hundreds of typical dishes that are not based on pasta . 
  northern cuisine tends to use more butter than oil , while the central regions are pretty fond of their wild game dishes . 
  if you spent 3 years in italy and only found pasta and pizza you must really hate walking around . 
  you do n't even need to go into a fancy restaurant , just enter a random trattoria and have a go . 
  ** italy ** * a she-bear named daniza that injured a man was the object of a extended capture campaign . 
  the bear was originally used to repopulate bears in italy , but lately it had begun getting to close to towns and killing sheep . 
  the bear was captured and sedated , but an adverse reaction to the anesthetic killed her , leaving two orphan cubs . 
  all hell broke loose , as every single politician , mayor , secretary , singer , hipster or hobo needed to denounce the horrible cruelty that was perpetrated upon the innocent bear due to the ruthless and merciless action of the trento province administration . 
  conspiracy theories that could rival the ones on 9/11 have begun to surface , detailing the twisted plots that managed to deliver the lethal injection to the poor bear , while at least 20 ranks of various kinds of officers are expected to commit ritual suicide or be paraded in rags to atone for their mistakes . 
  * luca cordero di montezemolo , ceo of ferrari for over 20 years , was fired by the fiat-chrysler board , who control ferrari . 
  now the ceo will be marchionne , who also leads fiat and intends to make sure that ferrari goes back to winning f1 races . 
  following the move of several fiat administration offices to the us after the chrysler merge people wonder if such a thing will also happen to ferrari , but marchionne strongly denied such an event . 
  no comments were released regarding the brutal murder of daniza . 
  * the economy still sucks and jobs still do n't increase , but it will happen any time now -- the necessary reforms must however be delayed by the parlamentary inquries regarding the cruel daniza murder . 
  * three missionary nuns were murdered in burundi for unknown reasons , perhaps due to the ongoing religious strife . 
  local authorities also say that the nuns were also raped , but this does not seem to be confirmed by the other missionaries . 
  this is another matter , i was discussing the validity of the padania idea itself . 
  a local referendum about secession is not something that is allowed by the current laws , as far as i know - a referendum can be requested by the people to strike down a law or by the government to consult the people on some matter , while the constitution could be interpreted as being against attempts at secession . 
  anyway even allowing that some loophole could be found by a regional council to organize such a referendum , there is no region where a party with the goal of independence has a significant consensus . 
  i think that lega nord was under 10 % of the votes in all regions at the last elections , so it does not seem to be an issue with a significant following . 
  again , there 's no specific kinship . 
  it 's the lega nord that keeps trying to beat the idea into people , sometimes calling upon ancient ` celtic heritage ' by doing fake druid stuff on the po river , then turning around to appeal to ` fundamental christian values ' . 
  if you want to look for more specific identities you can just trace the borders of the existing regions and you 'll find them readily divided . 
  it would have much more sense to split veneto off to one side and piedmont to another , but there 's no reason to bundle them together into an arbitrary group that happens to match the places in which lega nord got more than 4 % of the votes . 
  they needed some cause to ride to the elections and invented a flag for that purpose , trying to convince people that it was always there . 
  because it is a custom-made area that conveniently happens to encompass a good deal of the most high-production areas of italy . 
  there 's no other common bond , not even some sort of vague ancestral blood bond to some ancient people . 
  there 's different dialects and different cultures involved . 
  yeah , italy was also made up , just like any other country - it 's time that creates the identity . 
  but padania has had even less time on the stage than italy . 
  so far the only thing they have done is look like clowns . 
  their main backing parties are notorious for being full of idiots and crazy people , pulling stunts like chasing muslim-looking people away with pig blood , spraying disinfectant at black people or , more recently , saying that north korea is a nice country after all , very orderly and unfairly victim of prejudice . 
  what is freedom of the press after all ? 
  ** italy : ** * a teenager boy , riding a scooter with 2 other people , refused to stop at a checkpoint in naples and tried to speed away . 
  the policemen chased , he fell and somehow a shot was fired killing him . 
  the 2 other people had criminal precedents , but the victim did not . 
  a number of people in naples are staging protests against police brutality , while the policeman 's defence is that he stumbled and fired by accident . 
  * as part of cost saving measures , renzi has continued a salary freeze for state workers . 
  it is now several years that the salaries have been frozen and people are getting angry , including policemen , who also lack training and resources , and therefore will be organizing strikes soon . 
  * a ban on artificial insemination with donor sperm was ruled inconstitutional in june , dismantling a controversial law from berlusconi 's era that forced couples to go abroad for the procedure . 
  now regional councils have issued basic rules to perform the procedure and a large number of hospitals are getting ready , despite the lack of a proper national law . 
  conservative politicians and church figureheads are having their jimmies rustled .
