  tuition fees are generally much lower than in the us , and you can get reductions based on results and income ( not sure they apply for foreigners though ) . 
  while education is generally good , at least in some universities , the economic situation does not give that many opportunities for jobs afterwards , at least right now , especially if you hope for a decent salary . 
  you might however get a degree , see how the situation is in a few years , then decide to move elsewhere if you find nothing interesting . 
  italy can be very warm during summer however , even in the north . 
  if you like colder climates look to germany and beyond . 
  well , a lot of families in italy are actually home owners , so parents would often take mortgages for an investment home that they would rent out to pay the mortgage . 
  once a child needed it the house would go to him , so he could repeat the mortgage/rent thing italy never had the housing bubble that messed up the usa and many other countries . 
  the mechanism broke with the economic crisi in the last few years , with salaries becoming insufficient to pay mortgages and rents , but still there 's no widespread defaulting on mortgages . 
  the main problem right now is companies not getting credit and closing down , or firing people . 
  in italy dialects are still used , but only among friends and family . 
  they are declining , as someone who only spoke dialect was seen as uneducated , so schools and families often discouraged speaking them . 
  nowadays there are beginning to be seen as cultural heritage , so some people are thinking about reviving them as optional school subjects . 
  i 'm talking about european highways . 
  when i was in america i was told that the goal was getting there as fast as possible , and fuck the hills who try to prevent that . 
  highways often follow older roads , or were built when there were n't high powered vehicles . 
  this means that too steep inclines would have been too hard to build or follow , and as a result they tried to avoid going straight over a hill . 
  at least , that 's how i heard it explained ... 
  italy : who attends university outside of his town will move out and rent an apartment , usually shared with other people ; same goes if you find a job in another town . 
  otherwise usually people stay home until they marry or earn enough to afford a home . 
  it 's very rare for someone to rent if it 's not needed . 
  it also used to be common that parents would save some money to buy an apartment and rent it out until it was needed by a child . 
  buying a house for your children was often the norm before the crisis . 
  nowadays this is very hard , so people are living with their parents longer and longer . 
  there are even married couples that ca n't afford their house , so they live with one of the families until they can afford something else . 
  it 's a bit complex , but here 's a super short summary . 
  until 1994 there was a big ` center ' party that won pretty much every time , especially in opposition to the left wing parties , who were seen as dangerously close to the communists . 
  then a big corruption scandal happens , and the party blows up . 
  berlusconi , a successful media entrepreneur , appears and states that he 's going to build a modern alternative to the ` old politics ' and starts to gather the center-right parties around him , waving the terrible danger of the ` communist left ' as the inevitable alternative . 
  he wins . 
  he starts messing up the laws in his favor ( he owns the largest media conglomerate in italy , including the 3 main private channels ) . 
  as head of parliament , he basically controls the 3 public tv channels , leading to a massive conflict of interests that is , however , ignored . 
  with massive 6-channel propaganda , targeted law reforms for big companies ( false accounting ? 
  that should n't be a crime !, 
  ) , promises of tax cuts and endless jobs and as only bulwark against the commies ( a constant danger ) he keeps being elected . 
  along the way he also picks up post-fascists , the northern league separatists who are looking for a spot in parliament and provide a bunch of votes in the north , and - allegedly - mafia contributions who , after all , seem to like him a lot . 
  now that most of his promises , after almost 20 years , have turned out to be only to his advantage many people are waking up from the spell . 
  many people are radically averse to the left wing , however , so they just abstained in the last local elections . 
  what will happen next year is still up in the air . 
  he managed to nullify or invalidate most of his trials , by declaring the deeds lawful or by making laws that provided suitable loopholes . 
  he still has a few ongoing trials , with a couple more in the making for his brother and son , and the parliament right now is much more hostile to him , since he resigned from prime minister . 
  his party has lost lots of approval , as proven by the last few mayoral elections in which it lost basically everywhere , and his allies are quickly trying to put together alternative parties , as his legacy is somewhat toxic . 
  unless he manages to devise some incredible propaganda and find enough allies for the next political elections next year , it might be possible to see him without a political shield , if not with an actively hostile government that might undo most of his crazy laws . 
  that said most of his trials will expire soon for limitations , so it will be very unlikely to see him in jail . 
  and he 'd probably run elsewhere instead like his ` teacher ' , craxi . 
  yeah , although it seems they really are trying hard to get some jail time now . 
  maybe we 'll get rid of at least some of them ... 
  i wonder that too . 
  it may have to do with the fact that in italy there are no limits to how long you stay in charge , and staying in power for a long time leads to a system prone to corruption . 
  or maybe it 's due to a culture in which family ties are deemed much more important than anything else , so you are somehow expected to provide for your relatives in any possible way , whatever the laws are . 
  in italy right now most politicians are quite old - a recent report stated that they are the oldest in europe - and they are quite set in their ways . 
  older people are generally more averse to changes , and new people have a hard time getting into the system , since electoral laws are made by the current parliament . 
  we have a system that tries to protect itself and during elections you have to choose one of the ` big ' parties or risk having your vote wasted . 
  the latest mayoral elections saw however a surprising success for the anti-system parties and this is throwing the established parties into chaos . 
  berlusconi 's party almost disappeared from most cities , lots of people did n't vote and the ` not-party ' founded by a stand-up comedian whose motto is ` fuck them all ' managed to win in a medium sized city . 
  it might be that the next political elections will have a few surprises ... 
  i 'm italian , and the monti government has sharply raised taxes in the last year in order to lessen the deficit and steer the finances towards something sensible . 
  i 'm not opposed , in principle , to high taxes , as long as they serve a good purpose and are levied fairly . 
  we have however a few problems with that . 
  employees are taxed directly from their wages , so they pay them fully . 
  many other people instead have various ways to dodge them , by avoiding invoices , paying under the table and generally reporting much lower incomes than what 's true , taking advantage of many loopholes and ` special ' laws that always seem to be there when needed . 
  this means that richer people actually end up paying less taxes and get to use the services intended for poorer people , like school taxes exemptions or low-rent housing . 
  for example you get a tax discount on a property as long as it is your main residence . 
  people with several properties can just state that each family member has a different main residence , so they get all the discounts , then they rent them out off the books , paying no taxes on the rent . 
  this kind of stuff was , at least until now , seen as normal : everybody does it , so you 're a sucker if you do n't . 
  i 'll give you a discount on the rent , you keep quiet and everybody 's happy , and we both have cheated the state who wants to rob us . 
  there are signs that this kind of behavior is becoming less accepted and i hope that this crisis will be a wake up call for everyone . 
  if the general mindset does n't change we 'll never be able to fix our economy . 
  heh , since we got monti in italy raising taxes and threatening to raise rates on the rich switzerland has been running out of safe deposit boxes . 
  i 've heard banks are renting them from hotels , given the wave of people from italy who are opening accounts and stashing stuff in there . 
  to be fair , this university is one of the leading schools in technical subjects ( engineering , computer science , etc. ), 
  where a working english language skill is often required and opens up a lot more opportunities . 
  you would n't see a law school switching to english ... 
  i guess that what 's you get when the political geniuses who just got smacked by the elections blame taxes instead of themselves for what they have done in the past 20 years ... 
  a couple for italian : * ** fare bella figura ** means roughly to perform well , but with a strong emphasis on appearance . 
  it 's one of the main points of the berlusconi way : the facade must be pretty , the rest will be a matter for later . 
  * ** dietrologia ** ( lit . 
  ` what 's behind-ology ' ) is the discussion of what the real motives are regarding a public personality or decision . 
  in italy nobody will ever ask you for id in a bar or store . 
  i do n't think anybody knows whether there is a minimum drinking age . 
  strangely enough it 's fairly rare to see drunk people around . 
  haha , i start laughing just thinking about how that man sings ... 
  in italy we have had a similar phenomenon with lega nord , which is not exactly extreme right wing , but shares a lot of traits with this kind of party . 
  they wanted less immigration , more police , less taxes and more economical and political independence of the richer northern italy ( one of their main slogans was ` rome is a thief ' , referring to tax money being mostly spent in the poorer southern regions ) . 
  they opposed berlusconi at first due to the alleged mafia relations ( and that is a southern thing , right ? 
  ) , only to completely change opinion once they could use him to get into the parliament . 
  they managed to gather a significant consensus ( they had over 14 % at some point i think ) using the usual cards of ` they 're taking our jobs/stealing our stuff ' and calling for secession of the north . 
  this consensus came mainly from people in the richer , more industrialized zones who started seeing companies going bankrupt , jobs being lost to cheap immigrant laborers or outsourced to other countries and generally less money coming their way . 
  they invented a mythology about their ancient homeland and people ( a non-existent padania inhabited by celtic descendants , distinct from other italians ) and used that to rally a lot of ` naive ' people as a start , then gathered more exploiting discontent and fear of change with harsh , direct language ( `` we 'll ram our hard manhood in their butts '' ) and threats of radical action against the other corrupt parties . 
  unfortunately this works a lot on the less educated segments of the population , and more educated people are happy to tag along once they see their interests being addressed , no matter the way . 
  happy ending ( maybe ? 
  ) : now they 're exploding after several illicit affairs have been discovered , involving the mafia , kickbacks , corruption and their precious northern money being exported to tanzania investments , of all things ... 
  berlusconi , since leaving his position of prime minister , has kept a really low profile . 
  before he was constantly on tv , now he 's almost disappeared . 
  his party has plummeted in the polls and his allies of the lega are also sinking in a swamp of scandals and resignations . 
  that said i would n't declare him out of the game . 
  he can still hold this government hostage with the number of his people in the parliament , but after the elections things might change a lot and all his custom-made laws might be repealed . 
  i doubt he 'd accept that without fighting ... 
  it 's more about corruption and nepotism . 
  unfortunately it tends to be true , at least in some cases : the sicilian regional government , for example , has many more employees per inhabitant than any other region , with no matching increase in usefulness . 
  and southern universities and hospitals have a suspiciously high frequency of the same surnames among the people in important positions .
