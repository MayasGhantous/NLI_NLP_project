  * one of the two navy members detained in india since 2012 had to be hospitalized for health issues , triggering a burts of protests about the fact that nothing is being done to resolve the situation . 
  india continues to delay their trial and italy keeps doing nothing , allegedly because of commercial interests with india . 
  * bad weather this summer has heavily influenced tourism , especially on coastal regions , negating the economic reprieve that many people were waiting for . 
  interested parties are calling for urgent measures to reduce the cost of doing business and to increase the marketing efforts . 
  as far as i know it 's not italian engineering that has a bad name , but italian management/organization , even in italy . 
  a common opinion during the nuclear choice referendum was `` nuclear plants in italy ? 
  yeah right , and then we 'll get mysteriously radioactive roads and tomatoes after nuclear waste mysteriously vanishes '' or stuff like that . 
  in 1987 a referendum was called to decide whether italy would rely on nuclear power . 
  the response was a strong no . 
  italy did have several nuclear plants , but they were all dismantled following that result . 
  a few years ago berlusconi tried to bring nuclear energy back , even starting an agreement with sarkozy , but another referendum put a stop to that . 
  some people use a spoon to help rolling spaghetti around a fork ... 
  yes , strictly connected with breakfast . 
  well , no italian would usually do that as a cappuccino is considered breakfast stuff . 
  ordering a cappuccino late , or after a meal , is just something typically foreign , but nobody would actually do anything but smirk at you , and most bartenders in touristy places expect it anyway . 
  eat spaghetti with a spoon and people will point at you , however , especially kids . 
  ** italy : ** * the costa concordia completed its last voyage , having being towed from the giglio island to genoa where it will be dismantled . 
  genoa was selected after harsh competition between several harbors , all wanting to take home the substantial payout for the job . 
  this was of course a good occasion for a photo op , with politicians patting themselves on the back for the ` mission accomplished ' party , and apparently also a form of rebuttal to france , who was expecting the concordia to fall apart and pour crap all over the sea . 
  [ huffpo ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2014/07/27/costa-concordia-genova_n_5624266.html?utm_hp_ref=italy ) * since it 's somehow ` haha france take this ' day , for some reason , the tour de france was won by an italian . 
  this was mysteriously connected with the concordia not falling apart . 
  [ huffpo ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2014/07/27/vincenzo-nibali-vince-tour-de-france_n_5624549.html?utm_hp_ref=italy ) * berlusconi 's appeal trial for the case of underage prostitution exploitation and related stuff ended with his acquittal . 
  apparently ruby really was mubarak 's niece , and ` bunga bunga ' really meant ` sophisticated conversation ' .

  well , lots of people do n't like that , so they registered something like 8000 amendments for discussion in the attempt to foil this evil plan , mostly similar to `` paragraph 2 , line 3 : add one space '' . 
  renzi is threatening to use the special secret power of amendment mass destruction to do away with all this . 
  cue the `` aaah dictatorship '' cries , even though such a law will still have to pass a referendum , being a change to the constitution .

  in italian it 's `` ridere sotto i baffi '' , or `` laugh under your moustache '' , with the exact same meaning . 
  also , it does n't contribute to the final grade , unless you get reported for bad behavior . 
  as i said the main goal is kicking out older politicians , who in their view are responsible for everything bad that has happened . 
  i guess everything will sort itself out afterwards . 
  agree . 
  they refuse the designation themselves , saying that traditional definitions are meaningless and their main job is getting all the ` old ' politicians out . 
  they do have mostly anti-establishment ideas and do not shy away from contacting right-wing extremists if needed . 
  voting pd was seen as the anti-grillo vote , given how directly grillo challenged renzi . 
  lots of people actually said `` i do n't really like renzi , but grillo must not win , so pd it is ! '', 
  because what he says is little more than `` tax the rich , kick politicians out , money for everyone else and fuck the euro '' . 
  which seems to be somewhat vague and/or dangerous as a political platform . 
  mostly unemployed people , young people and also a great deal of fringe groups , like anarchists or post-fascists . 
  most polls give fi ( i.e. 
  berlusconi ) no more than 18-20 % of the vote . 
  the real fight is between pd ( moderate left ) and m5s ( grillo , a.k.a. 
  fuck europe and everyone else ) both hovering around 30 % with a slight advantage to pd . 
  it must be said that these elections were n't about europe at all , but rather a sort of confidence vote for the current parties . 
  since renzi became prime minister rather unorthodoxically everyone wants to see what the people think , with m5s hoping to gain some sort of motivation to demand that the government resign . 
  there 's several if you really consider them all , starting with prepositions ( per , con , dal , erc ... ) . 
  colomba is the ` commercialized ' easter dessert you can find all over italy . 
  however almost all regions have their own foods , the most famous of which is probably the [ neapolitan pastiera ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pastiera ) . 
  i do n't know if it 's just a product of the last couple of decades , but there 's several factors in play i think . 
  first of all , after the troublesome years of student protests ( end of the '60s ) an entire generation of teachers was made with no real skills or knowledge . 
  i 've experienced myself several 68ers , as they 're often called , pretending being teachers . 
  that , and the 20 years of belittling and dismantling of the education system begun with berlusconi 's age of tv success , led to several generations of people who really do n't value culture or knowledge . 
  several ` older ' people are baffled at how ignorant younger people are , or even at how even basic texts turn out to be challenging to lots of people under 30 . 
  culture is not cool , taking part in x-factor is . 
  books ? 
  boring , and facebook takes enough time already . 
  add to this the economic crisis , due to which entire branches of knowledge are now considered pretty much useless ( literature , philosophy , history , etc. ), 
  and there you have it . 
  people just think studying is worthless , you wo n't get a job anyway , so you might as well spend time doing auditions for big brother or whatever . 
  i 'm sure the reasons are much more complex than these , but this is just my opinion . 
  by international law you must rescue people from the sea . 
  once rescued you find out they have no documents and wo n't tell you where they come from . 
  this means that you can not send them back , as you do n't know where their nationality , and their country will refuse them anyway . 
  or , if their country is dangerous , they 'll ask for asylum and then by international law you must accept the request . 
  checkmate . 
  so what happens ? 
  in italy they get put into ` rescue camps ' for first aid and medical assistance , and unavoidably they run away sooner or later . 
  it is one of the stunts renzi is using to project the ` young , modern revolutionaire ' brand . 
  executive cars are traditionally associated with corruption and waste in italy : symbols of status and power , get one and parade around town with it , maybe with a police escort , to show who 's boss . 
  there are crazy numbers of such cars at all levels of politics . 
  in fact several politicians have made a point of publicly giving up their car to show that they were different . 
  renzi went one step further and organized this stunt as a way to show that he 's really starting to dismantle the corrupted system in a way that attracts attention . 
  of course there are many more that remain ... 
  ** italy ** - just a short summary . 
  * renzi has visited both hollande and merkel , presenting his reform plan and demands for a more fair and less binding set of rules . 
  apparently his plan was well received . 
  * renzi stated that he wants to cut public offices/services managers wages and pensions , since they 're absurdl high . 
  the railway company manager stated that if he gets a pay cut ( currently 800.000 $ + ) he might be forced to move abroad . 
  people are of course really desperate and sympathetic with the poor guy . 
  * berlusconi 's final verdict definitely , no exceptions valid , bans him from public charges . 
  no european parliament seat for him , and his party is really bummed about that , especially since they would lose the name in the lists . 
  hey , but did n't berluconi have a few children ? 
  hmmm ... 
  yes he is , and yes he does . 
  his army of minions is actually trying to convince people that preventing berlusconi from running in the elections is a dire wound to the heart of democracy , that a person who gets so many votes ** can not ** be banned , the laws be damned . 
  it 's all a plot of the evil judges who wanted to defeat an unbeatable political adversary by means of corrupt justice , and this can not be accepted . 
  i guess they want to see what happens if he actually registers as a candidate and is then rejected . 
  ** italy ** a quick recap : a short while ago we had a quick government changeover as renzi , the left wing mayor of florence who has been trying to become prime minister candidate for a while started a party rebellion which pulled the rug under letta , who acted as prime minister for just a few months , and stole the crown . 
  basically the parliament is still mostly split 3 ways , but renzi built some bridges towards berlusconi in order to secure some support and had himself voted by the parliament as new pm .
