  some people call renzi `` the berlusconi of the left '' , some other `` the buffoon salesman '' and some other see in him the true chance for something to actually happen . 
  so , this week : * renzi primises a chainfire of reforms , almost one a month , to fix jobs , the economy and schools . 
  as a first step within 2 months the automatic taxes on salaries will be reduced for mid/low earners by about $ 1000/year . 
  where the money is supposed to come from is still unclear . 
  * renzi has started the europe tour by visiting hollande in france , apparently finding some common ground in trying to get europe ( read germany ) to change the tune on austerity . 
  on monday he 'll go tell the tale to frau merkel . 
  * the newly minted defence minister is considering cutting the notorious f35 orders , and maybe closing down a few hundred military installations . 
  * berlusconi , despite having been convicted and banned from offices , is considering not giving a fuck and candidating himself for the european elections , since it would be undemocratic to keep a beloved leader from his electors . 
  he 'll probably try forcing the issue to play the martyr part . 
  * beppe grillo , the ` inspirator ' of m5s , the `` fuck all politicians '' party of web-democracy that got almost 25 % of the votes , keeps kicking out all the elected mps that even vaguely hint at not agreeing with him . 
  the kicked out people are now basically free for the picking by other parties , while grillo himself is now looking for allies in the xenophobic and secessionistic lega nord , who also would like to ditch the euro , to gain momentum for the european elections . 
  * one of the ` nice girls ' of berlusconi 's entourage was caught at the airport coming from venezuela with 24kg of cocaine in her suitcase , when she somehow skipped the security check . 
  * pot is now legal in medical therapies . 
  it varies from region to region . 
  in some places the big celebration is lunch on the 25th , in others dinner on the 24th . 
  formally renzi comes from the left wing , but he has often sought ways to approach the right side of the parliament . 
  he has been invited by berlusconi a couple of times for talks , and berlusconi expressed a slight appreciation for him . 
  and being appreciated by berlusconi is a dubious achievement ... 
  there 's 3 degrees of appeal in italy , and an appeal can be requested by the prosecution too . 
  the 2nd degree is basically a do-over , while the 3rd degree can only decide on whether proper procedures and limitations were followed . 
  there 's an interesting documentary about the italian situation made by a gay couple , a few years ago . 
  it 's called `` improvvisamente l'inverno scorso '' , if anyone is interested . 
  basically the left wing parties periodically try to have at least some sort of civil union passed , and every time all hell breaks loose and the government collapses . 
  again just this week the new leader of the main left wing party stated that they will pass civil unions , and immediately the berlusconi-controlled party threatened a government collapse ... 
  i 'm not sure if it 's a regional thing , but most people know them , even if not many like them . 
  they 're not so uncommon in italy . 
  you can usually buy them at village fairs from street vendors ... 
  ** italy : ** * berlusconi still needs to be voted out of the parliament after his conviction for tax fraud . 
  since all other parties are afraid of traitors in their midst , or that other parties will blame them if berlusconi gets saved , a whole espionage/diplomacy game has been played resulting in a change of rules so that the vote will be public , instead of secret as it 's usual . 
  berlusconi got really pissed off at this ( maybe he did find some traitors ) and he 's trying another round of government blackmail . 
  as for * when * the vote will happen , it 's still undecided . 
  * the government revealed details of the next budget law . 
  the long expected tax cuts will finally arrive !, 
  ... a whopping 14 $ / month on average . 
  so everyone is now firing on the government saying they suck . 
  and the government is trying to pull out some more money for more tax cuts . 
  * a gay guy jumped from a building leaving a letter in which he said he could n't stand being insulted any longer . 
  let 's talk some more about the chance of maybe doing something about that . 
  * it 's november , and people still go to the beach . 
  but maybe the cold is finally arriving ... 
  it generally happens because of the vicious cycle law -  loophole -  law to counter the loophole . 
  instead of radically rewriting the whole thing sensibly all governments just push stopgap measures that accumulate into a complex tangle of procedures . 
  and that 's because radical measures touch too many interests and meet all sorts of oppositions . 
  just an example : you need a ` rightful reason ' to fire someone . 
  so shady employers make you sign a blank ` voluntary ' resignation letter they can use later on . 
  so a law gets passed that requires you to obtain a specific resignation form from a specific office if you want to quit . 
  then shady employers only hire you for 3-months spans , re-hiring you if needed . 
  then a law passes that forbids temporary contracts back-to-back . 
  now shady employers hire you for 3 months and then wait 1 month before rehiring , so people work off-and-on . 
  and so it goes on and you end up with crazy procedures to hire and fire people , so much that at some point even honest employers prefer to skip the whole tirade and hire you under the table anyway . 
  in italy tuition is roughly $ 2000/year , depending on the university . 
  however that can be reduced a lot with low income and good results , down to the point that it 's almost free . 
  non-eu citizens also have some extra advantages , in limited numbers , as far as i know . 
  it 's meant to help people from poorer countries , but i 'm not sure on the restrictions . 
  that said the only universities that hold courses fully in english , i think , are the turin and milan technical schools ( politecnico ) , that offer various engineering and science courses . 
  you know , it 's not a matter of authorization or permissions . 
  the fact is that a barge full of people turns up in your sea and you are ** required ** to help them , by many treaties and laws . 
  this means that you have to take them to an hospital and give them aid . 
  then ? 
  what do you do ? 
  in theory you should send them back to their country , but how do you do that ? 
  their country is either in a state of war or will arrest and punish them , so you are ethically prevented from doing that . 
  so now you have hundred of possibly sick and poor people who do n't speak the language , have likely no education and no means of surviving by themselves . 
  what happens now ? 
  there 's of course the proposed solution of our nice xenophobic party : fire on their boats and sink them . 
  cute , is n't it ? 
  ok , maybe you have a large profitable company and all the tax cuts he promises do your interest . 
  but do you really believe that they would be sustainable ? 
  that it is n't just a propaganda stunt and it wo n't backfire in a few years when the debt increases even more ? 
  do you feel that all the laws he forced through to protect himself really do anyone else a favor ? 
  his voters have showed themselves to be highly resistant to reason and common sense . 
  some are brainwashed by his tv channels and some of the state channels . 
  news and talk shows on those channels always spin the news painting him as the poor victim of a corrupt system . 
  some appreciate the fact that he basically supports tax evasion , as he never did much to fight it ( and benefitted greatly from it ) . 
  some people do n't care for much beyond ` lower taxes ! ', 
  no matter what happens to the state budget . 
  and some people just hate anyone who 's left wing , so they vote for ` anything but left ' . 
  some just like the ` favors ' they get if they support him . 
  add the crazy right-wing fanatics who vote for the rightmost thing they can find and there you have it . 
  let 's be precise please !, 
  he got about 10 million votes out of a total 50 million voters ... 
  so 1 out of 5 . 
  still disheartening , but not that much !, 
  yeah , every time he does something it 's a stab in the heart to every decent person in this country . 
  the blatant disregard for rules , laws and ethics showed by him and all of his lackeys is unbelievable . 
  this latest stunt is probably his final attempt to blackmail everyone : either he gets a literal get-our-of-jail-free card or he throws everything out of the window . 
  i can not understand how people keep supporting him . 
  oh how it stings to think how much better could this country be if it was n't run by thieves and scammers ... 
  one of the reasons is that many see the left as the party of moochers and lazy people : `` you want to tax my work to pay for social support and gypsies ? 
  go die in a fire !, 
  berlusconi save us ! '' . 
  berlusconi has always endorsed the idea of lowering taxes on property and assets , which greatly benefits rich people , even going so far as to say that some tax fraud is n't that bad . 
  in a country where tax dodging is a very popular sport that 's bound to get you some support , especially from the dentist with the big villa or the construction entrepreneur that pays his workers off the books . 
  his line is `` the left is irresponsible . 
  they jeopardize the entire country by insisting on this act of revenge against me , which will force our party to withdraw support from the government , since such a conduct is intolerable '' . 
  the ` act of revenge ' is a mostly pro-forma vote of unsuitability for office , enacted when some mp is sentenced . 
  the left party could theoretically vote against , but that would mean losing all credibility since they always asserted that law must be the same for everyone . 
  ** italy ** * berlusconi , of course . 
  all attempts to find a loophole or political help against his sentence seem to be failing , so his party is threatening to collapse the government in retaliation . 
  the left party , having found some shred of dignity , announced `` we ca n't compromise law for blackmails .
