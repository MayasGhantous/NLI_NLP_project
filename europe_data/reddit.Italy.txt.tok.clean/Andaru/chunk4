  if the government falls , everyone will know whose fault it is '' . 
  and in the meantime everyone prepares for new elections - still with the same crappy rules that everyone wants to change but nobody actually manages to do . 
  his voters embrace the party line : he 's the victim of a judicial plot organized by his enemies . 
  how could he otherwise have been indicted so many times ? 
  hopefully yes , but not very soon . 
  among the damages berlusconi did was the total devaluing of culture and education . 
  lots of school funding cuts and the brainwashing with distorted models ( success = winning big brother !, 
  apply now !, 
  or maybe be extra nice to the casting director ... ) made it so that lots of people want quick returns , not long term planning . 
  so saying `` let 's cut all taxes ! '', 
  sounds much better than `` let 's carefully lower spending '' . 
  the way out requires rebuilding the cultural level of people , beginning with schools and universities . 
  only then people will be able to select valid leaders . 
  in my opinion , of course . 
  i have a theory that we keep electing berlusconi so we ca n't possibly run out of jokes about ourselves ... 
  ** italy : ** * the stock exchange index rises , the bond spread lowers , exports increase . 
  might the economy be on the rise ? 
  * berlusconi ongoing drama . 
  now he rented planes to fly over beaches with banners supporting himself . 
  his party is remote-controlled and is ready to ditch the government at his command . 
  everyone else is `` wtf ? 
  go in jail already ! '', 
  but maybe not , let 's talk about it some more . 
  * a gay teen committed suicide leaving a letter about being bullied in school . 
  time to get that anti-discrimination law done ? 
  well , let 's not be hasty , we waited 10 years , we can wait some more . 
  * several women killed by their boyfriends/husbands . 
  time to increase punishment for stalking and harassing to prevent their escalation ? 
  why do n't we discuss about that sometime later ? 
  * refugee boats keep coming . 
  what to do ? 
  well , we can discuss about it some more first . 
  and there are never enough occasions for the nothern league guys to display racism and exploit it for propaganda after all . 
  i wish . 
  he 's already prepping his daughter to take his place if he can not dodge the public office ban . 
  and the whole right-wing party knows they 'll vanish without him , so they 're going way beyond decency to support him . 
  thanks !, 
  native italian in italy , in my case . 
  last time the tax agency held a selection thousands of people applied for each region in which there were vacancies . 
  people even applied for regions over 500km away , as they reasoned that a region with more spots would give them more chances than a closer region with fewer spots . 
  it 's not like people are lazy . 
  any job offer is like blood for sharks ... 
  *** italy : *** our favorite showman , berlusconi , was convicted for tax fraud in the last degree of appeal . 
  so now he can not leave the country , will have to go into house arrest and he should not be able to participate in any election for a few years ( barring any loophole his lawyers are surely looking for ) . 
  of course all shit broke loose . 
  his party is spouting nonsense 24/7 now : the democracy has been killed , millions of people have no leader due to a judicial coup , the president must pardon him or civil war will ensue and `` silvio 's army '' is alreading mobilizing . 
  they keep threatening to resign en masse , to collapse the government and all sorts of terrible things . 
  the left parties however , now that the unconfortable alliance with the right has become even more unconfortable , are in crisis trying to decide what 's worse : stay allied with a criminal and a party of crazed remote-controlled madmen or give it up and spin the roulette to see where the ball lands . 
  oh and one of the most iconic streets of rome is now interdicted to traffic . 
  it 's all part of the media brainwashing that he constantly puts up . 
  he always played the role of the victim , targeted by magistrates and communists that could only resort to judicial attacks since his unwavering public support shows how the people love him . 
  it 's so effective that even now his whole party is threatening to withdraw from the parliament to protest this ` abuse ' that ` left millions of voters without their chosen representative ' . 
  as if the fact that he got votes somehow made his being a criminal irrelevant . 
  commonly ? 
  by a certain segment of people , maybe . 
  and anyway , ' i do that because everyone does it ' is another unfortunate italian habit . 
  you know , the entirety of his party is throwing massive tantrums about the 7 years sentence and how that means that the justice system is a joke - all without a shred of shame . 
  showing up just to get the daily stipend is pretty much a saintly conduct for them . 
  not precisely , but there 's a number of telltale gestures that betray a specific origin , especially for the southern regions . 
  italy : * local elections in several cities will show the political pulse of the country after the unholy left-right wing alliance . 
  will they be rejected in favor of grillo 's protest party ? 
  will berlusconi somehow win back some approval ? 
  who will become rome 's mayor ? 
  is there still a left wing party ? 
  * berlusconi 's ongoing trials . 
  the right wing says it 's now only political persecution and they 'll kill the government if he 's banned from public office . 
  the left does n't say anything because whatever they say it will be worse . 
  * italy has brought its deficit back under the european limits . 
  this will mean that some countermeasures can be relaxed . 
  what to do now ? 
  how do we restart the economy ? 
  * racism and intolerance . 
  an illegally immigrated black man killed some people with a pick in the middle of the road . 
  this triggered the usual wave of unpleasant comments from the right wing side . 
  and even the newly nominated minister kyenge - first black minister ever - was not spared . 
  let 's have some more immigration laws !, 
  see what happened in london and paris ? 
  * after a ` rebel ' priest well known for his unorthodox support for the rights of prostitutes , emarginated people and lgbt people died with lots of people celebrating him , after a gay teen wrote a moving letter to a newspaper comparing the courage of the lgbt-opposing french writer in committing suicide against his own courage in not committing suicide - somehow even some people in the right are wondering if , after all , equality is not so bad . 
  might there be a gay marriage law on the way ? 
  old politicians glued to their chairs with the help of the church . 
  i guess we have to wait for a few to , uh , get some rest . 
  i would not say really religious , especially among the younger people . 
  it 's the political class that it 's old and stale , and apparently really hard to dislodge . 
  see our dear friend berlusconi for an example . 
  homosexuality is biological . 
  it happens in lots of species , and it appears in men since they exists . 
  or are you asserting that is somehow is a ` modern ' or ` artificial ' behavior ? 
  as for the why there are several studies that link homosexuality with increased fertility in the female relatives and there is a hypotetical social benefit in having extra males that do n't compete for females but provide for their family/tribe . 
  that said it was you who stated that something ` natural ' is somehow ` better ' . 
  i 'm saying that this is false , and anyway whatever concept of ` natural ' you intend it also covers homosexuality . 
  define natural . 
  define natural state . 
  what is more ` natural ' ? 
  a house or living in the woods with wolves around and no shelter and no weapons ? 
  a medicine or dying from dysentery ? 
  a titanium screw in your ankle or dying because you ca n't walk with a broken bone ? 
  a family of 2 or a tribe of 20 that provides for everyone ? 
  the fact is the ` family of 2 ' is a product of modern times and as unnatural as a probe on mars and a telephone - which means nothing since they all are real . 
  the only unnatural thing are unicorns , wizards and flying whales . 
  the only argument would be if there 's a proven disadvantage in having anything different from a mother and a father in optimal conditions - but then you have to ban single mothers , poor families and handicapped fathers , if you want to be coherent .
