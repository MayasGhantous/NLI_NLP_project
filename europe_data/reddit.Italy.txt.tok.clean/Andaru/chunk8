  will he manage to brainwash enough people before the march/april elections ? 
  a somewhat obsolete one , but anyway : an italian , an american and a german sit together for lunch . 
  suddenly a buzzing is heard . 
  the german brings his hand to his face , thumb to the ear , little finger to the mouth , and talks for a while . 
  then he says : `` see ? 
  zuperior german engineering allows me to take care ov important business with telephone embedded in hand ! '', 
  a few minutes later a faint beeping is heard . 
  the american pokes his cheek with a finger and talks to himself for a while . 
  `` see ? 
  superior american technology allows me to take care of important business with a telephone embedded in my tooth ! '', 
  after a couple minutes the italian farts loudly . 
  everyone looks at him agape , but he confidently says : `` eh , it was just a fax . 
  i can read it after lunch . '', 
  they need to voluntarily register themselves - you can not force them . 
  and since technically they 're not under arrest holding them anywhere against their will is a grey area . 
  compound that with the fact that each country does n't really mind if they go away and here 's your conundrum served . 
  of course , but the root is still fuga . 
  and refuge comes from the word ` fuga ' , which means escape . 
  in italian you can also use ` profugo ' which is similar to the greek word , and still contains the same word . 
  you do know that you never get to elect the president , right ? 
  it should be covered in the civics books you get in school . 
  you elect the parliament and they elect the president . 
  this did not apply specifically to renzi , this has been so for a while . 
  drop them in the water ? 
  uh , unpleasant and illegal . 
  enter libyan waters without permission to drop them off ? 
  aww , now you 're violating a nation 's borders , is that an act of war ? 
  and they 're not going to admit being libyan any way . 
  drop them somewhere at random ? 
  oops , there 's international laws against that . 
  what else ? 
  they 'll simply say they 're not libyan . 
  also libya would have to agree with the repatriation , otherwise you can not simply show up and drop people there . 
  how do you close a sea exactly ? 
  does the plan also involve watching people drown from afar ? 
  either they do n't tell what their original country is right for this reason or their country has no functioning government/doesn ' t give a damn and is happy to let them go . 
  it 's one of the checks and balances of the state . 
  the judicial power can not act against the government directly . 
  the parliament has to approve proceedings against a member of the parliament before they can take effect . 
  italian : 's \u00ec ' for yes and ` no ' for no . 
  we also have ` ni ' as a fusion of both of them , meaning that something is only partially true . 
  a sort of `` well , yes and no ... '', 
  it 's the same deal with colors , species , whatever . 
  the distinction between dialects and languages is entirely arbitrary , so you have people arguing about where to draw the lines . 
  for some they 're all dialects , for others they 're all different languages . 
  sardinian is considered an entirely separate language rather than a dialect . 
  dialects are often actual separate languages , with different origins and influences , so they can be very different from standard italian in grammar and vocabulary . 
  in addition , in the last few decades , they were seen as the mark of the uncultured and their use was discouraged in schools and educated families . 
  today you only see dialects used among older people or close friends generally , but never with strangers or in tv unless for characterization purposes . 
  there 's nowadays a sort of revival of dialects as a way to recover past cultures and traditions , songs and literature , to the point that some regions want to instate a dialect class in schools , although this is generally seen as a political initiative to foster ` localism ' and independentism . 
  actually it should n't go to a vote , being an issue of rights . 
  our equivalent of the supreme court was called to sentence on the matter like the us one , but they found that it 's something that the parliament should address . 
  no automatic gay marriage , but there 's a gap in the law that must be filled so that the equality of rights is maintained . 
  you can not turn them back . 
  international law , treaties and agreements forbid it . 
  libya does not want foreign ships , so no . 
  furthermore to return them they have to provide their identity , which they refuse to do . 
  the latest poll places agreement with gay marriage at about 57 % . 
  support is much higher among young people and center/north italy . 
  ** italy ** ** tv ( main channels ) ** * ** rai 1 , 2 and 3 ** are state tv channels , whose directors are named by government commissions and therefore are generally aligned to the ruling party . 
  that said rai 3 has always been much more left-leaning than the others , while rai 1 was always the more conservative one . 
  the ** rai news ** channel has a reputation of being fairly balanced . 
  * ** mediaset channels ( canale 5 , italia 1 , rete 4 ) ** are berlusconi 's tvs , so they 're pretty much his mouthpieces . 
  it 's been years since i last watched them , so i 'm not sure about their state now , but during berlusconi 's golden years they were pretty ludicrous in their news spinning . 
  * ** la7 ** is somewhat of a third party , despite being controlled by an entrepreneur with some connections to berlusconi . 
  it has so far proved to be one of the most balanced news sources , with a bit of a leaning towards the left . 
  ** newspapers ** * ** repubblica ** is probably the most read newspaper and is definitely center-left ( pd ) aligned . 
  it used to be much more ` serious ' that it is now , but it too fell to some clickbaiting practices . 
  known also for the ` sidebar of crap ' which is full of the most useless pieces of news ever . 
  * ** corriere della sera ** is the main ` moderate ' newspaper , with slight center-right preferences , but generally fairly balanced . 
  * ** il giornale ** used to be one of the most respected right-wing newspapers , but is now a berlusconi-controlled rag , causing the loss of 10 points of qi when actually read . 
  * ** libero ** and ** il foglio ** are even worse right-wing and populist ` things ' . 
  if not already indoctrinated you 'll want to gouge your eyes out . 
  * ** il fatto quotidiano ** started out as a radical unaligned paper , but seems to have now taken to heart the m5s ( grillo 's ) cause and is generally anti-governative . 
  * ** il sole 24 ore ** business newspaper . 
  tends to look at the entrepreneur 's side of things . 
  there 's a lot more newspapers , each tied to one specific party or faction , with several more regional ones , but they 're probably less relevant . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp2udyzxp6g ) . 
  it 's still used as the reference for cringeworthiness several years after the fact . 
  it also helps to mention that the guy was minister of cultural heritage and the mentioned website cost something like 40 million $ , ending up being little more than a static page with a few pictures and horrible translation errors . 
  in italy there have been countless attempts at passing some sort on law on civil unions or associated variants , and they always got stuck on fights on minor points such as the name , the process , the tax effects , whatever until the government collapsed and the next one had to start anew . 
  in the meantime several cities decided to go ahead and open the registries to same sex unions no matter what , causing a number of reprimands , threats of consequences and stuff like that . 
  the supreme court has already cast doubts on the validity of such practices , recommending however that a law be made soon to address the issue . 
  as of now in fact it is possible for someone to get gay-married several times in different countries in europe , since the italian records office will not accept the marriage and will give the go-ahead to foreign offices inquiring about the marriage state of that person . 
  this could be fun in a few years time . 
  anyway there is yet another bill about to be discussed to enable same sex unions and this time it seems that renzi will see it through like he 's doing for other stuff , so maybe we 'll stop being gray on all these maps soon . 
  the expo is another name for the so-called world fair , which is held every few years in a country , a bit like the olympics . 
  this time it is being held in milan , around the theme of sustainable food production , more or less . 
  protests happened for a number of reasons : it is may 1st , which is always a good day for protests ; the expo is seen as a red herring to promote globalization and multinational corporations , which are seen as the mail culprits of the economic crisis and of unsustainable industry ; the expo itself is seen as a waste of money that could have been used for better purposes , and also it was the center point of yet another corruption scandal about tender assigments and shady business practices ; there were also several reports of workers being recruited with ridiculous contracts and meager pay , while the recruiting agencies pocketed a good chunk of the money . 
  there 's never a lack of reasons to protest ... 
  italy would probably be last in this ranking . 
  after ww2 , when italians voted to become a republic , the savoia royal family was exiled with a ` temporary ' article in the constitution . 
  said article was only removed a few years ago , and until then the savoias contented themselves with occasional off-the-scene comments nobody cared about ( and with the family head guy mostly coming off as an entitled jerk ) . 
  after the exile was repealed they tried to somehow become relevant again , including trying to launch the wanna-be prince as a singer with this [ masterpiece ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiill79mu7q ) here ( he 's the off-key middle guy - the lyrics talk about his heartfelt nostalgia for italy ) and maybe some reality show appearances . 
  all attempts failed rather badly . 
  nowadays nobody really cares about them apart from some fringe monarchist groups and nobody knows where they ended up . 
  i 'm gay , so i 'm probably biased , but i 've met an increasing number of people who do n't hide their being gay . 
  i work in software development and i have a few openly gay coworkers , and several people i 've talked with about being gay have been very supportive . 
  i know that it really depends on the place , but it seems that things are definitely improving . 
  appeals are a right of both parties .
