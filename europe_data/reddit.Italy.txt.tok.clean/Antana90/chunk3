  well played mate . 
  no , they are declared * persona non grata * and kicked out of the country with decree by the minister of interior . 
  there were about 200 in the last two years . 
  * do you see sch\u00e4uble 's wheelchair ? 
  he 1vs1 me once *, 
  kultur and civilt\u00e0 together , the two sides of a single coin . 
  nope , we do not have them . 
  i 'm amazed they used actual planes for * eurofighter * and not a picture of juncker with a helm and a sword . 
  i do like our column actually . 
  it is all good then !, 
  perfect , what a good news !, 
  thanks !, 
  thanks , let 's wait . 
  oh god we sent two canadairs yesterday . 
  former pms have this task , as you can see it 's very clean . 
  joking aside , probably somebody just climbs over and does the thing . 
  i 've got the inspiration from the post about romanian pm sitting alone during a session , let 's see how the government rooms around europe are !, 
  ** legnano intensifies **, 
  so it was like when the french president sarkozy conspired behind italy and told the libyans he would have helped in the civil war against gheddafi in exchange of italian oil concessions to be given to france , as it is from the leaked clinton 's mails . 
  or it is like when the uk funded with money political terrorism in italy during the lead years to destabilize as much as possible the country , as it results from the intelligences archives disclosed in the last years . 
  so as france and us conspiring against enrico mattei and eni because it was making italy independent from american and french oil companies . 
  so it is like when austria and germany government subsidized south tyrol/alto adige * preservation of german culture * , some of those money were used to cover the cost of an independentist campaing and even terrorism . 
  no country is as clean as you think , all governments are spying , even with mrs merkel saying otherwise . 
  i thought all canadians were actually polite ... internet lied to me once again . 
  uhm signonella is shared , half italian base and half american if i 'm not wrong . 
  they are not enemies , they are friends . 
  f r i e n d s and this is not going to change because they have a humansize cheeto in washington or you have granny snowwhite and macroney at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e . 
  let 's stop with this bullshit and focus on finding a diplomatic solution on the recent events . 
  we may not like the current policy of us , but their help was crucial for the western part of europe to get back on track after the horror of ww2 . 
  [ ** whatever the weather we must move together ** ] ( https://www.peacepalacelibrary.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/y-6691-4-1000x1362.jpg ) ( for those who may ask , the flag between germany and italy is the free territory of trieste , still not given back to italy when this poster was made ), 
  you are a man of good taste , the emperor likes you . 
  next step , bishopnetor : ** hasta la vista , infidel **, 
  why are you in need to vent your oven without knowing a thing about how our institutions work ? 
  it 's not that italians do n't trust italians and corruption has nothing to do with this , it is an endemic problem certainly but you are talking about the very heart of a country political institutions , not some town officer taking a bribe . 
  i 'm rather tired to see this circle jerk about italy and corruption that holds discussion in every damn italian related thread . 
  ** the system has been made to prevent under any circumstance the rise of a too strong power ** , it happens when an imbecile holds the power for 20 years committing the worst crimes and finally throws your country in a world war killing hundreds of thousands of your people and destroying everything . 
  our government may look unstable to all of you , but this country has faced years of political terrorism , mafia wars , revolts and everything like no one has ever had to deal with in western europe without crumbling , we are still here and we are not going anywhere . 
  well , as my grandpa would say , * me cojoni * . 
  and ? 
  contact between intelligence agencies and their work has n't changed a bit , communism is no more in italy too but giorgio napolitano served as president of the republic for 9 years ... do i have to remind you that vladimir putin is an ex of the communist kgb ? 
  it 's not that the people in power in the former soviet union or in cold war italy disappeared with the fall of berlin wall . 
  and much better looking if you ask me . 
  i do not know what is going on with all this saturation ... 
  ecb can very well stay away from italian gold and never think to use it , as much as all the italians suggesting the same . 
  that treasure does not belong to us , present italians , but to the ones who will come after us . 
  that is what the country may need some day if something really bad happens , it is to be preserved not be touched in any way . 
  but also the country with by far the strongest communist party of all western block . 
  it is a bit of a long question to explain in a comment ( from my phone ) but think of italy as the place where russia and usa were secretly confronting themselves , it has been seen during the cuba crisis ( in that the vatican too ) and in many other occasions . 
  some of the most prominent italian communists , giorgio napolitano is one of the most notable names , were sort of middlemen with the urss . 
  edit1 words, 
  brutal ... but i suppose it is still better than what happened to [ the last one who attempted scottish independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_wallace#capture_and_execution ) . 
  honestly the lack of an ambassador in what us should consider a key ally is kinda `` strange '' . 
  but it 's not that gentiloni is flinging our country in russia 's arms . 
  we have always been the bridge between moscow and washington since the cold war , it has n't changed a bit . 
  i ca n't see a brain here . 
  rome is full of * palazzi * but this one has michelangelo as architect , it 's certainly something peculiar . 
  well , it reflects properly the history behind it i suppose . 
  and this is true for both the palaces . 
  it 's just the usual banter between france and italy on nice pictures . 
  i do like macron 's studio and i think it is majestic no less . 
  this is a very elegant way to compliment my country , thanks . 
   well ... not really italians.french , when they `` protected '' rome and the pope . 
  yeah , the pope kinda felt overprotected by napoleon . 
  and if you are referring to napoleone the third , well , god bless porta pia . 
  it was given to france by the italian government in use for 99 years in the 30s , so thanks to the italians . 
  she may be the senate !, 
  despite all the bickering with our cousins , we gave them the best embassy possibile . 
  * palazzo farnese * is a rare gem in rome . 
  the french one is french . 
  that 's why i told you i 'm not an expert :d for what i remeber from my art class they could be afforded only by the wealthiest nobles and sometimes they were customized with the family crest . 
  only to be used in the most splendid halls . 
   but seriously , this is better than the french one . 
  i like you . 
  well , they are a considered a form of high art , a pure display of wealth and power for the noble houses in the past . 
  the most famous example i know is [ raffaello 's arazzi ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/arazzi_di_raffaello ) for the sistine chapel , they were commissioned to an artisan on his drawings . 
  but i 'm not really an expert . 
  no , it 's an * arazzo * . 
   corrupted we have just said to not generalize ... italy has corruption problem , no question on that , but some of the statistics used are based on * perceived corruption * ... in a self deprecating country where the faith on political system is as high as a dwarf ... make your consideration . 
  eh , you quoted berlusconi . 
  problem is we italians have swallowed insults from people of other countries ( not just banter ) for years . 
  we were described as lewd , corrupted and perverted beings just because he was our pm . 
  treated as a laughing stock much more than others , even with decent scandals around the place ( clinton , sarkozy shagging even the gardenias in his yard , cameron digging his dick in a pork head and with money offshore and so on ) . 
  well , now that it is your turn , remember this for the future : governments very rarely are the embodiment of their people . 
  upvoted , because i do not like hostility towards your people . 
  i might want to have a word on your government but other than that , this whole thing is something unpleasant to see . 
  edit1 a word, 
  mate , we are just bantering here , italy and us have wonderful bilateral relations and as you said it was just him scratching his head . 
  much amore from italia . 
  now i can explain deluca . 
  yeah , that 's what they keep saying to us ... [ ** evil laugh in italian ** ] ( https://i.redd.it/5ds7nsyvl6uy.jpg ), 
  honestly i would not have minded a * classe-panettone *, 
  you have a point on that . 
  he did n't get two scoops of gelato , did he ? 
  yep , and i 'm surprised my comment about the migrant crisis has n't been buried as well . 
  well , i wish you both the best . 
  have a nice day !, 
  you are right !, 
  i forgot them . 
  hey people , i 've found the funny guy here !, 
  three words : erdogan closest neighbor,
