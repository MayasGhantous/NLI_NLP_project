  yeah , but that austrian navy was made for a good part by italians from veneto and the other lands still under the empire . 
  from their ships it is said you could hear roaring `` san marco !, 
  san marco !, 
  let me present to you the old italian minesweepers during the 50s , [ classe-aragosta ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/classe_aragosta ) , literally lobster-class . 
   latina ostia you mean , latina was kinda of swamp . 
  roma is not on the sea , but we had a battleship named after it . 
  it 's not where they are but what they represent !, 
  it actually does not in the specific but it 's the national embodiment of england , so a symbol somehow nationalistic . 
  it was just a joke on thresa may going back to `` imperial desires '' ( albion ) , it was not meant as disrespect , i was just underlining the fact that belgium and the nederlands do not have any threat near them , so they do not need a huge fleet . 
  we summoned him at the very end !, 
  thanks u/d _ mitch !, 
  well , unless theresa going full albion it 's not that they have to control nor defend a huge portion of sea . 
  you did well !, 
  is there something with swedish people and italian girls ? 
  pewdiepie started the whole trend , i tell you . 
  i know you were joking < 3 , and the slovenes will not mind because the border is set and that 's it , let 's all cope with it and live together in peace . 
  please , do not make me go full wet dream . 
  anyways , * amerigo vespucci * is already in use . 
  for the others we will see :d edit1 wait , how the ... do you speak italian ? 
  i think a possible name for a second ship of this class would be * trento * . 
  * trieste * is being built/launched/commissioned in a close time span to the 100 year anniversary of ww1 victory , so i do not think we will see any more its with pola , fiume or zara . 
  gorizia might be used and i do not see why not . 
  well , garibaldi is the worldwide known italian national hero and cavour is the first italian prime minister , one of the greatest actors in the italian re-unification process . 
  so they got a bit of priority when it comes to name something ... 
  * trieste * will be laid down this summer and it 's more similar to a * wasp-class * , with a really big carrying capability for men and stuff ; in addition they have started building the ppas ( pattugliatore polivalente d'altura ) , hell of new frigates with 3 different set-ups . 
  two different classes , that 's why . 
  and the name , well , why not ? 
  oilers can be kinda hot , perhaps not in a way the crew on board would like !, 
  we have n't seen an euro yet and in addition all the promises of fair sharing among members to relocate the immigrants across the continent never happened . 
  but guess what ? 
  you can always hear a gentleman from nothern europe claming they are the one respecting treaties and everything . 
  bad italy , bad !, 
  edit , a word, 
  [ ahem ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6ds28d/british_navy_or_royal_navy_predicted_size_for/ ), 
  since french and britons have sent their infograpics , our turn !, 
  thanks to [ navalanalyses ] ( http://navalanalyses.blogspot.it/ ) and its editor , u/d _ mitch, 
  yep , if you look where ancona is you will understand why , it 's the shape of the natural port due to monte conero behind her . 
  all the credits to the author u/d _ mitch , also editor of navalanalyses.blogspot.com . 
  not just southern italy , my family comes from ancona ( ankon ) , central italy , the northernmost known greek settlement . 
  a quick note for italy . 
  the budget of defense has always been around 1,6 % of our gdp , the cuts to the expenditure between 2015 and 2016 were about 10 billions ( shiverings ) . 
  apparently they will increase it bit by bit from next year ( a raise to 1.4 % of gdp ) . 
  edit1 [ source for 2017 , link in italian ] ( http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2016/11/23/armi-e-militari-litalia-spende-64-milioni-al-giorno-dati-smentiscono-la-difesa-stanziamenti-11/3208347/ ), 
  fun fact partially related . 
  during the sigonella crisis between us and italy , craxi ( the italian pm at that time ) middlefingered ronald reagan and his spy-network wandering in rome suburbs on a normal car and using public telephones to give orders . 
  that was very effective . 
  and yes , as you said , every country spies on its allies , it 's normal business . 
  and that is not the way it works . 
  profits are already taxed ( at the lowest levels possible ) from the eastern contries and even if they come back to italy , or other countries , as private capital ( savings ) , they still do n't have the same active value in terms of jobs and overall economic power as the investiment made in the eastern economy . 
  in addition moving jobs from a country to an other destroys the working tissue of the starting place ( in this case western countries ) to improve the one in the ending place and of course enlarges the profits of the corporations doing so ( lesser working cost , lesser taxes , lesser overall production costs ) . 
  tax elusion ( or evasion ) has very little to do with this , everything happened in the last years with jobs moving to the east is just a simple way to exploit a rightful free trade/market system . 
  edit1 words, 
  no calm down . 
  i 'm not advocating the system proposed in the article , what pisses me off is the idea , according to your comment , that italy is freeloading stuff . 
  i 'm deeply sorry to remind that , despite everything , we are still one of the big cheese of europe and the net contriobution italy gives to the whole system is very much necessary to also sustain funding projects for countries such as romania . 
  and the whole pitch of our comments is really pissing me off , because eastern countries are developing faster and faster due to the heavy investments western economies have done in your areas . 
  i have never said you live off our back but seriously , you are in need of a general revise of how things work . 
  edit , a word, 
  gentle reminder that your country is heavily funded by europe thanks to italy and its net-contribution . 
  edit1 a word, 
  in italy a meteorologist laughing for bad weather and low temperatures in summer ( during * le ferie * ) would be flayed alive and his head showed in the nearest seaside-resort for people amusement . 
  tat , will i ever hear a pleasant thing about italy coming from your account ? 
  just asking in case the doomsday will be soon upon us . 
  it was the foch , not the cl\u00e9menceau that france sold to brasil . 
  his kettle was empty , that 's all . 
  in fact it 's a light aircraft carrier , to be precise it is classified as aircraft carrying cruiser . 
  if you look at him it does not only carry planes and helicopters but also have capabilities against subs , anti-a and anti-ship . 
  it was made to be versatile . 
  i link you here a comment of mine in a thread related to this [ ship ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/warshipporn/comments/686yn2/the_italian_aircraft_carrier_giuseppe_garibaldi/dgwfjbx/ ), 
  no , lamborghini are still fully made in italy and developed by completely different research facilities , still all italian . 
  and in this you have my full support . 
  italy and uk have made wonderful things together . 
  indeed , but read again my comment . 
  i was answering back the assumption that italy has no building quality . 
  despite the fact most of the materials we use and other contries use are fully made here . 
  last year leonardo-finmeccanica got a 28 eurofighters commission from kuwait for almost 8 billions ... and so on and on and on . 
  interesting , too bad they are mcdonnell douglas-bae av-8b harrier ii , we bought them from the americans and a good chunk of them are completely made in italy under license . 
  you helped designing them . 
  as we helped in many other models . 
  edit1 made in italy part . 
  yeah , no worries , the norwegian ones come with bridles for rudolph and company . 
  i 'm eager to see the famous british build quality , all in consideration that you have almost two carriers ready and not a single plane . 
  finally !, 
  the arrival of f35-b will give an immense boost in capabilities to the * cavour * aircraft carrier . 
  it was about time . 
  lol, 
  it 's not something [ particular ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x9p9wdm6ya&amp; ) , any prime minister/president in the world when visit a foreign contry is received in this way . 
  it 's called * onori militari * here , the photographer just took the right * meme-moment * . 
  here is a video from the may-renzi bilateral with the part you are looking for . 
  it 's simply a salute of the commanding officer , the camera stopped on the right meme moment . 
  he is from 8th cavalry regiment lancieri di montebello . 
  i have never , ever heard of someone not considering evolution a fact here in italy . 
  even the catholic church considers this a scientific truth . 
  in the italian version of googlemaps is still * repubblica ceca * , i 've just checked . 
  get him champ, 
  allow me to say thank you for two big reasons . 
  the first one to have answered this post and being very gentle in doing that . 
  the second for giving us a bit of context about the situation . 
  if you are there tomorrow i 'm looking forward to your comments too !, 
  edit * words,
