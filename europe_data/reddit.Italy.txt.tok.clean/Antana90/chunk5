  tomorrow r/italy will have a shared thread with argentina and i will ask about this topic . 
  but i must say , i support uk on this , the people living there are british and voted to remain so , no question on that . 
  * ( we are romans , we are italians . 
  being born and living in italy is a gift ; being born and living in rome is a privilege ) *, 
  ayy lmaoreto, 
  we have traditions to mantain . 
  the most stable of our `` pms '' got a peculiar upside-down treatment . 
  edit1 a word, 
  i still hate him but at least he has n't got us into war with a lie in front of the parliament . 
  even bricks in the walls here in italy knew at the time that we were going in iraq to * `` peacekeep '' * for oil ... and as political asset to the americans ... edit1 added `` here in italy '', 
  if you look for professor cavalli-sforza , the founder of * genetics of populations * , you will find out that there is much more than people usually think . . just a reminder that the so called invasions after the fall of the roman empire were in the order of 50k-100k , the italian peninsula had about 10 millions people population at that time ( according to other a little bit less but still high ) . 
  make your proportion . 
  [ here is an article ] ( http://www.eupedia.com/genetics/storia_genetica_degli_italiani.shtml ) , there is also an english version of it . 
  edit1 words, 
  i 'm not feeling well ... 
  [ \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tl1qokz_imk/umi2qfwpuri/aaaaaaaaada/c_0uqlnhapo/s1600/540837_473683766011280_592870982_n.jpg ) / s of course, 
  [ the lombard league agrees ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvonv7huzlg ), 
  speaking of r/place , [ this would have been the final project if we and the britons had enough time . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eccqhsq.png ) the result is still very good . 
  love you britishbros . 
  edit * in addition , even if we battled for the bottle , here is the commemoration stamp between italy and france for [ rome and paris sister cities ] ( http://www.costajonicaweb.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/097.jpg ), 
  [ goddamn schulz is coming out of the fucking walls !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/xxuty7ss1v4?t=3m3s ), 
  they should put some cameras on the sea too , all that brutal poldering ... poor north sea ... edit * / s if it was n't clear . 
  so you said that italians are notoriously perverted and then i 'm the stupid and rude italian . 
  of course . 
  everyone knows about the bucket war :d, 
  hear , hear !, 
  i 've studied a shitton of philology when i was in highschool during my latin course , it was my favourite parts . 
  in how a word has spead you can read the history of the people in that area . 
  it 's fascinating !, 
  caro/cara is an abjective , it is used to underline something that you like , that you have affection for , that you love . 
  anima means soul , you can use also the word * spirito * but it has a different connotation . 
  very interesting !, 
  how peculiar , * anima cara * in italian means a good/friend soul, 
   `` seelenverwandte ( r ) '' is it used to scare him/her away ? 
  / s ^ sorry i feel bad for this joke but i could not resist ^ :(, 
  you are very welcome !, 
  a * lost cause * ? 
  / s anyways we call it an * amore platonico * , or if the feeling are not that strong you can maybe use * anima affine * . 
  i see , but for sure here when you think to west coast you think to california and the warm climate part . 
  well , we have west and east coast but we do not call them in this way . 
  we use the name of the sea , that 's why they are called `` costa tirrenica '' and `` costa adriatica '' , or versante , which means side . 
  anyways for west coast i think to los angeles and san francisco , and california of course . 
  does seattle count for west coast ? 
  please do not flay me . 
  i basically use shit form both because of the way i have learned it . 
  in italy practice generally sucks but we study a lot grammar and literature in high school , strictly on the british side . 
  that 's why i 'm used to write ** armour ** and not * armor * , or ** lorry ** and not * truck * . 
  but the point is my english knowledge has developed after watching a fuckton of tv series in the original language , to the point that right now i do need subs of any kind to watch them or films , and the largest part of those series/movies were from us , so i 'm quite confortable with the other side of the coin too . 
  mostly italian stuff . 
  * [ biffi ] ( https://rsbackend.blob.core.windows.net/product/gran-maionese-tubetto-biffi_8d10b746376ec15.jpg ) for mayonaise , calv\u00e9 sometimes . 
  * [ orco ] ( http://viatraveldesign.com/journal/archives/orcopj9.jpg ) for the mustard * biffi/heinz for ketchup, 
  * tutto il mondo \u00e8 paese * after all ... 
  well , in the later years some political party there started quite a racist campaign against * frontalieri * , those workers who live in italy and work beyond the border in switzerland . 
  so much that it arrived even in our national press when this [ happened ] ( http://www.migrantitorino.it/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/4.jpg ) , what a fine work of art !, 
  the point is those workers are very much necessary to their economy since there are no people there to take those jobs , in addition we are talking about a large range of workers , from the shop assistant to the surgeon , so not just unskilled labourers . 
  aww thanks . 
  i 've visited munich and the region around , my brother spent the 4th year of high school in weiden for an exchange project so i visited him for a couple of weeks , you are lovely people as well . 
  the french are stubborn , and i see in it a quality that help them in a lot of things , but sometimes their politics is kinda jerkish towards us . 
  but i do not dislike them . 
  slovenia is a wonderful little gem in the heart of europe , they got influenced a lot in their architecture both by us and the austrians , it is a very very nice place to visit with kind people . 
  austria is beautiful and with lovely people . 
  switzerland gives me different feelings , i do not like how some of the italian population there treat us ( the story is long to tell though ) . 
  but it is a beautiful country , no question on that . 
  san marino betrayed us during eurovision so i kinda wish fat-kim aims at them instead of guam , as every good marchigiano i would not mind to have romagna roasted as well . 
  vatican , screw it and the pope . 
  aww < 3, 
  '' ` morning george '' , said archibald to the tree ... ** the tree answered back **, 
   scunthorpe what the fuck is an industrial ** garden ** town ? 
  i mean , the garden is the park where you pollute with toxic wastes ? 
  good luck to the french , first pm monti in 2011 and later the current mayor of rome blocked the ethernal city application to the ioc because the costs are enormous and , according to studies , there is not a certain return of the investments on the long run . 
  so i wish the french well . 
  let me give you my honest , humble e pragmatic response very . 
  [ you ] ( https://archive-media.nyafuu.org/wsr/image/1451/88/1451882173413.jpg ), 
  for me quite often , i mean i was little more than a kid when we switched but i still count in * lire * , especially on very expensive things . 
  i know it 's stupid but it 's an instinct i ca n't get rid of . 
  i give a 11/10 wiith gouda for the effort . 
  there are very good chefs in us and wonderful restaurants , what honestly makes me sad is that every american with an italian surname believes he is authorized to cook and call it italian food . 
  i have seen things beyond imagination with my flag on top or an italian sounding name . 
  no , no and no . 
  i have nothing against these people but in italy if you want to be a chef there is a proper high school and years of training . 
  it 's not something anyone can do . 
  i would suggest them to train and then show off what they can really cook according to the tradition or innovation eventually . 
  just this . 
  edit * a word, 
  lybia ( to be fair the three provinces later called in this way ) was taken in a war against the ottoman empire . 
  eritrea was bought and then expandend . 
  somalia started with a protectorate later transformed in colony . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  the only piece of land promised was tunisia , taken by france , forcing italy to join the entente as retaliation . 
  yeah , the italo-turkish war , the mahadist war were clearly puppy eyes . 
  ethiopia was invaded in 1935 and annexed in the 1936 . 
  the follow up led italy into hitler 's arms because , you know , an empire with a fifth of the globe , responsible of unspeakable atrocities , can easily have the moral highground to sanction an other colonial power for its wars . 
  anyways , the past is the past . 
  in addition , eritrea , where italy had power for over 50 years , still benefits today of railroads , roads and general infrastructures built during the colonial period , as much as very good relation with italy , it was the most benevolent and loyal to us . 
  same for the coastal part of libya ( but there is a lot to say on how italy crashed the rebels in a very inhuman way ) . 
  about somalia not much to say , the colonial administration even after ww2 was too weak to protect and prepare the following independent state . 
  edit1 a word, 
  fully ageed .
