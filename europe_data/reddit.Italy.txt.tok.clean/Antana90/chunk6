  it is a celebration to remember also the atrocity and the pain a war brings . 
  we are in peace and we should never forget how precious is this gift . 
  italians had been at war with other italians for over a millennia and i 'm not joking , from small towns to city-states to even larger parts of the peninsula , many wars through the centuries in every part of the modern country . 
  however our last civil war was between the fascits and the royalists/antifascists from 1943 and 1945 . edit1 a aword, 
  for us it 's the 4th november , we will have stuff too , in rome of course and basically everywhere . 
  the alpini will make their annual meeting next year in trento . 
  also a lot of special events in museums and everything . 
  if anyone is in rome i strongly suggest to visit the vittoriano/altare della patria . 
  edit . 
  almost forgot , * trieste * our new aircraft carrier , will be laid down this summer , the name is not a coincidence and there will be a commemoration and a ceremony as far as i know . 
  probably the one with san marino . 
  a curious fact , i live near to what was one of the oldest border in the world and ceased to exist with italian re-unification , the one between two sicilies and papal states on the tronto river , fixed in the year 1081 . 
  it is still a sort of border btw , now between marche and abruzzo regions, 
  thank you very much for your kind and unbiased proposal but no , and it is not irrelevant as the gentleman above stated . 
  we italians love it a lot . 
  november 4th , end of ww1 for italy , is the ** festa delle forze armate ** ( armed forces celebration ) and the remembrance day for all the fallen . 
  in every town of italy there is a stele , generally close to the townhall or on its walls with the list of all the fallen and the [ bollettino della vittoria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bollettino_della_vittoria ) , that day a flowers and leaves crown is put beneath it by the mayor . 
  in addition the president , in rome , visits the milite ignoto ( unknown soldier ) at the [ altare della patria ( also called vittoriano ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/altare_della_patria ) and gives his tribute on beahalf of all italians . 
  this is the unknown soldier at the [ altare ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/vittorianomiliteignoto2-steo153.jpg ), 
  fucking hell , wrong thread !, 
  it was meant for the number of showers !, 
  thanks for writing me . 
  oh well , since i 'm here , i 'm 184 cm , but i would say i 'm on an average level , perhaps a little more . 
  once a day . 
  during summer i may have two showers in particularly hot days to cool myself a bit . 
  usa and canada , a bit of mexico and japan for sure . 
  i would also like to see china . 
  first thing : executing all people not using ** its ** and * it 's * in a correct way . 
  - maple syrup , thank you canada . 
  - rice noodles . 
  once my payment check did n't arrive in time and i did n't want to ask for money to my father . 
  there was almost a week ahead of me due to some holidays and i had only 5 $ . 
  i still remember what i bought at the discount - pasta 4kg * 0.80 = 3,20 $ - passata ( tomato sauce ) 0,60 * 2 = 1,20 $ - 6 eggs ( they were with promotional price ) = 0.59 $ i had at home enough butter and oil and some cans of beans and tuna , plus 1kg of apples and of course coffee ... everything is fine when you are italian and you breath with pasta . 
  edit1 a word, 
  not at all , medio oriente for that part . 
  please , consider that i was talking about guns diffusion . 
  i know it 's a rather safe place to stay of course . 
  apologies if i have n't explained myself properly . 
  the fact that he does not share your opinion does n't justify you to insult him . 
  that sentence is quite well known since years and its origin has nothing to do with that massacre . 
  as much as this law has nothing to do with our security . 
  quite well said . 
  i do not like this law at all . 
  italy has already very tight dispositions concerning weapons , and they are working fine , i do not see why we should bend the knee on this . 
  listen , the only gun i have ever seen close to me in my entire life is the beretta my father used in his service as policeman . 
  other than that in a town with 15k inhabitants the only thing we have close to a weaponry is a * `` hunting and fishing store '' * , was it really necessary to do this big fuss over a non problem ? 
  the possession of a weapon is already strictly regulated , this change is just a draconian bullshit made to appease some kind of unjustified concern . 
  we are not us and we will never be about weapons , let 's not change what is already working , we can have the exact opposite effect on public opinion with this kind of law . 
  thank you for finding the time and giving me your interpretation . 
  i do actually agree and if i consider the fact that i 'm not an optimistic person at all ... at the end it is true , we are all grains of sand blown away dy the streght of the events . 
  edit1 a word, 
  i do not speak french , but i have to say i understand the lyrics , at least written down . 
  it makes sense of course . 
  but i could not resist the desire to reply at that . 
   brits :[ ... ] speaks english well . 
  astonishing . 
  this thread will be on fire in no time . 
  - * spaniards * , it all started well and ended with a free * hijo de puta * and other compliments just for killing him ( if opponent ) or disappointing him ( if he is in your team ) . 
  they rage-quit a lot . 
  - * germans * , i divide them in ** edgelords ** under 15 years old ( toxic like cyanide ) , and ** gentlemen ** older than 15 years . 
  apparently they have some kind of turning point . 
  the second category is the one i prefer in online games . 
  - * britons * , if you do not talk like the fucking duke of edinburgh you are not worthy of their attention nor any respect . 
  generally very toxic and prone to tilting . 
  - * russians * , they swarm in free to play games and they will never speak to you in english . 
  some of them are competent and will carry the shit out of your team . 
  - * americans * , i generally enojoy them in team , they can cooperate and they do not mind your mistakes . 
  some of them go full murica , spraying shit all over the place . 
  - * italians * , we hate to play against other italians and with other italians ( if we do not know each other ) and we generally insult each other on a geographical base . 
  if in the oppponent team there are french or germans we go full * roma invicta * , we forget about our eternal civil war and tryhard like there is no fucking tomorrow ahead of us . 
  edit1 i 've forgotten the * french * , probably it is my subconscious fault . 
  i have met amicable french , i think i 'll write a book about this experience . 
  overall no particular opinions on them . 
  edit2 it 's a bit of banter boys . 
  do not overspeculate too much on this . 
  do you remember the barbaric invasions ? 
  kids here apparently are like pepperidge farm , they remember . 
  lol, 
  formally the last monarch was humbert ( umberto ) ii of italy , son of victor emanuel iii , who ruled as king for about a month ( he is sometimes nicknamed re di maggio , king of may , for that ) . 
  it is unknown if the italian referendum between monarchy and republic was partially or totally scammed , or clean and fair , what i can tell is that he was respected by everyone ( even togliatti , the secretary of italian communist party called him `` a nice lad '' after a brief meeting ) and for how he behaved after the vote he ** must ** take huge considerations . 
  he could have called for an other civil war and trust me , many people would have followed his lead and his orders . 
  but instead of asking other blood from his people and his country , with a touching declaration , he ordered to all the men serving in the italian forces that their oath to the king was no more , but not the one 's to the italians and the country . 
  after that he went in exile as the last of our monarchs , taking with him almost a thousand of years old dinasty that has always ruled along its history . 
  the faults of his father , king victor emanuel iii , dragged the italian monarchy into the dirt . 
  the king was a key factor of mussolini 's power . 
  he let him in charge of the government , he let him change the albertine statute in order to transform italy in a full dictatorship in 1925 . 
  he signed the racial laws and after that he accepted mussolini 's plan to start a war that ** nobody ** wanted . 
  victor emanuel iii let his country to be ruled by a criminal and did nothing to stop that untill the very end , when the war was alreay in the country and the allies had their feet in sicily . 
  it was him that lost to his dinasty the throne . 
  sweater on top of a shirt , dark colours generally . 
  jeans or more confortable dark velvet trouser . 
  lunch : water and wine as beverages , generally a primo piatto , might be pasta , a risotto or even a minestra . 
  a vegetable side dish and fruit . 
  a bit of cheese sometimes . 
  dinner : a bit of meat , vegatables , fish sometimes . 
  fruit and a sweet treat . 
  does mankind count ? 
  stupidity and lack of awareness about the reality , i do not like people who idolize blindly something or someone , nor the opposite . 
  happy , even if the things are n't going well . 
  it is useless to keep a long face .
