  [ you want to take a look ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xvwwrid.png ) and i think that does n't show also the various greek languages in the south . 
  anyway , that is very detailed , but words and small pronunciation can even change within different part of a city . 
  i do n't know , i do n't really think he thought we were arabs because my friends do n't look like ones . 
  but i can understand it , i know they may have had some problems with tourists in some clubs and i do n't really blame them that much . 
  a good screening is at the base of a good club . 
  a man hating on cartago is a good man in my book !, 
  yeah sure , `` maybe '' ... :p, 
  eh , i 've been called moroccan before . 
  and when i grow a beard i look arab . 
  maybe we just found a douchebag , the rest of the stay was pretty great full of nice people . 
  btw i think he did n't let us in not because we were specifically italians , but just because we were n't swedish . 
  same thing happened to me and some friends in sweden , they would n't let us in because we were italians . 
  it took me a while to accept this , but i kinda like france ... 
  i 'm an italian living in spain and , as much as it cost me to say this , i would never put french food behind spanish . 
  it 's just another tier , but hey , de gustibus non disputandum est. 
  in south italy you do n't gift scissors , they cut friendships . 
  thank you . 
  i would do that , but that 's just me . 
  it depends on what you like . 
  i would say paris and rome . 
  `` only paris is worthy of rome ; only rome is worthy of paris '' but the truth is that you ca n't choose just two cities to represent the entire europe . 
  not usually , at least men do n't do it . 
  we `` kiss '' the left cheek . 
  i say `` kiss '' because it 's a slightly touch with the cheek . 
  south italy , it is common to have 2 `` kisses '' while saying hi to relatives , it is also common with close friends . 
  it 's right and than left , now i 'm living in spain and it was kinda difficult to get used to the reverse . 
  the magna graecia is close to my city , the place has its big problems , but god damn if it is not beautiful . 
  unfortunately we both had a taste of centralized power . 
  alright , i wrote a comment some times ago and i 'll use it again !, 
  in italy every dialect is really different from the standard italian , mostly there is a light version of the dialect that is just italian with the cadence and accent of that region and some words slightly different , and then there is the real dialect that it 's totally different from italian , basically another language . 
  if i talk with someone from milan and we use our dialect we probably would never understand each other , but the funny thing is that if i move up in my region and speak my city 's dialect i would have almost the same problems , hell , if i move in different part of my city words can change a little . 
  i 'll speak about the dialect of my city , reggio calabria , that being near sicily is similar to the eastern sicilian . 
  in the city we often speak a light dialect similar to italian , but moving away from the city you find a heavy dialect , accent and cadence . 
  on the ionian coast , the so called `` magna graecia , you can still find few old people talking greek calabrian that of course nobody understand . 
  [ here for my greek brothers ] ( https://youtu.be/uklj3dpc2-y?t=6m5s ) unfortunately it 's almost a dead language , sad . 
  we are in the middle of the mediterrean and had a lot of influence and rulers , so our dialect is a mix , i 'll give some examples for every influence we had . 
  first we had the greek with the magna graecia and some words are : dialect | greek | english -- | -- | -- purtu\u00e0llu | portok\u00e0los | orange ( fruit ) putrus\u00ecnu | petroselinom | parsley ` nnaca | nake | cradle cirasa | kerasa | cherry the latinization came later because we had the possibility to keep the greek language and cultur under the romans and later the byzantines spoke greek , actually it seems that most of the latin words came during the norman invasion that brought some vulgar latin words , so : dialect | latin | english -- | -- | -- ( a ) undi | unde | where orbu | orbum | blind sduvacari | devacare | to empty for a couple of years we had the saracens , so a couple of arab words appeared , i think mostly borrowed from sicilian dialect | arab | english -- | -- | -- gebbia | geb\u1e25 | watering place tamarro | tamar | dates ( fruit ) seller ( someone impolite ) finally we got the normans and the house of anjou and here you can see french words and also words similair in english because of the norman - english history dialect | norman/french | english -- | -- | -- bucceri | bouchier | butcher mustazzi | moustache | moustache raggia | rage | rage accattari | acheter | buy surici | souris | mouse later aragon conquered us , so we got a little bit of spanish and catalan for 300 years dialect | spanish/catalan | english -- | -- | -- cucchiara | cuchara | spoon mugghieri | mujer | wife muccaturi | mocador | handkerchief scupetta | escopeta | rifle prescia | pressa | hurry cuntari | contar | to tell friiri | freir | to fry later the french basically ruled the king of naples so we got words like dialect | french | english -- | -- | -- addumari | allumer | set alight and that 's it i guess | edit : another thing , in the south we use the plural `` voi '' instead of `` lei '' as formal pronoun , basically like the french . 
  the `` voi '' was used before the `` lei '' that i think come from the spanish `` usted '' . 
  the `` lei '' was banned under fascism because it 's feminine and of italian origins . 
  i hate when i have to use the `` lei '' and i wish the `` voi '' would become accepted again . 
  mostly english speaking countries , i can see that . 
  also they are pretty close at the end and many people could travel to those place and fill the stadiums . 
  i love bluegrass and country but unfortunately it 's not popular here . 
  we are also talking about south italy , no idea how the situation is in the north but it 's probably similar . 
  where does garth brooks tour in europe ? 
  that would give us a pretty big hint . 
  i prefer a decentralized government and the same federal system used in the states , with the federal government having only some powers and no `` jurisdiction '' in some fields . 
  probably i would even go to the situation of the states during the xix century . 
  i think it would just depend on how he would act after becoming president . 
  generally states act just with real interests in mind , most of the states dealt , and still do , with way worse leaders than trump , so as long he does n't go crazy i do n't see how the relations would be strained . 
  also we are talking about 4/8 years , it would be unwise to ruin relations for that short amount of time . 
  we did n't backstab anyone in wwi . 
  calabria : we pronounce words that start with `` r '' as if they started with two . 
  it 's required by law . 
  you can drink it alone during breakfast but usually people eat something like a croissant with it . 
  sorry i do n't know what you mean with `` snack coffee '' !, 
  [ this is a cappuccino ] ( http://icon-static.panorama.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cappuccino-000021214508_large-950x514.jpg?bf3093 ) it 's basically just coffee with foamed milk , you are supposed to drink it during breakfast but not after meals because it 's `` heavy '' . 
  it reminds me of foreign people who orders cappuccino after a meal , that 's a nono . 
  or generally , at least if you do n't know what you are doing , you do n't pair a red wine with fish or white wine with meat . 
  also for me pasta is just for lunch , i never understood people who eats it a dinner , but many italians would disagree with me . 
  but yeah , spaghetti for breakfast it 's pretty strange . 
  actually in italy the rule is to eat sweet things , milk , coffee , marmalade , croissants etc. 
  i do n't like them and i usually eat savoury things . 
  we use the english ones and also we use `` asd '' as a laugh . 
  it was born in the gaming community because you can write it without moving your finger from wasd . 
  same here . 
  `` quad '' and `` moto d'acqua '', 
  well , you guys take your `` cafe con leche '' in winter very seriously . 
  i usually ask for an espresso , and when i do i ask them to make it even more `` cortito '' jaja !, 
  i noticed something about olive oil , you guys have really good olive oil but it 's not cheap , the cheapest one are not that great . 
  here in italy even the cheapest ones are pretty good , apart from the fact that in the south we usually have local olive oil . 
  you guys have good stuff too , we have great jamon , but yours is a looooot better . 
  i like spanish cousine , but sometimes i feel like something is missing and i do n't know what is it . 
  but hey , i would drink ca\u00f1as eating tapas all my life if i could . 
  especially pescado and marisco . 
  exactly !, 
  i moved to spain last winter and it 's almost like i never left italy . 
  i feel you for the pig screams , they are not easy to listen to , especially when other pigs hear them and start to join in . 
  they know they are getting killed . 
  i eat everything . 
  i used to go spearfishing , so i killed some fish , octopuses etc that i killed , cleaned and cooked . 
  nothing big or special . 
  my uncle had some rabbits and chickens , when i was younger and we had bbq dinners together i always watched the process , even helping to kill the rabbits . 
  yup , i know . 
  i 'm currently in spain and i 'm also using spanish in my keyboard and i did n't notice it came out like that , not that it was so different anyway . 
  the only official language is italian . 
  in trentino and valle d'aosta we also have official german and french . 
  various other languages are not official but are `` protected '' , passing from dialects to full languages such as greek , croatian , catal\u00e1n , albanian etc. 
  dialects are basically entire languages that are completely different from each other , it would take me too much to list all of them . 
  campania . 
  they should be tried , they are criminals . 
  that does n't mean that the entire base should be closed for a case or for a non significant number of crimes . 
  the fact that you do n't want them in the country ca n't be related to number of crimes they commit because the number is really really small . 
  it is probably linked to your political views and i do n't think this is the right thread to debate them . 
  we have a movement , mostly composed by the left , that oppose the usa base in vicenza . 
  years ago the massacre at cermis was big in the news and many were mad because the pilots were n't tried in italy , but it was correct to try them in the states . 
  they were convicted of `` minor '' things , whilst italians wanted them convicted for manslaughter . 
  i have no idea which was the correct decision . 
  sometimes there are some news about us soldiers doing something illegal , i remember one in naples where an italian girl was assaulted by a female soldier for something love related and the soldier was just quickly transfered to avoid charge , but there are so few instances that they usually do n't make the news .
