  the only other cause to cover up the statue was because the prince would be offended by it . 
  however , palazzo vecchio is full of nudes and dicks . 
  if he was offended by that statue , he would have been offened by everything , and our pm would have just invited him to visit another location . 
  i 'll say it again : lots of people did n't like that scuplture in palazzo vecchio . 
  some did n't like it because it 's too modern , some because it 's not well positioned , some just did n't like it , some think that palazzo vecchio was fine as it was . 
  there 's been a small internet shitstorm about it . 
  our pm was born of florence and is the ex-mayor , and probably was of the same opinion of the locals , or maybe he just wanted to show the prince the original palazzo vecchio without modern scupltures . 
  i 'm just saying it 's utterly ridicouls to think he did it to not offend his guest : palazzo vecchio is full of nudes . 
  look , have you ever been to palazzo vecchio ? 
  it 's full of frescos and statues with exposed dicks , breasts and butts . 
  it 's litterally full of it . 
  examples : [ 1 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/firenze.palvecchio.500.michelangelo2.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/palazzovecchio-florence.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/battagliadicascina.jpg ) [ 4 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/angelo_bronzino_015.jpg ) they would have had to cover up the entire place ffs ( spoiler : they did n't ) . 
  also , lots of locals were opposed to those scupltures being exposed in the town hall of florence , our pm was probably of the same opinion and prefered to hide them to show the prince the `` original '' palazzo vecchio . 
  btw , i think that if you said that jeff koons scupltures are clearly part of italian culture you 'd get books thrown at you . 
  palazzo vecchio is not a simple museum . 
  it 's florence 's town hall and an enormous building full of frescos from 1500 . 
  lots of locals really do not like those modern sculptures in there , since they are n't in touch with the building . 
  most probably our pm was of the same opinion and decided to hide them to show the prince the `` original '' palazzo vecchio . 
  by the way , palazzo vecchio is full of statues and frescoes of nudes . 
  a few examples : [ 1 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/firenze.palvecchio.500.michelangelo2.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/palazzovecchio-florence.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/battagliadicascina.jpg ) [ 4 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/angelo_bronzino_015.jpg ) they would have had to cover the entire place !, 
  it 's a temporary exposition that is going to last 2 months . 
  it 's a statue crafted by jeff koons based on a greco-roman statue . 
  the statue that was covered was this one http://www.jeffkoons.com/sites/default/files/styles/380x_height/public/artwork-images/gaz4_sm.jpg?itok=9qv76wk5 and it was crafted in 2013, 
  it 's a temporary exposition that will last from october to late december . 
  to be fair , i heard that a lot of fiorentini are n't that happy with this exposition . 
  the statue was crafted two years ago by an american artist , i would n't call it `` heritage '' . 
  a `` beatiful pie e of history '' , `` symbol of a nation 's rich culture '' ffs , it 's a statue crafted in 2013 by an american artist . 
   next the pope will release a pop-rock album he 's already doing that : http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-francis-album-to-be-released-in-november  a new cd combining the speeches of pope francis with different styles of music will be released on 27 november . 
  the album is called wake up ! , and will bring together excerpts of speeches in different languages with music ranging from gregorian chant to rock-n-roll . 
  our election laws are more important for the stability of our country . 
  making one of our chambers almost useless and filling it with ( probably corrupt ) local representatives is not going to help much . 
  rome 's tap water is very good and the city is full of water fountains . 
  at the coliseum there even is a fountain of natural or carbonated tap water where you can get 1l for just 5 cents , but it is a pretty recent addition . 
  when you are visiting historical italian cities the trick is to buy one or two small water bottles from supermarkets ( whre they cost like 30 cents each ) and then refill them at the public fountains . 
  i live in another region but have checked the local news from urbino . 
  no serious damages to buildings or people , but a lot of fear since the quake was so strong that even goods fell of the supermakets ' shelves . 
  a very small amount of rubble fell from the duomo and now it is being inspected to ser if there are any non visible structural damages , but that 's it . 
  italy barely has any oil and there is pretty much no fracking activity not only in the whole country , but even in its neighbours . 
  yeah , we were late to gay marriage because we missed that train during the 2000s . 
  pretty embarassing . 
  from what i understood , getting an abortion in the uk is not that hard for irish women , and that 's why some people just do n't care about an abortion referendum in ireland . 
  an astoundishing high number of women get an abort overseas , so some people just think `` whatever , go overseas , who cares , sucks to be you '' . 
  the catholic church has recently been opening up towards gay marriage but it is never going to condone abortion . 
  not this century , at least . 
  italy managed to pass its abortion laws during the 70s , when there was a huge amount of class warfare and political protest that pushed towards its legalization in most of europe , and we managed to board that train . 
  women that wanted an abortion also counld ' t travel abroad that easily , so everyone was pretty pissed . 
  italy , despite being a catholic country just like ireland , had a very big communist party that managed to hinder or at least slow down the influence of the church , or we would probably be in a far worse state than ireland . 
  last point : a referendum has to be planned very carefully . 
  if it fails , you ca n't just propose another one a few years later . 
  activists are probably waiting for the right moment to hold the referendum to be absolutely sure it wo n't fail . 
   there are 500 types of clothes . 
  i can only wear 3 ... um ... 
  is n't the french government the one trying to ban actual clothes on the beach ? 
  and there are n't that many clothes you can wear on a beach , there is the one showing your ass , the one showing your belly , and burkinis . 
  you do not want to show your legs or belly ? 
  get out of my beach you degenerate !, 
  by the way , i think there are quite a lot of clothes that can be worn by muslim women ... they just need to cover their body and wear a hood/scarf , i think there are a lot of clothes like that . 
  this is so stupid , if someone is forcing her to wear it , then it 's domestic violence and forbidding it will only stop her from going to the beach , since an abusive husband would not allow it . 
  even in case of abuse it would solve nothing . 
  and following your example , maybe we should force fedd alcoholics and pork to muslims , maybe they are being forced to not eat them . 
  on the other hand a cartoon is not that big of a deal , but a government that is actively becoming an enemy of your religion is something that would make most people worried and angry . 
  just look at this thread , many people are saying that it is `` all about sensing a message '' that their religion is n't welcome in the country where most of them were born . 
  this is just going to boost radicalism , which will bring to more violence . 
  i suppose they could give hin a refund and tell him to get a shower . 
  i 'm late to the party , but really , have you guys actually read the article ? 
  those business are pure theft , they have outrageously high prices with no competion since those concessions are hereditary : do you think that 's a good thing ? 
  it 's about fucking time those concessions should be put on sale again . 
  this is exactly why a lot of italians are pro-eu : the union is at least able to force our government to fight against corruption and monopolies . 
  in hereditary hands ? 
  the beach business is owned by thieves that throw outrageous prices just because they can . 
  competition is absolutely welcome . 
  do you really think that all american men are burly bearded dirty ranchers ? 
  do you think that all american women care about your ranch ? 
  a lot of men like tomboysh girls , a lot of women like scrawny clean shaved men . 
  different people different tastes , do n't delude yourself , that guy would be pretty busy in the us too . 
  sure , he could use a gym membership , but he 's clearly attractive . 
   sorry , but if that 's what you guys consider a `` man '' in europe , it makes all the more sense why you guys get pushed around so easily . 
  if i was as racist as you , i would answer : if you are what americans consider a `` man '' , then it makes sense why you guys are known to be insecure , aggressive and prone to dick measuring contest . 
  they would n't have failed a country so important , and even if they had failed , they would n't have failed it so badly . 
  this is the worst coup i 've ever seen in a country if incredible importance . 
  no way the cia could be involved in this . 
  if the us wanted to use their superpower wight to support the coup they would have succeded . 
  berlusconi was a horrible administrator , the crisis was jut the icing in the cake . 
  he has been at the government since ' 94 , the financial crisis hit us so hard thanks to his ( though the opposition was n't much better ) disastrous policies . 
  he is corrupt while being richer than truml . 
  rich people can still be corrupted . 
  you really think that electing a nationalist lobbyist billionaire is a good move ? 
  he 's just gon na get richer while stroking his and his electors ' ego . 
  2 - berlusconi is a business man too . 
  his business went very well , his country on the other hand ... 3 - was n't he a lobbyist ? 
  he may not be corrupt but he 's a corruptor . 
  4 - his policies are vague and ever changing , except for populism and nationalism . 
   there are a shit load of stupid people with degrees especially in the over saturated degree loan market . 
  30 % of the `` degree '' holding voters voted to leave . 
  are they all also stupid ? 
  stupid = / = uneducated . 
  people with lower or no degrees are usually less politically educated and informed . 
   the people that voted in 74 to join the eu and have lived in it for 40 years have seen a decline in their living standards . 
  and a rise in sea levels . 
  correlation does n't imply causation .
