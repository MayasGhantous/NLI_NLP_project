  i agree , but i still do n't get the calais situation . 
  why do they want to escape france so badly ? 
  then it 's the most rational move for them . 
  i wonder why all those refugees sleeping on the streets and park benches in italy ( because all the refugee centers are full ) do n't start walking toward germany . 
  so they are going to walk into germany and nobody can stop them ( short of recurring to violence ) . 
  but what then ? 
  is germany going to accommodate them in houses/apartments ( as opposed to refugee camps ) and provide them with a monthly allowance ? 
  what do they expect to find there ? 
  i do n't buy it . 
  many refugees in calais do n't seem to be very proficient at english . 
  and even if they were , what 's the point of risking your life ( on the highway , or by walking in the eurotunnel ) just in order to get from france to britain ? 
  is n't france safe and developed enough ? 
  in the meantime [ italy is sending its immigrants to germany ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3218327/on-board-refugee-express-mailonline-joins-thousands-migrants-crossing-europe-railways-start-new-life-germany-watch-chelsea-play-football-uk.html ) . 
  it 's a win-win solution . 
  [ google-translated version ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ilgiornale.it%2fnews%2fpolitica%2fbuoni-pasto-agli-immigrati-usati-pagare-prostitute-1164099.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  another downvoter here . 
  op comes across as an intolerant , insufferable asshole . 
  that 's reason enough . 
  like [ this ?

  til we have a muslim mayor . 
   is n't this statement alone a proclamation that he 's a expecting people 's votes as a reward for his actions ? 
  even he ca n't be so delusional . 
  he 's losing ground because of the immigration issue , and he knows it . 
  but he needs the support of the catholic church , and he made this speech at a conference of ultra-conservative catholics . 
  so i think he 's answering to the criticism of the bishop that accused him a few weeks ago of `` not doing enough '' on immigration . 
  there are n't even shelters for everybody . 
  many immigrants in italy just live in the woods . 
  volunteers bring them something to eat . 
  exactly , notoriously war-torn senegal and bangladesh ... 
  newsflash : italy won wwi . 
  it 's the reason why bolzano , trento , and trieste are in italy . 
  i think the only remain of etruscan architecture ( besides the necropolis of course ) is the [ arch of volterra ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/porta_all%27arco ) . 
   i 've been wondering how a bbq place would fare in italy bbq in italy is called '' [ grigliata ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=grigliata&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=947&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cayq_auoawovchmi-ynb8tvbxwivrrkuch1jpakk ) '' . 
  there 's no lack of places where you can have a grigliata in italy . 
  moreover , many people love to barbecue and it 's a popular way of spending time with family and friends . 
  i 'm a lega voter , of course . 
  what kind of point you think you made ? 
  you leftists always criticize lega when it says that moderate muslims should distanced from extremist positions , but i guess your logic is one-way only . 
  lega nord never called kyenge a monkey . 
  calderoli did . 
  hardly controversial in your circles maybe . 
  racism is a serious issue and labeling a mainstream political party as such is offensive to its voters , besides emptying the word of its meaning . 
  anti-uncontrolled immigration would be a better description of lega nord . 
   music to the racist northern league 's ears editorializing titles inserting your own personal opinion is bad journalism . 
   speak for yourself . 
  i have not agreed to anything that legally obligates me to help anyone else but you elected the current italian government , that is carrying out this ferry-boat policy , so the italian people clearly agree on this ... wait a minute !, 
  yeah , the government believes it 's cheaper than building new prisons . 
  thankfully they did n't visit [ italy 's overcrowded prisons ] ( https://emilioquintieri.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/carceri-cella-affollata.jpg ) . 
  itt : kids whose knowledge of history ends at `` 300 '' . 
  berlusconi was the one who did the deal , and he opposed the bombings , at least initially . 
  good . 
  the newspapers say some of the locals tried to return fire with their handguns , without hitting the shooter . 
  mexico 's economy is half the size of italy . 
  both provence and corsica returned to france after wwii . 
  i was asking about permanent gains of land as a consequence of a lost war , as the other user implied . 
  illegal immigrants wo n't do shit , the mafia will keep them under control in the south , since they are a source of revenues ( most companies that receive public money to house and feed them are controlled by the mafia ) . 
  in the rest of italy people [ are not so sensitive to cries of racism ] ( http://europe.newsweek.com/immigrant-surge-brings-out-italys-dark-side-335064?rm=eu ) as they may be in other european countries . 
  all authoritarian regimes see guns in the hand of private citizens as a threat , because they essentially distrust their own citizens . 
  on the other hand , citizens distrust the regime and prefer not to register their weapon , because they fear they will be confiscated . 
  a modern democracy should not fear its own citizens . 
  who cares about what americans miss ? 
  i was talking about europe . 
  i think that our strict gun laws do n't make us safer , and [ tightening them ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-15-6110_en.htm ) is just a pr move that will affect law-abiding gun owners , leaving criminals and terrorists untouched . 
  and how did our strict gun control laws prevent terrorists to get those guns ? 
  if guns are restricted , they should n't be available to anyone , criminals included . 
  my point is that gun control in europe is aiming at the wrong target , i.e. 
  law-abiding citizens , and not terrorists . 
  will the [ new proposed gun directive ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-15-6110_en.htm ) make us safer ? 
  i highly doubt it . 
  i do n't know where you live , but in italy break-ins are not peaceful at all and criminals are armed . 
  that 's why i keep a handgun at home for self defense . 
  i was thinking of the terrorists : what good strict gun laws do if they do n't prevent terrorists from getting assault rifles ? 
  what is the point of [ tightening those rules ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-15-6110_en.htm ) after the attacks then ? 
  i keep a handgun at home [ to protect my family ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4645228.stm ) . 
  and yet common criminals and terrorists are armed to the teeth , despite our progressive gun laws . 
  i 'm glad a live in a country [ with some common sense ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4645228.stm ) in terms of gun laws . 
  they are useless then . 
  sorry to break the circlejerk , but did everyone forget about the 2015 mass shootings in paris ? 
  how did strict gun control help preventing the death of 130 people in november and 11 in january ? 
  and what about the thalys train attack ? 
  oh yes , [ we ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oraq4plkezs ) have [ safety ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w9isssmb_u ) ... 
  i 'm relieved , i was really worried that all those illegal immigrants we ferry from libya would have remained in italy . 
  germany , are you ready for another hot , long summer ? 
  for those old enough to remember : where were you that day ? 
  i was out camping ( boy scout ) , i remember it was a beautiful starry night and when i went home i got the news . 
  we did n't eat fresh vegetables and mushrooms for several weeks , and every day on tv the government announced the level of radioactivity ( that 's when i learned the word `` nanocurie '' ) . 
  maybe people drive like that where you live , but not certainly in northern italy . 
  romanians and albanians seem mainly employed in manual jobs ( the guy who fixed my air conditioner last summer was romanian , for example ) , and so are serbians and bosniacs ... but we also have many students from romania and albania in our universities . 
  albanians were stereotypically depicted as pimps and drug dealers when they first arrived in the '90s , but their image has improved over the years . 
  romanians suffer from the stereotype of being violent criminals , mainly because of a few criminal gangs that travel to italy to commit robberies ( sometimes with fatal consequences ) and then get back to romania , but i think that most romanians living here are actually honest , well integrated persons . 
  there are n't many moroccans in my area , so i could n't say what they do . 
  i do n't have any hard data , but i do n't seem to notice any significant amount of romanian , albanian , or moroccan entrepreneurs in italy . 
  the very fact that they are allowed to gain citizenship is an error . 
  being born in europe does not one a european make . 
  well , their parents did immigrate to europe , right ? 
  if they did n't , their murderous offspring would n't have killed so many innocents . 
  no idea . 
  for me europe is place where i go when i cross the alps . 
   10 years from now , europe is going to be hermetically sealed .
