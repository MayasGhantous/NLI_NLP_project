  i went back to 1763 thanks to the parish registers . 
  nothing really worth mentioning , just fishermen and farmers , but one of them was nicknamed `` bruttotempo '' or `` bad weather '' , maybe he had a temper ? 
  also , in an age when most of the villagers died in their '40s or '50s , all my ancestors lived well into their '80s . 
  i hope i have inherited their good genes ... on my grandfather 's side , i only managed to get back to 1845 : all farmers , all living in the same village , presumably at least since when last names were invented ... 
  would you also ban foreigners from hunting in romania ? 
  it 's one of the biggest hunting destinations for italian hunters , for instance . 
  you wo n't find much sympathy in this sub , people are mostly anti-gun and clueless about their own country 's gun laws . 
  i 've just returned from my usual sunday morning trip to the shooting range , and i own several handguns , rifles , and shotguns . 
  armed self defense is a hot topic right now in italy and the number of civilians owning guns has increased steeply in the last couple of years . 
  the oldest italian text i studied in school dates back to the 9th century : `` sao ko kelle terre , per kelli fini , ke ki kontene ... ecc '' . 
  before dante , there was cielo d'alcamo and the other poets at the court of frederick ii in sicily . 
  and there is clear distinction between latin and italian literature , nobody consider them to be the same . 
  try `` vidkun quisling '' , it sounds norwegian and far-right nationalists might appreciate it . 
  i do n't live in a big city , but they are everywhere . 
  every day , peddlers trying to sell lighters and assorted junk on the street and beggars in the parking lots of grocery stores are all black in my area . 
  i do n't fish . 
  and , although i own several guns , i do n't hunt : it sounds something you learn when you are 14 and grow up in the countryside , and i would n't know where to begin if i wanted to start hunting now . 
  i only shoot paper , clay and steel targets . 
  it sounds like an interesting itinerary that will provide some variety to your trip . 
  i would n't personally spend so much time at disneyland paris , i 'd rather visit the city , but it is a matter of tastes . 
  one full day in genoa will allow you to see the main attractions , but i do n't think you 'll have time for any side trips . 
  monaco is mildly interesting for a stopover , just a couple of hours to visit this playground for the rich . 
  there are certainly many other places we could suggest ( e.g. 
  prague , venice , munich ... ) , but you ca n't see them all in one trip . 
  i already did !, 
  and i had many great craft beers ... 
  usa . 
  colorado , to be specific , i love the nature there , the snowy winters and the mountains . 
  i own 8 guns , i shoot them regularly . 
  travelling for business under the visa waiver program is perfectly legal : https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-visitors-business/wb-temporary-business-visitor-under-visa-waiver-program, 
  it 's italy 's most important commercial harbour , however , surpassing genoa in terms of quantity of goods moved . 
  who cares ? 
  reddit bubble confirmed . 
  that 's not really politically correct to say . 
  i would choose to see the better of the two . 
  given that the talent pool , and the financial resources , are infinitely larger for american productions than for italian movies , it is highly likely that the number of good movies coming out of hollywood surpasses the number of good movies produced in italy . 
  however , there are excellent movies and tv series produced in europe and elsewhere . 
  when i choose what to watch , i value quality over country of origin . 
  you probably do not realize the firepower of hollywood and american television : it is simply not comparable to anything else in the world in terms of its cultural influence . 
  you are factually wrong in your assumptions about the genetic history of italy . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_history_of_italy in any case , that is not my point . 
  i 'm not arguing about the genetic make up of european nations 2,000 years ago . 
  ethnicity is a social construct that humankind uses to differentiate `` us '' from `` them '' , and over which europeans have killed each others for millennia . 
  in a few generations i 'll be dead and the ethnic composition of my country wo n't bother me that much . 
  today however the concept matters , socially and politically . 
   not sure what the italians called that area . 
  from north to south : venezia giulia , istria and dalmazia . 
  genetically , you 're right . 
  socially , ethnicity is very real . 
  you greatly underestimate the role of ancestry and ethnicity in europe . 
  most europeans are old enough to remember the balkan wars , where ethnicity played a dramatically important role . 
  i consider my relatives in germany , australia , france and the united states italians even if they do not speak italian any more . 
  i do not consider italians those who are n't ethnic italians , even if they were born here . 
  i use cash every day and i always keep $ 100-150 in my wallet . 
  i noticed that many shopkeepers say `` lei '' to italian customers , but `` tu '' to african and asian immigrants . 
  til i must be a respectable member of the society , since shopkeepers and bartenders address me with `` lei '' . 
  `` voi '' is still pretty much alive in the south . 
  islamic immigration . 
  there are several , this is probably the most common `` conta '' , a children 's rhyme used when choosing who has to start in tag or hide-and-seek or similar . 
  * ambarab\u00e0 cicc\u00ec cocc\u00f2 * / no meaning , some say it 's a distorted latin sentence , meaning this rhyme could be ancient . 
  * tre civette sul com\u00f2 * / three owls on the dresser * che facevano l'amore * / who were making love * con la figlia del dottore * ; / with the doctor 's daughter * il dottore si ammal\u00f2 : * / the doctor fell ill * ambarab\u00e0 cicc\u00ec cocc\u00f2 !, 
  * there are several variants and many other rhymes used regionally . 
  it is also a national holiday . 
  yes , in [ friuli ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friuli ) we have [ pignarul ] ( http://ilpiccolo.gelocal.it/polopoly_fs/1.10622727!/httpimage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/gallery_978/image.jpg ) , a big bonfire on the eve of january 6th . 
  it is said to date back to ancient pagan traditions . 
  you could say i 'm well read , 
  yeah i live near the border and i want to learn the language of my neighbors . 
  people in slovenia were flabbergasted when i told them i was studying slovenian . 
  ( who am i kidding ... 
  i keep regressing instead of progressing with my slovenian , it 's damn hard ) . 
  `` do you have cars in italy ? '', 
  yes , there are similarities , but i do n't claim i can speak catalan . 
  i can get the sense of what i 'm reading , though . 
  i 'm a native speaker of [ friulan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friulian_language ) ( my local language ) and italian . 
  i 'm fluent in english , and i have a working knowledge of german and slovenian . 
  i can understand most variants of the venetian dialect and i speak the variety used in trieste . 
  i also studied latin and ancient greek in school , but of course i do n't speak those languages . 
  grotto , al fresco , scenario , allegro , piano , fiasco , soprano ( the singer , not the tv mobsters ) , coloratura ( in music ) , opera , libretto ( of an opera ) ... 
  many slovenians do the same . 
  deal . 
  south tyrol was a part of austria that was annexed to italy after wwi , because italy wanted all the alps to form a defensible border after the victory in the war . 
  the majority of the population ( outside bozen ) speaks german ( and the local german dialect ) as a first language , but there is also a minority of ladin speakers , a neolatin language that developed independently from latin . 
  when south tyrolean speak italian they have a noticeable german accent , and they have strong cultural connections with the rest of tyrol and austria : many choose to study at universities in innsbruck or vienna , for example . 
  the region , along with the italian-speaking trentino , enjoys considerable autonomy . 
  it 's my favorite vacation destination , for skiing and hiking . 
  only societies that produced a surplus you could tax were worth conquering . 
  subsistence-level economies could n't be taxed without creating famine and revolts , so the aim was containing the picts and preventing raids , not conquering their land . 
  maybe all those weapons were thrown in a bog * because * they were valuable , as a sacrifice . 
  if i called my teacher `` prof. '' instead of `` professore '' in high school i would have been in deep trouble . 
  i like automatic transmission too , it 's way better than manual when you are sitting in the traffic . 
  too bad it 's also more expensive . 
  i noticed that americans too move their hands while they talk . 
  do you move your hands like the people in this video ? 
  because i do n't . 
  you know what i mean . 
  the south of italy , the mezzogiorno , the meridione . 
  personally , i do n't gesticulate at all ; i did n't realize it until a swedish colleague of mine pointed it out , with a bit of surprise . 
  the italians gesticulating thing . 
  i mean , we are not * all * from the south !, 
  thank you , captain obvious .
