  modern romans are indeed often proud of their past . 
  ah , a fellow connoisseur of the fine arts !, 
  sorry , i replied to the wrong comment . 
  maybe he is the one who should travel more . 
  and what country is it ? 
  we have guns for self defense too : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4645228.stm, 
  [ at least once a week . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hcxn2u3.jpg ) i shoot handguns , rifles , and shotguns . 
  the government is broke and they can not afford replacements . 
  my current driving license was issued in 1987 , i 've got a few stickers on it already . 
  this is the document all people living on the border with yugoslavia used to get , it allowed us to use border crossings reserved for the locals ( i.e. , shorter lines ) . 
  i still have my old [ prepustnica ] ( http://fabioturel.nova100.ilsole24ore.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/imported/prepustnica.jpg ) somewhere !, 
  and my driving license is still paper too . 
  well , another swede commenting above found it odd that id have addresses in the us , i found it weird that they have n't in sweden . 
  small differences . 
  i have no idea why it is required by law in italy to have your address printed on your driving license ( we get a sticker to apply to the license each time we move , even within the same town ) , but we are used to laws without any connection with logic or reality in italy . 
  weird , adresses are mandatory on italian id cards and driving licenses . 
  moreover , the driving license is the only id that gets updated when you move . 
  we have an id card [ like this ] ( http://www.repstatic.it/content/localirep/img/rep-milano/2014/07/03/154350854-401bae57-4b37-4048-a902-49786f7d9f85.jpg ) ( yes , it 's paper , not plastic ) . 
  the front looks like [ this . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/b/b8/carta_identita_fronte.png ) sporadically people would get a [ plastic card like this . 
  ] ( http://www.informatrieste.eu/articoli/fp-content/images/carta_identita_elettronica_triestina.jpg ) i 'll stick with the paper card till 2026 at least , since mine was just issued this year . 
  you can also use a passport , a driving license , or a firearm license as an id . 
  you are required to carry some form of id with you all the time . 
  you do n't have your home address on your id and driving license ? 
  a [ panino ] ( https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/panino-con-salame-8393562.jpg ) . 
  people living near borders do so routinely ( i buy gas and groceries in slovenia , for example ) . 
  others do not , italy is too long . 
  that 's why many go elsewhere if they need expensive treatments , for example croatia or hungary . 
  my parents went to spain , for instance , and saved $ $ $ . 
  as far as i know it 's the norm where i live ( north-east ) , we do n't have a special dinner on 24th . 
  i read that in the south they prefer to have dinner on 24th , while in the north lunch on 25th is more prevalent . 
  in our family we 've never celebrated christmas on dec. 24th : the family meal is on christmas day at lunch . 
  about 500 years old , it 's a big stone house , with thick walls and iron bars at the windows , probably used to be a military post or a prison . 
  it does n't have any historical or artistic value . 
  about $ 200 . 
  it 's the norm for me . 
  you ca n't ? 
  two : they are both professional soldiers who were in iraq and afghanistan , among other missions ( lebanon , kosovo ... ) . 
  one was involved in the [ battle of the bridges ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzmt7r65xuw ) in nasiriyah , iraq . 
  it 's a wonder to behold . 
  note to self : move to austria . 
  my opinion has changed favorably . 
  this is not something you 're going to hear on reddit , but reddit is not representative of the real world , no more than the polls were representative of the us presidential elections . 
  same here . 
  some are . 
  violent armed burglars , who often hurt and sometimes kill their victims , are not rare in italy . 
  europe is more diverse than you might think : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4645228.stm, 
  well , i hope i will never need to use a gun for self defense , because of the moral , legal , and financial consequences it would entail . 
  the guns are there , however , just in case . 
  there 's no way in hell i 'm going to leave my guns , that cost me thousands of euros in total , at a shooting range . 
  most ranges would n't have enough storing room in any case . 
  moreover , armed home defense is legal in italy , so my guns are going to stay where they are . 
  we shoot in europe too , although it 's not as popular as in the us . 
  i regularly hit the [ shooting range ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hcxn2u3.jpg ) , i own handguns and rifles and shotguns . 
  i love it . 
  i 'd just add that it is becoming the most important holiday of the year for children and pre-teens , so it is likely that in the future , when these kids grow up , halloween will become more widespread in italy . 
  the number of children knocking at my door for candies increases every year . 
  i lived in nyc for a year in the '90s . 
  best year of my life , but it 's a tough place to live in , and you tend to become tough as well . 
  after a while , you do n't care about others , you do n't care if the homeless lying on the sidewalk is dead or sleeping , you just move on , you have more pressing matters . 
  you need to get to your destination five minutes before it is humanly possible . 
  all this tension takes a toll on you . 
  german is important for tourism in some places in northern italy ( lake garda , sea resorts on the adriatic ) , and shopkeepers and bartenders there tend to speak it . 
  yes .

  i think it is a basic human right . 
  i 'm not religious , but i have a cross on a wall i bought in mexico as a souvenir . 
  same in italy ... and in every courtroom !, 
  denver , colorado, 
  when i 'm in the us my roaming charges are horribly expensive , i could pay $ 3 a day just for sending you a text message . 
  on the other hand , whatsapp messaging is free , if i can find a wi-fi network . 
  any good american beer will do , since they are n't well known in italy and are likely to be appreciated by your guests . 
  sam adams comes to mind , but also fat tire ( new belgium brewery ) , if it 's available in your area . 
  there is no minimum wage in italy . 
  even if gas prices are high , we tend to drive a lot . 
  over the years , i took road trips to denmark , the netherlands , germany , austria , croatia , slovakia , czech republic , switzerland ... but i fly when my vacation is limited to one large city ( i.e. , london or paris or barcelona ) . 
  i also fly and rent a car when i want to tour the place ( andalucia , sicily , crete ... ) . 
  i use the train for short trips to places that are closer to me ( florence , rome , venice ... ) . 
  haha , i did n't know you had `` italian lifestyle '' people in austria !, 
  on the other hand , if we have a few gentlemen wearing loden and feathered hats here , it only makes sense . 
  aperol spritz is probablly the most popular cocktail in italy , but here it 's made with aperol liquor and prosecco . 
  as chain restaurants , we also have roadhouse grill ( steakhouse ) and america graffiti ( '50s diner ) . 
  seeing a specialist requires long waiting times ( several weeks at least ) and costs $ 30-40 . 
  seeing the very same specialist privately takes a couple of days and costs $ 90-130 , and you get to be treated as a human being and not as a nuisance . 
  those who can afford it opt for private healthcare , but serious surgery and emergencies are always performed by the national healthcare system , because those activities are generally not profitable for private clinics . 
  you should always sit on your towel , never on the bench . 
  not in italy . 
  it would be considered rude requiring your guests to take off their shoes . 
  you endure it and clean afterwards . 
  some cities have large communal trash bins that get emptied periodically . 
  they are unsightly in my opinion , but i think that door-to-door garbage collection is n't practical in larger cities . 
  who are you to tell me what i am or i am not ? 
  friuli 's identity is clearly defined by history , geography , and language . 
  your ignorance is no excuse for dismissing it . 
  yes , but it is not mandatory . 
  if you think that friuli is a patchwork you clearly have n't done your homework . 
  but wait , were you talking about friuli venezia giulia ? 
  because typically you italians can not tell the difference between the two . 
  before tax ?
