according to [ repubblica ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2016/11/11/news/prodi_renzi_bandiera_ue-151827934/?ref=hrec1-2 ) they say palazzo chigi denied this . 
  well the only way to find out is to have a referendum is n't it ? 
  however , if we have to go by rabid facebook commenters , i have noticed a trend reversal . 
  i am starting to find very often people who are critical of what m5s have done , where before this was much rarer . 
  perhaps , since we now have had the time to see what they are capable of , people are starting to realise their empty promises . 
  you can even find the rare person * brave enough * to say that they will be voting yes to the referendum , in facebook posts from ifq !, 
   renzi definitely knows better than you , it seems . 
  come on , i would n't read too much into this gesture . 
  i do n't think he now suddenly wants to * make italy great again * by leaving the eu , especially when there 's a much better low-hanging fruit , and that is taking the uk 's place , in terms of power , * within * the eu . 
  whoever gets 50 % + 1 of the votes wins ? 
  what 's so wrong and unfathomable about that ? 
  [ mildly nsfw ] ( http://www.wordreference.com/iten/figa ), 
  the point is that your statement is hardly defensible . 
  what do you base your opinion that eu flags are not popular enough ? 
  if you understand italian , have a look at this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-us2e7ha9n4 ) . 
  it is an interview of random passers-by a few days after the brexit vote , by a `` populist '' newspaper ( `` il fatto quotidiano '' , the mouthpiece of the m5s ) . 
  so yes , it is biased , but at most , it is biased against the eu . 
  if you understand what they say , i would n't say that everyone sees the eu in a bad way . 
  there are some among the interviewed that are quite sad to see you go . 
  because if we have to go by anecdotes , then i could say that wherever i go in italy , i see eu flags everywhere . 
  i see everywhere signage of works funded by the eu . 
  i do n't think the eu flag is not popular , i find it also graphically pleasing from a design perspective . 
  maybe it is my fault because i tend to associate a positive meaning to the eu flag . 
  but i am the sort of guy who went specifically to see the eu buildings while in bruxelles , so yes you and me are not exactly representative  but i would n't bet on italy having an anti-eu sentiment comparable to the brits , you have always been special from that point of view . 
  it looks more like a misprinted mexican flag / s, 
  i think the parliament could change the constitution , then if it fails to secure a 2/3 majority it would need the change to be confirmed through a referendum ( like it 's happening for the 4 dec ref ) . 
  then , another one on the eu . 
  yes it can be done , but it could fail at any of these steps , so that 's why i hope it 's extremely unlikely . 
  if italy leaves , then the eu is toast , it wo n't survive the loss of a founding member . 
  not cool , renzi . 
  says you ? 
  when 's the last time you have been in italy ? 
  of course , it may just be that it is very complicated and thus unlikely to ever happen , especially if it requires modifying the constitution . 
  italy can not kick itself out though . 
  at least , it is not so easy as for the british . 
  we can not have a referendum on our membership of the eu as the constitution forbids it . 
  i am not really sure how it would be constitutionally legal for italy to leave the eu . 
  well he said he wo n't stand for office , as he has been [ convicted of manslaughter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beppe_grillo#legal_issues ) . 
  someone worse from his party might be elected , like di maio or di battista . 
  but ... muh german cars and french wine !, 
  well , switzerland thought the same , but afaik , the nazis decided to just postpone its invasion after having dealt with the rest of the major powers . 
  in the unlikely event that russia arrives at spain 's doorstep , i do n't think they would remain independent for very long . 
  well , if it is a professional army i do n't see why soldiers would refuse . 
  after all , international forces are already being deployed far away from their soldiers . 
  the fundamental idea is that `` today it has happened to a far-away country , tomorrow it could be your own , therefore we must always be vigilant . '', 
  further , at least at the beginning , i do n't think national armies would disappear . 
  depending on the organisation of this proposed eu army , it could very well be that they find some form of agreement to treat these extra-european territories differently like nato does . 
  a * drafted * army could be different of course , but then again you could apply the same reasoning to a british kid being forced to go fight for the falklands . 
  if finland falls then it 's highly likely it would n't stop there . 
  then yes , we would all need to save europe , lest the same fate befall to other countries . 
  so it 's just envy ? 
  dude , its not the forties anymore . 
  i 'm pretty sure it would be a professional army . 
  as for your second point , if europe falls your country will likely be next . 
  i am `` looking forward '' to see trump 's reaction to the first terrorist bombing or mass shooting in the us while he 's in office . 
  sadly , it 's not a matter of * if * but of * when * as four years is statistically a long time for these events . 
  but even so , * the great leveller * would take care of him eventually . 
  how old is trump ? 
  neither of the two candidates would have been in a good position age-wise , come re-election . 
  clinton would have been 73 , trump will be 74 . 
  have you ever elected presidents that would have become `` old '' ( ie pretty close to 80 y. 
  while in office ? 
  that is what also did sanders in , imho : the fact that he would have become `` old '' while in office . 
   no i 'm not . 
  do you realize that the right wing , m5s and also a substantial part of pd are against this constitutional change ? 
  it does n't ring a bell to you ? 
  when the right wing and m5s are against something , that thing is usually something good . 
  like the civil unions . 
   it robs the people the right to elect the members of the senato , which we currently have , by creating a system where the new members will be nominated by their fellow politicians , so it creates less democracy . 
  what are you on about ? 
  the new senators will still be voted in by the people . 
  they wo n't just be appointed at random , but will be mayors and regional councillors . 
  they might not be voted by * you * in particular , but they will be voted in by the respective electorate . 
  you 're in spain , you will be the penultimate country to be invaded from a russian total conquest of europe !, 
  initially , there were some hopes of them being a progressive force . 
  after their now-famous streaming video with bersani , they revealed their true populist roots . 
  they have all sorts of people , even outright fascists . 
  their leader just came out in [ support of trump ] ( http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2016/11/09/grillo-compares-m5s-to-trump_4ee2a2d7-a688-41e2-81f0-323882e55750.html ) . 
  * of course . 
  well we are officially in a dystopian timeline now . 
  in [ the difference engine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_difference_engine ) by gibson there are american refugees due to a balkanised usa . 
  have you read 11.22.63 by stephen king ? 
  in the book [ spoiler ] ( / s `` saving jfk leads to a dystopian timeline '' ) . 
  what if only trump can save the world ?!, 
  * please do n't let this become a dystopian timeline ... * * please do n't let this become a dystopian timeline ... * * please do n't let this become a dystopian timeline ... *,

  there 's also a [ live version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alqa-zqlj-a ) !,

  but is n't their population bigger than ( some of ? ), 
  the other countries ? 
  we could organise an * air corridor * towards the `` free city of london '' . 
  * search your feelings , you know it to be true !, 
  of course , but if labour votes for brexit , the remaining 63 % will feel disenfranchised and betrayed . 
  i would have thought that the majority of labour voters would be pro-europe . 
  they do n't because in italy you can not have a referendum on foreign policy treaties . 
  they 'd have to change the constitution and the likelihood of that happening is extremely small . 
  at most they want to get out of the euro , but it 's a fringe movement within m5s . 
  the italian referendum has nothing to do with europe . 
  i do not agree .
