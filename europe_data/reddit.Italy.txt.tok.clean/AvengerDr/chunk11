  however , more to the point , there is no proof ( other than the gospels ) that he actually performed any miracle . 
  a jesus might have existed , but of course there is zero chance that he had any supernatural powers . 
  that 's similar to how the catholic church counts believers in italy . 
  some people baptise their newborns not because they are really christian believers , just out of tradition and to not miss the celebrations/gifts that come with it . 
  clearly newborns are in no position to be asked their opinion . 
  then , for the vatican , you are a christian forever , unless you initiate a complex procedure to de-baptise yourself . 
  source : i 'm an italian atheist who was baptised , took communion and then stopped . 
  my parents are agnostic ( or do n't really care ) but they never saw any ulterior motives in the rite , besides the celebration itself . 
  they mean the `` crusaders '' , the `` christians '' . 
  romans because the catholic church is based in the vatican . 
  true romans would have simply absorbed allah in their pantheon to shut them up . . 
  so when they said that 80 million turks could come to the uk , you really believed every single one would move ? 
  if they stay , after brexit they will be out regardless . 
  speak for yourself !, 
  :d where would we be without olive oil ... 
  * surrendered * to the germans ... come on , get a life . 
  that is also open to debate . 
  * eurasia * , more like . 
  there is always milan , the italian financial centre . 
  you ca n't say it 's a dull city . 
  i recall reading that the italian govt sent an exploratory mission to investigate which uk eu agencies might be transferred in italy . 
  if we moved the capitol to rome it could be a much better reborn roman empire :d cue ck2 's `` the borders have been restored '' ... 
   20 pounds ? 
  what are you going to do with 5 pounds ? 
  you can do nothing with 3 pounds ** ftfy ** , 
  so you are saying that we should listen to the ... * experts * ? 
  that 'd be cool !, 
  can you really imagine the eu doing nothing while a member state is invaded ? 
  mussolini did n't get elected pm democratically . 
  he was in parliament , but he seized power through a [ coup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/march_on_rome ) . 
  i guess no news is good news . 
  let 's check back on this one minute after article 50 is invoked . 
  well , if you can imagine a turkey where church and state are completely separate , in a future where islam undergoes an `` enlightenment '' - like movement that reduces its prominence in daily life ... then maybe . 
  the eu promotes civil and social progress . 
  abolishing the death penalty is progress . 
  i once had to send a letter to ireland and the lady at the local post office ( in england ) corrected me by saying `` ah . . * southern * ireland '' . 
  i had never heard of ireland referred to in this way before . 
  in italian we have `` irlanda '' and `` irlanda del nord '' . 
  as gaber might have said if he were english , unfortunately or perhaps fortunately , i am . 
  but i have been living in the uk for the last 5 years , so my perception is altered . 
  i know that numbers are still bad , but the situation from my little corner of italy seems to have * slightly * improved , at least since i graduated in the middle of the financial crisis . 
  while my heart weeps every day because europe does n't speak latin , i agree , i originally moved to england because of the language . 
  but if push comes to shove , i 'd have to learn another language . 
  what am i going to do , not talk to anyone else ever again ? 
  :d i 'd take it as a challenge . 
  well there was no need to get out of europe if you only wanted to not be part of the euro . 
  you already had an opt-out for that . 
  but keep repeating that if it makes you happier , you 've been doing it since before it was born and it 's still here . 
  it 's so bankrupt that it has gained a lot , relatively speaking , on the pound . 
  it 's something i 'm seriously considering . 
  if i can find a university looking for a ( tenured ) vr researcher !, 
  having scotland re-apply would be an excellent opportunity to plant the `` seeds of doom '' ( / s ) in britain by making them adopt the euro !, 
  brexiters disregarded the economic arguments in favour of `` sovereignty '' and `` taking their country back '' . 
  in case of scotland that would actually be true . 
  why would n't it change ? 
  there were lot of [ proposed alternatives ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/16/flag-end-union-jack-scotland-independence ) at the time . 
  since # 3 looks half-italian , i personally propose you go [ full italian ] ( http://www.italiaindependent.com/media/catalog/product/cache/0/image/800x800/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/w/m/wmmx002.041.t_l_01_base_1/www.italiaindependent.com--wmmx002-grey-31.jpg ) -- it 's by an italian designer . 
  perhaps it might be one of many things that will make your stay out of the eu unsustainable . 
  i look forward to the day when you have to exchange pounds for euros once crossed the border :d, 
  yes i understand , but that age-bracket includes very diverse scenarios . 
  if you 're under 18 , in an ideal world , you should be in school , not looking for work . 
  if you 're over 22/23 you might have recently graduated and thus looking for a job that matches your degree . 
  which if i understand it correctly means that if they are grouped together 1 out of 10 is unemployed ( 9.8 % ) . 
  then i stand corrected . 
  it 's hard to explain then . 
  what are they doing then ? 
  i only drove through , never stayed . 
  the italian swiss talk funny  i found out that multilingualism was a lie . 
  tried to ask for directions in english , french , spanish , and italian . 
  nothing . 
  but my sample was just one person ... :d, 
  youth unemployment considers people aged 15-24 . 
  most of them are in school or at university . 
  it does n't surprise me . 
  overall unemployment is at [ 11.7 % ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/economia/2016/05/31/news/istat_disoccupazione-140987761/?ref=search ) . 
  i am not too knowledgeable about the bank situation , but judging from the italian press nobody is panicking . 
  italy is not a small country : if it goes down it will bring with herself half of europe . 
  but from the perspective of a syrian refugee it still is an improvement . 
  it 's not like there are no immigrants in italy . 
  i guess you missed the huge influx in [ the 90s ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/solidarieta/immigrazione/2011/03/06/news/1991_il_primo_grande_esodo_dall_albania_verso_l_italia-13263392/ ) . 
  sorry the links are in italian . 
  i really wonder what brits would say if they saw scenes like that happening to their country . 
  but you know , going to the uk from italy for example ( like in my case ) i do n't feel it being * real * migration . 
  i can be home in a few hours if i so wish . 
  i ~ ~ feel ~ ~ felt it like moving from my italian hometown to another italian city . 
  because ... because it ~ ~ is ~ ~ was all europe right ? 
  if i need to be outside the eu i might as well be outside the eu ** for real ** and consider going to the us/canada ( i am an academic ) . 
  but those migrants in calais are not eu citizens , otherwise they 'd have no problems getting in the uk even now . 
  i was referring to skilled eu citizens that are in the uk for a specific reason . 
  for the others , yes even a country like italy is going to be a massive improvement for them . 
  just for your info , if you look at the average facebook news post in italy , `` everyone '' believes that migrants all want to stay in italy and not go anywhere else . 
  let 's go even further and give britain back to the romans !, 
  caledonians can stay . 
  the uk is not paradise . 
  if one just wants to work and is not desperate they 'll find some other country rather than getting themselves in a fake marriage . 
  what ? 
  the emperor of the greeks maybe . 
  west roman empire best roman empire !, 
  :d constantine was a traitor !, 
  wow there are still pretenders to the napoleonic empire .
