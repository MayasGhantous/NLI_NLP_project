  from his perspective , there would have been lots of events to celebrate . 
  the repeal of the 1972 european communities act , the resignation/dismissal of uk meps , the closing of the border , the first eu repatriations/deportations ( wow just reading it seems something out of a dystopian sci-fi novel ) . 
  why not be there as ukip leader , rather than just `` some guy '' who used to be in politics ? 
  come on miles to km is easy , just multiply by 1.6 and remember that 60mi is ~ = 100km . 
  considering that `` we '' named most of their cities ( and europe 's ) , they just altered them . 
  what was wrong with londinium , mancunium , eboracum , acquae sulis ... ? 
  unfortunately , i 'm afraid it will all go down the drain if m5s wins the next political elections :(, 
  you should compare the total number of eu - { host country } citizens for each country , not just the brits against the rest of the eu . 
  seriously . 
  please undo the great vowel shift !, 
  that is almost exactly italian . 
  just remove some vowels and put some `` u `` s here and there :d i have a romanian collleague but i can never make any sense when she speaks in romanian . 
  but reading it seems to be very easy . 
  i guess you do n't pronounce it as you write it . 
  i 'm italian . 
  italy has never been the `` i '' in the `` pigs '' . 
  that was ireland . 
  some people tried to float the idea of `` piigs '' with italy in it when italy was doing really bad at the time of berlusconi . 
  do n't you think these trade agreements and visa arrangements would end up resembling the eu ? 
  where were you when rome fell ? 
  true that . 
  i learned it the hard way in crusader kings 2 while trying to reform the roman empire . 
  you *** do n't *** want to be stranded in anatolia . 
  that 's the [ gargano ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gargano ) . 
  it 's a natural reserve . 
  there are also various popular touristic towns such as vieste or peschici . 
  the southeastern tip ? 
  that 's the puglia region . 
  the brightest part is bari which , if you ever had to live in the south , is probably the richest city ( not counting napoli or palermo ) with some opportunities even in hitech jobs . 
  then further south you have lecce and the salento which is basically the california or caribbean of italy . 
  where the two tips meet at the top you have taranto , the most polluted and most blade runneresque city in italy . 
  i should probably post a picture ... 
  i wonder what he would do if ni joined the roi and with it , the eu !, 
  that must be some kind of * autobot * or worse , a * decepticon * !, 
   a senate would again push powers up to the european level instead of the national level and that is certaintly what our forefathers died for , state sovereignity . 
  i 'm pretty sure they did n't die for that exact reason . 
  i seem to recall there was something else going on . 
  is this the european version of * muh states rights ? 
  italo is a different company . 
  frecciarossa * s * are by trenitalia . 
  you should try the newer led bulbs . 
  so the new passports will be blue with gold lettering ? 
  * omg secret eussr conspiracy ! 1 *, 
  yeah , sorry i meant * when the kingdom of england and wales joins the euro . 
  indeed , italy has a different side for every coin . 
  monarchies are the laziest . 
  hopefully when britain joins the euro they 'll be a bit more original and do something different than putting charles on every coin . 
  would they ? 
  `` attacking gibraltar '' would n't be a military campaign where spain needs to say `` bomb them into submission '' . 
  i would n't want to be in the shoes of a military commander ordering their soldiers to fire on fellow europeans , regardless of their motives . 
  we can easily solve this situation : it all used to belong to rome anyway !, 
  you mean you have n't colonised the new continent as venice and that manhattan is now known as nova laguna ? 
  sounds like you want to be part of a voluntary union created to facilitate and support all of that !, 
  you can not sell products in the eu that do n't follow their rules . 
  rules that you no longer will have any say in . 
  so leaving a union that lasted for 40 + years is something you do every other day . 
  even more so if you count leaving was a decision reached through lies and falsehoods , on the heels of emotion rather than rational thought . 
  i think it 's more extreme than trump . 
  unless he manages to get himself reelected , trump 's damage can be undone in 2020 . 
  brexit will last far longer than that . 
  they might not be as extreme but leaving the eu * is * an extreme act . 
  100 % would have stayed otherwise . 
  i hope it was not a bianchi , imagine the horror of ruining such an expensive bike ... 
   even if it 's not the economic capital of the eu due to a technicality . 
  til the uk out of the eu is just a * technicality * . 
  the question is why there are different rules or processes in the first place . 
  i do n't know . . maybe `` resident in the uk '' and `` resident abroad/in the rest of the eu '' . 
  are there drafts already of the new euro coins without the uk yet ? 
  do you really believe the uk will maintain the same level of influence outside the eu ? 
   we brits are fellow europeans as well you know . 
  that 's arguable . 
  in the first week of the term in my university there were signs for uk students and `` eu students '' . 
  last time i checked uk students were still eu students . 
  but the british do these kind of things without thinking about it . 
  this could all have been avoided by realising that the only solution was to have britain became a pro-european country . 
  or rather you will be able to realise how much on the wrong side of history you are . 
  * the eu , an elegant institution for a more civilised age . 
  did you mean * arrivederci * ? 
  the new pound coin looks surprisingly similar to the $ 1 coin , apart from it being a dodecagon . 
  * it 's a start . 
  guys . 
  some of us continentals were always hoping that one day you 'd realise that the only answer is more integration and would finally become a pro-european country . 
  i 'm still confident it will happen . 
  i mean brexit has put into motion the road that will take the uk back into europe as a fully committed member . 
  i 'm sure this is not a farewell but a goodbye . 
  well i still prefer an alfa romeo over a bmw or audi !, 
  i have a black cowboy hat that says made in texas , not even usa !, 
  my samsonite cabin luggage has a big * made in eu * lettering on the top , complete with flag . 
  looks very cool !, 
  always a pleasure to drag it along in uk airports !, 
  what ?!, 
  italy is not # 1 in ** this ** at least ? 
  was the sample population a group of victorinox enthusiasts ? 
  * there was a dream that was rome ... *, 
  well yes because we studied it in school . 
  i studied both english , and french . 
  do n't you learn foreign languages in school ? 
  world trade organization . 
  the set of rules that regulate how countries can trade with each other in the absence of a specific trade deal . 
  they have two years starting from the moment she triggers art. 50 .
