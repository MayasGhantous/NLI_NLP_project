  but the bbc just said she might wait until the end of march , after the treaty of rome celebrations . 
  so they would have until march 2019 . 
  if they can find an agreement , then great . 
  otherwise the eu treaties will cease to apply to the uk the day after ( and that means wto rules ) . 
   go to another country where i 'll have to learn the language , get a job , find a place to live etc just fyi , literally everyone who came to the uk had to do that . 
  it 's not impossible . 
  i can picture theresa may going full - [ unlimited power ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cjlbuvl.gif ) if she invokes it tomorrow . 
  juncker looks more like the ineffectual chancellor . . what was his name ? 
  [ this is how liberty dies ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1ffvweqnsm ), 
  `` a cono '' ? 
  conical . 
  the whole building is called a * trullo * . 
  i ` de be happy to have scotland in the eu . 
  i actually hope they can get into the eu as an independent country . 
  living in scotland ( as part of the eu ) is the only way i realistically could see myself going back to live in the ~ ~ uk ~ ~ * island of great britain * once i leave it for northern europe . 
  but please eu , this time *** no exceptions *** . 
  it has to be the euro and schengen . 
  well , they 'd be an english speaking country in the eu , just a few hundred kms up north from where they area already located . 
  * if * they can manage to keep their eu membership or rejoin really soon . 
  ca n't wait for the scottish euros !, 
  a federalising or - ed eu will appeal them more ? 
   is spain or italy having the same problems which leads people to become eurosceptic and vote le pen/wilders ? 
  unfortunately yes , the chance of a m5s win is increasing . 
  unlikely they will be able to form a coalition , unless they ally with salvini . 
  who , strangely enough , has just said he does n't want to leave the eu . 
  damn , does this mean we need to wait for the post-credits scene ? 
  how long does it last ? 
  the # is 1.14 today . 
  what happens if it reaches parity ? 
  if it goes below ? 
  because you can see 10-20-50-100 years in the future ? 
  * search your feelings . 
  you know it to be true . 
  because the boats are usually not safe enough to take the trip back . 
  [ ironically ... ] ( http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/residence/documents-formalities/registering-residence/uk/index_en.htm )  eu citizens are not required to have a registration certificate in order to reside or work in the united kingdom . 
  in the uk you declare your residence by registering to the local council . 
  op seemed to imply that all those who came to the uk were aware of this 85 page form . 
  obligatory * i am guybrush threepwood , and i want to be a pirate !, 
  * quote . 
  because as an eu citizen it was just like moving cities in the same country . 
  no need to do that unless you wanted to become a citizen . 
  you can do it online , but not in every case . 
  for example my gf who lives with me has to apply with the paper form ( she is still studying ) . 
  thy ask us to supply photos of us together , skype logs , etc. 
  to prove our relationship !, 
  i would venture to guess that the invasion of europe would be ... something on a different scale . 
  you 'd still need the rest of europe ( and the world ) to help though . 
  so since we 'd realistically always be in it together , why not make it an official and formal thing ? 
  knowing a language enriches you as a person . 
  plus you get access to that country 's culture . 
  i think we might agree that at least on that perspective , there 's a lot that could be beneficial . 
  what ? 
  nobody in italy thinks that italian is an international language . 
  they had probably not been abroad too much and expected things to be different . 
  i assure you that even if italian comparatively speaking is one of the most spoken languages in europe , nobody is under the assumption that it is an international language . 
  have you tried duolingo ? 
  you wo n't be fluent after that , but it 's something i guess . 
   hell , japan is not what the japanese call japan , yet in german you do n't call it `` nippon . '', 
  in italian it exists as an adjective : `` nipponico / - i '' versus the more common `` giapponese / - i '' . 
  [ no please no !, 
  there 's no supernatural force forbidding you to do it , unlike for example what happens when you 're a mage and want to wear plate mail . 
  but you 're mixing flavours . 
  the salad is cold , pasta should be warm , and the carbonara sauce will mix with the oil or dressing you have on the salad . 
  come on , it 's just one extra dish !, 
   i did n't put cream in the carbonara though . 
  then there 's still hope for you !, 
  in italy you 'd use bread for that . 
  you never eat them together . 
  before or after maybe , but never at the same time . 
  certainly not in the same dish . 
  it 's not mandatory to share one . 
  we have several , i mean they 're a few $ each ... 
   actually , the fact that the uk could vote to leave the eu without a plan in place , but just keep calm and carry on , makes me think that the uk is inherently pretty stable . 
  it make me think they 're just winging it . 
  or perhaps the uk might rejoin the eu in ten years . 
  you ca n't think the separation is going to be eternal !, 
  in a few weeks it 's going to get real , is n't it ? 
  berlusconi 's exit from center-stage politics left a gap on the right that has been filled by m5s . 
  it 's even worse now , because the m5s have gained an almost-fanatical following , under the guise of `` honesty '' and `` representing the common man '' . 
  i 'm now curious about the [ ghost of town of rome in ohio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rome,_morrow_county,_ohio ) . 
  there are [ several romes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rome_ ( disambiguation \\ ) #places ) , you need to be specific . 
  ** edit : **  `` rome was laid out in 1827 by lemuel potter . 
  [ 2 ] the town failed to meet potter 's expectations , as one 19th-century writer remarks `` it did not bear any resemblance to ancient rome '' . 
  that 's why the uk should commit to ** hard remain ** . 
  i mean it 's just delaying the inevitable . 
  are you really sure the uk will stay of the eu forever ? 
  that looks too organised !, 
  are you sure it 's italy ? 
  go to puglia if you want to find more public beaches . 
  when was this placed ? 
  actually , the romans named everything . 
  at the first signs of trouble , they also left rome !, 
  the italian democratic party ( pd ) might split . 
  i fear that might put the populists in power . 
  i hear there is still room in avignon . 
  yes , it 's the typical wide glass for wine . 
  does * chalice * ring a bell ? 
  `` i am italian and i do n't get it . '', 
  probably you pronounce * penne * differently , but i 'm not seeing it . 
   the places that interest me , ca n't be found on streets though  found dr emmett brown !,
