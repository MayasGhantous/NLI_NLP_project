  you 'll have to eat some humble pie , eventually . 
  i think it 's inevitable that the uk will end rejoining the eu . 
  maybe not tomorrow , but someday . 
  it only takes one pro-eu government to do it . 
  watch out for us then :d, 
  the dutch/czech/romanian / german parliaments would have had to jointly approve the invasion beforehand . 
  after that they would comply i guess . 
  di maio , di battista , or the dark lord grillo himself might out-berlusconi him . 
  we have to respond to the german one now :d it was really funny !, 
  what makes you think people would n't change their minds until then ? 
  or rather , what makes you think in 2020 there would still a sufficient number of people in favour of brexit ? 
  maybe there could be a hung parliament , thereby making brexit impossible . 
  how are you going to get in then ? 
  were n't you guys a fan of * prosecco * ? 
  . . and so what ? 
  losing an election or condemning a whole country ? 
  which is the worst option ? 
  that would make them closer to europa !, 
  with 27 members it would take around 13 years to go a full round . 
  unfortunately the italian acronym , * `` fai l'italia grande ancora '' * is a bit nsfw ... 
  well he is not immortal , is he ? 
  ever heard of the `` bible belt '' ? 
  i ca n't see what states like the pacific coast states and the north eastern states have in common with the south and midwest , nowadays . 
   taking part in a decision that all * experts * consider a bad choice . 
  you know the drill . 
  that has been the point since the beginning . 
  why should we be worried ? 
  i can only hope i see it during my lifetime . 
  from : [ an america first energy plan ] ( https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy )  we must take advantage of the estimated $ 50 trillion in untapped shale , oil , and natural gas reserves , especially those on federal lands that the american people own . 
   the trump administration is also committed to clean coal technology , and to reviving america 's coal industry , which has been hurting for too long . 
   president trump will refocus the epa on its essential mission of protecting our air and water . 
  hardly encouraging . 
  no mention of climate change . 
  wow !, 
  that 's the definition of * presidential * right there . 
  he sometimes looks so harmless , and good-humoured . 
  if it was n't for his ideas ... 
  well it 's not sure that he 'll be reelected . 
  surely the americans will realise their mistake ... 
  * right ? 
  even in italy , with the vatican and all just a few meters from the palace , there are no priests involved in the ceremony . 
  there 's just the honor guard of the military . 
  the incumbent pm hands a small bell to the pm-elect ( which signals the beginning of a new legislature ) and that 's it . 
  the guardian posted this :  the old white house climate change page -- https://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/climate-change -- has disappeared like a species . 
  the old url redirects to a generic trump splash . 
  if le pen wins i think the only solution is cryogenic suspension . 
  maybe a set of bonfires a-la lord of the rings ? 
  dammit you 're right . 
  i should think through . 
  talk for yourself . 
  guys i 'm going to be off the net for a bit . 
  can anybody warn me if he launches icbms towards europe ? 
  there 's already a [ campaign song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uu3kceec98 ) !, 
  imagine she 's talking about the eu !, 
  sounds like a knock-off of the chain [ eataly ] ( http://www.eataly.com ) . 
  our lord farage already called sweden 's exit as [ sexit ] ( https://youtu.be/fhlyrsltsrk?t=29s ) . 
  but that is not its real name . 
  it 's how it was `` sold '' to the media . 
  it actually is a bunch of `` legge xxx n. yyy '' and so on . 
  do n't you people in the uk eat food ? 
  you are just making these things become more expensive , people will still need them . 
  that explains it . 
  i do research in vr/hci and in more than ten years i have never seen russian researchers ( from russia ) at any conference . 
  would be great if you engaged more with the international community . 
  ~ ~ you ~ ~ we ~ ~ humans ~ ~ also do n't need to put any fancy kill switch on ~ ~ us ~ ~ any robot . 
  totally unnecessary . 
  ~ ~ you ~ ~ we ~ ~ humans ~ ~ also do n't need to put any fancy kill switch on ~ ~ us ~ ~ any robot . 
  totally unnecessary . 
  i wonder how it must be like being in the mind of an alt-right person . 
  are you american ? 
  the us has a `` single market '' between its 50 states . 
  you are free to buy something sold in california if you live in arizona and not pay any customs duties . 
  you can freely travel ( and move ) from one state to the other without needing to show your passport . 
  if you buy food or any kind of product in one state you will be sure that it follows the same federal regulations . 
  the uk is leaving all of that and will have to discuss its relationship with the eu from scratch . 
  it would be like texas leaving the union and having to renegotiate the rules under which rest of the usa trades with texas , what happens to rusa citizens living in texas , and vice versa . 
  thanks , but no thanks . 
  oh no , who will buy our prosecco now ? 
  christian fundamentalists ? 
  you 'll be amazed to learn that in several countries it 's perfectly acceptable to refer to a small part to mean the whole . 
  england to mean the uk or the other way around : america to mean the us . 
  imagine you had to pay customs duty to buy something sold in california if you lived in arizona . 
  imagine you had to show your passport while driving from one state to another . 
  the uk is going to have to negotiate how that will work . 
  while the uk was in the single market and the eu it all worked close to how it works in the us . 
  it can not . 
  once article 50 is triggered , you have 2 years . 
  after that you are out , deal or no deal . 
  a time will come when people like you will realise the terrible mistake . 
  please try to be more original in choosing the designs for your euro coins . 
  do n't put the king everywhere . 
  at last the uk will finally be forced to enter the euro !, 
  someday ... 
  the same rules for non eu players would apply i guess . 
  i think they need to play in their respective national teams or something like that . 
  will the uk be leaving uefa too ? 
  in exchange for eu citizenship ? 
  the point is that a referendum on the euro is not their first priority . 
  you are not the first to project the uk 's views on the rest of europe . 
  they have so many differing views that if the time comes they 'll rip themselves apart .
