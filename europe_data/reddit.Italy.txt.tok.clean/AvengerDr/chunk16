  if they win the election without needing a coalition . 
  if they manage to change the constitution . 
  if they win the confirmative referendum . 
  if they then manage to implement their policy to abandon the euro . 
  there are too many hoops to jump through . 
  you really have no idea what you are talking about , do you ? 
  this constitutional change should be carried on by the m5s , the mastermind politicians who one day are euro-federalists and the next are back with farage ? 
  [ madia and boschi ] ( http://images2.corriereobjects.it/methode_image/2013/12/16/politica/foto%20gallery/bos1_mgzoom.jpg?v=20131216093243 ) two pd politicians . 
  that was more than five years ago . 
  berlusconi has n't been in power since november 2011 . 
  in a scale from 0 to trump , how would you rate italy 's politics ? 
  the point being that if it was n't for brexit , this would n't have happened . 
  at least , not in this magnitude . 
  yes but it is not enough : [ the uk is a net importer ] ( http://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-energy-how-much-what-type-and-where-from/ ) . 
  if the pound falls , every good that is paid in dollars or euros will cost more . 
  which ultimately impacts consumers a lot more . 
  unless you do n't buy food that is not grown/produced in the uk or do not drive a car/buy products that are imported from elsewhere . 
  what about uk * importers * ? 
  a few months ago , the nearest petrol station had diesel at 1.09 # / l. 
  now it 's 1.20 # / l. 
  now let 's see . . is your solution letting them drown or escorting them back to where they came from ? 
  how many of these refugees have eu citizenship ? 
  to be fair , at least 1/3 of the uk 's publications should be distributed between the various eu countries . 
  as the romans used to say : * verba volant , scripta manent * or * spoken words fly away , written words remain . 
  * until i see something official , you 'll understand my cautious distrust . 
  because if we are to base ourselves on proposals , you 'll remember guy verhofstadt 's proposal to give eu citizenship back to the individuals who want it . 
  even renzi ( when he was in power ) proposed to give italian citizenship to brit students in italy . 
  a lot could change from now to the day it 's all settled and done . 
  why would that be ? 
  europeans living in the uk ( including me ) right now are living in a sort of limbo . 
  we face the same risks . 
  for example , i work at a british university , but my girlfriend is still studying for her italian university degree but lives in the uk . 
  i do n't think she would qualify for any kind of permit if they enforce a minimum level of earnings ( as it is for non-eu ) . 
  will i be forced to watch while border agents drag her on a train ? 
  if you send the europeans back , due to the significant percentage of them working in the nhs , who will care for them ? 
  * red , white , and blue * doctors . 
  ok but in the meantime ? 
  sounds like you are qualified enough to work for trump !, 
  you associate mario with italy and not with japan/nintendo ? 
   he speaks english , french , latin and italian i have heard him [ speak italian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yovzkroe-4q ) . 
  i think he needs a bit more practice . 
  to be fair , i got the meaning of what he wanted to say ( all italians are welcome ) , but he is missing a few syllables from the words . 
  precisely , that 's one of the reason they ( the govt ) have been unable to tackle the issue . 
  realistically , how much do you expect to reduce eu immigration after we would need some form of visa to work here ? 
  the point being that you can not expect to simply shut the border and be done with it . 
  but why has n't the government severely curbed non-eu migration ? 
  it was in their powers to do so . 
  you could have shut the border if you wanted . 
  hey come on , we will be the eu 's 3rd biggest economy , please include us too in your dystopian vision !, 
  that 's called a [ treemap ] ( http://www.infovis-wiki.net/index.php?title=treemap ) . 
  the closest i have been to finland is lule\u00e5 in sweden . 
  however , when i landed it was night , so i ca n't say for sure that there was a contiguous landmass where finland should have been . 
  they might be onto something . 
  in this very moment in / r/italy there is a thread about [ why people on reddit are prejudiced against italians ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/5n63od/ma_sbaglio_o_c%c3%a8_un_certo_pregiudizio_verso_gli/ ) . 
  since iceland beat england at the last euros , it seems only fair that they would take their place . 
  [ ** huh !, 
  ** ] ( http://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/huh/ ), 
  well played france !, 
  til there are people proud of the abomination that is mac & cheese . 
  do you think the `` popolo del web '' will accept this ? 
  the base is voting on the various possibilities . 
  and italian prosecco !, 
  as di battista said , this is * `` beautiful , beautiful , beautiful . 
  '' * ca n't wait for them to become staunch eurofederalists !, 
  praise jupiter !, 
  how many european countries are not in the eu ? 
  of these , how many countries ** want ** to be in the eu and have applied to do so ? 
  before we get to discuss whether or not they are christians , i would first question whether people who do not believe in evolution or in young-earth creationism are * sane * beings . 
  the vatican does `` believe '' in the theory of evolution and the big bang ( although with god as its originator ) . 
  protestantism is another thing . 
  i am talking about the countless evangelical denominations in the us that do believe in the literal interpretation of the bible . 
  the vatican does not believe in the literal interpretation of the bible ( [ source ] ( http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/pcb_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19930415_interpretazione_it.html ) in italian on vatican.va ) . 
  that is a ** huge ** difference . 
  how do they count people ? 
  in italy if you have been baptised you count as a catholic . 
  i was baptised but i am now atheist . 
  a lot more people are not praticant even though they were baptised . 
  i would n't conflate catholicism together with the american brands of christianity . 
  they are almost two different religions . 
  but that 's entirely the result of the fptp system . 
  on a more proportional system they 'd be more represented . 
  the referendum was not binding . 
  all it would take is to find someone willing to fall on their sword . 
  is n't it democratic to respect the meaning of a consultive referendum ? 
  [ remindme bot info ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/remindmebot/comments/24duzp/remindmebot_info/ ), 
   it is more important to be right than to be popular . 
  how can you say that he is `` right '' ? 
  politics is not mathematics . 
  they pay more compared to similar distances . 
  once it happened that the delivery company delivered an ssd i bought to somebody else . 
  or that somebody did n't attempt to give it back to me . 
  i called amazon and they just sent another one . 
  i guess it 's cheaper for them than opening an investigation . 
  lol i always get my neighbour 's parcel in the uk . 
  and he usually the sort of guy that bangs the shared wall every single time i decide to play a game in my living room . 
  he 's the reason i have n't yet bought floor standing speakers yet :(, 
  i 'm not sure about italy as it 's been almost six years since i moved to the uk . 
  as the others have said , i guess it depends on the fact that most people live in apartment blocks rather than townhouses . 
  so there 's not really any safe place to leave it by . 
  perhaps if you live in the countryside where detached houses are more common , and there are actual neighbours ...
