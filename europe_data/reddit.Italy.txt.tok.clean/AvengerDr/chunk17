  i do n't even think they deliver on the floor where you live . 
  you have to meet them outside . 
  some fancier residences might have a concierge of sort . 
  they might leave it with her/him . 
  if `` you are n't home '' do they leave it in `` a safe place '' at the bottom of the canal ? 
  it 'll catch up someday , and then we 'll be flooded by * buongiornissimo * shitposts or their future equivalent .

  well soon it 'll be the year 2770 * ad urbe condita * . 
  i guess at least rome qualifies . 
  how are we even communicating then ? 
   it 's too large to be run efficient as a country . 
  do n't tell that to putin . 
  or china ... how does australia do it ? 
  implying there are people who actually like eating * candied fruit * . 
  it comes from venetian iirc `` balota '' . 
  countries with benefits ? 
  so when you leave , terrorism will stop ? 
  so an american leave ? 
   - so if anything we are the legal successor of the roman empire i do n't remember caesar , augustus , trajan , etc. 
  signing anything . 
  all of europe is rightful roman clay , so if that does n't even it out i do n't know what will !, 
  you should know that after 100 years , conquered provinces becomes * de jure * part of the new kingdom . 
  you 'll need a good 20 + diplomat to fabricate a new claim . 
  how do you translate `` gombloddo ! 1 ! 1 '' '' in english ?

  what 's he 's not saying is that as soon as the mayor heard about the ongoing investigation , he self-suspended himself . 
  further , there 's a * slight * difference between an inquiry and an arrest . 
  ^ perfectly represents the `` grillino '' stereotype . 
  * `` yes ours are criminals but yours are too '' *  the fact that is contested to marra , which was already in a high position in the administration of the capitolino hill , has happened 3 years ago . 
  and so ? 
  does this make him less of a criminal ? 
   having dropped it by 0.4 % in october because of brexit effects that never materialized . 
  well so far brexit has n't materialised yet , therefore it 's business as usual . 
  it 's what happens post-art .50 that matters . 
  that might still happen . 
  they counted on cameron invoking art . 
  50 right away . 
  they could at least use decimal miles to indicate distances , *** but no *** , it has to be either fractions of a mile or yards instead . 
  soon the saying * `` like a japanese soldier in the jungle '' * will be replaced by * `` like britain in europe '' . 
  * come on , we could then build an awesome dover-calais bridge !, 
  yes but only when followed by `` e '' or `` i '' . 
  words containing ch - ( a , o , u ) are usually foreign and italians would pronunce the ch as a soft `` c '' , like in `` el che '' or `` churrasco '' . 
  only the brits are left now in europe . 
  come on uk , you can do it too !, 
  and while you 're at it , please get rid of those imperial signs , and embrace the glorious european system . 
  ^ ^ maybe ^ ^ / s, 
  in english they would read `` paschi '' as we would `` pashi '' or `` pasci '' . 
  ask a random anglo-phone to pronounce `` bruschetta '' , 99 % of them will say `` brushetta '' . 
  whereas `` pashci '' sounds more like how the english would write our pronunciation : `` pash-ki '' . 
  probably the author did n't bother to look up the name and just wrote it down as he heard it . 
   the italian senate would n't be elected at all it would have been indirectly elected in local elections . 
   again , post factual information . 
  it 's true the vast majority are `` new men '' , although i would n't say they 're in it for their own gain : they are the only mps who willingly cut in half their wages and refused millions of euros given by the state , if they really were in it only for the money they should have gone to other parties where they keep all their salaries and the millions given by the sate . 
  to someone who was unemployed or working low-wage jobs even half an mp 's salary would be a lot . 
   di maio , the speaker of the lower house , did not manage to complete his university studies . 
   this is another lie , he has a law degree for which he took more time to complete , and that 's actually the norm in italy given how difficult the university system is , in particular for some faculties it 's extremely rare to finish it on time . 
  source ? 
  wikipedia says he was [ unable to complete his studies ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/luigi_di_maio#biografia ) . 
   i agree on the fact that we should cast some light on some secret organizations . 
  i do n't know if you knew , but there was a secret society in italy , of which berlusconi was a member , called p2 that wanted to do a some kind of coup d'etat . 
  they eventually were discovered by the justice system , many people have been convicted for that . 
  so it 's in the interests of everyone to make sure that powerful people do n't abuse their powers like berlusconi tried to do with the p2 . 
  i am aware of that . 
  but the m5s have n't supplied any evidence to their claims . 
  they had conspirationists like claudio messora in charge of their pr . 
  now they have rocco casalino in his place , a former `` big brother '' contestant . 
  their `` base '' does it all the time . 
  any facebook post you open about some irregularities they ( m5s ) might be implicated in , among the first top comments you will regularly see '' ** yes but ** , what about all the people from the pd who are also implicated/been corrupted/etc . '', 
  for example , in italy there are investigations about `` alleged '' fake signatures to support the candidacy of m5s people . 
  when this happens , they say it 's always the fault of the biased press , of grey eminences , and so on . 
  no it 's just that m5s people are n't saints . 
  it , however , shows the lack of political background or any sort of background for that matter , that the m5s mps have . 
  most of them are literally random people who seized the opportunity for their own gain . 
  even the m5s `` front-men '' have no history . 
  di maio , the speaker of the lower house , did not manage to complete his university studies . 
  he worked as a webmaster before going into politics . 
  di battista has a degree in performing arts ( and it shows ) . 
  of course , everybody can run for office , but because of the way their `` primaries '' worked have , in practice , elected people who are ill-prepared to be a politician . 
  are we prepared to have our economical policy set by people who believe that the bilderberg group secretly controls the world ? ^ ^ do ^ ^ you ^ ^ mean ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ not ^ ^ true ?

  here 's an italian [ source ] ( http://espresso.repubblica.it/palazzo/2014/09/26/news/l-eurodeputato-m5s-a-caccia-di-scie-chimiche-ecco-la-lunghissima-lista-dei-complotti-grillini-1.181876 ) the article lists times when some m5s talked about : * chemtrails * scheduled release of beheading videos by * grey eminences * * pinochet better than renzi * we have never been on the moon * terrorist attacks ( in italy during the 70s ) ordained by the secret `` bilderberry '' ( bilderberg ) group , cia , secret services ... * gay conspiracy * nwo behind giving newborns their mother 's surname * links behind esoteric theories and homicides * a * saracen grain ( buckwheat ) conspiracy * -- they wanted to stop its importation because they thought that ( in italian its called saracen , after the civilisation ) it came from the middle-east , but it is actually grown in italy . 
  * rigged european elections * not paying taxes anymore by going back to the lira * bin laden is alive and 9/11 has been a us plan * mermaids really exist * renzi 's pm appointment was already written since he participated a tv quiz show when he was 19 . 
  * how likely is it that a contestant on a tv show in one of berlusconi 's tvs then goes on to become a pm ?!, 
  wake up sheepie !, 
  * you have to understand that most of their mps have no political background . 
  they are literally random people taken off the street who seized the opportunity and got elected when nobody was expecting them go far . 
   who or what is m5s and what do they stand for ? 
  where to begin ... 
  here 's a completely biased opinion : m5s stands for movimento 5 stelle , `` five stars movement '' . 
  it 's a political party founded by beppe grillo , a comedian ( also found guilty of manslaughter and evasion ) based on an anti-establishment platform . 
  in true populist fashion they speak to both sides of the spectrum , and in their ranks they have people to the left of the pd and to the right of the center-right ( raggi - the m5s mayor of rome - has had links with alemanno , the former far-right mayor , as do several of her staff ) . 
  they are pro universal basic income . 
  they are for transparency in politics ( however some stopped being honest as soon as they were elected ) . 
  people from their base are in support of several other silly things ( investigating chemtrails , anti-vaxxers , leaving the euro ) , but since they refuse to be considered a true party , the stance of their `` ruling elite '' is unclear . 
  their party/movement is ruled with an iron fist by grillo , going as far as expelling several elected m5s mps because their stance did n't align with the official policy . 
  it 's not something he wanted , it 's the consequence of not having been able of securing a 2/3 majority in the parliament when the constitutional reform law was being discussed . 
  if the reform passes with a simple majority , a confermative referendum is then called . 
  what is that supposed to mean ? 
   their problem is the euro and they need to exit .
