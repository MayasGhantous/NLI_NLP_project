  keep dreaming . 
  i think that for the m5s * leaving the eu * as a policy is somewhere between investigating chemtrails and making vaccinations purely voluntary . 
  tfw when you have almost all your fortune in a mps account . 
  * best case scenario : * someone else from the pd ( del rio ? ), 
  becomes pm : they go on and vote on a new electoral law . 
  landslide victory of the pd at the next elections , m5s becomes an irrelevant party and everyone lives happily ever after . 
  * worst case scenario : * we somehow go on and vote , m5s wins the elections , they take us out of europe and the eu collapses as a consequence . 
  western civilization comes to an end and the european union [ dissolves into quarreling , bickering nation-states , bent on controlling the last remaining resources on earth . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dquq8dabdw8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m47s ) well you said you wanted the best and worst scenarios . 
  that 's the beauty of a romance language , you can spend hours and say nothing !, 
  but i do n't think an unofficial referendum on that scale has ever happened anywhere on the planet . 
  they really do n't care about membership of the euro ** that ** much to go that extent , in my opinion . 
  that would have people rioting in the streets . 
  they 'd have to run on a platform of leaving the eu , which i think is very unlikely . 
  the senate will also still be there , and with the current electoral law , they might not have a majority there . 
  134 cost . 
  it says that after an initial technical review , the constitutional court will review it to check if it is admissible . 
  they can propose it , but it will be rejected by the constitutional court , and thus never take place . 
   and to be in position to make italy leave the euro and/or the eu . 
  but they do n't even know what they want . 
  if it was a referendum resulting from `` popular initiative '' ( i.e. 
  anyone can call a referendum if they reach 500.000 signatures ) , i think ( but i am no constitutional judge ) it would be rejected before starting by the constitutional court , because referendum are n't allowed on foreign treaties . 
  yes but just on the role of the senate . 
  a referendum was called because the original vote did n't reach 2/3 of the votes in the parliament . 
  as a consequence , a `` confermative referendum '' was called . 
  for the ** hundredth time ** , italy can not have a referendum on the euro . 
  the constitution forbids referendums on foreign treaties . 
  absolutely nothing . 
  no winning just makes it more likely that m5s * could * ( emphasis on * could * ) win the next elections . 
  but they wo n't leave the eu/will not be able to make the eu collapse . 
  [ si ] ( https://i.redd.it/l0ytll8yry9x.jpg ), 
  well times changed a bit since [ then ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wkqit_zrtq ) . 
  but then again , we are talking 10-15 % . 
  unless they enter into a coalition with m5s they wo n't be decisive . 
  does the eu or the euro have an expiration date ? 
  i thought they would stay in effect until voted otherwise . 
   http://www.termometropolitico.it/media/2016/11/sondaggi-movimento-5-stelle-emg-29_11-700x438.jpg  this says 15,2 % . 
  you are grouping fi and ncd together . 
  but ncd is not too far off from the election threshold of 3 % ( if it stays the same ) . 
   they want to leave the euro . 
  that 's the point . 
  they want , but they ca n't . 
  the more fringe part of the m5s do n't know or feign ignorance that italy ca n't just have a referendum on leaving the euro , because our constitution forbids referendums on foreign treaties . 
  i am not sure how italy could effectively leave the euro if they even wanted . 
  i do n't think a simple law would be enough . 
  but that 's how they got ahead : by speaking to both sides . 
  the activists are among some of those who want to leave . 
  but others have said they want to [ stay ] ( http://www.lastampa.it/2016/06/24/italia/politica/il-ms-ha-cambiato-idea-e-non-vuole-pi-il-referendum-per-uscire-dalleuropa-pi0qflj5lwzooxkqucdxnl/pagina.html ) . 
  you 're right , i lumped them together with the populists . 
  but by polling at around 10 % they 're not such a relevant political force anymore . 
  that 's really an exaggeration . 
  the referendum is not focused on the electoral law , but on the role of the senate . 
  in that regard i see the first-past-the-post system as a more serious threat . 
   at the same time , though , it introduces new bugs , modifies some crucial code paths in a confused way and introduces some unclear behaviours . 
  there are even a few lines of code which look like some kind of a back-door . 
  it 's all about that though . 
  how do you know for sure that the changes are inherently wrong ? 
  well done austria !, 
  because he probably thinks that the brexiters and the italian populists share a common destiny . 
  depends who `` we '' is . 
  the xenophobe far right , populists , and a minority of the center left is behind the no . 
  the majority of the center-left ( renzi 's pd ) and a minority of the center-right is behind the yes . 
  do n't worry , i hope to be gone before giving them the satisfaction of having to apply for a work permit or citizenship . 
  so they 're all going to put us on trains back to the continent ? 
  i can see that as being very popular / s, 
  i usually spend my summer holidays at a house near the sea we have in that area ( near porto cesareo ) . 
  i do n't even like going suntanning at the beach . 
  so i am usually like . . what shall we do tonight ? 
  i was there just yesterday . 
  wonderful city !, 
  but i must say you guys really hate your bikes . 
  please oil the chain at least once in a while and do n't just abandon them on the pavement !, 
  david davis and chris christie should be friends . 
  i love mexican food !, 
  just replace some `` s '' - es at the end of your words with vowels and you can pass as calabrians who have a slight preference for rice !, 
   you ca n't get chicken or peppers or any nice spices . 
  chicken on pizza ( or with pasta ) is * haram * . 
  it just is , do n't question it . 
  * has heart attack *, 
  well come on man !, 
  here in the uk i struggle to find even generic italian tomatoes . 
  the golden delicious apples they have in the supermarkets are ridiculous . 
  a very small number of italian men who know how to prepare a ragu ' under extreme conditions . 
  from this [ article ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36101449 ) . 
   admission to the uk can be blocked `` on grounds of public policy , public security or public health '' , according to eu rules . 
  under no circumstances can it be on economic grounds . 
   refusal of entry on public policy or public security grounds must be done on a case-by-case basis rather than with a blanket ban . 
   a person must represent a `` genuine , present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society '' . 
   the rules state that `` criminal convictions shall not in themselves constitute grounds for taking such measures '' . 
  you are confusing schengen with the freedom of movement . 
  if you were not signed up to fom you could refuse entry to any `` rest of '' europe citizen for whatever reason . 
  as things stand now you can only refuse entry to reu citizens for `` policy , security , or health '' reasons . 
  i agree , i love spicy curries ! ^ ^ / s, 
  real italian * alphas * know how to cook on their own !, 
  to mediterranean people in the * `` exclusion zone '' * , do n't despair !, 
  you should read the map as belonging to the * `` mostly safe to eat '' * zone :d the concentric circles are just a neat graphical design trick , but all italians , with a gun pointed to their head , would rather eat other mediterranean countries ' food than those from more * distant lands . 
  some bars in italy do use freshly roasted beans . 
  regarding different brewing methods , they are not necessarily better . 
  i have tried coffee brewed with a cafetiere press but i really do n't like it . 
  like with pasta , i have seen `` others '' trying to use `` different cooking methods '' like boiling pasta in cold water with all the other ingredients and sauce all together .
