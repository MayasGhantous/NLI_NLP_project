  i would encourage those to follow this video 's [ method ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=begbrrojm0e ) . 
  '' * what about pizza with feta ? 
   but nowadays you can get a lot better ** coffee-based drinks ** in most countries , ftfy . 
  espresso ** is ** coffee , what you are referring to are just ~ ~ perversions ~ ~ drinks in which espresso is used . 
  you ca n't modernize espresso , it would be like modernizing water . 
  in italian it 's `` l'aia '' literally farm/barnyard . 
  how so ? 
  the popular vote system would make the 50 % +1 majority the decider of an election , regardless of where they are located . 
  you assume that ny and ca will vote the same way forever , but it 's not a given . 
  it 's a crime as well , but because of its connections to fascism . 
  however , punishment depends on the seriousness of the act . 
  if it is in relation to a demonstration or event , then it is usually followed up . 
  just do n't get any weird ideas about atlantropa . 
  i like the mediterranean sea very much thank you . 
  missed opportunity to upload just a map of england . 
   yes , of course . 
  it 's all a bit ` bernie can still win ! ', 
  to think we 're ever coming back . 
  * ever * is a very long period . 
  i wish i had the same certainties in life you do . 
  nevertheless , we 'll see who will have the `` last '' laugh -- at least for the 1st half of the 21st century . 
  because it 's already happening . 
  have you not seen the flight towards the eu of banks and other businesses ? 
  further , the brain drain is already happening . 
  i myself am an academic that will move to northern europe in a few months . 
  the italian embassy polled us academics in the uk to see who was considering moving and as many as 40 % of the responders were considering a move . 
  other people that i know personally are also moving . 
  nations like canada or australia/nz have never been part of a supranational organisation like the eu . 
  therefore their post-ww2 economy has evolved independently of it . 
  you can not compare losing something that you had ( i.e. 
  membership of the single market , fom ) to never having had it . 
  the difference is going to be felt . 
  the uk , differently from canada/aus/nz on the other hand has been intertwined with the eu since the last 40 years . 
  so untangling itself from the eu is not something that can be done overnight . 
  it will spend years trying to replicate all the functions the eu did for the uk too , like the various agencies that now have to be replicated ( ema , euratom , the openskies agreement , ... ) and trying to renegotiate the trade deals it will literally lose overnight . 
  it will be free to negotiate new trade deals with other countries , that 's true . 
  but it will have to do so from a weakened position , compared to the eu-27 . 
  will these new deals be so much better that it will all have been worth it ? 
  i seriously doubt it . 
  they could even be worse . 
  and it ca n't ignore europe either . 
  it will remain a few kms from the closest coast , whereas canada , australia and nz will stay literally an ocean away . 
  that is , if there 's no noticeable change between pre-brexit and post-brexit . 
   you realise the importance of something once it 's gone . 
  what if conditions deteriorate to the point that rejoining the eu will be seen as an improvement ? 
  if that comes to pass , then brexit will be seen as having accelerated the uk 's eventual integration to the european project . 
  i 'd really be surprised if the uk will `` resist '' more than 5 or 10 years outside the eu . 
  do you really believe you will stay out forever ? 
  as / u/bluemercian said it would only take one pro-eu pm to take you back in . 
  what happens if you get one after brexit ? 
  i think the i in pigs originally stood for ireland . 
  then they came up with piigs to include italy too . 
  but what do you mean by poor , though ? 
  widespread hunger and urban decay ? 
  i am originally from the south . 
  there are surely less opportunities ( i 'm an academic now working in northern europe ) but people there are not dying of hunger . 
  [ here 's my view . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/roman_empire_trajan_117ad.png/1200px-roman_empire_trajan_117ad.png ), 
   there is soon there and they are all poor . 
  you guys must all be saudi princes if you classify the 8th largest economy in the world as a poor country . 
   former roman nations ( romanic/greek ) around the mediterranean 5th . 
  then why is not gallia together with the southern european ones ? 
  you 'll recall that * gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres * . 
  is this going to become the czech equivalent to * british sovereignty * ? 
  the taliban were the state in afghanistan , the parts they controlled . 
  the vietcong had regular army units too.the mujahideen received support from the us too . 
  i am not familiar with the moros . 
  the point being that if you start to include foreign support to a militia , in the form of training , support , personne , and weapons ... what 's the point of having access to guns during peacetime ? 
  you are not going to use your desert eagle to shoot down helicopters or blow up tanks . 
  you either have to raid an army base or rely on some foreign power . 
  in italy during ww2 , the * partigiani * were able to become a * well organised militia * without having prior access to weapons like in the us . 
  they got theirs by raiding military deposits and , later , relied on the allies . 
  they were able to organise a decent resistance ( but the allies helped them ) . 
  that 's why i do n't believe easy access to guns during peacetime is necessary . 
  looking at a recent example it looks like even isis is being defeated by the iraqi military . 
  and you really believe that a * well organized militia * would be able to conclusively defeat a professional army ? 
  it would have been devastating . 
  i 'm not sure whether the tabloid would have been on the leave side too . 
  i can see the headlines warning pensioners about the potential devaluation of their savings . 
  but also prompting them to return to the queen 's currency . 
  i am one of those . 
  moving to leuven in a few months . 
  i hope you people will tolerate my italian accented dutch !, 
  you can not know if you would n't be better today had you joined the euro . 
  inb4 greece . 
  the uk is not greece . 
  guess we 'll know once and for all when the uk rejoins . 
  have you ever been to italy ? 
  exactly !, 
  we usually refer to `` calculus '' as `` analisi matematica '' ( or just analisi in most curriculums ) which clearly stands for `` mathematical analysis '' . 
  whereas calculus refers to a specific part of the broader area of mathematical analysis that we refer to as `` calcolo infinitesimale '' ( infinitesimal calculus ) . 
  why do you call him christopher columbus though ? 
  if he was here , and you shouted his name , he would n't turn his head i reckon . 
   crazy that half of all of our immigration comes from a mere 27 countries crazy what geographic distances can do for you , eh ? 
  the [ milano bid ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xopxae8qsw8 ) is very well made too . 
  of course i might be biased because i am italian , but it is very inspirational , and i do n't like milano even that much . 
  well i doubt they will be deciding purely based on the videos . 
  i do live in the uk . 
  i am upset that the opportunity i was given will not be granted to other people like me . 
  i am not one of those people that as long as it does n't affect him or her , they do n't care .
