  it just makes that particular country a socially backward place . 
  the universal declaration of human rights can be a good starting point . 
  it does n't matter how many people are in favour of violating those rights , it 's still wrong . 
  so if the majority of a country votes in a referendum to ban same-sex marriages or abortion , does the will of the people justify the outcome ? 
  i do n't think so , there are some universal values and rights that should bear no connection to how many people are in favour of them . 
  even if there 's only one person in favour of gay marriages or women 's right to an abortion , that does n't make him/her wrong just because s/he is in the minority , it only makes the majority wrong . 
  moods might change very quickly once it 's all done and dusted and scotland is outside the eu against its will . 
  but you surely understand the reach of your vote . 
  now i do n't know how you two met exactly , but if freedom of movement will be limited , if the uk no longer participates to the erasmus , it will certainly make it more difficult for these relationships to happen . 
  so if you had n't yet met your polish wife , this vote would have made the life path you took more difficult . 
  if you live in a family guy episode , sure . 
  how did your wife take it ? 
  you could also use augmented reality for that , in a future where it works as it does in the hololens concept videos . 
  it would be particularly useful in the imperial forums standing next to it , or in athens , where in some places just a few stones remain . 
  i know . 
  but ... western pagan roman empire best empire , 
  i did n't know the ottomans were around in the 5 ^ th century already . 
  you have to select * custom * to be able to deselect ttip , otheriwse it will also install the ttip toolbar . 
  and here you can see what caused the diaspora of italian academics . . sigh ... 
  that would be rather obvious . 
  have a look at the text and the words used . 
   determined to lay the foundations of ** an ever closer union among the peoples of europe ** europe , not * western * europe , nor * southern * europe , not even * central * europe . 
  just europe . 
  was there a scarcity of geography books back then ? 
  what ? 
  `` ever closer union '' was put down in [ black and white ] ( http://lawvolumes.dwp.gov.uk/docs/a9-1001.pdf#page=2 ) since the treaty of rome . 
  if you or your politicians never decided to inform you about that , it 's certainly not the eu 's fault . 
  of course italy does . 
  then they have no problems when [ actual bodies ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/padre_pio_da_pietrelcina#/media/file:s.giovanni_rotondo_ ( 19 \\ ) . jpg ) ( or what 's left of them ) are exhibited publicly or paraded around italy . 
  that person ( `` padre pio '' ) is arguably also one of the biggest frauds in catholic history . 
  that is what [ manslaughter ] ( http://www.wordreference.com/enit/manslaughter ) means . 
  whether he has a clear conscience after unintentionally causing the death of three persons is up to him . 
  [ wikipedia says ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/beppe_grillo#procedimenti_giudiziari ) he was convicted of `` omicidio plurimo colposo '' , which i thought was the italian term for manslaughter . 
  i 'm not a lawyer so i do n't know exactly . 
  still , it 's a pretty heavy burden : three people died . 
  but ... muh german cars !, 
  they are expelled from the ~ ~ movement ~ ~ party . 
  if they hold office , they can no longer say that they represent the m5s . 
  they either continue as independents , retire , or join another party . 
  america 's doors were never explicitly open to us europeans in recent times . 
  you have to go back centuries to find uncontrolled immigration to the usa . 
  we will have free movement up until the day you leave . 
  then , something will have to change . 
  future eu citizens that want to live in the uk will be barred from doing so . 
  that 's a big door that is going to be shut , and the same will apply to those who want to live in europe . 
  every m5s politician will have to pay $ 150000 if they violate their [ code ] ( http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2016/06/22/virginia-raggi-anche-per-gli-assessori-multa-di-150mila-euro-per-chi-viola-il-codice-m5s/2851375/ ) . 
  i am actually not sure if he can be elected , if he wanted . 
  he was convicted of manslaughter . 
  http://flagsarenotlanguages.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/steam.png website name checks out . . :d, 
  what happens with movies or tv shows that have russians as the `` bad guys '' ? 
  a recent example would be `` president petrov '' in house of cards , or `` the americans '' . 
  who are the bad guys in your movies ? 
  dubbed means that you hire professional voice actors ( in the target language ) to completely re-do all dialogues . 
  you either keep only the `` background '' sound track ( if available ) , or start from scratch and hire sound engineers to also re-do sound effects . 
  like foot steps , traffic , etc. 
  if these are recorded within the dialogue . 
  it 's like in video games , you hire voice actors whose voice would be a good match for the character they are portraying . 
  in a voice over instead , you just turn down the volume of the whole soundtrack , and have one guy read the script . 
  * one guy that reads every character 's dialogue . 
  in italy they dub everything . 
  i prefer to watch movies in their original language if i understand it . 
  that being said , italian dubbers are professional voice actors . 
  in general the quality is very good . 
  obviously , a lot will be lost in translation , such as the subtleties of the language , specific accents , etc. 
  some of the actors also built their careers on the particular voice they have , which is difficult to replace . 
  although in some cases the voices are nearly identical . 
  e.g. , the italian dubber for harrison ford in indiana jones , di caprio 's , bart simpson 's , etc. 
  but with just one guy * reading * the script and not even trying to show a hint of emotions ... 
  i do n't know , it seems like a terrible idea . 
  you 're just paying some guy to read the script for you . 
  i am able to follow subtitles and listen to the original voices at the same time . 
  i happened to view for a few minutes a polish dubbing of a movie . 
  how can a single voice not ruin the whole movie ? 
  what 's the point of it ? 
  if those options were viable you think they would n't have considered them ? 
  from this thread , it 's apparent that lack of solidarity is a fault italy can not be accused of , but if their hands were not tied , they would surely seek an alternative . 
  you know we can not do that . 
  maybe in the future , when the situation in lybia is improved . 
  `` asking europe '' . 
  we 're all europe . 
  australia can do that because they have the support of indonesia . 
  and you now well we ca n't just send them back to those countries and wash our hands of the resulting blood . 
  so you would watch people drown and do nothing , even if you could help them ? 
   if anybody , than it should be italy to leave the union . 
  because it can \u00b4 t protect eu border from large-scale illegal immigration . 
  it fails its obligations . 
  that 's easy to say when you are not a peninsula at a stone 's throw from north africa . 
  what are we supposed to do , sink the boats ? 
  wait what ? 
  it was the roman salute !, 
  til , never heard it being called that way . 
  i 'm also looking to move elsewhere . 
  i have not yet been affected , but that 's precisely the point : i want to move before being affected becomes likely . 
  what if they introduce a minimum earnings cutoff like there is now for non-eu workers ( # 36k ) ? 
  if my girlfriend does n't earn that , will i have to see her deported ? 
  and no , i wo n't get british citizenship . 
  i do n't want to be associated with a country that decides to shut its doors to people like me . 
   my italian host family did n't eat anything for breakfast ( and offered me kiddie breakfast like muffins instead of fulfilling like rye bread , porridge or even m\u00fcsli ) , of course . 
  what , you needed something else besides an espresso and maybe a cornetto ? 
   the `` lunch '' at 12.00 was stuff that we call a snack .
