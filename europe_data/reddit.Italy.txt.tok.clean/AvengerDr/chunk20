  i am upset that part of the the people of britain have voted to keep out others like me . 
  you are missing the point . 
  you have to see freedom of movement for * europeans * ( more exactly : citizens of the eu ) , not for british , french and italians , etc. 
  in that sense , there are only two cases : you are either a citizen of the european union or not . 
  no preference , just one ( bigger ) motherland . 
  i am an academic moving to europe . 
  there are some benefits , surely but i was n't offered double salary . 
  but i believe in the european project and truly felt betrayed . 
  i would n't have looked abroad if not for brexit . 
   i would argue that moving towards a system whereby priority of residence is not given to eu members simply because they are eu members over , say , canadians or australians who are equally qualified is more meritocratic . 
  that 's true if you do n't feel european . 
  do you feel any distinctions between english , welsh , scottish and northern irish ? 
  some of us feel that there are no distinction between italians and french , poles and portuguese and so on . 
  we have so much more in common than what sets us apart . 
  that was true then . 
  now the whole picture must also include that the uk chose isolationism over internationalism and european co-prosperity . 
  in my book that 's a pretty non-progressive reactionary stance . 
   how many british citizens move to romania to reap the benefits of their health service i wonder ? 
  how many people move to the orkneys ? 
  how many people move to wales or northern ireland ? 
  how many to brexit capitols like sunderland ? 
  they go where the need is . 
  you 'll be familiar with the fact that areas with high immigration have voted in favour of remain . 
  people do n't move to romania because some areas are not yet competitive with western europe . 
  that was one of the aims of the eu , bring everyone to the same level . 
  inb4 `` by dragging the uk down . '', 
  i did and that 's why i call bullshit . 
  alone , neither of m5s , fi or ln will be able to win a majority on their own . 
  they have said multiple times they wo n't ally with each other . 
  we might see a minority m5s government which will attempt to form a majority . 
  if they have lied and they ( m5s ) will ally with someone else it will likely result in constant bickering and they wo n't be able to last for long and will implode sooner rather than later . 
  if they somehow are able to hold onto their seats , the italian constitution explicitly forbids referendums on foreign policy matters . 
  they would either have to change the constitution , or take us out unilaterally . 
  plus !, 
  we will by then have the example of britain to go by . 
  * `` look at what 's happening in the uk '' * might become a phrase very frequently uttered in any debate around our potential exit from the eu . 
  and i can not believe a founding member would not even try to change things from the inside ( even * some * of the m5s said this , even salvini ! ), 
  rather than leave it like the british did . 
  i would question the * `` much bigger '' * part . 
  we still have many more world cups anyway :d, 
   it 's not that far away the possibility of an italian exit from europe oh come on !, 
  italy is one the founder nations . 
  if italy leaves , it 's over . 
  by the time you are allowed to negotiate trump will be on its way out . 
  it will languish in congress and before you know it , there will likely be a different president who might have a completely different view . 
  because , as everybody knows , scotland , wales , northern ireland have always the same opinions as england . 
  do i need the / s ? 
  it 's not as easy as it sounds . 
  those agreement were drafted in order to protect everybody 's ( ie every member country ) interest . 
  the uk on its own might have different interests and it would be stupid to just clone the eu trade deal without revieweing whether it aligns with its , new , interests as an `` independent '' country , all alone , in this new world .

  `` semi-sovereign '' , come on !, 
  i think it still is a case of political opportunism . 
  were i a politician firmly in favour of the eu , i would never have wanted my name to be forever associated to brexit . 
  i would never be able to willingly do something that goes against everything i believe in . 
  that 's what resignations are for . 
  if you truly believe in something , you would not change your views for political opportunism . 
  if she meant it , she should have let someone else do it . 
  it 's all thanks to [ ezio auditore ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlk70j-ztru ) . 
   get a good french press heresy !, 
  are you seriously implying that the uk is the only thing saving us from a russian apocalypse ? 
  and even if it was , once they reach france , who do you think would be next ? 
  perhaps you might be able to negotiate some kind of appeasement ? 
   of course this is caused by brexit , not entirely sure what your point is though , people were saying it would be much , much worse than this if we left ( i know , i know , we have n't left yet ) i meant that these persons moving from the uk to the eu are * x * less uk taxpayers that would n't have moved if not for brexit . 
  exemption from eu integration is mostly an immaterial `` benefit '' ( i 'd say it 's a disadvantage ) . 
  similarly putting a stop to fom . 
  i do n't think it will solve the problems you wanted to address , at least imho . 
   good for frankfurt on this news , and good for dublin/paris/wherever else gets an eu base , but i do n't think it 's really cause for smug `` london 's burning ! '', 
  celebrations . 
  is this something that would n't have happened if not for brexit ? 
  where 's the silver lining ? 
  even if just one job had been lost ? 
  together with germany !, 
  we good then !, 
  not just by themselves . 
  they can not enact their more hardline `` policies '' if there 's a more moderate counter-balance in the coalition . 
  an m5s-lega coalition would be the stuff of nightmares . 
  forza nuova has never ruled . 
  lega nord has never ruled . 
  do n't they deserve the same chance of ruling ? 
  / s why only m5s ? 
  the thing is , they are ruling . 
  many people including myself , are scared to think what would happen with a raggi-like disaster on a national scale .

   it 's bad enough that all the propoganda outlets ( the mail , express , sun ... ) will spin this as johnson being a skilled negotiator .

  this was a few months ago : i thought i had found a good price on amazon uk for a bottle of talisker whiskey . 
  then after a few weeks i went back to ( southern ) italy on holidays and i was curious to see how expensive it was over there . 
  result : it was cheaper in italy . 
  it was like # 33 vs $ 32 or something like that . 
  maybe it 's more about regional pricing than cost of transportation . 
  we 'll see how it goes if tariffs will be applied on it . 
    her mayness had this plan to copy-paste eu law into national law and change as she sees fit after this whole mess is done . 
  unless i understood that one wrong . 
  sounds both lazy and dodgy . 
  you got a source for whatever you 're talking about ? 
  i thought we were reverting back to uk law for the most part , are you talking about product regulations ? 
  that would seem sensible to me , i do n't think the uk had many gripes with eu regulations when it comes to products .
