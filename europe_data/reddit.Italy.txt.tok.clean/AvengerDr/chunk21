  [ britain targets legal certainty with plan to convert eu law after brexit ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-lawmaking-idukkbn17037i ) they want ( ed ? ), 
  to incorporate eu law wholesale and then revise it as time goes by . 
  exactly , the temples of jupiter and mars should be restored !, 
  i do n't think that is how gods work . 
  i 'll admit i 'm more familiar with the christian variety , but is n't allah also omniscient ? 
  the concept of time would be meaningless to a god described as such . 
  at any point in time he/she/it would know all there is ever to know . 
  why would it change their mind ? 
  * god works through mysterious ways . 
  * yes , through the actions of fallible men and their imagination . 
  it 's an annotated quran . 
  look to the right , there are lists of references to contradictory passages , and other stuff in the quran . 
  the lady who wanted to maintain lists of foreign workers in the uk would also be interesting . 
  amber rudd ? 
   it 's time for the eu to choose whether it wants to be an idiot or not . 
  i thought having voted for brexit had already settled that . 
  there 's no written constitution so i guess it 's fair game . 
  * s.p.q.e. 
  intensifies . 
  this , i do n't know , * malthusian * analysis assumes that everything will stay as it is . 
  it does n't consider that many of these immigrants , especially their kids , will westernise and/or become non-practicing . 
  it does n't consider outside influences or events . 
  so unless you 're hari seldon and i 'm the emperor of trantor , i would take this with a grain of salt . 
  to be fair , i would also be scared if paris , berlin or brussels would become 3/4 of practicing and committed christian believers . 
  you sure ? 
  just outside my window i can spot a dozen of them . 
  waiting . 
  they follow my every move , i say !, 
  do you believe it possible that in the next hundred years , the eu or the us will ever be under military occupation by fundamentalist islamic forces ? 
  will we ever have to sit at a table with al-baghdadi to ratify our unconditional surrender ? 
   `` i have a device in my pocket containing the sum of all human knowledge . 
   i use it to view pictures of cats , and start arguments with strangers . '', 
  can we exchange them for i do n't know , parts of argentina ? 
  imagine how much our football team would be strengthened . 
  at least the argentinians would love to become italians !, 
  random person on the internet , i have to ask : when you and all the countless other people repeat this joke , would you have preferred italy to continue fighting with the nazis till the end ? 
  why ? 
   whenever an italignorant tries to delegitimise historical german toponyms it is our right to correct him/her . 
  has to do with self respect and dignity . 
  so we should start calling almost every european city with their historical latin toponyms ? 
  actually these temples were mostly destroyed by christian fundamentalists . 
  in italy we use the idiom * `` armiamoci e partite '' * to describe this behaviour , * `` let 's arm ourselves ( for war ) , and then you go . 
  '' * you would n't want to be that soldier , but you expect others to fire at will on unarmed civilians . 
  because professional soldiers obviously do n't have any humanity or feelings left in them . 
  would you personally push the trigger ? 
  `` them '' being people like you , i assume . 
  would you press the trigger ? 
  now , please tell the world that you would have no remorse whatsoever and would personally fire , should you hypothetically be behind the trigger . 
  i guess it means that israel ( or jews ) are literally * behind everything * !, 
  i look forward to the day when museums of modern arts worldwide will embrace memes . 
  i would finally be able to say with conviction `` i could have done that '' , and it would actually be true . 
  although i dislike `` organised '' forms of atheism , i think associations like those are necessary , because too often the separation between church/religion and state exists only on paper . 
  too often religious ideologies influence politics , which have an effect on people 's lives and it should n't be that way . 
  speak for yourself . 
  you wo n't solve anything outside the eu . 
  this problem can only be solved if we all cooperate together , not just by italy alone . 
  retreat to the antonine wall !, 
  just played the italian mission in battlefield 1 the other night !, 
  time to take out the historically accurate full body metal armor and waltz all over the mountains !, 
  you can have trieste . 
  all you have to do is becoming part of a *** greater friuli venezia giulia !, 
  i would like to see how you would fare with sea on all sides , instead of being a landlocked country . 
  just like all those italians who emigrated to america ? 
  they built a country sure enough , but it was n't their own . 
  unesco heritage sites maybe ? 
  the savoias were exiled after ww2 . 
  they were only allowed back in 2002 . 
  emanuele filiberto , the current `` heir '' ( yeah yeah it 's disputed ) , ran for office in 2008 but he took 0.4 % as a candidate in a foreign constituency . 
  camp your army outside and just wait it out until their morale drops to zero . 
  with a fort level that high , it will take a few years . 
  though you will have to get your warscore to 100 for them to surrender . 
  be sure to take castel gandolfo too . 
  * more so * than the actual vatican ? 
  the literal successor of the guys who indicted crusades ? 
  thanks !, 
  my pension situation is going to look like a real european nightmare , between three different countries , one of which might still be out of the eu by the time i retire . 
   drive on the right side of the road . 
   adopt the euro . 
  insert two-buttons guy meme . 
  immediately afterwards , i started to search for positions in europe ( i work at a british university ) . 
  i found one and will be moving in october . 
  i will have to learn a new language and settle to a new way of life . 
  if this had n't happened , i would have been happy to stay in the uk , but at least in my field there 's too much uncertainty to trust the government that everything will be alright . 
  so when a much better opportunity arose i took it . 
   [ * `` the decision taken in 1975 by this country to join the common market has now been reversed . 
  '' * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=san9dw_srpa ) that sentence by the bbc journalist will remain in my mind forever . 
  and it changed my life . 
  the euro is a ~ ~ dish ~ ~ currency best served cold . 
  i 'm sure mafia tourism is a thing in italy too . 
  who does n't want to go to casal di principe or corleone ? 
  but it is an order of magnitude ( if not more ) less than the main attractions in italy . 
  likewise , data shows that people visits the uk mostly for its cultural attractions . 
  she will find another vessel to inhabit . 
  have they applied for permanent residency ? 
  too bad the [ top visited uk attractions ] ( http://www.alva.org.uk/details.cfm?p=423 ) have nothing to do with the monarchy . 
  they are mostly museums . 
  it 's just a myth . 
  let 's put it this way : italy is not part of the eu . 
  that money is then spent on other programs . 
  * let 's give it to the ~ ~ nhs ~ ~ ssn instead !,
