  * an earthquake hits . 
  now italy does not have that money even though * it could have had it . 
  * the existence of that fund ensures that there is money for these specific circumstances . 
  before that , we 'll have to deal with the inevitable marxit . 
  fun fact : [ you could actually have bought an italian uk tshirt ] ( http://gazzettadimodena.gelocal.it/modena/cronaca/2012/08/06/news/union-jack-tricolore-by-lapo-per-aiutare-i-terremotati-emiliani-1.5510735 ) . 
  it was an exclusive fashion line by italian designer lapo elkann in 2012 to help earthquake victims . 
  that does n't happen overnight . 
  in germany a rapid google search says it takes 8 years . 
  then what tells you everybody wants to come in the uk ? 
  maybe some , but it does n't make sense that as soon as they get their german citizenship everybody will go like * `` ok boys , let 's pack it up and move our life , our family , everything to good ol' blighty . 
  '' * maybe someday you will admit that you were fed lies . 
  did they tell you that migrants were coming from countries outside the eu and that you were free to do whatever you wanted ? 
   `` i came not to bring peace , but to bring a sword '' - jesus christ matthew 10:34 scholars insist it is an allegory , but the literal interpretation is not so hippie-sounding . 
  trust me , it tends to matter a lot if you happen to die , regardless of how . 
  just today ( the 20th ) the express had on its cover a headline about the temperature being * 90f * . 
  i thought you guys were okay with celsius at least . 
  even the bbc uses it . 
  did you ever use fahrenheit here ? 
  were they trying to appeal to octogenarians ? 
  but how can they be sure that their loyalty lies with the uk instead of the rest of the continent ? 
  i guess he refers to details like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/darth_vader_grotesque ) . 
  please will someone make a simpsons eu/ussr gif !, 
  it 's badly needed for times like this . 
  ^ ^ although ^ ^ i ^ ^ would ^ ^ greatly ^ ^ prefer ^ ^ an ^ ^ eu/spqr ^ ^ variant . 
  well it 's all about whether or not you have some faith in humanity left . 
  i do and i think the lack of a major war in western europe is a testament to this positive direction . 
  i believe the eu was a major contributing factor . 
   europeans are murderous bastards who exterminated ten millions of my compatriots ; how on earth is that good ? 
  those europeans are no longer alive . 
  of course not . 
  it 's a possibility * but a very unlikely one . 
  * do the last 70 years of western european politics suggest you that it could be a much more likely outcome ? 
  let me guess , you solve every dispute through an armed show of force ? 
  so by avoiding doing anything that carries a minimum risk you should not do anything at all . 
  just spend the rest of your life in a bed and hope that the roof does n't fall on your head . 
  the benefits in this case greatly outweigh the risks . 
  we are not talking about `` this has 50 % / 50 % chance of being good/evil '' . 
   gee , yes , because it 's not like a major country just left because of lack of sufficient civic control over the unelected bureaucracy . 
  why yes of course , the uk mainly left because the eu was forcing their utopian visions of straight bananas in their supermarkets . 
  the uk is so against unelected bureaucrats that they have an unelected head of state and an unelected upper house . 
  * that will show them , huh ? 
   should have really taken my time and taken a online course just for this little pic i found funny . 
  jokes aside , you might not think it means much , but saying that 500 + million people are nazi is not funny at all . 
  but perhaps that was precisely your intent . 
  no the eu are not just the bureaucrats in brussels , we are the eu too . 
  what i do n't get from you * `` the eu will turn into a repressive police state '' * people is why this scenario is a ) likely b ) why is it only cited in the context of the eu and never in a national context ? 
  could n't a national government * `` sooner or later the national government of x will use the army against its citizens '' * c ) why the set of balances and checks will fail to protect us from this specific tin-foil conspiracy scenario ? 
  oh were you blending them ? 
  my bad . 
  then why is the white part still there ? 
  it should have a blue background then . 
  also , next time , use vector graphics . 
  there are some horrendous rasterization artefacts . 
  people on / r/vexillology would have a fit . 
  because they do n't want to be next ? 
  `` you have to supply x troops to the common army . 
  up to you how . '', 
  low effort . 
  those are not even the same colors of the eu flag . 
  try again . 
   canada is perfectly able to apply for membership if it wants do you want a terran federation ? 
  that 's how you get a terran federation . 
  why ? 
  the uk would n't be in it . 
  you could even veto their accession when they want to rejoin . 
  but by not voting they stated they would not have been bothered either way . 
  so the uk will rejoin the eu after three days ? 
  i did n't think it would be that fast !, 
  the country also has to appreciate you as a person and make you feel welcome . 
  otherwise people would be much more inclined to work in places like dubai or saudi arabia . 
  does it involve tentacles ? 
  asking for a friend . 
  so who is actually footing the bill ? 
  wo n't this lead to a sub-prime like crisis eventually ? 
  it 's not a good analogy . 
  a better one would be puerto rico , which although being part pf the us , was voting a few days ago to become their 51st state . 
  or cuba , canada , or other caribbean nations . 
  but the most important difference is that you will have been part of the eu . 
  anyway , will you also not join the terran federation , centuries from now when we will be colonizing the stars and/or fighting aliens ? 
  the exemption from ever closer union has been voided by brexit , so technically the uk is still en route towards being eventually subsumed in the european superstate . 
  lol preferring to head towards a disaster rather than swallowing one 's pride . 
  if it makes you happy ... 
  but i think you are only delaying the inevitable . 
  can you really see the uk staying out forever ? 
  [ atms are in latin . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/vatican_latin_atm.jpg ), 
  his contract ended ? 
  do it !, 
  is there any way we can stream the negotiations as a netflix show ? 
   * in this episode , british rebel without a cause nigel farage negotiates the straightness of bananas with the eu . 
  he will soon find out that he will be getting more than he bargained for . 
  lol , every time i go in a restaurant in the uk , i ca n't help it , but i usually do that gesture to ask for a table for two . 
  it might not be official policy but many of their supporters are the likes of `` italians first !! 1 !?!, 
  stop paying immigrants to be in hotels ! 1 ! '' . 
  also because some of their `` members '' expressed these `` opinions '' at some point . 
  most of europe will be like `` two ? 
  two what ? '', 
  special deals not meaning cameron 's but the rebate and the euro . 
  oh boy how fun would this be if from hard brexit this turned into * hard remain * . 
  where can i preorder the british euros ?
