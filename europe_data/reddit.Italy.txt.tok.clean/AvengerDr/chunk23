   certainly if you say so . 
  why ? 
  the problem is that you are very scared of having to learn another language . 
  did you really * have * to build him a statue ? 
  imagine what we could have [ accomplished together ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roma_eterna ) with a * romanised germania . 
  but can they enforce it ? 
  i 'm not sure . 
  i think they will trade support for hard brexit in exchange of tory support for some draconian social policy . 
  * `` she merely adopted gesticulating . 
  we were born in it , moulded by it . 
  i maintain that what the uk is doing is much worse . 
  the us will rid itself of trump in 4 , 8 years at most . 
  brexit will have much more lasting effects . 
  only because there is the rule of law holding them back . 
  if the set of balances and checks failed somehow , i 'm sure ni would turn into a version of * the handmaid 's tale * overnight . 
  but how can they ( the uk ) sell it at home , by not stopping freedom of movement ? 
  i guess it is so that they could go back to the most ~ ~ ignorant ~ ~ * uninformed * fringes of their voting base and say * `` see ? 
  we left the eu , now bow before us !, 
  exactly , no more mocking our `` stable '' government from now on . 
  i am not suggesting i have any authority , but if you have been following this , you 'll be aware that the four freedoms are not up to discussion . 
  they have said it multiple times . 
  it is still theoretically possible they ( the eu ) renege to this promise , but not without paying a price , possibly risking the eu itself if they agree to end fom and leave the uk in the single market . 
  what ? 
  do you think the uk is now in a stronger position to negotiate membership of the single market * without * freedom of movement ? 
  til the tories are socialists . 
  hard brexit : leaving the single market , stop to freedom of movement . 
  soft brexit : leaving the eu in name only , seeking an arrangement like norway 's . 
  not in the eu proper , in the single market , and with freedom of movement . 
  nuclear brexit : the uk comes crashing out of the negotiations without a deal . 
  people could get repatriated , lorries stuck at the border , total chaos . 
  like what ? 
  you ca n't stop freedom of movement while staying in the single market . 
   for not ` fullfiling democratic standards ' or ` not taking refugee quota ' whatever excuse eu commission will use at time . 
  well this * is * tinfoil stuff . 
  i am confident there is a sufficient set of balances and checks to avoid this kind of scenario . 
  i heard there is a country that is currently leaving the european union , * `` without a single bullet being fired . '' *, 
  why would it be used against a member country ? 
  i could imagine if one country turned rogue and started terrorising its citizens . 
  but implying that the eu army would resort to false flag operations to depose national leaders is tinfoil stuff . 
  once you abandon local militias in favour of a professional army , if [ country ] collapses you would n't have an army . 
  so the real culprit is continental drifting and the tectonic plates ? 
  is italy 's fault that it is a peninsula close to na ? 
  if you were out at sea and in need of assistance would you rather they ignored you ? 
  for russia or for the uk ? 
  the best time to create an eu army was decades ago . 
  the next best moment to create an eu army is today . 
  `` conquering rome '' is their stated endgoal . 
  maybe , there is a small chance that italy has been good at thwarting their efforts ? 
  this is not a matter of principle . 
  it is a real problem happening now . 
  do you not care the slightest about what is happening in italy and greece ? 
  what ? 
  a baby is born without any idea or knowledge about god and their culture . 
  it is the environment they live in which moulds their belief . 
  is it just a random occurrence that the majority of christians live in the western world , the majority of muslims live in the middle east/na and the majority of buddhists in asia , and so on and on ... ? 
  now , you as a parent , you can either force your kid to `` believe '' in a religion before they 're old enough to understand what it means , or you can wait until they reach that decision on their own , if they wish . 
  why should a child have a religion `` by default '' , instead of being something that one could only choose once adult ? 
  topeka , kansas or petersburg , kentucky . 
  can you be sure that no 10th generation italian or british citizen would ever radicalise on their own ? 
  there 's plenty of troubled youth looking for a lost cause . 
  my liege , my work in stockholm seems to have come to fruition . 
  by bribing , cajoling , extorting , threatening and forging documents i have managed to fabricate an application to nato . 
  i leave it up to you whether to use it or not . 
  take that with a grain of salt . 
  these dialects are not totally unintelligible from official italian . 
  maybe sardinian would be the true exception . 
  [ is that so ? 
  ] ( http://www.alva.org.uk/details.cfm?p=423 ) the top visited attractions in the uk are its museums . 
  never met anyone who wanted to visit the uk because of the monarchy . 
  which in any case , you can rarely `` see '' . 
  buckingham palace which apparently is not in that list looks like it averages 400k visitors per year , which would place it around the 80th place . 
  thanks , but no thanks . 
  a * caesar * , on the other hand ... 
  well ... according to this recent [ poll ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/210956/belief-creationist-view-humans-new-low.aspx ) belief in creationism in the us is at 38 % . 
  and it is regarded as a new `` low '' . 
  their argument was that if m5s had won the mayoral race , they would have had the national and regional governments against ( as they are pd governments ) . 
  she claimed that the government would have decreased funding with the intent of `` making them look bad '' as they would n't be able cope with these insurmountable challenges . 
  senator taverna from the m5s party in the rome mayoral elections said that there was a [ conspiracy ] ( http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/02/16/news/comunali_l_ultima_dei_cinquestelle_c_e_un_complotto_per_farci_vincere_a_roma_-133548559/ ) to make them win so that they could be humiliated by their ineptitude . 
  m5s won and they have showed they really were inept . 
  i agree with the unstable political system but to say that italy has zero economic potential it 's an exaggeration , c'mon !, 
  despite decades of mismanagement italy is still the 3rd economy in the eu . 
  finally , right ? 
  i 'm waiting for alfa romeo to produce an electric car . 
  it has to * look good * too . 
  i do n't trust tesla to come up with an aesthetically pleasant design , at least if compared to the alfa romeo designers . 
  maybe they were the same guys who wrote the gospels , especially the parts where jesus speaks or thinks by himself ... 
  how can you conflate ~ ~ pagan ~ ~ hellenistic romans with christian romans ? 
  imho they were completely different cultures . 
  the fate of europe changed when constantine had a hallucination dooming the empire . 
  only ~ ~ pagan ~ ~ hellenistic roman empire kids will get this . 
  in italy , with the current electoral law , if the party that has the most votes , has more than 40 % they will have a `` majority award '' , which grants them 55 % of the seats ( but only in the lower house iirc ) . 
  so if they manage to win 40 % they would form a government but might not have the majority in the senate . 
  however , right now they ( pd and m5s ) are neck and neck at around 29 % . 
  what i fear the most is that at the last moment m5s could form a coalition with the other right-wing parties , like salvini 's northern league , berlusconi 's `` remnant '' and other ultra-right wing party . 
  by betraying their voter base ( ? 
  or perhaps fulfilling what they desire ) they would have the numbers to govern . 
  it is still possible that the pd could win more votes too but they would be in a similar situation . 
  there 's a splinter party that recently seceded from the main party , but they currently stand at around 3-4 % . 
  it would n't be enough . 
  they could ally with berlusconi but that 's not palatable .
