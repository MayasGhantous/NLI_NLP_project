  they want to change the electoral law yet again , so we 'll have to see . 
  during the summer gallipoli becomes the capitol of sin & vice in puglia ( in a good way ) . 
  they might get the most votes , but it is highly unlikely they will have more than 40 % . 
  they 'd have to ally with some other right-wing party . 
  and they said they wo n't . 
  flags with hands , feet , mouths ? 
  oh the horror !, 
  a political union would have a common and unified response . 
  a loose treaty relies on the goodwill of each member country . 
  to ... # * make america great again * #, 
  that 's correct !, 
  are you doing your part ? 
   it goes without saying that these brits in europe are going to generally be wealthier and better placed to remain in europe after brexit than the 916,000 polish people alone for example that currently live in the uk . 
  why ? 
  because the british are * by nature * more intelligent or better at life than the polish ? 
  because they are * expats * while the polish are * migrants * ? 
  my girlfriend just came home after a gp appointment . 
  since she is european , and the doctor had a spanish wife they ended up talking about brexit . 
  the doctor said he and his spanish wife voted leave * `` because germany takes all our money '' . 
  * good luck for him and his # 350 million more . 
  out of curiosity what happens in case of a hard brexit in the game ? 
  is there a mass repatriation of eu players that do not qualify for a work permit ? 
  i planned to live in the uk long term , buy a house , etc. 
  i work at a university . 
  the future is in europe now . 
  you do n't * have to * buy health insurance . 
  i assume you would simply show your ehic and it would be taken care of . 
  the mods ( ? ), 
  just posted a picture of pinochet saying that that 's what `` france needs '' ... 
  everybody on / r/t _ d maybe . 
  those tabloids also have websites too . 
  and on social media it all becomes an echo chamber . 
   iceland wiki claims the new government will hold a referendum to resume accessions negotiations . 
   norway , is in the eea and has freedom of movement . 
   switzerland is in efta and has freedom of movement . 
   most countries in the world are not in the eu . 
  most countries in * europe * either are already in the eu or * want to be in the eu . 
  * of the rest , you 'll be joining belarus and russia . 
  and i think that 's it ? 
  less extreme ? 
  leaving the eu is the most extreme action you could take . 
  like america and public welfare then . 
  stereotype much ? 
  it boggles the mind how * despite all that * , italy is still among the top 10 global economies . 
  what 's their secret ?!? 
  they should be thankful they do n't have the crusader kings 2 algorithm giving them titles . 
  it 's amazing to think that the uk has even an `` opt-out '' from catholicism !, 
  brexiting before it was cool . 
  imagine if you end up instead with * internal * passport controls . 
  ie between ni and ruk , to enable a free travel area between the republic and ni . 
  so belgium would have to leave the eu just because of a decrease in trade with the uk ? 
  wow , * that escalated quickly . 
  * implying that outside the eu it would be able to have * more * negotiating power ? 
  a * global belgium * needing * strong and stable leadership * for a * black , yellow and red bexit !, 
  * i can totally see it . 
  but that is formally called [ `` the efl championship '' ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/efl_championship ) not the * champion 's league . 
  it sounds like your team did n't get very far in the ucl !, 
  the franco-iberian civ in sid meier 's beyond earth had the fall of the eu in its back story . 
  main reason i could n't get into that game . 
  could n't identify with that ... 
  it 's more likely that switzerland will join the eu . 
  italy 's constitution doesn '' t allow referendums on foreign policy . 
  queen amidala ? 
  doubtful . 
  he might get the most votes , but they wo n't be enough to form a government . 
  all of italy ? 
  it 's a term used to mean the common themes shared by both , not a specific type . 
  it 's used in italian historiography . 
  what happened ? 
  i left it this morning at a few dozens comments and now it 's more than 1000 ? 
  awesome , right ? 
  if m5s wins they would n't be able to form a government on their own . 
  there 's hope . 
  it 's not just about the ideas , but the mindset . 
  their supporters always say `` we '' , `` us '' , `` our '' . 
  they support their party as if it were a football team . 
  for the most radical m5sers it 's almost a cult . 
  there are n't that many lega nord voters around . 
  since some m5s party officials are sane , voting for the m5s allows those who would like ln 's policies to not feel ashamed . 
  their pm candidate just went full retarded recently ... 
  it 's so funny reading what they are saying in the equivalent thread over there . 
  ca n't wait for the second round !, 
  i am sure they will drop him on the 9th of june . 
  west empire best empire . 
  this is an actual thing ? 
  wow !, 
  til romania worships the grecoroman pantheon . 
  praise jupiter !, 
  i guess they want to retain their perceived superiority . 
  a united eu would be too big to compete with . 
  what was the kindest thing you heard them say about the european * project * , besides the economic aspects ? 
  so the counter-argument would be that since italy ( or people who lived in what is now italy ) created so much art , it should be distributed all over the world ? 
  maybe they could come up with their own art !, 
  that would be a great way to solve it !, 
   does it mean the shroud ought to go back to chamb\u00e9ry ? 
  i would n't be that proud of a forgery . 
  if it was up to me you could have it back !, 
  as said in another part of the thread , axum 's obelisk was returned to ethiopia in 2008 . 
  so i guess it would not be out of the question . 
  do n't you think that it would be fairer to have these artworks reside where the artists have lived and worked ?
