  some of them were stolen by napoleon . 
  how would you feel if in order to see a significant part of french impressionists ' paintings you had to go abroad ? 
  let 's also throw the british into the mix : please return the parthenon marbles to greece !, 
  * because it 's the right thing to do . 
   win a war against france and maybe you can get something returned . 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  the eu should settle the issue someday . 
  that maybe is not a good example , but there are other [ artworks ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/furti_napoleonici ) that were actually stolen during the napoleonic period . 
  at least , france ( and all the other museums that have italian artwork ) are usually not very far away . 
  italy did give back the [ axum obelisk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/obelisk_of_axum ) , for example . 
  there 's an office of the italian government whose [ mission ] ( http://www.esteri.it/mae/en/politica_estera/cultura/recuperooperearte.html ) is the recovery of stolen artwork . 
  you could argue that some artworks [ stolen ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/furti_napoleonici ) during the napoleonic period ought to be given back . 
  but yes sometimes it pops up in the news , but rarely any progress is made . 
  maybe someday france ( and the rest of the world ) will change their mind . 
  italy would be happy to receive half the louvre 's collection back . 
  [ removed ], 
  i hope the turin zebras will be able to win the ucl next year . 
  a follow-up question . 
  i 'm probably in a very `` european '' situation . 
  i will move to another country ( belgium ) before the end of the year and was considering the possibility of buying a house instead of renting , also because i 'm not getting any younger ... 
  anybody here with a similar intra-european experience ? 
  how likely am i to get a mortgage from a country that does not `` know '' me ? 
  it would be a 5-year fixed-term contract leading on an indefinite one upon `` positive evaluation '' . 
  interesting !, 
  where in the us is that ? 
  i have seen `` focaccia '' used as bread in the uk too . 
  but in italy it can be served with a plethora of toppings , even some non - `` orthodox '' ones not commonly used on pizzas like potatoes . 
  i 'm sure southern italian street food would be a hit . 
  for example : * focaccia : what you call pizza . 
  * panzerotto : like a fried calzone . 
  * rustici : like british pastries but much tastier imho . 
  what about the `` catalonian '' liga ? 
  would barcelona be happy to play in a severely diminished national league ? 
  i mean , which other top teams would play there ? 
  i work at a british university as a lecturer . 
  my research is in virtual reality . 
  bu towards the end of the year i will brexit to europe . 
  after having driven a few automatic rental cars in the us i must say that i now think that there is little point in a manual transmission in a city car , at least . 
  i 'll definitely get an automatic car when i buy my next one . 
  just be sure it is the correct gesture !, 
  a chinese friend thought that the [ `` gesto dell ` ombrello '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bras_d%27honneur ) ( umbrella gesture ) meant `` see you '' . 
  on the other hand i hate that in the uk the `` two '' gesture is an obscene gesture . 
  so many wrong looks when i only wanted a table for me and my girlfriend ... 
  i lived in the uk for six years , then all of a sudden its people decided to backstab europeans like me by leaving the eu . 
  and the bishop of rome is argentine too !, 
  i fear a crusade to retake london and convert the heathens looms nearer each day . 
  i have seen many * friendships * born between italians and spanish , italian and french , italians and greeks , italian and swedish , etc. 
  ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ sense ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ were ^ ^ ^ friendzoned . 
  ** in italian : ** roman calves are beautiful . 
  ** in latin : ** go oh vitellius , with the war sound of the roman god . 
  ** edit : ** oh sorry , i had read with different meanings . 
  that is one of the most known between italian and latin . 
  i remember an earlier thread where somebody predicted [ in the year 2525 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkqfxi8v5fa ) !, 
   been to italy and really hated the food there how is this even possible ?!, 
  i was going to say * puglia * for italy but this is sadly not related at all to the sun and beaches ... * sighs *, 
  what do the people who live close to the german border think ? 
  i 'm doing the dutch course on duolingo . 
  i 'm amazed that the language goes from almost italian ( `` interessante '' as in interesting ) to full-on language of mordor ( `` graag '' ... 
  seriously ? ) . 
  i 'm still waiting for my nazgul . 
  a few come to mind : * weirdly enough baltimore has an italian translation : baltimora . 
  * everyone in italy would read cincinnati as cheen-chennahtee rather than seen - . 
  i think it was founded by italian emigrants ? 
  * i guess most italians would place more emphasis on the second t in atlanta than the locals . 
  i guess it would be weird pronouncing the english names of italian cities when referencing to distinct american towns . 
  for example venice in la. 
  i assume you have tons of romes and naples too . 
  but none of those are famous/big enough to be talked about abroad . 
  i taught myself while playing monkey island 1 during the 90s . 
  the scumm interface showed you verbs . 
  little by little , for example , i learnt what happened if you clicked * take * and then clicked on an object . 
  thank you guybrush !, 
   i 've heard the netherlands , greece , and italy may also be leaning towards independence , which would leave the union severely weakened i would think you know , in this day and age it 's not very difficult to find this information on your own , rather than relying on hearsay . 
  yes there are some fringe voices that would like italy to leave the euro ( if it could be done without leaving the eu itself ) , but that 's what they are . 
  but luckily , italy forbids referendums on foreign policy , so for now , we 're safe , even in case of a cataclysmic m5s win . 
  rent + council tax : 44 % of my net income . 
  no need to thank me , landlord . 
  the eu got them . 
  too late ... they have now been assigned to banana-straightening duties . 
  not really jokes , more like proverbs :  * non c ' \u00e8 2 senza 3 *  there is no 2 without a 3 . 
  if something happened to you twice , it might happen a third time . 
   * in quattro ( 4 ) e quattr ` otto ( 8 ) *  in four and four , eight something that will be done right away . 
   * abbiamo fatto 30 , facciamo 31 *  we did 30 , let 's do 31 we have come all this way , let 's take one more step to finish something properly . 
  * going the extra mile . 
  [ le vent nous portera ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrgcrvbjybe ) . 
  i heard he killed somebody afterwards ? 
  ah . . was present when his girlfriend committed suicide . 
  i 'm sure people who work for the eu have the same wage regardless of their nationality . 
  the eu would pay as many as it can afford . 
  in the south of italy it 's two kisses even between male friends . 
  in rome they say 5 * euri . 
  north : lulea , sweden south : catania ( in europe ) ; absolute south is savannah , ga , usa east : tokyo west : san francisco highest : might probably be the st. gotthard pass . 
  not just the tunnel , but several hundreds meter towards the actual pass . 
  what ? 
  as a poor southerner , driving to the north of italy for the first time i had never seen the tunnel . 
  everybody in the south knew that you had to go to the `` st. gotthard pass '' . 
  now , picture this : you have a huge tunnel in front of you ( which does n't have any sign , at least it did n't have any 10 years ago ) . 
  then , you have a sign that says `` st. gotthard pass '' pointing to your right . 
  where do you go ? 
  ** right ** of course .
