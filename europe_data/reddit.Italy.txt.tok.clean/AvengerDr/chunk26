  when i started seeing ice , a refuge bungalow , and after being unable to go faster than with the first gear i realised my terrible mistake . 
  that 's not the same . 
  it would be like advertising a `` diavola '' ( or calabrese ) pizza using pepperoni salami instead of a specific type of italian spicy salami . 
  putting pineapple on pizza is simply blasphemous ( i have tasted it and it 's ... okay , there are worse offenders , like pizza with sushi ) but it does n't use the name of other established pizza types like margherita , capricciosa , 4 formaggi , etc. 
  while using different ingredients . 
  then again , very often pizzas outside italy do not use mozzarella and replace it with cheddar for example . 
  then yes , suddenly it 's not pizza any more . 
  the point being that if you change the original recipe , please change the name of the recipe as well . 
  then we 're all friends again . 
  if you want to prepare spaghetti with cream , do n't call it `` carbonara '' , call it something else . 
  it might have been that way during the 90s , the golden age of berlusconi 's milan . 
  if you turn on the tv now , you 'll have a hard time finding milan in the european stage . 
  maybe next year . 
  but i was talking more about the kind of visceral hate people in italy feel for juventus . 
  of course foreigners might care less for a team from another nation . 
  just the names of the continents or the countries in each ? 
  most `` high-schools '' in italy teach latin and latin literature . 
  as students we had to read and translate to/from latin . 
  you can of course continue studying it at the university level . 
  i am a juventus supporter so take this with a grain of salt . 
  they never did buy any match . 
  that is , they never made deals with other teams to fix the result of a match . 
  what they have been charged of is to have [ `` exerted unduly pressure '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_italian_football_scandal ) on the referees and on the people who assigned them to the various matches . 
  they ( the juventus managers who did this , not the coach ) were hoping to get favourable referees . 
  while what they did is of course wrong , i am not sure how it actually materialised during the games . 
  i do n't even think the team juventus had at the times needed any sort of help as it was so successful . 
  * `` you won because you had help !, 
  '' * i hear you say . 
  but . . we had many star players at the time ( ibrahimovic , del piero , trezeguet , half the italian team who won the world cup . . just check the [ 2006 squad roster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005%e2%80%9306_juventus_f.c._season#squad_information ) ) . 
  anyway what 's done is done . 
  however , juventus always had this * stigma * around them before the scandal , and still today after it . 
  therefore many other fans would rather die than see juventus win the champion 's league . 
  it 's not uncommon to see accusations of being `` gufi '' ( owls ) thrown at each other , because the non-juventus fans will be actively supporting the team playing against juventus . 
  juventus ' motto is `` fino alla fine '' which means `` until the end '' . 
  juventus opposers mock it by saying `` fino al confine '' which means `` until the ( italian ) border '' . 
  meaning that they are only able to win in italy because they have outside help , which ends as soon as they play in europe as juventus ca n't buy their way out . 
  there 's no national pride in juventus ' international successes . 
  even though they have one of the teams with the highest number of italian players at the top level . 
  inter , napoli , and others have frequently fielded teams with no italians in the starting eleven . 
  it 's something instinctive . 
  as a juventus fan i hope the other teams get their act together and copy juventus ' model ( they have their own stadium for example ) . 
  we need more italian teams back again at the top . 
  the economic and performance difference between juventus and the other italian teams is becoming huge to the point that serie a from being better than the epl is becoming a league where there 's little to no competition . 
  how else is italy going to win its fifth world cup without a competitive juventus side ? 
  must be juventus fc !, 
  i do n't think the team is that hated outside italy as it is within the country . 
  italy is a long country , geographically . 
  therefore flights from the very south to the very north are very popular : e.g. , from bari/brindisi to milan or even rome . 
  there 's a big north-south infrastructure divide in terms of railways especially . 
  the high-speed train only runs between milan-naples , then it 's back to regular speed . 
  i think milan-bari ( around 900km ) is around 7hr30 by train ( used to be slower before the frecciarossa ) and 9h by car . 
  flying is thus the cheapest and fastest route to cross italy top to bottom or vv . 
  ( usually 50 $ milan-bari ) it 's also the most practical route from the two islands to anywhere on `` continental '' italy . 
  i guess the shorter routes ( e.g. 
  brindisi roma ~ 500km 5-6 + hrs by car ) might die down once the high speed train connects everything in the south . 
  but there 'll always be a market for north-south flights i guess . 
  at least until the hyperloop !, 
  for a moment i asked myself `` where are the uk ones ? '', 
  \\* * sighs * \\*, 
  you could apply the same reasoning on any scale , as big or as small as you wish . 
  otherwise you would n't have situations like london vs everybody else in the uk . 
  you too have abortions legal in the uk but not in northern ireland , which is part of the uk . 
  there would need to be a common platform , and those problems you say would be faced at a federal level . 
  that has always been the dream and i still maintain it should be the goal . 
  not today , not tomorrow but someday not too far off . 
  i do n't think it will come as drastic change but a series of small steps . 
  i think we 'll truly have a federation when there will be pan-european elections , rather than compartmentalised european elections . 
  i just imagined portlandian partisan brigades resisting californian occupation . 
  or would they ? 
  i have always wondered why he did n't undergo a hair transplant . 
  i mean surely with all his money he could have access to the ** best doctors ** and the ** best treatments ** . 
  he could have the ** the best people ** working for him . 
  it 's amazing . 
  antonio conte was almost bald , and look at him today . 
  at the same age you tell them that god is n't real . 
  [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tot%c3%b2 ) . 
  that 's really hardcore !, 
  i 'm as italian as it gets but i have only once in my life seen a person actually making pasta . 
  and it was a token demonstration for tourists who think italy is exactly like the one they portray in the commercials . 
  then again , yout flair checks out !, 
  one of your countrymen once asked me : * `` do you also have pasta in italy ? 
  that 's dangerously close to the italian word * panzana * which would mean * an extraordinary lie * . 
  this really surprised me . 
  i thought him and bud spencer & terence hill movies were only known in italy . 
  i never imagined they would dub them . 
  have you ever watched any movie from tot\u00f2 ? 
  older b&w comedies from the fifties and later . 
  what about president stephen hawking ? 
   they bring in money from tourism this is just a myth . 
  before moving to the uk i have been a tourist there . 
  my opinion is shared by all the people i know who have visited england or at least london . 
  none of us visited london because of your monarchs . 
  they rather hinder tourism rather than attract tourism . 
  why ? 
  because they actually live in palaces that would otherwise be interesting to visit . 
  everybody i know has taken a selfie at buckingham palace . 
  nobody i know even tried to get inside . 
  on the other hand i know people who went to versailles or to the royal palace in caserta ( naboo ) . 
  what do these sites have in common ? 
  no royals anymore !,
