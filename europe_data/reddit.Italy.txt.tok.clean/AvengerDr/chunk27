  i have been to holyrood but that 's just because they are seldom there . 
  if you go and check the most visited sites in england , you 'll find that people come there for the museums or attractions that have nothing to do with the monarchy . 
  the first two are extremely common . 
  the only italians that i think would call americans yankees are hardcore communists from 20-30 years ago . 
  in italy ? 
  definitely catholicism . 
  of course i meant related to its origin . 
  how could you desecrate the legacy of decimus maximus meridius in such a way ? 
  he died for you too !, 
  italians probably feel more connected to the roman empire because they are the closest people related to it , at least in a geographical sense . 
  while everyone in the former roman territories could feel some kind of emotiobal attachment to it , they are often more proud of their opposition to it . 
  the germans built a statue to the traitor ariminius ffs !, 
  you are right , rome was an idea . 
  who knows where we would be as a civilization if it was n't for the treachery of constantine . 
  not / s. 
  i 'm confident social progress would have lead the empire back to its republican roots sooner or later . 
  on the eve of the vote , i was eyeing a job position in the us . 
  i thought to myself `` let 's wait tomorrow '' . 
  * nope . 
  as an italian , i am of course the sole depositary of truth when it comes to food and cooking . 
  / s for barbarians lunch is between 13 and 14 , earlier sometimes because the heathens have not seen the light and they schedule meetings at 13 . 
  may their souls find peace . 
  dinner is  20 . 
  as i speak it 's 21 and i 'm starting to cook now . 
  needless to say i 'm taking names to tip off the italian food police . 
  i teach an introductory maths unit at the university level in the uk . 
  sometimes students tell me they have n't done any maths in the last five to ten years . 
  they ca n't be much older than 20 years old if they are at their 2nd year of university . 
  how is this at all possible ? 
  in italy everyone does maths , sure with different degrees of success . 
  but it is n't possible to drop it altogether . 
  you do maths if you choose classic studies as a secondary school , or even if you go to some technical schools . 
  i ca n't comprehend how it is possible to go to university while not knowing what a fraction is and how to solve basic first degree equations . 
  i have been several times in the us . 
  recently i have been in grenville , sc . 
  from london i 'd have had to catch another flight from charlotte , nc . 
  so i thought `` i 'll just get the direct flight to charlotte and then a train to greenville . '', 
  the only train looked like a freight train at 2.30 am . 
  how is it possible that a country that pioneered railroads fell so behind ? 
  i took the greyhound bus ( and a bus from the airport to the terminal ) . 
  it was ... interesting to say the least . 
  it was exactly like in the movies . 
  i can see how people who have money will fly and those `` who have nothing to lose '' will take the coach . 
  there were people with insanely long receipts , which i assume meant they were travelling from some very distant place . 
  maybe it was an unfortunate coincidence , but some people who were travelling with me did n't look like they were `` right in the head '' . 
  there was a mute person who at some point emerged from the bathroom with an empty pill container , and people thought he wanted to kill himself . 
  others looked like they had with them everything they owned in their life . 
  but from a transportation point of view it surprised me that nobody was in a hurry . 
  the coach stopped in some kind of service station so that people could go to get food . 
  i guess it makes sense when distances are so huge . 
  it is useless to save a few minutes when the journey will take hours or days . 
  the final stop in greenville was miles outside the city centre . 
  i got to see the peachoid from house of cards on the way :d greenville however was okay . 
  it felt very european . 
  i then rented a car and visited savannah , charleston , and atlanta . 
  nothing bad happened to me but people warned me in atlanta . 
  charleston was fine . 
  savannah was mostly okay in the city centre but outside i felt uneasy . 
  similarly , approaching cities like chicago or baltimora it feels like you are in some third world country devasted by war . 
  abandoned buildings , mess everywhere . 
  then you get to the centre and it 's all shiny and luxurious . 
   filer \u00e0 l'anglaise ( leave the english way ) : leave without telling anybody ironically in italian it 's `` andarsene alla francese '' !, 
  * editto bulgaro * - `` bulgarian edict '' . 
  popularised after a berlusconi declaration about the use of public tv while he was in sofia . 
  it indicates an imposition from above , typical of dictatorial regimes . 
  * fare il portoghese * - `` behave like a portuguese * . 
  not paying . 
  * fare l'indiano * - `` behave as an indian '' . 
  feigning ignorance or acting as if you do not understand something . 
  i think it might be referring to native americans though . 
  * inglese falso e cortese * - `` englishman is false but polite . '', 
  to be fair , this can be said of a lot of different nouns indicating inhabitants of a country or city ( italian ones too ) that end in '' - ese '' . 
  the most popular is `` torinese/piemontese '' i think . 
  * - `` mom , the turks are coming . '', 
  i think it originates from the times of the saracen pirate incursions . 
  * cose turche * - `` turkish stuff '' , events or ( sexual ) acts out of the ordinary . 
  * per me e ' arabo * - equivalent of `` it 's all greek to me '' , with arab in place of greek . 
  perhaps because we historically have studied greek ? 
  * zio d'america * - `` american uncle . '', 
  crazy expat relative ( often american ) who comes back full of money . 
   our flag does not give away that maple syrup is our thing ? 
  try putting the jar/bottle in the middle next time !, 
   how do you warm up your leftovers . 
  do n't tell me you fire up the oven just for that ? 
  well in general i tend to cook just as much as i eat . 
   did you just say maple syrup is an american thing ? 
  well people are not commonly introduced to it , as it is not used in any typical italian recipe . 
  you might get to know it if you pay close attention to american movies where there are people who are eating it in diner scenes and so on . 
  that 's how i think people associate it with the us . 
  you need somebody who has actually visited north america to understand the difference . 
   nutella is consumed here a lot too and is seen as a `` canadian '' thing . 
  perhaps because there is a canadian plant . 
  but the company who produces it , ferrero , is italian . 
   how do you not own a microwave ? 
  i never felt any need for it . 
  i 'm italian !, 
  :d i cook a pasta dish almost every day . 
  for meats and other food , i either use a grill pan or the oven . 
   what 's your favourite type of cheese ? 
   moz ** z ** arella ** triggered ** you ca n't put mozzarella in the same league with hard/soft cheeses .
