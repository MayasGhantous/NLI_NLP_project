  it 's something else . 
  unless you 're unfortunate enough to live in a place where they pass [ these ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.caloriecount.about.com/images/medium/organic-valley-mozzarella-cheese-116690.jpg ) [ revolting ] ( http://img.tesco.com/groceries/pi/991/5053947817991/idshot_540x540.jpg ) [ blasphemies ] ( http://img.tesco.com/groceries/pi/996/5053526877996/idshot_540x540.jpg ) as mozzarella . 
  this is true [ mozzarella ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/mozzarella#/media/file:mozzabuffala_2.jpg ) . 
  italy here : * ** peanut butter ** is seen as an `` american '' thing , like maple syrup . 
  people here prefer nutella , which is seen as more `` local '' . 
  * ** jams : ** i 'm not a fan personally * ** ready-to-eat : ** i do n't own a micro-wave , but i am a bit wary of that kind of food . 
  i prefer to cook for myself . 
  at the most , i would buy food that you can cook by putting it in the oven , like breaded chicken , and so on . 
  * ** breakfast : ** i usually eat strawberry yogurt mixed with cereal hoops and , of course , coffee . 
  that is , an espresso . 
  * ** beverages : ** just water and orange juice . 
  * ** pasta : ** i buy dry or fresh pasta , i never prepared it myself . 
  but i do cook every sauce from scratch . 
  * ** alcohol : ** red wine and white beer . 
  i moved to the uk 5 years ago now . 
  i now feel like i do n't want to be `` left behind '' here in the uk . 
  i am looking for options to go elsewhere in the continent , but it wo n't be easy . 
  as an alternative abbreviation , i remember a handy four letter acronym we could use : [ ** s.p.q.r. 
  ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_empire#/media/file:roman_empire_trajan_117ad.png ) here 's hoping it catches on again !, 
  as someone who travels in europe regularly , i love the concept of the euro . 
  it makes you feel part of a huge nation . 
  last year i went from london to paris , then bruxelles , then amsterdam . 
  four countries , three of which have the same currency . 
  this would have been unthinkable in the past . 
  please do n't let them force us to go back to how it was . 
   swedish hawaiian  classic my heart ... 
  but they never had to run for elections . 
  i 'd have more respect for them if they won their office fair and square . 
  source ? 
  how do you know ? 
  no because if that were the case ( if they had any real power ) , people would probably have got rid of them long ago . 
  even though they may not hold any real power ( it varies from country to country , though ) , the principle of the monarchy is still wrong and can not be excused by any rational argument ( even if the only reason for would be that they bring money through tourism , which is dubious , as described elsewhere in the thread ) . 
  knowing this , i was interested to learn which country is likely to dissolve its monarchy in the near future . 
  out of the bunch it seems spain or catalonia are the most likely to . 
  why would it be ? 
  `` ti voglio bene '' , it means that `` i care for you '' . 
  it would be translated in english as `` i love you '' . 
  but in italian it does n't mean the same thing ( i love you is `` ti amo '' ) . 
  it 's the non-romantic `` i love you '' that you might say to your parents or friendzoned friend . 
  it sounds like you never went to southern europe . 
  italy is pretty crazy about fedez . 
  he 's also a `` judge '' on the italian x-factor . 
  i understand members of the elite who support the monarchy . 
  i can not explain the thought process or the mindset that makes somebody with no interests in the institution of the monarchy , want to support something like the monarchy . 
  it 's like you are explicitly admitting that in this world there are some who through birthright deserve to be better than you . 
  i 'll never be able to understand that . 
  subjunctive . 
  people who get this wrong end up using the conditional instead of the subjunctive . 
  for example instead of `` se volessi '' ( if [ i ] wanted to '' ) they might say `` se vorrei '' ( if [ i ] would want ) . 
  in italian this has the same effect of * scraping a chalkboard with fingernails . 
  * just thinking about it i get a headache . 
  but most people do n't realise it when they do this mistake . 
  case in point : di maio ( italy 's m5s candidate for pm ) at a recent speech getting his subjunctives [ wrong ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnpthlmjbsg ) . 
  the man behind who smiles is m5s ' di battista , another candidate `` in waiting '' . 
  another difficult area is the use of the `` h '' in the verb `` to have '' . 
  there are words that have a similar sound ( but not exactly the same ) but different meaning if they are prefixed by `` h '' . 
  for example `` ho '' ( i have ) vs `` o '' ( or ) ; `` hanno '' ( they have ) vs `` anno '' ( year ) . 
  however this error is more apparent in writing . 
  it 's similar to their/they 're , your/you 're . 
  it 's different . 
  in theory i could become president . 
  i will never be able to become a monarch . 
  for example , bill clinton , before becoming president , was not from a particularly rich family . 
  i just oppose the fact that queens and kings never have to face public scrutiny . 
  that is what i find fundamentally wrong . 
  maybe in the uk it 's a bit different . 
  the members of the house of lords have * some * powers , and are appointed . 
  there are even members of the church in the house of lords . 
  however as a republican in the uk , i do not tolerate that my taxes are used to support their family , nor that the bbc uses my money to run completely biased stories about them . 
  the bbc journalists are not impartial , they always assume that everybody is okay with the concept of the monarchy . 
  i 'd much prefer if the stories were more of the `` happy couple has wedding '' , `` woman has child '' variety . 
  during that time , i think the guardian had a special `` republican '' version of their website which automatically hid those news stories :d i pay the same taxes as many other british citizens , but i do not feel my views matter here . 
  do not mistake this as some sort of resentment against the british . 
  i shake my fist at the sky every time i see the pope on italian tv . 
  well , i have been in athens recently . 
  in front of the parliament , they have a changing of the guard ceremony , with equally silly hats and an equally silly dance routine . 
  there were lots of tourists there observing it . 
  i doubt it would change if the royal guards became presidential guards . 
  they are still born into privilege , and in principle it is still wrong even if they hold no power . 
   why are you a die-hard republican , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  interesting question . 
  i think it 's because i like lost causes !, 
  on a more philosophical note , to paraphrase obama , i think monarchies are on the * wrong side of history * . 
  if there has been a movement to improve people 's rights and liberties , then i believe republicanism should be part of that . 
  i know they 're harmless and have little power . 
  that does n't mean the concept is still wrong . 
  why can not they continue as kings and queen in private , and let somebody who could represent their country because of their accomplishments become head of state ? 
  if it is a ceremonial role , then you could have an artist , a scientist , a writer , etc. 
  iirc ireland 's president is a poet . 
  they monarchs themselves could run for office . 
  i am not advocating guillotines and exile . 
   as far as i 'm aware italy does n't have a monarchy anymore , so it strikes me as odd that you 're so passionate about how other countries choose to govern themselves . 
  but no country , that i know of , ever chose to govern themselves through a monarchy . 
  it came to be because those families imposed themselves centuries ago . 
  they are just accepting the status quo , but i would n't call it a choice . 
  40 % is quite significant , though . 
  i thought republican support was on par with the other northern european monarchies . 
  i also read that queen letizia is ( was ? ), 
  a [ republican ] ( http://europe.newsweek.com/spains-queen-letizia-divorcee-war-reporter-tv-journalist-republican-271035?rm=eu ) ? 
  wow , perhaps he wanted to press his claim to the throne !,
