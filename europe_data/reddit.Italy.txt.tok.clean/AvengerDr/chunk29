  but is that an argument that justifies not tackling all types of inequalities ? 
  should we pick and choose the inequalities to address ? 
  i could become a president . 
  i will never become a monarch , if i am not born from the right mother . 
  imagine if william turns out to be worse . 
  harry for king !, 
  i do n't hate anyone . 
  i know that they are mostly harmless nowadays . 
  it 's just that i can not reconcile that with the fundamental principle that `` all men are born equal '' . 
  well , if for a moment you would consider a [ biased source ] ( https://republic.org.uk/what-we-want/monarchy-myth-buster/its-good-tourism ) they claim a different story . 
  looking at the [ visitor numbers ] ( http://www.alva.org.uk/details.cfm?p=423 ) , only two sites in the top 10 have something to do with the monarchy . 
  the fact is that the top british attractions ( museums ) are free to visit , hence why they do not appear to generate revenue . 
  start charging , and they would eclipse the royal sites ( please do not start charging !, 
  but are you sure about tourism ? 
  i have never heard any of my friends saying `` i 'm going to london for the queen '' . 
  indeed , you 'll find that most tourists will have to stop at the gates . 
  if there was no monarch , it is conceivable that many royal palaces would become open to the public . 
  people did n't stop visiting versailles or the royal palace in caserta ( naboo ) because there is no monarch anymore . 
  they probably could n't if there was still a monarch . 
  yes , sorry as i said , i meant it as a figure of speech , hence the quotes , not actual subservience . 
  what does man and kvinnor mean ? 
  do you have heirs lined up to last up to the end of the 21st century ? 
  thanks , i did n't know they were still around . 
  perhaps a good old fashioned duel or jousting tournament could be used to establish who 's the right pretender ? 
  yes , hence the use of quotes . 
  i meant it as a figure of speech , rather than actual subservience . 
  same here , we have a monarchic party , which also scored below 0,1 % . 
  the current savoy `` heir '' , emanuele filiberto , was a candidate in the 2008 general elections and at the 2009 european elections , but he was never elected . 
  until some years ago , the male members of the former royal house , were banned from coming back to italy , due their behaviour in ww2 . 
  `` fika '' in swedish means `` taking a break/coffee '' iirc . 
  in italian it 's very close to the slang word to describe female genitalia !, 
  i live in the uk but after they broke my heart , i 'm hearing the sirens of the motherland . 
  now i would n't mind going back to an italian city like milan , turin , florence , or even rome . 
  realistically it will probably somewhere else in northern europe . 
  bruxelles felt like it had a good international vibe . 
  the united kingdom ? 
  in public , if you know italian well , you 'd have no doubts that he is from that region . 
  but he speaks italian , he does n't speak the way someone talking in tuscan dialect would . 
  he does n't drop the c , and he does n't put `` un `` s everywhere . 
  maybe in private ? 
  on the other hand , people in italy , especially the m5s crowd , ridicule him because he does n't speak english [ very well ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6e-zozswmo ) . 
  well at least he tries ... 
  it has to be the [ biowashball ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=it&amp;v=v2w7avgqpec&amp;hl=it ) . 
  introduced in italy by beppe grillo ( the grey eminence behind italy 's five star movement , when he was still a comedian ) . 
  it was portrayed as some sort of miraculous product that would save you a lot of money on washing , that because of some conspiracy ( think big wash ) was n't sold in italy . 
  of course , the product never had the qualities he claimed . 
  well i think the truth is a bit more complex than that . 
  based on what i have seen from living there , it 's just a matter of traditions . 
  the majority of italians are far from being devout practising catholics . 
  if they are not agnostics/atheists , they might have a theistic belief in god or jesus , but it ends there . 
  they might baptise their sons/daughter , do the communion as kids , but they do n't do it because they really believe , but because everybody else is doing it . 
  churches are mostly empty in big cities , it 's the older segment of the population who is more devout . 
  always wondered if people from tuscany can not really pronounce the `` hard-c '' sound in various words or if it is just an act . 
  gallipoli is starting to look like an italian las vegas , but only during the summer . 
  in some railway stations in the uk there 's like a poster saying that the station uses `` the 24-hour clock '' . 
  it amazes me that it is something that needs to be explained . 
  but i grew up with the 24-hour system ... 
  in italy , the 24-hour clock is use d formally , ie tv times , events , opening hours . 
  sometimes even informally , when using the 12-hour click could create ambiguity . 
  there 's no formal am/pm in italian . 
  the word exists but there 's no shorthand used in speech . 
  when using the 12-hour clock we disambiguate by saying `` 8 in the morning '' , `` 3 in the afternoon '' , `` 9 in the evening '' . 
  but only when for example an event could be both in the morning or in the evening . 
  `` see you tomorrow at 9 '' `` wait , morning or evening ? '', 
  i absolutely hate going to sunbathe at the sea . 
  and my girlfriend does too . 
  i consider it a complete waste of time . 
  i usually spend my summer in walking distance of a beach , but i only ever go there to take a swim and go back home . 
  what 's the point of sunbathing ? 
  one of the most famous in italy , in naples particularly , is the `` pacco '' - package . 
  while walking in the city centre , you might be approached by people offering to sell you the latest smartphone , hi-tech gadget , expensive watch , whatever . 
  of course at such low prices it 'd be a steal . 
  literally . 
  they show you the goods : it 's real , it works . 
  they might even let you haggle a bit before conceding to your demands for a discount . 
  then they place it inside a box or package , and with the help of an accomplice , they distract you and swap the package with another one . 
  then , when it 's too late , you discover your package contains a brick or something worthless of equal weight . 
  my father fell for it in the 80s , i think it was either a vcr or a reflex . 
  a few years ago i was driving on the waterfront , there was lot of traffic . 
  two boys on a moped * knocked on our window * to ask if we wanted to buy an iphone . 
  i also once was approached by an italian in a german supermarket parking lot * who wanted to sell us something we 'd be really interested in * . 
  i guess the scam must be still going strong , even in the age of amazon . 
  i mean i understand their ... devotion to their royals , but it would be really sad to ignore everything else that could represent the country . 
  oh well , i hope myself and farage are still alive to see these future euro coins :d,

  please do n't make boring euro coins by stamping the face of king charles on everything when you eventually rejoin the eu . 
  show some originality !, 
  i think if we can survive through the next round of elections without losing france or italy to the populists , the future might be brighter , for european integration . 
  once the main obstacle to it is removed ( the uk ) and the danger of further breakaway states postponed idenfinitely , things like a eu army , or fiscal union might actually go ahead . 
  i think ukraine will join someday . 
  maybe the kingdom of england and wales will too , if scotland does n't veto it . 
  religious indoctrination of minors . 
  explain first how much `` freer '' you feel . 
  is it the guns ? 
  must be the vatican . 
  [ september the 20th ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capture_of_rome ) best day of my life . 
  of course yes !, 
  with a basic requirement of at least 1 year of residency . 
  if you live there , pay the taxes there , why should you not be allowed to vote in their elections ?
