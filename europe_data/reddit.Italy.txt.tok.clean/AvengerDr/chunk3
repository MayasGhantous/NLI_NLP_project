  sounds like you were living in the north . 
  if you lived in the south , especially in families who work in commerce , there 's usually a break between 13-16 .30 so there 's time for a longer lunch . 
   then practically nothing until a huge-ass steak at 21.00 when normal people do n't eat anything heavy anymore . 
  no pasta detected . 
  are you sure you were in italy ? 
   here 's how normal people eat :  -7.30 : hearty breakfast ( coffee , rye bread and porridge )  -11.30 : lunch  -16.00 : dinner  -18.00 : snack ( rye bread , fruits etc. ), 
   -21.00 : evening snack aka . 
  the funny thing is that only in italian hospitals you 'd eat at 11.30-12 . 
  if you 're weird , like if you are a northerner , then perhaps you might eat at 19 , when you get back home . 
  between 16-19 i would usually have a second coffee . 
  so you eat bread for most of the day ? 
  that sounds like prison , bread and water :d i guess we are not normal people . 
  why would you eat something at that time ? 
  do n't you get hungry at 23-24 ? 
  it depends on your lifestyle . 
  since i 'm usually not at home at lunchtime , my main meal is at dinner time . 
  if you eat between 13-14 , then not that much time has passed at 17 . 
  it also would feel weird to eat dinner when the light is still out , at least in italy . 
  since i moved to the uk this caused a lot of social issues . 
  for the life of me , the only way i can get to join friends who want to have `` dinner '' at ungodly hours like 17 or 18 , is to skip lunch entirely . 
  that 's what happened in italy and what people would like to avoid . 
  when m5s started there were some hopes of them being a progressive force . 
  however , they then revealed themselves as a populist intransigent party . 
  at the last elections , bersani ( the then pd leader ) was just short of a majority and appealed to the m5s to form a coalition . 
  in a now `` historic '' streaming they ( m5s ) flatly refused any form of collaboration . 
  that 's when renzi swept in and with the help of center-right parties ( ncd for example ) he formed a coalition . 
  which is also one of the things he is criticised the most , for governing with center-right parties . 
  coalitions might work if the parties have similar ideas , but past italian history showed that more often than not , the smallest coalition party will hold hostage the bigger one . 
  it happened with prodi and rifondazione comunista or with the first berlusconi government and lega nord . 
  they wanted to have two rounds of votes , like in france i think . 
  but now that would make the `` nightmare '' of a m5s-win at the second round a real possibility . 
  so that 's why they want to change . 
  a true proportional representation would make the government impossible since italy is n't a two-party nation . 
  right now i think they are at 35 % pd , 30 % m5s , and the rest split between fi , lega and other fringe parties . 
  balmora was inspired from baltimore , a nearby city in maryland where bethesda is also located . 
  i found out that `` balmora '' is also similar to how some locals pronounced baltimore . 
  w-why would you ? 
  acceptable lunch times are between 13-15 and dinner after 20 . 
  everything else is haram . 
  w-why would you ? 
  acceptable lunch times are between 13-15 and dinner after 20 . 
  everything else is haram . 
  i have been in bethesda , md. 
  this was like ten years ago . 
  i was all like : `` this town has the same name of the makers of morrowind . 
  i wonder if ... '' then i immediately understood why balmora in morrowind had that name . 
  they really lack imagination :d, 
  it is also a very sad consideration of how britons view the eu . 
  is it just for trade and nothing else ? 
  so if they ( the eu ) know you ( may ) think staying in the eu is a good thing , how is that going to help them in the negotiations ? 
  so new uk pm by tomorrow morning ? 
  i wonder who * accidentally * recorded her . 
  * bojo was that you ? 
  we have similar websites in italy . 
  i am not sure if such a phenomenon exists in other european countries . 
  what happens is that people purposefully create facebook pages or websites of fake newspapers with the only intention of fostering disinformation , hate , and racism . 
  for example they publish fake news such as refugees throwing away italian food , or getting paid by the government to loiter around . 
  very few have the intellect necessary to double check if the news is true . 
  luckily some debunking websites have risen . 
  the most recent one is saying that hillary clinton wants to legalise 9 months abortion , based on a comment she said at the last debate . 
  another one criticised renzi for having brought benigni to the white house state dinner , by [ using a picture of mussolini ] ( http://www.butac.it/mussolini-alla-casa-bianca-bufala/ ) together with other people and saying that when he `` went to the white house '' he brought scientists with himself . 
  he never went to the us , the picture was taken at the treccani institute , an italian encyclopedia . 
  the only difference is that in italy there are no newspapers on the scale of the sun that are doing this `` misinterpretation '' . 
  it 's just private individuals , but in the age of social media they still have a very wide reach , if not even greater than newspapers .

  ** kcmsf ** ? lang = eng lol they even have glorious best korea file extensions !, 
  the problem is that the [ circulation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_newspapers_in_the_united_kingdom_by_circulation ) of ~ ~ newspapers ~ ~ trash like the sun , the daily mail , etc. 
  is an order of magnitude greater than other more `` reputable '' newspapers . 
  it 's not hard to understand brexit if the sun sells 1.8 m and the guardian 164k . 
  the problem is that we should n't live on past glories . 
  otherwise we 'd be good from here to eternity . 
  * goes to worship his lares to celebrate the glory of rome *, 
  you know you want it . 
  i 'm hoping this will develop a sort of european english variety , like you have a few distinctions between american , british , australian , nz english , etc. 
  maybe centuries from now , when european and british english will have diverged enough , we 'll be able to undo the great vowel shift and make things right again in the universe . 
  you just proved my point . 
  southern italy is not a specific place . 
  it 's not like `` ethnic '' southerners are less work-oriented than `` ethnic '' northerners . 
  let me see your statistically significant evidence . 
  it would be like me saying that all those who live in the north are racists . 
  maybe some are . 
  maybe some are n't . 
  just like in the south . 
  that is just a bad stereotype . 
  that 's still too many . 
  maybe . . if i go to florida , texas or california , what would i find ? 
  i have never been that far south in the us . 
  have you ever been in europe ? 
  many places use [ floor tiles ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/2005-06-25_tiles_together.jpg ) to cover the pavement , instead of carpet . 
  my home in italy has floor tiles everywhere . 
  i think every place in italy comes with tiles as * default * . 
  an alternative might be to use * parquet * ( wood ) instead , or if you 're rich , marble . 
  tiles have the advantages of being much more hygienic than carpet . 
  they are easy to clean thoroughly . 
  whereas carpet give the illusion ( i would say ) of cleanliness . 
  however you have to use special equipment to * really * clean it . 
  when i first moved to the uk i rented a place that had carpet even in the bathroom . 
  that was a recipe for disaster . 
  the only advantage i have ever heard that carpet has , is that people like it because it is not as cold as tiles would be . 
  are slippers that unpopular ?
