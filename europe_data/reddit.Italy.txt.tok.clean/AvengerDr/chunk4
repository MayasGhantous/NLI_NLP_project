  based on my experience , i 'd say carpet is more common in the anglo-saxon world . 
  whereas , tiles seem to be more popular the more you go south ( in europe ) . 
  well , for example , at some point there were some allegations that * secretly * she was in support of brexit . 
  she did neither confirm nor deny . 
  but by not saying anything , in my perspective , it gave those allegations a bit more credit . 
  other royals made some statements regarding the eu , like [ william ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/16/prince-william-appears-to-signal-support-for-remaining-in-eu ) . 
  so it would n't have been unimaginable that she could have said something . 
  i mean , of course she has political opinions . 
  like when cameron said `` she purred down the line '' , regarding the scottish referendum . 
  silence and inaction can also be strong political statements . 
  e.g. , during the scottish and brexit referendums . 
  but you could also elect people who are not career politicians for a ceremonial head of state . 
  due to the whole hereditary thing , you ca n't be sure whether another monarch in her place could have done an even better job than she allegedly did . 
  maybe we could have . . 
  i do n't know , an election ? 
  to choose the best candidate for the job !, 
  but those are simply privileges of her station . 
  besides being born as a windsor , even you or me , were we monarchs , would have visited tons of place , been patron of charitiies , act as ambassadors , and so on . 
  but that 's not her `` fault '' . 
  she ca n't actually do anything meaningful as she has limited power . 
  in italy it is actually mandatory since a law from 1975 . 
  uk should go for ** hard remain ** instead : * euro * schengen * eu army * becoming a driving force behind euro-federalism * mandatory metrification * driving on the right * replacing carpets with floor tiles * replacing their barbaric hot and cold faucets with a single faucet capable of providing water temperatures between boiling hot and freezing cold * mandatory bidets in bathrooms, 
  so what have been the major accomplishments of her `` career '' ? 
  republic uk contests that . 
  they have published a detailed [ analysis ] ( https://republic.org.uk/sites/default/files/royalexpenses.pdf ) of this issue . 
  avoiding a [ scandal ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/04/spain-king-juan-carlos-scandal ) . 
  well not immediately , but one of the aim of this 2nd referendum would be to rejoin the eu . 
  so , you do n't live in germany ? 
  that might be the only realistic way , though . 
  we already have a subset of countries of the eu , in the eurozone . 
  we just need alien invaders then !, 
  when they rejoin the eu as a new member they 'll have to . 
  orecchiette e cime di rape ( turnip greens ? ), 
  would qualify . 
  the irony is that it is also the most `` representative '' dish from apulia ( in theory ) . 
  before you start a food-jihad , know that i 'm apulian . 
  it would be a much better candidate !, 
  most polluted ? 
  that 's a record my hometown does n't want to share with anybody else ( taranto ) . 
  it depends , imagine we are both applying to the same university position . 
  it 's down to me and the british candidate . 
  even if i had a better curriculum , they would take the british person if all non-brits had to be hired just to fill the holes . 
  exactly . 
  try being an italian abroad while berlusconi was pm . 
  this is awesome !, 
  it would be super useful for a ck2 mods that translated all city and province names with their original roman names , for when you inevitably want to restore the empire . 
  * sheds roman tears * one day ... :d, 
   if you 're a foreigner , you do n't have to care . 
  you can just move back home . 
  that alone makes them a lot less invested in the future of the country . 
  what ?!, 
  and if you have a family here , does n't that make you dependant on the uk 's future ? 
  even if you do n't , what if everything you own is based here ? 
  what if you were born in a war-torn country and you have always been here ? 
  you ca n't just haul ass and leave if you 've spent years here . 
   ` for the state must draw a sharp line of distinction between those who , as members of the nation , are the foundation and support of its existence and greatness , and those who are domiciled in the state , simply as earners of their livelihood there . ', 
   adolf hitler , mein kampf exactly as how [ james o'brien ] ( http://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/james-obrien/james-amber-rudds-speech-echoes-mein-kampf/ ) was saying some days ago . 
  then you 'll also need to ban some british people as well . 
  who knows whether they were * leavers * or * remainers * . 
  maybe they just want to see the world burn . 
  i did n't say it looks like the holocaust . 
  but you have to start somewhere , right ? 
  suggesting firms to draft lists of foreigners , and banning foreign academics are the first bullet points on the to-do list , i suppose . 
   yes , but the uk leaving the eu is not an example of this . 
  if the uk did not leave the eu after the referendum , that would be undemocratic . 
  it depends on how you spin it , no ? 
  not myself personally , but close to half your fellow british compatriots will be stripped of their european citizenship against their will . 
  their opportunities to live , work , and relate themselves with other europeans will be drastically reduced . 
  this seems pretty dystopian to me . 
   i think it is on the right side of history . 
  the whole world told you not do it . 
  except maybe trump and putin . 
   i find this a bit unlikely if we look at the actual examples of countries that have rejected eu membership . 
  the current generation of norwegians and swedes have no regrets that previous generations of norwegians and swedes rejected the eu . 
  i do n't think the uk will be different from them . 
  that 's not a good example . 
  norway and sweden were never into the eu and then left . 
  they are today where they have always been , in the eea the former , and in the eu the latter . 
  sweden is actually in the eu and in schengen . 
  they just need the euro . 
  i think that sooner or later , the external pressure of being surrounded by the eu will push those countries to commit more . 
  a better example would have been greenland , which actually left the eu . 
  still incomparable unfortunately . 
   the people responsible for taking executive actions in our democracy is the government , elected by the people . 
  the government are answerable to the people in an election , not the leave campaign . 
  they could have drafted a proposal and asked for feedback from the government . 
  it would n't have been something set in stone but it would have shed some of the doubts . 
   no - the remain side made lots of lies . 
  remember the punishment budget ? 
  article 50 being triggered the next day ? 
  cameron not resigning ? 
  the recession ? 
  all of these things turned out to be lies . 
  it could be that those were not actually lies , but * warnings * . 
  they all counted on cameron triggering art . 
  50 the very next morning . 
  those warnings might still come to pass when you eventually trigger it in march . 
  in the meantime you can ask google how much the pound is worth . 
  just checked : it 's $ 1.11 !, 
  dammit just yesterday it was it $ 1.14 , and before the referendum it was ~ $ 1.32 .
