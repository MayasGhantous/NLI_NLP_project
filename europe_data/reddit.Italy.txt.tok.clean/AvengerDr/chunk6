  we might have less cultural exchange , especially if it becomes more complicated to visit the uk from the eu or vice versa . 
  there is likely to be a brain-drain and that will have consequences in the long run . 
  there are also increased chances of the uk breaking up as well . 
  but they were all counting on cameron triggering art . 
  50 right away . 
  there was no indication they would stall for a year . 
  why not though ? 
  it 's not like may is at the beginning of a promising political career . 
  she 's 60 , she might win another term and we 'll have to see about that , as the elections will happen in year 1 ab . 
  it would be more like an `` ultimate sacrifice '' for the good of the country . 
  either way , she ( and cameron ) are going down in history as those who saved or ruined the country . 
  which university is this ? 
  yes , you know , the `` in hoc signo vinces '' guy , [ constantine ~ ~ the great ~ ~ the traitor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constantine_the_great ) . 
  also known for building constantinopolis ( instanbul ) . 
  he proclaimed the edict of milan , decreeing tolerance for christians in the empire , and later he himself converted to christianity . 
  towards the end of his reign , he became more of a fanatic and started ordering the destruction of roman temples . 
  did anybody link [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqkzestq0wo ) yet ? 
  what are you . . americans ? 
  you 're barely out of uni and you want to get married that soon ? 
  that 's cool but why did you have to be special and not use the common man 's * gn * ? 
  i bet drawing the tilde takes you more time !, 
  i would say since constantine . 
  only ~ ~ 700bc-300 ~ ~ * 0-1000 auc * kids will get it . 
   there is only one god * cylon red light panning *, 
    di maio  senator palpatine i picture him more like the [ trade federation viceroy ] ( http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/nute_gunray ) :d, 
  and then what ? 
  a mess like virginia raggi 's , but on a national level ? 
  i hope not to wake myself someday in a world where di maio , or worse , salvini , is prime minister * shudders *, 
  head over the other thread about italy and the eu army for some tried and true `` switched sides '' jokes . 
  are n't you supposed to be rooting for asterix or something ? 
  this kind of reasoning brought the uk out of europe . 
  it 's not about him , it 's about the reform . 
  if you do n't agree with the reform , that 's okay . 
  but do n't vote just to spite him . 
  i wish other italians could read this . 
  every fb post even remotely related to him will give you cancer . 
  it looks like everybody hates him . 
  you see ? 
  to use your own words : `` despite being widespread , it 's wrong . '', 
  you ca n't use that to imply what you are meaning , because it 's only apparent to british people . 
  we `` continentals '' do n't think that way . 
  if i read instructions in italy that apply to `` eu '' citizens i would not assume that they apply to all other eu citizens except italians . 
   it 's not that british students are n't eu students , but that they 're applying under british rules as uk citizens , rather than eu rules as an eu member-state citizen . 
  would n't that be discriminating against eu students ? 
  i mean , for as long as the uk is part of the eu , there can not be a set of rules for `` natives '' and a different set for the rest of the eu . 
  the eu army would defend all of the european union countries . 
  saying that it 's not worth fighting for would be like the uk saying it 's not worth fighting over the orkneys , gibraltar , or the falklands . 
  of course they would be obliged to respond . 
  [ it 's called a synecdoche ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/synecdoche ) . 
  the uk is guilty of this too . 
  you can see it everywhere . 
  they have always considered the eu as something else . 
  just today at the university i saw some special instructions for the `` eu '' students . 
  this does n't make any sense , until 2019 at least , the uk is part of the eu , so i do n't get why you use the eu term to differentiate between british and others . 
  when you use the `` eu '' term , what you really mean is '' { eu - uk } '' . 
  but a british student is also an eu student . 
  it might hurt , but the uk \u2208 eu for at least two more years . 
  eu \u2248 europe, 
  * builds more fields of mars *, 
  what ? 
  quanto barbarismo nel thread :d, 
  being in the eu is a great thing for your economy , is n't it ? 
  but the m5s are the only honest people in the country , surely they would have been able to ensure everything would follow the rules . ^ ^ / s, 
  this is really sad . 
  ten years or so ago , i remember they pushed the release date for the lord of the rings , from december to january . 
  in order not to conflict with the yearly italian comedy . 
  they wanted to do the same for tfa , but perhaps public outcry convinced them otherwise . 
  wales should n't hang around england , they 're bad company ... 
  in italy * hockey means hockey * . 
  field hockey is `` hockey su prato '' . 
  england should just secede from the united kingdom . 
  that 'd be the quickest way out from the european union , and the united kingdom of scotland and northern ireland could remain in the eu . 
  everybody wins !, 
  what practical purpose does vetoing this serve ? 
  it 's not like it 's happening tomorrow anyway . 
  was that sarcasm ? 
  if not what kind of dangers do you see ? 
  i think a combined army might save the eu a lot of money , by avoiding duplication . 
  it will also make it more efficient and better prepared to respond to any external threat , rather than 27 individual armies . 
  but then it 'd just become a matter of which country would be more hospitable for our future cockroach overlords . 
  why few , when you could just use one ~ ~ country ~ ~ imperivm . 
  apparently , after conclave [ you can ] ( http://i.imgur.com/beisnak.jpg ) . 
  you could also buy their daughters/sons through favours and force them to marry your heirs , so you can inherit the whole country without any blood being spilled . 
  would n't a combined eu army be in a better position to respond , rather than several individual armies ? 
  the chances that you `` sail into prosperity '' are the same as the uk becoming a new east germany . 
  luckily , there will be an eu army ready to intervene !, 
  but it should n't be an alliance of armies . 
  but a combined army . 
  they should start sending their 20 + diplomats to london to fabricate a kingdom-level claim . 
   what would an eu army even look like ? 
  [ maybe like this ? 
  ] ( https://epthinktank.eu/2013/12/19/european-defence-cooperation-new-impetus-needed/amy-camouflage-uniform-with-flag-on-it-eu/ )  what language would it operate in ? 
  would language barriers cause it to be ineffective ? 
  are you aware that not all nato countries are native english speakers ? 
  it sure seems to work out alright . 
  sure , but it 's pointless . 
  unless their cunning plan is to postpone art . 
  50 indefinitely , there 's only so much they can do until they no longer can veto it . 
  so what is the point of just spiting the nations with which you are going to negotiate , if it is going to happen anyway ? 
  their best result could be postponing it for two more years .
