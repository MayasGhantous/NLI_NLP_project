  [ sexit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h18qbab7lsi ) according to mr farage is sweden 's exit . 
  maybe * scottex * ? 
  now you know how it feels to be advocating the breakup of the european union . 
  if you knew how it feels to be a european , that is . 
  you 're mistaken , [ sexit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h18qbab7lsi ) according to mr farage is sweden 's exit . 
  i guess scotland could be called ... * scottex * ( which in italy is the brand for andrex 's products ) . 
  whereas remaining in a uk outside the eu will ? 
  i agree . 
  the problem at best is that in italy , the supporting environment is not there . 
  things like childcare , maternity cover , paternity leave . 
  not everywhere , but enough to be worrying . 
  i just saw three women wearing burka sitting in the shadows near my house . 
  it 's difficult to say what they were doing but i guess they were n't enjoying the summer temperatures ( i 'm in the south coast of the uk , yes it 's moderately hot ) . 
  they could at least make them white , like the saudi 's . 
  is there a practical or religious reason they have to be black ? 
  maybe it had pineapple ? 
  if so i can understand . 
  to play the devil 's advocate . 
  sometimes i see small kids wearing those . 
  i wonder how much it was a conscious choice on their behalf , and how much it was an imposition from their parent ( s ) . 
  same thing with baptisms . 
  i was n't in a position to express my consent , yet it happened regardless . 
  ideally , greece or spain . 
  but i already had to leave italy for the united kingdom , but after brexit , i 'll have to move again . 
  this begs the question : how did generations of italian kids manage to grow up without using ketchup on pasta and pizza ? 
  you took this life-altering decision based on one pizzeria ? 
  nowadays , at least you can check the reviews first . 
  that 's too much , i ca n't stand it anymore . 
  i must go brew an espresso with my bialetti moka or prepare a * soffritto . 
  is n't tomato sauce or canned even cheaper ? 
  i know the how . 
  i question the why . 
  my heart ... 
  the point is , if you want an additional ingredient in a pizza , you order one which incorporates it . 
  case in point : there are no `` orthodox '' pizzas in italy that list this kind of sauces in their recipe . 
  the assumption is that the various pizza recipes are not the product of mere chance . 
  unless , it 's a * ghettoized * pizza listed to single out the barbarians . 
  usually you can easily spot them as they are called `` americana '' , `` canadese '' , `` tedesca '' , etc. 
  unless you have eaten pizza in naples you have n't lived yet . 
  ketchup with ... pasta ? 
  guys , i 'm taking names here . 
  someday , the italian food inquisition will come talk with you . 
  it depends where you go . 
  in napoli it 's usually thick . 
  in the south ( at least in puglia ) it 's thinner . 
  please return your italian passport at the nearest embassy . 
  when you order take-away pizza in the uk , it very often comes with `` dips '' . 
  why would you need to dip the pizza in a sauce ?!, 
  the horror , when i saw others actually using them ... 
  because the eu has not been established by a force external and alien to europe . 
  it has been built by all of us in europe . 
  saying that you dislike the eu is like saying that you do n't like something we ( europeans ) helped build and that we are proud of . 
  imho . 
  you know this ends with you drunk dialling the eu in the middle of the night , right ? 
  maybe as a novelty item ? 
  kinda like you see old ussr memorabilia at flea markets . 
  i 'm keeping the leaflet the uk gov sent to vote remain . 
  you never know , it might become a collector 's item !, 
  if we can build a probe capable of accelerating up to 0.2 c , it could get there in 20 years , which is not * that * long . 
  if there is a way to send data back , in ~ 4 more years we could know if we need to start building a generation ship !, 
  or you might just send a colony ship whose population are all teenagers !, 
  i do n't know about germany . 
  i moved to the uk after my phd and as a research associate ( post-doc ) i first earned around $ 2000 + p/m when the pound was  # 1.25 some five years ago . 
  it might be true , uk does n't pay that much compared to some other eu countries ( in this field ) . 
  if teaching assistance is considered an extra , it might reach $ 3000 . 
  then it depends who pays you . 
  if you have an eu fellowship , you 're rich !, 
  when i was a marie curie fellow i earned much more than i do now as a lecturer . 
  that should be the salary for a phd fellowship in italy . 
  postdoctoral bursaries ( `` assegni di ricerca '' ) do not pay that much more . 
  next time i will remember to take some !, 
  you need an italian !, 
  i just tried this classic recipe yesterday . 
  ** pasta e lenticchie ** * pasta with lentils . 
  * it should be suitable for vegetarians at least . 
  * ingredients for 2 * * half a carrot * half a celery stick * 1/4 of an onion * 100 gr of lentils * tomato sauce ( `` passata '' ) * extra-virgin olive oil ( of course ) * instructions * dice the onion , carrot , and celery in very small pieces . 
  if you have a small vegetable mixer this cuts down the preparation time by a lot . 
  in a pot , heat the olive oil , then put the vegetables and cook them for a few minutes , at low power/flame . 
  then pour your lentils and tomato sauce , and 3-4 glasses of water . 
  this is the tricky part : depending on what kind of lentils you use , the boiling time might vary . 
  as a rule of thumb it needs to cook between 30-40 minutes in total ( including the next step ) . 
  if you use `` dry '' lentils instead of canned lentils you need to put them in water for 4-5 hours before using . 
  increase the power/flame during this time to a medium level . 
  taste the lentils , when they are soft and tasty ( very scientific ) , you can add salt and bring it to a boil again . 
  then add pasta and cook it until it is * al dente * . 
  you might need to add water to finish cooking the pasta . 
  in order to cook properly the pasta , water must completely cover it . 
  you should use one of those kinds of pasta that are like round hemispheres , so that the lentils can go inside it !, 
  when it is done , you might need to drain a bit of water . 
  it takes some attempts before you know exactly how much water is needed . 
  you can add diced pancetta ( after the vegetables and before the lentils ) if you like . 
  for a tastier version , use hot vegetable broth instead of regular water . 
  you can also add a bit of parmigiano at the end . 
  ** results may vary ** . 
  unpopular opinion : what 's the rationale for including sports in the olympics whose medals are assigned based on the subjective opinions of the judges rather than something that can be unambiguously ( in most cases ) measured such as time , distance , points , a score , etc. 
  when i went there in 2011 , people who had already been there , warned me not to go `` south of mission district '' . 
  does that still apply ? 
  it concerns me that allowing eu citizens to continue staying in the uk is not unanimous . 
  to the 16 % who would rather see us go away , what would you suggest ? 
  rounding us up and putting us up on a train ?
