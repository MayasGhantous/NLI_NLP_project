as i clearly stated covering your face means being unrecognizable , which means that you are a threat to the safety of other individuals since you can commit a crime while remaining unidentified . 
  that 's why * everybody * that covers their faces is a security threat . 
  that 's the reasoning behind the law as well and that 's why i support it , but nice try . 
  also , religion is n't a good reason to make exceptions to security laws , especially in a secular country like italy . 
  the law was specifically created to combat terrorism ( italian terrorism to be exact , nothing to do with islam ) and the 5th article of said law states that it 's forbidden to cover your face in those kinds of places , that makes it a security threat . 
  you do n't get to decide who is and who is n't a security threat after the event has happened . 
  you are n't going to be skiing in the fucking town hall . 
  and she is n't in jail because security threats do n't automatically send people to jail , this time she was removed from the town hall and she got a fine for it . 
  the reason is security , you ca n't access a town hall with your face covered since it is dangerous for someone to be 100 % unrecognizable . 
  * anyone * that enters a town hall with his/her face covered is a security threat . 
  you ca n't go to places like town halls with your face covered , period . 
  she was asked multiple times to remove it and she did n't , she could have just left if she wanted to . 
  i think it has much more to do with money . 
  when a ton of people get their information from social media i do n't know what you would expect . 
  renzi is apparently both an evil genius who 's stealing our money and a loser who ca n't deal with the eu . 
  some dislike is obviously justified since we have had a huge amount of scandals in the past but a lot of people truly * hate * politicians . 
  well how was it taught there ? 
  i know that in italy it 's supposed to be about different religions but at the end of the day it 's controlled by the catholic church . 
  infinite universe does n't mean that everything that can happen happens . 
  there are infinite numbers between 4 and 5 but 3 is n't one of them, 
  i agree with them not being terrorists but the phrase '' the enemy of my enemy is my friend '' is total bullshit . 
  bin laden was an enemy of an enemy too once . 
  this data is about recent graduates , it should n't take into account the people still in school . 
  you say giudo , you write judo . 
  yep , in austria . 
  there is a difference between `` fighting for your country '' in the middle east and defending your country from an invasion . 
  and what if my country is in the wrong ? 
  i have no reason to fight . 
  i think that a lot of people saw it as `` would you fight for your country in some foreign country , for a questionable cause ? '' . 
  if the question was : `` would you defend your country from invasion ? '', 
  the numbers would be much higher . 
  fellow italians do n't seem to give a fuck about war either , cool . 
  actually , it makes sense since tolerance , even of very bad ideas , is intrinsic to liberalism . 
  liberals are n't actively spreading islam , they just want muslims to have the same rights as everybody else , to tolerate is quite different from supporting . 
  what else can they do ? 
  prevent mosques from being built ? 
  kick them out ? 
  prevent them from entering ? 
  remove their freedom of speech ? 
  if they did those things by following the same principle they should do the same with any other conservative ideology , not just islam . 
  it would n't really be liberalism anymore though . 
  those people are usually bilingual though , i 'm not sure that 's where the 5 % is coming from . 
  a lot of people give a fuck about us flags , read the comments under flag burning videos . . 
   the amount of people that choose these kinds of degrees in italy is consistent and probably they did it because they liked the subjects . 
  these degrees are mostly not related to science and maths . 
  i do n't see why this would be limited to italy . 
  it could be that other countries do the same thing but they still have better educational systems but i ca n't really know without any data . 
  i 'm not sure about how you came to that conclusion . 
  there is no reason to believe that , those were two simple policemen doing their everyday job , why not send specialized units ? 
  it was just an id check , they had no idea it was him , they could n't have done otherwise . 
  there are plenty of italians that are n't `` darker '' . 
  there 's too much diversity so we assume everybody is italian unless you are black or asian . 
  they probably do n't like you , that 's why they gave you panettone instead of pandoro . 
  mike pompeo ( trump cia director pick ) said that the proper outcome of a process to snowden should be the death penalty . 
  how are they barbaric ? 
  switzerland is not the us , they 're very different . 
  i hate guns , but i 'm not going to take them away from people that are responsible with them . 
  spanish * and * french ? 
  or just one of them ? 
  french and spanish mandatory ? 
  in my school you could choose between french/spanish/german but we studied only one of those plus english , not three . 
  this is about kids learning german * at * * school * , it is n't about italians being `` too dumb or lazy '' . 
  all you keep repeating is that there is no problem with being unidentified and that it 's ok to cover your face but you never say why . 
  and people ca n't wear ski masks either for the same reason . 
  also , the police was called . 
  what 's the difference between `` gelato '' and `` ice-cream '' ? 
  what are the other types of ice cream ? 
  there are millions of immigrants in italy . 
  jesus man , the vast majority of your comments are you defending the us from `` brainwashed europeans '' and `` anti-americanism '' , and apparently you 've been doing this for years , posting the same links over and over again and sometimes even copying and reposting entire comments . 
  you need to find a hobby or something , your obsession is n't healthy . 
  http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-16-4465_en.htm firearms directive, 
  fun fact : the 5th top post of all time on r/switzerland is a picture of the ( magnificent ) king of sweden . 
  i agree that the situation is n't necessarily `` good '' but in my opinion saying that `` it 's not much better '' is a bit absurd . 
  in many things the situation is * a lot * better , healthcare for example . 
  sure , job security is n't that good but do you really believe that living a region like veneto , with 7.1 % unemployment is n't much better than living in sicily with its 21 % unemployment rate ? 
  i ca n't talk about the situation of the entire north from my anecdotal experience and i 'm not sure what you mean by `` good '' and `` bad '' . 
  the situation is definitely better than in the south , since unemployment in my region is at 7-8 % and youth unemployment is at around 19 % . 
  it 's not , [ here ] ( https://ugeo.urbistat.com/adminstat/en/it/classifiche/tasso-disoccupazione/province/veneto/5/2 ) you can look at the unemployment rate and some other stats by region/province/city . 
  the divide is quite big . 
  he wo n't go home in 21 years though , that 's the difference . 
  when you have the lowest reoffending rate in the world does it really matter if one terrorist gets to live in prison comfortably ? 
  the point is that the number of people does n't matter , if 5 million people can manage a prison system with x people , why would n't 60 million people be able to manage a prison system with around 12x people ? 
  or even more for that matter , you 're just claiming it is n't possible while giving 0 proof . 
   `` hey , azraelcrusader , look !, 
  in norway if you kill 70 + ppl or robs a bank , you go in prison !!!, 
   . . and , guess what , you can even ask for online gaming !!!!, 
  in norway , you commit the biggest terrorist attack after ww2 and you stay in a comfortable prison for life . 
  in italy , you get to go home after 26 years : http://qn.quotidiano.net/2009/08/03/213669-valerio_fioravanti_uomo_libero.shtml fantastic system . 
   p.s : so , we should get rid of the 41bis ? 
   norway is also a 5,267,146 nation ... 5m ... milano + roma , metro area , is like 7.5 m. . .  it 's easy when you 're few . 
  r/shititalianssay it 's easy to do what ? 
  why can 5 million people manage a prison system in that way while 60 millions ca n't ? 
  no , i brought up that the person making fun of another culture where they mutilate females belongs to a culture where it 's acceptable to mutilate men , i did n't compare the acts themselves . 
  fgm being worse than male circumcision has nothing to do with the question `` is circumcision acceptable ? 
  '' , it 's irrelevant . 
  as i 've said multiple times , what you described is one type of fgm , the worst possibile type . 
  would you be ok with people performing fmg on little girls if all they did was partial removal of the labia , critoral hood removal ? 
  how is that relevant ? 
  does that justify male circumcision ? 
  i 'm not comparing fgm and male circumcision .
