  also , what you described is the worst possible type of fgm , there are others . 
   mgm is not crippling a male although it 's obviously unnecessary . 
  tell that to the guys who get botched circumcisions . 
   fgm cripples girls for the rest of their life , it 's vile , cruel thing to do . 
  there are many types of fgm , partial removal of the labia and critioral hood removal are both considered mutilation and they are n't `` crippling '' , i 'm not sure why we should see male circumcision differently . 
  actually you 're right , i meant that i did n't compare the acts themselves ( male vs female genital mutilation ) , which is what the other person implied . 
  i did n't compare anything , they 're both wrong . 
  your culture is n't much better when you look at male genital mutilation . 
  edit : fgm being worse than male circumcision is true but irrelevant . 
  actually she is the only person who won a nobel prize in two different scientific fields . 
  lol  how did you figure that the article left that out ? 
  wtf ? 
  when he wrote that comment it was n't included in the article : https://web.archive.org/web/20170703002111/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/02/gunmen-open-fire-outside-avignon-mosque-france-eight-injured/ it was included in the french source , you can check for yourself . 
  `` i hope people suffer for years so that i can further my political agenda '' . 
  same here , i think it 's rather obvious that he is n't a socialist , actual socialists hate him for his liberal views . 
  your assumption is that a man ca n't represent women and vice versa , which is just bizarre . 
  also , why stop at gender ? 
  what about level of education , income , city of residence and so on ? 
  there are plenty of ways in which parliaments do n't `` represent '' their country . 
  representation is about ideas , not things like gender , skin colour etc. . and it 's not like these women were elected because of some kind of gender parity law , they were elected because the electorate thought they were the best people to represent their interest . 
  which is fantastic , little girls can look at those women as say `` they were chosen because they were the best candidate '' and not `` they were chosen because of some law '' . 
  i do n't think that those 17 years of occupation are the reason why french is spoken in switzerland . 
  that 's why the question is `` how many republics has the * italian peninsula * housed ? '', 
  do sister republics count ? 
  about 19 of them were created between 1797 and 1799 . 
  also , there were 8 marine republics ( venezia , pisa , genova etc ) so it has to be more than that . 
  why sadly ? 
  in my opinion we should do more to protect our regional languages but that does n't mean that we ca n't do that and also use english in academia . 
  both things are beneficial . 
  a lot of italian universities have begun to offer courses in english and the number of people who can speak it is rising . 
  you and gennaro need to calm the fuck down by the way, 
  it 's not just gentiloni but italian politicians in general . 
  nice try but that 's the mortality rate , not the number of people who got measles . 
  https://media.historyofvaccines.org/images/999991_540.jpg edit : in the deleted comment he showed a graph about the mortality rate and it fell well before the introduction of the vaccine in 1963 , as one would expect given the improvements of medicine over the years . 
  in the other graph you can see how the number of people who got measles fell with the introduction of the vaccine . 
  cosa nostra , the sicilian mafia , makes billions of dollars each year . 
  in the [ 2nd mafia war ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_mafia_war ) alone more than a thousand people were killed and after the `` maxi-trial '' where hundreds of mafiosi were captured the `` war '' against the state begun , which led to terrorism and many homicides such as the homicides of [ falcone ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/giovanni_falcone ) and [ borsellino ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/paolo_borsellino ) . 
  falcone was killed exactly 25 years ago , on may 23rd 1992 . 
  also , it 's not like the mafia is only in sicily , it 's all over italy . 
  ` ndrangheta , camorra , sacra corona unita all make billions . 
  ` ndrangheta is incredibly powerful and has numerous connection with southern american drug cartels . 
  for example , roberto pannunzi was one of the biggest importers of cocaine in the world and his son married into a family from the medell\u00edn cartel . 
  another user already answered your question about mussolini , i just wanted to deal with how much of a problem the mafia has been . 
  `` mussolini never killed anyone , he just sent people on vacation on exile '' https://youtu.be/pfssjf2hphw, 
  you could have joined the armed forces anyway though , the real problem here is that you want to force the entire population to do something just because * you * want to do it . 
  yes , a car was damaged and that 's it . 
  yeah there are quite a lot of [ them ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_italy ) and the regional languages themselves have different dialects , like western and eastern lombard . 
  italians call those languages `` dialects '' so that 's why it might be confusing . 
  when talking to each other ( between different regions ) we just speak italian though , and those languages are being used less and less . 
  do you not understand them because they speak in a different dialect or because they speak in a different language ? 
  the ones in italy are regional languages , not dialects . 
  mine is too so i 'll give you a rough translation from italian : ** you will laugh a lot , sextille , of the people who claim that you take it in the ass ** ** and you will show them the middle finger . 
  ** ** but you are not , sextille , a lover of ass or pussy ** ** and you do n't even like the hot mouth of vetustinae ** ** you are none of this , sextille , i admit it : so what are you ? 
  ** ** i do n't know , but you know that there are only two possibilities . 
  ** at first the author ( martial ) defends sextille from people who claim he is a * cinadeum * ( those who take it in the ass ) and then says that sextille does n't like ass and pussy , nor the mouth of vetustinae and finally with the last verse , he accuses him of either practicing cunnilingus or of being a cocksucker , both equally bad and much worse than having anal sex for the romans . 
  no idea why i even posted this to be honest lol , i just like martial, 
  it 's just a really long way of insulting him, 
  [ wrong . 
  ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/3oz8xld9djq2l2vftu/giphy.gif ) there are many types of fgm , the removal of the clitoris is just one of them , what about clitoral * hood * ( not the clitoris ) reduction or partial removal of the labia ? 
  should we allow them because they are better than the worst type of fgm ? 
   i ca n't imagine her reaction if her boyfriend would suggest her pussy would be `` prettier '' and `` cleaner '' without a clitoris , she would use violence . 
  just a correction , i did n't say `` clitoris '' but `` clitoral * hood * '' , it 's quite different :p and it compares better to male circumcision . 
  no , you just do n't know what the clitoral hood is . 
  the first part of your comment is n't wrong , circumcision is worse than both of those practices . 
  i 100 % agree , we should also perform labiaplasty and clitoral hood reduction on every female newborn . 
  it 's amazing . 
  edit : clitoral hood = / = clitoris , not that complicated . 
  it 's just hipocrisy , i wonder what she would say if you told her that you would n't sleep with a woman who had n't undergone clitoral hood reduction or labiaplasty ( popular plastic surgeries that are still classified as fgm ) . 
  we should n't allow it for minors unless it 's for medical reasons , period . 
  clitoral hood removal is classified as female genital mutilation ( type 1a to be specific ) , i do n't see why we should n't see male circumcision as mutilation too . 
  we are n't talking about medical circumcision here . 
  edit : i do n't want to make anyone feel bad or anything , i 'm just saying that if as a society we consider every type of female `` circumcision '' genital mutilation , even the ones that are quite popular in terms of plastic surgery , there is no reason to consider male circumcision any differently . 
   i do n't want to sound like a r/conspiracy nut , but i feel that macron really is the friend of bankers and great capitalists . 
  it 's not like he 's lying about it , he was an investment banker . 
  he 's pro business , what 's wrong about it ? 
   well yeah , i think it 's one of things that has just been `` known '' by everybody as peculiarity in italian culture . 
  the thing is that in my opinion it 's too simplistic to `` blame '' the culture , especially when people outside of italy say that it 's the culture while italians tend to say that it 's socio-economic . 
  this [ pdf ] ( https://www.google.it/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://www.istat.it/it/files/2014/09/generazioni-a-confronto.pdf&amp;ved=0ahukewjmtoljwtptahubwbqkhsmqb4uqfgg6mak&amp;usg=afqjcngajyvgwaxvykgki-bz4dzw_pnimg ) ( in italian , page 99 ) says that , for people born between 1950 and 1954 , the median ( not average ) of people leaving their parents ' home was 25 for men and 22 for women , while for people born between 1985 and 1989 it was 28 for men and 25 for women . 
  even 25 and 22 was kind of high compared to other european countries , but even that might have not been cultural . 
  do you have a source on that ? 
  it seems to have changed a lot to be honest , but i only have anecdotes . 
  those universities are already there ( politecnico di bari , federico ii di napoli , universit\u00e0 di palermo ) . 
  he managed to escape because the germans arrived , but by the 25th of april they were almost defeated and they could n't have saved him again . 
  i could n't care less about who he was or what he did , no death penalty means no death penalty . 
  that does n't matter at all , the punishment for escaping from prison should n't be the death penalty . 
  no , it would have been better to imprison him . 
  one italian politician claimed that he is actually gay lol, 
  people who drive cars as a sport like in formula 1 don ' take the car home though . 
  driving a car to work is n't a sport . 
  well you do n't need to have the gun at home to practice the sport, 
  if it has nothing to do with defense , could n't you practice the sport without * owning * the weapon ? 
  do n't get me wrong i think it makes no sense for the eu to strengthen gun control in switzerland , a country without a gun problem and with less violence than other eu countries , i 'm just trying to understand where you 're coming from . 
  also , by `` liberal '' i meant more relaxed , not sure if that was ambiguous . 
  do you want guns because shooting is your hobby or because of personal defense ? 
  or both ? 
  what kind of gun law do you support ? 
  are you ok with the current swiss gun laws or would you rather have more liberal gun laws ? 
  i do n't understand your first point about having other remambrances of fascist italy anx the title might make * you * feel that way , when i hear liberation day i think of mussolini in piazzale loreto . 
  second ) again , that 's how you feel about it , it is n't liberation from nazism , but from nazifascism , i 've already explained what happened after 1943 . 
   saying `` mussolini 's contributions to fascism is n't represented because it has nothing to do with this '' simply is n't true , especially when you yourself acknowledge that `` germany increased its presence in northern italy effectively creating a puppet government with the aid of mussolini and the fascists '' .
