  definition : * as a noun : physical injury , especially that which is deliberately inflicted . 
  * as a verb : to physically injure . 
  how can you say that physical harm is wrong and then say that spanking kids is okay ? 
  it 's literally a contradiction . 
  thankfully people demonise it , such violence has no place in our societies . 
  what 's so ridicolous about the illegality of harming other people ? 
  as long as you finish a 5 year high school , no matter which type , you can go to university if you are able to pass the admission test , which is usually pretty easy . 
  high schools also offer evening courses for students with jobs . 
  if you abandoned school or performed poorly there is n't really anything `` institutional '' to stop you from going back to school , the biggest problems would be time and money . 
  that 's correct , article 75 prevents it so you 'd have to change that first . 
  a referendum is n't the only way to get out though . 
  the problem is that it 's just one of the possible gestures and it means a specific thing , in the memes they use it for everything . 
  no , i do n't trust the parliament and the senate either , i will never trust them . 
  what is that money for if there 's no tuition fee ? 
  what 's the difference between the grant and the loan , are they given to everyone who goes to university ? 
  the redditor / u/fishfingerpies was talking about believed the same :  i dare you to go to woolwich , birmingham , bradford and dewsbury holding a bottle of wine and see how quickly your ignorant and protected bubble will burst . 
  you do n't have to drink the wine , just hold it when you go to those place . 
  i dare you . 
  america is n't fucked , at all . 
  individual americans who are poor might be though , hopefully not . 
  nasa budget for 2017 is more than 3 times that of esa : http://spacenews.com/senate-bill-gives-nasa-19-3-billion-for-2017/ http://www.esa.int/about_us/welcome_to_esa/funding it 's also made up of many countries , so i do n't think it 's a fair comparison . 
  yes , but i 'm very bias given that it 's a field i love and i 'd like to work in when i 'm done with my studies . 
  anyway , other than the obvious scientific and technological advancements , it 's a good return on [ investment  ( http://www.esa.int/our_activities/space_engineering_technology/a_solid_investment )  every $ 1 invested in space returns an average $ 6 to the wider economy . 
  maybe we should cut back on our 23.4 billion [ military budget ] ( http://sociale.corriere.it/234-miliardi-di-euro-la-spesa-militare-nel-2017-in-italia-piu-21-in-dieci-anni/ ) ( just for italy ) , and put some more money in the 5.75 billion budget [ for esa ] ( http://www.esa.int/about_us/welcome_to_esa/funding ) . 
  between mandela , sanders and thomas paine , `` libertarian left '' . 
  this political compass is fucking bullshit . 
  what do abstract art , astrology , etc. . have to do with political philosophy ? 
  and how come sanders , who 's basically a standard social democrat , is so close to chomsky who is an anarchist ? 
  and jill stein is to the right of sanders as well . 
  about cup , how can anarchists be in the same party as stalinists , trotskists etc ? 
  underrated?i had a very different experience since he was the author we spent the most time on . 
  i liked montale , he did n't buy into that `` poeta vate '' bullshit and his view on suffering was interesting , a shame he was the author we spent the least time on . 
  we have a very different taste i guess . 
  it is random in the sense that they had no idea about that person being the berlin terrorist , of course if he was behaving suspiciously it was n't random . 
  those were two simple policemen doing their everyday job , it was n't the special forces or something , there is no reason with the information we have to believe they had knowledge of his location , given that they figured out who he was later . 
  i do n't know the answer but let me say something : this guy could have easily committed another attack on italian soil yesterday . 
  did anybody have a clue he was here ? 
  he was stopped for a random id check , if he wanted to who knows what he could have done since he was also armed . 
  i do n't think that they consider changing president every year a bad thing , quite the opposite . 
  the one guy i met and several others online said it , even though they never lived in italy nor they knew the language . 
  if people ask to you about your ancestry of course it is n't a problem for europeans for you to say that you 're 35 % polish . 
  but if you are talking about _ who _ you are , your identity , and you say that you are half polish without even having lived there or without knowing the language that is going to seem weird to a lot of us . 
  blood is basically the least important thing that connects you to a population . 
  so basically all the future children of the people that migrate from the rest of the eu will have the citizenship or the possibility to acquire it without even having a limit in the amount of times it can be passed down ? 
  jeez , once is already one too many , that 's just silly in my opinion . 
  that 's weird to say the least , at least with the italian citizenship ( as far as i know ) if your father did n't get it you ca n't either , if people got it automatically half of the us would be `` italian '' lol, 
  i 've heard that from a ton of people , it 's even worse since if your father/mother has the italian citizenship you can get it yourself , so there are people that have never stepped foot in italy and have it and it somehow makes them fully italian now . 
  i agree with you , . researching your ancestry is interesting but you ca n't force it `` into '' your identity . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.google.it/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3fv%3d0uc63zdcdro&amp;ved=0ahukewihvbu58pnqahvoghqkhtamc-8q3ywigzaa&amp;usg=afqjcnepj28tqup4ohfhx_y0u8bpjs_2tw&amp;sig2=zxvll2qrj4rvwvbyj8vivw ) you go . 
  i dislike it , unless you actually want to talk about something , for example one time an old man on the train asked me about the book i was reading and i gladly talked to him about it . 
  if it 's small talk , no thanks . 
  we use profe as well in high school lol, 
  that 's my point though , i think that `` italian '' is wrong , but not because everybody was roman , the opposite . 
  do we view the british empire from some place other than britain ? 
  what are you on about ? 
  it started in rome and then they conquered other territories . 
  and yes rome was a city as well , do you think there were no cities at the time ? 
  of course you were part of the empire but you were also part of your city . 
  people at the time `` feeling '' as citizens of the empire is entirely irrelevant , the point is that it started in italy and they then conquered other territories . 
  and please stop saying that we should read an history book , it makes you look like an asshole . 
  could you elaborate on what you think about the work culture ? 
  to me catholicism is pretty close to being a cult , it is n't a cult just because there are way too many members so it 's not easy to control . 
  at the end of the day the difference between a cult like jahova 's witnesses and catholicism is the amount of absurdities they believe in and the fact that while cults are mostly irrelevant , the catholic church has some power . 
  do you actually say `` pietra '' ? 
  i 've always heard `` carta forbici sasso '' . 
  note how i emphasised the word `` freedom '' , you have to understand that most people want it but there are various different definitions of it , you ca n't just claim that everyone that does n't accept your definition is anti-freedom . 
  it 's pretty clear that you do n't understand this since you keep using `` freedom '' as a buzzword , pushing the `` i love freedom and you do n't '' narrative so that if feels like you * have * * to * be right . 
  do n't downvote him just because you disagree with him . 
  * dio * * can *, 
  there are 3 other regions like that : valle d'aosta , friuli venezia giulia and sardegna . 
  also s\u00fcdtirol is n't a region by itself , the region is trentino + s\u00fcdtirol ( trentino - alto adige ), 
  he is n't going to have a problem with most university students . 
  when i went to the uk it felt like another world to be honest , to get on the bus there was an actual * queue * , i mean like a proper queue where there was one person behind the other in a line . 
  here i see that only at the post office , usually when people try to get on buses they try to be as close to the door as possible and they try to get into the bus at the same time . 
  it 's a bit different with people that commute by train , they seem to be more civil . 
  it does n't really have a meaning and it 's used to emphasise a variety of different things . 
  i can try to explain it with examples for example when something bad happens : '' i got into an accident '' `` eh * pota * ... '' and that means something like : `` shit happens '' . 
  or if someone says something obvious : `` were you at school this morning ? '', 
  it 's monday '' . 
  when you 're taken by surprise : '' * pota ma ?!, 
  * '' when you disagree with someone : `` pota , per me ti sbagli . '', 
  --  `` in my opinion you 're wrong '' . 
  when you agree with someone : `` pota ma hai ragione ! '', 
  --  `` but you 're right ! '', 
  and many other things , you can also add other words to give it a different meaning like : * cazzo * , * figa * , * enculat * ( all swear words by the way ) . 
  for example if you 're late and you could n't do anything about it : `` sei in ritardo !, 
  which translates to '' you 're late '' , `` of course i 'm late , there was traffic '' . 
  and * pota cazzo * means something like : what did you expect me to do about it ? 
  if somebody let 's you down , he does n't listen to you or stuff like that you can say : `` pota ma alura enculet ! '', 
  which basically means : '' well then you can go fuck yourself '' . 
  `` enculet '' is `` vaffanculo '' in italian which is `` fuck you '' in english . 
  it seems like we use * pota * for everything , but we do n't . 
  in my city we have a word that does n't even exist in italian : `` pota '' . 
  we use it a lot but i ca n't really explain what it means ... 
  yeah but why does that matter ? 
  being a sect is not necessarily something bad ... 
  to be honest we have our fair share of nonsense over here as well . 
  in italy there are 250000 jahova 's witnesses and they believe all the creationist stuff too . 
  do you `` use '' them for self defense as well or are they only for recreational use ? 
  in the season finale of the walking dead they filmed the same scene twice ( one for tv and one for the blue ray i guess ) because there were too many swear words , but in that same scene they showed two people getting their head smashed with a bat ... that 's kind of weird .
