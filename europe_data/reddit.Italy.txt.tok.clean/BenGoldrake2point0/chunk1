as for your opinion it is irrelevant . 
  i do n't see why . 
  my opinion is that a good path to solving prison overcrowding is reducing the prison population by decriminalizing certain offences and using alternative correctional measures for others . 
  since we are talking about prison overcrowding , that opinion is not irrelevant at all . 
  i for one think we should treat all people decently , just because they are people . 
  there 's a middle ground between giving prisoners hilton plaza rooms and cramming them in overcrowded cells , we should strive to reach that middle ground . 
  i also think ( and that 's not exactly a novel opinion ) that a lot of drug-related crime should either be not a crime , or not dealt with by handing out prison sentences . 
  yes , we do have a * slight * overcrowding problem . 
  that 's what budget cuts to prison personell will do in a country with organized crime and far too many offences that warrant jail time ( including drug offences ) . 
  yes , because czech in italian is `` ceco '' , which sounds exactly the same as `` cieco '' ( blind ) so when you tell the joke in person there 's a misunderstanding . 
  i do n't remember how the joke goes though . 
   not employing computers/networks/software in general this . 
  you can use aggregate data to take a look at what companies do with their profits - sit on them , expand , innovate , renovate and so on . 
  if you do it for italian companies in the 90s , you see a general trend of companies mostly sitting pretty on the profits they made from increased productivity in the early 90s , very little investment into new processes and technology . 
  fun fact : part of the cineca supercomputing lab that 's listed there for italy is in my department ; its cooling system pushes out so much hot air that our garden , which is built on top of the underground lab , is rather warm even in winter . 
  if you stand in the right spot you can feel the hot air currents rising from the vents below . 
  i second this and i also suggest making a thread that will collect links to those threads , that could be added to the sidebar for future users to read ( and current users to see whether they 've missed something ) . 
  in my experience , italians mainly think of the czech republic as : - good beer - beautiful women - confusion with slovakia - beer - for some prague is in austria ( i am not kidding ) - beer, 
  you captured his motivations perfectly . 
  in the run up to the european elections , and with media controls in place preventing him from being on the air 24/7 on his 3 tv channels , he has always resorted to making overblown and controversial statements to get air time . 
  the clown does n't believe a word he says , tomorrow we might see him praising germany for its great work in recognising the holocaust if that 's what gets his face in the news . 
  i 'm fairly left-wing and flirted with the idea of voting for tsipras , but his coalition shows the same infighting and inability to unite that has plagued the left forever . 
  i do n't want to elect a bunch of meps that will start bickering amongst themselves and splitting up along internal ideological lines the minute they set foot in the eu parliament . 
  so schulz it is . 
  i read over the pes manifesto for the european elections and find myself largely in agreement with it . 
  also , the personal satisfaction of seeing the man [ berlusconi so brazenly and embarassingly insulted ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmxpvcmihg0 ) ( turn on cc for english subtitles ) elected president of the ec can not be understated . 
  as usual when this question comes up , a lot of oversimplifications , stereotypes and romanticized views are being thrown around . 
  the truth is that the present crisis had a different background and was precipitated by different contingent factors in every country . 
  i do not pretend to know spain , portugal , ireland or greece well enough to explain how it happened there , so i will talk about my own country , italy . 
  let 's go back in time a little bit , unfortunately this wo n't be brief . 
  if you want to skip to the immediate causes of the crisis , scroll down to the first bold line . 
  up until the mid-70s , italy was a fairly regular european country both in terms of its economy and in terms of the efficiency and honesty of its state apparatus . 
  between the mid-70s and the early 90s , a succession of italian governments started using public debt and currency devaluations to prop up the economy , guarantee prosperity and buy themselves public favor , leading to an explosion of public debt ( debt/gdp doubled in 15 years ) and making the economy over-reliant on currency devaluation to stay competitive . 
  in the early 90s that system came crashing down . 
  not only was that political class swept away by a series of scandals , but our new european obligations meant that we could no longer borrow or print money to keep going . 
  governments started to try to rein in spending while our economy was brutally exposed to world competition without the benefit of a weak currency . 
  needless to say , we did not adapt well . 
  the reckless and very inefficient public spending of the previous 15 years had become entrenched and power figures of all kinds fought tooth and nail to protect their turf , meaning that cuts were ineffective in reducing excess spending and disproportionately affected those areas that did not hold significant political power ( healthcare and education for example ) . 
  our economy did n't fare much better . 
  our industries reacted to the new demands of global competitions well enough at first ( early 90s ) by reorganizing and streamlining their processes , but they largely failed to make key investments in new technology ( especially it ) , which meant that once reorganization was done our productivity stagnated while it kept growing in the rest of the world . 
  the reduction in public stimulus , stagnation of productivity and end of competitive devaluation meant that , in real terms , our economy has stagnated since the early 90s , but at least our debt/gdp ratio was slowly coming down . 
  in the early 2000s , budget decisions by the berlusconi government effectively ended the debt-reduction trend ; the increase in public spending was unfortunately mostly swallowed up by the economic downturn following 9/11 , so any potential gdp-boosting effect was lost . 
  ** when berlusconi returned to power in 2008 ** , at the beginning of the world economic crisis , his government failed to recognize any potential risk for italy , claiming that we were not going to be involved . 
  by then , italy was a country with a stagnant economy ( practically zero inflation-adjusted growth for the previous 20 years ) , excessively high public debt , very inefficient public administration and dangerously unrestrained public expenditure . 
  due to the relative conservativism of our financial system we were not immediately hit by the crisis , and for two and a half years we weathered it relatively unscathed . 
  in early 2011 , however , the continually worsening economic outlook and reckless economic policy ( berlusconi was still resolutely refusing to do anything about the crisis or our budget ) prompted investors to reconsider their confidence in our public debt . 
  berlusconi 's dismissive and irresponsible reaction to allegations that our finances might not be as solid as in the past only precipitated the matter , causing a spike in our interest rates that threatened our ability to finance ourselves on the financial markets . 
  amidst public terror for a potential sovereign debt default , with news programs giving daily and sometimes hourly updates on our interest rates , berlusconi was forced to step down by an internal rebellion in his own party and pressure from virtually the entirety of the italian and european political and financial establishments . 
  mario monti was called in to form a new government , while the ecb effectively guaranteed that it would not let the country slide into default ( because we are way too big to fail ) . 
  the rest , as they say , is recent history . 
   example , italy had one of the most dynamic currencies in the world , and that was imposed by it 's economy ( especially tourism and the agriculture sector ) . 
  i understand where the stereotype comes from , but italy 's economy is ** not ** mainly reliant reliant on tourism ( 10 % gdp ) or agriculture ( 1.8 % ) . 
  like all modern economies , it 's a service-based economy ( 73 % ) with a smaller industrial sector ( 25 % ) and a miniscule agricultural sector ( 1.8 % ) . 
  no matter who invented it and where it was first made , it is completely foreign to italian culinary tradition and i mean * completely * foreign . 
  to hopefully make it extremely clear : what i 'm arguing is that because of schengen the immigration debate is , on a practical level , a europe-wide debate , which means that immigration issues stemming from the colonial history of certain countries affect all european nations . 
  whether you * care * about this or not is your choice , and i certainly never said you should care . 
  if you * do n't * care about this i do n't really see what made you engage in this discussion . 
   the foreigners are n't entitled to immigrate . 
  never said they are . 
   do you want to start arguing that i should let black people come and go into my house as they please because of the atlantic slave trade ? 
  never even came close to suggesting this . 
  stick to what i actually said : do you seriously think that * decades * is too long a length of time to claim anything for actions that happened that far in the past ? 
   that is exactly your issue . 
  you believe there should be/are `` practical post-colonial matters '' on the european stage and there simply are n't . 
  they 're all internal to your own states regardless of your hopeful wishing . 
  dude , no : the existence of a border union means that if , say , france gives preferential treatment to people from former french colonies who want to immigrate , those people could very well end up in finland despite finland feeling no sense of obligation to former french colonies . 
  this is a fact , and it 's also where the discussion ends unless you are willing to accept this basic premise . 
   what pray tell are you talking about ? 
  the fact that , by your own admission , you example was not of people wanting to immigrate into a former colonial power seeking a better life , but of people wanting to reclaim land that they feel belongs to their nation . 
   i recognize it , i simply do n't frame it in the ridiculous way you do by pretending a border agreement somehow relates to your internal identity matters . 
  i have never brought up any question of internal identity or any such thing . 
   it is very much the same as far as the rest of europe is concerned . 
  again , no : there are linguistic , cultural and legal differences between the two cases . 
  you are entitled to believe there should n't be any , but there * are * . 
  this is a fact : a brazilian and a vietnamese immigrant to portugal * are not in the same situation * . 
  to reiterate : what you believe * should * be the case and what currently * is * the case are two different things , and i am * not * saying that you should believe anything else , only that the current situation is what it is . 
  edit : forgot to reply to the last line  if you want any special treatment for them you can pay for it out of your own pocket and in your own land . 
  of course , you are entitled to this opinion . 
  it does n't change the fact that several countries belonging to the schengen area * will * give special treatment to immigrants from former colonies and * the system currently being what it is * , even if you do n't like it , makes that a matter that everybody has to deal with . 
  again , i am not saying you should just accept the system and be ok with it , only that you should n't deny that the problem * currently * does not just sit in the lap of former colonial powers . 
   if we 're talking primarily in those terms i wonder why we 're pretending colonization was a complete devastation for all involved ? 
  your memory is doing you a disservice , go re-read how i described colonialism at the top of this comment chain . 
   into turkish territory certainly . 
  setting up parallel greek communities in former greek heartland would no doubt swell the breast of many a nationalist . 
  so you agree that your example does not actually deal with immigration into a former colonial power . 
  why did you bring it up ? 
   the current arrangement is still not a european matter . 
  [ ... ] we legally have the right to deport asylum seekers to their entry point destinations like italy for instance . 
  the system by which you can expel asylum seekers back to their country of first entry is part of that same european arrangement that you refuse to recognize ( [ dublin convention ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin_convention ) . 
   practical `` post-colonial matters '' are the same as for any other immigrants no , they are not . 
  you can bury your head in the sand and refuse to acknowledge it if you wish , but you ca n't change the fact that a brazilian immigrating to portugal is not the same as a vietnamese doing the same for a host of linguistic , cultural and even legal reasons . 
   i get tired of hearing that the west owes immigrants for things that happened decades to centuries ago . 
  you think that * decades * is too long a time to claim anything for past torts ? 
  * decades * is a length of time that is in living memory of millions of people . 
  decolonization happened in the 1960s . 
  that 's too far removed in time to matter today ? 
   amusing that you should frame it like that . 
  it 's the correct way to frame the discussion , which is n't about  national character but rather about the relative economic and social conditions of former colonial powers and colonies , like you yourself say a few lines below . 
   i 'm pretty sure the greeks would be overjoyed to be able to immigrate to northern cyprus , constantinople etc en-mass\u00e9 are you seriously claiming that there is a mass sentiment in greece that they would like to emigrate to turkey , if only they could ? 
  be serious .
