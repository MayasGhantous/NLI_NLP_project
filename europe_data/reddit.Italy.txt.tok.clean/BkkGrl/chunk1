  i hope ukip is just a temporary phase, 
  not really , what do you mean ? 
  rock 'n rolla too, 
  no , i 'm still in italy , i 'm getting my master degree in the next month . 
  i want to live abroad for a couple of years after that , but i 'm looking more to northern europe . 
   is renzi really going to be able to make radical changes ? 
  perhaps . 
  he is encountering a titanic resistance in every level of politics and governance and his political position is still unclear , but i 'm hopeful, 
   i do concur with what you say : italy is facing a serious brain drain that seems to be ever ongoing . 
  this is the fuck-up of the older generation of gerontocrats that have basically demoralized young people so much that it will actually make them turn their back on their own country . 
  i wonder if berlusconi and all the other idiots that have been voted into office there over the past 20-30 years are proud on this . 
  this is absolutely correct , the sensation among youngsters is exactly this . 
  most of my friends who moved do n't want to go back if the situation does n't change radically, 
  please cut it with this crap, 
  we envy you a lot , but that means that there still is hope, 
  i actually like it a lot . 
  the waiting room hanging over the tracks is a good idea, 
  very beautiful, 
  this is nothing about multilingualism , it 's all about making the thread readable and tidy , not a mess of 230 languages mixed together, 
  massive control of the televisions and of the entire politic life ( `` everyone that 's not me is communist and want to ruin you '' ) also italians were disillusioned by the politics in general after mani pulite and looked for the strongman but yeah , there really is n't an excuse for people voting for him for such a long time , we were just plain stupid,

  putin was right, 
  the rotermann looks amazing , i should visit tallinn, 
  why eu was so unpopular in 2011 ? 
  ca n't find a single negative outlook, 
  damn , we sure are delusional, 
  modernism died [ in 1972 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pruitt%e2%80%93igoe ) in fact , it 's more than outdated, 
  the reddit hivemind strikes again, 
  he has gone full ceau\u0219escu, 
  we did it reddit, 
   mceuropean union blasphemy !, 
  i just want to say that i love your flag and alphabet,

  i generally prefer blue/green eyes , but spanish girls are fun fun fun,

  no love for san marino :( ^ ^ ^ / jk, 
  every french girl i met was very beautiful . 
  we do n't hate any country in europe , we even like a lot russians , they often come in my city as tourist and we can discuss nicely . 
  i travelled most of the balkans and everyone was very welcoming, 
  how so ? 
  probably because it 's too difficult to pick them one by one,

  war is hell, 
  fixing ` ndrangheta requires an incredible effort . 
  maybe someday, 
  sorry , i did n't mean to be a dick . 
  i hope things will get better, 
  calm down , it was just a joke . 
  of course the law is nuts , and i hope things will change in the next elections, 
   i am perfectly fine with a new cold war , because this time we 're in the prosperous side where no one is being mass murdered for being latvian .

  apparently swiss have even less figuring of sarcasm than germans, 
  romania laughs at you, 
  they could litterally live out of the interest of that fund, 
  aww , thank you !, 
  this is funny when it 's a joke , but does n't have any link to reality . 
  italy has an army like any other european country, 
  good work mvrdv !,

  lega nord , ` nuff said, 
  european planes stronk,

  the opinions in southern europe are shifting to distrust toward eu because it only promotes austerity . 
  i hope a better message will pass soon, 
  visited norway , came back poor, 
   what about just average rich french people or other rich europeans ? 
  you mean belgians ? 
  correct . 
  but it 's mostly for italians who ca n't go to germany for the real one, 
  need more , we should invent some kind of `` german welcome '' festivity, 
  damn invasors , bring euromonies at least, 
  germans in italy , what ? 
  automatic live chat ? 
  really ? 
  southern italy mostly, 
  it was an exceptional event ( well , not so exceptional anymore with climate change ... ) , but they generally die when they touch the land . 
  it 's much more dangerous for the boats, 
  genovese spotted, 
  waterspouts are no joke . 
  this was taken in genova , the city where i live http://i.imgur.com/ukhobce.jpg and this one in camogli http://i.imgur.com/xncu5ov.jpg,
