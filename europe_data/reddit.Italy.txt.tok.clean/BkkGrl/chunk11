  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk6txmsvgqg i prefer to imagine him chased by an angry mob around the parliament, 
  i 've travelled all turkey . 
  you have cities that are pretty much european ( istambul , izmir ) and then the ~ ~ campaigns ~ ~ countryside , that are hugely backwards , where erdogan is king, 
  * soon *, 
  ah , another costituency acting like the mafia also  france has also lost its status as the world 's biggest wine producer . 
  last year italy produced 4,900 million litres compared with 4,700 million litres in france . 
  sweet , sweet dominion, 
  i resign !, 
  * why * we are going to be killed but ai in a couple of decades anyway, 
  or both ? 
  brb buying a ticket, 
   world * alcoholic grape beverage * domination but then yeah , world domination, 
  we have agents everywhere, 
  safety requires sacrifices, 
  put a secret agent in every pizza place . 
  terrorism wiped, 
  * he knows *, 
  celtic triskelions really , they both had nordic invasors, 
  i was there five years ago . 
  fuck this , i 'm so sad, 
  switzerland 2.0, 
  damn barbarians stealing our women, 
  being so low makes me sad, 
  you have never met one so , complaining is a national sport recently, 
  you start having a sorbetto without alcohol and then it 's a slipperly slope to the fall of society , i tell you !, 
  i mean , we are a goddamn founding member of eu, 
  this is some kind of next level butthurt, 
  i agree with western slovakia, 
  baby steps, 
  i still see herbalife billboards sometimes, 
  time to build some windmill, 
  no hookers ? 
  if you exclude the supercar southern italy is really cheap, 
  can confirm we did this and we managed to have a cheap tour of norway !, 
  at least all of your colonies are not failed states, 
  you mean greenland , right ? 
  i had no idea it was so compicated , thanks, 
  could we have the double flair like in / r/vexillology ? 
  that was unexpected, 
  the eu is having a lot of troubles . 
  this said i do n't believe the end is night and we had much worse problems in recent history , if we manage to hold tight we could actually come out stronger, 
  italian of course !, 
  ^ ^ ^ no ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ not, 
  sounds like southern italy , incredibly beautiful or moustaches, 
  yes !, 
  wait ... 
  what if your country do n't have very big companies ? 
  it feels like they helped the banks first and then the corporations, 
  they are also increasing qe, 
  seven , qe was alredy full force last year, 
  this is far more complex than building a metro complex , also we already have metro in our biggest cities . 
  every big infrastructure is driven from te top in china and is used for political favors ( see the empty cities they built ) . 
  yes , our model is far superior, 
  an economist can eli5 please ? 
   is the ecb out of ammunition ? 
  independent banking analyst miguel carri\u00f3n \u00c1lvarez told dw that no , it is n't , but `` to hit its inflation target it needs to be bolder . '', 
  for example , `` it could increase the volume of its bond-purchasing program by making synthetic bonds backed by nonperforming loans eligible for its asset-backed securities program , '' he said . 
  this would be a way of helping italian banks in particular , which are weighed down with about 350 billion euros in bad debt . 
  by helping them clear nonperforming loans off their balance sheets , ecb could put italy 's banks in a better position to get back to lending to businesses and consumers , which have had a hard time accessing credit in recent years . 
  pls do,

  i like how there is a 3 % of itself in the fund, 
  http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/blogs/makingwaves/nutella-palm-oil-deforestation/blog/53269/  and as far as consumer companies go , ferrero , the maker of nutella , is actually one of the more progressive consumer-facing companies when it comes to palm oil sourcing . 
  responding to the demands of their customers , ferrero was one of the first companies to announce a policy to end the use of deforestation palm oil . 
  they literally flee to the anglos, 
  he must have a pretty big matress, 
  that is a secret like coca cola, 
  a more planned antititrust and a more equal taxation should be enough, 
  still is debatable how right is a society where he can be so rich while half of the population is struggling to live, 
  that is one smug face if i 've ever seen one, 
  that is the most icelandish name ever, 
  sadly michele ferrero died last year , now is maria franca fissolo , the widow, 
  also known as the cocaine rooster county ? 
  that 's a huge cantilever, 
  russians and japanese have the coolest vexillology,
