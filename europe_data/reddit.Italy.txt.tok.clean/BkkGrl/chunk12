  as we say , fried air, 
   2.2 fiscal policy in presence of protracted modest growth rate and exceptionally low inflation even the extraordinary measures put in place by the european central bank are proving insufficient . 
  fiscal space should be fully used to support growth . 
  at the same time , r estor i ng a sustainable p ace of growth and job creation is also the most effective way to keep debt on a sustainable path . 
  m ore symmetry is needed in macroeconomic adjustment . 
  very large current account surpluses have a negative impact on the overall functionin g of the eurozone just as current account deficits . 
  to the extent that they reflect excess savings surpluses should be addressed by policies spurring investment , both private and public . 
  a more cooperative approach to support demand would lead to a win - win equilibrium complementing structural reforms . 
  the macroeconomic imbalance procedure should be implemented more effectively to this end . 
  the new european fiscal board should take a pan - european view in its analyses and formulate fiscal policy recommendati ons for the euro area as a whole . 
  this is key to develop an aggregate policy stance and an eu - wide growth strategy which goes beyond the mere sum of national performance . 
  f iscal rules should prove their adequacy to cope with a challenging economic environment . 
  a framework designed for normal conditions of growth and inflation has proved incapable to tackle effectively the impact of very low nominal growth on potential growth and on debt d ynamics . 
  these shortcomings have implications for the measurem ent of fiscal indicators on which policy recommendations are based and should be addressed . 
  price developments should be more effectively embedded in fiscal rules .
