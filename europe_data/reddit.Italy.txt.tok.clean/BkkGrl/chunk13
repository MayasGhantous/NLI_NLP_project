  happy new year !,

  ireland is already doing so good that is not considered, 
  can confirm , this is very important for italian and german economies , not so much for english ones, 
  we love to believe we suck ^ ^ ^ because ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ true ^ ^ ^ sometimes, 
  apparently not, 
  you can see costa concordia being dismantled on the right, 
  except switzerland, 
  so a win-win situation, 
  there is really not much pressure there . 
  if the water is still the only pressure is given by the depth , really not that much here see http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/hydrostatic-pressure-water-d_1632.html, 
  make star wars , not actual wars ? 
  everyone would, 
  this is a good analysis , but i guess albania and kosovo will join at the same time . 
  also nice to see a kiwi here !, 
   the world of 2045 ~ ~ could ~ ~ will be different compare a 2010 situation in eu to today . 
  almost everything changed, 
  does n't matter , had union, 
  ugh , this is painful to watch,

  this is really well done, 
  i might understand that finland in december can be rough if you are used to a warmer climate , but austria is one of the most beautiful countries in eu , absolutely no reason to leave, 
  i would love so much that what 's going on in ireland could be replicated in italy, 
   look up alcohol at dictionary.com 1540s ( early 15c . 
  as alcofol ) , `` fine powder produced by sublimation , '' from medieval latin alcohol `` powdered ore of antimony , '' from arabic al-kuhul `` kohl , '' the fine metallic powder used to darken the eyelids , from kahala `` to stain , paint . '', 
  the al - is the arabic definite article , `` the . '', 
  `` powdered cosmetic '' was the earliest sense in english ; definition broadened 1670s to `` any sublimated substance , the pure spirit of anything , '' including liquids . 
  modern sense of `` intoxicating ingredient in strong liquor '' is first recorded 1753 , short for alcohol of wine , which was extended to `` the intoxicating element in fermented liquors . '', 
  in organic chemistry , the word was extended 1850 to the class of compounds of the same type as this . 
  this is actually correct,

   the plane 's arrival was first reported earlier this year in italian newspapers , who said that it was intended to replace the much smaller a319 currently flying prime minister matteo renzi around the world . 
  the corriere della sera newspaper reports that the old jet needs to land every five hours to refuel , necessitating stops in countries including russia and kazakhstan that will no longer be necessary . 
  it was probably needed , but i find ridicolous that they ca n't find an air force pilot that can fly an average plane, 
  did they solved the problem with the `` corrosive '' action of the neutrons on the vessel ? 
  do n't they use glonass ? 
  eli12 what fueled the growth ? 
   an eu source familiar with rome 's position told euobserver : `` [ they 're ] not blocking anything . 
  [ they ] say the issue deserves a political discussion . 
  there 's no objection in principle . 
  but the issue deserves at least five minutes of discussion , whether in the european council , or in another format . '' for its part , the luxembourg eu presidency has not decided whether to call the debate at an ambassadors meeting on thursday , an eu foreign ministers event on monday , or the eu summit next thursday . 
  as long as they do it quick i do n't see nothing wrong, 
  mostly because they are a coal powered nation, 
  like in self loathing, 
  maybe i just have a proble with neoclassic + gold, 
  the austrian one is seriously tacky,

   christensen had volunteered for oxfam while studying in britain , and was never a particularly enthusiastic recruit to his native island 's new industry . 
  he remembers complaining about how jersey was keeping money for corrupt african officials , and being told `` nobody gives a shit about africa anyway '' . 
  over the years , he became increasingly troubled by the amount of dirty money coming in , and the fact no one on the island appeared to care . 
   for christensen , the final indignity came in 1993 when a foreign exchange trader defrauded investors ( mostly americans ) out of $ 26m via a jersey subsidiary -- a scam that local authorities refused to investigate for years . 
   when the scandal attracted the attention of a reporter from the wall street journal a few years later , there was little doubt about the identity of jersey 's `` senior civil servant '' who said , of his colleagues : `` they are totally out of their depth '' . 
  it was effectively christensen 's resignation letter .
