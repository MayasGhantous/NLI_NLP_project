  fucking finally, 
  what exactly do you mean with a bubble ? 
  my dank-o-meter is off scale, 
  you are exaggerating . 
  our policy and governance is aligned to most of europe , if we underperform it 's mostly because of widespread inefficience and endemic problems , there is not a puppeter hand controlling everything, 
  sadly yes afaik,

  yep , what will remain after the reform will be a useless stump just to keep some chairs for favors . 
  still much better than before, 
  polls will probably appear before the final voting , but almost everyone agree that reform the senate was highly needed . 
  the reform in my opinion is botched because the remaining senate will be totally useless , much better removing it completely . 
  the european central bank signalled it would expand its $ 1.1 tn quantitative easing programme in december and cut its deposit rate should the slowdown in emerging markets threaten the eurozone 's economic recovery . 
  the euro fell 1.67 per cent against the dollar to $ 1.116 after mario draghi , the ecb 's president , said policymakers ' measures would need to be `` re-examined '' at its december 3 vote . 
  he said the central bank stood ready to adjust the `` size , composition and duration '' of its qe programme . 
  at the moment , it is buying $ 60bn of mostly government bonds a month and has said it will continue to do so at least until september 2016 . 
  investors in europe viewed mr draghi 's refusal to rule out an interest-rate cut and his allusion to further qe as a signal to buy , sending prices for european assets sharply higher on thursday . 
  government bond yields , which move inversely to prices , fell across the region , with italian and spanish benchmark 10-year borrowing rates dropping to the lowest level since april and the shorter-term two-year german borrowing rate hitting a record low of minus 0.32 per cent . 
  `` these are big intraday moves , '' said joakim tiberg , rates strategist at ubs . 
  `` it shows you that investors are repositioning themselves in anticipation for further bond buying by the ecb . 
  it 's a strong reaction . '' while the ecb 's asset-buying programme appears to have thawed the eurozone 's credit markets , growth remains lacklustre and inflation has fallen back into negative territory . 
  the ecb president said the outlook for inflation was now `` less sanguine '' and warned of the risks emanating from emerging markets , notably china . 
  some members of the ecb 's 25-strong council of policymakers had called for more aggressive monetary easing as soon as thursday , although mr draghi cautioned that this was `` not a prevailing theme '' of the meeting . 
  as well as expanding the qe programme , the ecb could also break an earlier promise to leave interest rates unchanged and cut its deposit rate further into negative territory , a move which is likely to further weaken the euro if implemented . 
  the central bank 's governing council on thursday held the deposit rate , which it charges on banks ' deposits parked at the ecb , at minus 0.2 per cent . 
  the benchmark main refinancing rate , charged on banks ' borrowings from the central bank , stayed at 0.05 per cent . 
  both rates are at record lows . 
  the ecb president said cuts into negative territory by other central banks , such as the swiss national bank and scandinavian authorities , had led the ecb to reassess where the lower boundary for interest rates lay . 
  `` we 've seen the experience of other central banks and now we 're thinking about that , '' mr draghi said . 
  dirk schumacher , economist at goldman sachs , said mr draghi 's remarks were a `` a clear hint for further action in december . '' by december , the ecb staff will have rolled out their latest quarterly projections for growth and inflation . 
  most economists expect those projections to show inflation will take longer than previously thought to return to the ecb 's target of below , but close to , 2 per cent . 
  that would force the central bank to act . 
  `` expect a package of measures in december with rate cuts and more bond purchases to significantly ease monetary conditions immediately rather than to loosen policy in baby steps , '' said richard barwell , economist at bnp paribas investment partners . 
  while inflation is set to remain low in the months ahead , mr draghi said policymakers still believed price pressures would pick up around the turn of the year . 
  there were , however , `` downside risks '' to that outlook . 
  markets had been flat ahead of thursday 's ecb meeting as analysts speculated that although further qe in europe was possible , it was unlikely to be announced this month . 
  the rally on thursday reflected an expectation that the next meeting will provide a detailed plan for an expanded programme , said alex barnes at citi . 
  `` nothing has actually changed , '' he said . 
  `` the reaction we 're seeing is due to the door being opened for qe expansion . 
  that means markets are expecting mr draghi to come up with something concrete at the next meeting . 
  if not there is the risk of disappointment . '',

       lukashenko is refusing [ 6 ] to allow building rufed 's military base in belarus . 
  his motivation : rufed 's military base in crimea was used to seize the region . 
  similar situation happened in south ossetia ( and abkhazia ) . 
  it 's difficult to fool people four times using the same trick ... 
  i have the impression that lukashenko is generally smarter than the average dictator,
