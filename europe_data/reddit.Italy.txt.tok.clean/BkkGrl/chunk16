  this would start a third mandate of gridlocked congress , people will start to get really pissed off, 
  i actually believe that trump is a useful idiot . 
  my wet dream is a trump/sanders election . 
  if sanders wins we see if there is a potentially change in america ( socialism is not a banned word anymore in politics for example ) and a reforms of the gop is necessary to be ever elected again if trump wins it will cause a collapse in the structure of american politics and probably the us will finally have a multiparty elections instead of an absolute duopoly both options would be a magnificent spectacle and i 'm here waiting with the popcorn, 
  what if climate change is a plot of the dutch tobe employed buy every other country to build dykes and become filty rich ?

  stealing of ancient art make so little sense , it 's almost impossible to sell also you are the very bottom of humanity if you take advantage of a disaster,

  memes are meant to be stolen, 
  last year i was in palermo , it 's a perfect tourist destination with tons of things to see and it 's criminally underrated imho,

  he 's not that bad ( tbh i believe he 's the least bad at the moment ) but he came with great promises and he is struggling to delivery .
