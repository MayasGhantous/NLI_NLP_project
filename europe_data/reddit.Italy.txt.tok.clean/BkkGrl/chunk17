  the quality of the modding has become abysmal !, 
  you are relatively doing fine , and things are getting better, 
  worse than / r/animalporn or / r/animalporngifs ? 
  i hope you get better, 
  that 's one of the stupidest things of reddit honestly . 
  i 'm just happy that r/vexillology is not r/flagporn, 
  shit , that 's serious . 
  how could that happen ? 
  i blame putin, 
  goddamn gene therapy !,

  til there is a roman teathre in valle d'aosta, 
  fuck me i wanted to answer the crimea comment , sorry,

  we can barely predict what happens next year , these maps are pointless, 
  small and large countries work in a economic point of view waaay different to be honest , this is a huge oversemplification, 
  idk i would like this https://paulwilkinson.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/mega-church-bus-from-sacred-sandwich.jpg, 
  it 's rapture time !, 
  stupid people blame eu for its problems in italy , the main gripe is about the whole austerity period that hurt a lot the economy , even if the main problem was the impossibility to devalue the currency and boost the exports and get out of the crisis much quicker, 
  and lovely urk, 
  this place is close to the location of the last earthquake . 
  central italy is very beautiful, 
  hey , i stopped for whole 4 days in prague !, 
  this is a problem only if the salaries have not grown accordigly . 
  have they ? 
  i expected more , czechia is a popular destination . 
  in italy is 7 %, 
  because people are lazy and they are doing nothing illegal, 
  you never stop to fight for human rights , do n't take anything for granted, 
   morning after pill ban what that is pure evil, 
  does it mean anything ? 
  there are many sources https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_largest_cities_throughout_history, 
  zerohedge is a terrible conspiracy website, 
  thanks for the slice of life . 
  how 's the movement to other countries ? 
  can a worker go to poland or russia and send the money home ? 
  shivers down my spine,

  that 's why . 
  do english speaking worker have problem to find a job there ? 
  hydrocarbon do wonder for the skin i guess ? 
  thieves !, 
   the city itself is a small version of amsterdam , with canals , bridges , cosy alleys and canal houses . 
  ... and none of the annoying tourists, 
  i 've been there a month ago , it 's one of the nicest cities in the netherlands, 
  impossible to sell anyway, 
  for the ones who criticize the building , remember that the architect was probably requested a shit-ton square meters in the same area of the building without touching it , its not that she decided to do whatever she wanted . 
  she was also very famous for her particular design , and still they chose her . 
  also , personal opinion - i love it !, 
  zaha in a nutshell, 
  really nice and fun, 
  dropbears, 
  [ surface adjusted it would be even bigger ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jfwvolz.jpg ) link http://thetruesize.com/#?borders=1~!mty5njq3nzm.mte0mty2nty*mjcxnzc3mzq ( mzq2ndg0na ~ ! mx * nzm3oty1mw.mjeynduxnda ) mw, 
  but we would crush eesti 's dream also, 
  we could move them south , but then the population would die of sunstroke, 
  rip nordic countries, 
  or more generally database everywhere else, 
  thorium solves a lot of problems but bring a lot of new ones that are not avoidable yet see https://it.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3tt6y6/til_one_tonne_of_thorium_is_equivalent_to_200/cx95oxj, 
  but you can see through a fence and mock who 's behind, 
  35 is bees, 
       girls have to polish doorknobs instead . 
   - sun does n't shine consistently enough + solar power is still the least efficient way of generating green energy . 
  i have lived in the netherlands , you get an english climate sadly  - wind turbines work , but we 'd need a metric fuckton of them , and they 're all out in the sea so i imagine they cost a lot to place/keep running . 
  also the potential ecological damage . 
  but i 'd like to find a study about this since it seems the most reasonable way . 
  sea turbines is definitely the best choice , the uk started investing a lot on them and seems to be a good idea, 
  not more than israel and iran, 
  i expect troubles, 
  2017 will be fun, 
  i am talking of the indipendent btw, 
  the guy idiotically tied the referendum to an approval of himself it 's gon na be brexit 2 : resignation bogaloo,

  are you having a stroke m8 ? 
  we do n't have the most photogenic pm ... 
  it 's bangkok btw, 
   cough bunga bunga cough   ps : that 's not a proposition . 
  is 2016 the year of the retarded politics ? 
  we like to complain of our politicians , but outside it 's often much worse, 
  while i think the same , it 's like sweeping the dirt under the carpet , it only postpones the problem, 
  putin be like `` why do i have to deal with this tool '', 
  plenty of russians in italy too, 
  even the sentence buying a country makes no sense,
