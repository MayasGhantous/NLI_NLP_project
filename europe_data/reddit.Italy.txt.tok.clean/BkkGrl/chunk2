  it 's something, 
  muh luxury clothing !, 
  good idea , so when the infection picks millions because we did n't helped soon enough and it 's too late to help them we can only close the borders . 
  also  you should try and protect your own life over the lives of some random african strangers . 
  it 's not how a medic acts, 
  one of the worst curse you can say in chinese is `` be ready for interesting times '',

  i would add that your teeth are very good, 
  sorry , my english is not that good, 
  you should know that southern italy is italy in hard-core mode . 
  naples is italy in extreme mode, 
  ** italy ** * food is actually marvelous . 
  you move 20 kilometres and you find a different cuisine with its specialities * we are disorganised . 
  bureaucracy is a mess here * the tipical italian is not keen to follow the rules , any set of rules ( cultural , religious , etc ) * we drink a lot of coffee . 
  there is an endless variation of them * we are not lousy , northern europeans are too quiet , 
  i should visit, 
  i think it 's because of her angry brows glasses, 
  yes please, 
  how did you called my mother ? 
  now , if that would happen to italy too it would be wonderful, 
  the highest point was before the introduction of euro and now the amount is descending , right ?

  lol luxembourg and switzerland, 
  italian cinema industry produces either very good or terrible movies, 
  is mt. 
  ours , and a very close second is turkish and french . 
  swiss and belgians make amazing desserts too, 
  how good the state is managed, 
  hopeless hasshats , the leader has just come back from north korea saying it 's an example for italy, 
  but you are an autonomous region , you spend your own money !,

  [ we of soviet now ] ( http://www.lastampa.it/italia/speciali/elezioni/2014/mappe/europee#/e/2014-05-25/r/italy ),

  portugal !, 
  wonderful country , only a somewhat weird language, 
  may the union last a thousand years, 
  they have one of the strongest eastern accent i 've ever heard and they wrote the slogans in a clearly wrong italian . 
  2/10 try again but i do believe they were helped by italian communist , the group is in dispair and they completely disappeared in the italian political scene, 
  i can smell the fear, 
  rome ( and naples ) is in an extreme decadence . 
  sponsored restoration has been already made , and they did n't lead to a disneyficaton at all . 
  if the state keeps spending a mere 1,1 % [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/07kajkj.jpg ) we ca n't do much .

  translator does n't seemto work on the page , what does it says ? 
  ok , i find your comment the most shareable and i wrote mine impulsively . 
  i simply find not accettable to try to impose your vision in the country that adopted you also in my opinion  they did tell people not to drink , listen to music , visit prostitutes and alike ( and used yellow cards to inform about that )  allegedly they hindered people from entering a club and followed some who did n't lsiten to them ( police tells there might be a video which shows it / the waz a local newpaper which does n't always takes time to look up the facts reports it )  the people might be from radical salafist circles ( in germany this means much less than terrorists )  people felt threatened  wuppertal 's police tells to call them if you see this group or are feeling pressured , is more than what an evangelical group does, 
  things like these should n't happen . 
  i hope they get expelled, 
  we need a `` it 's happening '' gif with salmond 's face, 
  it 's that, 
  sorry for being so late we suffer the condition of having the vatican and its solid grip in most of the state affairs also in the period when other countries made the reforms we had the infamous berlusconi governments ...
