  mosquitos breed in stagnant waters , not trees, 
  as long they pay us to waste their money i 'm ok, 
  in italy okay -  acceptable, 
  seafood is really appreciated in italy too , what we consider bad is when you mix sweet and salty ingredients, 
  litterally german nationalsocialists, 
  wha-whats with the flair ???? 
  moooooooooods, 
  we are having a super bright and warm day in northern italy, 
  writing data -  propaganda for left-wing parties ok then, 
  the north remembers, 
  no please , enlighten me, 
  ha , i want to see them, 
  at least they tried to put a pattern on the concrete ... 
  you know shit 's bad when you have to do a reassurance tour after a month of presidency, 
  it 's not the temperature the real problem imho , the sunless months are much worse, 
  as someone who lives just over the coastal border that 's how i would describe my city, 
  it 's nizza duh, 
  googling it gives me the city of sebenico , it 's funny how every city in the coast has an italian demonym, 
   lukashenko imposed a 270 dollars/year tax for all those unemployed , which is absurd cause unemployed people usually have no money by definition , to be able to pay it . 
  does lukashenko wants riots ? 
  because that is how you get riots, 
  it 's all fun and games and then portugal attacks, 
  oh boy , the cheese song, 
  ten minutes later nothing is intact anymore, 
       crazy that there are so many people living there . 
  jobs, 
  wow , you are putting dubai to shame, 
  italy is campaigning hard to get ema , so is portugal, 
  dude , i think you are going toulouse it, 
  can confirm it , used as a tourist and it was really easy, 
  confirmation bias + ignorance + malevolence, 
  if we take conclusions by upvoted posts bernie would be the emperor of the world, 
  poor estonia , baltic when it wants to be nordic , nordic when it wants to be baltic, 
  migros or coop goddamn sticker to use the highways even for once washing machine in the basement , near the nuclear bunker, 
  lol '09, 
  shhhhh !, 
  haha she 's so tall, 
  probably not , but after three generations is reasonable, 
  is the caspian boiling ? 
  litterally the kgb, 
  their parents one, 
  60 % are ( were ) italians , yes, 
  haha huge sapienza vibes ( even if the city is modeled over sorrento ), 
  the cultural appropriation is out of control !!, 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ want ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ try ^ ^ ^ it, 
  much diversity , such style, 
  but i am le tired ... 
  you got to hurry up with those fusion reactors, 
  stop !, 
  you godless heatens, 
  absolute barbary, 
  the crawling babies seal it, 
  what chicken, 
  you can experience the thrill of living under the martial law without the risk of being imprisoned !, 
  everyone knows you stole it from ivory coast, 
  tfw ireland is bigger than you, 
  the netherlands laugh at you, 
  i 've never looked at a karelian pie before this video ... 
  i did it , was indeed great, 
  the only program that could do it is gazebo imho, 
  i thought that we reached the peak when [ fucking namibia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npkdoev6vyo ) joined the banter , but this is a gift that keeps on giving, 
  that 's why i think that it does n't work well with marine , she has such a low meme factor, 
  bad timing really there are also reports that saa and turkish backed rebels have started shooting each other , putting ruaf in weird position, 
  italy crusty !, 
  assert pizza dominance, 
  http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2016/5/italian-chefs-create-mile-long-neapolitan-to-break-longest-pizza-record-429657 nah, 
  nsfl tag please, 
  ** [ g\u00f6tterfunken intensifies ] **, 
  they have both been built, 
  you maniac give us our groceries !, 
  slipperly banana slope, 
  countries last longer than leaders, 
  this is what happens if you act aggressively . 
  no friends around you, 
  http://everysecondcounts.eu/ start with netherlands, 
  hugely more positive , what happened ? 
  [ it was a precision job ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h2nyl0k.jpg ) i wonder how it happened, 
  fridges of europe ? 
  or the nudes as reparation, 
  [ you know , this is partially your fault . . ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/the-surge-of-pro-trump-fake-news-is-coming-from-macedonia/8003094 ), 
  genoa , italy 395 $ ( all transports , even train ), 
  that 's dirty cheap, 
  it 's never too late to do that , russia has an industry and resources , saudi arabia is litterally a desert, 
  considering he has just been elected president i would say no, 
  the wrong uk flag hit the vexillologist in me, 
  history can be weird , also spaniards are super progressive, 
  we are proud of you romania, 
  is n't the situation `` good '' and improving in lombardy ? 
  haha i still remember during an interview `` and this is the biggest project we realised '' `` it 's very nice '' `` yes , it comes from when we still had the money * watery eyes * '' i was like `` dude you are still a rich multinational , wtf '', 
  it 's mostly a system of favors and a political perspective that does n't go over two years because that 's basically how long a government lasts . 
  you ca n't manage a country day by day, 
  massive debt , economy sustained by hundred of thousands of micro enterpreneurs that collapsed collectively with the crisis , failure of economical and political renovation ( basically twenty years of circlejerking ) , lack of capital , blatant misuse of money and populism, 
  this is a result , not the reason, 
  while looking for a job in tn people keep telling me how the situation was terrible job wise in the previous 3-4 years, 
  after the famous ddemagogue we had the austerity technician and the overpromising demagogue , and now we have the transition government . 
  situation does not look good for the next election, 
  they prefer to stay in the baguettosphere, 
  so three times, 
  it 's bangkok \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  as usual we are a sausage party :|,
