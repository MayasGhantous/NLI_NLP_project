  calico cats are domestic cats with a spotted or particolored coat that is predominantly white , with patches of two other colors ( often , the two other colors are orange and black ) . 
  because genetic determination of coat colors in calico cats is linked to the x chromosome , calicoes are nearly always female , with one color linked to the maternal x chromosome and a second color linked to the paternal x chromosome . 
  thanks for subscribing to cats facts !, 
  graphs + cats + europe = karma,

  eh , he said multiple times that his government is tied to the reforms the main issue with the referendum in my opinion is that brings much more than the senate change in a single vote and is not risolutive for the legislation ( for example the senate stays but beomes completely useless ) he also has all of the other parties against ( they really want to eliminate him ) and even fringes of his own party !, 
  the situation is not good at all,
