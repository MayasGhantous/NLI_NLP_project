  the pre-tax profit amounted to $ 494.4 million , up by 20.8 million euros ( + 4.4 % ) compared to the first half of 2016 . 
  income taxes amounted to 143.9 million euro and decreased by 6.8 million euros compared to the corresponding period of 2016 ( -4.5 % ) essentially due to the reduction in the ires rate from 27.5 % to 24 % for 2017 . 
  therefore , the tax rate for the period is 29.1 % compared with 31.8 % first semester of 2016 . 
  the total investments made by the terna group in the first six months of 2017 , amounting to $ 325.7 million , are in line with guidance 2017 of the strategic plan , compared with $ 346.9 million in the first half of the year , previous year . 
  among the major projects of the period are the advances of the italian-montenegro and italy-france electrical site construction sites , the works for the completion of the electrical connection between capri and the italian peninsula ( completed at the end of june 2017 ) and works in the venetian lagoon .

  is this a text based adventure ? 
  * nothing happens *, 
  debt , burocracy , austerity that crippled our economy after the crisis , an entire economy thet was based on small and medium business that got pruned , etc, 
  now i 'm conflicted, 
  urbanism \u00e0 la corbusier , but faster,

  there is the same stereotype, 
  shocking considering they are in front of our coasts, 
  subtle, 
  not really . 
  sa is a decreasing power , they burn 90 billions of $ every month because of the oil price , ca n't even fight succesfully the tribes of yemen with the second most funded army in the world and are losing most of the influence in the me to iran . 
  the next years will be very challenging for them, 
  you fight for the title with montenegro iirc, 
  are you ashens ?

  ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ our ^ ^ ^ secret ^ ^ ^ plan ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ occupy ^ ^ ^ scandinavia ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ working , ^ ^ ^ nice ... * cough * i mean how terrible !, 
  hyperboles are the worst thing in the world, 
  i do n't see postmodernism here, 
  seems like stefano boeri found a nice niche, 
  terrible , but it is probably a temporary solution ( that will last decades ... ) before the building is uncovered to be restored properly, 
  why , i could n't think a worse way to go, 
  ugh people in italy trying to have a light conversation over what 's popular right now , my nerves !, 
  you are on a good track, 
  i want to see one in the wild, 
   poland i knew it !,

  you could n't eat them anyway without teeth now, 
  ( it was an invite to tell us some ), 
  some stuff that people generally do n't know ? 
  so no nuts ? 
  the cringe is real, 
  `` i say the missile goes over ! '', 
  `` see angela , we in the east have this thing called iron curtain ... '', 
  it makes great leaders apparently, 
  what the hell are they talking about ? 
  something about jumping a fence ? 
  why only aerial animals ? 
  will anyone think of the poor moles ? 
  head-in-a-vat mutti then ? 
  they have fiscal autonomy and they are part of eu anyway, 
  rightful italian clay !, 
  remove estonia and it 's perfect, 
  as someone who lives in a rich part of my country without being rich i can confirm it sucks, 
  kinky kinky french, 
  common sense !, 
  hooray !, 
  i really hope this post will [ fly ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gpczomd.jpg ) under mod 's radar, 
  i 'm still dubious how the alcantara will be after a few years , laptops get dirty very quickly, 
  dat obama potrait, 
  that 's correct , it 's the same people who appreciate both, 
  this map is old , here is the 2017 version https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trans-european_high-speed_rail_network#corridors, 
  see this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nonbuilding_structure,

  san marino stronk , mount titano tallest of yurop !, 
  it 's a tower , not a building, 
  world 's tallest fidget spinner, 
  so switzerland should have 100 meters tall chalets ? 
  postmodernism , not even once, 
  wtf i love uk now, 
  a man that was cool even with a neckbeard, 
  rotterdam is very different, 
  every time :(, 
  is half italys a iso standard ? 
  we will !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ after ^ ^ ^ ^ everyone ^ ^ ^ ^ else,
