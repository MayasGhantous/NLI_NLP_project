  please do it , barcelona is one of the most beautiful cities in europe, 
  we need to be quick before elon musk builds a sagrada familia in san francisco :(, 
  costantinoplians please, 
  / r/neoliberal is leaking, 
  the only other country with that name was upper volta i think, 
  sure !, 
  they are probably smart enough to work with the russian , they are ultimately anti sunni, 
  a lot of italian real estates also, 
  time to flatten that hill and reclaim the title, 
  luna = moon , luned\u00ec = moon-day, 
  especially those dressed as policemen !, 
  everyone i do n't like is a soros agent , right ? 
   mamamia do they want to switch a controversy for another ? 
  imho yes , the american election was a reality check for a lot of people , populists in europe who sided with him are being affected heavily, 
  they are truly unique in the political spectrum , you can never expect what policies they will support, 
  i 'm still worried of general elections . 
  there 's much that we can screw up, 
  nothing says he was n't already here, 
  alternative facts !, 
  kind of good one tho, 
  i wish i have the convincing capabilities of calatrava, 
  this is clearly tongue in cheek, 
  it 's not that is a forgotten civilisation with no influence in the present, 
  really , travelling has become super inexpensive, 
  it is barely functional as capital of italy, 
  i think that he 'll be remembered forever like alexader, 
  boooo , that is not brutalism . 
  brutalism can be often very good , visit / r/brutalism, 
  the horror !, 
  probably she/he will have red hair, 
  no reversals sadly, 
  you could say they ran with the load, 
  how nice is it that you can read the news in five languages,

  [ sure ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wdi4taqpkm ), 
  but can it count the inserted fingers ? 
  western and southern africa are kind of ok . 
  the real mess start from angola and reaches sudan, 
  `` yes , i 'm writing from the prison '', 
  who manages this fund ? 
  is it an pan-european mechanism ? 
  if you ask you ca n't afford it, 
  it 's not his voice i was hearing in my head, 
  they should do some kind of competition to prove it . 
  thanks , now it will be stuck in my head again for days, 
  paging / u/godsdog23 , our very unique lichtensteiner to comment what other people said, 
  honestly they are circlejerking quite hard for someone who just became president ^ ^ not ^ ^ envious ^ ^ at ^ ^ all, 
  you risk moving back to 50s and join north korea, 
  thanks for the nightmares, 
  what the hell, 
   a turkish boat with tourists saved them but the migrants decided to hijack the boat and restrain the captain once they got on board . 
  it was an elaborate ruse, 
  `` we do n't even make an effort not to look evil '', 
  i love that hotel , the whole area is a postmodern dream, 
  you can also see the soon dissolution of any left or right as of late, 
  `` probably '', 
  you forgot the earthquakes for added instability :d, 
  silly you , no one would intentionally do that, 
  you can build modern beautiful buildings tho . 
  building a newtown in the style of the past would look like disneyland, 
  gouda and delft city hall look very similar , but delft has also a very nie cathedral behind it, 
  amsterdam is amazing but invaded by tourists ( also not the good one kind ) . 
  if you move a little from the tourit path you can find amazing places like borneo sporenburg, 
  true , best looking dutch city imho, 
  what if terrorist learn martial arts ? 
  the islamists are sitting there beating their dicks to some midget porn , when they suddenly realize that it would be nice to bang some virgins , so they grab their knifes , and go absolutely harambe . 
  hahaha what a funny typo , yes ^ ^ ^ boys ^ ^ ^ go ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ him, 
  why tho , to get mike `` white sharia '' pence next ?

  fastvenia . 
  as long as the minister is n't a sch\u00e4uble 2.0, 
  hollande happened, 
  the second one, 
  i love the hundred italians coming to estonia i bet it 's for the girls, 
  ugh , typical italian self-pity, 
  less expensive ? 
  also right after the border there 's como lake , hardly `` a mess '', 
  politics , but unironically fought as teenagers, 
  probably cheap and nice to retire with a swiss benefit, 
  cyprus ? 
  i 'm mostly surprised by the movement of dutch -  belgium , belgians -  france , french -  spain south is the new west ? 
  no , but it could be much better , mismanagement and clientelism is clear if you are a roman, 
  i want to see some of his paints, 
  meanwhile i have to work in an open space :(, 
  hair !, 
  low resolution !, 
  what is this madness ? 
  this is gold hahaha, 
  goddamn speakers meddling with the president !, 
  considering the amount of suicides and falling number of children i 'd say no, 
  `` yes , yes ... let the eurofederalism flow in you '',
