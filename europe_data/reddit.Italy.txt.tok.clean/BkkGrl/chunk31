  with trump now everyone sees what happens, 
  ** [ 1812 intensifies ] **, 
  we had a splash test here also , but  5 % are covered, 
  i see you are using led stripes too in the crossings, 
  people would complain that `` russia controls the eu and it only works in its favour '' as they do with germany, 
  the situation would probably get ten times worse, 
  there 's nothing scary , all metropolis work that way . 
  comparably china has more tha 100 cities with  1m population, 
  hehe greetings,

  can you lend us him for the winter ? 
   yes , imo greek debt should be completely eliminated . 
  they need an haircut , but an elimination would be very unfair to the other countries that are repaying it fully, 
  well there 's that giuliani picture ... ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ thanks !, 
  we are doing a terrible job then, 
  a value italy can believe in, 
  me too !,

  may 15 1768 worst year of muh life !, 
  \\  republican \\  non interventionist choose one, 
  of course !, 
  yes !, 
  uh , til, 
  my friends managed to invite them the first time for the mojotic . 
  they liked so much the place that came again and dedicated a song to sestri, 
  it is like this because after the fascism the fathers of the republic designed the leadership to be very easy to be overtrown to avoid a dictatorship . 
  this system is still in use and we just had a referendum to improve governability but it failed . 
  uh , mecca is surprisingly low considering you have to do at least once in your life if you are muslim, 
  big if true,

  big if true, 
  the fuck , just do n't call it pizza, 
  you can still visit, 
  soon \u2122, 
  terrible , we should send aids, 
  nah , but they moved from existing only in anti-berlusconi function to being anti anyone-who-isn ` t-m5s and shilling hard, 
  but you are landlocked !, 
  no our privacy authority already said `` do n't even think about it '', 
  yes , litterally, 
  wtf rutracker is banned ? 
  how is it so popular then ? 
  he was 70 back then , totally different thing, 
  at 80 is kinda late, 
  he matured a lot ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s , now he has a 31 yo gf, 
  attitude is crucial, 
  never change silvio :'), 
  he 's every italian embarassing uncle,

  what if he did all of this to reach merkel ? 
  breaking news `` french trump chosen as pm '' . 
  following , `` chocolatine , are they racist ? '', 
       jesus fuck , so now we 're advocating intervention in venezuela so that we can take their oil ? 
  * buy also venezuela 's oil is terrible and we were barely buying it, 
   like - who do you even support in syria ? 
  right now is an horrorific dictator vs al qaeda , vs kurds ( that are already overextending a lot their territory and are hated by their neighbours ) vs litterally isis it is a mess, 
  they are having a tourism boom, 
  maison de cartes, 
  well done portubros !, 
  catania is really underrated, 
  june and september are probably the best months to visit, 
  thank you for some curated comment with links on the issue !, 
  there is way too much partisanship for this topic . 
   scotland in the eu would need to join the euro and schengen , creating a hard border with the rest of the uk , with whom scotland does 4x more trade than with the eu combined . 
  scotland could not join the common travel area between the uk and ireland , as that agreement dates from 1922 , and uk and irish eu membership was formed around that existing agreement . 
  ireland is not in shengen but it has no problem , how would that cause friction with the cta ? 
   but some guy in ~ ~ murica ~ ~ france decided to get rid of him because of reasons . 
  ftfy, 
  i like how they managed to include a revolver there,

  not really in sicily . 
  it is very popular for internal italian tourism tho, 
  it 's open source , also you can load a list that makes you invisible to the anti adblockers, 
   \u00a8 after several years of careful deliberation the british public has resoundingly voted to reapply for membership to the european union . \u00a8 meanwhile anus has joined the eu, 
  wait , what ?

  i turned on the tv when there was the montenegro exibition i turned off my tv, 
  the best ones also, 
  it has , but migrants generally move north when they have an opportunity, 
  [ `` some '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_serbia_to_the_european_union ), 
  this is not true , they stopped using bombs a long time ago because they wanted to be as elusive as possible my bet is anarchist/angry citizen, 
  shitty move . 
  movies are movies , you ca n't barrage some because you do n't like a platform, 
  the heresy must be stopped, 
  they just love tourists \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  the only application i could ever support is / u/executivemonkey one, 
  this accelerator is making me euphoric,
