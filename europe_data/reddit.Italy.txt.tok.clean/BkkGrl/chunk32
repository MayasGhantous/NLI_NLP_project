  probably absolutely nothing , maybe hazelnut picker, 
  correct !, 
  climate change do n't reduce the population , it creates a massive wave of desparate immigrants that try to reach richer countries, 
  some areas are off ( ie bulgaria and greece ), 
  immigration and lots of land do that to you, 
  do n't tell the congolese, 
  they prefer the current situation compared to 1991 or 1998 . it 's understandable , but they are still axploited like crazy, 
  time to start a voluntary sterilisation like they did in india, 
  til, 
  if they pay you beforehand it does, 
  mostly kuwait who bought 7b $ of eurofighters,

  we are the second country by number of aircraft carrier, 
   the italian f-35b has to be certified for electromagnetic environmental effects in order to fly off italy 's sole carrier cavour . 
  why everyone always forgets our poor [ garibaldi aircraft carrier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_aircraft_carrier_giuseppe_garibaldi ), 
  have you ingested a genocide ? 
   ketchup and parmesan for my seafood gnocchi ? 
  i 'm having a stroke, 
  remove kebab remove kebab enrico dandolo aliv in venice, 
  but reusables can only get better , while single use ca n't be improved that much . 
  we should really rush toward reusables, 
  no , living trees are really hard to set on fire, 
  evasionception,

   everybody expected this i did n't know,

  we are going to get a new wave of pay denbts polandballs, 
  way too many elections this year, 
  we are kind of stuck in italy, 
  hashemites run eu ? 
  are you sure you want even more troubled regions ? 
  i do n't know why the downvotes , this is actually very true, 
  i like what i 'm seeing, 
  [ i think is a reference to this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bpxf5tv.png ), 
  til also russia has navy seals, 
   c-27j spartan til we produce military transports, 
  secret services will scramble to retrive the intelligence from the vessel, 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russian-navy-ship-crash-black-sea-liman-istanbul-coast-livestock-vessel-a7705401.html tl ; dr a russian naval reconnaissance ship has sunk after it crashed into a freighter carrying livestock in the black sea , near turkey . 
  that reassures me . 
  i 'm planning to come back, 
  there 's barely any economic communism left in china ... 
  they move as fast as they can north, 
  as a ligurian ugh , che crisis hit so hard here and in piedmont, 
  yeah , definitely where 's the problem of sicily come from, 
  god damn food of the gods . 
  the sad thing is that you ca n't find as good as the sicilian ones outside sicily, 
  pizza is n't tipical of sicily, 
  there have n't been homicides for a long time , but this also means that the crime is almonst an istitution there now, 
  much better in just 5 months ? 
  that 's a 30 % growth yoy , we must send help to them asap !, 
  i 'm picturing a future where northern ireland reunites with ireland and suddenly you find yourself in the eu again, 
  you ca n't really control an angry mob ... 
  how 's almendrales ? 
  i would be there, 
  all my teachers and professors looked terrible, 
  http://www.swfinstitute.org/fund-rankings/ japanese pension fund and us social security are bigger , but still incredible for a 5m country, 
  cheers ireland , the future looks bright !, 
  thanks mr playboy, 
  pasta with zucchini and mozzarella, 
  there 's clearly an inflammation problem, 
  it 's like they are normal people !, 
  ok , maybe not most of the world but the trend is evident http://i.imgur.com/37jmmua.png and even china is under replacemt numbers, 
  again ignoring the spectrum . 
  from the page you linked [ this is good architecture ] ( http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/540/bqtpsz.jpg ) but [ this is laughable ] ( http://photos1.zillowstatic.com/p_h/is10cvpwi3mbezn.jpg ) . 
  they do n't cut your hands if you do n't use only glass in contemporary architecture, 
  my eyes !, 
  cheerful place !, 
  sorry but there is some good concepts mixed with a high level of bullshittery there . 
  using the iconoclast period of modernism to describe today architecture is wrong and the generic style of the glass cube is considered not valuable and wo n't last long as countless buildings of the past . 
  i know some people would love to restart neoclassicism but we already did that and it 's called disneyland, 
  it 's not , france gives great incentives for families , it is known, 
  most of the world is like this . 
  you can only offer strong incentives for families , but yu ca n't force people to procreate, 
  yeah , but at least they do n't tamper mail !, 
  i for one welcome our frog overlords, 
  chechnya is one of those places that would need an actual wall around them shit will hit the fan hard there when oil will start to be abandoned, 
  so europe will be france soon, 
  1351 in a year is barely a trend to be honest, 
  yeah , i 've seen they are rebuilding all the facades in blaak for a more appealing look also and oh man , how good is centraal now, 
  this is laststagecapitalism material, 
  another proof of climate change obviously, 
  tell that to k\u00f6nigsberg ... 
  the city today is amazingly good looking imho, 
  ugh , this is like three times what we are getting, 
  it 's hard to feel the march of progress when you 've been unemployed for years ... 
  we are pessimist and we hate ourselves, 
  the last 10 years were kind of rough for the eu, 
  it 's not , but it still has a big autocracy problem, 
  maybe it even made some new !,
