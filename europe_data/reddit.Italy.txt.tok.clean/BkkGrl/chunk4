  i 'm starting to believe there 's you behind global warming, 
  goddamn nordics . 
  i envy you so much, 
  about the infamous italian situation a lot of youngsters here still lives with the parents because : * insanely high price for renting a house ( i could afford living on my own only dividing the rent with four roomates ) * high unemployment * no help at all by the government also for many of them they have residence in our parent 's house because we pay lower taxes but they live elsewhere, 
  lost it at caff\u00e8 con muffa,

  wow , germany can be crazy beautiful, 
  how are they ? 
  i travel every day in a ab train and it 's very nice , but i heard the ones we sold to the netherlands were terrible, 
  also the movie is worth watching, 
  italy had the best position in the ancient world in the center of the mediterranean sea , controling most of the commerce, 
  dude , making a tunnel takes ages, 
  yes but he has [ has seven trials at the moment ] ( http://www.ilpost.it/2013/10/24/processi-berlusconi-infografica/ ) he 's not going to have a good time , and this makes me happy,

  i guess i have seen the camorra as one organism , not several fighting each other . 
  have to read up on the camorra again . 
  they are really a horrible lot . 
  watch the movie `` gomorra '' , it 's one of the best italian movies in the last few years, 
   berlusconi refounded his party are we in a time machine ? 
  they do dump stuff in the sea and somewhere else , but mafia is not a single organisation , they are rival clans . 
  if you are going to release somewhere the wast , better doing in the rival neighborhood , even if you both finish poisoned , it 's a poor men 's war, 
  you are implying that mafia has some regard to the people , they just want to gain more money and control on that land, 
  nope , they dump in their very own land , there is even the famous sentence `` who cares , we dring mineral water '' that was taped and became iconic,

  being that high is a miracle , italy used to recycle nothing, 
  agree . 
  he tried so many times to change the costitution and become president of the republic , but he never managed to achieve that, 
  terrible situation ... 
  mafia has a century long history in the south and the roots are deep in administration , a lot has been done but they are not going to disappear anytime soon, 
  it 's like empty the sea with a pitchfork , but still a good thing,
