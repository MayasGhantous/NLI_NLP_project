  our navy is n't `` stretched '' and our government is barely asking help for everyone in the union 's good measure , considering most of the immigrants move immediatly to northener countries . 
  their only program is `` stop the invasion '' and the solution they want to push is to shoot the ships . 
   ` invisible enemy ' smells too much like a conspiracy theory to me because it is , they look constantly for scapegoats . 
  for them the main problems are immigrants , roma people , germany , bruxelles , etc. . .

  visiting norway it seemed to me that was composed of only an homogeneous middle class , very down to earth people, 
  a lot of people is attracted by fascism, 
  ff loaded an html5 player for me, 
  they are probably twice the italian or french reditors,

  i find more ironic that prostitutes would accept food vouchers as a payment . 
  also il giornale is a very biased source ( berlusconi personal newspaper ) and has a strong agenda in news,

   gdp growth in second quarter : 0.9 % q/q , 4.4 % y/y .

   average wage of $ 1000/month in 2015 , but now average is $ 300-400 has someone believed that ?
