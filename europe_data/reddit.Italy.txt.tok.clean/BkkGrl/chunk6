  ah the wonders of germanic language ... what is happening btw ? 
  amazingly beautiful, 
  * what did you say *, 
  do n't link zerohedge , that 's a very bad source, 
  oh please , all of them ? 
  have you visited bolzano ? 
  where ? 
  they should have tasered him, 
  spain and italy , so similar yet so different . 
  i wonder why, 
  i 'm currently sharing an apartment with five housemates , and i say you still ca n't, 
  you can survive , not live, 
  southern italy understands you, 
  smug , smelly , inferior food and wine, 
  no one told me the future could be so weird, 
  is this actual growth or just a bounce from the recession ? 
  ligurians mock people from sardinia and lombardy , everyone mock ligurians because they are greedy , veneto is mocked being the redneck of the north , north mock the south and viceversa and so on ... we liked to mock the french too , but we are in a period of exceptionally low self-esteem now , so we kinda stopped, 
  liechtenstein ca n't into gender, 
  brutal, 
   ca n't believe the italians have a better rep than us . 
  the whole south is basically mafiosi . 
  shout your mouth if you do n't want to find an horse head in your bed, 
  all yours, 
  the economist strips are so superficials , i hate them also labels everywhere, 
  what 's the problem serb-croat ? 
  this out-onions the onion . 
  but i mean , they can keep it anyway , even if it 's not likely :(, 
  [ here a map of famous cheese from italy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/veqx4io.jpg ) thanks to / u/diobrando89 here the transaltion of the map key ( legenda ) : green dot = cow milk . 
  red dot = sheep milk . 
  yellow dot = goat milk . 
  blue dot = buffalo milk . 
  = protected designation of origin . 
  = ark of taste . 
  alp = produced from pastures in the alp mountains . 
  = produced from pastures in islands and the appennine mountains . 
  cas = produced by cheese factories in valleys . 
  pkg = weight in kg . 
  scm = thickness in cm . 
  pd = hard paste .

  it is legal in certified casinos , and there are like four of them in italy , in venice , campione , sanremo etc, 
  not suspicious at all, 
  it 's like 38 \u00b0 outside now and i have honestly some problems working because of the heat i may consider an ac with this global warming thing going ... 
  w la foca, 
  has n't the recent devaluation of the euro helped ? 
  it is actually doing wonders to export dependant countries ( namely italy and germany ) ... 
  we just took a nap 15 years long, 
  are they still considered important alies for putin because of the oil or their relevance is decreasing ? 
  yeah you are right , but at least we should have civil unions, 
  old map [ the fall has already stopped ] ( http://blogs-images.forbes.com/markadomanis/files/2015/05/russiaintlreserves.png ) source http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2015/05/25/russias-international-reserves-have-stopped-declining-for-now/, 
  the centrist part follows renzi , so they favour the proposal , the ncd is the problem norther league , forza italia and ncd are against , but they are probably a minority in case of a vote, 
  i 'm pretty sure he was joking, 
  i understand , but it 's not my opinion . 
  also the graph says exactly the opposite ... 
  i found it actually cheaper . 
  visit the coast , and of course lisbon, 
  visit portugal , it 's really worth it, 
  we do n't have many reasons to hate them, 
  low self esteem ( or just decadent empire syndrome ), 
  our far right is absolutely in love with putin btw, 
  that 's germany, 
  i 'm not really convinced about this chart , all the people i know loves france/goes to vacation to france or moved to france . 
  also russia is nowhere that hated, 
  the government has been cautious because we had massive investments in russia , but we finally agreed for all the sanctions, 
  `` we are the worst '' `` no , we are the worst '', 
  the eesticirclejerk is alreay strong here my friend, 
  you and spin0 have both the tag `` economy guy who actually gives souces '', 
  ... i still prefer to live in the ez, 
  golden, 
  not balkanise itself, 
  both italy and uk are artificial imho , they are already built on different regions . 
  if italy managed to remain a nation with tirol and sicily , why should n't europe integrate the nations ? 
  i swear , our growth now is litterally driven just by low euro and qe, 
  next stop north africa, 
  in my opinion both conditions can exist , we should become a federation of states , determined by the local culture, 
   http://blog.ilgiornale.it/rossi/files/2015/05/matteo-renzi.jpg hence the nickname renzie ( from happy days fonzie ), 
  ** [ netherlandness intensifies ] **, 
  they move where the money are, 
       erm , 23 % is significant ? 
  ok . keep us updated nonetheless . 
  it is , they already want to vote the bill , in a case of vote it could be an avalanche, 
  weed is already everywhere in italy , they better start taxing it soon, 
  the elections made it pretty clear that brits love them, 
  no mention rule please, 
  as you said the government would lose just accountability and the inefficiency cycle would continue . 
  maersk would lose a lot of money for mismanagement , and there 's nothing a business hates more than losing money . 
  maersk is a solid company , and they will expand a lot the potential imho, 
  rightfully venice clay , gib back, 
  this is / r/vexillology dream fridge, 
  also the vittoriano , ugh ugliest monument in rome,
