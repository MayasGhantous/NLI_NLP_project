  maybe a 5th generation jet technology really is difficult to achieve as now, 
  i 'll send a memo to un for no conflicts until that date, 
       now that the t-50 is falling apart ( literally and figuratively ) , uh , i did n't know that , do you have a citation ? 
  also thay are probably still bitter for the aircraft carrier affair, 
  never gets old, 
  something something exporting democracy ? 
  it could be an improvement, 
  it would create a clusterfuck of isolated enclaves, 
  have they checked under the bed ? 
   it 's a wonderful country . 
  so for a visitor , it 's pretty neat . 
  but living here is a different story . 
  but i guess this applies to all countries ever . 
  yup, 
  wtf why ? 
  dark, 
  european commission just trolled you, 
  this time we can stop pretending we do n't want to, 
  there is no conflict if no one 's alive, 
  and if we start crusading again the middle east * jerusalem 2 : this time is personal *, 
  i think that ageing is the real issue here, 
  but not albania !, 
  a teocracy , i want the papal state to rule the continent, 
   the european countries want to build a medium-sized drone capable of carrying weapons , ready for use by the year 2025 . do n't have too haste ... 
  nice move uk, 
  quoting brunetta , oh god ... 
  he 's like the personal ass cleaner of berlusconi , did n't they had a better figure to ask ? 
  italyworks for everyone !,

  [ same word , different thing ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=pasta+semolina&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=631&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=asgbvelrn4tlakiigygb&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq ),

  portuwhat ? 
       best way to inspire nationalism in a turk is to talk about food . 
  it 's our berzerk button lol . 
  til italians are basically turks, 
  someone has to fuel the was in middle east, 
  we 're gon na grope you so hard m8, 
   t there is no ` wallstr\u00f6m affair ' . 
  outside sweden , the western media has barely covered the story , and sweden 's eu allies have shown no inclination whatsoever to support her . 
  a small scandinavian nation faces sanctions , accusations of islamophobia and maybe worse to come , and everyone stays silent . 
  as so often , the scandal is that there is n't a scandal . 
  this is absolutely correct . 
  italian news never covered the story . 
  props to this courageous politician, 
  top quality swearing m8 :d, 
  carlomagno , yes, 
  whataboutism at its finest, 
  very cool redirecter,

  good thing there is tagging in res, 
  the crimea logo looks cool, 
  fun fact !, 
  the fiore 's new force is so right leaning that when you become a member they send you a police baton !, 
  they are the main allies of golden dawn in italy, 
  marvelous . 
  i have no knowledge in military tech , but the japanese and korean are the most sexy to me, 
   like this infamous one from the eu [ 1 ] hahaha what the hell is this, 
  while we are talking about this , we could have fiume back ... 
  actually our first video that is n't a cringefest , thanks for posting !, 
  you do have a badass cathedral neverthless, 
  i know this is best for european stability overall , but i hoped for something interesting to happen . 
  and broke his ankles , yes, 
  excellent, 
  fuck this bot, 
  also the world gets rid of sarah palin , excellent, 
  someone who it 's always been close to the americans ... 
  i know !,

  this ... this mean that everything is a conspiracy made by pacifists ? 
  every big city is cabled with fiber now , no worries, 
  they nsa 'd us !, 
  alert !, 
  f35 is intended to replace every other model of warplane we have, 
  everyone 's opinion , but it 's not everywhere sadly :(, 
  [ goddamn froggies did that ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vespa_150_tap ), 
  just out of curiosity , do occupied ( squatting ) buildings exist in geneva or switzerland ? 
  alice was killed , now it 's just telecom adsl, 
  meh , i will never feel too proud of a succesful weapon industry . . 
  joining a currency when it 's low is probably good , you do a fixed change and when it will bounce back you will made a lot of money, 
  please read everything by gabriel garc\u00eda m\u00e1rquez , his books are abolute classics, 
  the dude looks healty as fuck honestly . 
  all of this looks a lot like wishful thinking, 
       michal na ostrove ( michael on island ) the beautiful archipelago of slovakia !, 
  goddamn barbarians sacking muh rome !,
