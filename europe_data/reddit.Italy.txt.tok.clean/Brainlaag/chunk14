  the main export being diamonds ? 
  next to all the goods belgium is renowned for , waffles , beer , etc. 
  it 's bloody diamonds . 
  absolutely , even better would be globally . 
   i spend too much time on a certain subreddit that involves comics with spheric countries . 
  ah yes , so what about those hands ? 
  how did you make that jump from my two word comment ? 
  i think making the jump from under $ 80 gdp ppp with an inexistent production sector and sub par living conditions , to an industrial powerhouse , just under $ 1800 gdp ppp and vastly improved social services and safety nets is nothing short of impressive and basically incomparable to any country with non-fixed government . 
  define what better means , as subjective as it may be . 
  is a meal on your table better than being able to fly a flag of your choice ? 
  is the ability to voice your opinion preferable to having no livelihood ? 
  is the choice of who might fuck up as leader better than having actual improvements of the economical conditions ? 
  comparing either to me seems pointless , fact being , korea would not be what it is today without park , perhaps it would n't be even considered western , however a lot of things play a role , such as that particular nation being of big interests to the us as bulwark against the soviets in asia , although investments alone hardly do anything if the necessary stability to set things in motion does not exist . 
  park assured that stability . 
  legalising drugs and sex workers would bite off a gigantic chunk of revenue , let alone the reduced violence . 
  despite all his flaws , it was a net loss for the balkans . 
  south korea under park chung-hee .

  quantity = / = quality , he did not say they do it less , merely that they suck more at it . 
  woops , seems like my memory is n't as good as i thought and i merely meant of the bigger states , disregarding things like rhode island , new hampshire and the like but i 'm surprised at how few wyoming has . 
  on a side note , i thought merely about the continental us , without alaska , otherwise hawaii would be ahead of it too , let alone the territories . 
  hmmm , perhaps i thought of wyoming , is it a backwards hillbilly state ?

  the least densely populated american state and the one most distant from the shining beacon of civilisation . 
  beautiful nature tho , although that can be said about many other states , the remoteness helps i suppose . 
  ... said the bully . 
  while i see where you are coming from , that mentality is a very dangerous one . 
  if now people were to shift their attention to the main culprit of not only greenhouse gases but all sorts of pollutants , the agriculture , the by far the most polluting and damaging sector ( globally ) , then the outlook for the future might be somewhat positive . 
  it 's ironic really , it 's a sector we have the most influence over with our daily routines and yet it gets so broadly ignored . 
  a shame that a serious problem like co2 has become a specter merely to mask an even bigger one . 
  that 's what i thought as well but reports ( such as the un one ) do in fact attribute a much greater deal of autonomy to the `` jamahiriya '' . 
  i suspect it 's merely that the most violent elements in that region , in this case the islamist , simply filled the vacuum that has been left behind in the wake of the bombings and the collapse of the government , since no opposition movements are as centralised and focused as the militant islamists , it 's the same pattern visible through out most of the other arab countries . 
  you have various groups working against the government , however they are not unified on a course of action and legislative matters later on , which then leads to a simple rule of the strongest . 
  keep avoiding the points of debate and carry on with the ad hominem , you sure are showcasing maturity . 
   you do n't earn much respect from me with this , but i was hoping you knew that in advance . 
  i 've heard stories like yours from conspiretards before . 
  unfortunately they 're never in short supply with regimes that rely on propaganda and psychological warfare . 
  i take that as a `` i know jack shit but pretend to stand above others due to my edgy high-school attitude '' . 
  if you consider the [ un general assembly ] ( http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/16session/a-hrc-16-15.pdf ) `` conspiretards '' , i really ca n't help you . 
   1 could you also be specific about something i did n't already chew up for you ? 
  leaving aside the ad hominem and complete lack of respect , on what basis do you come to this conclusion except for the usual hearsay ? 
  because so far you have n't strung a coherent sentence that is n't as vague as the the blue ocean and please , try to be specific , like he actively funded terrorist groups and events in ireland , the uk and germany . 
  which again raises the question , who 's morally absolved from these things ? 
  he was a dictator , a sole regent for a time being and had massive influence on the state afterwards ( mainly in the form of funneling away funds , since i doubt the sharia-law fragments were his idea but that is speculation ) but there are many nuances to it and the regional perspective is always different when it collides with opposing interests , let alone international ones . 
  let 's not forget in his later life gaddafi was quite the buddy with some european leaders . 
  especially this sentence :  all dictators always `` step up against the west '' to rile up their oppressed manhandled population against an external enemy . 
  shows your lack of understanding , considering not few dictators have been actively propped up/supported by western nations and those who were n't and became somewhat popular , came to power by ousting the prior regime imposed by the west ( see pinochet , mubarak , saddam , shah , batista , the prominent royal houses of the entire arab peninsula , etc. ) . 
  edit : spelling, 
  richest country on the continent , most job offers and a gathering pool for workers all around , on top of being one of the leading oil producers with a semi-independent route . 
  it also had the highest hdi ( edit : [ still has ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_african_countries_by_human_development_index ) ) , outperformed any other country in terms of innovation and [ social services ] ( http://countrystudies.us/libya/55.htm ) , thus your comment of `` fucked '' is not only incorrect but even relatively seen , unfounded . 
  people give the former libyan government 's corruption and the idolisation of gaddafi ( leaving aside his commitment to stepping up against the leading world powers , establish an african trade union and similar things that made him a prime target for western interests ) way too much shit , it 's far worst now and will not recover for a loooooong time . 
  edit : here is a comment regarding the perception towards gaddafi from a libyan and he explains how his name of `` brotherly leader '' came to be , as biased as it may be my personal experience with libyans is fairly similar :  i think you may have a slight misunderstanding of gaddafi 's true role in libya , which is understandable considering the decades long propaganda campaign against gaddafi and libya . 
  gaddafi and libya are subjects i am quite familiar with and i am more than happy to take the time to provide you with information . 
  gaddafi was n't the leader of libya when he died . 
  he had n't held formal office since early in the 70 's shortly after the bloodless coup . 
   the cult of personality that sprung up around gaddafi was largely because he was idolized among many libyans due to the prosperity and progress he helped facilitate , though he did play it up and used it to his advantage quite well . 
   as an example of the positive roll gaddafi had in libyan society , he and the libyan government had been slated to receive a reward from the un for their economic and social progress and for their commitment to human rights just a couple months prior to the nato destabilization of libya . 
  ( see the following link ) http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/16session/a-hrc-16-15.pdf  gaddafi was so loved for the reforms he created that many libyans honored his contribution by calling him the ` brother leader ' . 
  ( this is in part where the misconception comes in that gaddafi was a dictator . ), 
  it was a fitting informal title because he was not the officially recognized leader but he was highly revered among libyans . 
  he was basically the libyan george washington , who not only overthrew a corrupt monarchy but his policies took libya from being the poorest country in the world to the most prosperous in africa and one of the most prosperous in the me . 
  and all in a few decades !, 
  that is amazing . 
  gaddafi was a living hero . 
   as another example this video shows nearly 2 million libyans ( nearly one third the population of libya ) showing up in tripoli at green square to support gaddafi and oppose the nato bombings . 
  some important context to keep in mind is that prior to the green revolution , libya was a monarchy and libyans were used to having a prominent central governing figure , a king , before the peaceful coup in ' 69 . 
  so it was only natural that gaddafi would be depicted by his supporters ( the vast majority of libyans ) such a figure in some ways . 
  ultimately , gaddafi was merely a statesman and adviser to the system of direct democracy known as ` jamahiriya ' that he helped create , and it is a tragic irony that he was doomed in some ways by the very adoration of his fellow libyans . 
  [ indeed ] ( http://923thedock.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/road.jpg ) , [ quite the fitting example ] ( http://www.faithinreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/bad-road-300x199.jpg ) canada 's infrastructure is of course much better than russia 's but as said , winters are n't gentle to roads . 
  economic relief due to increased military expenditure is but a paper tiger with a very limited life expectancy . 
  unless you end up in a state of perpetual conflict , much like the us , this is nothing but a dead end that will give maybe a short breath of air before punching you right back in the stomach . 
  ask greece , [ one of the few states that exceeds nato expenditure demands by not a small margin . 
  ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ms.mil.xpnd.gd.zs/countries/1w?order=wbapi_data_value_2013%20wbapi_data_value%20wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=desc&amp;display=default ), 
  well put . 
  i said especially tundra ( due the fact that a good chunk of rural russia is in fact that and the ultra shitty roads are there mostly ) , not that it lies in one , moscow still has very cold winters and sochi is one of the most southern tips of the country , it 's like drawing the parallel between stockholm and florence . 
  australia has cold winters ? 
  ( i edited my previous comment btw ), 
  comrade , you have to understand politburo has priority and then vodka , roads are for decadent westerners . 
  also that stretch is still three times the size of germany just in one direction , besides you do n't want to know what cold winter does to roads , especially in tundra regions , it goes from frozen wasteland to mudville . 
  it 's pretty much what the kremlin wanted , a reason to rally the russian population , destabilisation and force other countries to relocate more funds towards military expenditures in times of crisis , the only one who 's going to eat shit is the average joe in each country . 
  [ and this was the shell used for it , mini tactical nuke . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/80cm_gustav_shell.jpg ) got ta hand it to nazi germany , megalomania was definitely not in short supply . 
  ca n't blame them with all the arctic regions , we all crave sun :p, 
  [ russia is also really ] ( http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/52a729436bb3f7c47766bfa7-800-/united-states-into-russia.jpg ) [ big . 
  ] ( http://new1.fjcdn.com/comments/privjet+_684cfc22a4a114d48131bc3a8e60928f.jpg ), 
  meme aside , is n't that somewhat logical ? 
  smaller countries do not have to invest as much in infrastructure as bigger ones do . 
  norway also has extremely shitty roads despite being ridiculously wealthy due to the many distant and rural areas , same goes for russia , merely with more corruption and bears . 
  too bad geography has nothing to do with it , otherwise mexico would be the successor to the aztec empire and us + canada the extension of native american tribes . 
  rome might have spawned on the italian peninsula , however modern day italy is no more the legitimate successor of the roman empire than spain , greece , or even france . 
  on top of that , i 'm somewhat fed up with all these incredibly ( not ) witty comments regarding reparations , at least consider which states are in question , regardless of greece 's hollow claims . 
  modern day germany existed 70 years ago in pretty much it 's identical form , greece under alexander was far from the greece that gained independence from the ottoman empire in 1832 , germany is not the hre , or similar preposterous claims like the ottoman empire = turkey . 
  better definitely , however still severely lacking when you draw a parallel to the neighbouring austrian and especially swiss regions . 
  if i go an hour north and get to innsbruck for a job it 's like a whole new world . 
  of course it 's not all bad , the labour market for example is not nearly as much affected as regions from rome southwards and our infrastructure is on average very solid but it 'd be a lie to say it 's amazing , or very good compared to other eu countries . 
   and i 'm not denying socialist ideas can help the people . 
  healthcare , workers ' rights and all that jazz . 
  i 'm saying that installing socialism/communism as state 's ideology makes the country poor . 
  there is some truth in that notion as marx himself acknowledged the purpose of capitalism as necessary state of transition until manual labour can be automated and free man-kind from the repetitive activity in order to make use of it 's creative potential to the fullest extent .
