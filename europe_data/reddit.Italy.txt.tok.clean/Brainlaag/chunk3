  however if one thing reverberates into the present , in this case a global disproportion of wealth and power accumulated by centuries of exploitation , you have a duty to fix that . 
  well , of course you have no obligation at all but i like to think we are all born with an ethics compass we can tune accordingly . 
   the modern world was created in the east and the west . 
  the islamic golden age saw a brief period in which arabs made moderate advances , largely upon the backs of classical greek/roman knowledge . 
  but what about the rest of africa ? 
  your problem is that you think human beings are better than we are . 
  we 're not . 
  our recent period of peace is the exception to the rule . 
  genocide has been a frequent , regular part of human history practiced by everyone . 
  time has a direction , as such has our development . 
  we move `` forward '' , if you want to us relics of the past as excuse , by all means , do so , it serves no purpose whatsoever . 
  people used to be headhunters and collect scalps , it was normal , family-friendly activity . 
  if our intellect is good for one thing , than it is to analyse and filter out the `` good '' from the `` bad '' , the useful from the damaging , condensing it to `` human nature '' is like taking a steaming turd on that piece of metal called voyager leaving our solar system and all similar achievements . 
   oh god , wahhabism is n't `` new '' in any meaningful sense of the word , it 's pure , orthodox islam . 
  just look at the way mohammad lived his life and tell me i 'm wrong . 
  he would have fit right in with isis . 
  it was born in the 19th century , in terms of ideologies that is not young , it 's literally still an infant . 
  i 'm going to ignore the last sentence , since judging by your stand of knowledge , i highly doubt that preposterous claim anyhow correlates to your factual knowledge on this matter . 
   and somehow you think this supports your position ? 
  when two are warm/tropical , two are temperate , and one is arctic ? 
  i do n't have access to the data they do , but i 'm going to trust the mental health experts on this one . 
  i see three poor out of five countries on that one too . 
   so what ? 
  are you similarly critical of mongolians for the conquest of genghis khan ? 
  or japan for its colonial history ( not to mention their astonishing brutality during the second world war ) . 
  of course , the damage inflicted upon the arab and persian world by the hand of genghis khan was certainly major contributor to the instability of the region , however events dating back more than 500 years tend to have slightly less of an impact than events with still a generation alive to tell about it . 
   european colonial powers improved the areas occupied with unprecedented roads , rail networks , schools , communications infrastructure , and hospitals . 
  i 'm not saying the treatment of native peoples was just or fair , but the west left more than blood and tears . 
  what about democracy and secularism , are these ideologies worth nothing ? 
  you are making an assumption that the `` savages '' would never had made the jump by themselves . 
  lots of sectarian violence stems from that period . 
  not saying they would be all kumbaya now , however the genocide perpetrated on the natives of the americas is not yet forgivable and the exploitation of africa , plus the development following colonialism and it 's remnants within western market ideology have certainly influenced it 's current state by a great deal . 
  another example relevant to the muslim world is wahhabism , a very recent and young form of islam born out of the same xenophobic and superior entitlement that bread nationalism in europe , openly supported and funded by the uk and recently the us in form of basically the entire arab peninsula . 
  the last one is a perfect example of the hypocrisy i 'm referring to , we talk one thing and do the opposite . 
  spread democracy , secularism and all the bollocks but support one of the most oppressive absolute monarchies with a zealot religious twist on the planet , being the breeding ground of the crushing majority of extremists . 
   you 're right , it 's wealth and hdi , so it still correlates to higher standard of living . 
  are you deliberately being dense , or what ? 
  let 's take a look at the top 5 countries : * ** greenland ** : hdi : 0.869 climate : arctic * ** lithuania ** : hdi : 0.834 climate : continental-temperate * ** south korea ** : hdi : 0.891 climate : continental-temperate * ** guyana ** : hdi : gdp : 0.638 climate : tropical * ** kazachstan ** : hdi : 0.757 climate : continental-warm  you people go on and on about world wars and centuries of warfare as if the west is somehow unique in this regard , it is n't . 
  the rest of the world has been at war just as long , if not longer . 
  the only difference is that while we were doing it with guns , tanks , poison gas , and aircraft , they were largely doing it with spears . 
  do n't lie to yourself , the only true , however europe was the only continent to be able to globally excel at it and export it to every corner of this planet , planting a flag in virtually every single nation that exists today and thus being directly related to lots of ensuring issues . 
   on the other hand , western culture gave us democracy and secular humanism . 
  what other culture can lay claim to anything like that ? 
  but you 're right , western culture really just means what utensils we use to eat noodles . 
  nice things indeed , at what cost however . 
  a primitive tribal society on tahiti has established a perfect form of collectivism , a dream any socialist would wet his pants over . 
  well , there are many things the western world has achieved and deserves praise for , it also foolishly and all too often let 's itself blind by it to alternatives and improvements . 
  hubris has been the downfall of all cultures before . 
   how old was her mother ? 
  did she have a sweatshop job ? 
  cambodia just resolved a brutal civil war . 
  do n't you think that maybe that had more to do with her fate ? 
  fair enough , a more `` stable '' country perhaps ? 
  how would sir enjoy bangladesh , or is another example more fitting ? 
   well not to argue with your colorful map , but there 's a mountain of literature linking suicide to wealth . 
  i 'd like you to stop glossing over my statements , i 'm not particular fond of repetitions . 
  being linked to something does not mean it 's it 's root cause , hence my original statement : `` wealth alone is merely a small contributor to this . 
  '' , otherwise there 'd be a constant between developing and industrialised world . 
  look at the global distribution of suicide rates : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_suicide_rate  we share a common culture and history , but you clearly do n't care . 
  the same culture that has caused the two world wars , on top of centuries of bloodshed and imperialism before that . 
  do n't think for a second we would n't be bashing our heads in if we did n't come this close to end it once and for all . 
  apart from that , `` we '' is a very loose term , lumping in together all of europe and `` the migrants '' ( whom themselves might be just as different among each other ) just polarises the issue to a more favourable formate for bait-rhetoric . 
  culture is but an artificial construct , a product of a given context . 
  whether you use a fork , or sticks should not determine your path in life and to what extent you 'll be able to exert your potential . 
   wow , you mean people who were raised in the lap of luxury are n't accustomed to third world living conditions ? 
  i 'm shocked !, 
  now now , i understand this might go over your head but no need to slip off into youtube comment sections . 
  no , that link was merely a further example of this :  after hearing a story from a woman whose mother died -- essentially of starvation -- when she was still a baby , j\u00f8rgensen breaks down crying . 
  `` her mother did not die because of illness or because she was killed , '' she says . 
  `` she starved to death because they did not have money for food . '' in reply to your `` they have basic necessities covered '' . 
  migration has been a constant since the dawn of mankind , trying to avert that is trying to stop the inevitable , to which you retort it 's not . 
  in what way is that a strawman if i may ask ? 
  the concept of fortifying europe is not only a gigantic waste of resources and manpower but also a direct contradiction to the values so many claim to uphold . 
  i merely asked you for one example of working isolationism ( and by that i also mean market isolation ) . 
  cuba perhaps , although it had loads of hardship to endure and the isolationism was rather not self-imposed . 
   wow , how very patronizing . 
  do you know why suicide rates are so much higher in developed countries ? 
  because people worried about their basic needs do n't have time for depression . 
  did you know suicide rates in cold countries are far higher than in temperate and tropical ones ? 
  you just oversimplified a huge matter to a single strawman . 
  wealth alone is merely a small contributor to this . 
  http://i.imgur.com/ntld9fd.png  no i do n't , i think they 'd be insulted that people like you want to throw away the sacrifices of their labour , our inheritance , for complete strangers . 
  like yourself ? 
  you are no less a stranger to me than the dude from liberia . 
   alright , what minimum wage would you suggest then ? 
  because these jobs already take care of basic necessities . 
  did you even bother reading the article about the working conditions in that british factory in cambodia ? 
  being considered anorexics and dying from starvation does not sound like basic necessity to me , let alone the blatant disregard for health safety . 
  in case that was n't clear to you , here is some more : http://www.ecouterre.com/reality-show-sends-fashion-bloggers-to-work-in-cambodian-sweatshop/, 
   that 's cute , but believe it or not things like domestic abuse and depression are still very real first world problems . 
  yes but elsewhere they have that too , on top of rampant criminality and crippling poverty . 
  the sole thought you are trying to equate the burdens on of an average eu citizen to developing countries just hints at your age and general mentality . 
   bullshit , the alternatives include farming , service work , and prostitution . 
  pretty much the same shit people have been doing since before the industrial revolution . 
  so everyone has to reinvent the wheel for themselves ? 
  might be a fair gamble if you reset everything to zero and start it off anew , at any rate , the world does n't work like that . 
  do n't you think our ancestors who fought and died for these rights would feel insulted by how they are being handled right now ? 
   do you honestly believe that ? 
  because that 's not what happens , when you force them to adopt western minimum wages the jobs move back to western countries because shipping makes it too expensive . 
  christ , this is n't even economics 101 , it 's common sense .
