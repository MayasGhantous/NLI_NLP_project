  i did not say western wage minimum , i said wage minimum and basic necessities in the country of origin . 
  a well paid worker in bangladesh is still less expensive than a cheap machine in europe . 
  one salary here , is a whole factory there . 
   that 's very idealistic but it is n't going to happen and i 'm not sure it should . 
  i believe in helping people to the extent that it does n't impact my own standard of living , but all cultures/countries are not equal and my own comes first . 
  ah yes , the typical helping when one can be arsed to . 
  `` never look down on anybody unless you 're helping them up '' is all i can say . 
  the moment you have more than somebody else and are unwilling to share , you disrupt balance and destroy harmony , you become part of the problem . 
  is the same mindset the rich have employed to control the planet , when you cry out about high taxes etc. 
  you just look after yourself , not at poor people within your own country hit far harder by it , when a corporate magnate bitches about taxes he does it from his pov , not of the country , or other businesses . 
  it 's the very same , selfishness . 
   everyone , no matter how privileged has a right to complain . 
  just because i was n't born into poverty does n't make my problems any less real , they 're just different . 
  indeed , however i 'd wager fighting for survival is slliiiiiiightly more serious than being unable to buy a new phone . 
   you 're damn right i support sweatshops , because they 're a good thing for local third world economies . 
  let me be very clear , we are not talking about slave labor , these are prized jobs that people fight to get . 
  yes , because the alternative is death , that is no choice but forced slavery . 
  sure they earn a little bit more at the cost of their health and future , however this remains probably the worst excuse i have ever seen regarding this matter - guess why their wages are so low ? 
  because the businesses profiting from their sales abroad in consumerist societies make maximum profit . 
  by curtailing on their profits ( boycotts and the like ) we force them to assure minimum wage standards and workplace safety for people abroad . 
  this will make products slightly more expensive but will give them a bigger incentive to stay in their country , while also assuring at least basic necessities . 
   i do n't agree with colonial taxes , but i do n't have a problem with farm subsidies . 
  western governments ' primary concern should be the well-being of their own people . 
  if that means protecting the interests of domestic farmers through subsidies at the expense of someone on another continent , then i say damn good . 
  by all means , do what you think is right , it merely boils down to an `` us vs them '' mentality , whereas we should start thinking as a global community in the shared and fragile environment we have . 
  as you can see , long term repercussions and damages do not remain localised but tend to spread . 
  so the famines worsened , the agricultural sectors crippled and the people deprived of their livelihood ( let alone the death and suffering caused by it ) by the subsidies are directly linked to the migrants so many consider a nuisance now . 
  `` why do n't they stay in their own countries '' should be a fairly familiar phrase ... well , there 's your answer . 
  yes look at me , i 'm the bogyman and at night i 'll come into your homes and rape your children . 
  better watch out . 
  care elaborate after spouting some of your fearmongering too ? 
   life is n't fair , there are billions of people in miserable circumstances who would jump at a shot at life in a developed country . 
  it is n't feasible to let them all in . 
  at some point you have to say `` context does n't matter . '', 
  let me turn this around for a moment : you have been born with the silver spoon up your ass , you have no right to complain , ever again . 
  you belong into the higher segments of society , as such all the shit that happens to you does not matter , because there is always worst . 
  indifference and inaction just makes the problems worst later on , it wo n't go away because it 's being ignored . 
   i 'm sick of hearing about western guilt . 
  have you ever acted on it ? 
  because if you have n't and yet bought something at a discounter your openly support sweatshops . 
   politicians from every corner of the world have been practicing machiavellian politics since before there was a word for it . 
  i 'm not talking about politicians since people seeking power belong to a very special breed of egoistic maniacs . 
  however there are hordes of people sharing a similar view point , often just out of sheer bigotry . 
   westerners ( at least in recent history ) have just been better at it . 
  the people in general , yes , however we still adhere to customs and actions that are very damaging to people abroad without being even aware of it . 
  the two examples below being two relics of the high times of european powers . 
  http://www.siliconafrica.com/france-colonial-tax/ http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/05/opinion/farm-subsidies-that-kill.html  this simply is n't true . 
  the majority of so-called `` sweatshops '' offer higher wages than any other work these people would get . 
  they develop local economies and when wages get too high they 're replaced with better work , and move to another underdeveloped country . 
  this kind of labor might seem immoral now , but 150 years ago western economies went through the same kind of development . 
  http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/cambodian-textile-workers-who-supply-uk-clothing-stores-starving-and-suffering-mass-faintings-8820468.html yes and a hundred years ago people still lynched `` niggers '' , hell , just fifty years ago they were viewed as second class citizen in the us . 
  70 years ago europe waged the bloodiest war this world had ever seen . 
  if we adhere to human rights and these values of `` western enlightenment '' , we have to practice them accordingly . 
  we have the technology and resources to phase out such inhuman labour , merely profit stands in the way . 
  this i consider a direct insult to the human intellect . 
   except not having one 's society overrun by the impoverished and aid-seeking of another society whose culture ( and language , and religion ) is often quite different ( and which left to its own devices , has not produced the same bounty as one 's own ) is n't an inevitability . 
  really ? 
  give me one example when isolationism has worked for a country ? 
   it 's a matter of what laws you 're willing to have and what geographic susceptibility you have . 
  maine does n't have a lot of illegal immigrants from spanish speaking countries . 
  texas does . 
  that 's simply not a coincidence ; it 's geography . 
  canada does n't have a lot of immigration of poor people ; the us does - - that 's not a coincidence , it 's the intersection of geography and rule of law that produces those different results . 
  your point being ? 
  the structure with which the eu handles migrants is quite damaging to the entire process itself . 
  basically migrants will receive asylum in the country they are first registered in and will not be able to go any further until they receive residency , permission papers , work permit , etc , which takes years . 
  this causes many people in the border states ( italy , spain , etc. ), 
  to avoid detection and remain clandestine until they reach their target countries ( germany , uk , netherlands and scandinavia being prime targets ) . 
  by remaining illegals they automatically exert themselves from the market and are forced to either work illegally , or be beggars , thus causing the problems in the first place . 
  you might ask yourself why do n't they apply for asylum in italy ? 
  well , only complete and utter fools wish to remain in italy and this comes from an italian , being in a financially troubled country full of angry and rather homogeneous people is no life anyone dreams of but many are stranded here and forced to live it . 
  unable to move forward , or go back . 
   if you 're so concerned about their human rights being violated , and you believe it 's `` inevitable '' immigrants from less developed , less safe , less economically productive countries should go to those places where the living situation is better , i hope you 've made up a spare bedroom and are preparing to buy some more plates and dishes and silverware for your new roommates . 
  why are those countries less safe , less economically productive and in general less preferable to live in ? 
  this might help you formulate the answer : [ book 1 ] ( https://books.google.it/books?id=vdkuwa_me7ac&amp;pg=pa67&amp;lpg=pa67&amp;dq=africa%27s+importance+to+france&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=azyaepdr6x&amp;sig=vtuvu9f62ljqvcs7d2o_uf-bypm&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=dgvkvk7_ejlgam-igsgf&amp;ved=0cfeq6aewca#v=onepage&amp;q=africa's%20importance%20to%20france&amp;f=false ) [ book 2 ] ( https://books.google.it/books?id=zvlzpwjhgqgc&amp;pg=pa246&amp;lpg=pa246&amp;dq=africa%27s+importance+to+france&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kg-as12tkw&amp;sig=4vvyfcyttgvwrlzjn-taannwo7k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=dgvkvk7_ejlgam-igsgf&amp;ved=0cdwq6aewba#v=onepage&amp;q=africa's%20importance%20to%20france&amp;f=false ) http://www.siliconafrica.com/france-colonial-tax/ http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/05/opinion/farm-subsidies-that-kill.html  you will , of course , be dedicating your own resources to these people , right ? 
  i have and do on a daily basis . 
   because you 're so high up on that horse of yours ? 
  yes , i 'm so high up on my horse that except for the lacking food products i can not cultivate myself and taxes , just about my entire income goes to organisations trying to solve this issue . 
  not only that , i have 3 migrants sleeping on my couch and many more to come . 
  i do not preach what i do n't practice , the world is full of hypocrites already , no need to add some more to it . 
  however thank you for jumping to ad hominem as conclusive sentence , what discussion would it be if you were not to target the speaker , instead of the text . 
  you are making sweepping generalisations . 
  i interact and work with migrants on a daily basis , you 'd be surprised how many of them have a degree , even upper qualifications and yet are treated worst than dirty . 
  there are quite a few unskilled workers among them , or children , yes , however the context of their migration is often ignored . 
  people like to bitch so much about them , yet forget what the circumstances of their undertaking were . 
  we like to point fingers at others , yet absolve ourselves from any guilt , we ignore the events that have lead to the richest country in africa ( libya ) to collapse and become a failed state , we ignore the events that have crippled african economy for decades under western market dominion , we ignore the mess that is the me and how it came to be , we ignore how many of our cheap goods we define as a given and often praise as the wealth others envy so much are crafted under inhumane conditions by people working their asses off and yet starving ( to death ) . 
  i 'm not saying give away all you have but since we own most of the wealth , we carry a responsibility to share it with the less lucky , even more so when a big chunk of it is built upon the suffering of those , who you now condemn . 
  instead of wasting time and resources trying to delay the inevitable , under breach of human rights ? 
  absolutely . 
  committing resources to the core issue of migration is better than any fence , or army guarding it , however that would require cooperation and insight on this matter and not dull slogans one can spout on rallies . 
  i 'm not trying to water down a very complex issue , tearing down every and any border at the moment would have a counter-productive effect even . 
  nonetheless it is the goal in the long run and as such we 'll have to work towards it , one way , or another . 
  better start sooner than later . 
  * human rights , merely matter to us when it 's either within our interests , or us ourselves enduring hardship . 
  * national law with plenty of loopholes and willfully overlooked , or even by the state enabled shaddy activity . 
  * market and labour exploitation , yet remaining hypocritical when others try to pursue happiness , or just fairness . 
  * selective `` freedom of speech '' etc. [ ... ], 
  [ illegal push-backs ] ( http://www.ecre.org/component/content/article/70-weekly-bulletin-articles/500-spain-illegally-pushing-back-migrants-to-morocco.html ) included , all border countries , especially bulgaria , greece and spain , are violating human rights in their unreachable quest for fortifying europe . 
  playing by a delay tactic , funneling away funding and using the pressing issues merely as jump-board for elections and other internal political affairs . 
  it sickens me to what degree the western world attains hypocrisy in the wake of global communication and how little is openly presented , even known in the first place .
