  meanwhile populist movements ( and other radical ones ) keep receiving plenty of support in the face of utter inability to push forward other strikingly xenophobic and shortsighted approaches . 
  nope , it 's more towards the contrary but see for yourself : http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/noncommunicable-diseases/mental-health/data-and-statistics http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/atlas/profiles/en/ germany :  in germany , neuropsychiatric disorders are estimated to contribute to 30.9 % of the global burden of disease italy :  in italy , neuropsychiatric disorders are estimated to contribute to 27.9 % of the global burden of disease the statistics about suicide rates and their frequency/occurrence compared to mental-health disorders ( when disregarding financial troubles ) are pretty much identical . 
   a 21st-century conspiracy theory regards the frankfurt school as the origin of a contemporary movement in the political left to subvert traditional western cultural norms , referred to as `` cultural marxism '' by theory proponents . 
  it advocates the idea that multiculturalism and political correctness are products of critical theory , which originated with the frankfurt school . 
  the theory is associated with american conservative thinkers such as william lind , pat buchanan and paul weyrich , and has received institutional support from the free congress foundation [ ... ]  [ ... ] according to chip berlet , who specializes in the study of extreme right-wing movements , the cultural marxism conspiracy theory found fertile ground with the development of the tea party movement in 2009 , with contributions published in the american thinker and worldnetdaily highlighted by some tea party websites [ ... ]  [ ... ] philosopher and political science lecturer j\u00e9r\u00f4me jamin has stated `` next to the global dimension of the cultural marxism conspiracy theory , there is its innovative and original dimension , which lets its authors avoid racist discourses and pretend to be defenders of democracy .

  i fully back / u/hjongoldrake . 
  i 'd vote for / u/jebusgobson too , however i 've seen him being too emotional and thus `` kneejerky '' in his comments for the position of a moderator . 
  edit : i confused / u/zurfer75 with somebody else , he gets my vote as well . 
  the bell of heresy rings indisputably clear . 
  do n't be , bertolli is shite when you taste the good brands . 
  also spanish ones , mmmhhhmmm . 
  irrelevant to the dataset and scenario raised by me , since both cases boil down to dutch citizenship = more productivity . 
  uhm , no it does n't , since it omits foreigners who have acquired citizenship and are thus also most likely the more productive members of society . 
  the way it 's being presented there is a higher scrutiny on non-naturalised people . 
  so it does n't bother you in the least bit that the title is patently false ? 
  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... no , i 'm saying this : you and i conclude it comes down to socio-economic conditions when we hear `` proportionally most of the prison inmates in the us are blacks '' , however , somebody not aware of that , somebody with an agenda to promote other things , or simple bigots with racist tendencies do not . 
   the incarceration rate really does n't . 
  difficult surroundings lead black people to more crime . 
  there are many reasons under that , but that 's the umbrella . 
  as said , depending on the audience the conclusion you and i draw from it is not the same . 
  as such it can not be presented in that formate , because it leaves room for error , room for interpretation . 
  no fact should allow that when using it as argument . 
  you gave a link to incarceration rates , not the probability of people getting attacked at some point in their life in direct relation to their possible interaction with people of colour . 
  it 's the same thing with the statistic about shitting and dying i gave earlier . 
  make the statement broad enough and you are bound to score a positive , does n't take away from the fact that the prison statement is also vague , perhaps not as much , yet sufficiently as i already proved . 
  i 'm aware of that , there is plenty of illegal working in spain and italy too . 
  no one in the right mind would think something between a fifth to half of the population is n't contributing to the state and perhaps even collecting benefits on top of that . 
  but yours is n't a fact , merely some example you just pulled out of your nose , of course it 's not comparable when is n't true . 
  and you are missing the point of this entire exchange . 
  why did i even bring up that example in the first place ? 
  hint : it was n't because i intended to address the american prison and race culture . 
   more black people are in jail , yes and none of that has to do with their specific ethnicity on a biological scale . 
  the are incarcerated because historical occurrences have put them on average into a lower income bracket , whereas nowadays discrimination not only persists within law enforcement ( racial profiling , crack down on low-income neighbourhoods , etc. ), 
  but also in the job market too ( proportionally get less wage for the same jobs ) , which puts additional stress on minorities and thus results in higher incarceration rates . 
  was it clear enough now ? 
  * socio-economic conditions * . 
  or do you wish to circlejerk further and tiptoe around the obvious ? 
  indeed they sound a lot more reasonable , i just wonder what figures have been fudged and to what degree `` under the table '' work is being counted towards it , as it does not offer the labour-benefits of official employment . 
  how come there is so much conflicting data compared to [ this ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/bosnia-and-herzegovina/unemployment-rate ) and the examinations of the world bank ? 
  just under 50 %, 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statistics_of_incarcerated_african-american_males[1] _______________________________________________________________________  present it to a group of racists and they 'll extrapolate it 's because non-whites are inherently more violent/engaged in crimes . 
   and although some correlation with ethnicities exists , there is no ** biological evidence ** which supports ** this ** claim . 
  there is biological evidence non-white minorities are more violent/prone to crime ? 
  you just summarised what i was getting at . 
  if i present the claim `` most inmates in the us are people of colour '' without further context , despite the fact numbers itself are neutral , the outcome of it would be determined by the interpretation of the respective audience . 
  * present it to a group of racists and they 'll extrapolate it 's because non-whites are inherently more violent/engaged in crimes . 
  * present it to a group of minorities and they 'll extrapolate they are being discriminated against . 
  you see , it 's a fact , it 's plain numbers , yet the results are deceiving . 
  we call that confirmation bias . 
  laying out a solid foundation , which then gets backed up by numbers can be presented as untainted facts ; as follows in the example : --  socio-economic circumstances determine the rate of inmates and although some correlation with ethnicities exists , there is no biological evidence which supports this claim . 
  it is more likely that certain ethnicities are either due to historic , or current societal circumstances being pushed into said bracket . 
  failure to do so makes basically any data-set invalid , otherwise `` objective '' analysis would be impossible . 
   your statistic is n't comparable . 
  there 's very little room for insinuation in saying most people in jail are black . 
  it just means they grow up in harsh surroundings , and are more likely to commit crimes . 
  very little in what universe ? 
  omitting socio-economic circumstances means disregarding the very causation of certain figures . 
  as such simply tossing out the aforementioned is not only disingenuous to an analytic approach but also blissfully biased and an insult to the scientific method in general . 
  you are missing the point , the presentation determines whether a fact has value , or not . 
  a 100 % of people who take a shit die . 
  without further clarification that claim is correct , yet absolutely worthless and can only serve to push an agenda . 
  for in-depth explanation : http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/, 
  most inmates in the us are people of colour . 
  most poor people on the planet are non-white . 
  none of that is factually wrong . 
  not the facts , their presentation , as / u/xeran _ explained in his clarification of the current data . 
  bitches about muslims --  top posts about `` christian continent '' . 
  i do n't fucking even . 
  how about you keep your forsaken superstitions to yourself , ey ? 
  i 'm totally fine with you having imaginary friends but holy fuck , the damage religions in form of institutions have brought to societies , modern societies is enormous . 
  polish people seems to go nuts for completely characterless rooms . 
  do n't get me wrong , it 's tidy and clean but there is ... nothing . 
  i fully agree there , how people can enjoy such lifeless , sterile rooms is beyond me . 
  then again i paint all sorts of things on the walls and add dozens of pieces as soon as i move in somewhere , so perhaps i 'm weird . 
  what 's up with the terrorism and france ? 
  also respect to the guys that took care of him . 
  what would expect from a guy that , as / u/stoni988 correctly said , looks like he walked off straight from a bond film set . 
  thanks !, 
  keep it classy italy ^ for ^ ^ fuck 's ^ ^ ^ sake ... and even fox news, 
   that 's very interesting . 
  yes , if you do n't mind , please go into detail , i 'm sure i 'm not the only one interested in the stories . 
  right , i have two particular stories that stuck with me . 
  the first was a syrian family ( or what was left of it , really ) , father , two daughters and his sister . 
  they fled initially to turkey and ended up in the huge camps they have along the border there . 
  they spent a few months there despite constant harassment by turkish policemen and even some disgruntled locals alike . 
  it was n't until his younger daughter was almost raped by two workers of the camp that they decide it was not a safe place to stay . 
  they moved west and while the locals started to become less hostile , the abuses still persisted . 
  as such he took the decision to take one of the boats ( yes , they are aware of the dangers , people refer to them even as the `` death boats '' ) to greece . 
  it took them 7 months to gather the money , his sister sold her body ( a nurse keep in mind ) , he worked dangerous and ungrateful jobs despite his career as high school teacher ( like dislodging pieces of stuck heavy equipment in the steelworks ) . 
  they ended up selling/trading the little they had saved and then embarked with nothing but their cloths on . 
  migrants used to tell any newcomers to pack all valuable papers in ziplock bags , or similar in the case they suffered a shipwreck , however there were also rumours about turkish border authorities taking away their documents , as such he decided to hide them in his belt . 
  they landed on lesbos and spent some time there . 
  i ca n't recall how exactly his sister earned a little additional money , she did find a temporary assignment as nurse due to the influx of migrants and lack of experienced personnel , yet i do n't remember if it was under the table , or via local authorities . 
  at any rate , they reached main land greece and made their way through the balkans ( through fryom , serbia , croatia , slovenia and ultimately italy ) . 
  they did so because greece was in completely disarray ( remember all the violent protests ? ), 
  and the scars of the war through out the yugo countries were vividly visible in the urban centres and minds of people alike , hence they moved on in spite of no perceived hostility towards them . 
  they reached italy last year , applied for asylum and luckily had been processed rather fast . 
  from what i know nizar ( the father ) is attending a post-lauream program atm to learn italian and hopefully receive a permanent residency and work-permit . 
  the second was a young eritrean , early 20s , he had professional experience in wood working and wished to escape the traumatic past of the ethiopian-eritrean independence war that saw the use of child soldiers and mass brutalisation on an unfathomable scale .
