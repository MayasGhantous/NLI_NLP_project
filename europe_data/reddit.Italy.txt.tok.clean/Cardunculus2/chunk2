  ultimately , as i see it , a `` good deal '' is one that it is as economically beneficial as possible for the eu . 
  i think that having the uk as a prosperous , friendly partner would be ultimately beneficial ; having it as a poor , disgruntled neighbour , not so much . 
  we have enough enemies already , no need making more . 
  i do n't think that what you say is a danger . 
  the very best deal that we can offer the uk , i think , would be something along the lines of the one we have with norway , which * is * beneficial to both partners ; but that deal is nowhere as good as the one that the uk used to have as a member of the eu . 
  norway has to pay contributions to the eu , to follow its regulations about some specific sectors ( * without * being able to vote on them ) , and has to allow freedom of movement . 
  in exchange , it gets access to the single market and free movement of goods and people . 
  objectively , this is quite a good deal for norway as well as for the eu . 
  but compared to what the uk used to have , it 's * nothing * . 
  so no , i do n't worry about `` fostering anti-eu sentiment '' by not going out of our way to damage british economy . 
  if anything , i think that doing that would foster it , and rightly so as we would have revealed ourselves vindictive and tyrannical ; and in fact , it is one of the few things that might make me reconsider my current rabidly pro-eu position . 
  ruining people 's livelihoods ( because this is what we are talking about ) as an act of punishment would not sit well at all with me . 
  agreed . 
  if there are good chances that taking one more year will result in a good deal , i think that we will go for it ; if instead it will seem that the uk is just wasting our time , we 'll live with not having a trade agreement with the uk ( and if they want to , they can always negotiate one later on ) . 
  this climate of uncertainty about the future relationship between the eu and the uk is not good for anyone . 
  the sooner it is dispelled , the better . 
  on the other hand , a good deal with the uk would be very much in the interests of the whole eu . 
  if the deal fails only because of a spanish point of pride about the ownership of gibraltar , the other countries will be * peeved * . 
  i guess it will depend on how the rest of the negotiations will have gone until then . 
  italian here , would you like us to ally with you and then switch sides when you start to lose ? 
  we could even declare war on france after you have already defeated it , just to say that we won too - it 'll be like old times !, 
  ( no more invading russia though plz ), 
  that 's a very good point , i did not think of that possibility . 
  perhaps such an ultimatum would affect the opinions of the other eu countries towards spain too badly for it to be considered ; but at the very least , spain might insist on guarantees that gibraltar will stop being a tax haven and damaging spanish economy . 
  * unless * it is unanimously decided to offer an extension . 
  which i 'd bet it will have to be the case , two years would have been a very short time to hammer out all the details even if the uk had not wasted so many months in aimless posturing . 
  ultimately , a deal is in the interests of everyone involved . 
  if progress is being made ( that is , if things go differently from how they have been going thus far ) , i would not be against offering one further year of time to make sure that everyone involved ends up as happy about the agreement as possible . 
  it was not a coup . 
  they just meant to have a surprise blimp parade in honor of erdogan , and there was a tragic misunderstanding . 
  well , an `` everyone but the conservative '' alliance would work ; and having sinn f\u00e9in , dup , liberal democrats , snp and labour all work together would be interesting . 
  as in `` the moon just put on a huge chef hat and ate the sun '' interesting . 
  are there any chances for a grand coalition between labour and conservatives , with a platform of `` let 's just take care of ordinary stuff and work on brexit negotiation , and let 's all agree to hold new elections in a couple of years '' ? 
  the [ wording of the treaty ] ( http://europa.eu/european-union/sites/europaeu/files/eu_citizenship/consolidated-treaties_en.pdf ) says that  the treaties shall cease to apply to the state in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or , failing that , two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2 , unless the european council , in agreement with the member state concerned , unanimously decides to extend this period with no provision for the member state to unilaterally stop this from happening ; and the [ european parliament 's position ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_50_of_the_treaty_on_european_union#re-entry_or_unilateral_revocation ) is that it is not reversible unless the other members agree . 
  if there was a dispute about the interpretation , i think that it would be up to the [ european court of justice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_court_of_justice ) to give the ruling ; and ... well , everything could happen , but i do n't see that as very likely . 
  so whatever uk government chose to unilaterally `` go back '' would have to face not only significant internal opposition ( 50 % + of uk citizens do not want in , after all ) , but also the likelihood of not being allowed to at all ; and furthermore , if by some miracle it managed to remain against the opposition of the other eu members those would become , let us say , not very favourably disposed towards the interests of the uk to begin with . 
  in these circumstances , i think it would be more in the interests of the uk to seek some sort of external treaty with the eu : either something along the one between norway and the eu , or a more limited one if they are dead set on not having free movement of people ( but this will also mean that it will be more limited on other aspects too ) . 
  still 7 seats to call , i think . 
  if the tories can win at least 3 , which seems likely , that might be doable - unstable as hell , but doable . 
  not sure if sarcasm ? 
  no , i 'm pretty sure that the eu would * not * welcome a return to the pre-brexit status quo , with the danger ( or , i should say , the certainty ) that as soon as things get difficult the uk will trigger the exit once more , further destabilizing our project ( and , most likely , whining incessantly about the tyranny of eu regulations in the meantime , never mind that they asked to join , contributed as much to their formation as anyone else , and had been given uniquely favourable conditions to boot ) . 
  the uk was a valued member of the eu project ; but it has proven itself unreliable as a member , so i 'd rather just have it as a reliable ally if possible . 
  if , as it is the case now , the primary allegiance of the members of the european parliament is to their own home states , i am not sure that this is workable . 
  just to mention * one random and most certainly unrealistic example * , let us say that turkey starts making noise about how cyprus should be all turkish , and let us say that the republic of cyprus requests a greater presence of eu military in order to discourage turkey from doing something silly . 
  turkey , on the other hand , warns the eu that if the eu does such an * unprovoked and unlawful act of aggression * as sending troops to cyprus , it will retaliate by opening its borders and sending a ton of migrants towards , let us say , its borders with bulgaria . 
  how will bulgarian members of the european parliament vote ? 
  how will ... 
  i dunno , the finnish members of the european parliament ? 
  you are not wrong , i speak from experience  i do not think that we are as bad as we once were , actually . 
  but my point is , fighting vulgarity with vulgarity just lowers the level of the discussion , which actually ends up * helping * one 's opponents . 
  those of us who made fun of brunetta ( one of berlusconi 's main followers , and a. . . contentious ... character to say the least ) by calling him a `` dwarf '' , for instance , made the italian left no favours at all . 
  i 'm afraid that , no matter the time , using sexually charged insults towards female politicians is nothing but pointless vulgarity . 
  i do n't give a damn about how may is in bed , and i have no reason to think that she had sexual relations with trump . 
  this sort of talk will certainly not convince may 's supporters to switch sides , does not constitute a valid criticism of her policies , and contributes to normalize the type of bluster and name-calling-based politics in which individuals such as trump thrive . 
  like the euro itself ( but even more so , i think ) this is potentially an excellent idea , but unless we commit to a greater degree of * political * unity it will never work properly . 
  it 's all well and good to say let 's have an eu military ; but who gets to make decisions for it - buying equipment , nominating generals and so on , deploying it , the whole shebang ? 
  if the people who will have to make these decisions will receive their mandates from single eu countries , or anyway will be more committed to the interests of their individual countries than to those of the eu as a whole , this will be a useless shitshow and nothing else . 
  if we want to have a single eu army , i think that we also need to commit to full eu federalism ( of which , personally , i am an enthusiastic supporter ) . 
  nothing else would really suffice , i think . 
  please , * please * , ** please ** do not fuck up . 
  macron will likely have an excellent opportunity ; but if he squanders it , he could damage the eu project irreparably . 
  my point is that nowhere in the nato agreement it is stated that countries that have not met the agreement yet have to pay . 
  asking for us to increase our military spending to 2 % is reasonable , and in fact we agreed . 
  asking for payment now has no basis , and would be met with `` ha , no '' under the best of circumstances . 
  these are not the best of circumstances . 
  considering the absurd amount of harm that ** your ** military ( which is well above 2 % of your gdp , * well done * , have a cookie - heck , have two ) has done to the equilibrium of our region , do you see why such a request would be considered insulting ? 
  formally , we do not owe money to you or vice versa ; and morally , the idea that * we * owe anything to you would be laughable if it was not infuriating . 
  the purpose of nato is to protect member states from outside threats ; the us military 's recent actions have mostly been an excellent * generator * of outside threats . 
  and let us be clear also on one thing : if article 5 fails , the whole nato alliance - which , so far , serves first and foremost us interests - has no purpose . 
  among other things , this means no nato bases in our countries . 
  i suggest that you consider * with attention * if this is your interest . 
  so : we agreed on the 2 % policy , from 2024 onwards . 
  but your country 's attempt to `` put pressure '' on us by inventing imaginary penalties no one signed on are not only nonsensical , but straight out insulting . 
   we 're talking money because the language in the treaty is n't and has n't been followed . 
  the * language of the treaty * did not mention the payment of penalties of that kind . 
  asking them * now * , when the other members have actually agreed to raise the spending to 2 % by 2024 , is entirely nonsensical . 
  the reason why my counter is relevant is that trump would have us pay for the fact that the us invested more in their army than we did . 
  what the us recently did with that army is quite relevant to the topic , i think . 
  the fact that the us used its army to culpably bring about a major , enduring disaster - one in a region that is closer to europe than to it - and that , if anything , it should pay for it is not at all `` irrelevant whataboutism '' . 
  it 's as if we all agreed to set up a neighbourhood watch , and one of us ended up spending far more nights walking around and looking for possible trouble than the others . 
  however , instead of keeping the peace , this individual ended up picking unnecessary fights with some seedy guy who once quarrelled with his father , thrashing the whole neighbourhood in the process for no reason other than his `` tough-guy '' delusions . 
  then , after that , this person had the gall of telling the others that we should pay him for the fact that he spends more time in the neighbourhood watch , despite the fact that 1 . 
  no one had ever agreed to pay anything ; 2 . 
  this person 's recent actions as part of the neighbourhood watch caused an absurd amount of damage for no good reason . 
   this is no major difference to an envisioned european defence union the difference is that the envisioned european defence union does not exist yet , and even in the best case scenario it will take * quite some time * before it is as effective as required ( no need to make it as huge as the u.s. army , that would be pointless overkill ; but it would have to be able to provide a serious deterrent to would-be attackers ) . 
  i tend to be wildly optimistic in my predictions , so i 'll say that * perhaps * 15 years from now i might agree with you if everything goes as well as it can ( although at that point an argument could be made for us to remain part of nato and transform it into something less us-centric - i would actually prefer this , if possible ) . 
  but these things take time , and we can not remain defenseless until we get the european defence working properly ( which will be ** far ** from trivial ) . 
   the invasion of iraq was unilaterally decided by the u.s. and has no bearing on nato in this context . 
  ~ ~ the u.s. initially asked nato to assist the iraq invasion ; but the request was not approved . 
  look [ here ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/cn/natohq/topics_51977.htm ) in the `` the evolution of nato 's involvement '' for details . ~ ~ ** edit : ** this part was incorrect , i misremembered and misread the source . 
  you are right , the iraq invasion has nothing to do with the topic . 
  again , i do n't disagree that u.s. dominance in nato is less than ideal ; but i do not think that it is total , and i think that for the moment being nato membership is still more useful than harmful . 
   europe has finally reached the point where nato has outlived its purpose and usefulness i disagree . 
  perhaps we will eventually get there ; but at the moment , we are not there at all . 
  nato , as a defensive organization , is still very necessary , especially for eastern europe ; and while , yes , u.s. dominance in it is less than welcome , it is not true that `` america decides how , when and where large scale operations are undertaken '' . 
  during the 2003 invasion of iraq , for instance , many nato members did not support at all the u.s. operations , and turkey for instance did not allow the us to deploy forces on its territory . 
  the 2 % was never a payment ** to ** nato to begin with . 
  it is the percentage of gdp that nato countries should eventually invest in * their own * militaries , which of course have to defend other nato members if necessary . 
  if we get an eu army , i think that it would be part of nato too , which means that we would have to defend other nato countries if they are attacked ( i do n't love that a dictatorship like turkey is protected by us ; but then again , attacking turkey would be an awful idea regardless ) and that it would count towards the 2 % requirement . 
  not disagreeing , just expanding on this ,
