man , i 'd let you see the condition of some roads in my town ... if only street view would n't become like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/vteoscq.jpg ) when going on those i need to show you . 
  and let 's not talk about [ naples ' outskirts ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zwrbewc.jpg ) ... edit : just to clarify , that is the first road i took form google maps randomly . 
  i know there are fare worse than that . 
  problem is , almost every road is like that . 
  `` the criteria for the job are these . '', 
  i doubt it would be as useful . 
  puglia is a region . 
  that may be why you have never heard of it before . 
  it is just wonderful in the south east part like `` santa maria di leuca '', 
  i enjoyed seeing the journey of an american in europe for his first time . 
  the difference between the two is mindblowing , i imagine how you could have been stunned , and if you are impressed about things older than 200 years , you should consider visiting italy next time ( for history and architecture : rome or almost every other city ; for sea : puglia ) . 
  you also made great photos !, 
  i really like them  but i found a chunk [ of love locks ] that had broke off , so i bought a new lock and reattached it . 
  do n't do that !, 
  i hate those things , they can be hazardous . 
  in france a piece of the railing collapsed under the weight of the locks , they add 300 kg per meter . 
  guys , what the fuck is going on with macedonia ? 
  now it is a ghost town . 
  i used the incorrect words ... though it was what i meant . 
  actually : yes . 
  really ? 
  naples is one of the most populated zones in europe ? 
  in fact :  against the blue sky of the western world , the stars represent the peoples of europe in a circle , a symbol of unity . 
  their number shall be invariably set at twelve , the symbol of completeness and perfection ... just like the twelve signs of the zodiac represent the whole universe , the twelve gold stars stand for all peoples of europe -- including those who can not as yet take part in building up europe in unity and peace . 
  pfft . 
  1 and 2 are normal to see in the whole country . 
  however 4 is quite impressive !, 
  edit : found out that even mayors from central italy do [ it ] ( http://www.ufficiodisabili.it/imgnews/3bauto.jpg ) . 
  and [ this dick ] ( http://paoblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/bolzano_corsoliberta-vialongon-3.jpg ) in bolzano , and [ this one ] ( http://2.citynews-lecceprima.stgy.it/~media/originale/51342373433771/la-situazione-traffic-questa-mattina-a-lecce-rispetto-forzato-delle-strisce-gialle-da-parte-degli-automobilisti-ma-c-e-chi-usa-le-piste-ciclabili.jpg ) in lecce ... and [ this one ] ( http://www.ilsitodipalermo.it/sites/default/files/imagecache/immagine_middle/immagini_articoli/20140801_093548.jpg ) in palermo ... and [ these guys ] ( http://gazzettadimodena.gelocal.it/modena/cronaca/2014/07/29/news/automobilisti-graziati-non-deve-piu-accadere-1.9675962 ) in modena ... yeah , maybe bari is n't the problem . 
  yeah , though people make fun of it also because drivers [ park ] ( http://bari.repubblica.it/images/2014/03/04/103513648-ceec8545-ffe7-4dc6-9367-db0bc72f2176.jpg ) [ everywhere ] ( http://www.notizie.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/20120702-095042.jpg ) . 
  edit : forgot to add [ this ] ( http://bari.repubblica.it/images/2013/07/20/145202887-b2cb245d-9b91-463c-8c0c-f01f06878034.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://bari.repubblica.it/images/2013/07/20/145202887-b2cb245d-9b91-463c-8c0c-f01f06878034.jpg ), 
  nope . 
  although la repubblica did help spread some hoaxes , it is generally the most credible newspaper here . 
  if you call bull , you should link some evidence . 
  everyone who did n't vote for berlusconi says that italians are stupid ... and that opinion strengthens if you see another country ( for me , it was england ) . 
  italy is the least trustworthy according to italy . 
  i ca n't agree more, 
  i find my lack of traveling disturbing : c http://i.imgur.com/twvy0cz.png, 
  well , the trevi fountain is wonderful , but it would be too obvious , as the colosseum and st. peter would be ( though the last one is n't in italy ) . 
  i do n't like castel sant ` angelo much , it is not really beautiful to see in my opinion . 
  i could have put the pantheon , or villa farnesina instead . 
  okay , i 'll edit it . 
  what do they like it for ? 
  feel free to add your own . 
  it was my personal view , i liked it , and i made this in little time , so i could n't think so much ... 
  sorry if i offended you by choosing it, 
  well , i like it mostly because represents the creation of a united italy , that 's why i decided to put it here . 
  ** italy ** i want to say that i am not putting this in any particular order . 
  ** 1 ** [ basilica di santa maria del fiore ] ( http://teatriemusei.ovest.com/_img_key/527-prodotto_grande-cattedrale-santa-maria-del-fiore.jpg ) , 160 meters long and 91 meters high at the wonderful [ cupola ] ( http://www.foliamagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/la-cupola-di-santa-maria-del-fiore-1024x657.jpg ) . 
  a [ photo ] ( http://www.architetti.san.beniculturali.it/image/image_gallery?uuid=bd93df55-8c4b-47ef-895e-5a44e41b4c58&amp;groupid=10304&amp;t=1339080687778 ) of the facade and i just love the [ floor ] ( http://www.foto-blog.it/img/pavimenti-duomo-firenze_eos-30d_48289.jpg ) ** 2 ** staying in florence , we have [ palazzo vecchio ] ( http://gaiaspia.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/palazzo-vecchio.jpg ) ( bet ya climbed that on assassin 's creed ii , too ) , that was home of the priory of florence , of the short lived parliament of the republic of savonarola and from 1865 to 1871 of the italian parliament . 
  it has the beautiful [ salone dei cinquecento ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/firenze-palazzo_vecchio_24.jpg ) and a lot of other [ rooms ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/37404798.jpg ) that i do n't remember . 
  ** 3 ** just [ venice ] ( http://www.titianinn.com/files/titianinntv/themes/titianinntv/html/imagebank/photogallery-2/333.jpg ) , i hope i will go there someday ... ** 4 ** what do we have for rome ? 
  we have a lot of things !, 
  but not vatican city ( since it is not italy ) . 
  so , let 's take something i think is gorgeous : the [ altare della patria ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/piazza_venezia_-_il_vittoriano.jpg ) also called the vittoriano , in honour of vittorio emanuele ii , the first king of italy . 
  ** 5 ** now , a moment for nature . 
  going south in puglia , we have [ santa maria di leuca ] ( http://www.salentoreview.it/wp3/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/va0v2214-santa-maria-di-leuca-cmykpicc.jpg ) ; however what is beautiful about it is not the hamlet , but the [ creeks ] ( http://www.viaggi-lowcost.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/coste-del-sud.jpg ) , the [ caves ] ( http://static.turistipercaso.it/image/l/la-grotta-degli-innamorati/la-grotta-degli-innamorati_q9wse.t0.jpg ) , the [ things ] ( http://www.bebsantalucia.it/foto_animazione/7.jpg ) and the fact that people make blurry photos that would otherwise be perfect for this . 
  ** 6 ** [ alps anyone ? 
  ( honeybadger do n't give a shit ) also the 40 meters high [ piramidi di terra ] ( http://www.hoteldolomiten.com/img/slider/erdpyramiden_01.jpg ) formed from alternating periods of rain and drought on the terrain . 
  thanks erosion !, 
  let 's do this : you choose your number 7 !, 
  i want to know new wonderful places ( and i do n't have enough time to search something else ) edit : oh yeah , and we have a city that is called `` san pietro in bagno '' , which translates into `` saint peter in the bathroom '' ** bigger edit : ** since my choice regarding number four is n't well percieved , i will ask you to feign that , instead , there is [ villa farnesina ] ( http://www.grupporemimmobiliare.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/farnesi.jpg ) , it has beautiful [ rooms ] ( http://dseuropeanvacation.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/dsc_3529.jpg ) painted by raffaello and his school ; on the ceiling is depicted the [ horoscope of agostino chigi ] ( http://www.foliamagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/baldassarre-peruzzi-loggia-di-galatea-volta.jpg ) ( the first owner ) . 
  there is a legend on that one room i linked : it is said that michelangelo went there and chose to show off to his rival by painting [ himself ] ( http://ciaotutti.nl/wp-content/uploads/michelangelo-villa-farnesina.jpg ) ... though it is not true . 
  it was made by someone else . 
  another room of this villa is the [ loggia di amore e psiche ] ( http://www.artemagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/loggia.jpg ) ( i think it is cupid and psyche in english ) , where is [ depicted ] ( http://www.foliamagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/raffaello-loggia-di-amore-e-psiche-volta.jpg ) the famous latin story and symbolizes the love story of agostino chigi and francesca ordeaschi : she went from being a courtesan to marrying , in this very same room , the rich banker . 
  last but not least , the [ perspectives room ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hc-9hjeirte/u5vxxq-xmsi/aaaaaaaaduc/85a8bx7x1bu/s1600/sala+propsettive+farnesina.jpg ) where there also is a [ writing ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pr8fq4gq7mq/uw0juuhsrbi/aaaaaaaaah0/mfdxbmiyobs/s1600/dscn5087.jpg ) made by a lansquenet in 1528 , during the rome plunder , which says `` 1528 - why should n't i , the writer , laugh ? 
  the lansquenets made the pope run '', 
  cute is the best adjective for \u00c6r\u00f8sk\u00f8bing ... 
  i could go there and be `` awww '' for 5 hours also , m\u00f8ns klint are ( is , are ? ), 
  gorgeous !, 
  `` achievement : 888888888888 '', 
  i wondered why the russians did n't buy it back at that price . 
  ok , are we sure that these are actually russian ? 
  i see they have no markings , including the separatists ' ones , just like they did in crimea ; and i see that they are too much for just being separatists ... 
  but could someone reply me with more evidence about it , like a list of the veichles ? 
  i want to be sure about it as much as i was about the `` green men '' . 
  though i was born much later ( so i do n't know much about him other than the documentary told me ) , i 'd say that enrico berlinguer would change the opinions of these people . 
  `` russia : we have half the cars than your country , but have almost four times your fatal accidents '' [ i did some simple maths .

  [ original mapporn post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/25k83j/every_countrys_highest_valued_export_1200x646/ ) . 
  the first comment asks for [ higher resolution image ] ( http://thumbnails.visually.netdna-cdn.com/world-commodities-map_536bebb20436a.png ), 
  nah , i see a lot of news on tv . 
  nono !, 
  i 'm not referring to dell ` utri , but about all these links with mafia having coinfirmation . 
  if he could get punished , he would just have 2 hours of prison ... ya know , he evaded $ 300 million , and he just has to stay 4 hours a week for 9 months of community service . 
  if i do n't pay $ 3000 of taxes , i go to prison for some time . 
  how come i ca n't have a punishment in proportion ? 
  if i evade $ 3000 , i want 5 seconds of community service . 
  the only thing that surprises me is that i get to know this through a non-italian source ... 
  what about the `` holy shit , this thing is so gigantic i wonder how it can exist '' or the `` hs-ttisgiwhice '', 
  this is now / r/bestrussia . 
  our great leader will save us from evil capitalism in the name of freedom , komrades . 
  i did n't know about this . 
  are russians still there ? 
  if i go on google maps i see that area sorrounded by dashed red lines . 
  what is happening ? 
  edit : i 'm stupid . 
  the red line is the province/region it is in . 
  though my first question stays valid, 
  heh ... that 's the main problem of corrupption .
