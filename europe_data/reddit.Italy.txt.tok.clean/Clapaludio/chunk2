  but a man can dream, 
  surprisingly enough , italy does n't buy a lot of gas . 
  though here gas is widely used ( at least in my zone ) for thermosiphons and cooking instead of using induction stoves and air conditioning . 
  that would cut most of the gas consumption and therefore the importing . 
  i watched it 4 times . 
  once for italy , once for russia , once for mongols and ottoman empire , once for the last century . 
  thoughts : first off , i 'd like to point out that wwii did n't last until 1956 . 
  and omg !, 
  poland has been more active than i thought !, 
  it was little , than gets really big , then disappears , only to appear a century later and disappear immediately so it can re-appear after wwi and disappear in wwii , then reborn in the '60s . 
  that 's like a magic trick . 
  well done poland , chapeau, 
  needs more spaghetti, 
  i 'm pretty sure that if i got 25 farmers , in the 19th century , i could have conquered italy too . 
  thank you !, 
  do n't forget about ustica !, 
  though that is likely true ... 
  good . 
  good . 
  i always thought romania was a bad and shitty country . 
  but in the last years , the only things i have heard ( especially in the last 2 years ) were absolutely great . 
  i 'm proud that a country with such commitment is in the eu . 
  romania is great !, 
  once you finished with your corruption , could you come here too ? 
  well , you use catobar because you do n't have the money to buy s/vtol : c / s, 
  right !, 
  our air force is good , i wish i could be part of it ... we also made eurofighters , but with you all < 3, 
   italy nothing . 
  we are the only country that has 2 aircraft carriers in europe ... 
  do n't worry , that italian will probably be bribed soon and completely change his view . 
  i get the reference !, 
  * goes around happily because he learned something at school *, 
  7 mbps here at $ 30 . 
  and for some reason it continuously disconnects when using vocal chat programs like skype and teamspeak which , for someone who likes to play with friends , sucks balls . 
  felice festa dell ` europa !, 
  to nominate yourself for the peace prize you 'll just have to give your credit card number to a nigerian king . 
  well , what did you expect from us ? 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ feel ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ bad . 
  what a great job they did with this ad . 
  i 'd enroll for the ukranian army now ... 
  [ ] ( / celestiaiswatching `` why did you put best princess in the commment ? '' ), 
  is it mudazumo ? 
  i 'd like to see that part ... 
  i ca n't find images of hitler and ratzinger on the moon playing mahjong, 
  and it 's poland 's flag upside down . 
  and now i 'm sad : c, 
  i feel there could be a scale for cigarette 's `` powerfulness '' . 
  like : - regular -1 st reich -2 nd reich -3 rd reich - extra fascism - literally hitler, 
  illegally owned = / = illegally bought  first , philip cook [ professor of economics and sociology at duke university ] noted that it 's possible to buy a gun illegally from a gun store . 
  you can use a fake id or employ a straw purchaser ( someone who can pass a background check who buys the weapon on your behalf ) . 
   in 2004 , the government conducted its periodic survey of inmates in state and federal correctional facilities . 
  it found that among inmates who had a gun when they committed their crime ( 16 percent of all prisoners ) , about 11 percent had bought the firearm at a retail store , a pawn shop , a flea market or a gun show . 
  another 37 percent had gotten it from a friend or family member . 
  about 40 percent said they got it illegally on the black market , from a drug dealer or by stealing it . 
   but the same caveats apply . 
  a retail purchase might not have been legal and a gift from a family member might not be illegal .

  but still ... 
  thanks !, 
  okay , at least if it 's not fixed we can always pressure meps to not approve it . 
  i do n't think it 's * that * far from finished , considering obama is pushing to have it complete by the end of this year and that the negotiation have been running for 3 years . 
  will it be proposed to the european parliament ? 
  or only the members ' parliaments ? 
  or only the commission ? 
  what can we do ? 
  can we stop it ( apart from protesting ) in some way ? 
  will the ttip go through the european parliament ? 
  if so , should we contact our mps ? 
  we also have laws against drugs , does n't prevent people from smuggling them in . 
  that 's the police and intelligence 's job to intercept smuggling , it 's not laws that prevent these things . 
  the difference being that the shootings in the us are done with legally bought guns ( mostly ) , while the paris attack were made with weapons bought from black market and smuggling . 
  trump could also wear a hat with a wind turbine !, 
  if you do n't want to be on the right side , do n't complain when you are on the wrong one . 
   the predominantly favoured option is `` send the jews in boats to germany '' that being now , not in a future where you lend palestinians a hand . 
  the fact that it was under mandate does n't mean people in palestine were part of the british empire . 
  there were also palestinians doing governing stuff . 
  your example would be more suitable if you said british moved to australia . 
  i do n't think that 'd be a problem under the empire ... 
  is n't it what happens usually ? 
  jewish people get killed in nazi germany , people think jews are on the right side ; pinochet kills any opposition publicly in a stadium , the victims are on the right side ... you 'd be the ones to be defended , instead of being blamed for this . 
  it 's not that i like to say you are in the wrong , but that 's how it is . 
  you * can * do something though . 
  for starters , elect someone who does n't retaliate continuously , someone who wants better relations with palestinians is needed ; one that starts the process without waiting the other side and help palestinians . 
  with time , a peaceful solution ( be it two-states or one-state ) will lay down by itself , hamas would n't have a reason to exist and , by playing nice , you 'd have a lot of foreign support in any case ( the us would n't ignore israel like it did in the past year or more ) . 
  of course , both sides have extremists , just like in any nation ( unfortunately ) , but with peace it 'd be nothing compared to today . 
  you ca n't excuse massacres with massacres . 
  if jews lived in palestine now and were the ones persecuted ( so without extremist jews burning palestinian houses ) , i 'd be on your side . 
  that 's actually what * you * think . 
  did n't you say that palestine is your land ( and thus will eternally be ) because you originated there no matter the demographic ? 
  lol i 'm pro-immigration !, 
  i would be against it if immigrants started to proclaim their own independent country inside mine . 
  nono !, 
  i 'm saying we ca n't know because jews created israel instead of living alongside palestinians . 
  that 's an alternative history you hypothesised when talking about living in palestine `` as a persecuted minority '' . 
  shiny collective farms that proclaimed themselves independent from the land they immigrated to . 
  yes , exactly . 
  does n't seem like jews were the majority before 1948 ... 
  in fact muslims were 68 % while jews 32 % https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_palestine, 
  more than 100 years before ( and before the shoah ) . 
  i 'm talking about 1946 and on .
