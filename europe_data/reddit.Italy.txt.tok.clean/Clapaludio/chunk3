  it 's the same thing : you still unrighteously stole ( and keep stealing ) land from those who were currently living there . 
  edit : without considering that christians originate from there too . 
  yes , but we ca n't know if you 'd persecuted . 
  all we know is that now you are persecuting palestinians and occupying more of their land with your settlements . 
  you are basing off your position by saying `` we were there once '' . 
  now spain is part of italy because it was part of the roman empire . 
  not jews , any population that tries to overthrow the native one . 
  just like istria and dalmazia were n't given to italy after wwi because the great majority there were n't italians . 
  exactly !, 
  just like israel they stole it from those who inhabited it !, 
  or am i wrong ? 
  palestine too was an established state . 
  though under british mandate , it was a country just like the others ( just like syria and iraq ) . 
  why are you talking about an immigration that happened 500 years ago that 's not even an immigration because it 's ** in the same nation ** ? 
  they did n't even come from outside the ottoman empire since it had those territories . 
  as if i went to ravenna and then be considered an immigrant ... 
  the hell ? 
  you think a population made of those who immigrated centuries ago and is in the majority is n't native ? 
  let 's make an example : europeans emigrate to america , they are under imperial control in the territory of america and identify as americans . 
  after 300 years of being there , some swedes immigrate and declare a nation on the territory of americans , why should n't i think the americans are the natives ? 
  edit : typo, 
   think they would enjoy their freedom ? 
  then we should strip palestinians of the freedom to live on their own homeland ? 
  of course they do n't mind , it 's palestinians who live in ruins behind a wall with an embargo . 
  they mind since it was their land before israel was created . 
  why create it then ? 
  if they did n't mind being with arabs , they could have lived in palestine without `` colonies '' and a country ... edit : care to explain the part about prosecution and me being self righteous ? 
  i did n't understand it much . 
  yes . 
  but anyway that does n't mean they can ignore the local population . 
  if i said palestinians everyone would have said `` but they were under england 's rule '' or `` but there were ottomans before that so they did n't inhabit that land for long '' . 
  i mean the people who inhabited that land for various centuries . 
  true , i generalised there . 
  though it 's the religion they had that made it possible . 
  kind of . 
  though the difference is that there was no war or revolt to conquer it and establish that territory as israel , and that it is against the auto-determination of peoples : a un and league of nations principle . 
  your comment is biased as hell !, 
  muslims are not terrorists !, 
  how can you say that there 's no palestinian identity ? 
  you are gay ? 
  do you like being stripped of your rights and will because of who you are ? 
  maybe that 's what palestinians feel too you know ? 
  when they get bombarded and shot for trying to resist the people who took their land . 
  regards : a socialist atheist italian . 
  no , before that . 
  talking about the un . 
  the war was a consequence of that . 
  why could n't have jews gone elsewhere then ? 
  so `` jordanian and egyptian immigrants '' ( because of course they did n't give birth to other people in the past centuries of living there ) who inhabited the land by the majority should go away because someone decided , without asking the locals , that there would be a new country on their homeland ... 
  yes , that really makes sense . 
  i do n't care if israel exist . 
  the problem is how it was created . 
  what the hell man ? 
  stop replying to my comments with bullshit anti-muslim propaganda . 
  it 's not a fucking religion war , we are talking about people dying because no one cared to listen to palestinians in the '40s !, 
  but did greeks , romans and jews inhabit palestine in the 40s and 800 years before ? 
  yeah , the natives have to fuck off but , for some reason , jews should n't ? 
  that 's kinda not okay mate . 
  the shoah does n't make it ok for a group of religious people to have a country created on a soil where other people live , disregarding it completely . 
  [ summary of your comment ] ( http://m.imgur.com/gallery/edxu3eu ), 
  very true, 
  sorry , it was a question : /, 
  hamas is the response to israel not giving a fuck of palestine , they would never back down if it is n't israel the first to move . 
  shush !, 
  you have banca etruria !, 
  that 's enough !, 
  the problem is not jews then , but how the un created israel . 
  while now the problem is israel crushing natives . 
  yeah , of course . 
  but the cause of hamas is the fact that palestinians are ignored and crushed by israel ( just like they were ignored when the un created israel on their soil ) . 
  it 's israel that has to start the peace . 
  like , i do n't know , removing the embargo on gaza as well as the retaliation bombardments and that giant wall for example ... 
  if they stay evil , hamas will stay . 
  the difference is that arabs where there . 
  when i talk about `` someone else 's soil '' i mean the local population , not the rulers . 
  britain had mandates over palestine , as well as iraq for example . 
  so by your logic iraqis could have been ignored and another different nation could be created over their soil just because ? 
  who said i liked kosovo 's self determination ? 
  or the whole break up of yugoslavia ? 
  true . 
  but have you thought of the cause of hamas ? 
  do you think * they * are the ones who have to move first towards peace ? 
  and arabs lived there for more than 800 years until israel was created ... oh well , to suit your example better , the romans lived there too 2000 years ago . 
  i 'm not hating israel . 
  i 'm hating how people did n't respect the native population of palestine , a population that was there for a lot of time too !, 
  okay , it 's true that their country was taken , however that does n't mean they are entitled to that land forgetting there are other people who lived there for more than 600 years ... 
  jews have been in many places for more than 800 years because of diasporas , does that mean they should have at least a city-state in the middle of , like , ten countries ? 
  or should the vatican hold the whole of italy because `` christians have been here for 1500 years '' ? 
  i 'm implying that the ** native population ** was disregarded when some decided it was a good idea to create a new country there . 
  is it that difficult for people to understand it * may * piss you off if someone decides ( without the people consensus ) your land is now part of another country really different from yours ? 
  i 'm not making fun of your grandfather , but at your disproportionate count of deaths provoked by communism and , most importantly , the fact that you are clearly a fascist . 
  edit : though that video was blocked , i 've seen some of the others . 
  `` the origin of the white man '' and `` jewish ownership of white slavic slaves '' iirc ... really not nazi stuff clearly . 
  i think because it was long ago and not happening right now . 
  oh all right . 
  btw would they mind if i built some houses for the poor finns ? 
  then where do hungarians go ?
