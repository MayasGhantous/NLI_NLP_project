  where does that come from ? 
  you do realise that communist at the time meant atheist or dead ? 
  can i be the second ? 
  i want to also moon the earth from the moon . 
  pls, 
  i like that they are already working on it . 
  ca n't wait for 2040 !, 
  shit dawg , that burn made it all the way back to france . 
  as a protectorate , like syria . 
  that does n't mean one can set up a country on it disregarding the local population . 
  arabs owned it . 
  after their country was created on someone else 's soil . 
  thanks m8 , very kind to help . 
  oh wow immediately after the collapse . 
  i should research that . 
  really ? 
  when did that happen ? 
  it did n't change the name though . 
  there was the ussr ( that made most of the decisions ) of which the socialist republic of russia was a part . 
  the soviet union then disappeared completely and the socialist republic of russia became russia . 
  you mean the soviet union . 
  and it does n't exist so it ca n't pay back ... edit : i 'm wrong . 
  but ... we have no dominoes here, 
  in my country i see there 's not much information ( on mainstream media ) on the candidates ' proposals or history apart from trump 's . 
  no one i know , for example , had heard about sanders before i told them ... 
  more exiled than our last king, 
  * ahem *, 
  hah , if you do this to your italian friend , the police would n't even find the body . 
  maybe parts of it . 
  in pizzas . 
  sent to your loved ones . 
  you are now banned from / r/italy, 
  i wanted do use the same word , perhaps `` against human rights '' would have been even better though . 
  imprisoning a man is also `` undemocratic '' , but that does n't mean a thief should not be in prison ... 
  i just want to say that the italian anthem is most commonly referred to as `` inno di mameli '' or `` inno d'italia '', 
  and then people say america won the cold war ... 
  oh dear ... this is even worse than i thought . 
  this is technically true since , you know , the usa gave money to armed groups that are now terrorist groups just to get rid of the ussr 's influence ... 
  can we have gorbachev as president ? 
  i want to see what he wanted to do with the soviet union without yeltsin . 
  no , we only have * renewables * ... 
  you are now moderator of / r/ankaryang, 
  `` sarajevo has wanted to apply on several occasions , but the 28-nation eu said each time it had to further improve its economy , justice system , rule of law , public administration and political institutions to be able to become a candidate - ** a message brussels reiterated on monday again . 
  ** '' `` will not be given the candidate status for now '' no bosnia and herzegovina is not , the eu knows , and that 's why it will take years only to make it a candidate . 
  if that happens , he/she gets all the things right and the eu still ignores it , be sure there will be some movements to ask for turkey 's membership . 
  if it 's not the heads of the eu , the people will at least make them know . 
  i hope after erdogan respectable people will take power . 
  so let 's use a military ship to sink migrants . 
  now you have human rights associations and people protesting , probably un sanctions . 
  the problem is that they know they can die . 
  how many have died in the mediterranean ? 
  and how many die in the desert to get across the sahara without us knowing ? 
  has it stopped them ? 
  nope . 
  it wo n't solve much shooting them either . 
  many of the migrants are syrian , right ? 
  most would get back to syria with a new democratic government . 
  we should start there to solve our problems , and then ( when we are completely out of the recession ) care about improving africa . 
  yeah , killing innocent people is the answer . 
  it 's not like there would be protests everywhere and news constantly reporting that ( and people going to prison , because killing an unarmed man is illegal ) . 
  besides , it might spark the reaction of eu countries making them more willing to accept migrants so that they can excuse themselves or show they are against such an extreme measure . 
  so you think we should spend billions to not let anyone in ( mare nostrum costed 110 million a year ) and to `` help them at home '' ? 
  how do we deal with ships full of people starving wanting to get in the eu who crossed half of africa ? 
  do we send them back and leave them to imprisonment in libya ? 
  and even if we do n't count this , do you not think we are helping them at home now ? 
  does n't the eu give billions to africa to help it develop ? 
  how do you think we could do better in a continent that was spliced not regarding the population and that suffers intestinal conflicts ? 
  we would be spending way too much for that . 
  at least we ca n't do something really significant * now * . 
  for now the problem is that the immigrants are really concentrated ; we need to spread them across the eu fairly so that everyone shares a bit , without causing problems to some countries . 
  we are a union , for pete 's sake , if one falls , everyone does . 
  this period will be used to improve he eu in the years to come . 
  let 's stick together !, 
  many syrians are valuable since they have education and experience . 
  the problem really is integrating the poorest migrants like somalis and ethiopians , who escape from hunger and militias/dictatorships . 
  i think it 's a moral imperative to help them too , although it 'll be difficult . 
  edit : til wanting to help people gets you downvotes . 
  `` in varietate concordia '' ? 
  yes , of course i have an id . 
  however i meant that it would be a bother for me because i do n't have a passport . 
  well , i do n't have a passport ... 
  this post is basically my favourite eu motto : `` in varietate concordia '', 
  meanwhile , in [ milan ] ( http://immagini.insella.it/sites/default/files/anteprima/blocco-traffico-milano-2013.jpeg ) . 
  ( there was a smog warning , only public transport could go around ), 
  probably gomorra ( tv serie ) . 
  but i 've not seen it so i am not sure . 
  nice !, 
  not communist , but [ fucking ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8157/6990622280_4165674bb1_b.jpg ) [ horrible ] ( http://www.ansa.it/webimages/large/2014/2/14/aa8a33952e1057805af3e4876cbf04c9.jpg ) . 
  [ ] ( / implyra ) implying i can draw a boot decently ... [ ] ( / sp ) i mean , there are simplier countries to draw ... take france ... 
  shhh !, 
  have you even seen how bad i drew sardinia ? 
  it looks like a freaking lung ahahaha, 
  [ italy ... it looks so wrong ] ( http://imgur.com/fbsewug ), 
  i laugh on the outside . 
  i cry on the inside . 
  little thing : in my last english interrogation ( do n't know how it 's called in english actually ) i said `` he inventededededede telephon to speakings abboutz in de theater ... 
  but everyone looked at me in a strange way . 
  except two who laughed . 
  whatever . 
  `` now it 's de time of lunch ! '',
