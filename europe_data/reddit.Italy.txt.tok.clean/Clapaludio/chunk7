  so , leave voters , how much of * that * money could have gone to the nhs ? 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ does n't ^ ^ ^ work ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ fuck ^ ^ ^ it, 
  i like how people blame the eu for the austerity and shit , but do n't blame the ruling party , the center-right epp ... what the hell guys ? 
  if you are unsatisfied do n't vote and convince others to not vote for the epp in the next election . 
  we want you in the eu . 
  fuck uk , come in the cool club with euro !, 
  that 's the place . 
  how is it normal to pay that much in restaurants there ? 
  for that price i want the fucking pope to kiss the bottle . 
  yeah , i thought it happened only in italy ( especially in the north ) , but it seems it happens a bit everywhere, 
  a restaurant who wanted to trick tourists from what i see . 
  i 've been there one day , but people seemed nice to me . 
  though i had to pay $ 7,50 for one litre of water ... the fuck ? 
  worked perfectly for the guys in the pranados stadium, 
  the hell ? 
  are you really saying that a fascist dictatorship is better than a democratically elected government ?? 
  ( and that venezuela is socialist ? 
  they do n't even have workers ' councils and not many things have been taken by the government ), 
  it does n't work like this !, 
  we are italians for fuck 's sake , we should bribe everyone reading this post obviously !, 
  tell that to chile, 
  i completely agree , but that does n't make it a fair point for leaving the eu . 
  so the thing went from `` eu is undemocratic '' to `` the eu should be impartial on the brexit referendum '' i see . 
  then they would call it boaty mcboatface . 
  that would be so awesome i 'm going to support brexit . 
  i meant someone else * in the eu parliament * . 
  i explicitly said `` epp group that was elected by citizens to lead the eu '' i did n't mean on a national level . 
  my stance persists : you can blame schulz and the epp , but not the eu . 
  same goes for that article . 
   they actively backing the vote remain campaign over here . 
  problem ? 
  the anti-eu parties are also backing the brexit , does it mean they should n't ? 
  and influencing does n't mean actively try to prevent something , as your articles suggested . 
  you had the referendum in 1975 on the eec , the uk voted to remain . 
  then the uk decided to not do referendums to ratify things like the maastricht treaty , all the other stuff was done by the uk politicians ... 
  ** - uk politician ** `` our agriculture policy is now controlled by brussles ... trade policy ... industrial policy '' it 's so undemocratic that we even vote for the eu parliament and we have the heads of governments too ( who are voted by the citizens ) . 
  what a disaster , someone else we appoint decides for us and other 28 countries !, 
  -- ** - portugal article ** * it 's false to call the ps an `` euroskeptic party '' , being it in the s&d . anti-austerity is right . 
  * it was not `` banned '' ( very sensational title , ai n't it ? ), 
  * it was the president 's decision to not hand the government to the socialists , not the eu 's * from wikipedia :  on 22 october , president an\u00edbal cavaco silva controversially designated pedro passos coelho to form a new government , which after taking the oath of office had 10 days to submit its programme in parliament . 
  but the ps , be and cdu had already stated that they would call a motion of rejection to bring down the government . 
   the government programme was to be voted in the parliament on 10 november . 
   the socialist party reached agreements with the three other left-wing parties : the left bloc , the communists and the greens . 
  on 10 november , the portugal ahead [ `` winning '' party ] government programme was rejected in a vote of no confidence by a vote of 123 to 107 mps . 
  on 26 november , a new government was established as a socialist party minority government led by prime minister ant\u00f3nio costa . 
  ca n't see the problem ... -- ** - referendums ** i 'll just take a couple of them because i do n't want to waste too much time . 
  * denmark referendum on the maastricht treaty , from wikipedia :  as the maastricht treaty could only come into effect if all members of the european union ratified it , the edinburgh agreement , negotiated in the months following the referendum , provided denmark with four exceptions ** which eventually led to denmark ratifying the maastricht treaty ** in a 1993 referendum [ which was accepted and thus it 's okay ] . 
  * the french referendum on the constitution was n't ignored , same for the dutch one . 
  in fact the eu constitution was trashed later . 
  -- ** - austria **  the new president 's conciliatory language contrasted with a statement made earlier this year , when he said that if elected president , he would not swear in a new chancellor who wanted to `` destroy a united europe '' , such as the fp\u00d6 's strache , and that he would consider dissolving parliament and calling for new elections instead . 
  has he ? 
  no ... and again , it 's not an eu decision to do that , it 's that of a member state 's president . 
  -- ** - greece ** austerity sucks , i know it well . 
  however that is the fault of capitalism and the epp group that was elected by citizens to lead the eu . 
  it would be like blaming the uk parliament and the whole system because of the acts of the winning party . 
  the problem is the winning party , so vote someone else next time . 
  -- ** tl ; dr investigate by your own without believing everything the news gives you . 
  if you mean european as in `` a citizen of the european union '' , clarkson has already stated he 's a federalist ( i believe there 's an article about it somewhere up in the comments ) . 
  so he would . 
  do n't know whether may would though . 
  how is it undemocratic ? 
  kinda related but i am conflicted on whether or not hope the eu army wo n't get into nato . 
  because , on the one side , it is great to have a big alliance such as nato , and being in it as eu would also balance the us 's power . 
  on the other side , however , i also think that nato is really bad for international relations ( see border tensions caused by exercises ) and the eu army would have a different nature from nato . 
  moreover , if it does n't balance the us , then it would still be a puppet of the us 's will . 
  he just needs a hammer ... 
  yeah and he with his friggin ' friend priapus always getting laid ... 
  he 's complaining more about the militarisation index than the position imo . 
   any methodology which finds itself placing the dprk and the us on equal terms for international and domestic conflict may need to be reworked . 
  i do n't think so . 
  even those factors , which may have been used by the study , would still show america close to dprk . 
  because that 's how it is . 
  i do n't know if one could say that italy is 20 % more peaceful than dprk , since the study may be not using a standard scale ( for example , with a logarithmic scale , we 'd have to say that dprk is 200 times more aggressive than italy ) . 
  however i can kinda see how we are close to china . 
  dude that 's what * you * proposed . 
  i just made you see that your method would be far off from reality because it would say that dprk is peaceful . 
  probably a lot of data is taken into consideration for this research , one of which surely is past and current conflicts . 
  some other things one can consider to have that result could be : equipment ( tanks , planes , ships ) , % of gdp per capita spent on the military , soldiers considering total population , if there 's mandatory conscription , possession of nuclear weapons ( probably plays the biggest role also seeing where russia is ) , aggressiveness ( showing muscles , threats to nations , funding of military organisations in other countries , past conflicts , maybe even reasons of past conflicts ) ... dprk does giant but few things , the us does lots of things . 
  might be why they score similarly . 
  this may be what the militarisation index stands for , and while some of it plays a role in the us 's position , it also considers things that happen * inside * the country like number of crimes , shootings and who knows what else . 
   measure it by lack of conflict . 
  dprk has n't had a war for some time , while the us ... 
  yeah it 's like a bunch of friends who only want to enjoy life !, 
  now i 'm imagining bacchus drunk while on a shopping cart for some reason ... 
  and we would have been much more relevant if it was n't for fucking cadorna ... ugh ... [ vittoria mutilata intensifies ], 
  i do n't think to be biased , but italy is the best country in the world imo . 
  how do people know it 's real then ? 
  anyone can say there 's a bounty on someone at this point ... 
  yeah yeah ... just ... stay the fuck out of rome k ? 
  oh hell no , y' all destroyed a piece of our pretty fountain in rome !, 
  eli5 : how do people know about bounties on peoples ' heads ? 
  eli5 : how do people know about bounties on peoples ' heads ? 
  it 's okay but i think they should have done the same thing with eu countries not wanting to distribute refugees . 
  yes . 
  i 'm waiting for that to go to milan with champagne and confetti . 
  i do not agree with this idea . 
  an eu army would be way more efficient than 20 individual armies , it will cost less , there would be better integration with the various armaments ( all the countries ' planes for aircraft carriers can land on every country 's carrier for example ) and it would also boost the political integration of the eu ( common coastguards or other institutions ) . 
  why am i not completely agreeing though ? 
  because eu stands for peace , so an army would kinda be against this view imo ... 
  i guess that 's why you could n't have the referendum last year , was it ?
