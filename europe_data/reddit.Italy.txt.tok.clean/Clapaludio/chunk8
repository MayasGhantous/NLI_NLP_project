  nothing serious , really . 
  moreover the separatists are quite extinct since the northern league started to move towards nationalism and away from federalism . 
  but anyway our constitution says that italy is not divisible , so they were pretty much screwed . 
  you 've got a tag now . 
  i 'm ... 
  i 'm just joking man . 
  i 'm sorry it was n't clear :(, 
   horses = hiiiii am i the only one imagining the horse like that guy who is easily embarassed so goes `` hii ^ i ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ i '' from the other side of the room ? 
   communism as bad as nazism what is this , / r/worldnews ? 
   it 's part of human nature to put your own interests first \\  implying the betterment of your own conditions as well as that of others under a more equal system is not your interest, 
  let 's use ~ ~ senate ~ ~ palpatine and plebeian assembly instead, 
  that was brutal . 
  but true . 
  i 'd see something like that happening in italy ahahah, 
  `` damn immigrants !, 
  they come here and steal our internet connection ! '', 
   nice france gib us back nice and gioconda pls, 
  oh the children !, 
  why does n't anybody think of the children !, 
  holy shit dude, 
  trump said there has been a terrorist attack in sweden . 
  i think he meant swedes continuously do terror attacks on italian food . 
  every time you put ketchup on pasta an italian dies . 
  rip in pepperoni . 
  do n't step into italy if you are going to do that . 
  i 'm saying this for your safety : grandmas here can smell culinary horrors like that from miles away , you 'll get beaten up . 
  \\* hides in a pizza bunker , waits for enemies with a spaghetti rifle and meatball grenades *, 
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 
  should n't `` miss russia '' actually be `` miss ussr '' ? 
  because i ca n't see the misses for other sfsrs or ssrs ... 
  who 's the guy in moldova ? 
  he 's such a great driver !, 
  still salty he 's not in ferrari :(, 
  nothing on the masterplan talked about the price of the model y. 
  moreover it is a crossover based on the model 3 , so i doubt it 'll come much cheaper ( if it 'll be cheaper ) . 
  in fact , as it 's written on the masterplan part deux :  a lower cost vehicle than the model 3 is unlikely to be necessary, 
  i ca n't find tesla 's `` masterplan part two '' now , it 's written there what they are going to do in the next years, 
  more than $ 35k for the model 3 , and they wo n't make a car that will cost less iirc too bad , those cars look sexy compared to a leaf edit : `` a lower cost vehicle than the model 3 is unlikely to be necessary '' is written on the masterplan, 
  migrant quotas were also pushed by the countries that are most getting affected by the migrant crisis ( italy and greece ) . 
  because we need to share the burden being a union . 
  but no one wanted to , so we have only 3 countries doing something ... and while the populism here is rising because , not having a help from outside , we blame the migrants for everything ; in other countries it 's rising because the governments threw a tantrum over it and people are being bombarded by news on the migrant crisis ( see the problem at ventimiglia and the countries limiting free movement ), 
  lol how can you get mexico so wrong ? 
  the image is not complete clearly, 
  no way , that 's tajikistan, 
   meddling in election let me introduce you to chile and allende ... 
  for your information , italy has a peculiar kind of blasphemy . 
  we usually say `` god '' or `` jesus '' or any saint , like mary , and then put an adjective/noun ( most used is `` pig '' but anything goes , from `` triangular '' to `` manhole '' ) . 
  it 's really gross and frowned upon by a lot of people . 
  i do n't use them , but i wo n't stop someone i know from saying one ( depending on context ), 
  and starting a decade of economic crisis in russia that probably caused 7 million deaths . 
  kill the pandorian !, 
  i 've always read homelessness was at 0 % in the ussr . 
  am i wrong to say that ? 
  of course it was worse at the time . 
  i meant that * even * today people starve and/or do n't have a house today in europe , while in 1982 ussr these were n't problems . 
  not what i said, 
  yeah that 's really stupid to say of him . 
  there are still things like these happening in my mother 's village ffs . 
  it 's not a `` communist shithole '' . 
  especially considering they all had a house , a job and food , while a lot here ca n't say the same now . 
  `` sexual emergency '' should be something to expect in a porn movie taking place in a hospital ... not this . 
  yeah no , we 'll skip this silly international war ... we have more than enough violence here for this . 
  and panettone is clearly superior . 
   centre-right in favour of civil unions did n't forza italia vote for it ? 
  anyway yeah you are right , but if you are in a social democratic party you should not be economically liberal . 
  \\  renzi \\  center-left pick one, 
  the only thing i like about renzi is his thoughts on international relations especially regarding the eu . 
  because he essentially is a centre-right politician who , somehow , got to lead a social democratic party ... 
  consider also we start when we are 10 years old and have just 2 hours of spanish lessons per week ... 
  jk u cool as a cucumber m8, 
  hey !, 
  i 'm very fluent in spatalian !, 
  no really , not many have an acceptable level of english here because of teachers generally and then because we study english literature in high school instead of sticking with grammar , speaking and listening which would be way more useful if one had terrible teachers in middle school . 
  regarding spanish , we have to learn it for 3 years in middle school ( either that or french ) and almost no one keeps the knowledge a couple of years later . 
  for example i was very good at it but then i just forgot everything : now i can only understand a good part of what someone says ( and not much if written for some reason ) , but ca n't speak almost at all . 
  wait wait : we have had amazing drivers !, 
  arabs suck at driving , not us . 
  and by `` having sex '' we mean `` teach her how you put guanciale in carbonara , not bacon '', 
  there 's people who put ketchup on pasta ? 
  when did evolution go so wrong ? 
  i want to die , please !, 
  in italian we have the term `` passatempo '' meaning `` something to kill time with . '', 
  is it the same meaning ? 
  the page has been removed, 
  well i think it 's the competition system and ( most importantly ) the fact that it promotes hoarding money like this . 
  but i did n't read the article , because paywall . 
  \\  `` capitalism breeds innovation '' \\  fidget spinners choose one, 
  florence is great !, 
  i went there twice and had a great time . 
  just avoid pisa , because pisa merda, 
  so what ? 
  we are one of the most christian countries in europe and nonetheless we have none of that bullshit in our public institutions ( unlike in the usa ), 
  and that 's why we are never going to be prime ministers of the uk . 
  `` hmmm the naughtiest ? 
  well , probably that time my gf and i did it on the roof of a building while on her period and spanking her ... yeah that must be it '' well , also because we are not from the uk but eh ... 
  wait so they were n't actually asking may about the most *** naughty * ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) ** thing she 's ever done ? 
  iirc you ca n't do that because the roaming is free outside your country but only for 2-3 months, 
  / r/eyebleach is that way, 
  yep . 
  when you try to create a law to get you out of a trial i 'd think there * is * a problem .
