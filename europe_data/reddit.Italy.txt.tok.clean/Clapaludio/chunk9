  no , socialism just means workers ' control of the means of production . 
  it 's the various flavours of socialism that actually distinguish how the state/government ( if existing ) should operate in the new system and what it controls . 
  oh ... okay , next time i 'll do that :d, 
  i thought you were referencing monty python , so i continued . 
  i did n't want to offend you . 
  all your arts are belong to us, 
  i love it !, 
  `` the acqueduct ? '', 
  `` what ? '', 
  `` the acqueduct '' `` oh yeah yeah , they did give it to us yeah true '' `` and the sanitation '', 
  really ? 
  oh my ... it 's my new favourite word . 
  also because the implications are endless in italian !, 
  yeah , i am not worried about a conflict with italy too . 
  do n't you also have some kind of pastry called `` fika '' ? 
  i remember seeing it some time ago on / r/italy, 
  yep , me too being a dirty commie . 
  but cheerfulness is nice so i like them :d, 
  deal, 
  it comes from the fruit . 
  i think then `` cool '' comes from the genital meaning because genitals are cool ? 
  i do n't know about italian women though , the only figa i see actually comes from south america, 
  call it fiume at least or we are at war  :( then we are going to lose friuli-venezia giulia , switch sides and win the war . 
  just like when japan surrendered , we are not going to be invited to sign a peace treaty though , so we will still technically be at war . 
  after 50 years we occupy most of croatia and ask just for fiume to end the war . 
  okay ? 
  pretty please ? 
  \\* puppy eyes *, 
  we are very proud of our cheerful bersaglieri :(, 
  after a quick research : yes !, 
  the term `` figa '' actually comes from `` fica '' which is the vulgar ( or regional ) term for the fico ( fig fruit ) . 
  comes from the fact that an opened fig may remind a vulva . 
  anyway the terms `` fico '' or `` figo '' ( masculine ) and `` fica '' or `` figa '' ( feminine ) are also used to say something really cool or a very handsome person !, 
  [ i 'm talking about this ] ( https://youtu.be/6ablojv9uw8?t=36s ) the bersaglieri are famous for participating in the breccia di porta pia, 
  fuck it , take over the world and build some sewers, 
  now corsica ; then istria , dalmatia , nice , savoy and the mona lisa !, 
  why is that ? 
  asking for an allied country , not my own, 
  for context : in italian `` figa '' means `` pussy '' ( as in female genitals ), 
  [ [ fanfara dei bersaglieri intensifies ] ] ( https://youtu.be/6ablojv9uw8?t=36s ) edit : added link, 
  well not really a misconception : it does mean going to the root of society 's problems of course , but some may find the act of overthrowing capitalism a bit extreme ( alas ! ), 
  also a poorly-exectuted hdr mashup . 
  you can see some houses have the roofs lightly overlapped by the sky ninja edit : also look at the ship ... 
  there are in general many conspiracy theorists in that party . 
  the m5s is known for having people believing in chemtrails or that the moon landings were staged , but the worst is that some of these are in our parliament . 
  they started good , and in my city they have been doing a great job in these years , but on a national level they have become dangerous imo, 
  that 's just the south . 
  the north is only 100 years behind !, 
  we 're still rotating with the others though , just did a galilean transformation to show there are actually no forces tearing us apart . 
  exactly , and being centrifugal forces they are fictitious forces . 
  i think this may be the worst post of this sub to reach a significant amount of upvotes edit : oh wait lol i thought i was on / r/earthporn ... still shitty though, 
  yep , italy declared war on japan in 1943 when it switched sides , however it did n't get invited to sign the peace treaty with them . 
  probably , but also consider trotsky was for the revolution in more countries , so he would have not made the ussr a powerful industrial machine as fast as stalin did because more resources would be used to make other revolutions happen in the world, 
  nono , i mean that in second place there 's chinese food . 
  in first place there 's of course swedish cuisine !, 
  maybe i misunderstood something ... 
  i should investigate further maybe . 
  i mean : it 's a big company so i do n't think they would do something against eu regulations, 
  really ? 
  my data plan makes it so i can use one video streaming website with zero rating . 
  though , to be fair , that website is owned by the same company that owns my mobile isp so i think it 's okay ? 
   the food is irreplaceable yes . 
  i absolutely love chinese cuisine ( at least how i get it here ) . 
  it 's delicious , has a lot of variety and mixes very well healthy stuff too !, 
  however i 'm italian , so chinese food is in second place sadly ahah but it 's a close one to be honest . 
  it means your mobile operator may not count data used for some websites . 
  for example my current plan has 10 gb of internet/28 days but any data spent on one particular video streaming website ( wo n't name it ) does n't consume the 10 gb, 
   perfect size ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i still ca n't understand how people can justify the fact that they literally pay to be kept alive . 
  like wtf i am creeped out because i have to pay when i am ill and go to the doctor to get a visit and people have no problems with a person paying thousands because they have cancer ? 
  tbf i cringe also because ^ i ^ have ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ buy ^ ^ ^ ^ food, 
  [ raising a flag over the reichstag ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/raising_a_flag_over_the_reichstag ) is the one i 've always seen and also the one with the two-watches-guy . 
  if you go under `` taking the photo '' it says it . 
  though i 'm curious about this one then , can you tell me the name or link me the unaltered version ? 
  totally right, 
  was n't it another photo ? 
  the more famous one, 
   funnily enough , children see things in black and white i think the sentence you want to use is `` only siths deal in absolutes '', 
  yeah \\* sees flair * hey its me ur nation, 
  we 'll make them ^ ^ / s afterall we are technically still at war with them, 
   is it still a democracy if there 're no checks in place ? 
  i 'm confused about what you mean with checks , care to elaborate ? 
   in planned economy , everybody depends on government . 
  thus it 's very easy to suppress opposition . 
  well , if it 's democratic no , just like today in eu countries . 
  there are rights , there is a ( useful ) parliament , there are referendums and elections . 
  and , especially , power balance . 
  central planning can be politicised , true . 
  but would they be re-elected ? 
  probably not . 
  they could even be arrested in our society if they did it now , why not under a democratic socialism ? 
  look , i do n't think most say socialism is the cure to all the problems in our society ( like incompetence or intentionally bad behaviours ) , but a way of making more people less stressed or even happy . 
  not having to think about stuff like getting fired , paying your house or food is a privilege a few have ... deciding that every day a member of your family wo n't eat lunch because you do n't have enough money is not easy , nor right . 
  it 's a world power : if military parades take place it 's okay . 
  france , italy , germany , india , china all do military parades and no one beats an eye as far as i know . 
  they could celebrate ve as you said , which would be very nice i think , but when would they get to show their military power instead ? 
  afterall ve is about the winning of a war with an army . 
  i see what you mean . 
  that is by your definition of democratic in which businesses are in a market economy , while i think it just means `` controlled by the people '' . 
  the workplace would be controlled by the people under socialism for sure , but the state is what differentiates most of the socialisms .
