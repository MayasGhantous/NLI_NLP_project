not for long though ... 
  tunisia is surprisingly one of the most liberal ( if not the most liberal ) country of north africa and probably also the middle east . 
  i wish that referendums in my country had a ` denmark ' option aside from yes and no, 
  seriously , you should rename this picture : ` this cool bridge in france ... and the train above it ', 
  jesus man , how further does he have to specify that he was joking , does he literally need to write the word sarcasm on his forehead ? 
  same thing in sardinia only with sheep, 
  as an italian , i 'm also glad that we settled the long-lasting skirmish with the wine bottle . 
  half blue half green , seems legit , 
  because * made in italy * , that 's why . 
  it 's even the freaking [ tourism slogan ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/5dft71/map_shows_every_countrys_tourism_slogan_4500x3000/ ), 
  and i assume * gyna * must be like in 250th place, 
   a mix of arabic , ~ ~ italian ~ ~ * sicilian * and english ftfy, 
  it has a greater population than iceland despite being 300 times smaller, 
  where they talk a weird arab/sicilian lingo with few english loanwords, 
  i 'd say it 's more like a [ sink ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=bidet&amp;prmd=isvn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjg2c6gwffsahwevhqkht8dbleq_auibygb&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=524#imgrc=xmlll0o0qghsem: ), 
  wow , that 's impressive , i checked all of them and they are indeed correct , just this one seems incorrect according to google translator :  ~ ~ attraverso ~ ~ * di seconda mano * antra vertus = secondhand that said , you are almost making me want to study lithuanian , it looks like a fascinating language :d, 
   from time to time i find very similar words between our languages . 
  really ? 
  could you make some examples in merit ? 
  i would have never bet that such a different language like a baltic one could share similarities with my language , i 'm surprisingly amazed :d, 
  the best wines are hands down the tuscan and the piedmontese ones, 
  and build new islands as a pastime, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/2k2zodijnzy ), 
  hopefully , i wonder how their design will look like, 
  that 's what i have been doing for years , and i almost completed all the countries except the baltic states and cyprus ( and of course , the microstates ), 
  even more * memeworthy * than [ this one ] ( https://m.imgur.com/gallery/1zzpa ) ? 
  i did n't actually know that lentils made such beautiful flowers in their bloom . 
  one reason more to cherish an already amazing legume . 
  yeah !, 
  i just saw this video , my comment is the one on top :d, 
  sadly , you are right . 
  looking at some data on [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_europe?wprov=sfsi1 ) you can immediately notice how italy sticks out like a sore thumb , while slovenia on the opposite is very white . 
  religion has always permeated a lot of everyday life and also politics until today . 
  however luckily the younger generations are becoming more and more secular and most probably the share of those who support same sex marriage might change steadily in matter of years , just like it occurred to malta , which is still one of the most catholic countries . 
  the turning point though will happen when the church wo n't interfere anymore in the internal policy and where treated just like any other foreign state , with its goods and properties being taxed exactly like all th other ones . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_europe?wprov=sfsi1 ) you 're welcome, 
  i 'm italian and i agree with you . 
  i do n't know why they downvoted you, 
  you are right , it is catholicism . 
  the difference between italy and the neighboring countries though is that there is less secularism , and religion still takes on a major role in society , especially the older generations and in the south . 
  things are luckily gradually changing nonetheless, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/5953un/comment/d95q3l4?st=j2xevtz4&amp;sh=369115c7 ), 
  actually , afaik , it does . 
  the reason is because the main difference between animal fat and vegetable fat is that usually the former is saturated while the latter is insaturated fat , which can be more easily burnt off . 
  a major difference is also the way the fats are treated : frying them results in a largely increased fatty content , therefore diets reliant on big amounts of fried/deep fried food can create much worse effect on the body than plain oil ( or butter ) eaten raw . 
  that 's probably the reason why both the nordics and the mediterranean rank low , because of small amounts of fried food in their diets, 
  italy might not have a high obesity rate , but i swear i saw quite a lot overweight people in my country, 
  well , having been in gb several times , i can aussure that ( 1 ) in almost every city and town there is *** at least *** a fast food ( including wimpy , which ca n't be found elsewhere ) and ( 2 ) british people seem to be somewhat more sedentary than the average european . 
  also , the large usage of butter in meals instead of olive oil has its impact . 
  as bizarre as this may sound , that 's quite a [ common pasta sauce ] ( http://www.buttalapasta.it/articolo/ricetta-pasta-alla-boscaiola-con-panna/37015/ ) in italy, 
  thanks a lot for all your info and the link to the video , it was very interesting and useful, 
  uff portugal , first it was gay marriage , then came adoptions , later on light-drug liberalisation , more recently european cup win and even eurovision win !, 
  ! ... i 'm gradually starting to envy you from my peninsula . . 
  20k + , wow that 's a big number for such a small state . 
  may i ask you for what reason is russia particularly concerned in maintaining control over chechnya and not just make it another independent nation like the other caucasian states ? 
  from your window even sweden is far east xd, 
  i loved that city . 
  i remember having tasted there one of the best tapas in all my trip to catalonia . 
  and slovenia, 
  oh boy , you still have a long road ahead of you . 
  speaking of which , how did the situation evolve in chechnya ? 
  ( no sarcasm , genuine curiosity ), 
  could you express more clearly your pov ? 
  oh boy , this thread is about to get heated *** grabs popcorn ***, 
  tell me about it, 
  tell that to slovenia , heck they even support gay marriage more than my country , which has never been part of the eastern block ( and of which i 'm quite baffled for ranking so low tbh ), 
  . . which by the way ended in a stalemate ( one green and one blue pixel on the wine bottle ) :p, 
  has this subreddit indirectly become a battlefield between r/italy and r/france on who owns the most and/or best landscapes ? 
  i guess that makes sense , thanks, 
  i say flip it with the big 5 privilege to go straight to the final . 
  i think it 's counterproductive both because people get to listen to their songs just once , while twice for the others ( unless they get disqualified ) , and because it stimulates them to bring about better quality songs ( look for example at this year 's spain and germany ) . 
  also , most importantly , the f ing 3 minute limit . 
  if it were n't for that gabbani could have actually had a better chance in winning , as the song sounded perfect for 3:30 minutes , but not less . 
  but more in general i believe that that is really hindrance for making the song contest of a better quality , because it points less on creativeness and more instant catchiness, 
  then which continent would you deem the opposite shore to belong to ? 
  i hope not to sound like a jerk , but is this technically europe ? 
  to me it seems that it should be , however i heard many opposite views in matter, 
  wiwijuries were right : germany struggled not to get in last and in fact ... it actually did not technically , 
  is that some sort of savoury cinnamon bun ? 
  very similar to the vast usage of the word * cazzo * ( which literally means * cock * ) in italian : `` e che cazzo ! '', 
  --  `` what the hell ! '', 
  --  `` what the fuck are you doing ? '', 
  `` sticazzi '' --  `` who the fuck cares ? '', 
  ( elsewhere , chiefly northern italy ) `` sono incazzato '' --  `` i 'm so angry '' `` grazie al cazzo '' --  `` no shit , sherlock '' and so on, 
  today it 's may !, 
  may i even suggest r/megalophobia, 
  your welcome , 
  according to the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/palais_farn%c3%a8se ) it was simply sold to the french government at the end of the 19th century and was eventually leased for a period of 100 years in 1936 , however i do n't know more details than that, 
  what 's the meaning of the text written on top of france ? 
  err . . i guess the [ staircase ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=palazzo+farnese+caprarola&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=it-it&amp;prmd=imvn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjo9ym8-cltahwklsakhs77ammq_auicsgb&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=672#imgrc=wsd5bzshktyo9m: ) which in both palaces is coiled ? 
  i do n't know the roman palace because it 's not too easy to access the french embassy , however i can tell you that in rome there are also some other buildings with marvellous staircases , like bernini 's [ staircase ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=scala+bernini&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=it-it&amp;prmd=ismvn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjn06_g-8ltahwfkmakhylcdeiq_auibygb&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=672#imgrc=jbw0f0b6n6_h9m: ) in santa maria maggiore, 
  amazing palace , have been there numerous times . 
  one of the very few examples of pentagonal palaces in italy edit : apparently it 's the only example of pentagonal building in italy , since i have n't found any further samples aside from this one while doing some research . 
  he 's probably gone to meddle with some nymphs, 
  a concept that apparently veneto is n't very used to, 
  stop looking at me , i feel unsafe, 
  cin cin !, 
  ukraine can into homogay europe :p, 
  this merits to be way up on top . 
  still too many people have a biased view of italy , it 's time for them to open their eyes,
