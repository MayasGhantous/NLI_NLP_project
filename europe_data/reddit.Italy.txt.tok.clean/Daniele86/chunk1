  every time i read `` 19th-century fashion '' [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kzf1kgareo ) come to mind . 
  we know very well what happened in libya and one of this day we will return the courtesy to france . 
  `` freedom '' , yeah freedom from italian oil extraction contracts . 
  if you think libyan civil war was something spontaneous you can easily think that `` concerned citizen '' have `` found '' stingers in east ukraine too . 
  wait , are you saying that there is propaganda even on our side ? 
  how dare you !, 
  i still remember the [ french ( and nato ) ] ( http://www.wikispooks.org/blog/archives/359 ) armed `` libyan freedom fighter '' . 
  after 20 years of psy-ops and regime change pulled by nato we should envy moscow ? 
  russia is just copying our technique with modest success . 
  so you think that france is going use his nukes and suffer retaliation to save estonia from russian invasion ? 
  this is not credible . 
  this argument has its own merit . 
  problem is that letting nato go away would have implied a rearmed ( and possibly nuclear ) germany with his own foreign policy . 
  and this is too a nightmare scenario . 
   the submissive behaviour towards the usa should finally be ended . 
  without nato and usa nuclear umbrella we are all snacks for the bear . 
  yes basically it is an expert in taxation law and such .

  eu ca n't touch our precious gas pipeline , it is defended by a legendary [ six-legged dog ] ( http://www.eni.com/brand_eni/en/1_il_cane_a_sei_zampe.shtml ) . 
  side switching is in fact a feature of our war technique . 
  `` all warfare is based on deception '' hihihihi, 
   i think we should kiss that post world war pacifistic hippie dream goodbye , and start to man up . 
   but stuff like that makes me wonder if we are currently on the right side . 
  dear japan we are two old friends , we are organizing a reunion . 
  we should talk about climate change whale fishing and world domination / s, 
  if italy opt out euro will cease to exist in 48 hours . 
  however at the moment this is pure sci-fi , while technically doable there is no political consensus ( yet ) . 
  it 's no secret we always had good relation with moscow both in the pre and post 1989 world . 
  for putin era see [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_stream ) , [ this ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/8166090/wikileaks-to-highlight-putin-and-berlusconis-special-relationship.html ) and [ this ] ( http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/russia-to-buy-western-lince-mraps-06675/ ) . 
  it is actually worse than that . 
  italy in itself has at least three different foreign policy , washington , berlin and ( ! ), 
  moscow exert an undeniable influence in our politics . 
  so what ? 
  we are buying a lot of f-35 side with us or we will side with putin !, 
   maybe france was right when they told us to not re-unify germany ? 
  italian pm [ giulio andreotti ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giulio_andreotti ) used to say `` we love germany so much that we would prefer to have two of them . '' ( andreotti was quoting the french writer fran\u00e7ois mauriac ) .

  i mean try do the same in messico and in two weeks the [ 101 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101st_airborne_division ) will be on the ground . 
  indeed . 
  so you think that eu is pushing for financial regulation and controls on capital movement ? 
  at the moment i see no result but maybe you are right . 
  the euro project and financial deregulation are two sides of the same coin . 
  i 've never talked about conspiracy or evil germany i 'm just saying that the euro made it possible or at least made it easier . 
  every nation will undergo a painfull adjustment in the euro and out of the euro , i 'm not so stupid to think that scrapping the euro is going to solve everything but the euro is badly managed and is aggravating all of this problems . 
  in a sense if italy was germany there would be no problem in sharing a currency ( with germany ) but we still have a lot of problems so sharing a currency is a bad idea . 
   convergence in rates converging rate is the final result of capital flowing to the periphery . 
  you are confusing cause and effect . 
  this is like saying i gave crack cocaine and a gun to my son but it was ** his ** fault if he shoot his friend . 
  fixed exchange rate plus free capital movement plus financial deregulation is a poisonous combo . 
  it is not a irish government problem it is the way financialization work . 
  netherland austria and finalnd are going to blow up on private debt too , wait for it . 
  three years before physical euro was introduced every nation pegged its currency to ecu so in fact fixed exchange rate was already there 3 years before physical euro introduction :  the currency was introduced in non-physical form ( traveller 's cheques , electronic transfers , banking , etc. ), 
  at midnight on 1 january 1999 , when the national currencies of participating countries ( the eurozone ) ceased to exist independently in that ** their exchange rates were locked at fixed rates against each other , effectively making them mere non-decimal subdivisions of the euro . 
  ** the euro thus became the successor to the european currency unit ( ecu ) . 
  [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_euro#launch] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_euro#launch ), 
  the elections are making everyone nervous i guess . 
  spain was awash of capitals as a byproduct of the euro . 
  the implicit germany backing of your debt provoked the mispricing . 
  so in fact the euro made the bubble possible . 
  see [ this ] ( http://www.iea-world.org/docs/frenkel.pdf ) and [ this ] ( http://www.unich.it/docenti/bagnai/euro/frenkel.pdf ), 
  well `` the market '' price them as more safe . 
  because in germany inflation is right so no more easing ( conventional or not ) is needed . 
  and they are issued under english law not local law so they are ( very ) creditor friendly in case of default . 
  if draghi manage to let italy slip in deflation it 's game over for our public debt and for the eurozone . 
  so i think he will pull out some trick sooner or later . 
  hiihih she should say mad things on telephone and wait for obama 's reaction just for fun .
