  it 's easy , they know everything .

  europe ubuntize thy self . 
  now we can democratically choose what model of austerity is going to tear us apart . 
  do you prefer the imf flavour or the buba flavour ? 
  we may be corrupt and ungovernable but germany 's economic strategy is suicidal even in the medium term . 
  it is killing his own export market . 
  we need an ama : `` lisp wizard , i worked for nsa and i will explain all of our genius tricks ( before they kill me ) '', 
  just think about the added value of being log in free `` no log in needed we already know who you are ... [ evil laugh ] '' . 
  the motto could be `` nsacloud spying on you since arpanet '' . 
  it is easy : if you lose any file just ask the nsa they have the backups of basically everything and it is free and uncapped service , i like dropbox but i 'm planning to shift to nsacloud because it is very easy to use service . 
  even if we are ( part of ) the founding fathers it still is undemocratic , i do n't understand your argument . 
  in truth it is propaganda on both side . 
  the thing that make me laugh is that we never voted for joining the eu but everybody here feel like democracy champion . 
  nobody give a # $ % & about democracy it is just the same old game , it is called geopolitics . 
  we can try an invasion but i think we should wait for the summer . 
  ** edit ** obviously i 'm not serious, 
  i understand this too , in theory it is a good argument i mean from a rational standpoint it make a lot of sense , but then the more the crisis worsen the more the german position get hawkish ... 
  hihii tell this to the german taxpayer . 
  i do n't know if he is going mad but at the moment he won without fighting . 
  lao tzu would be proud . 
   the combination of a common currency with national politics is poisonous . 
  without closer political and fiscal union , including a proper banking union , pooling of debt and sharing of risk , the benefits of currency union are a chimera . 
  the reality will be debt deflation and depression without end . 
   well , not quite without end , actually -- it is all too easy to see how this could end . 
  the euro is the biggest threat to peace in western europe that i have seen in my lifetime . 
   so let 's end it now . 
  rather than waiting for country exits and disorderly collapse ( probably when the franco-german alliance fractures , as it will if france heads into depression ) , we should put in place plans now for orderly wind-up of the euro and restoration of national currencies . 
  we should offer debt forgiveness and international aid along the lines of a marshall plan to those countries that have been so badly hurt by the misbegotten euro project . 
  and we should decapitate the hydra banks that have sucked the life out of the eurozone periphery countries . 
   the euro is a failed experiment . 
  we should not waste any more effort trying to make it work . 
  it is time to consign it to the dust of history .

   it is not easy to achieve concrete victories when the political class betray our rights and sell out to capital . 
  it 's hard to win when the state apparatus defends the haves , and rolls back our democratic rights and freedoms . 
  the task of change is arduous , when the media are hijacked by private interests . 
  still , there are victories , big and small , showing us the way . 
  end the euro before the euro end europe .

  i was talking europe wide but of course we were liberated too . 
  yeah slovenia you waited a little bit longer . 
  we are sorry but you know there was the cold war at the time and so many tanks and so many nukes too . 
  the eu granted nothing , [ operation overlord ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_overlord ) granted `` freedom , democracy and peace '' . 
  you do n't understand the euro-dream . 
  euro-dream : 0 ; history : 3 ; last notable attempts : roman empire . 
  a painter from vienna with funny mustache . 
  this time is obviously different , you anachronistic paesan . 
  to understand what europe can and ca n'to do you need to follow the gas pipeline . 
  hihi well actually renzi is just another mutation of berlusconi . 
  berlusconi , like the t-1000 from terminator 2 . can assume various form . 
  yeah , like a wounded velociraptor . 
   what was my point in may 2012 ? 
  a very simple one . 
  since its entry in the eurozone france , like italy , or finland , or spain , had experienced a steady worsening of its net external lending , and since 2005 it had become a current account deficit country ( i.e. , a net foreign capital importer ) . 
  for that reason , france would have been forced to put into practice an austerity policy.why ? 
  ** because in the absence of the re-equilibrating mechanism provided by exchange rate flexibility , austerity is the only instrument a government has in order to reduce its external deficit . 
  ** if the nominal exchange rate does not respond to external imbalances , you need to engineer some unemployment , in order to reduce wages , thereby fostering exports , and cutting imports ( as a consequence of the fall in income ) . 
  as simple as that . 
  finally a solution to mass unemployment . 
  again wait for jan 2015 for surprise bank holiday . 
  the euro has at most another year of life . 
   the euro is a walking dead . 
  if you noticed the [ declarations by jens weidmann ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/30/us-ecb-weidmann-idusbre99t1ar20131030 ) , the governor of the bundesbank , when he told that the next stress test on the banking sector will be performed by allowing for different risk coefficients for sovereign bonds , this means that the `` whatever it takes '' statement by mario draghi was a bluff , because if mario draghi was right , government bonds would be riskless . 
  that means that in germany some people are getting sick of that situation , and want to dismantle the euro , and the declarations by hans-werner sinn , that berlusconi was sacked because he was preparing a euro exit for italy , are also very telling in this respect . 
  sinn has always said that southern countries should go out of the euro , and he is a german economist . 
  if he makes such a statement it is a very important political signal . 
   well , you are the good guys , you did the reforms , that 's good , your goods are more affordable , fine , we will buy them , wonderful , you are a surplus country , bravo , clap the hands , but if in order to buy german goods we had to buy german currency , the german currency would appreciate , and that would re-establish an equilibrium . 
  and it is a market !, 
  we are living in a soviet system , where we have planned the most important price for an economy , the price of its currency .

  and sweden is doing better than finland . 
  the euro is part of the problem . 
   the drive for the euro has been motivated by politics not economics . 
  the aim has been to link germany and france so closely as to make a future european war impossible , and to set the stage for a federal united states of europe . 
  i believe that adoption of the euro would have the opposite effect . 
  it would exacerbate political tensions by converting divergent shocks that could have been readily accommodated by exchange rate changes into divisive political issues . 
  political unity can pave the way for monetary unity . 
  monetary unity imposed under unfavorable conditions will prove a barrier to the achievement of political unity . 
  aug 28 , 1997, 
  we should declare and rapidly lose a war against denmark , after just two weeks of foreign occupation italy would be a silent , civilized and elegant cyclotopia . 
  this is the cyprus model . 
  we are at 3.5, 
  we need at least strong bilinguism . 
  every worker should be able to go everywhere in the union and be able to find work only speaking english . 
  again labour mobility is requested in a currency area otherwise it will develop the asymmetry we are seeing . . 
   do you advocate for the total disappearance ( eventual death ) of regional/local languages god no !, 
  what i 'm saying is that we must be english proficient . 
  if we want this dreamed european superstate then national languages must become what dialects are today . 
  because denmark is a civilized and open society , we should `` danishize '' europe . 
  yes what i was trying to say is that language is indeed a barrier , so a eu wide official language is requested if we want to achieve labour mobility . 
  but the feeling i have is that they are only interested in capital and goods free movement . 
  austria and italy share a border , austria has low unemployment ( relative to italy ) and guess where division of italian unemployed are going ?
