  london !, 
  this is one of the reason why the currency area is not working as expected . 
  this is what i 'm trying to explain with my provocative comment . 
  this subreddit live in some strange non-euclidean space . 
  they down vote nationalism but they downvote federalization too !, 
  you want use ? 
  then we need one language one law one currency one fiscality and so on ... you don ` want it ? 
  then we need to go back to national currency and so on . 
  time of half measure ended , the euro-zone is collapsing . 
  we are working toward a flat no barrier free market world etc etc ? 
  labour mobility must be the standard response to crisis ? 
  then national language , labour law and welfare are only a cost . 
  the it sector is already ( basically ) english 100 % . 
  leave national language to culture and art contest . 
  ** edit ** if you downvote this comment then explain to me why we need to share a currency ( $ ) when we do n't want to share labour law , welfare , language , fiscality and so on ... this subreddit is a living cognitive dissonance . 
  this will take place in 2017 . 
  it already is a de-facto standard for world comunication . 
  we should all default to it as first language . 
  sorry france maybe in a parallel universe napoleon won the war and everybody speak your wonderful language . 
  currency area was ill designed ** this ** is destroying europe . 
  a lot of nobel said that , friedman ( mr monetarism himself ! ), 
  said in 98 that at the first serious shock eurozone would have blown up . 
  blaming germany is a risky simplification . 
  ** edit **  ... the more likely possibility is that there will be asymmetric shocks hitting the different countries . 
  that will mean that ** the only adjustment mechanism they have to meet that with is fiscal and unemployment : ** pressure on wages , pressure on prices . 
  they have no way out . 
  with a currency board , there is always the ultimate alternative that you can break the currency board . 
  hong kong can dismantle its currency board tomorrow if it wants to . 
  it does n't want to and i do n't think it will . 
  but it could . 
  ** but with the euro , there is no escape mechanism . 
  **  suppose things go badly and italy is in trouble , how does italy get out of the euro system ? 
  it no longer has a lira after whatever it is -- 2000 or 2001 -- so it 's a very big gamble . 
  i wish the euro area well ; it will be in the self-interest of australia and the united states that the euro area be successful . 
  but i 'm very much concerned that there 's a lot of uncertainty in prospect . 
  professor milton friedman interviewed by radio australia , 17 july 1998, 
  we are all in this together , in the end they will find a cooperative solution , ( i hope ) common sense will prevail . 
  but they should stop using propaganda on both side to divide . 
  this strategy is summoning a beast they will be unable to control . 
  there is no `` us '' and `` them '' deutsche bank is doing exactly the same trick like unicredit in italy and bnp in france do n't be naive . 
  germany during the 2003-2005 missed the deficit of 3 % i do n't remember finland asking for invasion . 
  albania do n't listen to them we like you , we are going to build our [ empire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_empire ) with [ hookers and blackjack ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5tzmdbxtrq ) . 
  yeah the war machine is already running , italy is deciding how many side switch this time . 
  do n't worry we have a [ man ] ( http://binaryapi.ap.org/97655a7d8787482dae1e3b4d149d2bd9/460x.jpg ) in the eurotower . 
  i 'm not linguist but i 've a italo-french friend that keep repeating me that french is closer to sicilian than to italian . 
  is your username referred to the legendary husker du [ album ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zen_arcade ) ? 
  if so you are cool `` a prescindere '' , 
  the [ muppet ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amtovymcxz0 ) version is cool too . 
  the farce is strong with you . 
  well they were forced in the euro by the french so we ca n't `` impose '' obligations on them and even if a federal state can make some sense it mean in practical terms transferring something between 10-30 % of german gdp this is not possible in this universe . 
  there will be europe even after the euro if we like each other we will get closer . 
  yes it is a strange thing halfway between arab greek and french : [ sicilian language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicilian_language ) . 
  the problem is that this never ending crisis is producing desperate people and desperate people vote stupid things . 
  look at greece just five years ago it was a normal society and now they have a openly neonazi party that keep rising . 
  italy i 'm afraid is only some year behind but on the same trajectory . 
  no my friend this time we are working on a different plan . 
  it is a genius plan , it involve taking italian political class load them on c-130 and paradrop them on brussels . 
  after 2 weeks the target is going to have high unemployment , inflation , high debt , crumbling infrastructure , general decadence . 
  of course no . 
  war is good only in films . 
  a little bit more austerity and deflation and we are going to wake up with the [ puppet ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vf_guvpvuu ) on the balcony . 
  oh sorry , street fighting/rioting . 
  ** edit ** guerrilla-guerilla is in fact correct [ english ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/guerrilla ) . 
  well more like a spanishism but whatever . 
  they are protesting against unemployment , taxation and obviously austerity . 
  public worker 's wages were not inflation adjusted from 2009 and the government removed some benefit too , so basically yes wage cut . 
  it happened in other cities too . 
  only in turin there was ~ ~ guerilla ~ ~ street fighting/rioting . 
  you can find other cool videos and pics here [ https://www.facebook.com/pages/the-revolt-of-9th-december-2013-in-italy-international-page/288987307824575] ( https://www.facebook.com/pages/the-revolt-of-9th-december-2013-in-italy-international-page/288987307824575 ), 
  i 'm in fact in favor of united state of europe but real world politics suggest that this is never going to happen so i revert to the second best option : back to the lira . 
   more than it already has ? 
  at the moment they have done exactly zero . 
  what can they do ? 
  a [ new deal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_deal ) on a european scale would be a good start . 
  not `` liberal '' in the american sense , it is more like liberist in the sense it is in favor of freemarket , lean state etc etc. 
  it is basically an undercover thatcher infiltrated in the left camp . 
  the day he try to do half of the things he want to do he will be erased from the page of history . 
  a ) youth unemployment ; b ) top down paternalistic approach ; for better explanation see [ llanita 's comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1sgdtv/why_do_you_think_the_eu_has_such_an_image_problem/cdxck15 ), 
  if we vote tomorrow maybe but if we vote later a center-right grand coalition of `` let 's exit the eurozone '' is going to win . 
  the ability to `` see the books '' and taking the decision to let a bank fail . 
  germany want this to remain national prerogative . 
  oh god !, 
  trucidator what happened to your flag ? 
   if the eurozone adopts the program outlined above , there should be no need for germany to pick up any tab . 
  but under the perverse policies that europe has adopted , one debt restructuring has been followed by another . 
  if germany and the other northern european countries continue to insist on pursuing current policies , they , together with their southern neighbors , will wind up paying a high price . 
   the euro was supposed to bring growth , prosperity , and a sense of unity to europe . 
  instead , it has brought stagnation , instability , and divisiveness . 
   it does not have to be this way . 
  the euro can be saved , but it will take more than fine speeches asserting a commitment to europe . 
  if germany and others are not willing to do what it takes -- if there is not enough solidarity to make the politics work -- then the euro may have to be abandoned for the sake of salvaging the european project . 
  actually we eat polenta in the south too because it is good , 
  every italian that have studied history should know of slovenia , i mean we fought wwi because french fooled us into believing we will be `` rewarded '' with slovenia for this . 
  see [ italian irredentism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_irredentism ), 
  you ~ ~ northem ~ ~ northern polenta eater !, 
  [ pre 1861 ] ( http://pages.uoregon.edu/kimball/images/1861.itl.unified-cwa168.jpg ), 
  yes quebe is right . 
  to make sense of italy you should use a [ pre 1861 map ] ( http://pages.uoregon.edu/kimball/images/1861.itl.unified-cwa168.jpg ) , then everything becomes clear . 
  i see . 
   the younger entente of france and britain will take the lead again what is he talking about ?
