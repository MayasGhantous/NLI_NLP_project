  interesting . 
  massive emigration . 
  my feeling was this but i have only a basic knowledge of english . 
  oh sorry i messed with the stereotype hihihi, 
  hihihhi when it comes to `` soccer '' as you call it we 're pretty good . 
  you are right i live in sicily . 
  of course you were devaluing and printing during the same period so monetary expansion was offsetting fiscal contraction , in idiotic eurozone we were doing contraction on both side ( fiscal and monetary ) . 
  this is interesting because you can see clearly when the idiotic austerity started in europe : 2011 . 
  a true europhile should print that on paper and go saying it around athens periphery , if he survive he will be awarded the european [ purple heart ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/purple_heart ) medal by some random euro puppet in chief . 
  they are playing with fire . 
  the climate in italy is already very tense and when social cohesion finally break we are going to do [ stupid things ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_italy#fascist_regime_.281922.e2.80.931943.29 ) we have done in the past . 
  with all due respect we are not poor little greece when we go down all hell will breaks loose . 
   this is not pushed directly by the commission or the like my fault , the quality of the work fooled me . 
  at the moment there is no eu-state to remain under after they break free so encouraging this is stupid . 
  balkanization is a classic geopolitical trick pulled from great powers . 
  we already have no voice on important decision as nation state , we do n't need more fragmentation . 
  [ divide et impera ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/divide_and_rule ), 
  ahhaha at the moment italy and greece are like thelma and louise in the [ end of the film ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z88u915uq8 ) . 
  but we 'll be back , you ca n't stop the mighty pasta empire !, 
  you are supposed to open the parachute before you hit the ground not after . 
  but try to explain that to hard-money camp . 
  yep euro-zone . 
  no it is not ** europe ** , it is the `` hard money '' ( germany , netherlands , austria , finland ) camp of ~ ~ europe ~ ~ euro-zone that is `` repeating all the errors of japan as deflation draws closer '' . 
  but they have their reason to go this way the million dollar question is what are spain , portugal , ireland , greece and of course italy doing in this currency area ? 
  even under the gold standard exchange rate adjustment were possible but in the euro zone it is impossible !, 
  resistence is futile you will be assimilated by $ ussr too . 
  by the way sweden can you please distract germany while we work on our genius [ plan ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksckyp2mmho ) to escape the eurozone ? 
  if our fundamentals were not sound , if we were so unproductive and lazy and corrupt why we were allowed in the euro ? 
  why so much money was lent to us ? 
  you know what predatory lending is ? 
  you know what frenkel cycle is ? 
  and by the way in the eurozone we are going tu full default , out of the euro maybe we can repay some part of the debt thanks to export . 
  we are only preparing the paper work the ultimate decision to end the eurozone will be berlin or washington based . 
  we are preparing the legal ground to decline the previous 8 years of european legislation . 
  the euro-nightmare is nearing its end . 
  inflation and devaluation are for losers we in mitteleuropa will deflate and austerize till the bitter end like real man do . 
  and by the way we have a tiny cute [ aircraft ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_aircraft_carrier_cavour_%28550%29 ) carrier and treat libya and albania as italian regions so in a sense we are ( try to be ) ` neocolonialist ' . 
  yes organized crime and italian state live in a condition of symbiosis . 
  i will be downvoted for saying this but it is the truth . 
  they envy your welfare bacuse it is the demonstration that ( sometimes ) kenyes work . 
  dear france do n't listen to the liberist you are cool . 
  germany too is divided in the east west axis . 
  if you take the most productive part of a nation and let it break free its new hypothetical currency appreciate cancelling the productivity advantage . 
  the first rule of the fightclub is that `` poland can not into space '' . 
  god save the queen !, 
  it is a mixture of ( unjustified imho ) inferiority complex and chronic misgovernment . 
  italy is very inhomogeneous , spatially and politically fragmented . 
  during the cold-war our position was pivotal , our ability at double gaming and diplomacy gave us a lot of `` free lunch '' . 
  now we live in a different word . 
  but you should not underestimate italy 's economy : the ability of our industry to survive and stay strong despite our political class , the lack of good infrastructure , having the wrong currency and the organized crime is a testament to italian genius . 
  a proud finnish : austerity ? 
  ahahha and you call this problem ? 
  we [ stopped ] ( http://youtu.be/1qd5rokfgqo?t=1m40s ) the soviet between breakfast and lunch and you call this problem ? 
  at this pace i think it is another year of ~ ~ massacre ~ ~ austerity, 
  no i 'm from the south , but i 'm going to x-post to r/italy so you can ( hopefully ) get a northem opinion . 
  in italy ( south part ) we drink a glass of wine with meals especially during winter , beer is preferred during summer . 
  we are not heavy drinkers and we do n't like binge drinking . 
  we have a cult of coffee but this is another story . 
  keep in mind that italy is deeply divided in the north south axis , north feel like mitteleuropa south feel like middle-east . 
  so it is possible that a north italian come here and describe something completely different . 
  yes this is true , they ( the french ) thought they would be able to control ecb and `` frenchesize '' german economy . 
  epic mistake it was [ said with yoda tone ] . 
  indeed . 
  unfortunately italy always had a secret love for germany and our political ruling class was ( and is ) full of germanophile euro-dreamer like [ romano prodi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romano_prodi ) ( italian codename `` er mortadella '' loosely translated `` mr. ham '' ) and so we are going full steam ahead against the iceberg singing [ `` deutschland \u00fcber alles in der welt !, 
  '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vebyql8nusw ) . 
  eurozone resemble a last man standing game . 
  ** edit ** and the last man wear sandals with socks . 
  but even survival is a heroical mission at the moment . 
  just wait for jan 2015 when italy is supposed to find 60 billion $ / year for fiscal compact . 
  we already are pre-revolutionary after trying to balance the budget . 
  your analogy is better but the end result would be the same : `` murrika '' `` exporting freedom '' to messico . 
  yes eu is playing a risky game . 
  we should not mess with russia 's buffer states . 
  i mean imagine russia asking messico to join [ sco ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shanghai_cooperation_organisation ) `` murrika '' would be a little upset ... 
   [ god save the queen ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn9ec3gy6nk ) , [ fratelli d'italia ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3rtobymtta ), 
  [ `` being there '' 1979 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/being_there ) with peter sellers . 
  it is a mix of comedy and philosophy , `` something '' in this film is truly epiphanic . 
  first and last . 
  fact is fixed exhange rate impose internal devaluation and this lead to loss of internal demand . 
  of course if you are only interested in exporting no problem but can an economy be 100 % export based ? 
  i hope finland is able to `` adjust '' , italy will just take the sud-american way out of this . 
  interesting article . 
  of course i do n't think that having an exchange rate is a silver bullet , and it is pretty evident that italy has a lot of other problems . 
  but being locked in an overvalued currency is going to be the proverbial nail in the coffin of italy 's export industry . 
  i think the joke was about `` murricans '' not knowing other nations flags and geography . 
  i was laughing about that not about being from ireland which by the way i think is [ cool ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dublin ) . 
  poland succes story only demonstrate that having an [ exchange rate ] ( http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/08/01/poland_s_currency_devaluation_is_evidence_that_monetary_expansion_works.html ) is crucial during time of crisis . 
  but this comment will be downvoted because euro-dreamer prefer fantasy to economic reality . 
  will you listen to [ olivier blanchard ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivier_blanchard ) ? 
  ( imf chief economist )  finally , turning to capital flows . 
  in emerging markets ( and , more generally , in small advanced economies , although these were not explicitly covered at the conference ) , the evidence suggests ** the best way to deal with volatile capital flows is by letting the exchange rate absorb most ** -- but not necessarily all -- of the adjustment . 
  the standard argument in favor of letting the exchange rate adjust was stated by paul krugman at the conference . 
  if investors want to take their funds out , let them : the exchange rate will depreciate , and this will lead , if anything , to an increase in exports and an increase in output . 
  [ monetary policy will never be the same ] ( http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2013/11/19/monetary-policy-will-never-be-the-same/ ) ** edit ** will you listen to the economist ? 
  then read this interesting [ article ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/21560865 ) comparing finland and sweden . 
   unlike finland , sweden chose not to join the euro . 
  until the crisis , that made little difference . 
  both countries did well ; if anything finland 's performance was stronger . 
  but over the past five years their fortunes have diverged to the detriment of finland ( see chart ) . 
  the finns suffered a much sharper recession than the swedes , and finland 's recovery has been less ebullient .
