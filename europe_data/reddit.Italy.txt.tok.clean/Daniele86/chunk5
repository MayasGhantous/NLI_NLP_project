  moreover , the finnish economy has stumbled of late : gdp fell by 1 % in the second quarter in finland , whereas it rose by 1.4 % in sweden . 
  ** bonus ** [ pln/eur exchange rate 2008-2011 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/e53khn0.png?1 ) you can play with the chart [ here ] ( http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/exchange/eurofxref/html/eurofxref-graph-pln.en.html ), 
  every time i read of eu-wide numbers this old joke comes to my mind :  a statistician can have his head in an oven and his feet in ice , and he will say that on average , he feels fine . 
  even in a fragmentation scenario cooperation minimize losses for everyone . 
  no rational person on earth want to see italy go full argentina . 
  if fiscal transfers are not feasible and they are obviously not feasible the only solution is a coordinated return to local currencies with equal sharing of the losses . 
  if someone try do something stupid we risk a nuclear winter and everybody know that . 
  dear `` murrika '' we want to denounce domestic violence by germany , we are planning to exit eurozone can you offer political asylum in [ nafta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_free_trade_agreement ) ? 
   given the strains within the euro zone , a fiscal crisis of some sort is considered highly likely , especially in countries with higher debt burdens like italy or spain . 
  under the fund 's proposal , the next time a country has trouble tapping debt markets , it would be given a brief period to resolve its problems . 
  during this so-called standstill -- and here is the rub -- private sector creditors would be forced to hold on to their bonds ( and take a loss ) , as opposed to just dumping them . 
  this is a gentle way to say italy is going to default and you are going to lose both on public debt and target2 . 
  i can already see the panzer divisions lined up on the border , the good news is that we are going to have a free for all german course hihihihhi, 
  like the t-1000 from terminator 2 he is able assume [ other form ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/silvio-berlusconi/10143897/silvio-berlusconi-planning-to-hand-power-to-daughter-marina.html ) . 
  i [ know ] ( http://raceagainstthemachine.com/ ) . 
  more of the same . 
   in every society , manufacturing builds the lower middle class . 
  if you give up manufacturing , you end up with haves and have-nots and you get social polarization . 
  the whole lower middle class sinks . 
  no , this is how i indicate that i 'm laughing . 
  i 'm not the ambassador of italy on reddit . 
  they had a plan to [ join europe ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1563692/soviet-plan-for-ww3-nuclear-attack-unearthed.html ) and they almost used it around [ 1983 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanislav_petrov ) hihihi, 
  fabra is strong but i 'm afraid our national [ champion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trials_and_allegations_involving_silvio_berlusconi ) is superior . 
   who is responsible for what in europe it 's easy : [ mutti ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angela_merkel ) is the good cop , the [ buba ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsche_bundesbank ) is the bad cop . 
  this is a wonderful country :d, 
   there 's an unspoken rule in danish society about privacy and the public sphere . 
  danes believe that everyone has the right not to be bothered in public , and that they should be able to go about their business free of awkward exchanges , unsolicited greetings , or general inconveniences created by others . 
  what comes to [ mind ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgpgngjp7pe ) reading this article . 
   meine frau isst auch pasta mit ketchup und parmesan this is the level of german i 'm able to understand , too bad real world german is a [ nightmare ] ( http://youtu.be/ivbqqr_wcea?t=1m4s ) . 
   well italians really are anal and pretentious about pasta considering that most pasta is made following the same exact recipe and just made into different shapes . 
  yes and the legendary [ porsche 959 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porsche_959 ) is just a piece of metal with a particular shape like a hyundai atos you know . 
  let 's make a practical example : `` eurozone is a paternalistic and elitist project , it is in my humble opinion doomed to fail '' start the down voting !, 
  i agree . 
  ambassadors are delivering the declaration of war . 
  and no amount of funny [ talking ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=covcpjgjaie ) churchill is going to save you this time . 
  may [ god of pasta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flying_spaghetti_monster ) have mercy on your soul . 
  the force is strong with you . 
  [ i hug you ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhgqhnwzmxo ) . 
  yes , your people built a lot of cool [ temples here ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=sicily+greek+temples ) . 
  sorry for the cheap shot , by the way i do n't think russia is really interested in joining the eu . 
  i 'm not surprised , we are [ literally ] ( http://dienekes.blogspot.it/2008/08/sicilian-y-chromosomes-greek-and-north.html ) blood brothers . 
   the genetic contribution of greek chromosomes to the sicilian gene pool is estimated to be about 37 % whereas the contribution of north african populations is estimated to be around 6 % . 
  last time we tried this [ love affair ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molotov%e2%80%93ribbentrop_pact ) it ended very well ... 
   ketchup on pasta . 
  this really shocks italians . 
  barilla calls it `` a true culinary sin '' . 
  [ noooooooooooooooooooooooooo !!!, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwalxfivx1s ), 
  dear france we need to talk about the eurozone ... 
  of course i 've seen it . 
  it is a classic . 
  as an italian i can not grasp even at a conceptual level the term `` frozen pasta '' , it is a total heresy . 
  i feel [ sad ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfxqzaghxbm ) . 
   frozen meals wait a minute , frozen pre-cooked pasta ? 
  not in this universe !, 
  a true italian always cook his pasta . 
  i have never eaten pre-cooked pasta in my all life . 
   * complete with accompanying hand motions this is common in the south part of italy . 
  no stereotype at all . 
  i do n't get why he keep repeating `` bertolli '' ( the brand name ) but this is a realistic scenario . 
  i 'm afraid it is a pretty realistic scenario , maybe it is not plump but hihihi ** edit ** frozen pasta is prohibited by the laws of thermodynamics and it is a crime against humanity . 
  if someone can link me the incriminated commercial i can try to estimate stereotype/truth ratio . 
  leaving aside all the political chess game the situation in the end is quite simple : if the eu is able to bring prosperity and dignity to ** all ** partecipating nations and citizens then it will endure the test of time otherwise it will self-destruct . 
  we need to hope for an `` illuministic shock '' both from the north and south elite . 
  but i remain sceptical . 
  so us will finally start to eat real italian [ pasta ] ( http://www.barilla.com/ ) . 
  i propose [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qz7e3stzsu ) as official soundtrack of this tragicomic story . 
  i know , there are various good technical solution to eurozone problems . 
  but we lack the political will to do anything both from the north and from the south side . 
  cheap loans ? 
  at the moment draghi is buying all of our debt we do n't need cheap loans at all . 
  we have one year before fiscal compact jan 2015 ( -60 billion euro/year ) . 
  we will never comply with it . 
  we are buying back our debt . 
  social tensions are rising . 
  the only real pro-euro party pd is going to fragment after renzi win this december . 
  there will be no political decision , things will happen . 
  like there was no political decision or referendum in argentina , first the corralito and then unpegging and default . 
  when it finally happen you are going to have a lot of material on google news hihhihi, 
  i 'm only quoting the article , and by the way italy is going to exit the eurozone this year or the next . 
   the eu did not bring europeans more democracy and freedom , either . 
  on the contrary : the eu is a prison of nations . 
  it undermines our national democracies . 
  it resembles an eussr . 
  nobody cares of your gdp when you are thermonuclear and able to [ strategically ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intercontinental_ballistic_missile ) deliver it . 
  of course having a [ big ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=russia ) and bad army help too . 
  good news . 
  yes but you forgot that germany lost the war and was unable to `` unificate '' europe . 
  today there is no common enemy in fact `` europe '' has 3 to 4 different foreign policy . 
  shoot the messenger !, 
  upvote for having studied history . 
  paternalistic and reactionary is the nature of the eurozone project . 
  to create a state you need a common enemy and a bloody civil war , we lack both . 
  we should use the vegetarian nordic army to fight back !, 
  nobody expect the viking in the mediterranean sea . 
  eurozone is like a malformed usa where evreyone do what the state of ny decide and there is no federal welfare or fiscal tranfer . 
  this is obvioulsy going to end one way or another . 
  with the economic context we have in italy your friend was naive to say the least . 
  may i ask what part of italy ? 
  in italy or in germany ?
