  well the european unification exercise was tried a lot of times in the past and it always failed . 
  `` italy '' [ tried ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_empire ) , france [ tried ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/napoleon ) and of course germany [ tried ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii ) . 
  it is called [ cognitive dissonance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cognitive_dissonance ) . 
  italian pm calling for `` more europe '' is like the titanic captain calling for `` more iceberg '' . 
  behind germany 's export success is an outsize global sales-promotion network that is helping to boost a trade surplus that has become a source of friction with its european and u.s. allies . 
  the country 's already large surplus in trade and investment income rose by almost 18 % in september compared with a year earlier -- as new data showed the balances posted by other euro-zone countries weakened slightly . 
  the european central bank said monday that the current-account surplus of the 17-country euro zone grew less than 4 % to $ 13.7 billion ( $ 18.5 billion ) in september -- which was less than germany 's surplus alone of $ 20 billion . 
  the current account is the broadest measure of trade and investment income . 
  enlarge image such figures have put germany on the spot for boosting its economy through foreign sales rather than domestic consumption . 
  the u.s. treasury last month said germany 's export-focused approach , without a similar effort to lift domestic demand , hampered europe 's recovery from its financial crisis , which in turn dragged on the world economy . 
  the eu last week announced it would assess whether germany 's trade balance has breached economic targets for the 28-country bloc . 
  yet there is one , sometimes underestimated , reason for germany 's export success : a low-profile but sophisticated global network of representatives built over decades to establish an export footprint for even the smallest german companies . 
  the german chambers of commerce abroad has 120 offices in 80 countries , with more than 1,700 staff to promote german commercial interests . 
  `` i do n't think it 's germany 's fault '' that the country runs an export surplus , said emma marcegaglia , an italian entrepreneur and president of business europe , a 35-country lobbying group . 
  `` the real difference is their system . '', 
  the system links the overseas commercial chambers to 80 regional chambers around germany and relies on funds from both companies and the government . 
  entrepreneurs say this breadth and integration make a particularly big difference for germany 's hundreds of thousands of small and midsize companies , many of them family-owned , known as the mittelstand . 
  they are companies such as fl\u00f6sser gmbh , a 12-person supplier of car lights and horns based in trier , two hours from the nearest airport . 
  when owner hans otto fl\u00f6sser decided last year to export to vietnam , the distant alien market was n't especially daunting . 
  mr. fl\u00f6sser , who already exported to roughly 100 countries , tapped the german-vietnam chamber of commerce 's office in ho chi minh city . 
  for a modest fee , he said , the office conducted market surveys , found potential distributors and contacted several of them . 
  when mr. fl\u00f6sser flew over to meet candidates , the chamber scheduled visits , hired translators and even arranged a car and driver . 
  after just a few days , mr. fl\u00f6sser signed up a distributor . 
  his first shipment more than paid for the chamber 's fees , he said . 
  `` i think it would have been very difficult for us as foreigners to go to vietnam '' without the help , he said . 
  fl\u00f6sser 's experience is typical , german executives say . 
  officials at the international chambers say they help roughly 50,000 business people annually . 
  no western country comes close in supporting small companies overseas . 
  some asian countries , including taiwan and south korea , offer comparable support , export specialists say . 
  `` it 's incredible how strong the germans are abroad , '' said arnaldo abruzzini , an italian business owner and secretary-general of eurochambres , a lobbying group for small business in brussels . 
  related no easing of this ecb headache compounding the impact of germany 's strong export network is the competitiveness of the country 's high-end , niche manufacturing industries and its culture of saving over spending . 
  the combination yields the massive trade surpluses that have drawn criticism . 
  but germany is n't pursuing a beggar-thy-neighbor approach to its euro-zone peers , says andreas rees , economist at unicredit . 
  ucg.mi -0.19 % germany 's trade surplus with the rest of the euro zone has declined from 5 % of gdp before the 2008 financial crisis to just 2 % now . 
  its trade surplus is being generated outside europe , where the export network kicks in . 
  for instance , germany has largely eliminated a 1.5 % - of-gdp trade deficit with china in recent years . 
  `` instead of complaining and pointing the finger to china , german companies made the best of this , '' mr. rees said . 
  `` it was more about gaining a foothold in china . '', 
  between the first quarter of 2008 and the middle of this year , german exports to the rest of the euro zone fell 7 % . 
  they more than doubled to indonesia and china and rose significantly to south korea , brazil and the middle east . 
  since the financial crisis hit in 2008 , officials in countries including the u.s. and britain have analyzed germany 's export model to help boost their own foreign sales , particularly from small companies . 
  president barack obama in 2010 launched the national export initiative , pledging to double exports by 2015 . 
  while foreign sales have risen , the country is more than $ 200 billion below target , according to the brookings institution . 
  a big reason is that although u.s. corporations are increasingly global , small and midsize u.s. companies are n't as inclined to look abroad , export specialists say . 
  american entrepreneurs have long preferred to expand domestically rather than overseas . 
  u.s. chambers of commerce tend to focus on large companies , foreign-trade veterans say , and government export-promotion efforts have n't been user-friendly to small businesses . 
  washington has 19 different offices handling aspects of exporting , according to one government assessment . 
  `` the u.s. does n't have an export culture , '' said brad mcdearman , director of a project at the brookings institution to help american exporters at the municipal level . 
  the effort aims to learn from experiences of small companies and help them compete overseas more like german companies . 
  we lack a common foreign policy but now we have a common drone . 
  good . 
  [ it 's a trap !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f4qzpbcfial ), 
  of course , they sail from the dawn of time !, 
  a lot of italians go there for the super cheap dentist . 
  to `` enjoy '' democracy you must first be able to eat and live . 
  dismissing golden dawn as protest vote or folklore is exactly the same political mistake that was made in italy in 1920 and in germany in 1930 . 
  many unemployed people are ready to trade democracy for a job . 
  this is a very dangerous situation . 
  they are creating and unleashing a monster ( nationalism in its dangerous form ) they will be unable to control in the end . 
  we should end the eurozone before it ends democracy . 
  take this dose of euro-democracy !, 
  $ . u.s.s.r : nixon was by comparison a pacifist, 
  germany is keynesian with other nations deficit . 
  yes our institutions are a little bit [ reactionary ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancien_r%c3%a9gime ) .

  interesting , some time ago i was playing chess online with a romanian and he was able to understand italian without having studied it . 
  and he explained to me the same thing you are saying . 
  frater ( latin ) -  frate ( romanian ) -  fratello ( italian ) . 
  in italy we have so many dialect and most of these are completely different language . 
  the first thing you say i can agree with . 
  you should change your flag . 
  i 'm reading it at the moment , 
  yeah this is a very sad story . 
  i think the indians want money and a lot of it . 
  are we talking about europe or italy ? 
  they are trying but they will fail like they always fail . 
  they lack the tolerance and pragmatism needed to lead a multinational empire . 
  they should ask great brtitain or the good old ottoman empire how to do it . 
  as i 've already said in r/economics people should remember ** when ** and ** why ** keynes wrote what he wrote . 
  please inform brussels that ( in italy ) the only last really pro euro party , the center left `` democratic party '' pd , is rapidly losing faith in eu . 
  so prepare for surprise bank holiday . 
  in a currency area surplus and deficit are equally troubling because we cant ' revalue or devalue . 
  and they downvote you for saying the truth . 
  ukraine [ must into eu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_geographical_pivot_of_history#strategic_importance_of_eastern_europe ) says mackinder . 
   later , in 1919 , mackinder summarised his theory as : `` who rules east europe commands the heartland ; who rules the heartland commands the world-island ; who rules the world-island controls the world . '', 
  ( mackinder , democratic ideals and reality , p. 106 ), 
  well culturally we are winning on all the line . 
  and geopolitically too we are not losing at all . 
  i can almost read romanian !, 
  well because it is almost italian . 
  these lazy europeans want your money !, 
  quick go back to dmark !, 
  and then they ask why i say `` 1910 politic '' . 
  but the nothem version of the euro propaganda is `` we are saving lazy southerner with our hard earned money '' . 
  dear northem taxpayers you are bailing out your big banks : deutsche bank and bnp .
