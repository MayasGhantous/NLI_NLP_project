  you are on the target2 debt bomb like [ major kong ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlsqazep3pa ) and you think you can dictate condition . 
  if you are serious just stop draghi 's bond buying and let 's see the real paper tiger `` engine of europe '' . 
  france you should not date us girlfriend i can already hear the claim that there are chemical weapons in the tour eiffel hihihih, 
  [ tarkovskij ] ( http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrej_arsen%27evi%c4%8d_tarkovskij ) 's film are [ poetic ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qpgl6ndequ ) . 
  too much [ ratm ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3itf4horzry ) or [ propagandhi ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4dorkdtwkq ) listening may have side effects . 
  buy nationalism !, 
  now with official [ ratm soundtrack ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqkmsxchqyg ), 
  this is good news, 
  the only other option is that they were completely dumb , they have not read 1960 mundell work on oca and mundell-fleming model etc etc. 
  but this is first year economics i do n't want to believe that . 
  [ waiting for the verb ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/german/comedy/waiting_for_verb.shtml ), 
  i know no german but i know of the suspense of `` waiting for the nicht '' explained to me by my brother in law ( he is a translator ) . 
  italy need 5 % inflation and 0.7 $ / $ at the moment we have almost 0 % inflation and 1.3 $ / $ . 
  we are unable to devalue , supposed `` internal devaluation '' will take decades to work . 
  and we have a massive debt so there are really two solution : 1 ) euro-exit and devaluation ( and implicit default ) 2 ) massive default with fiscal transfer from the north . 
  i 'm not a delusional right wing populist , this is the situation what are we going to do ? 
  well congratulation italian is a hard to learn language . 
  in italy all regions are equally represented in europe all nations are n't . 
  without ecb intervention we are out of the eurozone in one week this is no secret from summer 2011 but again there is a politial will . 
  just explain it clearly to northem taxpayers , they are not funding `` lazy southerner '' they are funding the `` will of power '' of the new rising superstate . 
  if you are paywalled go there from google https://www.google.com/search?q=why+draghi+was+wrong+to+cut+interest+rates, 
  so you think eurozone is an optimal currency area ? 
  are you italian ? 
  downplaying deflation risk = newspeak, 
  so they were incompetent ? 
  i mean there was a lot of material and study around optimal area currency already but they made the euro as it is . 
  of course incopetent they were not , they were political . 
  well newton was right a long time ago and is still right . 
   we are all middle class you ** were ** all middleclass . 
  surrender to the new feudalistic [ technotopia ] ( http://raceagainstthemachine.com/ ) . 
  the funny thing is that the more freemarket we go the more they start saying that marx was right . 
  but they say it [ quietly ] ( http://dailyreckoning.com/real-us-economy-trampled-by-white-elephants/ ) . 
   so it would seem to me that karl marx might prove to have been right in his contention that crises become more and more destructive as the capitalistic system matures ( and as the `` financial economy '' referred to earlier grows like a cancer ) and that the ultimate breakdown will occur in a final crisis that will be so disastrous as to set fire to the framework of our capitalistic society . 
  in ( devalued ) lira we trust . 
  1984 's [ newspeak ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/newspeak ), 
  time for [ bancor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bancor ) and [ international clearing union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_clearing_union ) . 
  german is harder to learn . 
  deflate all the things !, 
  economically speaking very bad but we are very adaptable , we survived so many different empire and [ domination ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicily#history ) that i 'm confident that we 'll see the sunset of the merkelian empire too . 
  dear germans please do n't take this comment too seriously . 
  i know everything you said my friend i was n't trying to do a technical comment , i was just trying to say look we are in deep schei\u00dfe here . 
  in italy price of everything is going down especially in the south . 
  but if you have no income you ca n't `` enjoy '' it . 
  and you call this a recession ? 
  in sicily we managed a good -11 % in two years , we are almost outrunning our proud greek brothers . 
  i spotted a marxist , quick call the euro-police !, 
  italy can not into relevance . 
  [ man turns into scotsman ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxdjmn-534y ), 
  the currency union was deliberately ill designed . 
  at the first serious shock all economies diverged in this typical core-periphery dynamic . 
  the public debt problem is orthogonal to the currency problem . 
  now we have mass unemployment and no amount of euro-propaganda will be able to stop the rise of the old nationalist . 
  there can be no union when in italy we have 40 % ( and rising ) youth unemployment and in austria they have 5 % . 
  at the moment is the german imposed austerity that is annihilating us not the atlantic bulling . 
  the decision to build an asymmetric union was deliberate not an incident . 
  the diplomatic game is the same . 
  if france get closer to germany italy get closer to russia and gb and viceversa . 
  if germany try to get closer to russia then italy france and gb will rediscover their reciprocal love . 
  i understand the `` clash of the titans '' argument but if this is the union we are going to build in which italy lose on every aspect i prefer the old master . 
  and by the way our pm can be germanophile as much as he want but we are and remain in us sphere of influence . 
  maybe in the next years they will `` free '' us again this time with the help of finance no need of b-52 . 
  good guy eu , everyday more orwellian . 
  maybe by the 2050 united state of europe will be politically feasible . 
  at the moment we have a `` everyone for himself '' . 
  this is why i 'm very sceptical and i openly advocate for going back to national sovereignty . 
  europe was a byproduct of the coldwar . 
  it was supposed to be the politcal counterpart of nato in europe . 
  now without `` red scare '' and after germany reunification we are back to 1910 politic . 
  north is losing money and south is losing job , what could be done ? 
  trash it . 
  interesting , i always had this feeling of a strange double standard . 
  i 'm not pro nor against any particular economic model but if we are trying to build the superstate we are going to need a massive dose of pragmatism and common sense . 
  trying plainly and simply to make the eu a mega-germany is stupid and doomed to end in tragedy . 
  if this is the `` left '' in germany what is the right going to propose gold-standard ? 
  crush the pensioner we must conquer export !, 
  take germany they talk a lot of freemarket privatisation and public debt = bad for everybody else but they are basically an enormous dirigism experiment , the state control everything and their bureaucracy is legendary . 
  they are von hayekian in the talk and keynesian in the action . 
  the state keep rent prices down so that companies can pay worker less , this is managed economy . 
  they subsidize energy cost of the big companies again what is this ? 
   greeks and italians are loving being dictated to by the northern european states ( what 's happening now ) . 
  as an italian i beg to [ differ ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_unification#third_war_of_independence_.281866.29 ) . 
  i know you were sarcastic but just to clarify . 
  i envy you , we need an italian mrs. 
  le pen . 
  as a left-wing i hope she get elected so we can dismantle the eurozone . 
  they ca n't because it 's a totally ideological debate , this like the other debate big-state vs lean-state . 
  making a meeting just to decide where to make another meeting in an italian art but they mastered it . 
  you are being uber-naive . 
  so in the real word people get killed with polonium , polish prime minister plane get shotdown and you think germany is not able to put a greek prime minister out of the office ? 
  but then they can say `` look the austerity is working the unemployment is going down '' like in the baltic republic . 
  there are already so many italians in london that i can go there without speaking a single word of english . 
  ahahaha and then why when papandreou proposed the referendum was out of the office in 60 second ? 
  kafkian, 
  it is the same paternalistic end elitist ideology , `` they know best '' for the people . 
  the fact you do n't see t-72 in the street does n't mean we are in democracy . 
  ** edit ** go ask a greek what he think of the ez , they are being annihilated because they are n't allowed to default because some core bank has a lot of debt off-balance sheet . 
  [ kraftwerk - autobahn ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e11h73whqk4 ), 
  and then they ( hopefully ) go back to dmark . 
  i 'm sure i meant [ this ] ( http://moonofthesouth.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/eurozone-pic.jpg ) idiotic and undemocratic currency area is starting to look a lot like [ that ] ( http://vu.ua/uploadfiles/fckeditor/image/ussr/ussr_map.jpg ) other failed empire .
