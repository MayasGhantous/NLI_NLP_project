  is very democratic you know ... 
  relax germany eurozone is going to self-destruct like the [ ems ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_monetary_system ) , you just need to be patient . 
  an external shock made the economies ( core vs periphery ) diverge this exactly the mundell-flaming model prediction . 
  so the model is ( and was ) right and so the euro currency area is not an oca . 
  but you are blindfolded by ideology i guess . 
  i can for sure say that ( in italy ) there is a strong academic debate on euro-exit and that in the next month thanks to the looming political crisis the debate will go mainstream . 
  i know italy and in italy we went from all-fascist to all-antifascist in one night so ... 
  ahahahaah this sounds a lot like italy, 
  the more the crisis stregthen the more core and periphery diverge this is by definition an unstable system . 
  germany stance is becoming more and more hawkish not dovish . 
   this is the only possible ending my friend this is my opinion , but i know history and i know this is not your everydary recession . 
  just wait 1-2 years . 
  so they do n't like transfer between l\u00e4nder and are going to like transfer between nation ? 
  have you actually talked with a german ? 
  after a decade of propaganda on both side the endgame is going to be uncooperative . 
  you are illuministic in your approach . 
  [  the four often cited criteria for a successful currency union are  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/optimum_currency_area ) * labor mobility across the region . 
  this includes physical ability to travel ( visas , workers ' rights , etc. 
  ) , lack of cultural barriers to free movement ( such as different languages ) and institutional arrangements ( such as the ability to have superannuation transferred throughout the region ) ( robert a. mundell ) . 
  * openness with capital mobility and price and wage flexibility across the region . 
  this is so that the market forces of supply and demand automatically distribute money and goods to where they are needed . 
  in practice this does not work perfectly as there is no true wage flexibility . 
  the eurozone members trade heavily with each other ( intra-european trade is greater than international trade ) , and most recent empirical analyses of the ` euro effect ' suggest that the single currency has increased trade by 5 to 15 percent in the euro-zone when compared to trade between non-euro countries . 
  [ 7 ] * a risk sharing system such as an automatic fiscal transfer mechanism to redistribute money to areas/sectors which have been adversely affected by the first two characteristics . 
  this usually takes the form of taxation redistribution to less developed areas of a country/region . 
  this policy , though theoretically accepted , is politically difficult to implement as the better-off regions rarely give up their revenue easily . 
  theoretically , europe has a no-bailout clause in the stability and growth pact , meaning that fiscal transfers are not allowed . 
  during the 2010 european sovereign debt crisis , the no-bailout clause was de facto abandoned in april 2010 . 
  [ 8 ] * participant countries have similar business cycles . 
  when one country experiences a boom or recession , other countries in the union are likely to follow . 
  this allows the shared central bank to promote growth in downturns and to contain inflation in booms . 
  should countries in a currency union have idiosyncratic business cycles , then optimal monetary policy may diverge and union participants may be made worse off under a joint central bank . 
  we just miss 3 out of 4 but no problem go full steam ahead . 
   euro-exit of southern nation is the only solution . 
  with a little bit of [ game theory ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-12/italy-exits-before-greece-in-bofa-game-theory-cutting-research.html ) you can understand that this is the only end game , but i 'm talking for italy which still has 30 % export . 
  maybe spain or portugal want to `` die for maastricht '' . 
  [ another article ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/news/italy-it-game-theory-over ), 
  the point is that blame game is not going to solve anything euro-exit of southern nation is the only solution . 
  every european government is victim of his own propaganda and now it is too late to explain what should be done . 
  germany will never italianize and italy will never germanize not in this universe , so end the euro before euro end europe . 
   yet the problem it defines is the same today as it has always been ; any attempt to set a single interest rate for 17 politically and fiscally sovereign nations is almost by definition doomed to failure . 
  perpetual crisis is more or less guaranteed .

  again with latvia ? 
  their `` solution '' was mass emigration , if someone can tell me were to send 5 million italian unemployed then we 're saved .

  if they stay five years to 4 % ( inflation ) and we stay to 1 % we can recover part of the gap , but if they keep staying at 1 % we need to go negative ( deflation ) and with all the debt we just ca n't afford deflation . 
  but i know history and germany will just keep doing germany so they should be prepared to recapitalize their bank and cover the target2 losses because southern europe is going to chain default and restore their currency . 
  going full [ keynesian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_deal ) would be a good start . 
  accepting 4 % inflation and leaving the ecb free to do his job should help too . 
  99.98 % of italian politician are odd politician . 
  well kaldor said [ that ] ( http://www.concertedaction.com/2012/08/16/nicholas-kaldor-on-the-common-market/ ) in 1971 ( ! ), 
  the main reason of this right-shift is obviously the mass unemployment especially of the young .

  hi finland i know you are cool and i know you single-handedly [ stopped the soviet in wwii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) , i respect you but can you please tell germany to become more pragmatic ( read : keynesian ) before this euro-farce goes in the euro-shitter ?

  an italian comedy/rock band of the seventy called `` skiantos '' made a song to parody idiotic nationalism called `` let 's take back corsica/corse '' .

  x4 take back the corsica !, 
  * outside the padded room * will be more beautiful life * we need just a bit of courage * to hitch a ride * or maybe a free ticket * to board the ferry x4 take back the corsica !, 
  * maybe they do not expect * maybe they do not care * ( we will ) attack from the ports * ( we ) will establish new courses * but if you do not want to have problem * keep your mouth shut x4 take back the corsica !, 
  if it goes wrong ... we will try to invade switzerland .
