  and why you give welfare to non citizen ?

  good old [ mercantilism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercantilism ), 
  yes it is called old school keneys . 
  because the problem is not public debt but overvalued currency . 
  if our central bank goes back to work interst rate on our debt will go to ( almost ) zero , see japan . 
  and greek unemployed are going to eat wi-fi ? 
  not in this universe . 
   what i am trying to say is that you are in a very difficult situation and simply changing the currency to get out of it is not going to work . 
  i know we have a lot of problems and one way or another we are going to pay for this mess but the point is this currency area is not working period . 
  we need to end it in an orderly manner . 
  the sooner the better . 
  devaluing 15-20 % is what we are after . 
  and by the way if your nation like this euro madness why do n't you adopt the euro ? 
  and when we repay in lira and they do n't like liras what are they going to do ? 
  send in the wehrmacht ?

  maybe it 's just foreign bias . 
  everyone who propose to go back to lira .

  someone should explain to german people what target2 is and what is going to happen if this crisis goes nuclear . 
  we need to end this euro-farce before it become an euro-tragedy . 
  of course we reached a turning point , italy is in deflation with a big debtload and it is unable to devalue so this is going to end full argentina . 
  same in italy . 
   the strategy of tension ( italian : strategia della tensione ) is a tactic that aims to divide , manipulate , and control public opinion using fear , propaganda , disinformation , psychological warfare , agents provocateurs , and ** false flag terrorist actions ** . 
  [ wiki : strategy of tension ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strategy_of_tension ), 
  the last 3 month reading for italy when tax stripped where infact negative so i am right to call it a deflationary policy but this is not the point . 
  the point is that europe ( germany ) is making exactly the same mistake that put fascist in charge in italy . 
  and by the way i read something similar is happening in france too with mrs. marine le pen . 
  inflation ? 
  [ http://www.tradingeconomics.com/italy/inflation-cpi] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/italy/inflation-cpi ), 
  first they cause mass unemployment in the south with this deflationary currency area and then they run screaming `` populist !, 
  we are buying back our debt , and they tried to impose limit on cash withdrawal ... 
  i think that in one or two year at max we will euro-exit .

  no , it is a [ constructive debate ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riqhmxbbqwu ) lol, 
   by contrast surplus countries , including germany , the netherlands and austria , enjoy an artificially low exchange rate . 
  were germany still using the deutschmark , its currency would surely appreciate . 
  our labor market is rigid , wages are ( very ) sticky . 
  exactly . 
  no mad max scenario here , no 1970 oilshock . 
  this is your typical deflationary depression . 
  i live in southern italy and i see prices go down , housing , food , just about everything but at the same time we have double digit unemployment so this is in fact 1929 not 1973 or 1979 . 
  every major central bank is printing like there is no tomorrow , usa is going from dovish to uber-dovish but we are waiting for godot and the end result is this 1,38 euro/dollar, 
  being unemployed is an apparent tax . 
  i 'm in fact left-wing but all italian left-wing is sold to this ridiculous euro-theology . 
  euro-exit is a total taboo . 
  there is something orwellian about it . 
  the only nation playing by the rule at the moment is [ france . 
  ] ( http://varoufakis.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/unit-labour-costs-in-germany-and-the-periphery.png ) adjustment must be symmetric , germany need to reflate . 
  our political system is deeply vertically and regionally fragmented for various historical reason . 
  we are not japan we ca n't stand prolonged deflation/unemployment , italians will end up voting some stupid neo-fascist party .

  `` surrender and your life will be spared '' .

  do not worry i 'm from italy and i do not feel offended from an acronym . 
  yes it is . 
  unfortunately in italy there is no political party discussing explicitly about this , it is a taboo . 
  whatever the media says we are experimenting full blown deflation and double digit unemployment here . 
  the patient will be dead long before the internal devaluation takes effect . 
  fact is we ( italy ) need a free floating exchange rate or we will be trapped in a never ending deflation .
