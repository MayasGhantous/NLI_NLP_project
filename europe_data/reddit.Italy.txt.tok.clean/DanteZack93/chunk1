because it does n't work , the only reason why dealing with the migration crisis or the economic crisis has been so hard is that each member state was thinking for itself instead of actually doing something about it . 
  if we had a federal union we could do much more . 
  if there are talks about a unified army or an european finance minister it means we are already going in that direction , so we might as well become the european federal union right away . 
  it really depends how the whole process would work , either way sooner or later the politicians would have to choose between less power or no power and the smart ones would get on the less power train making it even harder for the others to avoid complying with the referendum . 
  not sure how the process of becoming a federation would be , would it be a thing just a day after the referendum ? 
  if so , they would have no power to begin with . 
  would it be a transitional period of a couple years ? 
  then if they do n't do their job they could get fined by the eu which would have federal authority over them . 
  btw if such referendum is won with a qualified majority , i do n't think the population would be quiet and leave the government do as it pleases . 
  so what would you expect them to do ? 
  it 's not like they have any power over the army so how would they stop it ? 
  btw i do n't think politicians losing power will be a problem , you could have said the same thing when we made the european stole and steel community or when we made the eu or pretty much every time we give a bit more power to the eu . 
  the constitution gives the power in the hand of its citizens which than choose some people to work for them . 
  if there is a lawful referendum where a qualified majority votes in favor of a federal union , the politicians would have to accept it since they would not have much choice . 
  it 's not like they have to , the idea of the federation is to put together our resources and improve our union and therefore the countries that make it . 
  we already are a weird kind of almost federation and we surely are more than a simple confederation , there are even talks of an eu military , we have an eu parliament and we have an eu currency . 
  if we become a federation in my opinion most of the current problems would get solved much quicker and effectively . 
  with that said , i do agree that right now it is not the right moment since it probably would require a referendum in each member state and there is no way that the european federal union would win . 
  it 's not like the uk cared much about creating a strong national identity , the less united means the less dangerous . 
  we have been united under the eu and its previous iterations for a long time , we are n't going from totally separate countries to a union but from making the current union a more centralized one . 
  on another note we do share a common identity and there is no denying it , if i can live in rome or madrid or berlin and have pretty much a similar life it means we are n't much different . 
  sure you can find differences between european countries but they become nothing if you see how similar we are when put in comparison to african , asian and american countries . 
  you should learn a bit more about india , they have 23 official languages and 122 major languages and 1599 other languages ... way more diverse than us for sure . 
  if you want to stay in europe you have belgium and switzerland , a bit less extreme but still countries with different languages . 
  have you ever heard about a nation called india ? 
  if a developing country can manage it , we should as well . 
  just one word : india . 
  btw if the current eu can work with different languages i do n't see how it would be a problem if we became a federal union . 
  more than the reason it is a symptom and while the country is trying to fix the internet problem , we are ' t really fixing the real disease that caused the symptom . 
  first they are affected , second they are smaller . 
  just to be clear it 's not like italy does n't have internet coverage , for example i live in a small town of 1000 people and i get 20mbps . 
  do n't think we are n't upgrading the infrastructure as well since the plan is to get 85 % of the population to have 100mbps or greater and 100 % of the population with at least 30mbps by 2020 . 
  adding to that , italy is actually investing quite a lot and the infrastructure is getting way better every year . 
  with that said , it is still hard to get fiber optics to a small town on the mountains . 
   there was a significant difference between the generations , with just one in three 65-74-year-olds using the internet at all , while among the 14-34 age group , that percentage was 92 percent . 
   `` if twitter forces me to see these things , then they 'll have to see them too , '' so ... how does it work ? 
  does a twitter employee come to your house and make you use the app and see them ? 
  yep, 
  no problem . 
  poland has a 44-44 split with the rest neutral . 
  i really do n't know where you got the data but is not correct and you can check the raw data i used . 
  i misunderstood you at first , yes you are right you could read the data in a different way . 
  i think this map is a fairly logical way to put the data on a map divided by just a couple of colors , but of course there are many other maps that could be done with the same data . 
  belgium has a 51 % of people that do n't trust the eu ( do n't know where you found that 46 but is not the correct number ) therefore gets to be the red . 
  funny thing is , they trust their own national parliament and government even less . 
  the numbers are really low , it 's not like they super love the eu ... it 's more about them hating their own government/parliament more than the eu . 
  if you think about it , it does make sense . 
  made it : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6r60g1/trust_in_eu_national_government_and_national/, 
  in three different surveys they were asked how much they trusted the eu/national government/national parliament , this is a map that shows which institution europeans trust more . 
  lots of data so if i made any mistake , let me know . 
  edit : just noticed i missed luxembourg , it should be red , therefore more people trust the national government . 
  by the way , an interesting fact : most countries have less trust in their own government and parliament than the trust they have in the eu . 
  here is the raw [ data ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bjtpjwv.png ), 
  i rather have no italy than another fascist italy , i do n't want my country to become like the hellholes some of these people are coming from . 
  just to be clear , i am talking about the rule of law which means the country has to follow the laws to do anything . 
  if the country can start following only the laws it likes than it means the country is destroyed . 
  it would n't be the democratic republic of italy , it would be fascist italy . 
  if you go against the rule of law , the country is destroyed today . 
  i am more afraid of my country not following the rule of law and possibly become again a dictatorship than of an african smuggler . 
  i obviously want the situation to be fixed but you might not realize that going against the rule of law means destroying the country . 
  even if they were enemy combatants you ca n't shoot them if they surrender , that would be a human rights violation and would go agains the geneva convention , maybe the most you could do is take them as prisoners of war . 
  i too think that it is a lot but in every city i have been , going from the airport to the city is always expensive since they know that you do n't really have much choice . 
  they have even the crew asking for asylum and the captain under charges of human trafficking ... that is too much to be natural , they have to be performance artists or something . 
  are they trying to be funny or is it just something that comes natural to them ? 
   so for me the only logical solution is to up the stakes for the smugglers , meaning their lives . 
  are they really ready to bet on that . 
  you mean the death penalty ? 
  we as a union do n't do that and for good reasons i would add . 
  i could understand if you want to make the prison sentence be a lifetime one but i do n't see how the death penalty would help at all . 
  just to be clear i am talking in the case they surrender , of course if they use force the navy will reply with force . 
  we just have to arrest them so if they surrender there is no reason for the navy to shoot at them , just to print a clear picture : they use small boats with no weapons ... i do n't see how any of them would not surrender if approached by the italian navy . 
  mostly help with processing them and therefore send those that do n't have a right for asylum back . 
  well if the process is faster , it means it would be easier and faster to send back those that do n't have a right to asylum which most of them do n't . 
  as far as fixing the actual problem , we are at least training the libyan coastguard . 
  what comes next should be fixing libya while striking a deal with tunisia and egypt to open their ports and therefore stop the flow to europe . 
  yep , but the ticket from stansted to the centre of london was n't that much cheaper either so it does n't really matter . 
  you will always have to spend the money to get from the airport to the city . 
  found this :  there is a train going from brussels zaventem airport to brussels central station every 10 minutes between 5am and midnight , 7 days a week . 
  the ride takes 18 minutes and costs $ 12,70 as i was saying , it 's not like going from the airport to the centre is going to be that much cheaper anyway . 
  they get dropped on those island or at most in sicily which is an island as well but you ca n't expect a tiny island like lampedusa to hold that many people , there is n't even the physical space to hold them all there . 
  in theory , they would wait there to have them processed but since there are too many of them , they get redistributed on other ports as well where we have other centres where we hold and process them ... problem is that even those centres are full now . 
  as the articles says , italy is making new laws to make the whole process faster and the eu is proposing to give us some money and people to deal with it . 
  yeah ... if you watch a map , lampedusa is even closer than malta and it 's not like a small island nation like that can take all of them , and it would still and european problem so i do n't see what that would change . 
  as far as tunisia and egypt , as i was saying , they do n't allow them to dock so unless you can convince them ... they ca n't go there either . 
   forbid it for a week , state it far and wide so it reaches the people abusing this whole situation and see how there would be zero shipwrecks there . 
  i understand people in the north did n't care about this before these people reached your land but even when there was no ngos in the mediterranean sea and libya had a dictatorship , we still had plenty of people coming to italy during the summer . 
  we can limit the amount of people coming here , but if you really think they will become zero you are deluded . 
  it 's the only one that lets them dock . 
  btw italy is closer than you might think . 
   why not give the `` lets save them and drop them off at the nearest land instead of acting as a ferry service '' solution ? 
  the problem is that laws are generic and not just about specifics , i understand why if you save someone from a shipwreck you do n't drop them on just the closest land but on the closest ** safe ** land . 
  for example if for some reason i was on a ship and i happen to be saved near the north korean coast i would like to be dropped in south korea . 
  of course that is an extreme example but i would imagine is what the law is designed to stop . 
  it would be nice if the situation was simpler , italy ca n't possibly take more people and something must be done so i would like a solution that does n't lack pragmatism and does not hurt our rights . 
  as i understand it , they are n't necessarily `` brainpower '' but just manpower as in the italian cost guard could use some help . 
  you do have to depart in specific dates and lose pretty much any kind of extras but since the flight is even less than 2 hours , it does n't really matter that much imho . 
  they offer the same cheap prices for brussels as well . 
  i di n't pay for any extra so just those 20 $, 
  i paid 20 $ to go from my local airport , not a big one , to london and come back ... i would say they are pretty close to free already . 
  ** translation : **  if the italian government considers it useful , the eu commission is ready to `` mobilize emergency funds up to $ 100 million for measures needed to enforce the minniti law , and in particular to speed up the asylum and repatriation process , and to assist communities and local authorities that host migrants , and support integration .
