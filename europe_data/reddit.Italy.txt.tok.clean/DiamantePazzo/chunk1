that 's just bending the truth to justify that law because germany , as many other states , is trying to contain the so called wave of populism and instead of understanding why there are so many people pissed off at the government , and fix that , they try and shush them , just like they did in the usa , and look at the results . 
  i appreciate when a left wing leader like merkel or whomever takes the time to analyse his errors and propose a solution , not the usual politically correct bs , just like merkel did recently with harsher conditions for refugees to stay in germany . 
  this on the other hand is just a medieval law that we should never see in 2017 outside of a dictatorship like china or north korea , and it worries me that many liberal people actually stand by it , it 's a matter of principle here , because that same could have been done on the opposite party . 
  in that case you would have seen newspaper titles condemning a clear stab a free speech and a rightful political party representing millions of german voters . 
  just censorship for the ideas they do n't like , if that law would have been made by a right wing government it would have been ( rightly so ) branded as fascist , and it 's even more appalling and worrying considering that it 's being made just before the future elections . 
  from what i heard german police can be pretty harsh , but that is not necessarily a bad thing , excluding this particular instance of course . 
  you summed it up perfectly , the migrant crisis for germany has been resolved in a few months , taking our money to fund it . 
  while the ongoing crisis we have gets no attention nor eu money at all , and it clearly highlights germany 's behaviour in europe, 
  i 'm absolutely against the euro , but again , i studied macroeconomics so that was a big help in understanding the meaning of a currency and how deeply it affects one country 's economy . 
  no shit . 
  just come to italy or greece and see it with your own eyes . 
  it 's not enough , italy is spending something like 10 bilion euros per year to support the refugees , i seriously doubt turkey is making a profit out of that money . 
  i think a big factor is that italian laws are very strict towards ingredients , even though the eu is imposing us to allow shittier quality food . 
  it smells horrible if it 's not been previously castrated , well ahead of slaughtering it . 
  source : in sardinia pig is our `` sacred animal '' , we consume lots of it . 
  so sad , i 'm sardinian too and i do n't speak it , even though i can understand it . 
  the problem lied with the schools where teachers specifically told the parents not to talk to their children in sardinian . 
  now the most conservative language towards latin is going to disappear in the next 20 years . 
  but hey , they 're teaching romanian now in some schools to favor the integration of some immigrants . 
  the italian government , unlike the uk one , is against local languages so it actively tries to discourage scholars from speaking them . 
   ca n't be much worse than ours . 
  have to wait 2 months to see a specialist and sleep out in the hallway at the hospital because it 's too packed . 
  oh really ? 
  in italy in many places you have to wait 1 year and more ( unless it 's an emergency ) . 
  our healthcare system has been constantly declining in many aspects throughout the years , and it was the second in world after france in the year 2000 . 
  this last left wing governments ironically have been the ones to make it even worse . 
  can confirm : in italy it 's same shit , we have higher wages but also higher rent so the problem is the same . 
  you 're right . 
  in italy we have shitty economy and rent prices are sky high , this means that many people are literally forced to stay with their parents . 
  i know that macron is going to win , that 's not the point here . 
  i was explaining my view on why i agree with le pen and her party . 
   she changed the plan far into the election just to attract pro-euro voters , that 's not true , she just did n't mention it like she did numerous other times . 
   and russia is a pretty good example of a backwards thinking , cult of personality antidemocratic regime . 
  i do n't agree , you might not agree with russia 's policies ( i do not ) , but that should n't prevent you for having relations with it . 
  after all we all have warm relations with african dictators , china which is the definition of evil with their [ laogai ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laogai ) , child labour and [ organ harvesting from prisoners ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organ_harvesting_from_falun_gong_practitioners_in_china ) . 
  china in many ways is a modern nazi germany and i do n't hear ** anyone ** putting the same effort they 're doing with russia and you know why ? 
  it 's political , it 's an ally so everyone turns a blind eye . 
  i hear no one advocating for sanctions against tunisia for their [ practices against gay people ] ( https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/12/tunisia-doctors-oppose-anal-test-homosexuality ) . 
   you are twisting what it means to be `` pro-russia '' to make it appear less problematic . 
  it ** is ** less problematic and i provided a few examples above . 
  i have no doubt , if i were french i would vote for le pen right away , and i 'm sad in italy we do n't have a similar leader and party . 
  there is no putin love in italy , there is pragmatism and we do n't believe those useless scaremongering tactics . 
  you did n't understand , i said i agree that that 's one of the points of fn , and i agree on their euro-skepticism . 
   well when one candidate is french trump i took the time to analyse fn 's program and it 's nothing like trump , who , on the other hand , had no program at all . 
  her political points are well articulated in every field from economics to immigration etc , you might not agree with them but that 's another thing altogether . 
   more pro-russia i do n't see any problem with that , italy used to make lots of business with russia and it brought our country lots of investments from the russians , our gdp suffered with the sanctions imposed to them . 
   pro-eu and the entire western democratic order i agree on the first point and i agree with fn 's stance on the matter , the second one is bullshit and in fact you do n't even elaborate on the matter . 
  lol we know what he meant by `` go out and vote '' , voting is good and democratic if you vote macron , otherwise it 's bad . 
  finaly a little bit of common sense , the one that our spineless politicians do n't have here in italy and instead push for letting more migrants come in . 
  it applies to take away pizza too . 
  the title was just clickbait . 
  what a bunch of idiocy : the uk is not getting any `` free lunch '' , it was the next biggest net contributor to the eu after germany , and it also is a net importer of goods from all the other european countries and germany is in the top position of that list . 
  the germans ( not the redditors but the government ) know very well this fact , they 're not going to risk losing 100 billion euros of export to the uk , because guess what ? 
  if they 're not going to sell them goods anymore they 're gon na buy from someone else , the usa probably , so it 's their loss . 
  this is another time again a useless propaganda without any basis in economic reality and anyone who has little background in macroeconomics and finance can understand it pretty well , it 's just a little charade to show the other eu countries that exiting the eu is bad . 
  in italian we have a similar word , also deriving from * coglioni * our equivalent of * cojones * , and that is * coglionazzo * and it 's used for a silly/dumb person . 
  we we 're bored we say : * che due coglioni !, 
  * when we are annoyed : * ho i coglioni girati * -  my balls are turned bored again : * mi sto rompendo i coglioni * -  i 'm breaking my balls stupid person : '' \u00c8 un coglione '', 
  as an italian , i agree with you . 
  very bad marketing here in italy . 
  i hope so , i had the time to actually look at le pen 's political program and i i agree with her 100 % . 
  aww thanks the russians love us ^ despite ^ us ^ being ^ capitalist ^ pigdog ^ scum, 
  just take this upvote , you deserved it . 
  true that unfortunately ... 
  first you wipe , then you wash your butt with soap and water and if necessary the genitals too . 
  also in italy we have a similar law . 
  in italy is mandatory by law for all houses to have at least a bathroom with a bidet . 
  i absolutely do n't trust germany with nuclear weapons or with a bigger army , the situation is fine as it is , nobody is going to invade europe , except the migrants that we are bringing ourselves here . 
  it 's a shame what 's happening there , and the results of this `` free citizenship '' policy are already showing . 
  got wilders . 
  also , those events are n't mutually exclusive . 
  behaviour might be influenced also by genes . 
  the reddiquette says :  please do n't :  * ** downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you do n't personally like it . 
  ** think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you 're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion . 
  if you simply take a moment to stop , think and examine your reasons for downvoting , rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction , you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons . 
  * mass downvote someone else 's posts . 
  if it really is the content you have a problem with ( as opposed to the person ) , by all means vote it down when you come upon it . 
  but do n't go out of your way to seek out an enemy 's posts . 
  * moderate a story based on your opinion of its source . 
  quality of content is more important than who created it . 
  upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it . 
  do n't upvote or downvote comments and posts just because the poster 's username is familiar to you . 
  make your vote based on the content . 
  and also the third rule is being blatantly ignored here in r/europe . 
  it 's always nice to see how people here respect other 's opinion : with indiscriminate downvotes , completely illegal by r/europe 's rules . 
  well we do n't have a pristine reputation abroad , that 's why . 
   a greek default would get them kicked from the eu again , you talk without knowledge . 
  there is absolutely no procedure for kicking out a eu member out of the eu ( and no , brexit is another thing altogether , that 's a voluntary exit out of the eu and the only exit possibile so far ) , nor there is one to kick out someone out of the eurozone . 
   it would immediately cause the investments into greece to cease and a new currency would render savings in greece worthless . 
  they would need to balance international trade pretty quickly ( kind of hard for a country like greece ) and they would be forced to run a balance budget for the forseeable future . 
  again lots of useless info without a glimpse of reality in it : actually to be fair that 's a possibile scenario , very unlikely but still possible . 
  a more likely scenario would the one similar to what happened to argentina after it 's default due to its pegging 1:1 to the us$ , from the year after their default the economy initially shrinked and then it shoot back up to levels significantly higher then before when they un-smartly used a fixed currency that destroyed their current account . 
  of course we 're talking possibilities here , it all depends on how the greeks would react to such a scenario , it might go from catastrophe ( extremely unlikely , except for short term ) to a rebirth of the country . 
   german exposure to greek debt is below 100 bn . 
  100bn $ is n't nothing , also france and italy would be hit really hard and that could easily spiral out of control and trigger a whole new crisis , certainly in europe and possibly worldwide . 
  the first entities to be hit are always the creditors , as you 're the one losing the money owed to you . 
  they might be hit later on if international creditors wo n't trust greece anymore and wo n't loan them money , although that 's an unlikely scenario . 
  wow i 'm surprised that poles like us italians !, 
  it would fuck ** you ** royally , also france and italy because as you might be aware , germany is the first holder of greek debt , followed by france and then italy . 
  that 's a good news , i did n't know .
