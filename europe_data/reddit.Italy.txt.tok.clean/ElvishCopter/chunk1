the cg guy really likes wrinkles . 
  that 's [ san giminiano ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_gimignano ) [ it 's the same tower . 
  dai , diamo compagnia al guardiano dell ' [ asinara ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asinara ) . 
  i think that makes it a spirit . 
  well ... in a country where tax evasion is even worse then here i see that as a positive change . 
  20 bucks on him just being a foot soldier for some italian criminal . 
   donetsk people republic militias i can give you [ this report ] ( https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/05/ukraine-new-evidence-prisoners-tortured-and-killed-amid-conflict/ ) from amnesty international , which points that no party in this war is innocent . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  it 's either that or losing a land and it history forever . 
   drones must be in los already like that here . 
  a lot of them are ignorant and will still be tricked by smugglers . 
  there comes a time where killing civilians is inevitable . 
  if a nation has to defend itself from a rebel faction/invader civilians are going to die . 
  it 's awful and should n't happen , but that is the price of war . 
  that may be viable for ground borders but not for the mediterranean . 
  drifting vessels have to be saved , and since cooperation of northern africa to accept those them back is uncertain there needs to be some sort of infrastructure in southern europe . 
  and with more free beggars / s, 
  the policy that junker wants to push is either taking a quota of those migrants or paying money to the eu to finance the hospitality . 
  there 's also talks about the expansion of opt-out to more countires , this too will be conceded by paying a sum to the eu . 
  - source is [ this ] ( / http://cartadiroma.waypress.eu//rassegnastampa/leggiarticolo.aspx?codice=si74001.tif&amp;subcod=20150903&amp;numpag=1&amp; ) italian newspaper . 
  this seems the most sensible solution for the short term . 
  nice . 
  thanks for the link . 
   the first two containers that were loaded on iskenderoun turkey , contained a total of 491.950 9mm bullets , and about 5,000 weapons ( police type shotguns ) , whose counting still continues . 
  does this mean that there are still more ? 
  i used a machine translator . 
  there 's [ asinara ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asinara ) , an abandoned 52 km ^ 2 island that used to host a prison . 
  we could make serious profit out of it by leasing it to him for some decades . 
  ... brb , becoming italy 's illuminated dictator . 
  scientifically useful and economically sensible for a country under sanctions . 
  comrade putin never disappoints ^ / s, 
  awesome news but the title made me think of [ this ] ( http://www.copsewood.org/ng_rly/sailbogie/sailtr2a.jpg ) . 
  til, 
  the surge in immigration is happening now because isis has risen in the last two years , in 2012 northern africa and the middle east were more stable . 
  and numbers are way inflated by the media . 
  there are 740 + millions europeans , and immigrants are `` only '' few millions a year . 
  can confirm : http://i.imgur.com/x6kzsgy.png imo your tool should be linked in the sidebar , fixed flairs are less flexible . 
  that is true , but mind that even the richest criminal has less money than a government and has to buy guns on the black market , which is way more costly . 
  and imo long range is essentially useless for criminal activities , at most they are going to assault a building . 
  [ an-94 are way more complicated , costly and fragile ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/an-94#design_and_operation ) than a kalashnikov that you can throw in the mud and still operate . 
   the an-94 is unique in that the barrel , gas tube , receiver , and bolt carrier all exist as a single component group moving back and forth along an axis parallel to the bore , suspended within what the russian manufacturers call an effect-envelope -- i do n't think any respectful army would stock weapons with no history , and in the off chance they did they would need to test them for basic accuracy and component quality . 
  those were most likely cheap ak47s and soviet era ammo that were going to be used by various criminal groups . 
  a beaten up ak74 is still better then a cheap gun assembled by an african child worker or a soviet surplus . 
  and even if greece wanted to certify those guns the costs will most likely be higher then just buying a bulk of surplus from the us/eu ( i left off russia because of sanctions ) . 
  on a brighter side the actual political climate is indeed the most pro-lgbt we ever had . 
  i think you found the only way to unite the balkans under a single flag . 
  looking around glyphosate is in the same cancer category ( iarc , 2a ) as french fries/chips and mate herb . 
  this does n't seem * too * bad . 
  kickstarter idea : twitch plays esa 's interact rover . 
  he went as militia , a militiaman usually has to pay for every kind of supply / take it from the enemy . 
  a ) this links to nowhere b ) this `` news '' is at least 2 weeks old, 
  ok , i meant illegal economic migrants , my bad . 
  nothing against people that follow normal procedures . 
  ipconfig / flushdns will solve your problem ^ ^ \\  :d, 
  50 minutes that feel like 15 . 
  definitely worth seeing . 
  those people wo n't stop coming , what the eu needs to do is to start integration programs for the ones that get accepted . 
  this in addition to strengthen border control , redistribution of refugee ( not illegal economic migrants , those have to be pushed back ) and pushing for stability in african countries . 
  edit : specified illegal . 
  that bolted chassis and the light cannon make them looks early '30s tankettes . 
  ca n't hide from me :p long story short : ireland 's economy was highly dependant on foreign investment . 
  add to that the burst of the propriety bubble and there you got the reason of the massive increase in state debt . 
   is there a similar chart [ found it on eurostat , some nations are missing . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/maptoolclosed.do?tab=map&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tgs00048&amp;toolbox=types ) it 's nuts-2 from 2014 . 
  he 's out of w\u00f3dka . 
  sad day indeed , but nothing is going to really change . 
  take our laws : our laws are bent over backwards over media desires but recent blockades only increased traffic over pirate sites . 
  it 's a matter of using anything other then your standard dns , and it 's more then likely that if you 're pirating you 're already doing it . 
  nice to have a glimpse of this , but the eu is so heterogeneous that those graphs are n't really meaningful . 
  cities are well covered , but in any provincial town even adsl is rare . 
  and let 's just forget the south , it puts any charts way down . 
   has recently raised their prices by 25 % . 
  does n't seem so to me . 
  edit : hell , a couple of months ago i got a promotional offer and went from 12 mbps to 30 for like 3 $ / month more . 
  and they should sent back , i agree . 
  but they do n't deserve to die and europe should treat them humanely while they are processed . 
  young and able bodied men are the bulk of african immigrants simply because they are the ones that can work the hardest and send back the most money . 
  they scrape up money from family and friends and work themselves as hard as they can to scrape up money for those trips and take months if not years to get the amount they need . 
  it 's not just a teenage fuss . 
  refugees have always been a fraction of a country 's population . 
  and anyway : the poorer the people the more people they birth . 
  so a country is not `` doomed '' . 
  talking money : once there is basic safety the people remaining will make their best to enhance their condition , just look at afghanistan with its surging gdp . 
  refugees can go back to their countries with no problem at all , if that is their wish . 
  first of all : refugees are anything but affluent . 
  i 'm saying that , in the event of europe closing its borders , poor and ignorant people that want a better life will contact the first ring in the smuggling chain which will sell them europe as a paradise . 
  it 's already happening . 
  excluding eritreans a lot if not most of the poor africans do n't get refugee status and get stuck as illegals in the bordering countries , north eu simply gets a fraction of that kind of migrants . 
  the strategic target of europe should be giving those poor countries basic education and skills by fueling ngos and `` bribing with economic aids '' the poorest of african nations out of dictatorship with financial aid . 
  refugee status is permanent , luckily . 
  if he succeed to arrive his status should be granted , seeing as he is from syria . 
  untrue , a lot of them would be tricked by the smugglers to go and try in any case . 
  are there any razzie awards for newspapers in the uk ? 
  turkey and lebanon are not rich , but they can afford to host hundreds of thousands of people . 
  economically it 's doable , but a lot of people in the eu do n't like to help them . 
  as long as africa is poor and the middle east has war those people are going to come , like it or not . 
  i agree that there must be tighter controls , but a lot of legitimate refugee still have the right to be hosted into europe . 
  well , we are the most pro us country in europe really . 
  us media is the main cause of this , our media is quite low in quality and quantity . 
  about elections : at least in italy people do n't care that much about us politics .
