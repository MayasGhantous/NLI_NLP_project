  yup , the problem is italian * job market * , not the economy . 
  not really , the economy is stagnating . 
  a lot of them prey on failing businesses and staff them with overworking chinese personnel , so italian 's job market is actually worsened . 
  a more serious answer : italy 's predominantly a small business state . 
  chinese small business owners predominantly hire chinese people . 
  they effectively worsen the low-mid skill job market of certain areas . 
  chinese from a specific region predominantly emigrate to italy . 
  italy 's is zhejiang 's usa . 
  that defeats the entire purpose of being vegan , vitamin synthesis is n't really environmentally friendly .

  did anyone of you ready it ? 
  they are complaining about * bundled google apps * , not android itself . 
  get on our level m8 .

  eg : journalist can refuse to reveal their sources , but police can seize any interview just by ordering executives of the company to hand it down . 
  also : we have a freedom for information act , but the government can refuse it with a generic `` may damage italian interests '' cause . 
  and i 've just ignored the whole mafia related menaces sprinkled with china style bureaucracy wall . 
  banned apps mainly . 
  i agree with you : 99 % of the people are fine with the stock store . 
  it 's the 1 % that wants specific apps , some banned because too violent or harm google 's revenues ( adblockers , root tools ) that has an use for that . 
  on the up-to-date part : a lot of apps are on rolling release ( fast ) development , and the ones on aptoide seem to be a couple of steps further . 
  it follows material design , less stringent on what can be on the platform ( eg opt-in adult content ) and tends to have more recent versions of apps on it while still being serious against malware . 
  i would use it as my only market if i had n't bad experiences on botched updates that made me reinstall a couple of apps . 
  you 're bonkers . ? 
  how could n't you possibly be for the removal of a culture ranging back thousands of years ? 
  you people really like fish and chips . 
  i like aptoide . 
  we had a referendum a couple days ago , it did n't get enough votes to be valid . 
  both sides are still flinging feces at each other about it . 
  and you know , most cities still show the signs of the french empire .

  let 's also make a burning money tax . 
  5 $ / month/person . 
  it 's an insignificant amount .

  if you 're not into weird stuff 50 $ are more then enough , the higher end is for fetish or a longer session . 
  first , italy is involved in libya because of migrants is a side effect . 
  the main reason is eni 's oil rigs . 
  what you say is for boats that get caught on time , ie still on libyan waters . 
  i have n't seen nor heard of automatic return of migrants before identification while the boats get caught in international waters . 
  italy follows the swedish model : being a prostitute is n't illegal , but using one is . 
  prostitution is a grey area where laws are n't strictly enforced , especially regarding escorts . 
  most local ad-only newspapers have a miscellaneous category where those women offer their services . 
  street prostitutes range from 40 $ -100 $ depending on the area and the service asked . 
  escorts ( \u2640 ) and * gigol\u00f2 * s ( \u2642 ) go for more or less 10x the street ones , and have a much lower risk of having stds . 
  it 's bloody bonkers , i say !, 
  yeah , let 's seal off the sea . 
  50 % seems only fair , if the limit is lower the vocal minorities would always have their way . 
  a big difference with the dutch system is that the government * must * abide by the result . 
  the only situation where the quorum is 0 % happens when a constitutional reform is passed by the parliament with less then a 66 % majority .

  turnout will be updated at cet 19:00 and 23:00 . 
  poll results will unfold form 23:00 onwards . 
  edit : 4 hours to closing , 23,1 % voted . 
  minimum it 's 50 % , i 'll highly doubt this will pass . 
  edit2 : at 55 % precincts reporting quorum is 31,5 % , 18.5 % short of the legal minimum . 
  the law goes unchanged . 
  duly noting that votes would have been overwhelmingly in favor , at 81 % yes 19 no .

  * parking lot, 
  report digest follows . 
   experts say the eight million drinkers -- a figure which includes 1.5 million people between the ages of 11 and 25 -- risk developing alcohol-related health problems over time . 
    in addition , the report , which was compiled using data collected in 2014 , classified a further 720,000 people across italy as ` heavy drinkers ' . 
    to be considered a ` heavy drinker ' women must consume more than 40 grams of alcohol each day , men more than 60 grams . 
    nationally , problem drinking is a male phenomenon : 460,000 men were said to be heavy drinkers , compared to just 260,000 women . 
    `` heavy drinkers are people who have already damaged their bodies with alcohol , '' said emanuele scafato , who led the team which carried out the study . 
    `` they should be seeking help from alcoholics ' programmes to stop the progression of damage . ''   however , experts say that just 10 percent of all heavy drinkers seek help and that the country 's medical institutions need to do more . 
    `` our doctors are not trained in early identification and swift intervention in cases of problem drinking . 
  for years , national plans to combat the phenomenon have called for this , but it has not yet been integrated into our health care system , '' scafato added . 
    the study revealed that 34 million of italy 's 60 million inhabitants drink alcohol , with eleven million people engaging in a daily tipple . 
   even in super progressive/hipster berlin the germans , turks , africans and even european migrants coexist but do n't mingle or socialize much because their culture are too different , you need at least one generation to see more inclusion . 
  ie : school years are where most people , especially in the north , socialize the most . 
  hmm , i suppose awful quality chinese is the best worst one could find . 
  i would personally gift it to a local school . 
   my understanding is that greece , spain , and italy have had a migrant issue since long before the current situation and calais also predates the refugees from syria . 
  you call that calais situation , i call it a fairly calm summer weekend  to give an idea : these past 48 hours saw 2000 more arrivals to italy , and our reception centers are already lacking accommodation for 17000 people . 
  the first trimester of 2016 saw a +55 % increase of arrivals to italy . 
  that number is expected to grow with the arrival of summer . 
  if the trend is stable arrivals to italy could be no less then 250k , and more realistically around the low 300ks . 
  the only realistic cure to this , if we ignore the various `` let them die/sink '' / become australia , all of whom are impossible in the current mediterranean geopolitical situation , is a stable libya which could cull the arrivals to europe to a more manageable amount . 
   the eu as an entity did not have much concern about migrants/refugees until it became an issue for northern europe . 
  you are correct , but the migrant situation is an hot potato , and the whole europe , bar the south , turned a mostly blind eye to the situation . 
  yes , even germany an sweden 's government ignored ( a malicious mind would add `` willingly '' ) the situation and calmly welcomed the few migrants that came from the south 's `` trickle down immigration '' .
