  2015 was the first year that the seed of inaction really bloomed . 
   would that money not have been better used to both help greece handle the migrants arriving there , while also boosting the greek economy at the same time ? 
  one ca n't expect a country in the midst of a financial crisis ( and with an history of incompetent finance control ) to receive 8 % of its population and process it normally . 
  no matter how many funds get thrown their way . 
  the turkish deal is the lesser of two evils . 
  this is just my personal take on the situation , and by no mean an in depth analysis . 
   interfere in national democracy thank for the post , but with your logic one could say that the italian fascist government was completely justified in its action . 
  they broke no law , just plasmated them at their will . 
  * in absolute numbers . 
  just by looking at [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:at-risk-of-poverty_rate_and_at-risk-of-poverty_threshold_\\ ( for_a_single_person \\ ) , _ 2013_and_2014 . png ) one can see that italy * is * on the lower end , but still 6 position above the country with more % of poor people per capita . 
  fyi , that was a dry joke . 
  scotland is n't exactly known for its sunny and stable climate . 
  that 's why the job `` professional translator '' exists . 
  uk should take every migrant that manages to arrive , but put them exclusively in north scotland tent cities . 
  we have different point of views on what constitutes a massive article , but ok bby . 
  because every single day there 's this britain stays/leaves spam in this sub . 
  it has become annoying . 
  aaah thanks , i removed that historical trauma we called a president . 
   pizza berlusconi wut ? 
  i ca n't seem to find a logical link . 
  because those foods actually made sense , people are n't posting drawbridges and calling them pineapples this time . 
  an headsup from a mediterranean brother : your politics will be pretty `` fun '' for the next few decades, 
  there 's mass hysteria ony in nortwestern europe , i 'm not aware on any significant protest in southern nor eastern europe . 
  edit : fun how this gets downvotes , but not counterarguments . 
  supreme court ruling are accepted , not outright ignored ... unless you 're talking about today 's poland . 
  does n't denmark has a 0 % tier for extremely low income situation ? 
  it could also be that data was collected poorly , ie putting jobless people in the pool . 
  all true , but the focus of the discussion was not on limited national views , but european stability as a whole , for which a stable growth is sufficient . 
  as long as the eu complex grows the institution is n't weakened . 
  intra-eu migration is n't a source of turmoil or conflict , at least here . 
  i would arguably say that only greece and italy are tangible problems : finland still has a solid economy , their situation is negative only in the short term , and portugal is both a little economy and with a stable outlook . 
  greece situation is still grim , while italy 's big problems is `` just '' the banking sector . 
  the deal was all there , using a name for something completely different . 
  touched up machine translation  italy 's pm matteo renzi is now in tehran , capital of iran , on an official two-day visit . 
  the visit began with a handshake with the president of iran , hassan rohani , followed by a meeting in sadabad complex . 
  in a subsequent media conference with iranian press rohani called italy `` a valuable friend of iran even in times of trouble '' , stressing that italy was the first to start relations with the islamic republic of iran in the post-sanctions period . 
  `` before the sanctions italy was our first partner in the eu , and we would like to come back to play this role today , '' he concluded . 
   * rohani : during the period of sanctions italian positions fairer *  rohani said that `` during the sanctions the italian positions were the fairer towards iran . 
  although italy was not part of the 5 + 1 group , the presence of italian mrs. mogherini had a contribution to the negotiations . 
  with the end of the sanctions and the nuclear agreement my first trip was in italy . 
  and today in less than three months after that visit to rome we have italy 's pm renzi on a visit to tehran . 
  both my visit to rome and the visit of president renzi are a very clear sign of the will of the two countries for the development in the area of economics , science and culture . '', 
  rohani said that in january in italy `` 30 agreements were signed and today another 6 . 
  the execution of these 36 agreements could open a new avenue for our relationship and for the arrival of technology in iran . 
  they are good agreements of cooperation in transport , industry , tourism , technology , but now we need to take effective steps to make these agreements ratified . '', 
   * renzi : end of embargo historic step for the region *  speaking to reporters after the talks with president rohani , which lasted about an hour and a half , even the prime minister renzi took its cue from the end of economic sanctions against tehran ( ` historic step for the entire region and for the whole of europe ' ) to highlight the importance of accompanying the efforts of the international community `` by mutual trust and immediate restart of economic relations which are a fundamental element to create confidence in the people and give the message that this was the start of something new . '', 
   * islam and christianity in favor of dialogue against terrorism *  among the topics of the confrontation between the prime minister and the president rohani was the attitude of the great monotheistic religions , contrary to terrorism and constantly looking for the ways of peace and dialogue to overcome divisions between people . 
  `` monotheistic religions like islam have nothing to do with terrorism but represent peace , love , friendship and peaceful coexistence among people , '' said rohani during a joint press conference . 
  `` the closeness between islam and christianity and the fact that both reject terror could lead in to a future collaboration between the two countries '' , in particular with `` more consultations between italy and iran to resolve the situations in syria , yemen , afghanistan and libya '' . 
  matteo renzi quoted the words of rohani when speaking of fighting extremism and intolerance as the `` priority of our cultural dialogue . '', 
  it is therefore necessary to reaffirm `` that the monotheistic religions want dialogue and peace '' , and after the resumption of relations with iran , `` we want to write a new page not only in trade but also in the dialogue and confrontation '' . 
  it 's like calling this a [ ratatouille ] ( http://kiwifaves.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/image5.jpg ) . 
  english cuisne is a lost cause . 
  the half palatable dishes are indian fusion ones , 
  well , * boiling * finely cut cured meat is a war crime . 
  i tried to refer to the abhit of some russians to hang carpets on the walls , and the fact that those peppers loosely look like hanged carpets , but the joke tanked . 
  she 's a really good pr person : criticising italian banks without making the discussion feel so grim . 
  serbs confirmed russians wannabe . 
  boats are starting to come . 
  but you can put down the format : _ _ / _ _ / _ _ _ _ _, 
  the lower the gini the better , if you have a decent economy . 
  that 's just untrue , just look at their gini , hdi or whatever other index , they are in leading positions in all of them . 
  italy 's pretty unequal . 
  in fact latvia 's gini index is the same as italy and it 's getting lower , while italy 's rising . 
  those are raw data , those killed people might be confined to specific demographics , eg drug dealers . 
  perception of safety is a less tangible but better index to see how a country `` feels '' . 
  i bet that even if violent death rate did n't significant change ( terrorist attacks are statistical artifacts in size ) belgian feel much less secure now .

  well , data is from early 2015 . 
  before those guys wen boom-boom . 
  so ... state funded trackers ? 
  let me fire up tixati . 
  [ suck it , latvia !, 
  france : great roasts and wines . 
  switzerland : cheap swiss gas , well paying jobs .

  - egypt says regeni was killed by a criminal gang - after resistance from egyptian authorities the body was transerred to italy , cigarette burns , damaged earlobes and multiple broken bones found . 
  - egypt says video footage that might have had regeni in it was accidentally destroyed - italian detectives arrive to egypt , report of close to 0 collaboration effort from their egyptian counterparts - a gang of criminals is killed and various regeni 's ids an personal objects were supposedly found . 
  anything but the documents has been proven not regeni 's . 
  - egyptian detectives arrive to italy with a week delay every few day or so local egyptian press claimed that either egyptians were collaborating or that investigators got to meet with regeni 's family . 
  both proven false each time . 
  calling back the ambassador was kind of an obliged step , considering that italian news covered the situation almost daily . 
  i took the question as `` available in your country '' . 
  lindt , hands down . 
  mention of honor goes to ferrero 's eponymous rocher .

   people going turkey -  italy this one , if memory does n't fail me a handful of ferries took the direct route turkey -  italy the past years , getting rid of those could be a minor but welcome aid . 
   very critical of merkel on the economic side . 
  they share pretty much the same views on the ever increasing integration , and they can be put under the same social democratic umbrella , with tsipras just waving the far left flag while being a strange flavour of populist with `` classical '' sd views . 
  `` friends who teach the equivalent of high school seniors in the predominantly muslim districts of molenbeek and schaerbeek told him '' yeah , top notch research there . 
  with a stable government for libya , that is going to be the main origin of boats to italy . 
  extending the exchange deal with turkey for a 1:1 legitimate : illegal for boats from turkey would be nice too . 
  yeah , in the meantime libyan ones are grooling for the summer , we 're already on 1000-2000 people/week and that number is likely to increase fivefold in the summer months .
