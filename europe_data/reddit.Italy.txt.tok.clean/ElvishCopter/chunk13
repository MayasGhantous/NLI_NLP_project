  sadly business confidence is both quite lower then customer 's and declining sharply : 100.1 , -3.1 % from february 's 103.2 [ national institute of statistics .

  italian tv has its own arte , too bad it 's on satellite , and not part of the basic channel packs . 
  they have to cover 20 + countries , but i agree that they just loop a lot of segments . 
  that 's because if you step forward to speak up you 'll probably set off a landmine . 
  yay , we 're better then finland for once :p, 
  you apparently , lol . 
  it 's fun how people love to bash on foreign capital havens , but people get all butthurt if you note how uk and its territories , ireland and nederlands are various degrees of tax elusion hubs . 
  luxembourg and liechtenstein also fall under that category but they 're too small to have brigading power on online discussions . 
  at least the swiss do n't act so defensive when you note that the country is `` extremely welcoming '' to foreign finances . 
  and even in that case it was an imf projection .

  what really matters is pollution : area . 
  the planet does n't shrink or inflate with time in any relavant fashion . 
  [ interesting . 
  deflation , a depressing false friend . 
  the more depressing fact is that noone has even uttered the word `` deflation '' in the big tv news channels . 
  `` it 's getting better '' , fuck no , this is at least as bad as economic depression . 
  well , the us area is 2 times larger then eu 's . 
  that means that pollution : area is pretty much even . 
  some dudes made a magazine and also bought advertising on nytimes.com, 
  they do n't really keep many ties with italy really , having `` heritage '' is a thing that seems common in the us but at least here that does n't really mean anything . 
  nor i do of the us . 
  hell , italy forms educated people that flee to the us because of the better employment opportunities . 
  the us has the largest italian native population outside of europe , life there ca n't be that bad . 
  that 's the key , luckily for you and your parents they had enough means to immigrate to the usa , and a job position already guaranteed . 
  afaik both canada and the us mandate an immigrant to have solid means to maintain themselves . 
  i can see we 'll never reach a common ground , but it 's been a pleasure to have a civil discussion . 
  i see a major logical fallacy : the author does n't factor that spending in the us is high , but also much less efficient . 
  an evident example can be found on the medicine cost when compared to income . 
  about social mobility : [ this oecd report ] ( https://www.oecd.org/eco/growth/chapter%205%20gfg%202010.pdf ) paints a good but less glaringly optimistic figure for the us , particularly on intra-generational wage persistency and student performance correlation to family income . 
  taxes are not a shock , but a constant drain . 
  you ca n't possibly believe that therapies costing hundreds of thousands of dollars have the same impact on one 's finances in the us like they have on most european nations , where the burden is shared by the entire population . 
  i do n't see how i implied that the us had programs for the poor , but i can see that homelessness rates in the us is easily higher then most european countries , even when comparing on a us state : european nation basis . 
  or that both the gini index and the ratio of income for 20 % richest to 20 % poorer is higher in the us then most other european countries or eu as a whole . 
  again , the us is a great place to live if you have a good career , but european countries have a much tighter social security net . 
  about education : i would argue that public universities offer good preparation for a much more affordable cost when compared to private institutions in most countries . 
  free under a certain wealth . 
  even if not poor , the fact is that everyone pays it in taxes so an economic shock due to unplanned spending is impossible . 
  that 's what 's happening here :d there 's up to 80 $ pre-tax each month to each worker . 
  surprise surprise people banked it or paid debt with it , private spending did n't change in any significant way . 
  regional election did see a boost for the governing coalition tho . 
  of course , if you 're homeless and/or unemployed the government does n't really give a, 
  was n't the bleeding marathonete a 4chan prank ? 
  in the last map he 's comparing eu regions vs the entire united states ... wut ? 
  * quacks suppressive fire *, 
  let 's do like china or india then , pollute the air and pour factory sewage on the camps . 
  the us is already playing battleship in the south china sea , and russia will pretty much always be a problem . 
  being in europe also means having eyes on the middle east , and those eyes will be kept well open . 
  in other words : * she * got pissed of ** she ** was n't hired .

  i 'm frustrated just about thinking about your frustration lol . 
  funny that you linked to google translate but did n't use it for that word :p, 
  it was a poor reference to the fact that c is not object-oriented .

  thanks for the clip . 
  fyi : if you are proficient in italian the audio is quite understandable at 2x speed . 
  it 's even better when translated in english : cocks-smoker . 
  you ca n't get a more relevant username :|, 
  you forgot being the culinary arts master race , and giving close to 0 fucks about what happens inside other people homes . 
  he 's java , suitable for everything and ideal for nothing . 
  austria did in fact give birth to a exceptionally charismatic character after all . 
  this means italy has the lowest legal age ... which can be 13 if the partner is 16 years or younger btw . 
  a schengen member * also * has visa free travel with other schengen members , schengen is a whole set of agreements . 
  a lot of european countries have 150 + nations with visa free travel , but there are n't 150 + members in schengen . 
  what a weird alphabet . 
  and obviously it 's sad to still see fighting in these times . 
  we have an apple development centre too :d, 
  yeah ... any plans on surveiling the sea ? 
  well , to be fair , spain is the main tourist destinati in in the world , so something good about history is happening . 
  you know it , 
  italy 's becoming europe 's india . 
  ibm closed a deal with the cheapest big country . 
  we have one of the largest populations in the eu , wages for developers & co. are easily 50 % lower here then northern eu . 
  trick is : cost of life is not proportionally lower . 
  and the subreddit style changed . 
  refresh , 
  what about making it 50 % or so transparent and/or black and white ?

  good job , one thing : the snoo in the submission box is too distracting , maybe make it black and white with a 50 % transparency . 
  edit : kudos on you guys , `` shocking '' us with a joke css to transition easily to a new permanent one . 
  luckily the new soviet is formed by equally wealthy comrades , not those western capitalist scum . 
  the bbc is doing an extremely good job since , to paraphrase the opinion piece , there is not a significant volume of impartial scientific research-grade studies on the stay/remain situation . 
  presenting a vs b is as balanced as one can be , until someone can provide a better logic paradigm .
