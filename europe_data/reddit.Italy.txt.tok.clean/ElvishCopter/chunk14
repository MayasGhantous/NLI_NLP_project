  yay , we 're in too . 
    take control of a nuclear power plant  this is a much more likely target . 
  after the recent attacks though , i 'd have those fuckers guarded 24/7 . 
  also , just because you have control of a reactor does n't mean you can set off a meltdown or similar . 
  this is probably the hardest of all , you 'd need to have clearance over multiple security layers , and have a plan to get any radioactive material out without getting noticed , or a platoon/company of special forces with modern equipment and knowledge of the plant . 
  translation  half of the taxpayer 's income does not exceed 16.430 euros , according to the department of finance of the treasury on 2014 tax returns ( those presented in 2015 ) . 
  the total declared income amounted to around 817 billion euro , for an average value of 20.320 euro . 
  compared with the previous year there is an increase of 0.4 % , `` a moderately positive result when compared to the performance of the nominal gdp , which recorded a decrease ( -0.7 % ) . 
  good . 
  both of the parties involved in that protest would have clashed almost immediately . 
  the horror ** **, 
  get a room already . 
  have fun . 
  heh , the top right one is pissed he 's being caught . 
  it 's just a tad bit old : 5459 days more or less . 
  the telegraph : * clickbaiting before it was cool . 
  * also , confirming a sacking \u2260 outlawing criticism altogether . 
  the first that comes to mind is the narrow margin that health services can charge . 
  oh no , the european nightmare :( europe is doomed . 
  another way to tell it : ** death to the poor !, 
  ** sidenote : lol , germany not a `` nanny state '' , yeah on alcohol and smoke maybe . 
  but everything else ... 
  i love this , but i kinda want to see a raving hitler irl . 
  italy - armistice of lyon , 1504 . 
  kingdom of naples under spanish influence and duchy of milan under france . 
  if one wanted to put a milestone to the italian north/south divide this would be it . 
  thank you . 
  he said `` murzy\u0144sko\u015bci '' , polish folk might be of help here . 
  google gives me nothing . 
  net . 
  were n't arabs the baddies now ? 
  i propose an abortion of the abortion ban . 
  private pensions `` raw '' payout , benefits and other subsidies are not included . 
  the uk has a peculiar pension system , a parallel for italy is state subsidies for pensioners that comply with various requirement . 
  austerity worked for spain . 
  the us debt also nearly doubled , something that an economy already over 120 % could n't afford even if allowed . 
  i oversaw that , added . 
  french data on public debt rise and gdp growth looks quite grim . 
  [ france ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu/countries/france_en.htm ) has more margin then [ italy ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu/countries/italy_en.htm ) but the relative situation is worst , ouch indeed . 
  translation of the most relevant parts :  at the start of 2016 18,1 million pensions were given out , with an `` high concentration in lower tiers '' . 
  the national institute of statistics ( istat ) notes that [ ... ] women with pensions below 750 $ are 77,1 % . 
  this is not a poverty index in itself , since a lot of pensioners have other source of income or assistance . 
   51 % of pensions erogated in 2015 were of assistential nature . 
   [ ... ]  63 out of 1000 pensions are for assistance [ eg disability ] . 
  the region with the least assistance pensions is trentino with 2,6 % . 
  the higher disability pension rates is in calabria ( 9,7 % ) . 
  for reference : 750 $ is 72 % of the median pension and 66 % of average . 
  1 , if it 's a touristy spot at least english , preferably also < insert most common tourist language/s here  . 
  to be honest , unless the shop is part of a chain or at least medium sized knowing the owners is more important . 
  come on , at least do n't manipulate the original title . 
   bavarian afd wants to shut down mosques, 
  not exactly , central african people just stop in italy instead of trying their luck up north . 
  this causes the higher variance . 
  i 've got an old i2500 , how much you can give me ? 
  perception is a stupid parameter to use for any definition . 
  people think 20 % of italians are muslim , while they 're just 4 % . 
  you 're right , he just want to kill their whole families https://youtu.be/wwiayquv2om?t=1m37s, 
  somewhat local police ineptitude is merkel 's fault . 
  sadly this rethoric works for a lot of people . 
  fucking lol , no naples nor caserta . 
  they just trew up random numbers over capital cities . 
  damn those too healthy children , good job robot !, 
  jaysus , those are numbers bigger then italy . 
  use public wifi and spoof mac address for good measure . 
  buying `` slightly used '' phones with cash is n't . 
  there 's always a queue , bummer . 
  8 numeric password now needed . 
  7-8-9 digit not allowed . 
  funny enough foreigner unemployment is lower then italians in italy . 
  this data does n't change significantly for the cities with the most mulsim population . 
  that 's the point , you ca n't possibly control the action of hundreds of millions of citizen and the of thousands of kilometers of a country borders with enough granularity to prevent every single terror attack and without crippling economic development . 
   the eu may have to compromise on privacy protections in order to * defeat terrorism * , you can cull terrorism , not outright defeat it . 
  just for this statement alone his views , or at least how cnbc condensed them , are too simplistic to even consider . 
  they might be the closest right equivalent , but you do n't see titles with `` who is most at risk of dementia ? 
  we asked an expert to assess five very brave volunteers . 
  his findings could make you reconsider your lifestyle - before it 's too late '' on the frontpage of the guardian . 
  there is n't any far right in the classical sense in the parliament . 
  poll show that there 's * lega nord * at 13,5 % they are more of a strong right/populist party then far right proper . 
  there 's also the nationalists from * fratell d'italia * at 4,5 %, 
  he 's just a nutjob that wants attention . 
  that 's petty . 
  the pepper grinder broke :( i managed to repair it with my trusty kitchen drawer hammer . 
  eesti confirmed finland 's little cousin . 
  you just excluded the population pool that 's at higher risk of homicide everywhere in the world . 
  my bad . 
  4cha\u00f1 did it . 
  this , unless you 're homeless . 
  in that case countries on the western mediterranean are a better choice . 
  edit : i want to be danish . 
   was preventively detained but they * did * have enough proofs to charge him . 
  i still agree with you that a free terror suspect is still unnerving . 
  mind that the max time to be detained without charge and the max time to have your first hearing after being charged are two different things . 
  [ classic france , losing but refusing to admit it for months ;\\ ) ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/economia/2015/10/07/news/vini_francia_italia-124514999/ ) i 'm just poking fun , i have to admit that french wine is more valuable , so they still earn more even if it volume sold is lower . 
  ps : we 're closing in . 
  ^ he ^ he ^ he, 
  you got it . 
  they did n't have enough proofs apparently . 
   why charge him in the first place then ? 
  is n't the whole point of charging someone with a crime that you can only do it when you actually have the evidence ? 
  ( i do n't know the equivalent british term , bear with me ) he was held under * suspicion * of a crime , but apparently there were n't enough proofs to * indict * him .
