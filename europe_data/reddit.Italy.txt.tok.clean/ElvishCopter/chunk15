  there 's a limited time while you can be held unto detention but have to be charged closely after , this is done to avoid escape , destruction of proof , or generally continue to commit other criminal actions . 
  it 's * limited * to avoid infinite detention without any wrongdoing from the detainee . 
  uhm ... the [ * rechtsstaat * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rechtsstaat ) still works for every suspect , luckily . 
  the gun death and general homicide rates beg to differ . 
  terrorism = discontent . 
  compare the amount of muslims in a country vs islamic terror attacks in said country . 
  less terror attacks = less discontent . 
  and we have europe 's biggest mosque . 
  construction financed by saudis ... italy is truly a muslim hellhole / s there are some things the piigs can do better , 
  we 're quite stingy with our fucks . 
  all of our habitable islands have tourism as a main source of income for good parts of the year . 
  doing what you say would destroy their economy . 
  without considering that giving sustainment for people on an island is far more costly . 
  that 's not true for italy at least , there 's a party who 's main job is conflating minority problems . 
   innocent you triggered / r/europe, 
  there 's not enough space . 
  spain confused portuguese people for muslims . 
  and ... ? 
  i do n't look to an economic environment of a country that 's on the low 40s on the gini index as the ideal solution either . 
  it 's like that already . 
  milan is linked , and it 's far past the alps . 
  if the drills are stopped the price is going to rise since we 'll have to import , consumption is n't going to magically drop . 
  increased costs is a guarantee . 
  how much ? 
  it 's impossible to say , well production varies with the profitability , and the only certainty about opec ( the me oil association ) is their unpredictability . 
  if you account the various airport controls it 's probably faster . 
  and it 's keeping on growing . 
  turin -- lyon high-speed railway will get used ... by my grandsons probably . 
  happy centenary ^ -2 !, 
  newsflash about it [ here ] ( http://flashes.ilpost.it/san-pietro-lampione.html ) . 
  transl : a protester climbed on a street lamp in the middle of st. peter 's square . 
  apparently he was trying to wave a banner about pension problems . 
  i smell money laundering via `` consultants '' . 
   the survey , commissioned by vote leave , also showed that a third of businesses polled believe that the eu hinders businesses . 
  that still put the leave at a 2:1 disadvantage , from their very own poll ...  the leave campaign poll [ ... ] found that 14 % believe that the eu makes it easier for their business to employ people while 31 % believe the eu makes it harder . 
  55 % are neutral ...  more businesses ( 32 % ) said the eu hinders businesses like theirs than helps their business ( 25 % ) . 
  43 % neutral those are kinda weak points , but perfect example of bad data representation from a biased source . 
  oh come on , the ony relevant image is an out of focus jpeg . 
  lol . 
  whoops , i was sleepy and forgot to point out that the italian student was on the catalonia bus , not another one . 
  italia forte . 
  well , belgium stuff happened . 
  anyway , italy : - bus carrying erasmus students crashed in catalonia , 4 italians students dead . 
  our media has creepily focused on one of the girl 's eye photogeny . 
  ( last update of the situation [ here ] ( http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/mondo/europa/2016/03/20/incidente-bus-erasmus-catalogna14-morti_e7e06d55-cf41-4f31-af4f-b3d6a6cb4727.html ) , italian ) . 
  - one italian victim in maelbeek bombings confirmed , was officially missing .

  lower is better fyi . 
  italy 's lower by a mere 0.7 points , and wealth is not as geographically polarized . 
  we do have north/south , but they have madrid/everything else . 
  terror attacks are extremely unlikely to happen , unlike the popular fear mongering going now europe in its entirety is much safer than most areas . 
  yes , even paris or bruxelles . 
  he wants a lower gini index . 
  [ uhm ... ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-defense-budget-iduskcn0w80tl ), 
  got to go for spain , close second russia . 
  edit : andorra 's gave me the chills . 
  oh ho ho , chemtrails consipiracy is depressingly popular here . 
  complaining is part of our culture .

  the newspiece is actually worth a read . 
  who ? 
  slowed growth \u2260 dramatic decline . 
  they 're still growing  5 % each year . 
  pfft , get on 2001 g8 levels violence . 
  then we 'll speak . 
  that 's was due to happen : there 's an endemic fear of - long term investments , both public and private . 
  getting a loan is also really difficult - we 've one of the lowest tertiary education rates in europe , coupled with a highly theoretical teaching enviroment - public balance is awful - the entire banking sector is generally falling - surge of populist parties that just block law reforms - there 's either granitic employment laws or no-rights employment contracts - tens of thousands of illegal migrants every month rise the state gdp/debt ratio ~ 0,3 % every year , and make property cost plummet i could go on but i do n't want to get a cancer . 
  that 's the kind of person that ended their karma . 
  he 'll die by drowning in a glass of water . 
  uefa 's is europe 's fifa , they put profit over everything . 
  they 'll not close them unless they 're ordered to . 
  could they also start actually deporting the ones that got refused their asylum request ? 
  hm , the registrant of thesaker.is used a yadex.ru email ( russia 's google ) , they 're not even trying to cover their tracks . 
  what fun !, 
  that if you force two people that have grown to hate each other together the situation either ends in submission or apathy . 
  do you think that before asking for divorce the two people did n't already discuss it ? 
  a buffer time also force someone living in an abusive relationship to endure more of it . 
  those times also implied marital submission ... 
  just make it harder to divorce then , duh !, 
  that 's really ... optimistic . 
  relative poorer countries , ie baltics , wo n't have that high of a growth constantly . 
   blasts heard during another police operation most of the time it 's the police themselves koolraiding the place . 
  russian politics in a nutshell . 
  that 's what i call a morning wood . 
  is there any lower joule limit for the license ? 
  or would one need it even for a bic barrel ? 
  ^ even ^ your ^ username ^ screams . 
  romania best mania . 
  the basketball teams might even score a 3 pointer !, 
  eh , iran is quite permissive by * islamic standards * , [ these headwears are permitted ] ( http://ajammc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/iranwomen2.jpg ) . 
  saudis could be a better comparison . 
  uuh , we 've got plenty of them . 
  the most common suffixes are '' - ese '' , '' - ense '' , '' - giano '' , `` ino '' . 
  if you buy the politician you buy the police , dozen of towns every year get `` commissioned '' because top political figures have their hands deep in the organized crime scene . 
  that and the culture of * omert\u00e0 * make it close to impossible to prove criminal conduct until is blatant . 
  it 's sloooowly getting better in these past years but there 's still lot to be done . 
   `` they are our terrorists , '' he said . 
  `` they were born here , not in syria . 
  they went to our schools . 
  they were supposed to be part of our society .
