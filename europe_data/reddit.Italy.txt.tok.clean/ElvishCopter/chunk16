  but now they fight the free and open society . 
  this is a difficult question . 
  and there is no silver bullet answer to this . '', 
  if only more people understood this . 
  when the moons align . 
  that 's an ignorantly broad alert . 
  the iberian peninsula , norway , finland and eastern europe are essentially risk free . 
  not here . 
  a clarification : * mafia * is used as an all-encompassing term , but technically relates to sicilian gangs . 
  the name for neapolitan and generally campania region is * camorra * . 
  afaik home search without a warrant is possible only during top level terrorist threat in most eu contrives . 
  the current situation is quite odd honestly : they can enter the home already but only during the day ? 
  odd . 
  jaysus , unmotivated arrest for 2 weeks and basically ignore private property ? 
  that 's quite terrifying . 
  yep , english is sadly lacking in dick related imprecations :p, 
  trump trumpets the most popular opinion , it 's like saying `` italy has a corruption problem '' . 
  thank my dick , does he have a solution that does n't violate basic human rights ? 
  ok , but is this relevant to europe ? 
   the leftists ' very own hero for us ' standards . 
  he 's center right by continental standards . 
  this sub has a big anti rational discussion of islam vibe to it , especially soon after terror attacks . 
  lol no , most light skinned indians look like italians . 
  somebody might even talk to you in italian . 
  boko haram is affiliated with isis , but it 's an african terror group , they are n't interested in europe . 
  and different wars . 
  conscripts , especially in the earlier years , were reluctant to actually fight the enemy . 
  how do you dare post actual research ? 
  and thanks . 
  i know that corsica is french , but i seriously doubt that there 's a significant muslim population there . 
  then cameron is doing a good job at butchering nhs  / s, 
  are n't most of them african ? 
  it 's the arab muslim nationals that pose a concrete risk . 
  eh , italy would be far down the rank of terrorism risk if what in reality is just extortion enforcement was kept out . 
  it 's more an index of general untargeted violence , not specifically terrorism . 
  they do have a lot of internally displaced people from the east tho . 
  but border russia , so ... 
  that definition is pretty broad , murders from criminal organizations fall under the definition . 
   plus in theory there should n't be refugees not true . 
  the current pact , if ever implemented , is a 1:1 exchange of illegal migrant : proper refugee . 
   anti-immigrant sentiment in belgium means that muslim youths , though many are natural-born belgian citizens , are particularly likely to be socially isolated and alienated . 
  * that 's why we must isolate them more . 
  they 'll pollute our society !, 
  * is the recurring tone you hear often . 
  there 's simply too many of those migrants ... 
  there are multiple chinese restaurants and penny shops in every italian city . 
  there 's 1 chinese restaurant every 10000 person here , and probably the same for bars . 
  a lot of them also work in the textile industry . 
  finnish it with those puns . 
  low brow banter is followed by low brow answers , but thanks for correcting me . 
  but muh ~ ~ freedoms ~ ~ lobbies . 
  * miami * , usa . 
  * valence * , france . 
  * biberach an der ri\u00df * , germany . 
  * ma'alot - tarshiha * , israel . 
  there 's not even a road with any of those cities ' name . 
  the only thing that couples the cities is a delegation that carries traditional performances , few students and trade associations representatives every few years . 
  well , in a way it is . 
  icann has its headquarters on us soil . 
  a significant amount of italians are in the uk working jobs with a better pay that they could ever hope to have here , so a lot of them feel strongly towards brexit . 
  another proof that italians are the polish of the 2010s ... yay . 
  forgot i posted here already uups . 
  that explains the [ jew officials in the ss and wehrmacht ] ( http://www.fpp.co.uk/online/00/03/nsjews.html ) . 
  what 's interesting about italy is the heterogeneity , 17th by foreign population but 4th by variety of origin . 
  60 % born in `` other '' , behind only uk ( 64,5 % ) , sweden ( 67,1 ) , norway ( 68,9 ) . 
  [ main country of origin table ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/3/37/main_countries_of_citizenship_and_birth_of_the_foreign_foreign-born_population%2c_1_january_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_%28in_absolute_numbers_and_as_a_percentage_of_the_total_foreign_foreign-born_population%29_yb15.png ), 
  * that syrian guy does n't count , he 's cool . 
  security and fiscal policies are still mostly controlled by the member states in an uncoordinated fashion . 
  there 's more need of intelligence and fiscal cooperation if we want to be safer from terrorism and asian products destroying the continent 's economy . 
  there would be no government , but an autonomous neural network administered by some chill and benevolent dictators . 
  did you even read it ? 
  it 's not that long . 
   `` the security services must work together , and better together , with constant , timely and continuous cooperation , ''  a threat that is global but killers which are local '' should be fought `` with security forces but also primary school teachers ... if we are to save the next generation , '' he 's not talking about military , but prevention via shared intelligence and education targeting the young . 
  kinda low effort , i bet they have a form with < insert country here  . 
  nice people , quite a lot are going back to poland from italy . 
  our economy stagnates while yours is rising . 
   print your own guns/bullets . 
  that 's already possible and affordable with a few thousands euro . 
  wow , you know where they are ? 
  please inform security forces immediately !, 
  sorry , i meant to put islamic . 
  decent integration policies , also italy has remain unscathed because a ) we mostly got african people , muslims seem to like ne more . 
  b ) there are n't big clusters of minority religions . 
  italian newspaper source : http://www.ilmessaggero.it/roma/cronaca/roma_emergenza_topi-1622834.html ^ ^ ^ ^ source , ^ ^ ^ ^ salsa , ^ ^ ^ ^ sauce, 
  you ca n't simply block the flow of these people . 
  you can aim to control and moderate it . 
  even then , when every country acts on its own the solutions will always be sub par . 
  no , saying to bordering country : `` stop them , it 's your responsibility '' is not a solution . 
  those people needs to be stopped before they reach eu 's shores . 
  that 's so sad it 's hilarious . 
  * corruption in european countries . 
  boot boot , thank mr boat . 
  and we 're the bundle of sticks that tries to fit in . 
  i do n't know , i had yet to take my coffee . 
  that 's worse then , the `` a '' in `` ano '' is like the one in `` alphabet '' . 
  does n't scotland has huge reserves of oil ? 
  that 's horrible ... 
  sanctions means less interest for the country to fight people smugglers , since it 's just a waste of money if trade with a rich nation is halted or impeded . 
  libya was stable with qaddafi , he controlled its southern borders and used to ease controls and anti smuggler operations to negotiate with italy . 
  now there are two governments that have some kind of control , sanctioning them would destroy the unification process .
