  moroccans that arrived to italy by boat in 2015 were [ less then 5000 ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/solidarieta/immigrazione/2016/01/07/news/flussi_migratori_12_mesi_di_sbarchi_in_europa-130787694/ ) , it 's a minuscule amount when compared to 154000 landings total . 
  do you have a vague idea how much time you 'll stay ? 
  weeks ... years ? 
  dubrovnik looks like the best choice if you do n't plan to stay for a lot of time . 
  if you do lisbon might be a better choice . 
  also , what do you like to eat ? 
  if you say what you like to eat the most we might narrow the search . 
  [ / r/italy wiki , i choose you !,

  the word is `` ja '' , but a lot pronounce it like a deep `` yo '' . 
  most suicides by hanging kill by strangulation , which takes a lot of painful minutes . 
  the rope might also break , the knot could hold for not enough time ... 
  explosives are easier to setup and they are much more consistent . 
  your alternative is sanctions , which means less stability and more immigrants ...  stable nations with arabs also breed terrorists . 
  yep , but when a nation gets richer , or at least stable , people do n't emigrate as much . 
  less arab immigrants means lower risk and welfare expenditures . 
  look at syria , when the country had peace migrants from there were in insignificant numbers . 
  or morocco and romania , 10-20 years ago they were the main countries of origin for migrants , now their numbers are close to 0 . 
  - isole falkland - the people showed that they want them to remain british , this is sufficient for me . 
  - look at south sudan , the whole of sudan voted in the referendum , and various international entities monitored it . 
   former american president jimmy carter , former united nations secretary general kofi annan and former tanzanian prime minister joseph warioba led the carter center international observation delegation . 
  us senator john kerry , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , visited southern sudan three times during the referendum period , including during polling . 
  george clooney , who is supporting the satellite sentinel project [ 80 ] ( using satellites as a conflict early warning system for sudan ) , also made visits to sudan during the referendum period . 
  several major regional organisations deployed international observers , including the african union , the european union , the league of arab states and the intergovernmental authority on development ( igad ) . 
  these organisations issued a joint press statement on the first day of polling . 
   domestic observation organisations also deployed sudanese men and women to observe the process , these included the sudanese network for democratic elections ( sunde ) , the sudan domestic elections monitoring programme ( sudemop ) and the sudanese group for democracy and elections ( sugde ) . 
  other national civil society organisations were also accredited as observers . 
   normally , the un does not deploy electoral observers , however , in response to a request from the parties of the cpa , the united nations secretary-general 's panel on the referenda in the sudan was established . 
  the panel is composed of three senior officials , former tanzania president benjamin mkapa , former minister of foreign affairs of portugal ant\u00f3nio monteiro , and bhojraj pokharel , a former chairman of the election commission of nepal , who are appointed by and report to the un secretary-general . 
  the panel made periodic visits to sudan during the referendum period and is supported by field reporting officers and stakeholder-observer liaison officers . 
  most of italy 's migrants come from central africa , so you want stable states to buffer them . 
  plus , you know , unstable arab nations breed terrorists . 
  that would be strategical suicide : you want stability for the countries on your borders . 
  and italy does n't have the luxury to be able to send them back , no northern african country is going to collaborate on this . 
  fyi , my precedent message was n't intended to be sarcastic . 
  qa and production should be two different levels , but management only listen to marketing ... 
  i thought i was being absurd enough , come on . 
  sliced bread is the sole reason why i 'm still on this continent . 
   food in england is rather bad by european standards ( especially bread how can one fail so bad at making bread ... ah england , nvm . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpkqz77gu4c ) is the best there is on youtube . 
  she 's interviewing a regional governor that , long story short , is friends with the local criminal organizations . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.rai.tv/dl/raitv/programmi/media/contentitem-7a998af2-2882-4696-9761-11f245acbea2.html ) is the latest episode , she 's interviewing the main two right wing candidates mayors for rome . 
  sadly you can see it only with an italian ip . 
  the man is berlusconi 's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 bertolaso , the woman is meloni , leader of the third right wing party in parliament . 
  bertolaso recently criticized meloni 's candidature by objecting that , since she 's pregnant , she should stay home and then take care of the baby . 
  meloni is riding the wave of that dumb declaration . 
  the host asks precise questions and gives them time to answer hardly interrupting without a reason . 
  we 're italian , if you leave a politician completely off the leash they 're going to ramble without saying anything . 
  we have * in 1/2 h * ( * in mezz ` ora * - in half an hour ) every sunday . 
  the format is similar , minus the weekly news breakdown : 30 minutes , one politician / important person that 's not a celebrity . 
  the host 's questions are generally sharp and unavoidable . 
  you 're allowed that yoke only after feasting on surstr\u00f6mming . 
  looks like a mix between central italy and naples . 
  if we want to talk force projection germany and italy follow close . 
  of course they 're not in the nuclear club . 
  do n't be yuvenile , there 's nothing to yoke about . 
  huh til . 
  but this subs ' ambiance scares away that kind of people . 
  public transport is also far from being cheap . 
  newsflash : north korea close to conquering melbourne . 
  after tax , * reddito disponibile * -  * disposable income * . 
  add 2000 for the poorest and scale it exponential-ish up to 11000 for the richest . 
  public services efficacy and efficiency vary massively between south and north . 
  not since ~ ~ the accident ~ ~ after ww2 . 
  southern italy also receives a lot of funds from the eu for economic development , and with a reason . 
  look at average disposable wage breakdown by region [ here ] ( http://www.youtrend.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/reddito-italiano-medio.png ) , which reflects into eu 's [ region classification ] ( https://i.imgur.com/6ujenea.png ) . 
  edit : a word . 
  denmark and netherlands saw an insignificant amount of migrants , even when compared to their population . 
  this time the emus have no chance !, 
  awful title , but for once article 's content presents both points of view . 
  welcome to the shock images party krautcamarade . 
  finmeccanica is a holding with subsidiaries that produce planes , helicopters , armored vehicles , radars , weapon systems , fincantieri owns three shipyards for military ships and submarine production , beretta explains itself . 
  there are also a few more companies that make small weapons . 
  the arms industry has been growing double digits for a few years . 
  ** italy ** - 7 million people will receive a pension simulation by physical mail . 
  this is positive because 25 % working age people do n't have any kind of access to the internet and a mere 30 % uses the online pension agency tools . 
  - [ this video ] ( http://video.corriere.it/coraggio-poliziotto-incurante-pistola-aggredisce-rapinatore-armato-mette-tappeto/f4b51006-ed10-11e5-a691-1e1091159f0c?intcmp=video_wall_hp ) of a policeman disarming an armed robber went mildly viral . 
  italian tradition , tracking down terrorists one pizza-at-a-time . 
  that 's an unusually warm manhole cover . 
  props on sticking to your beliefs , this sub gets toxic often . 
  my mobile provider was already set to bypass this eu law 2 years ago ... 
  i had to pay 3 $ / day with a whooping 25mb/day cap before paying something like 0,50 $ / mb . 
  but the annoyance is still there , if i want to manually hide it i already do it with ublock 's cosmetic filter tool . 
  i tried idcac , but * imo * it 's efficiency is too limited . 
  most cookie warnings also do n't appear if you block page scripts by default , which is reasonable to do if you uhm , sail the high seas frequently . 
  tl ; dr : happy it exists but i do n't have a use for it . 
  yeah , it 's something , but local websites are n't in their lists . 
   italian prime minister matteo renzi said friday his government had no plans to intervene directly . 
  `` we are against a military initiative , without a request from the local government , '' from italy 's pov it 's a sensible decision : without some local legitimization terrorists will have a strong point to carry out attacks against a country that , until then , had minimal involvement on fighting daesh . 
  agree , and quite relevant username . 
  good luck finding a beggar with the money to appeal the fine in court . 
  because it 's socially acceptable to get drunk if you use this festivity as an excuse . 
  calais -  dover is ~ 40 km , you can see land on a clear day . 
  lampedusa -  closest tunisian shore ~ 120 km , and tunisia is stable , so migrant boats from there are close to 0 . 
  lampedusa -  closest libyan shore ~ 270 km , and most boats have  300km travels . 
  props to [ carmen simion ] ( https://whois.domaintools.com/visitbogata.com ) for this genius idea .

   the busiest seaway in the world . 
  this , a lot of people forget that they also cross the mediterranean from lybia to italy . 
  roughness or distance is n't really a factor .
