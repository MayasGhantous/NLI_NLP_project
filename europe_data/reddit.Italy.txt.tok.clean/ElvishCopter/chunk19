  libyan authorities insist that the italians were executed , but the kind of wounds make it look unlikely : the 2 workers were killed by high caliber rifle gunfire to the torso . 
  [ that bird is too little europe , now it 's fixed .

  ah , * i profughi della vlora * , they were closer to ~ ~ 20000 ~ ~ 27000 . 
  this photo gives an idea of how many people were stuffed there : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/profughi_della_vlora_in_banchina_a_bari_8_agosto_1991.jpg, 
  tyvm . 
  it was from [ here ] ( http://www.tovima.gr/world/article/?aid=783919 ) by the way . 
  hm interesting , i 'm not aware of any italian media reporting it . 
  austria should make its own cloudflare , and call it `` swarzjack & nutten '' . 
  but your e-commerce website will be too slow . 
  cloudflare is a far better alternative . 
  the caveat is that world 2016 is multithreaded . 
  if austria 16.3 keeps working single-threaded it will find itself slower and with more problems in the future . 
  it 's not in mainstream discussions because it 's not happening ... yet , we 'll see in the summer . 
  think of refugees as marbles , the ones already on europe 's doorstep were aimed at greece . 
  new marbles might be aimed at albania , but it will take a while . 
  the border is also much easier to control . 
  it 's a narrow strip of sea but 1 . there are no islands scattered between it-al 2 . the closest distance is ~ 80 km , not few hundred meters 3 . 
  italy is albania 's main trading partner by far and it 's in friendly terms with them , so cooperation is much likely and easier . 
   what does that mean ? 
  the areas of and near : bolzano , northern trento , northern friuli . 
  also : lol , nice flair . 
  austria has done an incredible job in taking more migrants than italy , even in absolute numbers , and they 're 7 times smaller then us . 
  what i ca n't understand is the refusal of well ... the only deal that can cull the arrivals . 
  there are no viable alternatives as of now . 
  it makes 0 sense , the schengen situation is already bad now . 
  what would happen when georgia , armenia , azerbaijan , iran , ** iraq ** and ** syria ** become countries on eu 's border ? 
  there 's also this `` minor '' human rights thing that turkey needs to sort out . 
  i do n't understand austria decisions : they want both to close entries to migrants and refuse the turkey deal . 
  do they have a viable alternative ? 
  here 's a zoom on italy ( not oc ) : https://imgur.com/a/8gzaa direct link : http://pvnmtt.it/pages/optimap/italia_reddit.html, 
  good luck on getting any kind of credit for a few years . 
   should not have what 's done is done , they ca n't run away from it now . 
  not even a child is so irresponsible . 
   a reactionary drawing , light the pyre !, 
  too bad most muslims the uk gets are pakistani , eu or not eu wo n't change the situation . 
  anywhere in the germanic parts of italy . 
  nightlife is almost nonexistent there , so there is close to 0 trash to start with . 
  most small towns , < 10000 or so , are also well kept . 
  lol , a funny german . 
  any chance to have flairs reintroduced or is thos out of scope of a css change ? 
  you 're probably that kind of person that buys a $ 10 chinese umbrella at gas stations :p, 
  your mind must be an oblivion arena . 
  you should either drink more or less . 
  in any case your drunkenness is not at an adequate level . 
  well , roman mythology is just a plagiary of greek 's , does it count ? 
  was i hallucinating or did you have an usa flag until few minutes ago ? 
  the blame is on merkel 's sky rim . 
  spain is hairier italy . 
  even their language is just italian with a ball of fur in their mouth , and under mdma .

  our minister of defense is an ex high school italian teacher turned politician , hardy anyone with knowledge of the military ... 
  but hey , war is effectively impossible to happen , so that position is used to parrot our pm decisions . 
  margaret thatcher , in someone 's opinion famous for being inept in war matters , even if her decisions kept the falklands under british rule .

  i do n't either , that peak is for all intent and purposes french , you 'd need to hop multiple 4000 + mountains to reach it from italy , while it 's a matter of following one road and doing a single ascent to reach it from france . 
  google is n't a government , http://questions.assemblee-nationale.fr/q13/13-76121qe.htm, 
  the border passes exactly on the peak , so technically it 's neither completely italian nor french . 
  the mont blanc peak is disputed between france and italy , albeit the map does n't show it . 
  the good lil adolfo tried , but nooo . 
  americans had to put it down :( ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  1st : corsica is french , sardinia is italian . 
  2nd : that 's how you destroy a local economy . 
  sicily already has 25 % of italy 's refugees , and keeps getting a quarter of new arrivals . 
  and it 's the 3rd most poor region out of 20 . 
  sardinia is the 6th poorest and every resource there needs to be by boat , which is far more expensive then on mainland . 
  well , everyone 's more racist towards roma and blacks and tolerates lgbt more . 
  make of it what you will . 
  if that confuses you do n't try to get ... anything done here . 
  that was only tutorial level difficulty :p, 
  pretty much , i forgot to point out that wrongful termination is harder to prove and the punishment for most situations is only a fine and not a re-employment anymore . 
  of course the news comes from ** mash ** able . 
  tax relaxation for new hires and relaxation of worker rights coupled with increasing worker rights as the employment lengthens . 
  eg : wrongful termination is harder to prove and the punishment for most situations is only a fine and not a re-employment anymore . 
  it helped older people , 40 years and over . 
  his measures ( well padoan 's , he 's the economy and finances minister ) actually improved employment for that age range , the national institute of statistics published data a couple of days ago . 
  [ here 's the press release . 
  ] ( http://www.istat.it/en/archive/182488 )  temporary employees ' transitions towards ** permanent jobs grew ** ( +3.5 points ) as well as transitions from para-subordinate workers to employees ( +14.4 points ) both for temporary and for permanent workers . 
  moreover permanence in unemployment decreased ( -5.1 points ) and the ** possibility of shifting to ** employment ( +2.1 points ) or to ** inactivity ** ( +3.0 points ) increased . 
  if you stop and think you realize that veteran workers saw progress and younger ones were either employed with temporary jobs or outright abandoned the job market and became neet . 
  sadly pensions and older people wages will always be the main focus , they 're the main vote pool . 
  even renzi , who can be considered enlightened ( * when compared to his immediate predecessors * ) did n't care about newly employed people . 
  funny enough italy was more divided in the 90s than it is now . 
  italy : food spain : arid , party uk : rain , drunks , 5 o'clock tea poland : boar , special forces,
