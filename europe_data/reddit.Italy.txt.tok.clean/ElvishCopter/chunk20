  some hundreds , not tens of thousands of them . 
  minor islands neither , the usable ones are touristic and amassing immigrants there would destroy their touristic economy . 
   suppose wo n't happen , the only parties * that would do this are completely incompetent on economic policies , and migrants will be the last of our problems if that happen . 
  * : lega nord , xenophobic anti $ ; m5s : populist progressive with a sprinkle of environmentalist nuts . 
  unlike many in this sub would like to do italy is mandated by international law to help vessels in distress . 
  the funny part is that we do n't have the luxury to be able to seal our borders . 
  it 's a parodied way to write * duce * , the title of italy 's dictator . 
  something something dvce . 
  in italy it 's the opposite : the main nationalist parties , forza nuova and fratelli d'italia , have seen their support fall ( fn ) and remain stable ( fi ) . 
  populism is on the rise , not nationalism . 
  the one rising significantly are movimento cinque stelle ( m5s ) , and lega nord ( ln ) . 
  m5s is populist with a complex mixture of progressivism , conservative and anti eu ideas , ln far right with xenophobic and anti economic integration . 
  helicopters and more regular vehicles are also used , but since those two cars were a gift what better use then organ transplant ? 
  2 lamborghinis ca n't cover the entire italian territory so they 're mostly used for planned operations . 
  sorry , i 've used an currency converter that used us notation and thought you spent over 300k $ the price is not absurd . 
   lamborghini recently donated a specially made edition of its latest huracan lp 610-4 sports car to italy 's state police - capable of over-hauling most getaway drivers . 
  that 's not what it 's used for , 99 % of the time it 's deployed for urgent organ transfer . 
  alread posted . 
  that 's probably the only thing where italy , greece and spain will probably act with one voice . 
  what fun will be this summer , i expect much many boats then the past two years . 
  am italian , please keep making kebap . 
  it 's these stupid protesters that make me wish for an enlightened dictatorship like singapore 's . 
  i can tell you italy 's system : medium and big sized businesses have `` national contracts '' where wages are discussed between unions the businesses ( usually an entire category , ie metal workers ) . 
  also , a lot of professions have a min and a max amount if compensation . 
  regarding wages proper : there 's just a vague `` reasonable compensation '' enshrined in the law . 
  most of those countries without min mage have much stronger unions then average .

  `` proper '' banks ? 
  no one of them , our banking sector is plummeting and it 'll be a while till they become healthy again . 
  the safest bet in the near future is opening an account in a small or average size credit union , one that does n't focus too much on finance but has has `` real credit '' as a main focus . 
  those have a limited amount of branches and are present in a small area . 
  also , do your homework and see if the institution is healthy by looking on financial news . 
  the answer is : it depends on where you 'll reside/pass most of your time . 
  mind you that this is my ignorant opinion . 
  `` cooperative credit '' is also quite popular here too . 
  # was used for the italian lira , our currency before $ . 
  to get $ there 's altgr +5 or altgr + e. 
  and altgr + e is kind of intuitive ( e for euro ) . 
  sorry , but turkey 's military has 300 % the budget of greece . 
  and nato members are mandated to help only in case of aggression . 
  that guy is diplomacy inept . 
  i 'm an idiot , my image is not the italian standard one . 
  have you read the country of origin of the immigrants ? 
  that 's not even 48 hours old ... 
  also , quoting this post 's content :  nearly four million ( out of five ) of the non-italians come from outside the european union with the biggest contingents hailing from albania and other parts of eastern europe , north africa , china , south asia and the philippines . 
  a side note about refugees arrivals nationality in 2015 ( [ italian source , sept. 2015 data ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/solidarieta/immigrazione/2015/09/01/news/migranti_profughi_cose_da_sapere_domande_risposte_faq-121963703/ ) ) :  they are mostly eritrean ( 29.019 ) , nigerian ( 13.788 ) , somali ( 8.559 ) , sudanese ( 6.745 ) and syrian ( 6.324 ) . 
  china is close to produce its own stealth fighter , and india has shown multiple times that they can manage to put satellites in orbit with a fraction on the west 's cost . 
  we do n't hear much about them because they do n't export much of their military and advanced scientific solutions .

  well , italy has lower foreigner unemployment then italian . 
  for a while it was declared illegal , but being classified as `` traditional food '' helped it become barely legal again . 
  better then pulling out .

  here 's a table with countries that have overcrowded prisons . 
  country | density -- | -- hungary | 142,0 % belgium | 129,0 % fyrom | 123,1 % greece | 121,4 % albania | 119,9 % slovenia | 117,7 % france | 114,5 % portugal | 111,2 % spain | 110,1 % italy | 109,8 % romania | 109,1 % austria | 101,1 % greece is the 4th worst . 
  not good at all , but what the hell hungary ? 
  and belgium , you 're part of the `` rich '' group , ca n't build some more prisons ?

  wikipedia relies on volunteers ' editors , if you 've got time to spare you could update it with the actual content of the source . 
  automatic condom distributors could be a solution to avoid embarrassment , i 've no idea how serbians would react to that tho . 
  the economic part still remains ... oh well , best of luck . 
  i can , but with these laws you ca n't go and make/look around for amateur aerials of city landscapes and monuments . 
  the only ones you can find are up to early 2015 when regulations were n't updated yet . 
  hq content is extremely rare because of this . 
  it 's mildly bothering , that 's it .

   the proportion of eu-citizens among foreign inmates across europe represented 30.8 % ( 34.6 % ) . 
  this category of foreign inmates has decreased between 2013 ( when they represented on average 37.2 % ) and 2014 .

  the same reason why this post will get deleted this post in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 
  however : general vibe i could get is `` unreliable source '' . 
  that 's pretty useless , to have a meaningful comparison you 'd need per capita data . 
  it depends on your individual definition of `` better '' .
