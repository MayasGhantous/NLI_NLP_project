  every kind of migration has been increasing , but the african trend is much slower then the arab 's . 
  just look at the graphs in [ this document . 
  ] ( http://ucs.interno.gov.it/files/allegatipag/1263/immigrazione_in_italia.pdf ), 
  he never said the numbers would be the same . 
  lol , yeah . 
  italy saw tens of thousands boat arrivals each year since the late 90 's . 
  and greece always was incredibly permeable . 
  i understand that 's not the intent of your comment , but you 're essentially suggesting to make the trip to europe cheaper . 
  yeah , they 'd magically stop coming . 
  damn german gremlin ... 
  surprise anschluss . 
  ca n't you just use trenitalia ? 
  they are n't using the `` spy '' rhetoric anymore , that briefly happened when it was discovered he worked a year for [ oxford analytica ] ( https://www.oxan.com/ ) , an uk based international consulting firm . 
  i 'd speculate that he just interned . 
  now the news are talking more about the lies and lack of cooperation from egyptian authorities .

   enso-gutzeit 's headquarters replaced this building there would have been an uprising if someone did that in my country .

  italy : [ casa.it ] ( http://www.casa.it/ ) and [ immobiliare.it ] ( http://www.immobiliare.it/ ) are the bigger ones . 
  if you 're interested in one particular area say so , and i 'll gladly give you a link for a local agency . 
   do you think that these measurements are directed primarily against muslims or against businesses that decrease appeal of italian cities ? 
  it depends on the city really , most of the times this kind of limitation is done to avoid an eclipse of the traditional businesses . 
  sadly this same principle is often abused to mask anti- < insert minority  , like in verona 's case . 
   do you think that cities should have right to regulate types of businesses in cities if the goal is to preserve its attractiveness for visitors ? 
  absolutely , a totally free market is also damaging in the long term . 
  multinationals and what not would stomp small local business to the ground . 
   are these concerns with `` disneyfication '' of cities real or exaggerated ? 
  in italy 's case , no . 
  i 'm in favor of stringent rules for a city 's decorum , with a free-for-all logic cities will turn into a post-communist hell . 
  it 's exactly those rules that avoid a city like ferrara ( [ here ] ( http://www.clubdipiu.com/userfiles/image/agenzia%20matrimoniale%20clubdipi%c3%b9%20ferrara.jpg ) ) to become a disorganized mess . 
  edit : post-communist , not neo-communist, 
  rt did a good piece about it , for once : https://www.rt.com/news/334015-verona-bans-kebab-shops/ for additional context : verona is a lega nord stronghold , they 're a far right populist party with ~ 15 % votes on a national level and a frequent regional majority in veneto , lombardy and piedmont . 
  not with some good shoes and wolf repellent :p, 
  the uk is important , but not * that * much . 
  it would slow the eu , not outright destroy it . 
  at least italy is extremely resilient to external food regulation . 
  does anyone have a mirror ? 
  the italian version would probably be an upset guy with crossed arms . 
   italian : italian people sound like they are complaining about something . 
  that because small talk is mainly complaining :p, 
  it was one of the most popular cheap building style . 
  they 're supposedly `` sails '' . 
  they were supposed to have a `` community '' feeling . 
  with no open spaces and no way to entertain people ( bars , parks , etc. ), 
  the situation evolved into rampant crime and close to 0 opportunities for the people there . 
  soft power , good pr . 
  if the us champions freedom of speech , tolerance , or even just stability , more people will see your country under a brighter light and be more attracted both economically and politically .

  that would 've been my second choice actually . 
  i could n't care less , it was the reaction time of the swarm that surprised me . 
  hello mr. spambotto . 
  and starting a war with china to continue selling opium ... 
  opposing mouths silenced , milord . 
  italy . 
  have fun austria ( strongest party in the balkans ) , france , croatia , switzerland , slovenia with the ones that reach northern italy . 
  let 's just hope that libyans can get a government and ask for help , so at least we can start getting that mess secured . 
  south western europeans are n't with a stick up their asses about immigration , plus germany and sweden can still be considered immigrant friendly . 
  edit : disprove me at least , downvotes not even 2 minutes after my post lol . 
  death to san marino !,

  i want to write a comment but do n't want the downvotes . 
  i guess norwegian , i like those `` random '' stops in the middle of a word . 
  merci beaucoup . 
  if i understand correctly : a breach in the law happens only when the private entity who 's encripted the data refuses to decrypt it . 
  so a third party holding encrypted data does n't violate the law . 
  looks to me that this is just a law adapting to newer technologies , and not an orwellian move . 
  again , please feel free to correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  yep , someone tried to post it here y/day night too . 
  okay , i 'm game , let 's play some more :  frustration on christianity if you read again i have n't criticized the christian religion , only one statement of one chief of one church . 
  then i stated a fact about two important channels of communications between italy and the vatican . 
  also : interesting how you chose to counter a religious representation with political ones . 
   coddling the littlle and docile muslims . 
  i fail to see how the muslim religion is relevant in this context . 
  dammit , i fell for the bait . 
  well played , pantalone . 
  let 's put aside the fact that it has only passed the first step of approval and is not in effect yet . 
  does anyone have the integral text of this law ? 
  unless those men are radio beacons for the rest of the division that 's a gravely undermanned division . 
  no power ? 
  look up on [ italian episcopal conference ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_episcopal_conference ) and the [ lateran treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lateran_treaty ) . 
  no other religious institution has this level of interface and collaboration with the italian state . 
  no , hungary . 
  the submarine goes * under * water . 
  `` ideologies are the poison of politics '' then go the fuck out of italian politics , and learn what `` invasion '' actually means . 
   but usually they had to become clergy exactly , and if you 're a priest you are n't working the land , so only a fringe of people could join the clergy . 
  eeeeh , universal school for non noble people is a fairly new concept . 
  [ waaait a second  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_battleship_charles_martel#career )  charles martel was ultimately stricken from the naval register in ** 1922 ** and sold for scrapping that year .
