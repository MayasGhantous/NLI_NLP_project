  but rome 's green light came with a caveat that underscores the challenges the u.s. faces as it attempts to win commitments from allies in the fight against the extremist group : the italians granted permission for the drones to be used only defensively , to protect u.s. special-operations forces in libya , the officials said . 
  u.s. officials are still attempting to persuade the italian government to allow the drones , based at naval air station sigonella on the island of sicily since 2011 , to be used for offensive operations like one the u.s. conducted friday against a training camp near the border town of sabratha , libya , targeting a senior islamic state operative and dozens more militants . 
  but in private conversations over the past year , italian officials have balked at that step , the officials said , fearful of igniting domestic , antiwar opposition , especially in cases in which the italians could be blamed for civilian casualties . 
  italian prime minister matteo renzi 's office declined to comment . 
  fears about such operations are real : the serbian government said on saturday that friday 's strike , conducted by manned american aircraft based in the u.k. , killed two serbian hostages who were being held at the camp near sabratha . 
  u.s. officials have n't confirmed any civilian casualties .

  photo : john moore/getty images until last month , the u.s. drones based in sicily were for surveillance purposes only . 
  the new permission to allow armed drones , which has n't been disclosed previously , comes as the obama administration is considering a more comprehensive strategy against islamic state in libya . 
  that could lead to a campaign in which a small coalition conducts sustained airstrikes and specialized forces work with libyan forces to fight the extremists , u.s. officials said . 
  but the white house is n't eager to commit to such a strategy . 
  the `` parent tumor '' of islamic state , as defense secretary ash carter often says , remains in iraq and syria . 
  `` we 're going to continue to respond to the isil threat as it develops , '' pentagon spokesman peter cook said friday , using an acronym for islamic state in describing the current u.s. strategy . 
  `` we are carrying out a significant campaign against isil in iraq and syria , and we are prepared -- as we have demonstrated in the last 24 hours -- to strike isil in other parts of the world , as they pose a threat . '' along with sigonella , the u.s. is also seeking to establish a drone base in north africa to put aircraft even closer , increasing the efficiency and speed of such operations , according to officials familiar with such operations . 
  though just across the mediterranean sea , sigonella is not an ideal solution for drone operations over libya , since weather conditions and cloud cover often mean drone flights from the base have to be scrapped . 
  but talks with countries in north africa have n't yet borne fruit , u.s. officials said . 
  all this takes place as the u.s. and its allies await the outcome of talks in libya on forming a unity government -- a necessary step for creating a viable partner with which to fight islamic state . 
  the british and the french have hinted publicly that they would contribute to a mission in libya once such a government were formed , and the italians have gone so far as to say they might consider sending as many as 5,000 troops for stabilization efforts . 
  but such a government in libya has remained elusive . 
  in the meantime , washington has been concerned about lining up ways to counter islamic state 's rapidly growing influence in libya , where the group now has an estimated 6,000 fighters , according to the pentagon . 
  the permission the u.s. had sought from the italians was a long time in coming , beginning early last year , and the secretive talks did n't take any real form until april , said an official knowledgeable about the talks . 
  `` it 's fair to say that the italians had to go through a complex approval process on their side in order to grant us approval to fly these missions , '' a senior defense official said . 
  you 're right , and you can extend that for any state job . 
  the navy was the only one with a `` proper '' ad because they are the one with most political influence and ... can allow themselves to make useless ads . 
  i 'd argue that if britain , italy and other european countries that want more independence form a front and push for this 2 speed idea bruxelles has to answer . 
  i do n't see this idea as fanta-politics , there are already 2 countries willing to do this . 
  myself i hope that britain does n't completely leave the eu , but it 's your country and it 's britain people that have a say in this . 
  the italian government is in favor of two-speed eu , but bruxelles is ruled by franco-germans . 
  loosely speaking , yes . 
  you can also get 2 fremms for every type 45 .

  let 's fight our fremms 1 on 1 , and we 'll see who 's better , mwhaha .
