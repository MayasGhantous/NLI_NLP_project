  to be fair , while superior on the naval theater , the italian version does not have the french 's land attack capabilities .

  what i can say about this whole situation is that outright leaving would make the uk a more marginal player with the eu and harm the global power of the european * area * as a whole . 
  uk included . 
  a decent solution would be reforming the eu into a tiered organization with higher integration for the willing members .

  if you request it and the authorities do n't outright refuse it yes , but it 's a temporary code and , depending by the country , you might be detained while waiting for it . 
  it depends by country , but generally you 'd get fingerprinted and checked for a match on the local and europol database . 
  even if you do n't provide any other documents the police can guess your country of origin by your look and contact the country 's authority in search of a match . 
  in most cases you 're free to roam the nation you 're in while your situation is being processed , or get detained in a low security facility . 
  you could then just flee and become an illegal immigrant . 
  to give an idea to foreigners : he 's talking about * decreto legge * , it does n't require previous approval but it 's automatically invalid if it 's not ratified before the end of the 60th day from the date of its publication on the * gazzetta ufficiale * .

  you would only obtain emergency treatment in an hospital , and nothing else . 
  your best bet is going to some rural area , work illegally and keep to yourself .

  rosi spent months living on the mediterranean island , capturing its history , culture and the current everyday reality of its 6,000-strong local population as hundreds of migrants land on its shores on a weekly basis .
