   border control - was n't mentioned .

  they both seems quite hike friendly too . 
  not when your landlord and employers are friend and uncle of germany . 
  if you 're really in lombardy you 're delusional , italy has only to lose by going out . 
  do you really think that by giving back all public spending control to a government that ca n't last 2 years on average you 're going to see growth ?

  with a sample of 11,410 respondents , it is representative for the european union as a whole . 
  at the same time , it is also representative for the six largest member states ( germany , france , great britain , italy , spain and poland ) . 
  i share their general undertone and ideas , but they need to work on being more open about their selection methodology , i see no mention of normalization of that sample .

  da'esh is a very real threat , but not as much as it can seem . 
  if they were really powerful , and not just loud and good at blowing themselves up , they would have wiped those scarcely armed kurdish and peshmerga forces . 
  instead they fight this highly asymmetrical warfare with a suicide bomber every few weeks or so . 
  the employee value will decrease , people will be more apt to work for a lower wage , due to no state aid . 
  legitimate workers , both uk and eu ones got the short end of the stick . 
  i should have been more accurate , i 'll give you that . 
  i do n't see how that contradicts my statement , they get regionally distributed on an affordable location for the local government . 
  [ the same happens in italy ] ( http://www.ansa.it/webimages/img_700/2015/5/7/b6f9b6c6de8e680151ca89922c74e36e.jpg ) , some controlled directly by the region and others by privates that get public incentives for every guest . 
  for halal and kosher meat there 's a special exception . 
  for every other kind stunning is mandatory . 
  religious practices are quite strongly protected here , and that pisses me off ... c'est la vie . 
  i think that in 2019 the special permit needs to be amended , but do n't quote me on this last fact .

   housing benefits it depends vastly , but the tougher limit for public housing is ~ 10k $ yearly income . 
   means based scholarships highschool is free , public university free if income < ~ 12k $ , tax for median income is ~ 800 $ / yr . 
  books can be 500-900 $ / yr depending on the field , no income discounts . 
  eased housing too little to be worth mentioning . 
  italy is contributive , but not exceedingly strict : you need at least 13 weeks of work in the last 4 years , at least 30 days in the last year . 
  max duration of benefits is ( worked weeks ) / 2 up to 2 years . 
  ok , for the sake of it i checked italy 's standards . 
  the situation is less clear , and it does n't mandate stunning first . 
  the killing cut must be done with a sharp blade and a single clean cut and `` without useless suffering '' . 
  maybe it 's because i grew up in a village and heard the squealing of killed rabbits now and then , but the concept does n't really shock me . 
  it 's meat , you killed an animal for it , and it suffered some seconds top . 
  the answer is even simpler : countryside is cheaper and no state wants to spend more then necessary on helping its citizens , even less with foreigners . 
  honestly that 's a huge factor that 's way underreported . 
  the uk will get foreign cheaper engineers to work at slave wages with no benefits . 
  yes , most of italy 's advanced flight certifications and trainings are done in collaboration with the us . 
  this flight was also used as a training exercise on refueling for the kc-767a tankers crews . 
  oh well , i take that back . 
  still , a cut from a skilled butcher should kill in a few seconds . 
  i prefer bloody meat , but i 'm not morally opposed to a butchering method were the suffering is minimal . 
  do you realize that syria is n't the only state where people are fleeing from persecution or war ? 
  we just call it * repubblica ceca * ( czech republic ) here . 
  * cechia * might be said by a fringe of old people , but that 's it . 
  since the first answer i received deviated i tried to wrap it up with a conclusive statement . 
  about the syrian situation : helping [ the weakest faction ] ( http://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2016/19-february-4-air-strikes-carried-out-by-russia-on-besieged ) ( green ) is far from a reasonable stance . 
  iraq sees the same enemy but in a different scenario , i 'm generally not opposed to uk intervention there . 
   since the animals can not be stunned am i missing something ? 
  stunning is done in most ~ ~ halal ~ ~ and kosher killings afaik . 
  i do n't , but i consider proper knowledge about the sexual sphere severely lacking in teenagers . 
  a big problem with the uk is that they intervene too much . 
  while humanitarian aid is great , military offensives are far less reasonable by shadowing the us will . 
  does n't seems the * main * cause for france , more likely it 's due to their highly pro children framework . 
  the peak of emigration that happened when baby boomers entered the workforce but migrated to sweden for lack of opportunities is really noticeable . 
  like increasing the people fleeing by supporting the weakest side ? 
  that only shows a part of the picture : italian citizens are already decreasing , but * residents * make up for the contraction . 
  it 's happening so frequently that probably there will be news when there * is n't * a tear gas attack . 
  financing from a foreign firm is at least controversial , real traceability stops when the jurisdiction ends . 
  sorry , but a commission of expert knows more then the average parent or a thousands year old book on sexual reproduction . 
  then they enter a negative spiral from which is almost impossible to go out . 
  less performance --  less funds --  lesser performance ... a school is not a business , you ca n't treat them with market logic . 
  shh , you 've got to give the uk some slack , they are clearly the ones being most affected by the calais situation :(, 
  let 's do it only for female students ... this sounds oddly familiar . 
  the scenario is also important : this was happening on school grounds , not in some shady parking lot . 
  he basically wants the positive side of the eu while removing less convenient obligations . 
  it 's simply not feasible unless both parties compromise . 
  let 's get real , turkey will never be really cooperative and east europe is just too poor to impose sufficiently tough controls . 
  strategical efforts are the only useful solution .
