  short : * yes * * long * yes , economically it only makes sense to cooperate on a regional level without having to discuss terms with every separate state . 
  italian financial reforms are also kept in check by the eu , without them you would see horrible populist reforms and our debt/gdp would skyrocket even more . 
  cheaper chinese products would also be almost unstoppable without a strong regulatory voice that italy could never have by itself . 
  external custom tax and internal free trade are the most important economic asset for italy , without it italy would n't be able to compete . 
  what i would love to see is strong common external border control and as free as possible intra-eu travel and trade .

  this link is a newsflash , i 've found [ an article ] ( http://bologna.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/02/16/news/bologna_il_figlio_di_erdogan_indagato_per_riciclaggio-133566205/ ) that goes a little more in-depth , but it 's in italian . 
  february 16 , 2016 *** bologna *** - bilal erdogan , son of the recep tayyip , is subjected to investigation by the prosecutors of bologna for the offense of money laundering . 
  prosecutor manuela cavallo is investigating as result of a complaint by murat hakan uzan , businessman and political opponent of erdogan , a refugee in france . 
  the * esposto * asked to investigate any funds brought into italy from bilal , with the suspect of money laundering . 
  the son of erdogan , who 's lawyer is john throop , moved to emilia in fall for a doctorate at johns hopkins university . 
  in december , the university wall and other nearby buildings were vandalized with graffiti accusing erdogan of terrorism . 
  according to reports , erdogan has filed a lawsuit . 
  '' *** a large sum of money . 
  *** '' the son of erdogan , in emilia since last fall , is studying for a doctorate at johns hopkins university . 
  the presence of bill and his wife and children had created domestic political controversy : the official reason for the transfer is the resumption of studies , a doctorate started in 2007 . 
  but , according to some anti-government sources , he would have flown in italy in late september `` with a large sum of money '' as part of an alleged `` escape plan '' . 
  these allegations were filed by lawyer massimiliano annetta of the florence forum in lieu of his client murat hakan huzan . 
  *** a large armed contingent . 
  *** huzan considers himself a victim of political and judicial harassment by the prime minister of turkey . 
  the * esposto * , written in both italian and english , states that bilal erdogan appeared in bologna with a large armed contingent of bodyguards , whose entry into italy was not allowed . 
  the bodyguards were therefore conferred on them turkish diplomatic passports after a few hours . 
  ( sorry for the lousy translation , but i 'm weak on judicial terms and auto translators are no use . ), 
  that too . 
  it 's fun how most people are using gross contributions , the uk is a wealthy state . 
  for these critics to be useful to a discussion on `` fairness '' they should go by expenditures/gdp . 
  i 've asked for proof of the 2 million estimates , and it 's still not given by anyone . 
  simple question for simple answers .
