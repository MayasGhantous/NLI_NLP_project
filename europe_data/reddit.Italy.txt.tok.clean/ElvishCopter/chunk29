  italy was and is under a much higher financial stress compared to de-fr-uk . 
  what op said might be intended as italy being a stingy nation to eu budget . 
  italy is still a strong giver to the eu even with the crisis it 's suffering . 
  so , immigration is a linear function immune to external variables , k, 
  you 're assuming that politic is going to sleep . 
  the situation is changing towards stricter borders . 
  it 's nice to see that people can avoid grouping every refugee under `` economic migrant '' . 
  too bad this post is going to get so nuked . 
  enlighten me . 
  source ? 
  mmmh tastes of super-inflation . 
  uhm i forgot norway is near russia , makes sense then . 
  to put it in perspective : that 's like italy ordering 218 f-35 . 
  looks pretty ... pointless to order so many of them , and italy is more active internationally . 
  i too would like to go shopping on a mobile icbm vehicle .

   the solution to the pollution crisis is < radically change culture  you really think that revolutionizing a culture would be the easier solution ?

  good job . 
  one question : what 's that 8 % offset in methane emissions after halving of production ? 
  less efficiency due to smaller production ? 
  well , like the animation said the eu is focused on more efficient farming , not starting policies to reduce meat consumption habits . 
  if you want to feel safer just get a dog . 
  this is just a lie , italy is a net contributor . 
   considered a component of federalization in a positive light and remained agnostic on others , hence opinion is slightly positive . 
  do n't you see an india-like situation as a viable solution ? 
  they have states with a lot of differences but still act as one . 
  the small and wealthy are either sitting on a bed of oil ( which will not last forever ) , financial hubs or geographically advantaged ports . 
  * but tricks ? 
  * they already dominate the technological side , countering them , if even possible , would need multi-decade long plans , a strong europe would fit pretty nice in this timeframe . 
  countering tricks would also need to either install semi-democracies , which puts stakes too high if you look at what strong power has done in the past in our culture , or transform a completely different life ethics , a japan like one . 
  this last options is simply fantapolitics . 
  and i 've completely ignored that our culture luckily helps the most disadvantaged layer of society and gives free time to people instead of becoming drones . 
  it simply makes sense to act as one , at least economically . 
  china and emerging markets would crush us otherwise . 
  i like to think that a shengen 2.0 will be eventually reached . 
  italy has the [ * coppa italia * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coppa_italia ) ( italy cup ) , essentially it 's the champions league with italian teams .

  it 's a formal declaration , of course you find this kind of talk . 
  nah , not really . 
  it was simply because there was an overproduction of rice . 
  i post that kind of comment every now and then to test their presence , 
  read : `` i do n't get to decide by my own , eu is tyrannical '', 
  yeah , we 're more about wheat carbs here . 
  there is an organization/industrial groups superpower in government influence . 
  this leads to crappy situation for low income workers . 
  add it to one off measures for social assistance and you 've got a cambodian minefield for social scalability . 
  too much beer this early ? 
  i would be drunk too if i were belgian hehe .

  bloody continentals . 
  someone 's got their period . 
  and on top of that even a 3 houses cluster can make a municipality in france . 
  honestly finland seems like a bad country where to store nuclear material . 
  with all those lakes the land is probably pretty porous , you want the densest and most durable rock to shield you , on top of an ultra durable container . 
  i should n't have used the heat metaphor . 
  imagine radioactive material as a rotting egg , but the smell will kill you . 
  you want to avoid being exposed to even a really small amount of that `` smell '' . 
  there are n't big cities , but to counter it there are 8053 municipalities . 
  took me a second to visualize it , nice how you put the squares where the nation would have been . 
  i like polands ' hat . 
   nintendo uk is the seller , nintendo is probably the most rigid company about rights . 
  you need raw mass to contain radiation . 
  the material also need to remain stable against enormous amounts of radiation ( think of radiation as a really hot heat source , you do n't want the container to melt ) . 
  this new cement can remain stable against incredibly prolonged exposition to a radioactive source . 
  there are different kind of radiation and yada yada , this is an eli5 . 
  oh , i did n't think it was that big of a problem .

  norway , stop being so great . 
  you 're making us look bad . 
   but nucular bad  :( it 's relieving knowing that some nations can be more rational , godspeed uk . 
  not everything is near 20 % , every eu28 country has reduced vat rates for specific products , commonly essential goods sits on the lowest vat rate level . 
  those money go back , the state is indeed a business that gives its dividend to its shareholders : it 's citizens . 
  you can complain about complex regulations and bureaucracy , but comparing high taxes to slavery only shows your nihilism . 
   europe 's new fines for breaking europe 's laws could cost you 4 % of your revenues should be the title . 
   u.s. businesses . 
  we enjoy an environment in which there is no comprehensive information privacy law , and we 're becoming increasingly inured to data breaches and government snooping , some confused rambling about absolute liberism , anti-customer idealism and subtle admission of gaming the system .

  second one is that ussr used cheap comebacks .

  it 's cozy here in southern europe . 
  rivals , i guess france . 
  both of our nations are known in the world for the same reasons . 
  they are also trying to get a foothold in lybia and iran , important italian partners . 
  and rightfully so , not an euro country , no decision over euro policy . 
  lovely how this post gets buried .
