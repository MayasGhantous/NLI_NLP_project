  it 's a goddamn proposal ... do you want me to list each of the 5000 amendments on civil unions in italy ? 
  and 50000 or so passed , a 92 % success rate . 
  `` we will join you in other ways to stem this tide because of the potential of its damage to the fabric of a united europe '' gives a really different vibe to the article , does n't it ? 
  ignoring the tangent you took , i hope you recognize that all that military help the us gives away is to keep otherwise weak pro-us governments in power . 
  saudis are going to do what they are already doing in yemen : limited intervention to indirectly help their friendly side in the conflict . 
  turkey will at most pull a new cyprus with limited land grab and eradication of kurdish forces with some `` incidents '' against harmless civilians . 
  call me back when the turks get into damascus and make syria their province . 
  edit : no more turkish horses, 
  a'ight , sorry for the misunderstanding . 
  i get rt on satellite , and i consider it as russia 's fox news . 
  terrible as sole source of information but great to get kremlin 's agenda . 
  the us a instaurated a us friendly government and pulled off before security forces were sufficiently capable . 
  this power vacuum caused already present rebel groups to have an inept government as the sole opponent . 
  this faulty strategy goes back to the cold war where both the us and ussr tried to expand their areas of influence ; it 's been a game of tug of war ever since . 
  iraq 's invasion was an us decision . 
  now it 's moscow 's turn , but there is also third actor in the play : enriched islamic nations . 
  so no , you ca n't consider isis as an entity that created itself . 
  responsibilities need to be acknowledged to avoid repeating past errors . 
  how do you even link what i said with is apologysm ? 
  lol, 
  but they steal . 
  stereotype train . 
  yes , all . 
  because roma people are doing fine and dandy and everyone is happy with the eu . 
  seems like the lights for a pathway to me . 
  edit : sorry op , did n't see your post . 
  that 's an unusual use of * invasion * , they 're more likely to enact sorties with a relatively limited occupation . 
  which turkey seems to have already done in the recent past , albeit in a more limited fashion . 
  nothing to see here , i 'm just a picnic express . 
   the six country immigran oh , it 's the same study . 
  i got confused because it 's a 2013 article referencing a 2008 study . 
  i thought the two were different studies somehow . 
  well , then the situation probably changed quite a bit in the last 8 years . 
  the study was contucted before the arab spring . 
  well , denmark is a welfare state . 
  poland hardly as much as them . 
   and get assad 's regime to do concessions https://i.imgur.com/zncm62r.jpg let 's get neck deep into syria , wcgw ? 
  the west intervention and meddling into putting in power certain people are the cause of the modern events . 
  thanks for the article , what 's the study 's methodology ? 
  i could n't find it . 
  yeah , fuck right to privacy . 
  that main failed his class of crowd control 101 .

  sorry , but have you read it ? 
   the head of the italian bishops ' conference , angelo bagnasco , on thursday urged lawmakers in the second chamber of parliament to allow secret voting to ensure they really followed their consciences . 
  a bishop has no say in how the legislative process proceeds . 
  \u02b0\u1d49\u02b0\u1d49 \u1d47\u1d58\u1d57\u1d57, 
  we 're talking wholesale price , it 's going to be half of that . 
  also take in account that poland is a cheap country . 
  let 's put aside the 2nd and and 3rd euro economy , that 'll do wonders ... ( i get your sarcasm , i 'm just poking back ), 
  that 's why nutella was cheap these last months . 
  [ here 's a link ] ( http://www.eufic.org/article/en/expid/fruit-vegetable-consumption-europe/ ) after a super fast googling , italy is second only to poland for fruit and vegetable consumption/capita . 
  and mind that italians tend to go lighter on seasonings , opposite to saxon and anglo-saxon cultures . 
  just look at google images results for [ * italian pizza * ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=italian+pizza&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1017&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjhgeelmplkahxdoxokhzy2cxcq_auibigb ) vs [ * north european pizza * ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=british+pizza&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj7lyuqmplkahugwhokhvc5dhqq_auibygb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1017#tbm=isch&amp;q=north+european+pizza ) . 
  you can easily see that typical recipes here are much more lighter . 
   over the past seven years 85 people have been found , with most of their deaths eventually explained . 
  that newspiece is playing with the fear that some in the community have . 
  he should get those charges in pamplona , not ireland . 
  * calcio fiorentino * ( florence football ) , 27 vs 27 in a 85 * 42 in sandy field , half a football field .

  i suppose you are talking the [ triangle of death ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/triangle_of_death_\\ ( italy \\ ) ) ? 
  it 's isolated to a relatively small area with 150000ish people , so it does n't `` break '' the statistics . 
  outrageous , but the nation as a whole is healthy cancer-wise . 
  is this ppp - ied ? 
  yet we 're near the top for pollution deaths/capita . 
  also the only eu nation that had pb ( toxic metal ) readings above the safety limit in 2015 , and the one with most ^ no 2 deaths/capita .

  i 'm that kind of person that wastes hours to squeeze 50 mhz more , pointless tweaking is kinda my hobby :p, 
  slightly ot , but thanks for making me discover sabayon , i wanted to get started on gentoo but i was too lazy to start from scratch . 
  in italy she would be a light chestnut-brown ( * castano chiaro * ) . 
  the newspiece does n't actually say that the refugee complained , only an unrelated mp . 
  it was reposted a couple of hours ago by the guardian on their fb page , but automod does n't like fb links . 
  completely ... haram ? 
   nato will contribute critical information and surveillance to help counter human trafficking and criminal networks . 
  they have a surveillance role , not intervention . 
  just putting it here for people that do n't open links . 
  just to play devil 's advocate : is it that bad for a * former * terrorist supporter to be exposed to the day to day life of a gay person . 
  he might as well realize that the roommate is n't a monster . 
  seems like a logical consequence of montenegro 's will ( forced by geographical location ) to be more pro-eu then pro-russia . 
  oh come on , the syrian collapse is what caused it . 
  merkel catalyzed the refugee influx but she 's far from the primary cause . 
  til sweden ca n't project more power then norway or denmark . 
  great location , i 'll just be deep in the castle 's dungeons , away from those weirdos . 
  in the event of a true war most of the baltic states would be used to drain russian onrush , and establish proper defenses in central europe . 
  they are in an indefensible position , just like most of northern italy lowlands during the cold war . 
  troops and resources stationed there were intended to sacrifice themselves to allow dependable position to be set up , and gather offensive forces for a counterattack . 
  it looks like a snake-human chimera , from a religious pov it 's ... unsettling . 
  somehow i read the title as `` classical music performer '' .

  ** italy ** [ bakar mockery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bakar_mockery ) , 1918 an italian navy commando attempted an incursion into the [ bay of bakar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bay_of_bakar ) ( then austro-hungaric ) . 
  while a tactical failure the attempt was successfully used to boost the low italian morale caused by the [ battle of caporetto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_caporetto ) . 
  most important , it showed the austro-hungarian incapability to detect seaborne enemy raiders , lowering the troops morale and causing an increased displacement of troops in the area , removing them from the much more active frontlines in the alpine regions .
