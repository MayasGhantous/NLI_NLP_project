  trading agreements frameworks are already negotiated at a central european level . 
  where , and at whom expense ? 
  greek islands are too close to the mainland , and let 's be honest , corrupting a random fisherman is far from impossible . 
  yeah , terrorist groups are getting short on radioactive and chemical weapons . 
  collapse russia , pretty please : *, 
   i do n't think people who ` hate the eu ' will make good partners for the future . 
  they will , better then with a lenient eu . 
  having a strong eu means having more negotiating power . 
  one could argue that strong eu = bad , but from the eu pov strong ue = good ( duh ) . 
  a strong eu has a stronger voices against corporation , like it or not . 
  18500 billions ( eu ) have more power then 3350 ( de ) . 
  the latter , he 's quite successful but apparently he is considered average at best on a technical level . 
  the late [ pavarotti ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs-p1oevugg ) , of course . 
  [ andrea bocelli ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4zfmxe_8og ) is also quite popular , but he 's more of a pop singer then classical , strictly speaking .

  gassing jews was 100 % legal at the time ... 
  and germans are the ones that continue fighting when all hope is lost , for 2 more years ( or 4,5 year , from a strategic pov ) . 
  tbh titan salvage ( us ) was the company that did most of the work . 
  renzi is mainly interested in obtaining more financial and economic independence/leeway , a goal which the uk shares . 
  shut up , portugal . 
  really useful zooms on liechtenstein and the french territories :p, 
  this is just cold war-like tactics , showing off muscles to avoid real conflicts . 
  with this kind of combat readiness the conflict would escalate to nuclear war , which noone wants , so no actual conflict is likely to start . 
  well , this kind of softcore is quite common here ... 
  i hope that proposed law does n't pass . 
  that 's indeed a huge ass fine . 
  are they simply putting higher fines for slander or have i missed something ? 
  this does n't seem as apocalyptic as the title makes it to be . 
  for people with italian roots , yes . 
  normally you need to reside in italy for 10 years to claim citizenship , which afaik is higher then most countries . 
  italy has a significant amount of argentinians and brazilians with italian roots . 
  i wo n't go into detail , but some of them can claim italian citizenship , and being a poor italian is better then a poor south american . 
  and , believe it or not , employment is easier here then in a lot of places in brazil . 
  late to the party but the answer is this : until really few years ago numbing gas was illegal , so more people used cesarean , and now the trend remains . 
  i am honestly positively surprised of italy 's situation . 
  have you tried cooking spray ? 
  and sadly there is still too little political will to cut youth unemployment and * under * employment , with the former simply ignored . 
  italy is also one of the few western nations with no basic income . 
  italy has the lowest eu percentage of people with tertiary grade education ( 24 % , eu average 38 % ) . 
  a lot of these few qualified people is also getting employed in other better paying eu states , this would be fine if the state was to be attractive to foreign qualified people , but low starting and median wages ( 50 % average , with some engineering areas paying more then double in northern eu ) makes the balance negative . 
  i do n't see this trend changing in the near future , most politicians focus on short term measures to appeal to the voter masses :  40 year old, 
  i found that 2 % milk + butter is perfect in a tomato tuna sauce . 
  wait a second ... you 're not european !, 
  great to see democracy at work . 
  i have two questions : about 1 ) and 6 ) , what is the current system ?

  the oranges used there are n't food grade , sicilian orange plantations sell them to the organization instead of throwing them away or using them as a low profitable compost .

  cosa nostra was really violent in the late 80 's early 90 's , now it 's both not the most powerful anymore and is mainly focused on state official corruption . 
  calabria has its own flavor of mafia : * ` ndrangheta * . 
  naples area would also be dark blue now , high rank bosses got captured recently and the power vacuum is causing bloody fights to obtain control .

  croatia has cheap vacation on the adriatic with same if not better quality then italy 's , and venice is a ferry travel away . 
  at least we do n't drown our bread in * italian * oil , and we make wine from the masses , not for ceos . 
  what was that revolution about ? 
  i really like your pop music , it 's arguably better then ours tho . 
  same as the single cup ones , just take care to always have a tight gasket and the filter should never `` sink '' but have a very tight fit . 
  replacement for both are pretty cheap . 
  1-2-4-8 cups are the most common and have the cheaper replacement parts . 
  thanks german shops for cheap electronics . 
  no money , but military power . 
   wasting disproportional much time on difficult to get taxes and not enough on the economic crisis \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  they 're poor , they folded a [ costa rica flag ] ( https://i.imgur.com/g99wl4k.png ) in two to save money .

  hm , snowball with tomato sauce inside ... brb, 
  worded poorly , but i agree . 
  far < insert flavour  will never be any good for a country . 
  politics is an art of compromise . 
  interesting , can you give me the circumference of their cranium ? 
  i need it for a very scientific thing . 
  what have the southern states to gain from this ? 
  as of now it 's just a shower of `` must , can , should '' , until the governments agreed to a compromise the situation will stall . 
   secured their freedom after agreeing to pay their norwegian victim $ 30,000 . 
   such out-of-court settlements are common in croatia . 
  creepy, 
  hah , tell that to the agricultural lobbies . 
  it 's more of a catholic/center leaning , the clearly right and left wing are balanced . 
  politics are geographically polarized here , ( ie : milan tends to be right , turin left , bologna left , trento left , genoa right ... ) . 
  if you went to italy for work you 'll probably were either in lombardy or veneto , their metropolitan areas have been historically right leaning . 
  here 's the main newspaper political orientation : - corriere della sera - central , liberal - la repubblica - left - il sole 24 ore - economic , liberal - quotidiano nazionale - umbrella name for 3 papers . 
  slightly left , mostly neutral - la gazzetta dello sport - sports , neutral - la stampa - left - il messaggero - neutral - corriere dello sport-stadio - sports , neutral - il giornale - right - avvenire - catholic , conservative . 
  supports whomever favors the vatican - tuttosport - sports - libero - right - italia oggi - economic , liberal - il gazzettino - conservative , slightly right - il fatto quotidiano - left - il secolo xix - catholic , supports whomever favors the vatican - il tirreno - slightly left , mostly neutral - il mattino - neutral 5 left , 4 right , 7 neutral , 2 catholic, 
  well , to be fair the lynx is simply a vehicle , not a weapon system like a warship . 
  more or less that , if you compare a carnival to brazil 's everything is a toned down version . 
  still : venice has the most [ colorful costumes ] ( http://www.hotelsalute.com/images/carnevale-venezia/carnevale-venezia-02.jpg ) and [ elaborate masks ] ( http://chiesaviaggi.it/viagginbus/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1329590980046carnevale_di_venezia2.jpg ) . 
  viareggio has parades with [ this kind of chariots ] ( http://viareggio.ilcarnevale.com/imageserver/home_slide/files/immagini/home-slide-def/carnevale12.jpg ) ivrea has the [ battle of the oranges ] ( http://medalp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ivrea.png ) in other cities it 's basically an excuse to go out and eat mountains of calories with no regrets . 
  most big centers have parades , and food , a lot of delicious fried food . 
  ** ie : ** shit hit a jet turbine down in those people 's countries of origin . 
  before the bulk was males in search of fortune for themselves ant their family , now it 's a free for all . 
  also , males and females are frequently not separated and facilities are barely capable of handling all these people . 
  ah well , a week surely is a perfect indicator of trends , what a crap article .
