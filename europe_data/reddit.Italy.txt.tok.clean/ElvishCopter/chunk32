  it 's not a poor area , there 's just nothing to do there . 
  football is virtually non-existent , baseball slightly more popular but basketball is one of the most popular in the south and balkans . 
  no , it 's / r/superbowl, 
  pope * frank * seems like a chill dude . 
  - italy gave green light for the 3bn to turkey - the pm finally got a long range jet ( a340 ) which will cut travel times significantly . 
  the past plane ( a319 ) required 2 refuelings for trips to east asia . 
  the a340 can be anywhere in the world with a single full tank . 
  - an italian doctorate student and journalist was found dead with signs of torture in egypt . 
  egyptian police tried to mask his death as a car accident . 
  this mo is common when egyptian security forces want to silence `` unwelcome '' people . 
  ok , i know close to nothing about india . 
  ^ ^ this ^ ^ conversation ^ ^ never ^ ^ happened . 
  polish pegida ( vanilla flavoured ), 
  why not go living in central mumbai ? 
  it costs too much . 
  dammit . 
  still , italy 's always been the last wheel of the wagon . 
  good play by our guys . 
  it 's not really possible to pinpoint an area , there are [ dozens of dialects ] ( https://i.imgur.com/xvwwrid.png ) for each region , each one with notable different pronunciations . 
  i guess it 's close to some areas in the po valley central zone , which is indeed italy 's wealthiest . 
  homeless shelters are a grouping of troubled people , they are often less safe then the streets , were the personal space is bigger . 
  italian has an hard `` r '' that becomes a light `` v '' , they generally talk with pursed lips and the voice is a bit nasal . 
  [ this guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbncd-q3ywo ) has the typical snobbish pronounce . 
  in the eurozone , if you put uk in the picture italy becomes 4th . 
  that 's not accurate , there have been cases reported [ since 2014 ] ( http://www.adnkronos.com/salute/sanita/2016/02/05/virus-zika-istituto-superiore-sanita-casi-italia-dal_wzqnhcaxewdtlvhhdukefi.html ) in italy . 
  you ca n't see us !, 
  hehehhe, 
  what 's the problem ? 
  if you 're poor you just have to earn more !, 
  asgvrfr make up ? 
  inb4 `` ship them back ''  an estimated 4.7 % of women affected by fgm , and also girls born to mothers who had undergone fgm , at 10.4 % well , the silver lining is that in a generation it 's more then halved . 
  are you hawaiian ? 
  that 's a huge ass amount of spam right there !, 
  quoting myself from the [ first time this was posted ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/43z4sd/african_family_shown_how_to_use_toilet_in_their/ ) :  this is not a newspiece , it 's a mashup .

  is there any other humor ? 
  oh my , not putting jews over everything and being pro immigration . 
  you chose the wrong sub for that propaganda image . 
  oh , come on , do you have any idea how hard it is to corrupt a government official with 200 $ banknotes ? 
  i ca n't fit my 150000 $ in an envelope . 
  500 $ are just so handy . 
  good luck getting a net gain from that . 
  just did a quick googling , http://www.thetrainline-europe.com/ looks pretty handy . 
  for the hostel question you 'll probably be luckier if you ask for hostel info on the national subreddits ( / r/netherlands , r/poland , ... ), 
  oh come on , he just extended the trend lines without factoring in a change in the economical scenario . 
  1980 was a totally different world then 2010 .

  but classical italian ingredients are far more expensive in canada then italy . 
  the selection is also scarcer , you can find dozens of pasta varieties in a small shop here , while in canada you obviously find more ingredients for the local cuisine . 
  more often then not threats mean that 's the risk is fake , but of course you ca n't risk ignoring them . 
  i just hope that this an empty threat and the alarmist gets thrown into jail . 
  high standard of living , easier legal immigration process then the us . 
  mediocre food . 
  and say fuck all to diplomatic protection ? 
  this is not a life or death situation like the iranian embassy . 
  you do n't want me to get mad ... serious : in italian it 's called a * fondo pensione * ( pension fund ) . 
  ukraine saw rebel forces hugely reinforced by russia , baltic states have less extreme minorities . 
  also , ukraine is out of nato while baltic states are in , and attacking any nato member would trigger every other 's reaction . 
   thanks for keeping it real . 
  just telling like it is , there 's nothing to romanticize in careless exploitation of people . 
   thanks for keeping it real . 
  eni , an italian oil company with italian linked industry , was a ( the ? ), 
  major player in the libyan oil business , and for a lot of expensive infrastructure projects italians business were called . 
  business gets worse in the short term , but on the grand scheme of things the economy grows , so creating a power vacuum allows for other actors to have a chance to be influential . 
  i 'd like to reiterate that these are just speculations , albeit realistic . 
  both really , being the closest rich european nation and having `` implanted '' italians from colonization times helped keeping business relationship alive even after the war . 
  a fourth of libya 's exports are directed to italy . 
  the fall of qaddafi * , the tribal conflicts that exploded due to the lack of a strong central power and daesh finding fertile ground have caused a major contraction in trades in later years . 
  some oil facilities are still active , but direct maintenance and oversight from italian personnel have been scarcer and harder due to safety threats . 
  intelligence forces and relationships are probably the strongest of any other country due to italy 's interests in there . 
  on the cultural side there 's never really been any significant exchange , libya was just `` used '' . 
  * : some say that the french push in qaddafi 's elimination was due to their interests in causing chaos and inserting themselves as an useful/attractive partner . 
  you ca n't mess with us if we fuck ourselves up first . 
  my shaved eritrean flatland is hungry for your bratwurst . 
  u me sex now, 
  they 're not mutually exclusive . 
  asimilation that leads to integration ? 
  * are you mental ? 
  the [ majority of africans ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/static/infografica/mondo-solidale/20151027_migranti/05-.gif ) coming to italy are actual refugees , that 's why . 
  ( this shows nationality declared at arrival , but you ca n't fake black skin , so it 's reliable in this context ) . 
  consider that we have a [ 40 % first asylum request acceptance rate ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:first_instance_decisions_by_outcome_and_recognition_rates,_3rd_quarter_2015.png ) ( which is low when compared to the eu average ) . 
  this means that most refused instances are not african . 
   yezidis ironically they are the ones remaining there . 
  i meant to imply politicians from the netherlands are among the most vocal against greece . 
   ~ ~ $ 5,450 ~ ~ $ 5000 that 's pretty much in line with italy 's limit of 3000 $ , when adjusted for gdp/capita . 
  i hope they succeed on applying the limit . 
   we have no foreign policy . 
  not exactly , being the major player in libya has been a focus since qaddafi . 
  italy 's has also been proactive in getting in contact with iran again after the nuclear deal was looking successful . 
  the current government is also strengthening relationship with the senegal and eritrea , both for economic deals and to cull the arrival of migrants . 
  on the military part : italy is the nato country with the most troops in lebanon and it 's going to be the 2nd in iraq by personnel . 
  there 's no china or turkey in the world ranking , but japan is there . 
  it 's kind of a badly written report without considering them . 
  you 'll fit right in apulia , they just dismantled a stolen auto ring . 
  the market 's open again baby . 
  go tell that to a good part of the netherlands politicians & politicians with the same views . 
  it 's all someone else 's fault . 
   stunning video footage of a family of newly arrived africans being shown how to use the toilet in their new flat contrasts with shocking news from sweden of a local man freezing to death after being evicted from his flat , this is not a newspiece , it 's a mashup .
