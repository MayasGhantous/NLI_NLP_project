  they need to have more little magyars up there . 
  does the state has enough to afford this ? 
  i understand that hungary has a low debt/gdp but still , it 's hard to cull state debt , it almost only goes down with economy growth . 
  gdp growth has been stagnant , i hope that these pro family measures are accompanied by strong pro economy measures . 
  anyway , best of luck .

  the hanging scene was n't part of the original act : he was supposed to be `` killed '' with a gunshot , but it was changed into an hanging at the last moment .

  i do n't quite understand the critics in this thread . 
   as a land power , russia is inherently vulnerable napoleon and hitler beg to differ, 
  because the eu gas signed international treaties , and it does n't ignore those like ... china and the us do .

  you quoted a study on tech company , not an extensive one , that argumentation is n't valid . 
  srambled egg with little cubes of onion and tomato sauce . 
  mixed it with 1 coffee spoon of extra virgin olive oil , 1 coffee spoon of sunflower seed oil and a sprinkle of refined sugar .

  please no , child of people after 40 have a considerable higher risk of mental and physical illnesses . 
  people live longer but the ideal conception range is still between 20 up to 35 . 
  putting aside the extreme level of error for this kind of projection , italy and most western countries need immigration . 
  most of europe have already families with less then 1.5 children , and with higher life expectancy older people will be a burden too high to sustain . 
  we should aspire to a controlled migration and multiculturalism on the level of the us or canada .

  here 's the full top 20 , i suppose this is the one andrus was referring to : https://i.imgur.com/tpqftvx.png  one important caveat to note : our index does not currently include startup ecosystems from china , taiwan , japan , and south korea . 
  it has been challenging to get survey participants and complete data . 
  we hope to have these ecosystems included in our index later this year . 
  while we have not completed our analysis yet , we particularly expect :  beijing to rank in the top 5  shanghai to rank in the top 15 [ source ] ( http://blog.compass.co/the-2015-global-startup-ecosystem-ranking-is-live/ ),

  afaik our government is still blocking the 3bn to help turkey handle migrants . 
  the gov is arguing on the source of those money . 
  admittedly i 've not looked into it too much , i just know that the money is n't going to turkey . 
  tell that to turkey and italy . 
  turkey because of the secular rivalry with greece , and italy because for whatever damn reason is blocking the deal that was reached not so long ago . 
  finally ourt chart is not an anglo egemony .

  italy and spain have comparable energy sources , our energy and facilities companies saw the profit potential from green energy and that report shows it . 
  i ca n't see how their business can be so anti ... themselves . 
  they are shooting themselves in the foot . 
  what 's up wih spain ? 
  they have a massive renewables potential . 
  but it 's used as such in public debates , having it officially disproved would neutralize the danger ( or usefulness ) of the paper . 
   you 'd have to fly in-between the two communicating satellites within that accuracy , which is basically impossible . '', 
  but flying a stealth aircraft between the ground station and the satellite will break that security feature , that 's why they 're encrypting the communication .
