  that 's italian lawmaking on science for you . 
  the entire research area is both underfunded and misguided . 
  the animation sector is globally dominated by both the ones you listed , so an european sub wo n't really have enough content to stay alive . 
  a migrant housing location was opened in the outskirts of the city i live the past year , but that 's it . 
  one could argue that the reason is freedom to decide who can cross a border . 
  yay-ish , now it 's compromised . 
  seems in line with the country 's corruption . 
  nations with gendarmery forces have that aspect somewhat already covered . 
  paywalled :(, 
  whoa , electric tree . 
  what field are you in ? 
  milan 's strong points are engineering/architecture/design, 
  ha , we beat germany . 
  like increased police/troops on the street , they act mainly as a tranquilizer . 
  prevention is the key , once a terrorist is on the street he 'll just click and boom . 
  either you put police near every single group of 10 or more people or a level of risk will always exist . 
  government : 5 years duration officially , de facto it 's 1.12 years on average ( 63rd government since 1948 ) president of the republic : 7 years officially , 5.8 on average . 
  if you want to kill time and trust in humanity just follow italian politics . 
  populist side : elimination of first house taxes . 
  this made city governments anemic and with consequences that are still felt after reparation reforms . 
  penal code : accounting fraud no longer a crime leading to incarceration ( the current government reintroduced incarceration for this , luckily ) international relationships : closer ties with putin 's russia and deals with qaddafi to block migrants in lybia . 
  i ca n't recall , i only remember that the thought train leading to it had an homer magnet on my right speaker and folk music . 
  they are content to take the debtor 's life as a collateral . 
  2015 as a whole saw 9 % less migrant landings then 2014 , for italy . 
  take a look at [ this ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/solidarieta/immigrazione/2016/01/07/news/flussi_migratori_12_mesi_di_sbarchi_in_europa-130787694/ ), 
  his first legislature lasted less than a year , and it took him 7 years to get elected again . 
  he handled the financial crisis incredibly poorly , refusing to take measures for almost a year only to resign at the peak of the crisis . 
  his second and fourth were the lasting ones were he was able to leave his mark . 
  you 've got the easiest one . 
  bungabunga was the lesser problem , he used politics to help himself and his criminal friends . 
  just from memory i can remember that 3 of his lawyers have a seat in parliament . 
  renzi is in favor of multiple tiers of eu integration , specifically in the economic and finance `` elasticity '' sides . 
  migration reform is not a priority for this government because a ) influx in italy is diminishing b ) he is pushing for already heated reforms on civil unions and various tax and financial reforms . 
  i forgot about them , they reached 2 % in 2014 . 
  not that italy produces 17 % of eurofighters and none of the rest , it 's for your own good * ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ your ^ ^ ^ family 's *, 
  suicide fact : if lithuania and poland were one state the suicide rate would be 4 steps higher ( 16th -  12th ) . 
  consider that lithuania has just 7,5 % of poland population . 
  because the netherlands know best , at least that 's what the proposal looks like . 
  poor belgium , even film enthusiasts consider them irrelevant . 
  i ca n't see how anyone in the west could be against nato , i fail to see any drawbacks for countries in this continent . 
  sources ? 
  even if biased , i 'd like to read them . 
  please tell me that at least you did your research on this . 
  side note : the government and the reception people are blaming each other over who gave the order to cover the statues . 
  60 $ for 240km is n't really too much if he checked for something better then a beaten-up train . 
  france also gave asylum to an [ italian terrorist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marina_petrella ) . 
  if all the important people at the table are n't muslim it 's possible , alcohol is not illegal for non-muslims . 
  does he bring 17 billions in trade agreements with him ? 
  it 's called respecting your visitor . 
  if it 's asked to have/not to have x you respect the desire . 
  corruption data for the eu just came out . 
  bulgaria is the most corrupted , they need to waste money somewhere . 
  i 'd bet ( illegally ) on the eurofighter . 
  if we use nato 's target spending of 2 % gdp only great britain , greece and estonia are complying . 
  they have elective judges and sheriffs , this method alone rises corruption regardless of the level of honesty in a country . 
  something something powerball . 
  yay , we surpassed lesotho !, 
  translation ( technical terms translated literally ) :  a deal over suffering banks has been reached in the eu , said minister of treasury pier carlo padoan after a meeting with eu 's vestager . 
  `` we reached a deal with the commission over an warranty method to deal with suffering institutes '' , after a five and a half hour meeting with vestager . 
  it 's a securitization of suffering financial assets which will enhance the measures already actuated . 
  `` technical details will be finalized in hours '' , he added that this deal is `` a bit more complex '' then a state aid . 
  it 's `` an really useful incentivisation to speed the process '' . 
   `` eu 's commission is pleased to have reached a deal with padoan over the set of rules to establish a framework to sustain italy 's non performing loans '' said the secretary of competition margrethe vestager , `` these warranties are priced at marked conditions to avoid them being state aids '' . 
  `` with more reforms italy should enhance the ability of banks to create loans for the real market '' . 
  sooo ... unplanned sex does n't count . 
  loophole uncovered . 
  i 've only used ones in northern italy train stations , they were well kept . 
  ssssh do n't interrupt the circlejerk . 
  it 's cheaper to repurpose cold war era barracks and other abandoned buildings than building the infrastructure from scrap . 
  in italy , at least . 
  it 's also worth noting that camps in lebanon and turkey are essentially fenced areas filled with tents . 
  covering potentially offensive statues during visits from foreign delegations is a common proactive move for the current government . 
  they are pushing for russia and ukraine to implement the minsk accord signed last year , i 've not read any news on the relaxation of those terms . 
  incompetent financial administration and one of the most corrupt governments give you that . 
  afaik italy was iran 's main partner before the nuclear sanctions . 
  xp is from 2001 , 15 years is still pretty young in the military equipment world . 
  b2 stealth bombers are from the 80s , better scrap 'em, 
  i 'll generalize even more : the west sucks , putin is a savior !, 
  debt does n't disappear . 
  making shareholders and investors pay for it is as fair as it can be , they are partial owners of the bank 's wealth after all . 
  public help puts the weight either on sovereign debt , and italy does n't need more of it , or on taxpayers that have n't invested 1 cent on the troubled institute . 
  it 's more of a bisexual thing , we usually go with the most attractive one . 
  the river 's side does n't matter . 
  let 's just say that us are n't the pinnacle of balanced severity of punishments for breaking the law . 
   the answer is to create a `` bad bank '' to absorb these loans , so that the rest of the system can be restored to health and serve its essential purpose of lending in support of economic growth tell the eu to make this possible , our economists are trying to find a loophole to make this possible . 
  when the alternative is destruction of your homeland switching sides does become attractive . 
  so , a single person now becomes plural ? 
  telegraph , you got a leak , good for you , but do n't conflate the situation beyond what 's reasonable . 
  it gets lower the higher rank you are . 
  cinnamon is better . 
  interesting fact : here it 's 13 ** if ** the other partner is younger then 16 . 
  there is a social stigma if an adult has sex with a minor though , even if both are consenting . 
  so the 10 candidates were just trying to go for it , good to see that the country is n't as divided . 
  let 's not lie to ourselves , kurds are discriminated , but a. . . generous amount of them is extremist . 
  finland will supply territory ( to russia ) . 
   a filter that would get rid of that https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3j79ef/ann_topic_filters_for_reurope_are_here/ this guy created a gresemonkey filter exactly for that . 
  i was watching tv ( did n't have satellite yet ) and got annoyed because every channel with interesting content was reporting the attacks . 
  i ended up watching some crappy documentary . 
  yours is more interesting . 
  and ~ ~ 3/4 ~ ~ 7/8s of italian ones .
