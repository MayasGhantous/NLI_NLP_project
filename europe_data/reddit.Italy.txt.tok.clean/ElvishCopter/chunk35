  i do n't really like bananas , but i need the potassium ... kazaaaakstan . 
  well , it 's hardly fighting when the objective is * not * to get hit . 
  yay !, 
  wait a second ... 
  - quarter finals of a football game . 
  coach a started ranting against coach b and called him a faggot . 
  - our banking sector went into deep sea diving -  a rally opposing the family day , an annual event promoting the idea of a `` traditional family '' , and against gay marriage and the so-called `` gender ideology '' . 
  what is more , roberto maroni , the president of lombardy and member of the conservative party lega nord , lit up the pirellone , the headquarters of the region , to promote the event . 
  that brought about lots of criticism , and arguably increased the number of the demonstrators in [ piazza della scala ] ( http://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/scala-1.jpg ) today [ c/p from / u/thesecretsalmon post [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/42bnmr/people_in_piazza_della_scala_milan_demonstrating/cz92jyc ) ] lombardy region building lit up in support of `` family day '' [ here ] ( https://i.imgur.com/1avnqhj.png ) naples * piazza del plebiscito * supporting civil unions [ here ] ( http://www.repstatic.it/content/localirep/img/rep-napoli/2016/01/23/192114263-24665b93-a86d-4770-9741-52138a50065d.jpg ) . 
  noted . 
  i have n't , is it worth watching ? 
  i hate the italian comedy genre . 
  [ 63 % of imports ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/import/gbr/show/all/2013/ ) and [ 55 % of exports ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/gbr/show/all/2013/ ) do n't really put the uk `` alone '' . 
  that 's half the story , a numbing gas commonly used to ease conception has been illegal in italy until really recently . 
  i did n't mean to , i just think that they 're distorting the use of a word . 
  i found it mildly entertaining , that 's all . 
  grassroots implies that the movement is mostly spontaneous , prominent figures starting and pushing it from the start on mass media is hardly so . 
  a really rough estimate i made gives ~ 9000 people, 
  i do n't follow us politics enough to make an informed statement . 
  what i can say is that , by what i know , go has been launched by important politicians from its start , so i doubt the movement will have significant independence from its leadership . 
  i 'm not against go , but defining it as `` coming from the people '' is deception . 
  seems more like astroturfing to me , real grassroots do n't have an `` explosive '' start . 
  endorsed by national level politicians from day 0 , lel . 
  it 's moderately popular in northern italy , but we never had a international competition worthy team . 
  it 's more popular with female players , but that 's it . 
  oh yeah , even if we 're not a strong nation there 's some balkan player in the top leagues , i suppose because the pay it 's better here where there 's less competition . 
  we 'll coriolis your ass back to asia . 
   however , data transfers are allowed if firms set up complex legal structures such as binding corporate rules ** or standard contractual clauses . 
  ** ie : minor policy rewrite plus an additional paragraph in the eula that no one reads . 
  and the solution is abandon ship ? 
  ever thought of joining the navy ? 
  italian is the closest alive language to latin . 
  it 's essentially a simplified latin , meanwhile romanian has plenty slavic influences . 
   as a kabbalist hum , what 's that ? 
   kabbalah ( hebrew : \u05e7\u05b7\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4 , literally `` receiving/tradition '' ) is an esoteric method , ah ok . 
   china and turkey and italy . 
  mind fart , nevermind . 
   i see nothing wrong here , what was the scandal about ? 
  italian tv news in a nutshell . 
  eh , italy is much more prone to act in international conflicts then the other you listed . 
  most nato missions saw significant italian presence . 
  [ pierluigi bersani ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/pier_luigi_bersani ) , politician . 
  some years ago media tried to create a scandal with [ this picture ] ( http://www.corriere.it/media/foto/2012/01/20/bersa--620x420.jpg ) . 
   civil servants afaik the limit is 150 $, 
  ambiguity is exactly the problem . 
  obviously i 'm not french , but i think this level control from the state , which has no clear end in sight , collides with the freedom owed to its people . 
  unsurprising really , france is going full police state . 
  total security is simply impossible and this level of control is n't really helping anyone . 
  this seems more as an exercise to write x words then to create a coherent article . 
  til money are literally bombs . 
  '' * europe needs america * '' : please captain guatemala , help us !, 
  it describes europe problems without saying what the us must do , not even broadly . 
  this article want to picture the eu as a subject of the us . 
  crappy article . 
  name one country next to europe that would be both safe and cooperative . 
   but the glacial pace of action in the country means it is likely to flirt with disaster for a while yet . 
  utterly idiotic , it 's a parmigiano threatening action against pornhub all over again . 
  * buff tights camp . 
  just hope that they do n't do like our government : the one time password get sent half by sms and the other half ... snail mail . 
  so he adds a layer of complexity and cost over the existing method , i 'm not sure if it 's a good idea . 
  oh well , thanks for your time . 
  thanks . 
  he has n't accounted for ballot privacy , even an hypothetical perfectly secure system ca n't account for an individual leaning over the person entering the vote . 
  about counting : the current method of counting votes is done with oversight form parties with opposing interests , so it 's as fair as it can be . 
  the slowness of the traditional vote a real effective defense against an attack scalability . 
  electronic vote is doable , albeit prone to machine rigging : the location of the vote is secure . 
  online , not so much . 
  i would love to see online voting , but until the above problems are solved it would mean a step backwards in the certainty of a vote authenticity . 
  well , the first is a pretty nice feat of engineering at least . 
  that 's depressingly bleak , ex-soviet cities are `` excused '' . 
  that city looks ... hopeless . 
  100 % agree , i 've already voiced my worry about vote security in this same thread indeed . 
  and votes over traditional mail suffer from pretty much the same problem : one thing is for a citizen abroad to go to a safe location ( embassy , consulate ) to cast their ballot , another is to use traditional mail , which can be as easily intercepted . 
  fingerprint identification + a single use pin should do the trick . 
  the tricky part would be vote secrecy , with remote voting you ca n't be sure that the voter was not seen . 
  why not electronic then ?

  interesting , i 've only a minor complaint : some profession will always have a gender disparity , i do n't hear anyone cry over the lack of male nurses . 
  oh ok , the exposure in op 's tricked me . 
  it would suck to have an expensive central apartment next to it . 
  i hope that the skyscrapers next to it are only offices . 
   more than 4 million tons of cadmium , copper , lead , nickel , arsenic , selenium and zinc are released into the air every year .

  [ gomorra , which for some reason got translated into `` gomorr ** h ** a '' . 
  ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/gomorrha_%e2%80%93_reise_in_das_reich_der_camorra ), 
  yup, 
  it 's hard , but manageable . 
  a parent would just needs to fill a form with the specific allergies or , if privacy is a concern , select a `` safe meal '' option while enrolling the child . 
  if a state runs soup kitchens the situation should be already covered by the mandatory exposition of the food 's ingredients . 
   `` hey you !, 
  adopt my morality ! '', 
  it 's more like `` hey you , follow the law '' . 
  affordable healthcare for anyone is a constitutional right , so the option of affordable treatment for important ( read , * non aesthetic * treatment ) must be available . 
  a balanced compromise could be that for any x people and/or y area abort must be provided . 
   what would be considered actionable ` insults ' , exactly ? 
  the definition is cloudy , but any negative statement against religion/a public institution/armed forces without an explicit critic could qualify . 
   an article on a high-ranking government official that happens to denounce him as a ` crook ' , etc , would be less actionable than a paid ad from a disgruntled citizen calling his neighbor the same ?
