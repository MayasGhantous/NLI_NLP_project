  yes and no , once can talk about about details of a public figure life more freely then a mr. anyone , but any court sentence or inquiry for any member of the parliament needs the green light from a special council , even if the sentence is definitive . 
  our legislature has both thought crime and a shield against legal actions taken against any member of parliament . 
  i think that hospitals meeting certain criteria should be mandated to offer complete abortion services . 
  the imposition would be on the company , not the individual . 
  what a ridiculous cause of concern , just make meals tailored for consumption by people with the most common intolerances/allergies a mandatory option and forget the pig war .

  uhm , it could be interpreted as * vilipendio * . 
  the worst case scenario would be a fine ranging from 5000 $ up to 20000 $ in this situation . 
  action is de facto taken only when a false declaration or personal insults towards live people are made . 
  so : harsh criticism from some people with a really remote chance of a 5000-20000 $ fine .

  while legal she had mountains of obstacles to overcome . 
  that 's illegal here :(,

  transnational transport will take more time , hence cost more . 
  for comparison , naples . 
  i dare you to go to scampia . 
  and they 're virtually all italian there . 
  it 's more like a fallen empire syndrome where some people like to look at the glories of the past , but there 's not a russian or english level of nostalgia .

  well , he has been proven right . 
  the first one contains mainly lighthearted messages and this one is getting criticized and downvoted .

  maybe if you ( as german government ) did n't thwart the construction of a second pipeline italy might have avoided blocking the 3bn for turkey ^ ^ ^ r/conspiracy . 
  rigorous with the south but lavish with the north ... 
  well , turkey is far from a paradise . 
  interesting use of hdr . 
  i 'm puzzled by the double traffic sign in front of the alte kommandatur . 
  more like 28 to 30 averages in our south . 
  and we 're still cold when compared to spain or greece . 
  i do n't think this will lead to a race to the bottom , those breaks will end on december 31t . 
  i would agree if you doubted the existence of a long term effect from the measure .

  italy gave tax breaks , which seems like a more reasonable measure . 
  they are our neighbor after all , oh wait ... 
  i 'm too lazy to go look for it , are they called ionian because of the ionian sea ? 
  that 's quite an unique twist . 
  * welcome to our world . 
  well , from an egoistic pov italy has gotten better everyday on the migrant influx every month , even when comparing with the same month of 2014 . 
  europe decided to wake up only when the `` big guys '' got their share of migrants , we 've been saying this for years . 
  yep , me too , and italy is supposed to shift into romania . 
  while op puts us in spain . 
  no offense to romanians , but spain is better . 
  i admittedly have limited knowledge on statistics , i do have a question : are telephonic interviews a good instrument ? 
  fyi : this is the only hard data on evolution of sexual assault with geographical separation i could find , source is the italian national institute of statistics : http://www.istat.it/it/archivio/5173 ( first download show results , second presents the methodology ) . 
  sampling took place in 2008-2009 , it compares sexual assault percentages in a woman 's life to assaults in the 3 years before the analysis . 
  if i understood it correctly i have to partially retract from my position , even tough a cause for it is not mentioned . 
  other data i found focuses only on victim 's nationality and does n't mention the aggressor 's . 
  it 's the opposite , i understood this representation scope as : `` put nth country by area in nth country by population '' . 
  netherlands is 33rd by area and moldova 33rd by population , so netherlands shifts into moldova . 
  maltese looks like sardinian dialect . 
  edit : forgot how adjectives works . 
  you heathen , kebab religion is supreme !, 
  there 's no freedom without education , but the latter does n't imply the former . 
  edit : look at saudi arabia in recent years : more woman are getting degrees but they are still under total control of the male guardians . 
  of course we end up in a country with higher young unemployment . 
  the tourism money is nice though . 
  yeah , netherlands should be in moldova and italy into romania ... 
  i like op 's version more tho . 
  do you have any evidence or are you pulling this out of your ass ? 
  let 's not joke ourselves , italy has n't really been northern european safe . 
  1 year `` italian crime rate '', 
  i was arguing the validity of `` eu migrant policy = rapes '' . 
  people waiting for their case to be processed are evened out in all of italy and are housed in special residences but are n't obliged to stay there 24/7 we have cie ( ** c ** entro ** i ** dentificazione ed ** e ** spulsione - centers for identification and explulsion ) for illegal aliens processing , but only if they actually get caught . 
  about your second point : the main migrant problem lies with people whose asylum request got rejected , they are handed a paper with `` italy no allow , bby '' and not taken into custody . 
  most of those end out either doing black market jobs or selling drugs . 
  but generally that kind of people keep a low profile , so criminality did n't rise noticeably . 
  immigrant criminality rate got lower in recent years really . 
  source ? 
  the answer is not that simple : 70 % of migrants coming to italy in 2015 are northern african , and yet there have been no mass sexual assaults on new year 's night . 
  we get the bulk version of migrant immigration , the ones coming to france are already `` filtered '' . 
  and most of our are economic migrants from central africa .
