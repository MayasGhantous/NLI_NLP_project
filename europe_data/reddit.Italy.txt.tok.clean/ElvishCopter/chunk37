  ftfy, 
  [ page screenshot . 
  i misread it as `` clown proof street '' , i like my version better . 
  the author seems to hold a grudge towards sweden , no other city got such a negative review . 
  ** tl ; dr ** lack of competition . 
  preface : the dates i put are when something happened * de facto * , implementation of new rules takes a lot here . 
  there was a monopoly on the telephonic lines until 2001 , so there was no pressure to modernize the infrastructure . 
  new lines can be built by everyone now , but few are actually laid because of both the low profitability and the ex-monopoly business tries to block as much as legally possible . 
  until 2010 there was no control on the lease cost charged to new isps , so not only the old infrastructure saw both little development , but new isps were blocked from offering speeds at least equal to what the state isp was offering . 
  since 2009 or so fiber optics has been laid down at a faster rate then before , but since profitability is scarce for rural areas those are often ignored . 
  a lot of the italian population is not concentrated into big cities , so this left a lot of people with old copper lines with distribution cabinets away from them , so even a 10mb adsl is a luxury in a lot of places . 
  enter 2015 : a state plan for actual increase of broadband coverage is finally written , but it still mainly focused on major population centers and with no competition stimulating measures , leaving the future of a lot of people quite bleak . 
  well , there are plans for 300 mbps for around 60 canadian $ here too , but they cover only the 3 main northern cities . 
  everywhere else speed are a third for at least double the price/mb . 
  italy is the second worst country in europe for 10mbps and higher coverage , and on top of that providers charge quite a lot . 
  money , most of the time is the answer . 
  from a business point of view it 's worth taking in workers from countries poorer then most of europe , they settle for lower wages and are easier to control . 
  philippines are $ 7250 gdp/capita , the only european countries lower then that are moldova and kosovo , and they are both small in population and healthcare worker formation . 
  something tells me that people eat dinner at 19:00 there . 
  and apparently your submission was removed for being a `` duplicate '' , lol ... this sub is kinda going down the drain and the alternatives are even more rid of far right wingers . 
  generally speaking every show , even older ones , were always in italian . 
  when the state had still a monopoly on tv they used it as a way to gently force italian on a population with really high illiteracy ( 25 % in some southern regions in the 1950s ) and to reduce the education divide . 
  50s italy had piedmont with 3 % illiteracy and calabria with 32 % , tv has been a cornerstone in uniting italy on a cultural level . 
  that influenced italian tv and general media to virtually eliminate dialect from mass media . 
  there are still some exceptions in modern days , every now and then a movie in dialect pops up . 
  gomorra is one of the latest that it 's mainly in dialect . 
  the dialect you hear on media is used for emphasis , and it 's never used in a formal scenario . 
  heh , if i really knew how i would n't be wasting time on reddit . 
  fyi : [ oecd data ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=health_stat ) shows 2-3 % higher values then the world bank . 
  dam you , it 's 40 $ / month for 30 mbit/s here . 
  few people talk completely in dialect now , mainly in rural areas and in some southern cities . 
  naples is probably the biggest city where dialect is commonly used in a heavy fashion . 
  you could hear older people talking in dialect to each other , but generally speaking people use at most an italian with lots of dialectal expression . 
  south tyrol is more austrian then italian , most border towns have better roads on the austrian border . 
  edit : forgot to end the sent, 
  tv is italian , even local stations . 
  i 'm not aware of of any `` dialect tv '' . 
  500,000 barrels is still a 16 % increase over current iranian production . 
  source : [ opec itself ] ( http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/163.htm ) ( crude oil production ), 
  they are doing this to leverage the eu into giving an higher deficit margin . 
  from a political pov it 's a smart move , the eu wants to sanction italy for having avoided fingerprinting every single migrant and is being strict on the debt/gdp ratio . 
  italy is blocking the 3bn to avoid allocating new funds specifically for the cause , they want the source of these money to be from a common european bucket . 
  at least this is what i understood . 
  the pope said < insert 3 minute clip  . 
  every single edition of a news programme . 
  -- winter is coming !, 
  look , there is snow on 2000 + meters mountains !, 
  the coldest winter !, 
  ^ ^ since ^ ^ 2014 -- mainstream media also love talking about `` mysterious '' murders that might have a passion reason , they were going all in with the story of a tourist killed by a mysterious man . 
  too bad they found a dna match few days after that , the killer was a drug dealer that went home with her . 
  you could almost touch the resentment in the tv announcer voices when they talked about it for the next 3 days after the match . 
  the usual mo is this : person killed , preferably a women . 
  media goes feral hunting and creates a `` mediatic '' process where they condemn a person that fits the story well , without actual proofs obviously . 
  the story is then dragged for weeks if not even years at times , with updates on any minimal progress or legal move and recaps when there 's nothing new . 
  another of their favorite card is * malasanit\u00e0 * ( medical malpractice ) cases when news programs like to throw crap on the hospital/healhtcare location that saw the case . 
  there are a lot of people in this sub that want a certain agenda pushed , it 's not unusual for a new post to receive a shower of downvotes in the first minutes . 
  the state has limited direct involvement , they mostly direct migrants to the various private agencies . 
  programs helping with refugee integration receive public founding so they do exist , the most common type is a cooperative business which offers at least one of the following : 1 . legal counseling , - `` cultural mediation '' ( ie : teach italian culture in a practical way ) - affordable housing - skill training - acts as a employment agency the most common coupling is 1-2 or 1-2-4, 
  that 's when the two cultures split , the statement gravity that leads to firing is higher in non english countries . 
  you 're talking as mr. misogynist , not as google ceo . 
  at least this is what often happens here . 
  the anglosphere has the borders between private and public life much more blurred in comparison with other countries . 
  that 's too south . 
  do n't quote me on this but i think it 's because europe has hefty customs fees on top . 
  if you want `` straight-from-taiwan '' now you can use alibaba , but quality can still be a shot in the dark with them . 
  you can always ask them to leave out the ingredients you dislike , it 's made on the spot after all . 
  oil , saudi arabia can continue to extract it for the next 50 years if they keep the actual extraction rate . 
  finally , it was stupid to be so hostile to one of the richest , most stable and relatively progressive nations in the middle east . 
  poland will be the cleaning guy . 
  the stenographer will be swiss . 
  when the policemen shift ends they will go to a french caf\u00e9 . 
  a greek barman will give belgian beer to the hungarian server giving refreshments to the austrian orchestra . 
  is it uncommon in uk politics to abstain from voting ? 
  in italy it 's not unusual , but our politics are dysfunctional . 
  laziness , updated it just because you asked : * thanks . 
  7 $ at the turk kebap place across the steet i live in . 
  ah yes , double the toppings that you see in the photo . 
  i was just trying to fit in :( typical finn, 
  going back in time to find any claim of success , typical swede . 
  self loathing is endemic here , but you 'll find that the society and general culture are really homogeneous here . 
  cultural nationalism , if you will . 
  the uk still was in the majority 87 % of the time . 
  without context this graph is gravely misleading . 
  uhm , the graph shows that small countries got what they wanted the majority of time . 
  eh , if india can get a satellite to mars at 11 % the price of nasa 's russia could get a nuclear carrier with 5.6 billions . 
  noone said that russia 's carrier will have the capabilities of a ford class carrier , only the energy source . 
  our government is doing this to put pressure on the eu and have more financial leeway , i doubt they 're completely opposed to the idea . 
  it 's not official but if you know italian politics it 's not hard to put two and two together . 
  fyi : the length of the italian detainment will be 7 years , if she is ever actually imprisoned . 
  ** europe ** ^ ^ somewhat ^ ^ comparatively ** stronk **, 
  0x2 = 0 / s, 
  just do what some other states do , put a loan in their name . 
  and if it 's not payed back or a tranche has been skipped banish them . 
  this will have the same effect without the questionable part . 
  everywhere really , french in perfume names sounds * chic * . 
  ha , here you need a clean criminal record and 2 psychological examinations just to get a license for sport weapons . 
  a finnish store should sell an anti assault pepper named merkele-perkele . 
  a state ca n't cherrypick where to apply the law , on this i agree ; but the kurds are the only ones actually fighting isis on the ground , and the only thing they give to non kurd fighters is ammo and sustainment . 
  the situation is at least morally controversial . 
  this kind of double application is n't strange , ie : pedophiliac intercourse is charged both in the country it took place and in italy .
