  `` home of the christianity '' is one of their go-to reason . 
  i 've just finished watching the news , and apparently isis threw another `` we 're coming to you '' to italy and an effective libyan government is still far . 
  this is only a symptom tho , i 'm sure the defense knows something more . 
  anything regarding intervention in libyan territories would require a nato mandate , so this is what 's possible to do as of today . 
  i do n't agree with 100 % of israel 's actions which they motivate with `` safety '' . 
  ` deteriorating security situation ' . 
  the ministry of defense ordered the deployment of 4 [ amx planes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amx_international_amx ) at trapani birgi base . 
  the decision `` was caused by recent situation in north africa and the worsening security '' . 
  [ formal speech ] 4 amx from 51st squadron of istrana ( northern italy ) have been transferred to the trapani birgi base . 
  this decision is in addition to the current ` mare sicuro ' operation , defending multiple national interests and to assure coherent safety levels '' the four planes are in reconnaissance asset and have been added to the operation which has a predator already deployed . 
  amx are faster then the drone . 
  sidevote , you lost me at the second part . 
  this is sad , only hope is that the current political class will damage the economy enough to cause a party with opposite views to emerge and win . 
  the labels will clearly state so , if you 're against corn syrup do n't buy it . 
   respondents were asked what languages , other than their mother tongue , they were able to speak well enough to hold a conversation .

  renzi 's party is the second healthiest after lega nord . 
  can confirm , most electronics from germany costs ~ 25 % -30 % less then here . 
  i would n't define him as a bully . 
  what he does is sending out empty statements . 
  the party he leads has 2/3 strong currents inside , a strong leadership is needed to avoid falling apart . 
  edit : we had 63 governments since we became a republic in 1948 ... a strong leadership is needed if we want the government to be functional . 
  they did n't say anything about temporary tattoos  :d, 
  i 'm missing the reference . 
   it 's not that they 're going to disappear forever , bullshit , we both know that the italian government would n't ever give them back to india even if they are found guilty . 
  the situation is not that defined , right parties want them back , left leaning ones have been complacent and not too vocal about it . 
  i present to you : [ mar\u00f2 slug .

  thanks for the insight . 
   arguments all of which have been used [ ... ] in actual cases nowhere in that pages it tells that those arguments were used in * successfull * cases . 
  and context : sorry , but that website seems like a personal blog of a mrs. 
  anyone , with no proven knowledge of the legal system . 
  this a ) lacks any kind of context and b ) does n't say if any of these claims actually changed the judge 's verdict . 
  and just by doing that he invested the money better then 99 % of lottery winners , good for him . 
  what an oddly specific award .

  bad jokes aside , those drainage holes will get clogged after the first storm , awful design . 
  afaik only norway had lax rules on fertilizers , and this was before the crazy arian guy went on a killing spree . 
  still , the article does n't give information which and how much explosive material the girl had . 
  i was just speculating . 
  she might as well hoarded firecrackers for what i know . 
  hell , even gas tank rigged with a detonator might be considered an explosive . 
  i would have imagined a few o in there . 
  and even then , the situation is sustainable if the nation is a creditor one . 
  there 's still a synthesis process to separate rdx but yeah , if you manage to secure enough fertilizer it 's not too hard to do . 
   finnish people each one in a separate individually wrapped nutshell .

  2015 - president of the republic giorgio napolitano [ resigned from office . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/giorgio-napolitano-resigns-italian-politics-bids-farewell-to-the-president-who-gave-silvio-9976068.html ), 
  that 's why i put `` unless '' in my first response . 
  a big country gets more attractive if it taxes more ? 
  and put it in that bag !, 
  thank you !, 
  unless they transform in a tax heaven they become less attractive for foreign investments . 
   vanska said some asylum seekers had been seen near schools with phones . 
  everyone is near everything with a phone . 
  they were almost going to close before the attacks , in a perverted twist of destiny the terror attacks were good for the paper . 
   company policy prohibited the use of the messaging app for personal purposes . 
  he knew he was breaking an explicit rule . 
  do you really think that israel is doing any good to peace in its area by sluggishly invading another nation ? 
  oh come on , the only strategy in place is destabilizing palestine , they are n't blocking any kind of trade or military movement , just fomenting hostility . 
  i 'm not the one saying that , it 's the [ un ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8364815.stm ) . 
  and have an infinite threat to it coming from the desert for decades ? 
  i 'm not criticizing deadly force against an attacker , but the fact of child detention and occupation . 
  and happy cake day you corno . 
  how can you justify colonization with security reasons ? 
  with your logic we should invade syria and libya permanently . 
   why we are not able to pre-screen people at the external borders m. o. n. e. y. 
  handling all those people costs a truckload of money and manpower . 
  people like to go against southern europe without considering the costs of handling all these people , it 's all about `` control them '' . 
  with what money ? 
  what about the occupation of the west bank ? 
  i 've got no trouble with them taking down terrorists , but why condemn russia expansion and not israel 's ? 
  you talk about egypt in 1948 , but what about the constant creeping expansion of israel in the west bank , even after 1967 ? 
  well , for one thing civilians in occupied territories are processed by military courts , with multiple years sentences for throwing stones . 
  well , she has worded it poorly , but israel forces are quite trigger and arrest happy . 
  being better then your neighbors do n't exactly make you good . 
  italians like foreign chicks . 
  what 's the deal with bordeaux ? 
  why is there even an x there ? 
  at least you recognize that the uk is in a privileged position . 
  greece simply does n't have the money to do that , and even in italy that is being a really tough pressure on the public balance . 
  controlling the border of an island costs a microscopic fraction compared to land borders . 
  the uk is lucky to be both an island and surrounded by friendly enough nations . 
  go and try to discuss with libya or turkey , i dare you . 
  erdo\u011fan rose into power in 2003 and since that year turkey 's gdp has grown 270 % . 
  a lot people link the two factors . 
  i see what you did there . 
  one thing i like about my country is that it 's big enough to be relevant on an international scale , but not so much to be under threat from terrorism . 
  hop on / r/italy if you want some advice from locals ( best time to post seems to be early evening ) . 
  i would argue even more that military bases in practice . 
  if it 's not an active war airports do n't have a symbolic value , so they are safer . 
  heeeey , a pool of 1 is perfectly sized . 
  do n't buy into that `` significant pool '' mumbo-jumbo .
