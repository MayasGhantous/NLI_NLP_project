  i do n't like some aspect of the us , but damn at least innovation is n't shot down with cruise missiles there . 
  italy is one of the most depressing countries on this aspect , our agriculture lobby is like your big pharma , so fucking untouchable it 's depressing . 
  it 's impossible changing their status quo . 
  the hex color value of the brown areas unaffected by artifacts is 984827 , israel 's nearest color to that value is 976254 ( near the center ) . 
  if israel 's color was truly brown it would have values near the middle the ones on the china/north korea border , and those range between 4fxxxx-71xxxx ( excluding the areas near sea , which adds a third noise source ) . 
  i 'm highly skeptical that israel 's true color is brown . 
  korea has seen an incredibly massive growth in wealth ( see [ asian tigers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/four_asian_tigers ) ) in the later 30 or so years , so a 30-40 year person person in the 80s would have been at the peak of his career and consequently wealth . 
  also , the graph shows * relative * poverty , if a country has a sizable upper class that can allow itself a luxurious life this does n't mean that poor people have troubles making ends meet . 
  a last point is that south korean culture sees generous parents that in later life are technically poor , but receive a lot of support from their now adult prole . 
  yet another point is that south korea is highly centralized with the capital seoul 's metropolitan area having half of the entire nation population , this causes a great disparity between rural and metropolitan areas .

  israel looks red to me , compression blurred green and red and it looks brown-ish . 
  still chuckled . 
  lead years in the 60s 70s , mafia bombings in the 90s ... 
  the relevance of terrorism is being waaay overhyped, 
  that 's hilarious . 
  i wish ... 
  fair point . 
  i would argue that a romania in shengen will create potential for competition which will in turn allow for more convenient deals for shipping companies . 
  one of the reason of some countries blocking romania 's entry is the desire of member states to keep their share and profits in the commercial navy sector . 
  well , because ... they can . 
  romania is closer to asia and , while it 's farther from western europe , its roads can hold a larger volume of traffic then the mountainous balkans . 
  force was used either way , there are no innocent parties . 
  we just happen to be in the west , so what france does is `` good '' , which is true if we put our interests above others ' .

  well , * troia * is * cunt * when used to mean * whore * . 
  * figa * is * pussy * , and it 's used like cona in portuguese . 
  in my original post i just gave an example and did n't want to be prolix . 
  * guerre di troia * , i can guarantee you that 90 % of middle school students has joked about * figli di troia * and teachers let it pass . 
  you ca n't blame jews , they * are * of limited intellect \u00af \\ \\ ( \u30c4 ) / \u00af, 
  afaik national governments can still put harsher restriction , at least on food and other health related products .

  while his proposition are crazy basic income for * citizens * is the way to go . 
  from migrant to citizens the road is all but easy . 
  with increasing automation employment opportunities will shrink , it 's already happening in china . 
  and look at the opposite : norwegian state still keeps technology implementation low exactly to use more people . 
   2 % of income for the poorest-paid to 79 % for the highest . 
  da , tovarish . 
  the guys that sold a lot petrol to italy . 
  they still do in a limited fashion due to infrastructure falling apart due to both destruction and impossibility to send maintenance crews in most areas . 
  france wanted a slice of that . 
  if you want to nitpick on grammar first learn the language . 
  i * did n't * formulate the sentence to include * every * minority . 
  prison population is always heavily skewed towards minorities . 
  this happens everywhere . 
  do you think an illegal immigrant can land a job at a consulting firm ? 
  where did you see the privilege in risking your life in the desert and working illegally if at all ? 
  if you can send only one person you 'll send the one that 's more likely to succeed , and surprise surprise a young man is more likely to .

  eeehm , mr 4,6 % do you want our 11,5 ? 
  there 's always work in agriculture if you do n't mind that the daily job gets to the lowest bidder . 
  do n't fear , it 's an opinion , not a normal article . 
  they live in a misogynist culture , most females and children stay in their home country and let `` the man '' make the perilous travel . 
  this and men have better low qualified employment opportunities virtually everywhere in the world . 
  he would then either send money back or organize a safer route for his family . 
  ok , here we go : ** case a ** ** tl ; dr ** i ca n't summarize it , blaspheme expletive in italian are an unique case . 
  read the long part . 
  * scenario * : live tv show with live moderated sms stream on new year 's eve * event * : the technician who oversaw the sms stream let a message with a blaspheme slur slip through . 
  he has been reprimanded and might get fired . 
  * evidence * : https://i.imgur.com/wtmjpna.png * explanation * : * porco dio * is literally * pork god * . 
  italian has 3 tiers of swear words : - tier 0 , light : * cavolo * ( literally * cabbage * , do n't ask me why lol ) , * diavolo * ( * devil * , equivalent to english * hell * ) , * porco * ( * pig * ) , ... - ^ \\ ( a ) the following 3 only : * madonna * ( mary mother of jesus ) , * ges\u00f9 * / * cristo * / * ges\u00f9 cristo * ( * jesus * / * christ * / * jesus christ * ) , * dio * ( * god * ) . 
  - tier 1 , strong : * cazzo ( * fuck * ) , merda ( * shit * ) , troia ( * cunt * ) , ... * - tier 2 , extreme : any tier 0 ^ \\ ( a ) + tier 1 tier 2 if literally taken they are blaspheme expletive , but today they have a meaning of extreme swear words . 
  ** case b ** usually here in italy we have 2/3 fire and forget movies . 
  they sell a lot for a few weeks/month then they get forgotten into oblivion . 
  the formula that 's most successful for locally produced movie is : a realistic story with romantic substory where the viewers can not only empathize also see themselves being one of the protagonists . 
  this works because a lot of italians are pretty homogeneous . 
  * happened to hit the nail on the head and has resonated with a lot of people . 
  and no , i have n't seen the movie but have read reviews of it to understand why it got so big . 
  good enough :p ? 
  i agree , do n't know why i posted my previous comment . 
  electronic payment is already that , and if you have a phone ( even a brick one , phone towers still log you ) they know where you are with a few hundred meters error already . 
  we get a lot of central african immigration , living in a shelter in italy while working illegally , so 0 benefits , is worse that living in their home country . 
  exactly , our government hinted in a not too veiled fashion that there would be a much stricter identification process if europe gives at least more financial leeway . 
  politics is compromise , but go tell that to bruxelles . 
  yes , 1940 italy had mediocre armed forces bar a few division in the army . 
  not nuclear blast proof , but modern tanks were and still are built nbc ( ** n ** uclear ** b ** acteriological ** c ** hemical ) proof . 
  \\ - well , a distracted tv techincian aired a * porco dio * on new year 's eve . 
  * , an italian movie got double the revenue of the force awakens in 9 days . 
  it 's a story about an middle tier public administrative and his conflict between safe employment and his female humanitarian worker lover . 
  he gets a generous layoff , goes to work with the lover and everyone lives happy ever after .

  my guess is that the explosives were there , but the detonators were n't . 
  what about gdp ppp ? 
  it depends on where you hit , striking the head is much more likely to cause death . 
  we 're the richest of the lower tier wooo .

  who wants into nordic ?

  the definition is broader then just cookies . 
  [ article 5 \\ ( 3 \\ ) ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=celex:32002l0058:en:html ) of the eprivacy directive states the following :  [ ... ] the use of electronic communications networks to store information or to gain access to information stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user [ ... ] any kind of usage statistic or diagnostic logging , pretty much essential if you want to properly maintain a website , needs explicit consent . 
  as of [ 2015 ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2054rank.html ) germany had a lower birthrate . 
  if you look at the animation it seems that around 2025 germany will have some kind of increase in the birthrate .
