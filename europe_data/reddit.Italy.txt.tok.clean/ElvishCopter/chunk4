  use nato to defend an invaded member country , are you mad ? 
  noobs . 
  it 's more like a parking lot for russian tank crews , 
  shut up , fake lampedusa ^ ^ ** / s **, 
  he was nominated by the president , which in turn was elected by the parliament . 
  ironically putin is way more democratic then renzi . 
  [ russia 's main exports ] ( http://www.worldstopexports.com/russias-top-10-exports/2350 ) are raw materials and a risible amount of cereals and machinery ( 3,2 % togheter ) . 
  the average consumer ca n't really do anything with this . 
  economic sanctions are the best tool we have seeing as most of eu will be in deep trouble by banning ru oil export . 
  gas , russia is one of the major exporters . 
  they have italy by the nuts with this . 
  in the last years there have been sightings of the venomous [ portuguese man o ' war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/portuguese_man_o'_war ) , a `` siphonophora '' ( meduse looking organism ) , but still no reported deaths . 
  maybe it 's because denmark has a generally colder climate then uk , which is a stress on the human body . 
  edit : probably bs , i have n't checked . 
  something tells me you 'll have fun on r/conspiracy, 
  pass the piss bro . 
  the problem with wikipedia it 's not the storage , but the massive traffic it has to sustain . 
  and by the way a lot of russian people already use proxies/vpns, 
  genghis khan is 1 , wich in and of itself is statistically insignificant . 
  even more if compared to the number of well-off people in even the smallest of country . 
  lazy pun explanation time : * kurwa * has the same sound as * curva * ( curve ) . 
   exceptionally brutal towards their inhabitants ( we hold the distinction for the first use of airplane bombing against civilian targets ) you 've forgot to mention that we used chemical warfare in those invasions . 
  too bad there is n't a skrap shop nearby . 
  it 's just an oversized carrot holder, 
  come here , people will just think you 're obsessed about turning . 
  roastbeef is sublime . 
  i 'd add racism into that list, 
  the couple on the left is clearly fighting , why does nobody interevene ? 
  funny how evolution does that . 
  i suggest you to look at - [ http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/**have**] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/have ) - [ http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/**can**] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/can ) and play `` spot the difference '' between the two . 
  * regular * immigrants . 
  and of course i am in the worst performing northern region :|, 
  that 's capitalism 101 . 
  but it 's the best we have . 
  the number rose to 4400 . 
  is that also valid for e-books ? 
  about german-japanese stuff : search * hitomi tanaka + milena velba * , you might enjoy it . 
  it surely did ... interessante mini-dibattito . 
  i switched the name of diaz with the 12th division one , major error on my part . 
  i share your views on your 1st and 2nd point . 
  on your 3rd point i could rebate that 700k man strong used in the hundred day offensive is a little more then diplomatic pressure . 
   coming back from the brink of ruin is no small feat mainly because they were under massive pressure from the western front , and the looming desire of secession from the south slavs and czechoslovakia . 
  and the commander that achieved the major success was a french . 
  it was indeed a victory , but no great feat as it 's taught in schools . 
  edit : confused army general with a division one , ups . 
  the 1917 battle of caporetto against austria-hungary is worth mentioning . 
  -- it 's also known as the twelfth battle of the isonzo . 
  the 11 battles before resulted in a stalemate . 
  this last battle saw 350k austro-hungarians against 400k italians achieve an overwhelming victory . 
  we suffered : - loss of 50 % of our artillery pieces and misc heavy weaponry at the time - 10k kias - 50k desertions - 265k became pows - 300k broke ranks all this in a span of 3 weeks , with just 20 % losses on the attacker side . 
  did i mention that the attackers were severely underfed due to the allied blockade ? 
  this lead to the sacking of the chief italian army commander at the time and a revolution in italy 's army organization and training to achieve ... a draw at the end of the war . 
  the gains for the austro-hungarians were marginal and shortly after fell into an attrition warfare for the rest of the war , but this complete defeat is still considered the major failure in our recent history , at least militarily . 
  censored bukkascat ? ... 
  nope thanks . 
  such thing must not exist . 
  china ? 
  * throws potato *, 
  that was n't garlic powder , and he knew . 
  point taken, 
  oh sweet summer child , come down here and we 'll show you what rotten really is . 
  googling around i 've seen that some yiddish people use that , and it also looks pretty cool . 
  it way the only way polandball-ize it , i would have had to draw 15 + flags in a ball . 
  besides , swiss german is in the same dialect group ( alemannic german ) as south tyrolean , there are really marginal differences . 
  i tried , but it looked too chaotic . 
  just edited with correct colors , 
  ~ ~ fuck ~ ~ , damage repaired . 
  in their own country , or in foreign nations by legal means , not by illegally going to a place and hoping on a refugee status . 
  as a place to immigrate when you 're poor , yes . 
  you 're welcome if there is war or an harsh dictatorship . 
  if you 're just poor and have no special abilities sorry , but we have those already . 
  imo it 's because there 's simply a lot of romanians here so they do n't feel alone . 
  plus pro football players are payed pretty well . 
  eh , from in their home countries there is a lot of `` europe paradise '' propaganda . 
  there needs to be a counter propaganda movements in those countries where a lot of those immigrants come . 
  i get it now !, 
  russia needs 3 dead brothers to survive . 
  that 's why crimea , and partially ukraine , have fallen . 
  who will be the last sacrificial lamb ... looking at you estonia . 
   castilian and spanish are the same language . 
  til , i thought it was only a dialect and not also the `` official '' spanish language . 
  we just bake in the glory of the sun , there 's no need for puny wind .

  if it 's true that some 3000 people were put in a community , no matter the size , to live there indefinitely the state has failed in dealing with the situation . 
  while there are some points expressed out of anger that i do n't really agree with it 's impossible to negate that having so many people come there on a 0 day notice will cause problems . 
  those people are coming if the citizens want it or not , at least on mid-term span . 
  what could be done is moving little groups of people in different part of the country . 
  [ there you go . 
  [ good boss mod team . 
  bravo/a !, 
  fyi : if the menu is in english it 's a tourist trap 70 % of the time . 
  and if the outcome is positive they might even become * good * mods :o, 
  * we have the technology * but for one reason or another it 's easier to just stay there and look . 
  then let 's make it even : 1 bull for 1 runner . 
  good , this primitive tradition needs to end . 
  eh , prices go up until there 's sufficient demand .
