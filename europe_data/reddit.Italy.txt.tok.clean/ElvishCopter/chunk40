  there are already 81 millions german citizens . 
  migration is probably even less then the error tolerance of that projection .

  hey , at least we put the n word in windows . 
  instead you only created windows , pffft . 
  because it 's private propriety . 
  even just from an utilitarian point of view it would make smuggling and contraband surge , and you do n't want more reason for tension in the migrant community . 
  do n't be mad , they forgot to put * an * at the end of the url and the css looks kinda similar . 
  they are simple minded , remember . 
   proposed search powers allows police to confiscate asylum seekers ' belongings worth more than $ 436 to help pay for their stay . 
  this * is * worrying . 
  keep them on , generally . 
  we 're not big on carpets . 
  but a lot of people take them off if they 're with family/friends . 
   jawor wtf some sort of benevolent saint knight that gives parts of his possession to mendicants ?

  one thing is to publish hateful comments , another is incitement to violent action and/or discrimination . 
  the legislative system . 
  did you take social studies ? 
  every law it 's open for abuse then , but without law it would be anarchy . 
  a community needs rules to be functional , and one 's right stop when an another are damaged . 
  the first phrase is just offensive , the second * could * be incitement to violence . 
  but without an additional scenario the whole sentence is only offensive . 
  we 're talking about regulating hate speech , not offensive . 
  if matters escalate at a level requiring an official definition it will be the role of the judiciary system . 
  hate speech is incitement to violence and discrimination due to race , ethnicity , religion , sexual orientation or gender identity , anything else is n't hate speech . 
  the only time when the legitimacy of hate speech is called into discussion is , at least in the country i live in , to justify orthodox and discriminatory ideas . 
  afaik the sexual and gender parts are lacking from bulgaria , germany , italy , latvia and czech republic , and this should change . 
  there 's a difference between offensive and hate speech . 
  could it be * rovira * ? 
  it 's a small german brand . 
  * in germany italy had a really peaceful new year 's eve , no deaths due to firecracker mishandling and 66 % less firefighter intervention compared to 2014 . 
  i like how they are actually aiming for a car free paris . 
  refugee should , asylum seekers would need to be examined to assess refugee status . 
  this has left italy without a say on eu migration in the cabinet , despite being at the center of the refugee crisis . 
  italy received more than 150,000 arrivals by sea in 2015 , second in the eu behind greece . 
  this could actually be a good idea . 
  in italy ? 
  slowly decreasing since the late 80s and took a dip in 2009 , when the crisis hit the real market in italy . 
  it 's getting better really slowly , but with an ever increasing inequality . 
  you 're late :p, 
  i 've got bad news for you then , we have 5 already , since [ mid september 2015 ] ( http://www.firstonline.info/a/2015/09/16/rifugiati-commissione-ue-5-hotspot-gia-operativi-i/1d8293fd-c6b8-4874-b6c5-ef1388e1847e ) , with [ plans for at least 6 ] ( http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2015-09-16/migranti-ecco-l-identikit-hot-spot-italiani--162906.shtml?uuid=acu5g0y&amp;refresh_ce=1 ) .

  you gave me flashbacks to avisynth tinkering , it was fun . 
  the topic is charlie hebdo , and i suggest you to look up [ cynicism ] ( https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/cynisme ) . 
  better climate , lower cost of life . 
  a lot of northern europeans retirees buy propriety on any location near the mediterranean , not only in france . 
  the paper saw some 10 editions without luz and yet sales are stable . 
  sales have tripled their pre-terror levels , at most it will end like a band that got too famous , internal conflicts . 
  from a cynic point of view the paris terror attacks were a good thing for charlie ebdo , it went from a niche paper with moderate sales to being known worldwide . 
  i wish i could find a cappuccino for 1,33 $ , lower i 've had it 's 1,50 $ . 
  italy seems to have more convenient transport fares ( the quality is far from being on par with norway ) and beers . 
  from that it would be convenient for him to come to italy if his major expense is in local beers , lol . 
  [ exhibit a ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3zl3by/the_city_of_milan_will_pay_you_350_euros_per/cyn0iv3 ), 
  so we have to move emergency services , police , rebuild decrepit infrastructures ... 
  it would cost a ton of resources . 
  the alternative is housing them in empty barracks and other abandoned/dismissed buildings in the city area where services and infrastructure are already present , thus achieving a better integration on top of a massive saving in costs . 
  this incentive given out by the city will really help with integration . 
  while far from being omnicomprehensive it will achieve a far higher level of integration , if only by having locals and foreigners eat at the same table . 
  fiscal pressure is around 50 % in italy . 
  love the flair .

  it has worked so well for france ... 
   if the outer borders registered immigrants as the dublin agreement orders , there would n't be a problem . 
  so to keep them all here ? 
  ok , but let 's make it easier to ship them back by giving those countries either more funds or allow them for a larger deficit margin . 
  another sensible thing would be to seal pacts with african countries to take those people . 
  showing the name of the locations would have been nice ... 
   silence is consent ( * il silenzio \u00e8 assenso * ) .

  ** lazy workers ** . 
  probably italians have a reputation of lazy workers , but in reality the producticity is on par with the oecd average .

  luckily it 's isolated into southern apulia , we 're still the 2nd world producer of olive oil . 
  and 66 % of italian production is higher value extra virgin . 
  the agricultural sector has become healthy again , our main problem is the stagnant second sector . 
  total security is simply impossible . 
  what 's sensible is increasing funding and cooperation between intelligence forces .

  yeah , i overemphasized .
