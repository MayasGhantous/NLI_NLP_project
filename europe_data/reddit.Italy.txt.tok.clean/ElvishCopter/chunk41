  but i have a question : did they have a loan , take care of elders/young people , etc ? 
  these can significantly lower your isee while still having a good income . 
  what 's the margin of error or the confidence of those polls ? 
  without those data you could say that 195 % of britons are great sharpshooters . 
  interesting read , worth the 12 minutes it takes . 
  only one pet peeve : i hate how refugee has become a synonym of illegal immigrant . 
  do they get a package including automatic refugee status with their smuggle ? 
  why are they even waiting in processing camps ? 
  and 80 $ was the max amount that one could receive , to get those you had to classify as either low income or had to have high expenses ( loan , taking care of old/young people ... ), 
  `` luckily '' italy imports 2x what we export to china , so we 're not hit as hard as canada or australia . 
  the russian crisis is more important to us .

  i do n't work with passports , but when you 're `` transitioning '' you still have by all means the starting point gender . 
  the reform is not bad per se , but the new powers that the state gives itself is too much . 
  do n't be sad , you beat us on [ tourism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_tourism_rankings#most-visited_countries_by_international_tourist_arrivals_in_2014 ) . 
  but the waste/energy from nuclear power is much lower than a lot of other sources . 
  and yet there 's a facebook group called `` female tourists photographing michelangelo 's david penis '' . 
  got to love facebook 's consistency . 
  it `` snowed '' in a lot of northern cities . 
  `` snow '' because most of the time it was the kind not cold enough to settle . 
  if they ask you anything but to id yourself it 's sensible to not say anything before seeking legal advice if not a lawyer . 
  generally speaking italian police is more relaxed then the us . 
  the exception is riot police or prison guards , do n't fuck with them . 
  there is also a lot of propaganda going in those top countries . 
  even the us , just think about how much tv and movies rarely put a bad shade on the nation . 
  fear the might of [ captain per\u00f9 ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/bc/9f/48/bc9f487c90a0b7b2eefc589ba78561cc.jpg ) . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ believe ^ ^ you, 
  gender helps in the identification in all but a minuscule amount of cases , this is frankly ridiculous . 
  as others pointed out australia added a third option for the gender field , not removed it . 
  are we really so mistrusting compared to how foreigners see us ? 
  france still has less then italy and spain :p,

  it rained !, 
  finally , some areas saw water falling after 60 + days without a single drop . 
  they are close enough culturally and especially economically , so it 's worth having turkey pov in european stuff . 
  you could do some volunteer work for the european voluntary service , look into it . 
  could you post a source please ?

  renzi , italy : he 's a pretty great speaker in italian , especially in giving speeches that ca n't be twisted to have another meaning . 
  something that berlusconi was n't able to , albeit he counterbalanced it with his charisma . 
  english is another matter tho .

  [ # 3 higher resolution ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ndqdf6o.jpg ), 
  if a nation is rich enough to attract so many low wage migrants it means that most of the native population is quite rich . 
  harsher competition for low wage jobs does n't mean lowering living standards , a form of minimum wage is what is needed . 
  about islands : then * if * it 's economically sensible doing so that 's a valid option , i have to retract the latter part of my statement . 
  poor people emigrate into richer nations , education does n't really matter , a fruit picker in italy earns more then a factory work in most african countries . 
  do n't look at the us , japan or korea , they have a geography that helps them be isolated . 
  wait 15-20 years and ee wo n't be so `` pure '' anymore . 
  and playing the australia card does n't really work , we do n't have stable nations that can agree to ship migrants , or isolated island to spare in europe . 
  a long term plan would be stabilizing at least the countries next to europe , so the influx can be moderated . 
  i hope i 'm not coming out wrong , but eastern europe was historically less wealthy then western europe , globalization brings wealth but also risks . 
  heh , far right parties are having a field day at it , couple that with the sensationalism that the internet gives to stuff like this . 
  mind you that this sub is quite right-leaning . 
  what you see here on reddit if far more emphasized then real life, 
  italy had no part on his violent removal , it was mainly a british-french idea . 
  the seller pays 0,5-0 ,7 % for a debit card transaction , 1-4 % for credit . 
  buyer usually does n't pay commission if it 's in italy . 
  nah , more likely retail workers will simply get payed less .

  they could probably defend well against north korea alone , but not if nk is reinforced by china raw size . 
  if you register a refugee it 's your duty to handle them . 
  which is bullshit since it puts pressure only to border countries , that will in turn look the other way when those refugees will try to sneak to the richer central nations . 
  south korea is 6th worldwide by gdp % and japan 15th . 
  there are 186 ( s. korea ) and 175 ( japan ) that spend less %, 
  if you 're a european country you have 2 threats : russia and the chaotic middle east .
