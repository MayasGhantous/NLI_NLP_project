  on the bureaucracy aspect : add spending caps to the bureaucracy . 
  long story short : you do n't want an eu country to go over 3 % budget deficit . 
  yes it may make sense when there is an healthy economy , but this system is crap under stress . 
  that 's the key : you can prescreen them , we ca n't . 
  we ca n't simply turn around the boats : african countries are either either in complete chaos or too poor to really seal their borders . 
  and turkey also closes one eye and looks another way with the other . 
  in italy 's case , even if 2015 saw an opposite trend ( -8 % immigrates compared to 2014 ) thanks to greece collapsing , we 're still flooded with them and the average processing time is over one year . 
  you also have oceans separating you from the other continents , and immigration from mexico is manageable . 
  we have few dozen nautical miles top , few hundred meters if you look at the greece/turkey border . 
  yay , we 've got a decent human being that is n't good only good at kicking a round object . 
  stock owners probably hope for it ^ ^ sorry, 
  maybe it 's me , but youtube hd videos are washed out , meanwhile vimeo ones are more crisp and without noticeable noise . 
  dailymotion is great for fansub stuff and non porn nsfw . 
  allegedly , the only source for now is the sun . 
  which is n't really famed for it 's sobriety . 
  but i guess that the hammer of the public court , more important then the legal one for a politician , has already fallen . 
  mind you , if this has really happened he should pay .

  does this [ vimeo link ] ( https://vimeo.com/35536511 ) work ? 
   although the girl [ ... ] was over the age of consent , [ ... ] allegations were particularly embarrassing for an mp who had devoted much of his time in recent years to campaigning about child protection . 
  i find it interesting how much the public and private spheres are intertwined in the anglo-saxon world . 
  even if the allegations are proved true , what 's the matter ? 
  they would have been two people both in the age of consent exchanging private communications ... 
  about the american elections , there are people that think that trump wo n't be nominated . 
  they think that the next candidate in line will absorb the minor candidates votes and end up with beating trump . 
  do you still see horse resting stations at your favorite gasthaus ? 
  they retired an obsolete technology . 
  you could have a titanium fitting for all that matters . 
  the problem is how much pressure the glass can handle . 
  i 'm not an accountant , but by what i know getting a discount on your taxes ( lol ) only happens for massive tax evasion cases . 
  it 's not uncommon for companies to sink due to taxes . 
  hah , and that 's not changing anytime soon . 
  there 's been 0 discussion about long term plans against pollution . 
  we 'll have to wait until 2019 to see a ban on the circulation of euro 0 ( higher pollution category ) cars . 
  for reference : euro 1 was mandatory for new vehicles sold after 1992 . 
  a lot of european products would n't be competitive without all these customs fees . 
  low and middle tier autos , most of the agricultural sector ... we 're shooting ourselves in the foot to avoid chopping the entire leg off . 
  yeah , no . 
  i went to dachau a couple of years ago . 
  people were respectful , and to be honest the experience was pretty mild . 
  one month in kurdistan with provisions for 1 week . 
  that 's the point that i poorly tried to make . 
  i tried an hyperbole but failed . 
  there 's a considerable amount of filo serbian redditors in this sub , and they want that economically useless , no offense to kosovars , piece of land back . 
  that said i really liked that album , i 'm in love with mountainous landscapes . 
  you should n't go to naples on new year 's eve then .

  the big bright spot on the center right is naples . 
  the outskirts of the city encompass the active [ volcano vesuvius ] ( http://www.vitalowcost.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/vesuvio-di-notte1.jpg ) , which has erupted every 20 to 70 years . 
  the last eruption was in 1944 . 
  it 's highly likely that we 'll see a disastrous eruption in the not so distant future . 
  mh , spitroast + hands full . 
  the math works . 
   yeter no , the most similar sounding that comes to mind is `` ester '' which has a totally different meaning and origin . 
  there has n't been much if any turkish influence in our peninsula . 
  2015 was a good year for italy , the economy is starting to grow again and migrant influx is -8 % then 2014 . 
  it 's nice to not be one of the worst countries anymore , thank you finland :p, 
  naming people after things is n't that uncommon . 
  we have asia , viola ( the flower ) , chiara ( clear ) . 
  we also have some torrent websites `` blocked '' . 
  well , we do use jesus . 
  italy has 6,7 \u2030 and the us 41,2 \u2030 .

  we 're similar to poland on that , but if the nearest crossing is too far ( 100 meters i believe ) you 're allowed to cross . 
  fans in korea can be really dangerous tho . 
  we 're not so different after all . 
  the purposed law is similar to germany 's actual system . 
  i 'll try to give an overview of what might happen : ** tl ; dr : ** it 's moderately likely to pass on the lower house , uncertainty for upper house .

   he/she might have been ... overly enthusiastic i 'm not disagreeing with you . 
  media = sheer amount of american media related products ( movie , games , books ... ) in circulation in any country 's market . 
  it 's improbable that american culture is extrareous for anyone . 
  compare that to say , german or french productions , which are dwarfed by us ones both in raw numbers and permeation in all but few ex colonies . 
  they are high school teacher , mind you . 
  if you passed your first year in any law related university you have more then enough preparation . 
  but it 's a public job , so if you do n't have a degree you 'll be put on the bottom of an already long list . 
  he/she might have been ... overly enthusiastic about americanization but in a way it 's right . 
  us media tend to be attractive and mold most cultures . 
  i still think that integrating foreign kids is easier if they are put into normal classes from day 0 , they 'll get to communicate with their classmates and not only learn the language but will be exposed to a new culture in a protected environment like a school is . 
  next day : * serbian guards forget to close cell doors , 80 inmates escape . 
  * jokes apart , good for serbia . 
  ditto here , having the instruments to teach most scientific subjects also open doors for a ) employment and career growth in the field b ) roughly 200 % pay compared to teaching . 
  we have tons in right and economy , want some ?
