  i 'm skeptic on special classes as a concept itself , unless the subject is already completely irrecoverable . 
  they do nothing but isolate those people even more . 
  fuck that fuck you ? 
  re-nounce pound ster-ling !,

  look like [ rj-45 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/pkuczynski_rj-45_patchcord.jpg ) connectors to me . 
  i like the combination of classic vexillogy and modern technology . 
  here 's what i found about him thanks to google 's reverse image search . 
  this is a photo taken in august 2008 of caporal antonio metruccio , 27 . 
  he was in * 66 \u00b0 reggimento aeromobile trieste * ( air deployed infantry ) , not special forces . 
  he 's an article that gives an idea of the condition of his deployement : http://www.faustobiloslavo.eu/news/85.pdf, 
   some 978 people more or less a few limbs ? 
  and i fasted this past christmas . 
  regular cig butts are already biodegradable ( 15 to 20 years according to google ) . 
  my guess is people on / new that want only what interests them to rise . 
  sometimes i do it too , since downvoting is also supposed to mean `` i 'm not interested by this '' . 
  dog poop has never been a big problem , at least where i lived . 
  it varies massively , in my city there 's at least one every ~ 100 meters , but finding one in some towns or even some specific districs in bigger cities can be challenging . 
  i think they 'll make some bank in tourist areas tho . 
  apple is slowly starting to use usb-c , and in a few years it will be widespread in many other low-tier products . 
  the technology is there , we just need to wait some time for it to become affordable . 
  we 're trying the opposite of him now : at first we had a politician turn comic , now we 're rooting for a comic turned politician . 
  tl ; dr : refugees are treated like any other non historic minority ; few people accept them and a lot of the people that do exploit their lack of housing option . 
  well , the gdp finally started increasing again . 
  pls germany , give us your political stability . 
  that 's what happens when the forget the parliament door open . 
  agree on the bullshit part , but gold also has unique thermal and electrical capabilities . 
  diamonds are a better comparison , there are huge reserves but extractions are limited to inflate the value . 
  smaller market , higher costs . 
   most polluted city in italy naples is worst , but turin is a close second . 
  milan made headlines but if you take complessive pollution in account it 's the third/fourth with levels close to rome 's . 
  `` fun '' fact that happened in my city 6-7 years ago : pollution detecting stations were transferred away from the main intersections and near parks , magically pollution dropped :o, 
  can confirm , went to turin . 
  it stank . 
  yes , compared to a lot of cities it 's still clean , but it still stank . 
  that 's not how the market works , tangible good sold in bitcoin in crimea is going to be more expensive . 
  like all performance enhancing drugs cocaine would probably work for a limited amount of time . 
  after the organism gets used to it you would only normalize it . 
  i enjoy both of them , but bran 's part are becoming more introspective , so that 's difficult ad hell to port it to a visual media . 
  i actually prefer the tv version of the lannisters , especially in the last season . 
  dany 's parts are being transposed pretty awesomely too , and liam cunningham plays an awesome davos . 
  about the others ... 
  i feel neutral . 
  * minor spoiler follows * eh , bran is in the north too . 
  and he 's becoming more `` magic '' . 
  but i will be bummed if he filled in jon shoes , i do n't really like his tv series version . 
  fair point . 
  rr martin is consistent and attached to his work , i doubt he will resuscitate a character because the fans liked it . 
  the female 's vocalist and fiddle parts remembered me of eluveitie , but the last minute was meh . 
  oh , i liked the male dance choreo . 
  one good thing about metro it 's the savings on the heating bills . 
  shit . 
  we do n't have any really relevant environmentalist party so that 's not going to change in the short term . 
  now it 's the time of populist parties , so we 're not going to see any pro environment agenda pushed for some 15 years i guess . 
  we have the biggest gap in happiness between genders in the whole europe . 
  ^ whoop ^ whoop ^ ^ ^ :( ( figure 3.3 ), 
  [ vittorio sgarbi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vittorio_sgarbi ) , hands down . 
  it 's an hyperactive art critic turned politician , he has outbursts in everyone of his public apparitions . 
  he has been a candidate for pretty much everyone who wanted him for the past 25 years , ranging from greens to center parties . 
  he 's got 8 separate convictions for slander . 
  oh , he defined himself atheist one day and catholic the other . 
  sample quote :  `` if modern churches are ugly it 's because of their atheist architects '' lega nord 's salvini is also ... renowned because he always wears a customized hoodie with the name of the city he is campaigning in . 
  then the croatian said to the czech ... 
  i 'd go there for the name alone . 
  and it 's always pg , at least in brazil they spice things up . 
   italian tv , which is pretty ludicrous agree , quality productions that are not the lowest common denominator can be counted on a double amputee hand . 
  corrected . 
  tl : dr , decent free tv if you can skim all the political agenda . 
  good quality premium tv and services . 
  advertising is moderated especially on time slots when children watch , so we 're not drowning in ads . 
  ** state television rai : ** - * rai 1 * : has the pope deep in its colon , main government propaganda tool , lots of italian watch-and-forget mini series . 
  - * rai 2 * : less pope , more propaganda , runs lot of american tv shows with  40 target audience - * rai 3 * : left leaning and more cultural programming , has 2 regional news programs for each region - * rai news24 * : good and quite impartial 24/7 new channel - * other rai * : 2 sports channels and thematic channels with most programs aired in italian + original , 1 high quality cultural channel most rai channels are also on free 720p streaming with an italian geolock , you can also rewatch most of the aired content for up to 1 week . 
  -- ** private , mediaset , owned by berlusconi : ** - * rete 4 * : political right circlejerk , airs a lot of soaps and some cool old movies - * canale 5 * : rete 4 lite , airs a lot of `` investigative '' journalism that has been proven manufactured with an agenda multiple times - * italia 1 * : youngest target audience , 10-20 target audience , has hilarious crap quality news programs - * tgcom * : a 5 years old version of rainews 24 awful web portal ** private , la 7 : ** ( rete4 + canale 5 ) - political agenda -- ** satellite : ** - * sky * , hundreds of channels ranging from kids shows in arab to cultural shows and everything in between . 
  good selection of sport and movie packets . 
  has some above average quality in-house produced programs . 
  good quality 24/7 news channel with people that know what they talk about . 
  good quality hbo like features if you pay a premium . 
  - * mediaset premium * : berlusconi 's try at satellite tv , mainly survives because of exclusive deals for sport broadcasting , meh web services . 
  infiniti is their web platform . 
  ** others : ** myriad of local channels with more advertising then actual programs . 
  sprinkle food shows on most general channels and 4-5 food channels on satellite . 
  that was essentially extremely poor public relationship on the scientists ' part . 
  when disasters happen everyone wants heads to be cut off , so they were perfect scapegoats . 
  even then , they have been proved innocent . 
  this new case is caused by the pressure from environmentalists and business owners , the judiciary system did n't act proactively . 
  but let 's reinforce the stereotype of `` haha italy is so backwards lolol '' by putting together events that happened 5 years apart . 
  i knew this one as manager , employee , woman . 
  wow , forced labor by default . 
  they are both muslim , but iran is sciite and saudis are wahhabites . 
  ew , not that story again ... 
  tunisia is the most progressive and westernized arab nation . 
  well , when [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3xz6hu/brazil_declares_emergency_after_2400_babies_are/cy9bgf8 ) is the norm it 's hard to like her . 
  yep , add to that that most types of schools have 3 hours/week of english ( where 1 official hour is 50 or 55 minutes ) . 
  related to that : i went to a technical school focused on it and the last year hours for it related subjects diminished in favor of electronics ( not even digital , just basic analogical stuff ) . 
  our school system teaches all and nothing . 
  we also have technical and professional ( = simpler technical ) high schools ; in those the only foreign language taught is english . 
  school alone , at least the public ones , do n't really manage to teach foreign languages even at a conversational level ; any proper language knowledge is self-taught . 
  well , the original fiat 500 was the epitome of capitalism in 60s italy . 
  most kosovars lived the secession , which was supported by the west and opposed by russia & friends . 
  yeah , kosovo exists thanks to nato .
