  the only one we strongly like is ~ ~ obobo ~ ~ obama . 
  https://twitter.com/slaveksobotka as of now still has the tweet , hehe . 
  i 'd like his style , if it was n't for that atrocious beanie . 
  now , * that 's * 0 back strenght . 
  / u/wiquzor . equipitem ceac4 there you go , you 're safe . 
  the media , but for what i have seen in construction works and the likes they are respected . 
  ditto for italy , romanians and poles are well respected in construction work/moving or anything physical . 
  this is somewhat true here too . 
  sorry for before . 
  it 's a middle eastern stile bidet . 
  hm , it hurts but i have to admit i was wrong . 
  i gave my opinion on the whole article , title included since a good part of reddit does n't follow links but still votes . 
  ~ ~ it 's a comment to push an agenda , not a disinterested analysis . 
  add to that the omission of * former * in bloomberg 's article title . 
  seems to me that bloomberg shares soini 's views , one more reason to reduce the importance of the article . ~ ~ nothing to see here , carry on . 
  i meant `` less '' , not `` more '' . 
  shadow edited . 
  why the foreign minister and not the finance/economics one ? 
   the comments come as a former foreign minister gathers signatures in an effort to force the government to hold a referendum on euro membership . 
  his statements are not impartial , i give it even less importance . 
  i doubt that even by forcing certain products into the european market regulatory standards on medicine prescription will be affected . 
  `` colony settlement '' is by itself already terrifying ... 
  i think finland would really like a trip to greece . 
  also , older people here also call it * baby jesus *, 
  i found it unnerving too . 
  well , at least you show your intentions through your username . 
  neither do the courts that condemned him . 
  wwi also forced people that only knew their village dialect to hear italian from their officers , bursting their bubble of isolation . 
  more like putting the genus of the fish before its name . 
  it 's technically correct , but nobody does that . 
  the size of organized crime in italy is the same as the automobiles and car parts sector exports in germany . 
  edit : forgot how to english, 
  and if you want any kind of job in certain areas you have to be under one of their members . 
  that 's right , but you 'll never hear mafia ` ndrangheta/cosa nostra/camorra/sacra corona unita in an italian sentence . 
  sorry , but reading * ` ndrangheta mafia * makes me laugh . 
  i understand the meaning of * mafia * out of italy but it would be like saying you 're eating a * cod tuna *, 
  i agree with you , what they did is disgustingly unsanitary . 
  this is having 0 success , take it down . 
  the correlation was n't mentioned nor implied in / u/econ _ orc message , only the real amount of deaths compared to the threat . 
  - 2014 terror attack victims in the us : [ 2 events , 5 deaths ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_terrorist_incidents,_2014 ) ( search by `` united states '' to see the nr of events ) - 2014 mass shooting victims in the us : [ 181 events , 373 deaths ] ( http://www.shootingtracker.com/wiki/mass_shootings_in_2014 ) mass shootings have an higher victim count that terror attacks , but by what i can see the general public in the us fears terrorism more then mass shootings . 
  edit : corrected first link, 
  [ seagal was at the moscow victory day parade . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/ihh0coxwosi?t=1m39s ) this past may . 
  questionable quality wikipedia article \u2260 spam, 
  anything \u2264 10 % is n't really political debate worthy . 
  for the rest in italy anything * is fair game if it can be twisted to criticize an adversary . 
  * anything but criticizing the catholic church , that 's pretty much the only real taboo . 
  form whatever coalition , break the government with a vote in parliament and let the king decide instead of reelections ? 
  in the italian system this is possible ( just change king in president of republic ) . 
  was n't this a de facto standard in the uk already ? 
  poor france and belgium :(, 
  dogs cost less then [ spectrometers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/optical_spectrometer ) , that 's why they are used . 
  when going into densely packed areas watch your valuables , this goes for any popular tourist place . 
  smells are nothing else then chemical compounds , and more often then not new perfumes and similar odorous things are under trade secret already . 
  what has happened is more of a bureaucratic change then anything . 
  poland can not even into air :(, 
  and roast meat . 
   hungarian meal i agree with them , why having a lunch consisting of potatoes only ? 
  they are , look at their political agenda . 
  our media do n't like to use words that classify our politics as extremist , but lega nord is as far right as sel is far left . 
  i know people that use tv as background much like a radio , this and other factors probably inflate the numbers . 
  one could argue that [ median ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median ) time would be more representative , and i would agree . 
  i did n't imply that spain is backwards , you 're reading too much into my stupid joke . 
  [ original thread . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3xocij/americans_are_the_worlds_biggest_tv_lovers/cy6g4ps ), 
  you 've worded it ambiguously ( sorry for the pun ) . 
  and internet love to deform statements to their liking . 
  a lot of victims just do n't care enough to report to the police , and `` blocking '' alone can be bypassed . 
  do you think police would deploy for every phone robbery case ? 
  just wait for the eta of that pipe bomb . 
  if on patrol there 's not a moment where all would be cleaning themselves at the same time , sleeping accommodations while on the field do n't require segregation . 
  from the ministry of defence website : [ up to date italian source ] ( http://www.difesa.it/operazionimilitari/op_intern_corso/pagine/operazioni_int.aspx ) , [ less up to date en source ] ( http://www.difesa.it/en/operations/internationaloperations/pagine/internationaloperations.aspx ) . 
   how would you even go about finding that out ? 
  unusually high number of casualties compared to countries with similar military power . 
  done , i was debating on another thread and did n't double check here , thanks . 
  men are unstoppable perverts and women are sluts , yup . 
  ok , let 's put aside italy and let 's take france as an example then . 
   today women make up around 15 % of all service personnel in the combined branches of the french military . 
  they are 11 % of the army forces , 13 % for the navy , 21 % of the air force and 50 % of the medical corps . 
  this is the highest proportion of female personnel in europe . 
  france allows combat roles for females too , and i 'm not aware of any defeat nor loss in efficiency suffered by france where the cause were women . 
  the dead woman was part of a 100 % female nurse unit . 
  injuries are directly related to deaths , an individual more likely to get injured in the first place is also more likely to suffer fatal injuries . 
  if close to none is the amount of women that pass then how is the irrelevant number going to stress the efficiency of the military ? 
  also , the only difference would be the sleeping quarters and shower areas . 
   that was so they could have women to show up . 
  so you have to admit that the test is n't valid . 
  the rest of your answer seems to be in reaction to a misunderstanding . 
  i 'm not advocating a 50:50 gender proportion in the military , but just admit woman to the same * selection programs * as man have . 
  very few woman will pass , and that very few will be on par to the average male soldier . 
  physical and psychological tests should be the determining factors in the admission , not the gender . 
  [ this ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/militari_italiani_caduti_in_missioni_all%27estero#2000 ) is a list of casualties suffered by italian armed forces after woman were allowed to join . 
  there is no correlation between the admission of woman and the amount of victims . 
  with a rigorous selection process only woman fit enough to be on par with their male colleagues are admitted , thus not lowering combat effectiveness . 
  i do n't see where your statements contradict mine . 
  germany is far less likely to vote in favor then france . 
  hell , italy 's more likely than germany . 
  just look at the results of [ un resolution 67/19 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_general_assembly_resolution_67/19#result ), 
   `` the marines created a battalion of 100 female and 300 male volunteers '' these are unrealistic proportions . 
  call me skeptic but i doubt that any force will have 1:3 female to male ratio .
