  are they allowed to smoke on a balcony ? 
  only the children . 
  i 'm scared :(, 
  fantastic , now the responsibility to take migrants is all yours , 
  the lyrics themselves are in an high archaic italian . 
  the song was initially taken in consideration as the anthem but later rejected because the lyrics are not related to italy 's history . 
  during the late 90 's the song was used by the then secessionist lega nord party . 
  [ my version . 
  austria is australian , checks out . 
  it looks so chubby and happy :3, 
  at least that will remove the votes of people that skim without clicking the link . 
  whoa . 
  * we put the bomb in suicide bomber . 
  there should be a filter blocking titles that end in '' ? '', 
  you are allowed . 
  it was n't sarcastic , that fence is there for slowing them down a bit , not blocking them . 
  the dragonja ( ? ), 
  river is the main obstacle . 
  in italy we have a system very similar to sweden : the sex worker is n't a criminal , the client paying for it are . 
  but then again , money coming from prostitution is still considered illegal income . 
  there is close to none political will to better define the situation . 
  ~ ~ it probably had something to do with reddit european 's cdn , some hours ago the error was `` bla bla bla sorry europe '' . ~ ~ nevermind , it was reddit-wide . 
  well mr fancypants , get 15 $ or so and buy shears . 
  congrats , border passed !, 
  ... or jumping over it . 
   nsfd, 
  the labels are not in order . 
  also , mexico is right behind but [ closing in fast ] ( https://i.imgur.com/yw6taue.png ) . 
  you finns and your great fikas . 
  i also like your coffee . 
   top 10 destinations [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/world%e2%80%99s_top_10_tourism_destinations.png ) is the world 's ranking one . 
  6 out of 10 are european countries . 
  eh , the real trinkets are classified . 
  digging your own grave like it 's 1945 . 
  [ savoiardi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ladyfinger_ ( biscuit \\ ) ) are great with milk . 
  you 're not alone , it 's been controversial but quite a lot of people liked it . 
  we already started a field trial in our 3 main cities ( milan , rome and naples ) some months ago , no misuse or deadly accidents happened afaik . 
  iran has quite the ~ ~ florid ~ ~ flourishing black market for alcohol . 
  gib sardinia 2 back . 
   germany refuses to compensate they already settled this decades ago , but greek politicians like to beat the dead horse hoping to find some money . 
  * how to join schengen in 20 easy steps . 
  no need to get so defensive lol, 
  hurray for common sense . 
  extremist ruling parties , right or left does n't matter , are rarely beneficial . 
  and now you 're both tagged as `` happy baltic duo '' . 
   follow the rules motto of every rioters . 
  most atm and other pos ( point of sale ) are on `` windows embedded compact '' formerly `` windows ce '' . 
  yeah , only problem is you need a battalion for every 20 protesters . 
  not really , most communications are on facebook/whatsapp/telegram . 
  local social media is virtually non existent . 
  that 's the key : a hit and run is 1 vehicle . 
  rioters are dozens and can blend with the thousands legitimate protesters . 
  you 've gotten quite close to the answer by yourself : the average italian is gossip-y but resilient to change its habit . 
  absolutely , i tried to find the less sad fact out of this news . 
  most of the violent protesters have their faces covered and manage to flee before getting captured/identified . 
  i like to think of it this way : by making legal guns harder to obtain illegal arms will rise in price . 
  just look around for ( illegal ) weapon costs in the us vs canada . 
  on the bright side it seems that at least 51 have been saved ( google news , last hour ), 
  italians are amongst the least informatized people in europe , this graph reflects it . 
  tunisia has always been one of the most `` westernized '' arab states , even before the arab spring . 
  italy has a lot of economic interests in libya . 
  before the war we had some thousands skilled workers employed by italian companies , mainly in the energy sector ( eni and the universe of smaller businesses gravitating around it ) . 
  now most if not all of the people have come back but the businesses are still interested in not losing their presence there . 
  we 've got [ this one ] ( http://lanuovaferrara.gelocal.it/polopoly_fs/1.12530593.1448808411!/httpimage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/detail_558/image.jpg ) for just 25k . 
  then it would n't be a tank anymore ... eh , i can imagine that someone buying a tank to show off would n't have a collector 's enthusiasm for fidelity . 
  and being unable to go on 95 % existing roads . 
  puny amateurs . 
  rule of thumb : to get a realistic number just divide the protester 's side estimate by 3 and approximate on the high side ( 200.000 --  70000 ), 
  it 's for the euro 2016 cup thing, 
  yeah , two days every four years ( excluding leap ones ) . 
  that is true only in lazio , i 'm not aware of any national law about it . 
   you must pay for the privilege of having to sit down if you 're talking about * coperto * , that 's the fee that pays for employees ' wage . 
  you forgot the `` hon hon hon '' . 
  us victims are 3 % of total casualties ~ 7000 us personnel out of ~ 235000 total military casualties ( iraq + afghanistan + syria wars ) , last couple of years saw close to null us casualties . 
  `` we live in a geographical bog but we do n't want to have tougher measures ! '', 
  or do , they 're more likely to give their life for you . 
  just throw a couple of otters and sweden will panic .

  translated : * pointing up that nobody would be allowed to enter without showing the face . 
  * it 's not a ban , it only reiterates what national law already says . 
  il contravventore e ' punito con l'arresto da uno a due anni e con l'ammenda da 1.000 a 2.000 euro as of now religion is considered valid reason . 
  this law will either be ignored or will be superseded after a recourse . 
  national law , which takes priority over regional , still considers religion a valid reason . 
  false and misleading title . 
  this is a regional law which reinstates what the * codice civile * law 152/1975 says already . 
  misleading because it `` bans '' them only inside public building , not everywhere . 
  false because veiled women , even those with hijab and niqab , are requested to show their faces for identification , then they can cover it again . 
  edit : pinpointed reasons . 
  i 'd suggest page mirror services instead of copy-pasting https://archive.is/k5rzd, 
  we have a word for it , * ecomostro * ( ecologic + monster ) . 
  there are multiple ones in most cities . 
  they 've got to launder their money somewhere . 
  i might be wrong , but afaik criminals are extradited to us states with death penalty , so those rules are not followed 100 %, 
  you are correct . 
  a woman wearing a niqab or hijab has to show her face to be identified then she can cover it again . 
  the law is redundant but newsworthy since it shows the attitude towards those people . 
  march 25th , 2016 `` prime minister 's a340 has taken off '', 
  the course with the longest duration is [ 30 days theoretic + 14 days practical ] ( http://www.srtechnics.com/datas/docs/tt_specialised_training_a340_cfm56.pdf ) training . 
  i 'm confident that the plane will be used for official flights at most this next spring .
