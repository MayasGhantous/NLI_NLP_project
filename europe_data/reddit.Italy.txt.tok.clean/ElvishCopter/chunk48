  i ca n't fathom how one can get clean without it , wet wipes are not an effective alternative . 
  like others have already said the cost of making clothes for the masses in the eu is too high .

  i said so ( `` after the liberation of the city '' ) . 
  those were germans that went into hiding to avoid being captured by partisans , most soldiers preferred surrendering to regular forces . 
  they are actively encouraging people to snoop around , reporting to the police means that a somewhat dubious situation has happened . 
  people will report any presumably suspect activity without any training on what suspect means , invading people privacy in the meantime . 
  this is too similar to the inquisition . 
  the idea is good , but i imagine flanders-like people that will invade the privacy of honest people . 
  i 'm not really sure if the trade off will be positive . 
  also , using untrained personnel will generate too much noise in their reports imho . 
  both are perfectly reasonable reactions to a stressful situation , it 's the degree of the reaction that should be considered , not the kind . 
  in retrospect yeah , i would 've thought the same . 
   26 jun 1944 , paris , france -- members of the french resistance movement arrest germans in hiding throughout paris , after the liberation of the city by the allied forces in 1944 .

  italy has a comprehensive high quality health coverage , it can be slow but this is because virtually everyone can use it . 
  we also have a balanced diet , no extreme climate and low stress life . 
  the same goes for spain , but they have a more arid climate . 
  our navy , with support from frontex , detects them way before they approach territorial waters . 
  the treat here is that lybia is a mess and coordinating with them for repatriation is essentially impossible . 
  world powers are focused on syria while essentially ignoring libya , the main naval route for illegal immigration into europe and terrorist training ground .

  you could go to new york , it 's a giant melting pot . 
  no wait , buying a yacht and cruising to europe would be less expensive , never mind . 
  an efficient repatriation system will also be needed , or we 'll have to mine the mediterranean . 
  have you tried looking at other italian universities ? 
  depending on your course type there might be a well rated university in a city with extensive roman architecture . 
  even then , what foreign media says is just a fraction of what happens domestically , it 's unfeasible to cover every news of every country . 
  it 's the same in italy , the frightening part in this case is the * preemptive * house arrest . 
  afaik just by being notified , not even arrested , a single time to the authorities you could be forbidden to participate indefinitely in any manifestation . 
  this if the actual rules become permanent , which seems very likely to happen . 
  a french citizen with a clean criminal record that ca n't manifestate means that france is not a free state anymore . 
   public demonstrations are banned this measure is too extreme to be permanent . 
  so will it become normal to house arrest people before manifestations ? 
  this is frightening . 
   hassan el alaoui , who is in charge of nominating regional and local muslim imams and mediating between the imams and prison officials --  `` they are run illegally without proper licenses , they preach hatred , or use takfiri speech '' , he said . 
  this is the right course of action . 
  what worries me is that for at least those 3 months authorities will have little to no oversight . 
  alright , but and excessive error shows that one 's perception of reality is too distorted .

   illuminati also noted that italy could question the fairness of the trial illuminati confirmed ? 
  no , but just look at europe , if import tax were to be completely removed most low and middle cost products will be outsourced , causing more unemployment , and unemployed people are a cost to society . 
  why wo n't those unemployed people get more qualifications ? 
  even if they did higher level positions are limited in numbers , so they would still be unemployed .

   77 % of adults from families in the top income quartile earned at least bachelor 's degrees by the time they turned 24 , up from 40 % in 1970 . 
  9 % of people from the lowest income bracket , up from 6 % in 1970 . 
  and the increase has been 52 % for the richest and 33 % for the poorest . 
   most of the poor students who pursue college degrees fail to make it all the way to graduation . 
  20 % from the lowest income bracket completed a bachelor 's degree by age 24 in 2013 . 
  among students from top-earning families 99 % of students who enrolled completed their degrees . 
  the average poor student has 80 % chance to fail , the richest just 1 % [ source ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/big-gap-in-college-graduation-rates-for-rich-and-poor-study-finds-1422997677 ) [ mirror without paywall ] ( https://archive.is/2htwj ), 
  yes , because with such a match cost of life would also be massively different . 
  i do n't know about you but i think that we should n't aim about the lowest common denominator . 
  to make money you need money , and to have that you need an affordable education . 
  i 've also heard that programs need to be frequently renewed , and this implies irregularity for at least the coverage if not also for the quality . 
  and this indeed has marginal importance .
