   failing to reach france , migrants settle for italy ftfy, 
  this . 
  but another side of me tells that the immigration megathread is useless and simply make people avoid the matter . 
  there is enough censorhip as it is . 
  in the city : * a cottage like [ this ] ( http://images1.it.reastatic.net/800x600/props/36036/26643206/1/zm0mjxp.jpg ) ( 160 m ^ 2 / 1720 ft ^ 2 ) * or an apartment like [ this one ] ( http://images1.it.reastatic.net/800x600/props/191533/29117491/9/7qmkhv0.jpg ) ( 125 m ^ 2 / 1345 ft ^ 2 ) . 
  * out of the city : [ this house ] ( http://images1.it.reastatic.net/800x600/props/256460/29004323/1/vqbq09f.jpg ) ( 150 m ^ 2 / 1614 ft ^ 2 + 2 parking spots ) 5 min from the city . 
   our ** sexy president hollande ** [ rawr ] ( http://www.pensezbibi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/hollande-sexy.jpg ) . 
  ** italy ** - 49 people died and 312 rescued in yet another shipwreck , 40 of those deaths were by suffocation because of being locked in the `` ship '' 's lower deck . 
  - the catholic church is criticizing our politicians for `` poor handling of the migrant crisis '' , now the matter has just become a shouting match - fiumicino airport back to 100 % efficiency - a man who saved two swimmers died of fatigue and another one got one arm cut off by a speedboat, 
  well , it was just sicily ... but then again , they had obsolete rifles and no gunpowder . 
  and the people were already revolting by their own . 
  doggie spot something . 
  oh britain , you and your quirky laws . 
  did you expect something funny ? 
  it 's the uk we 're talking about .

  those trains have a punch-in-the-eye color scheme , and i thought we had ugly trains , bleh . 
  it 's a tl ; dr for the lazy , not my opinion . 
  btw : never said that china is or is n't anything , even less a beacon of freedom . 
  out of curiosity : have you read the article ? 
  well , socialism is deeply rooted the french culture , but generally speaking right wing parties are gaining more support in the recent years . 
  [ screenshot if the paywall blocks you .

  germany is also rich . 
  china friend of germany for moneys . 
  incremental rise of trading both ways . 
  usa mad at china because it weakens their dominant position . 
  china relationship with europe is at a peak but because of human rights and tolerance of war in other countries this may change . 
  they are coocoo in their head by making pornhub take down a free * positive * ad . 
  by the way : [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31mazo6hgjs ) to the ad . 
  also : apparently they re-published it with the name bleeped off but i ca n't find a source for that . 
  l\u00f6l , this will surely b\u00f6\u00f6st turism in finl\u00e4nd . 
  nice pellelleyed btw . 
  if we really want to go down this road at least read the data correctly :  looking at foreigners committing crimes [ ... ]  in 2009 [ ... ] the first three nationalities ( romania , morocco and albania ) are 38,1 % ( was 47,1 % in 1992 ) . 
  that actually means a reduction in crime rate in the last 17 years up to the polling time ( data are 5 years old btw ) . 
   actually romanians are the nationality that compared to the population commit more crimes of course they are , there are * more * of them , everything regarding them is going to be bigger in * absolute * numbers . 
  does n't mean that a romanian is more likely to be a criminals compared to any other nationalities . 
  you 're the one who needs to pay taxes for two years in one , right ? 
  cornuto is barely an insult , it 's quite mild and specific . 
  here are the most common swear words ( excluding region specific ones ) : * vaffanculo ( fuck you ) * cazzo ( cock ) * troia / puttana ( bitch ) * merda ( shit ) bonus round : a couple of blasphemous swear words , level 3000 insults . 
  * porco dio ( fuck you , god ) * madonna troia / puttana ( whore mother of jesus ), 
  this almost looks like a reunification waiting to happen . 
  til, 
  good to know , but the data i put is from registered foreign residents , and to become one identity papers have to be used . 
  so , unless the majority of them forged their documents , there 's no meaning in including them . 
  close , they 're around 150000 an counting . 
  but moldovans are n't romanian , even if the border moved quite a lot . 
  romanian by far (  1,3 millions over a population of 55mil italians ) , they are 1,81 % of our total residents and 25 % of the minorities . 
  for the most part they are well integrated , there 's really nothing to say about them . 
  we do have a problem with gypsies , they are heavily discriminated against and it 's incredibly hard for them to integrate . 
  they are given patches of land where to settle , but usually with little to none access to gas/electricity/water . 
  those camps commonly become hubs of illicit activities , mostly pickpockets and home invaders . 
  this needs to change but little is done , our politicians like to just pity them or straightly use them to channel fears . 
  -- not really relevant : we also have a quite a lot of ukrainians for some reason . 
  edit : added discrimination factor to the gypsies part . 
  oh well , i got proved wrong . 
  wow , i 'm in awe, 
  lol , what the fuck is that ? 
  i think i fell in love with it . 
  there are fewer buttons in the same area , take the stick as a reference . 
  switches and knobs look more distanced then the other two jets ' and the screens look less visible . 
  the button on centre stick that looks like the one for deploying payload/shooting seems to require much more hand movement . 
  i 'm in no way an expert on avionics , mine is just a judgment on usability . 
  eurofighter 's controls are a mess . 
  that poor soul , props for the endurance tho / s seriously : i think it 's mainly caused by more people reporting it , the actual number did n't change too much imho . 
  put a regional filter on it so ru addresses could not see it . 
  i think he 's saying the margin of profit from the scam was 5k . 
  for what i understand the car was insured for 240k . 
  losses = [ current resell value 190k + scam cost 45k ] = 235k [ insurance gives 240k - losses ] = 5k, 
  suck up buttercup and just block the user . 
  this new crime is ridiculous . 
  i think croatian are too hard on themselves . 
  i do n't think we have it either . 
   \\ #internlivesmattertoo this should actually be a thing . 
  hey , this is a big deal !, 
  liechtenstein is the main producer of false teeth in the world . 
  how can the crackheads at the kremlin cope with this ban ? 
  not portugal , you did a great job at it . 
  it is as simple as it can be : if people are well they do n't want change . 
  sorry but this is awfully formatted . 
  anyway : poorer nations want more integration while richer ones are interested in maintaining the status quo , nothing mind blowing . 
  yes , but it 's an anti-russian censorship :p, 
  i 'd speculate that the average user of reddit most likely knows about it . 
  it 's a nerdy community after all . 
   if you know the enemy and know yourself , you need not fear the result of a hundred battles . 
  if you know yourself but not the enemy , for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat . 
  greece is the enemy . 
  seems plausible / s, 
  it 's extremely cynical , but in order to have stability in eu areas of interest there needs to be either a friendly dictatorship or a will to spend much more resources . 
  no government is willing to spend a lot of resources when a dictatorship far from home can be put in power . 
  sad , but until we are dependent on petrol and precious mineral it 's actually economically favorable , not on an human level , for us to have dictatorships ( syria , what used to be lybia , congo ... ) . 
  it 's either this or having to lower our living standards to favor other countries fairer development . 
  it does n't have to be physical assets at all , if it comes to be financial products could be seized . 
  agree , air strikes alone ca n't win a war , there needs to be ground troops too . 
  and a transitional force after the hypothetical war is won . 
  russia is doing a good job at that ( chechnya , crimea ) , albeit not giving people freedom . 
  looks good , if you make that a little more high quality it might allow you to be an approved submitter on / r/polanball  and write the text with the paint text tool , this is a must for them .
