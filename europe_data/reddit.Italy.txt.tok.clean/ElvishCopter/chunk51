  because they would lose most of eu clients , and revenues would plummet . 
  privacy is not the factor that influences ms choices . 
  because history regards people , not theories . 
  scientific * procedures * are even on a whitelist basis if their application could damage something / someone ( think the rules about medical procedures or engineering regulations ) . 
  historical denial and discrimination are intertwined in some cases , like extreme situations like genocides , if allowed it cultivates discrimination . 
  the historical community consensus , just like scientific theories . 
  with this i 'm not saying that any little fact should be regulated , but denial of genocidal scale should not be allowed . 
  microsoft is also being proactive against eu legislation that one day or another will force providers to host sensitive data within eu legislation . 
  there are no white knights in the corporation world , at most grey ones . 
  freedom of speech ends when it becomes blatant history denial or discrimination . 
  ( blatant refers to both nouns , mind you ), 
  spain just has few kilometers of flat grounds to control , but i see what you 're coming from . 
  \\ # 7 is true for me .

  even if border control with austria is put in place it will hardly work , go outside of major roads and it 's all woodlands and mountains . 
  they used to be common contraband routes in the 50s and 60s . 
  just remove erdo\u011fan , the low intensity war against the kurds , ~ ~ death penalty ~ ~ and you 'll get straight in . 
   the special permit of stay can be continuous or seasonal . 
  in the first case `` continuous '' when the applicant has a job contract for an indefinite period of time , the second case `` seasonal '' when the applicant has a job contract for a max . 
  length of 10 months . 
  the continuous permit of stay is granted by the state congress . 
  the seasonal permit of stay can be requested by the applicant to the foreign office of gendarmerie after a control of the commission of jobs ( commissione di collocamento ) shows no possibilities to find in the official list of job skilled personnel as requested . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.sanmarinosite.com/en/infos/residence-permit/ ) if you have further question / r/italy *** might *** know more , but i do n't know of any active italian that works in sm there .

  eh , i dared being pro kosovo and got a worse reaction then you had :p, 
  eh , anti-discrimination for essentially anything is in our constitution since after wwii . 
  on top of that , until a few months ago we had probably the most pro-employee law in the world and lawsuits for work discrimination were extremely rare . 
  unless a company expressly says the cause for not hiring x is x being gay/female etc they can hire whomever , the classic `` we 'll let you know '' will always work . 
  and if a company wants to fire someone because x is discovered lgbt even the more pro-employee law has limits ( eg : keep same pay but give a demeaning role / shape an unsustainable stressful role ) . 
  the average ukranian is n't really swimming in money . 
  oh sweden , even your hip-hop artists have viking beards . 
  well , psychiatrists and psychologists are bound to secrecy by the law , your friends are n't :p, 
  well , julius caesar was pretty badass . 
  from the official european website : http://ec.europa.eu/about/index_en.htm it 's the top result for `` how the commissioners are elected '' , a phrase you wrote in this same thread :p, 
  paging / u/hvpd23 and / u/capryolo, 
  same happened a few days ago for a man convicted in the baldo museum massacre , but we * may * deport him to morocco ... and what morocco does is not our business . 
  monsieur joseph-ignace guillotin ? 
  i think you went in the most `` tip aware '' eu country lol , if you have 10 minutes skim whototip.net , it gives do an do n't for most european countries . 
   carabinieri police launched dawn raids for the arrest of 17 people on thursday as part of an anti-terrorism operation conducted with other european police forces , [ newspiece here ] ( http://www.ansa.it/english/news/general_news/2015/11/12/dawn-terrorism-operation-17-arrests_e4dff52f-6623-4b56-8922-ce6c8895546a.html ), 
  somewhat related : few days ago the us gave green light to weaponize two italian predator drones ( one a + and one b + ), 
  absolutely , if one has funds the us is the place to live in . 
  1901 - guglielmo marconi receives the first transatlantic radio signal ( the letter `` s '' [ *** ] in morse code ) * science bitch !, 
  we look so * ssssleek *,

  the square looked better before :( i like the flowers, 
  yes , but you have conscription . 
  all swiss are trained for proper use and care . 
  is `` university tourism '' a thing in germany ? 
  i could see an average person willing to travel abroad to get a degree he/she ca n't at home . 
  here too . 
  or paying one of the many homeless people to get you some . 
  ah , you 're from prato !, 
  this is an irish cover . 
  not even saliva ? 
  / r/comcast , just look at what 's hot there, 
  well , i think most finn shops accept cards . 
  i do n't think cash is essential anymore , at least in north eu , get a debit card and you are golden in every mid and bigger size shops and most smaller ones . 
  it 's the same here , you can live an honest life with your wage as a waiter . 
  generally people here are less extrovert , so we appreciate a waiter that is n't as nosy as an us one . 
  it was a propaganda poster of 10 + years ago really , now their policy is just `` help them at their home '' and getting italy away from the eu . 
  there is no `` polluting the race '' rhetoric . 
  imperialism as a concept has become an obsolete concept altogether , except for russia . 
  the only significant `` invasion '' acts are countries hoping to snatch natural resources . 
  well , production was licensed by the government . 
  it 's not including the revenue form legal production that got them in trouble . 
  if $ 3m tax evasion is worth posting here then i should post something every week . 
  i thought i specified * in italy * , my bad . 
  aloe creams are also nice ... 
  i think i heard it from the same guy as you . 
  i 'll back anything that helps isp competition , having 3 major providers all with fo ownership is keeping prices at bay .

  well , tipping is huge in the us but not in the eu . 
  also , if you follow / r/personalfinance a lot of stories are about struggling economically due to health bills which afaik is not a thing in any eu country . 
  this is a valid point . 
  i stand corrected , i do n't know other countries ' legal system details . 
  maybe with military personnel under vacation leave ? 
  do n't think in `` depth '' , but `` width '' . 
  not only people guilty of rape crimes would need to be deported , but at least every other violent criminal . 
  i ca n't think of a legal scenario where rape gets treated more harshly then murder . 
  and good luck convincing other countries to accept your rapists and murderers . 
  so you want exile for crimes committed by british citizens in british territory ? 
  this opens the door of exile to anyone that is guilty of a penal offence , and is just impossible to do so . 
  let 's hope the next one will stay in power and gets to create useful reforms ... but the rise in populist movement makes me pessimistic . 
  i 'm on your side , but you 're acting like an idiot now . 
  happened not more than a week ago in rome too , they had good disaster prevention in place so no real damage was done .
