  yeah , i realized it was crap shortly after . 
  carry on mr. bot, 
  and i do n't think i 've ever seen an * \u00e9 * in written italian in the last 5 years . 
  i like his ability to stay rational . 
  the weak link here is the key ( hardware or software is insignificant in this context ) that is used to encrypt the fingerprint . 
  afaik it 's closed source so we ca n't know how safe it really is . 
  edit : apparently you can also lock the touch id with a complex password , this is reassuring . 
   asked to assess his successor , mr. kohl , he was characteristically withering . 
   `` i think there are still two or three fields in which he still needs a lot of education , '' he told the times . 
  asked which ones , he answered , `` international affairs , arms control and military strategy , and economics and finance . '' ha . 
  a tl ; dr for the non german folk ? 
  something 's off : ireland 's petroleum is at 100.2 % do they pump oil back into the earth ? 
  but those cute sad african babies :( the tv told me to give them money so i did . 
  if you 're homeless it 's your fault because you 're lazy !, 
  ^ ^ ^ / s ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ someone ^ ^ ^ did n't ^ ^ ^ catch ^ ^ ^ that, 
  how 's that he still has his seat ? 
  for a party having your leader at 26 % means they all go down with him . 
  does n't happen every day that someone gets killed by the blast from half a ton of tnt ... 
  ouch , that 's insane . 
  maybe you could you save something by getting your pc from amazon de or some other german retailer ... besides that i ca n't really think of a solution . 
  is n't it good for export tho ? 
  here it 's even worse , lol, 
  it 's up !, 
  i 'm downloading a clip of right now , edit should take no more then 30 minutes . 
  i have 3mb upload tho , uploading could take an hour . 
  edit : damn this anchor has near perfect enunciation , i do n't know if i can gather anything . 
  most of them mask the inspiration on `` s '' and `` e '' sounds . 
  oh , come on . 
  half of the breath ins were of interviewed people , not news anchor :p that said i 'm going to make a video in the same stile in a few , i like the idea . 
  edit : [ here 's my version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c9ynpyie0e ), 
  if you manage to get a majority of my house against me and they decide to declare indipendence then you 're welcome . 
   the more polite all of our users are in these amas , the higher the chances are that we 'll be able to get more and better amas in the future . 
  you have my permission to go berserk on moderating the ama thread :p, 
   by that logic everyone should , no matter the circumstances , become a member of unesco because it will happen anyway by natures hand . 
  yes , art and history should be preserved regardless of the nation they happen to be in , [ the countries that recognize kosovo ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/countriesrecognizingkosovo.png ) are enough to consider the country legitimized for this kind of support . 
   why should destroyers of my cultural heritage suddenly become protectors ( and get money ) of it ? 
  the right of nations to self-determination gives them ownership over their land , holding grudges is pointless . 
  it 's because the 90s saw judges [ giovanni falcone ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giovanni_falcone ) and [ paolo borsellino ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paolo_borsellino ) finally start an effective fight to overthrow the mafia . 
  1992 and 1993 saw multiple terror attack from [ cosa nostra ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sicilian_mafia ) against important state figures . 
  this season of terror peaked with the successful killings of the two judges in two separate but close in time bombing attacks . 
  bombing aftermaths : [ paolo borsellino 's here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/c/cd/viad%27amelio_strage.jpg ) and [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/d/d7/strage_di_via_d%27amelio.jpg ) , [ giovanni falcone 's here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/4/4d/strage_di_capaci.jpg ) the surge in violence was caused by the desire from the mafia to have less intense prosecution . 
  there have been and still are investigations and criminal trials against people that were believed to have at least partially yielded to mafia 's request . 
  that will happen by nature 's hand to dozens of other monuments and churches if no funds are directed to their preservation . 
   * the tunisian , who has since been sent back to his country * he was sent back and he 's not in eu territory anymore , the title is incomplete . 
  ah , how nice when nationalistic sentiments trump the conservation of historical heritage . 
  regardless of the political meaning that man committed arson , and looking at his past he does n't look completely stable . 
  max legal amount here is 20ml ( 0,67 oz ) per bottle with no more then 10 % oil and 2.5 % capsaicin product . 
  most if not all legal non lethal weapon outside of the us are n't really effective for self defense . 
  i 'm not saying pepper spray is completely useless , but alone it 's not sufficient for a good defense . 
  at most pepper spray causes the attacker to struggle , and not immediately . 
  he or she will still be able to hit while fueled by adrenaline . 
  and physical contact will happen anyway if one is going to be raped . 
  krav maga would work if one is already decently fit and that 's why i also cited passive martial arts , if the move is successful the opponent is on the ground and the victim can flee . 
  tasers work a lot better then pepper spray , but a lot of countries consider them too powerful . 
  i guess pepper spray is better then nothing , but if one is worried about rape krav maga or passive martial arts are way more effective . 
  do sport or hunting shops sell wildlife spray ? 
  in no way i condone violent crimes , but i ca n't really see in what scenario civilian issue pepper spray can be in any way a defense against a violent person . 
  edit : my comment is on legally obtainable sprays in my country , which are strictly regulated and have a fraction of the strength of the us ones . 
  the website 's design looks so 2007, 
  depends on the subreddit really . 
  and i think italy 's taxation is n't * per se * a problem as much as it is the overwhelming bureaucracy and the incompetent state organs that a business has to interact every day . 
  * why did n't i ever think of this ? 
  absolutely . 
  nothing with an international scale is black and white . 
  i agree with you / s, 
  [ photo story of the clashes ] ( https://imgur.com/a/5f5wj ), 
  suck it france ... :(, 
   have like 2-3 hours a week ayup , here too . 
  and on top of that i do n't know of anybody that lost a year due to low marks in english . 
  let 's just say that the head of the pentagon ca n't really be impartial on this matter ... 
  fyi : this is a repost of this [ 3 month old thread in this same sub . ], 
  ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dqg70/percentage_of_people_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social/?ref=search_posts ) you might think this is new but the article that you saw in / r/italy used this same image . 
  now i 'm hungry for lasagna at 2:20 , thank you :|, 
   ( approx 10m2 ) a 3x3 meter square ? 
  i do n't mind about the double post . 
   the average response rate was 71.7 % , but in france it reached just 45.9 % , making the french sample unrepresentative in terms of size . 
  this was an already filtered pool , if more then half chose not to answer the results ( for france ) are n't really meaningful . 
  cheap vacation in the countryside . 
  the first thing i thought was * agriturismo * ( farmhouses in the countryside converted to small size hotels ) . 
  sometimes they are converted from barns . 
   percentage of its adult population taking antidepressants . 
  not really , [ france places 9th in europe ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/2013/nov/20/mental-health-antidepressants-global-trends ) ( hover on the map to see \u2030 ) . 
  all of northern europe + spain and portugal uses more antidepressants . 
  if we want to over simplify you could say that the north is more fast paced and organized , while the south is more relaxed and has the best food . 
  the center is a mix of the two . 
  but really , any region has an unique feel to it . 
  think of italy 's regioni as us states . 
  https://i.imgur.com/gm1ddur.jpg people can be assholes , do n't feel discouraged . 
  having less hours of work per week then most of the world is also a huge factor in reducing psychophysical stress . 
  step 1 : do n't be a stereotypical american . 
  that 's it . 
   20 000 people were illegally actively wiretapped that 's terrifying considering the size of macedonia . 
  almost anyone that had power was spied . 
  to make decent money out of farming ( or really any other commodity ) you need massive investments , and let 's just say that romania is n't the best place for it . 
  be strong . 
  well , to be fair it 's 4 teams , one for each florence district , and direct elimination . 
  the winner team gets a free dinner , they used to get a cow but not anymore . 
  you still have an uncontaminated nature and maybe the best education system in the world . 
   some people in europe will start living again with candles and wood ovens , like it 's the middle ages all over again !, 
  hmm , we should market this to hipsters .
