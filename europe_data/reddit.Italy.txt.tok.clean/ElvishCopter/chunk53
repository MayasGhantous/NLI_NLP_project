  pfft , swamp football . 
  [ calcio fiorentino ] ( http://media-s3.blogosfere.it/rugby1823/images/calcio_storico_fiorentino.jpg ) is a 27 vs 27 match on dry sand , everything bar intentional injuring is ok there . 
  i could n't live without your metal tho . 
  carminati is being accused of : - mafia consipracy - blackmail - illegal money transfer - corruption - auction rigging - fake invoicing he has a past in far right extremism . 
  he was condemned for armed robbery and was also accused but later acquitted ( under not so clear circumstances ) for his part in various murders . 
  what a nice person . 
  their parents ? 
  yes , yes . 
  my bad, 
  an adult can be the recipient of a gift basket . 
  this ban regards all gift baskets . 
  the chance of being victim of a terror attack are still minuscule if you stick to tourist areas . 
  only 1 flight got blown up over the hundreds that flew that day in egypt . 
  and tunisia : only few hundred people over the tens of thousands in tunisia those days were actually directly under terror threat . 
  i absolutely agree , but also recognize that the world is full of people that do n't like to be faced with reality . 
  you asked the reason of all that downvotes and i gave it to you . 
   i wonder why the downvotes i suppose because some see it as a romanian thing and not europe-y . 
  it 's also sad , and some people do n't like to see sad things . 
  that 's not an overreaction at all . 
  i was referring to the historic attitude of greek politicians , greece did n't get into unbearable debt in a couple of years . 
  i do n't want to judge the measures that have been taken in recent years as i do n't know enough about economics to have an informed opinion . 
  it 's sad , but the fact that those people had the luxury of free power shows how poorly the greek state managed , and stil manages , the little money it has . 
   ngos call on german banks to stop funding coal * in the philippines, 
  yup , typical dust explosion : a lot of powder in the air + friction + closed space = [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iikk0d2tuu8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=12s ) change the rocket with inappropriate ventilation ( ie cooling ) or even heat from fermenting flour on a poorly cleaned container and you get 5 blown out silos . 
   bread factory flour stored in high quantities is a ticking time bomb if stored poorly . 
  i hope that romania will be more concerned about safety measures following this bleak event . 
  stereotypes towards people come and go as waves , at least here . 
  as of now eastern european are n't seen as a major cause of concern at all . 
  now the most discriminated people are black africans, 
  there there , european korea . 
  tl ; dr nothing is going to change . 
  nothing being discussed is mandatory . 
  1911 , italy annexed [ tripoli and cyrenaica ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/map_of_traditional_provinces_of_libye-en.svg/250px-map_of_traditional_provinces_of_libye-en.svg.png ) but did n't knew that lybia was ripe with petrol . 
  we mainly used lybia as a. . . farm . 
  `` lituania '' , just because it 's the same as italian :p . more objectively , the word stays essentially the same , the only change is *** th *** -  *** t ***, 
  if you like firefox look at their forks , i like cyberfox the most , but waterfox is a valid alternative too , albeit less frequently updated . 
  look at the versions optimized for your architecture ( amd , intel ... ) i can make them run swiftly on a crappy netbook i have . 
  use cyberfox on a laptop only if you have decent cooling , it squeezes every ounce of power from a processor to run swiftly . 
  haha , we had that already . 
  and voice traffic for 24 months , but `` only '' for isps , not every website . 
  now i 'm sad . 
  fyi : chrome is maybe the browser that tracks you the most . 
  our review is quite depressing ... 
  \\ # 1 looks like chili powder, 
  [ ouch ] ( http://cdn.myhealthtips.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/easy-home-remedies-for-minor-burns.jpg ), 
   he had 1500 police escorts in only one year how is this even possible ? 
  it 's more then 4 every day , was his cousin 's niece escorted too ? 
  that looks delicious , is the white slab a chunk of cheese , goat maybe ? 
  \\ # 1 style is nice , but i do n't like that it shows an animal . 
  i think that the logo of a city should be an object or abstract figure . 
  i really like # 6 style . 
  # 7 follows closely . 
  it 's going to basically be alcoholic now lol . 
  i 'm ignorant on the matter , but could n't you just experiment with a vm and a virtual hard disk ? 
  production of fetish porn yes , i was imprecise . 
  but the point still stands . 
  this is the same as the uk-produced fetish porn from a few months ago , lol . 
   no-one has produced any evidence of casual curiosity on part of the security services . 
  what an empty declaration . 
  counter-terrorism measures have no oversight it 's impossible to prove that all of their work is legitimate . 
  the nsa leaks show that not 100 % of a secret agency action is legitimate . 
  the uk gov ' t measures will just have the effect that real terrorists will use non-uk software , which afaik they are already doing . 
  it 's clear that those two sold the stolen documents to the book writers , if they wanted data to be publicly available they would have gotten on a wikileaks-like road . 
  honestly i 'm still on the whistleblower 's side , the vatican is rotten to the core . 
  inb4  knowing what websites i look at and not which pages is useless . 
  not for behavioral analysis . 
  uk 's police will be able to link every person to certain websites , and use this for behavioral prediction models . 
  imo they throw `` innocent until proven guilty '' out of the window . 
  eli5 : if they know what you look at they will be able to predict your `` risk level '' , eg : do you visit a lot of websites with extreme content ? 
  then you 're more likely to repeat what you look at . 
  we want to play the blame game ? 
  [ anyone who fought to take down geddafi ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6opdqso.png ) is guilty then . 
  us and canada fought in libya too . 
   gypsum minerals too ? 
  damn , they 're everywhere . 
   most swedes would take a century to repay mortgages at current rates . 
  -  20 percent annual rise in the cost of apartments . 
  * pop * goes the bubble . 
  i expressed my opinion on an * hypothetical * situation and the us is maybe the country who invaded more sovereign nations in recent history ...  libya is a sovereign country and you ca n't just go in there anymore than smugglers imo lybia and italy are legally on the same level , but i regards my country , hell any country with a government that can control its territory , on an higher level then a territory with 3 ( 4 including tuareg ) factions fighting each other . 
  edit : corrected autocorrect, 
  italia forte . 
  never mind , flair 's gone . 
  thanks for the link tho , [ beautiful sight . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/curving_meanders_in_special_nature_reserve_uvac_river_canyon_valley%2c_serbia.jpg ), 
  i do n't understand what the flair means . 
  even if what libya said is true , which i highly doubt : so ? 
  they are doing close to nothing to stop smugglers , someone must . 
   ethiopia is not certain death . 
  i agree 90 % of what you said . 
  but ethiopia is a ruthless dictatorship, 
  one thing i 'd like them to do is to publish a detailed list of their dmca/eucd complaints . 
  if they do i 'll really consider switching to it . 
  it 's the default search engine for the tor browser project , i trust it more then most search engines . 
  remember ? 
  we have a wart . 
  slovenia does n't . 
  i was n't offended lol , i just took his tone as cold norwegian humour . 
   italians are basically muslim by / r/europe 's standards funny enough we are have probably the lowest % of muslims in central-western europe . 
  finally some good news , 
  thanks,
