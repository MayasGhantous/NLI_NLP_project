   sex ed curiculuum i wish our schools had that , but the state is bent over the vatican 's will . 
  we lag a generation behind on the sphere of social rights . 
  this article is poorly written , i was confused at first too . 
   on the question of whether their country had taken in enough foreign migrants and whether there was room for more [ ... ] 14 % of germans felt the same way . 
  this poll has no graph , look at the sentence alone . 
   say , just approximately , water 20 $ , electricity 25 $ , heating 60 $ ( averaged over the year ) , public transport for both adults 45 $ , for both kids 20 $ . 
  internet , tv 25 $ , garbage 8 $ . 
  ( and i 'm sure there are other costs i 'm forgetting now ) food , rent/loan ? 
  we are not rich but also not poor , and still ... 
  well , i was about to throw shit to this post but this just sounds reasonable . 
  i ca n't really complain now . 
   restriction of family reunification agree . 
  is it by direct blood descendance/marriage everywhere ? 
  ( at most a married couple , sons and daughters , parents ), 
  kurd 's favorite holiday . 
  i 'm surprised by france , is n't it a relatively welcoming country for political refugees and the like ? 
  i 'm in favor of helping asylum seekers , not illegal economic migrants , they have to follow the regular route . 
  ca n't afford it ? 
  i 'm sorry but that 's none of our business . 
  true , i 'll add that south tyrol is culturally more austrian then italian , and has an efficient region all-around so people do n't dislike their actual state of being . 
  it 's 4,20 $ before taxes , mind you . 
  this leaves us with about 2,31 $ ( corruption fee not included ), 
  fyi : our dark brown areas have been historically more left-leaning . 
  ha , we still have it , up to [ 5000 $ ] ( http://www.governo.it/presidenza/usri/confessioni/doc/legge_240206.pdf ) ( articolo 11 comma 1 ), 
  they are supposed to support the official government , in this case erdo\u011fan 's . 
  well , most of italy is touristic , but i can point you to [ asinara island ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/asinara ) . 
  it 's a very well preserved 50km ^ 2 natural park just north of sardinia . 
  because of its very delicate ecosystem ( and low profitability , it 's a park ) promotions are almost null . 
  tickets for a day visit range from 20 to 50 $ / person . 
  the island has herds of [ albino donkeys ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/asinello_bianco_sardegna_asinara_3593693026_750d1054eb_o.jpg ) and an uncontaminated maquis shrubland . 
  i know that 's not a city , but even depressing industrial cities have history here :p, 
  i doubt that our representatives even know what an internet is , that 's depressing . 
  their library is laughable . 
  fuck , now i 'm tempted to use a wireless portable box for my music . 
  i just hope that something like that already exist . 
  if not , well fuck raspberry pi/arduino will do the job . 
  fair enough , thinking more about it we should reach a germany-like acknowledgment no later than 2016 and we are at 55 %, 
  i suppose that having a dictatorship end so late made them more open to adopt more liberal ideas . 
  looking at those numbers it seems that 65 % is the threshold to reach for having marriage equality . 
  they are one of the most catholic oriented states , second only to the vatican and italy . 
  ( spain has a major catholic presence but imo they are way more open the those other countries ) . 
   the imaginative conservative offers to our families , our communities , and the republic , a conservatism of hope , grace , charity , gratitude and prayer . 
  let him who is without sin cast the first stone . 
  at least bbc is less partial then that source . 
   the results are regular , albeit smaller , h. 264 files that can be played by end users without any need for additional plug-ins . 
  - [ source 2 ] ( http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/08/netflix-1080p-streams-no-longer-called-x-high-company-credits-i/ )  increases detail on `` textures , shadows , skies , and particularly faces '' seems like they optimized h264 ( and h265 too , for 4k at least i suppose ) for noisy surfaces . 
  marketable , but not ground-breaking . 
  no , * unless * the war ends and their economy gets way more stable . 
  for the sake of information : l'espresso is a center-left paper . 
   the company said it did not know how much of their customer information had been * encrypted * . 
  what the f ** k , i hope that 's a typo . 
  tl ; dr v2 : netflix & co. will pay more to offer us the same services , reducing their profit margin . 
  end users could get to pay * slightly * more as a consequence of netflix raising its prices to remain profitable . 
  he 's just a hoser :p, 
  definitely denmark . 
  nordic enough but not depressingly cold and dark like the other scandinavian countries , 
   likely the most advanced compression in the world [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netflix#streaming ) eli5 : they use h264 and h265 99 % of the time , they `` just '' adopted what was already available . 
   chill i like to think it was intentional . 
  telecom italia here too , can confirm speed drops at night . 
  this was a very interesting post indeed , i tip my hat to you . 
  north korea likes this . 
  the meetup is at the radio tower , right ? 
  / r/botrights, 
   but ca n't the italian parliament remove that for any single politician where they deem it ~ ~ necessary ~ ~ convenient ? 
  ftfy technically yes . 
  to be more precise : after internal investigation the chamber votes on the member 's immunity and if the majority agrees the sentence and/or judiciary investigation is executed . 
  an arrest/investigation on a member of the government has almost never been allowed ; partly for cast protection but mainly pure utilitarianism : often a government has a marginal majority , and losing even a single element would allow to topple it . 
  with bonus criminal immunity if the sentence is disapproved by an internal parliamentary committee :d, 
   on the house and brushed on the edges . 
  that 's the typical jpeg artifact , it shows between every high contrast area in the image . 
  it could also be a well photoshopped image , idc, 
  like so : - they know the ips of the seeders - see you connecting to them - sniff the unencrypted torrent traffic ( isps are bent over backwards , no problem seeing what you see ) - send cease & desist / demand out of court bribe / sue - ? 
   who internship in germany worth nothing this ^  watching five episodes of the series the vampire diaries he deserves it, 
  i 'll be * that * guy : can you post something for verification ? 
  also : does chechnya have some independence or is it bent 90 \u00b0 to moscow ? 
  i do n't dare to link him directly to it , but after the dwarf left office there have been a lot of major crackdowns against organized crime \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  most major cities have a ztl already ( ** z ** ona a ** t ** raffico ** l ** imitato , limited traffic area ) , usually in the city 's historic centre . 
  in those areas only resident 's and commercial vehicles can transit . 
  commercial can only pass in a certain time-frame . 
  i thought this was a somewhat common occurrence in most of europe . 
  this makes sense , our government wants looser economic rules ( read : be allowed to spend more ) . 
  this will mean we will have even more public debt in the long run . 
  but defenders of the government position are saying that being allowed to spend more will generate more investment which will lead to faster growth and consequently lower relative debt . 
  and then there 's us . 
  a ) expect two-three hour queues for most countries , japan/italy/brazil take * at least * four b ) go to r/italy, 
  animal proteins are easier to absorb for the human organism, 
  completely agree , at least here any kind of human food is forbidden to be gmo , period . 
  i counter this by saying that financial bubbles would hurt a lot more if everyone was under the same rule , no matter how many `` levels '' it had . 
  true , the `` commercial '' pizza you find , especially out italy are 3 times thicker and with double the toppings . 
  and by my limited experience the `` anglo saxon '' version of our foods are way fatter ( eg : fat creams like it 's payday ), 
  government issued uv lamps ? 
  also this : we have a lot of cities and towns with surplus but they ca n't spend those money . 
  and go take your mandatory dna test on the second room on the left . 
  we have it mandatory , but if you can say `` the pen is on the table '' you pass it . 
  what is really needed in most of europe is a more rigorous education . 
  so , national socialism ? 
  are you okay with crack cocaine or `` poor man 's '' drug like krokodil ? 
  thinking about it the portuguese way looks like the best one to handle drugs , hmmm, 
  i 'll get on your tail and say that the eu should become the united states of europe . 
  so a state without a vote in the union ?
