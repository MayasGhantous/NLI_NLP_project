  you forgot this ( \u256f \u00b0 \u25a1 \u00b0 \uff09 \u256f ^ ** / s **, 
  even so , they 'll just see you contacting a node , and i hope any civilized country has some form of plausible deniability . 
  that said i agree that if one is worried about privacy the simple presence of a sim in your phone is a security hole . 
  here is where it gets tricky : already established businesses push for less taxes , not bureaucracy alleviation , thus forcing small businesses to ... remain small or get acquired early in their history . 
  i do n't have solid proof for this but i feel that this is the course of the typical small business here . 
  and that is where tor and other meshed network come in help : metadata retention stores only the endpoint of a connection ( eg : your ip and the first tor node ), 
   business in italy , germany , spain or the uk is much more profitable . 
  we might have a more profitable business architecture but sadly there 's a bureaucracy firewall to start a business / enter our market . 
  on the plus side : in recent years taxes on business have been somewhat decreasing and the job market saw some deregulation . 
   le zapping we have the same thing on the third public channel . 
  we call it `` blob '', 
  we too  :d, 
  i went to germany a couple of years ago and payed 3 $ just for turning mobile data on ... 
  i hope this passes . 
  economic migrants are hurting real refugees . 
  i fell pity for people who have a legitimate reason to run away . 
  and yet our government wants to raise the cash payment ceiling from 1000 $ to 3000 $ to `` encourage consumption '' ... yay, 
  could be , but since it was a terrorism investigation many laws are simply bypassed/have faster ... alternatives ^ ^ 1984, 
  i wish , but most covered public parking ban those vehicles here : /, 
  entertainment here is mostly dubbed american shows/movies with some exception . 
  american fashion trends also tend to be copied here by young people . 
  one last thing : italy was death to starbucks !, 
  until recently . 
  now they are about to present themselves as a premium coffee place , not really gathering to the hipster crowd . 
  korea is usa 2.0 and japan is usa 's weird uncle . 
  4chan stores your ip just like 99.9 % of websites , how do you think cp / piracy posters get banned ? 
  county , state , federal . 
  hand all your mayo !, 
   seconded . 
    thirded i think there is a rule against circlerking / s, 
  you also have to hand out all your mayo . 
  you can paste your screenshot directly into imgur and also crop it/paint level editing with imgur tools . 
   the man used the cover of darkness to park his vehicle and escape on foot . 
  title is kinda of misleading . 
  call me paranoid but i do n't regard them highly on a moral level . 
  i do n't think they will reveal every breach they discover . 
  what forbids them to share their discoveries to governments without revealing it to the owner/producer of the broken device ? 
  there is the opt-in option in the beta to use it with html5 . 
  the article said so . 
  relevant `` countermeasures ''  the hack only works if the target has headphones with a built-in microphone plugged in  by using better shielding on their headphone cords , or by making it impossible to use these voice control features without enabling voice recognition or having to say a password , the potential danger could be neutralised . 
  would using an uk tor exit node circumvent this ? 
  it might be too slow tho . 
  so ... east and southern europe are n't european ? 
  [ albania has a 519 years old mosque ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_oldest_mosques_in_the_world#albania ) and [ spain a 1330 ( ! ), 
  years old one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_oldest_mosques_in_the_world#spain ) just look at a southern italian or a spaniard and it 's clear that merchants liked the other european `` merchandise '' . 
  orban 's nothing more then a pig . 
  bar that , pig is f ` in delicious . 
  this is somehow relevant to italy : people here were and still are eager to buy a house and we were massively hit by the financial crisis . 
  well , it 's a mock retrial , nothing official . 
   [ ... ] will involve a real judge in a real court of appeals who will be familiar with the laws of the time -- is an attempt to come to grips with a brutal period in european history and strip it of its folkloric romanticism . 
  this was inspired after  [ ... ] watching a `` terrible '' theatrical re-enactment of toldini 's story a few years ago , which [ ... ] was designed for tourists and deprived the victim of her humanity . 
  still weird tho . 
  what 's the purpose of that underbarrel tube ? 
  they created a buffer zone where there are close to zero buildings and vegetation , they will see you before you see them . 
   they do n't want to retaliate the death of their accomplice . 
  they wo n't if they are unarmed and the guards showed that they will kill if attacked . 
  it would be nice to have a french version of eataly . 
  this can continue via pm if you want to tell me your opinion without the fear of a ban , got no problem to talk about it openly . 
  i think you confused rape with sex , a victim of homicide is not a willing party . 
  edit : made myself clearer, 
  a person ca n't hide symptoms of an illness , keep an eye on them while they are in processing facilities , maybe even test them if there 's a worry about disease . 
  hm , you might be right . 
   as already raised more money ( $ 41 mil ) than ron paul did in 2012 ( $ 40 mil ) . 
  you have to take inflation in account : this makes ron paul ( $ 41.5 mil ) vs sanders ( $ 41 mil ) in 2015 us dollars . 
  as of now ron paul still got more real $, 
  the typical health worker is already trained better to treat female rape , and rape with female victims has less of a social stigma then men 's . 
  having a center with male rape specialization is needed a lot more then it is for female 's . 
   a specialization that was just as needed as it was for women , and which was sadly absent . 
  pretty much any already existent rape treatment center is already for woman as of now . 
  / u/alexrng has already made a [ good point about this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3oufjn/sweden_opens_worlds_first_male_rape_centre_a/#cw0ofb0 ) in this same thread . 
   about 75 % of cases were among people born in countries where tb is more common , mostly south asia ( 60 % of cases ) and sub-saharan africa ( 22 % ) . 
  migration is a major factor , but london 's healthcare seems to work quite well , tb seems to infect few uk `` natives '' , this means that the disease is readily identified and treated . 
  -- by only using data from that news-piece we can say that the infection rate for uk natives in london is 25 % of 42/100000 = 10.5 / 100000 to give an idea copenhagen 's , [ which has a 22.7 % not danish population ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/copenhagen#demographics_and_society ) , [ compared to london 's 44 % ] ( http://qz.com/337508/london-has-more-people-than-ever-and-44-are-ethnic-minorities/ ) , has an higher absolute infection rate . 
   [ ... ] copenhagen at 17 . 
  feel free to correct me , but i can say with some confidence that london 's healthcare may even work better then even the best case scenario in the bbc article . 
  edit : added sources, 
  you have a point . 
  imo refugee centers/hotspots are essentially a prison , if the processing facilities have decently trained staff outbreaks can be controlled just like a prison does . 
   asylum seeker in iceland - 2015 as sexual partners both of them share the responsibility to use protection . 
   asylum seeker in the britain - 2006 same as before  asylum seeker in poland - 2008 this one was a legit cokoo 3 in 7 years is n't a relevant pool for anything , bring at least some dozen that are chosen to be representative of the whole asylum seeker population and then we can have a reasonable debate . 
  it 's not our fault , they * are * jew after all ^ ^ ** / s **, 
  eh , when you 're talking about economic movements between the two wealthiest `` countries '' a 1 % difference means 10s if not 100s billions euros . 
   the eu leaders will also discuss so-called `` hotspots '' -- controversial reception centres [ ... ] controversial ? 
  people need to have documents , and refugees/migrants have none . 
  hotspots are essential if we want some order in this mess . 
  as long as you do n't jump naked in their tents and start having unprotected sex with them i highly doubt an epidemic will start . 
  found the french . 
  eh , it will all be china in a few decades :p, 
  there 's this kebab joint in front of my home that makes some cheap but fucking delicious pizza topped with kebab ... 
  i want some now . 
  being christian is n't a problem , it may even help integration . 
  protests/dissent appear mainly when there 's a surge of immigrants in a specific area or if for any reason a significant part of the crime-committing population can be identified in a minority . 
  you could catch those wolves and release them here to cull our boars . 
   hunting is banned , but limited , targeted culls are allowed . 
  key phrase right there . 
  two votes by the same body is just redundant . 
  no one knows about the ttip in italy , and every major party welcomes it with open arms and no discussion :(, 
  time to go shop for some mayo ^ ^ ^ / s, 
   the reform will have to ** return to the senate ** for another vote next year and will also have to ** pass twice through the lower house ** , giving its opponents ample opportunity to ambush the package . 
   it will then be put to a ** referendum ** , adding a further awkward hurdle to its eventual ratification .
