  i love the simplicity of our law-making system . 
   in recent years [ ... ] around a hundred packages [ ... ] accurate . 
  let some time pass then push the law again , does n't politics work this way ? 
  uk , just learn from your child : usa . 
  require software companies to create backdoors in your product . 
  they have an [ english youtube channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/yellowsaffron ) , 
  i read between the lines that you want refugees to remain in the first eu country they land on . 
  either the eu injects massive amount of funds into italy , greece and the likes ( enough to create new jobs in struggling economies ) or those people have to be redistributed . 
  wanting only the positive part of european membership is hypocritical . 
   why did he try so hard to come to germany ? 
  he was safe in turkey . 
  he was also safe in greece . 
  because refugees in turkey ca n't legally work , afaik . 
  and greece has probably the worst job market in the whole eu . 
  my bad , i 'm using ublock origin as a firefox mobile add-on ; the app adaway for a custom hosts file ( i use their default lists and added the ones i have on the pc ) . 
  the latter requires root . 
  oh well , that sucks . 
  is it literally eviction or just higher priority for public housing ? 
  that 's what i use on my phone . 
  i 'm using abp on my 16gb ram pc because how well it handles customized element block , and non intrusive ads can be blocked by simply checking an option . 
  fair enough , but as of now with adblock plus enabled i can still browse the site . 
  is it possible to convert some old east germany buildings to refugee centers ? 
  here some old cold war era buildings are being converted for this . 
  take care of them, 
  from an outsider pov rajoy seems doomed to lose these elections no matter what he does . 
  just prepared kimchi with the ingredients i could find here . 
  something tells me that the next metro will have very accurate ragdolls for black people . 
  i would n't take advice about meter accuracy from a german , at least for a while . ^ ^ ^ :d, 
   bank buses love it, 
  now you can tho . 
  [ the date for complete phase out has not been reached yet tho . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phase-out_of_incandescent_light_bulbs#european_union )  the eu has given the target of 2016 to phase out halogen bulbs , and any bulb available for purchase after the 2016 date must have at least a ` b ' energy rating . 
  led lamps are way more efficient then incandescent . 
  if one does n't purposely abuses them they are more cost and power effective . 
  a note : while we use non-incandescent bulbs we are also using more and more electrical stuff ( stoves , domotics etc. ), 
  so consumption is rising , albeit at a slower rate due to obliging the market to offer more efficient products . 
  on italy 's side immigrants coming by boat in 2015 are a similar number to 2014 , they have already understood that the balkan route is better . 
  and still : for few thousands dead hundred of thousands pass . 
  so the odds are still largely in their favor . 
  mare nostrum takes immigrants in tho . 
  losing a boat becomes an operation cost for traffickers . 
  ** italy ** * [ rome 's mayor ignazio marino resigns under pressure . 
  ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/romes-mayor-ignazio-marino-resigns-under-pressure-1444335106 ) personal note : * imo * a main cause of this was being unfortunately in charge when a pandora 's box of corruption that touched the previous city council was opened . 
  * [ singer anna tatangelo posed nude for a cancer awareness campaign , gets backslash ( it link ) ] ( http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cronaca/2015/10/04/anna-tatangelo-nuda-contro-il-tumore-al-seno-e-bufera-sulla-campagna-lilt_b9a1f31b-f0f8-4423-b347-61da2c9c934f.html ) this started from a sjw group of cancer patients on facebook , then became quite big on social media . 
  nothing much italy-related happened . 
  i do n't know really , guess i had a brain fart . 
  off the top of my head i 'd say [ m2o ] ( http://www.m2o.it/m2o/player ) , electronic music and not too much ads . 
  then there 's [ virgin radio ] ( http://www.virginradio.it/sezioni/1184/virgin-radio-on-air ) which sadly it 's the only rock radio with national coverage and has too many ads for my taste . 
  lately i 've just been using spotify/tunein and netease , a free chinese equivalent to spotify ( ported to english by some good soul ) . 
  that 's because people have to be at those locations , you can still take out a packet on the sidewalk regardless of its appearance . 
  shock effect is only temporary , in the worst case we 'll have to wait until the next generation of smokers to see a rise in smoker population . 
  eh , italy and strategic thinking do n't really go together . 
  and at most what comes out from that hypothetical round table will be a common ground on policies that will still need to pass trough various committee and the eu parliament . 
  we 're talking about reshaping the concept of europe , everyone will have a say on that . 
  also : feel free to correct me if i 'm wrong , but i think spain was never too involved in eu policies so this somewhat weighs down on the chance of a seat on that hypothetical table . 
  mostly nonsense with veiled social criticism here and there . 
  i get why people like him but for me most of our music , '70s included , is just too simple on the instrumentals and monotone on the voice part . 
   rino gaetano i kinda hate his genre , so i ca n't really help you there ; i 'm pretty sure that / r/italy will . 
  imho he 's saying that he wants the wealthiest countries to get together and decide what course of action to follow . 
  he 's quite the diplomat after all . 
  italy can into mild intolerance . 
  that 's what meshed networks are for  : p2p chat without the need of a preexisting infrastructure is becoming more and more common for mass gatherings of people . 
  this forces the use of jammers on the field , which is way less practical then ordering a couple of companies to shut off . 
  translation of the cited news-piece -- . 
  -- ** italy calls founding countries to build a two-tiered europe ** no decisions about tornados in iraq . 
  wishes for an end to sanctions to moscow in syria ( ? ), 
  `` i 'm not going to hide that i 'm more focused on libya then syria . 
  there has been no decision about bombing iraq . 
  nonetheless without the parliament approval '' . 
  [ editorial self promotion ] middle east , russia , and europe too . 
  `` i 've sent a letter to my colleagues working in the other 5 founding members ( germany , france , belgium , netherlands and luxembourg ) . 
  we suggest to push for a more homogeneous eu integration . 
  the first reactions were positive so i think that we 'll have a 6-way encounter in rome in a few months . 
  -- ** isis progress ** gentiloni insists on the mediation role that italy could have in an `` extremely difficult '' situation . 
  iraq , syria , lebanon are in the same emergency , the migrants ' humanitarian catastrophe . 
  the minister of interiors talks about the four tornados stationed in iraq . 
  `` we support al-abadi efforts and are already part of the anti-isis `` small group '' ( the 21 members in the 63 members coalition ) . 
  it 's clear that iraq wants to take back the al anbar region , then take back mosul from isis , there is a need for more efforts '' . 
  -- ** from bagdad to damascus ** `` since the start of this crisis italy is on the line `` assad change , not regime change '' , bombing him away wo n't work . 
  we think that the only feasible solution is getting rid of assad without creating fertile ground for is . '' getting rid of assad will be difficult , and russia 's intervention in syria has certainly created a potentially catastrophic variable , and , according to some observers , the possibility of a worldwide conflict [ [ [ [ editorial hyperbole here imho ] ] ] ] . 
  for the first 7-8 days russia 's intervention was seen as positive even by the us , but the overstep into turkish territory and the lack of coordination with other countries russia may cause an escalation the situation . 
  because of this i insist on a transitory process , that even the syrian representative at onu has asked '' . 
  -- ** russia means ukraine too ** january is the date when russia sanction would have to be renewed or cancelled , but there is time until at leas the year 's end . 
  if russia does n't respect mink 's agreement ( editor 's note : including giving back annexed territories ) . 
  italy is not a major player of the syrian matter , and hardly will be in the next months . 
  `` we are more worried about libya then syria '' . 
  pm renzi wants italy to have a guiding role in the libyan situation . 
  gentiloni follows the negotiation headed by bernardino le\u00f3n , in skhirat , in morocco . 
  `` i was there , there are still major points of disagreement but there is hope for a coalition government in lybia '' . 
  there is the flowing idea of an anti-human traders operation in libya toghether with our allies . 
  this does n't mean sending thousands of troops in the libyan desert . 
  it 's worth noting that the iran agreement helped stabilize the regional powers even in libya . 
  -- ** the union in two concentric circles ** the conflicts ' sufferings have come into europe with the refugee faces . 
  gentiloni is satisfied by merkel 's desire to push past dublin 's agreement . 
  we now have 3 main goals : - permanent volunteer quotas for redistribution of people recognized as refugees in the 28 member states . 
  - common policies for asylum seekers - common policies for returning people not recognized as refugees we need a more integrated europe , that we will also need a new pact with the uk , but wo n't refuse to push forward [ [ [ the meaning of this is n't clear even in italian ] ] ] . 
  i 've grown with the impression of a two-speed europe , but maybe what we need now is an europe in two concentric circles . 
  the monetary agreement and the integration on different fronts , even the military one . 
  what italy wants is to start again from the six founding members . '', 
  duh , jets ^ ( [ insert dank meme ] ) burn tons of fuel .
