  tbh i would expect a lot of people rallying in a quasi-dictatorship nation to have at least a tor web browser and firechat .

  there 's the eu equivalent being discussed now , tpp is trans - ** pacific **, 
  buy in bulk ? 
  man in his early twenties here . 
  thanks to the disastrous economic state of greece and in minor part to triton ( which is still laughably underfunded and of reduced scope ) the influx for 2014 and 2015 are similar , but maybe this is just because the mediterranean route has reached its max capacity . 
  floods of illegal migrants , especially in the summer , have been common even before the arab spring and the volume of it increasing consistently for the past two decades . 
  since the early nineties we had a pretty xenophobic 3rd party , lega nord , but with the declining influence of its historic leader umberto bossi and its successor matteo salvini wanting to broaden the party 's appeal the racist stance has been pushed less . 
  sadly this is being way offset by the discontent caused by the mix of the immigration surge and the 2007 crisis . 
  in the everyday lives italians and migrants mind their own business , but there has always been a slight intolerance to immigration in this country . 
  what has really changed is the increase of `` poor wars '' , disadvantaged italians clashes with minorities . 
  one of their arguments , which well ... it 's true , is that refugee subsidies more often then not are significantly higher than a low qualified job salary . 
  edit : added a '' . '', 
  just another campaign that works only on the ones that already share the idea represented in the ad . 
  compassion is not going to work on terrorists or would-be . 
  do you guys have decent news agencies ? 
  here we are at least as bad as you but agencies are somewhat neutral . 
  docking * is * a thing . 
  but that 's another can of worms . 
  fyi i reported the yt video , that 's against their rules ( animal cruelty ) . 
  * something something * black hole . 
   but directive still needs euro parl approval - get the popcorn, 
  there most likely are , just like there are professional beggars . 
  some people simply have chosen it as a lifestyle . 
  glasgow is the circle were satan 's feet are . 
  well , at least she seems to have recovered : /, 
  first went the wine , now it 's the time of cheese . 
  take that france !, 
  i 've been using big g and bing lately ( bing is better for `` research '' and surprisingly msoft 's translator works better for non latin languages ) . 
  i was just about to switch to duckduckgo but i guess i could try this one too , 
  hmmm , let 's see . 
  not really listening to eu stuff lately but here 's some nice ones : 1967 , italian singer-songwriter : [ fabrizio de andr\u00e8 - bocca di rosa ] ( https://open.spotify.com/track/2q6shhziqbkmg9ab8qfwri ) ( [ youtube link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib7lsjkzvvc ) ) literally `` rose mouth '' . 
  it 's the story of a young promiscuous young woman in 1960s rural norther italy . 
  she got publicly shamed and expelled from her town only to be welcomed by a procession in the next one , and even asked to stand by the priest 's side . 
  2015 , laxative pop : also : [ baby k - roma - bangkok ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcpq6_f-xfo ) , a decent summer song . 
  2015 , finnish folk metal : [ koorpiklani - sahti ] ( https://open.spotify.com/track/6wor2njg9f0n6qjczmhr58 ) . 
  their last album made for great treks last summer . 
  you can ask google to blur your house from their satellite view and i think from street view too if this kind of privacy really matters to you . 
  few people have done it . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/5/50/asti-stemma.png ) appearance : silver cross inside red shield with a golden coronet above and two palm leaves with red lace . 
  the city 's motto * aste nitet mundo sancto custode secundo * ( asti shines in the world thanks to its saint protector secondo ) is put between the leaves and the shield . 
  date of adoption : later 1200s , ( certainly after the crusades and before the end of the century ) . 
  reason of adoption : asti 's participated in the crusades in the years 1202 and 1209 . 
  the shield and cross were inspired by a military order that participated in the crusades , the knight hospitallers ( official name `` order of the knights of saint john '' . 
  also known as order of saint john , order of hospitallers ) . 
  the motto was first used in 1275 . 
  one last thing : asti province 's [ coat of arms ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/6/6a/provincia_di_asti-stemma.png ) is a fancier looking version of the city one . 
  i 'd like to add an honorable mention to italy 's forza nuova : historically a fascist apologist party , but in recent years they started to use a mo reminiscing the alt-right current . 
  heil , if you switch ib with forza nuova that could pretty much be a sensible description of them . 
  - mildly against - on the bright side john oliver will have material for at least 4 years - ethnic cleansing - the selfish side of me would like italy to have closer ties with russia , they are an important trade partner after all . 
  yet the rational part can not ignore the threat to ee and general hostility towards western moderate politicians . 
  honestly surprised to have made the cut . 
  with the risk of shooting myself in the foot i 'll vouch for / u/marktplatz too . 
  the guy has his ideas but overall seems to be a sensible guy . 
  1 ) learn to speak italian 2 ) be able to hold a conversation with libyans , somali * and * ** eritreans ** ( ! ), 
  75 years or older . 
  3 ) ... 4 ) failure, 
  might be on a local level , not used nationally at all . 
  the plural would be renz * e * ( * ren * as in render and * ze * as in `` tse-tse '' ) anyway . 
  the second syllable is rarely found in english , sorry for poor example . 
  to answer the first part : i do agree with you on that part . 
  it is reasonably unarguable that the statement `` we 're slow at making laws '' is false . 
  it 's because having a government come to its natural end is rare that structural reforms hardly if ever get through . 
  most of what you named were simply cost cutting measures . 
  also , having weak governments forces to have watered down solution to appease the myriad of political currents and opposition parties . 
  with all due respect , if in 70 years the current and past systems did n't allow for a stability in governance there is a need for a more heavy handed solution . 
  like law throughput could be used a sensible parameter to qualify a country efficiency at governing itself at all . 
  what this country needs is a more centralized system of governance and a way to keep a government in power for more than the 2 something average we have . 
  for the french it is . 
  luckily the alps separates them from us . 
   no idea why people are downvoting you ( and me ) . 
  this has been x-posted on r/italy , which is pretty much on the opposite side of this sub 's political spectrum . 
  just try to ignore the votes and continue with your polite discussion if you can . 
  or the back entrance if you 're in genoa . 
  how can iceland have such an extremely low unemployment ? 
  do they something like `` overhiring '' in the mining and fishing industry ? 
  i 'll go bottom top : the financial times --  il sole 24 ore , respectable financial newspaper . 
  the sun --  the closest you can get are il giornale ( old school right ) & il fatto quotidiano ( a mix of liberist-ish and straight populism ) , plus a myriad of gossip only 1 $ magazines . 
  the guardian --  la repubblica , demochristian the independent --  libero , an intellectual wannabe version of il giornale the times --  corriere della sera , as close as the italian version as the times you can get . 
  for the first two there are n't really similar papers ( with high sales numbers ) , italy is generally not as politically conservative as the uk . 
  you also have to generally take down the gossip frenzy tone of your papers and switch it with `` chronicle '' : regular crimes often get extensive coverage in all of our news media , we especially like dead people . 
  ignore that , i bombed a joke about 6 pack and garbage food . 
  [ not with that ] ( https://i.imgur.com/yd4qfzn.jpg ), 
  appreciate it . 
  yes , here 's a bit of context : the situation can be summarized as : 1 ) the current system would almost certainly guarantee a win for m5s populists , but even they have to act as being against it because 2 ) the referendum win and the current electoral law are two important selling point for the government , so every opposition party squishes them together to present a single evil . 
  why do we have such a. . . strange electoral law ? 
  because the government has a thin majority and had to compromise to let it be approved by the parliament . 
  a lot of cards are still in the deck . 
  before the national elections we will have a confirmative constitutional referendum ^ 1 and there are talks about modifying the electoral law . 
  if and how those two pass the government coalition will be either be strengthened or seriously weakened , with even a chance for ~ ~ anticipated ~ ~ early elections . 
  -- ultra ** tl ; dr ** 1 : senate will be downsized both in size and legislative power , becoming mostly a chamber focused on the various regional matters , the executive will be somewhat reinforced . 
  the whole political apparatus will also be somewhat more centralized . 
  we had [ virgilio ] ( https://i.imgur.com/02ur6kc.png ) . 
  it 's still active , but it used google since the early '10 and bing since this summer . 
  in all of our hearts . 
  durgh , you 're right . 
  what about the top website with local tld ? 
  ( italy -  * . it , uk -  * . co.uk , etc. ), 
  interesting , here ristorante is one of the best frozen pizzas ( imo ) . 
  seeing an obese man dressed in rags would be way more terrifying than a dope master chief cosplay .
