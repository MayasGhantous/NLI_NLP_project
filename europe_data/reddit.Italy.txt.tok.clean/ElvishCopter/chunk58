  i really like these easily consumable history post . 
  the channel also has more content with this same style . 
  thanks for making me discover this op , 
  thanks for sharing your point of view . 
  seems we have opposite views on that . 
  i do think that having reasonable people with opposing point of views would balance the moderation . 
  think of it like vote counting commissions , they are made as heterogeneous as possible to force neutrality . 
  pretty sure most of that is from shitposting , i rarely if ever gave elaborate answers , especially in this sub . 
  looking at this thread shows that there are way better candidates now . 
  i doubt that mods ever considered picking me lol . 
  ** translated description follows ** shakemovie : animation of seismic wave propagation on earth 's surface caused by mw 6.5 earthquake at 07:40 30-oct-2016 in central italy . 
  -- animation is necessarily preliminary since more detailed data on the breaking process , essential to have a more accurate simulation of wave propagation , will become available in the next few day . 
  -- blue coloured wave represent a fast downward movement , red ones an upward movement . 
  every second in the animation represents 1 real time second . 
  the first 2 minutes since the seismic event start are shown . 
  this is not an artist 's rendition , but come from computed equation on propagation process data . 
  velocity and amplitude of the waves depend from the seismic source , terrain composition and topography . 
  these waves do not propagate in a uniform way in space and locations at same distance are influenced in completely different manner . 
  waves propagate more towards adriatic regions and lazio . 
  ________________________________________________________ animation was generated as follows : 1 ) seismic waves are registered from ingv agency 's national seismic network of seismographs and are analyzed to determine the fundamental parameters of the earthquake ( eg . 
  : epicentre , origin time , magnitude ) . 
  for earthquakes of 3.5 or above magnitude the moment tensor , a mathematical description of forces acting on the originating fault , is also calculated . 
  2 ) a tridimensional model of the interested region is built including geographical complexities like moho and soft terrains ( like alluvial sediments in the po valley and some apennine basins ) . 
  3 ) using the 3d model and the moment tensor the wave propagation is simulated . 
  it takes in account the local seismic reduction caused by alluvial basins ( soft terrains ) and speed increase in harder rocky terrains . 
  equation are solved with specfem3d software ( peter et al. 
  2012 , www.geodynamics.org ) , with ingv contribution . 
  4 ) seismograms and speed value evolution of terrain at surface level are saved and visualized via paraview ( www.paraview.org ) this kind of simulation has been possible only in recent times , since parallel calculation from supercomputing have become available . 
  for this relatively small simulation 512 processors have been used , for a total of 5000 minutes of calculations and 256 gib of memory . 
  difference analysis form seismographs produce from these simulations and ones from real measures offer crucial informations not only for determination of the seismic origin and underground characteristics , but also for shake forecast from hypothetical seismic events . 
  technical detail : to reduce elaboration times and having limited knowledge of underground details at the moment this animation is at a relatively `` low frequency '' , waves up to 0.25 hz are shown . 
  this means that the wave front `` sees '' objects of size 2/4 km . 
  the local seismic response is limited to geological structures of such sizes . 
  increasing the frequency content would cause smaller details to be shown and , as an example , would consider amplification from sediments . 
  *** update *** isis stole the * s * from glas ( s ) to reach extraplanetary terrorism threat level . 
  new branch to be known as issis . 
  inshalli-fi , brother . 
  op , there 's * a * thing you might be missing . 
  eh , whatever . 
  no one 's going to die if i send this application . 
  question | answer -- | -- where are you from ? 
  | italy what languages can you speak fluently ? 
  | italian , english what is your usual timezone ? 
  | cet have you had previous experience as a mod inside or outside of reddit ? 
  | moderated a web mmorpg forum a few years back , currently helping the moderation of a regional sub . 
  what do you like the most about / r/europe ? 
  | subreddit `` franca '' where people with different national identities openly and ( mostly ) civilly discuss and promote them . 
  i learned more about european culture and lifestyle here than i would have otherwise have without this sub . 
  especially about the smaller baltic and balkan states . 
  do you believe in working as a team or mostly working alone ? 
  | both , enforcing clear rules ( eg . 
  delete content & ban obvious spam accounts ) should require no consultation with the team . 
  behind the scene changes which will affect the whole user base should be discussed broadly ( eg . 
  easter eggs ) . 
  for team communication i despise reddit 's own systems and hugely prefer live chat tools ( especially slack ) . 
  in general , how would you evaluate / r/europe 's rules ? 
  | rules are rules . 
  what 's important is that the subreddit does n't promote a particular political agenda ( besides being somewhat primarily pro european level collaboration , but this is due to the users , not the rules ) . 
  what change would you make in / r/europe if you could ? 
  | 90 % fine with the sub . 
  maybe having a moderation team with an as varied as possible geographical diversity , to have at least 1 mod with a short response time at any hour . 
  why do you want to join / r/europe 's mod team ? 
  | i would like to keep the place tidy and have too much free time . 
  disclosure : the regional sub would still take priority over this one . 
  do you think politically neutral moderation is achievable and/or desirable ? 
  | neutrality is paramount , there are agenda oriented european subs already . 
  a moderation team with people that hold different but not extreme views ( race supremacists , anarchists , etc ) would be the best realistic shield against subconscious and/or intentional bias . 
  now they say ~ ~ 6.1 ~ ~ 6.6, 
  be more creative with your baits . 
  finally found the will to clean up a cellar/grotto room used for storage . 
  because they want to listen to their hometown 's radio broadcast , and you need a really long antenna for that . 
  shameless x-post of oc from / u/paddy32, 
  sweden , france and the uk have fertility rates near or above 2.0 , and they face this problem too . 
  in virtually every house down here in the boots the water goes : drinkable water ( taps , showers , ... ) -- biomass filter ( magic , idk details ) --  grey waters ( radiators , garden outlet , ... ) --  sewers, 
  last poll say 31 % favourable . 
  low , but he 's still the most liked party leader . 
  as far as i know no other alternative displacement nor repatriation process has been put in place , so those people will just continue to roam around the calais area . 
  not this again ... 
  and here 's your payment : https://i.imgur.com/cpqmxqh.png, 
  i 'll give you 10.01 $ drawn in paint if you let me win this . 
  1000 nz$ are 660 $ at today 's exchange rate . 
  silly dane , alps are mountains . 
  think lego towers , just bigger and rockier . 
  1000 nz dollars are `` just '' 660 $ . 
  nz is in buttfuck nowhere , so anything imported costs quite a lot . 
  it 's not a main target of islamic terrorism , and in 2009 isis was n't yet anything to be bothered about . 
  it did n't turn a profit the second it ended , never mind the infrastructures that actually got built . 
  security reasons , probably . 
  the explosion looks like a lot like other blown up furnaces . 
  that flaming car will be perfect for my popcorn . 
  because this is a totally realistic scenario and not a push from a nationalist . 
  love word clouds , but this one is really hard on the eyes . 
  racist secessionist , ex neo fascist , land developer and media mogul become politician to shape laws at his favour . 
  take your pick . 
  and rain is damp . 
  mayble lead by example instead of blurting obvious phrases over and over . 
  crap personnel organization from the train company is the problem here . 
  the drivers themselves are obliged to rest , and sanctions are hard on all the parties involved . 
  it 's the only way that rules against exploitation can be enforced . 
  eh , they 're salty enough .
