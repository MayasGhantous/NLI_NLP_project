  no need to import more of it . 
  if it works anything like it does in italy they 'll be quite happy . 
  lifetime annuity is pretty nice . 
  what else but the anschluss ? 
  i did n't think people would misinterpret them as legit result . 
  now i can see how alphabet makes money . 
  it stalled . 
  the parliament went on vacation from late july up to the past week . 
  the debate should resume ... any time now . 
  nah , it 's just that we can not accept to decriminalize drugs , so every now and then some other minor crime gets depenalized . 
  rinse and repeat . 
  of which greece chose the express install , and got stuck with migration 2016 adware . 
  with all the migrant stuff happening i 'm happy we do n't have the dodecanese anymore . 
  ** italy ** - a football stadium expansion over a 2500 years old archeological site has been approved in the city of crotone . 
  the city population is mainly in favour of this expansion , the archaeological community not so much . 
  - a [ piper plane ] ( http://static.robbreport.com/sites/default/files/images/articles/2015may/1405491//5_piper-aircraft-m500.jpg ) departed from treviso crashed in macedonia . 
  the cause was a combination of bad weather , lack of high octane fuel in an intermediate airport and suspect maintenance . 
  - jerking off in public ( technically any obscene act ) not a crime anymore , the punishment will be a 5 ' 000-20 ' 000 $ fine . 
  this is the result of the first verdict about the crime after a packet of measures to lighten the stress on the italian overburdened prison situation the past november . 
  til most of eastern europe has priapism . 
  spoken/informal italian frequently omits subjects , especially pronouns . ^ 1 in this situation you would ask * perch\u00e8 gli inglesi ... * ^ 2 , even if the correct adjective would be * britannici * , but the former is already somewhat formal . 
  case in point google autocompletes with a question about geology , not population . 
  1 : ie : * ~ ~ io ~ ~ mi sento bene * [ i feel good ] . 
  2 : italian does n't have a neutral gender , so we use masculine if the group has at least 1 male member . 
  same quality for the italian results . 
  they had to use * perch\u00e8 le persone inglesi * ( why are british people ) to have that output . 
  too bad that 's a seldomly used phrase at best . 
  more common variants ask about their lack of $ adoption , brexit , or driving direction . 
   ( anything with storage , phones , pcs , flash drives , hard drives , cd/dvds , etc. ), 
  making any piece of tech more expensive and giving even more reasons to buy them in spain . 
  same thing here , but we usually use german stores . 
  i 've never thought to try spain . 
  edit : amazon prices are mostly the same , i 'll stick to germany . 
  a barking dog never bites . 
  bark ukip & the gang , bark . 
  they had to use * perch\u00e8 le persone inglesi * ( * why are british people * ) to have that output . 
  too bad that 's a seldomly used phrase at best . 
  more common variants ask about their lack of $ adoption , brexit , or driving direction . 
  there 's no reason to live if we 're second even by country with fewer suicides . 
  is it just dns stuff or something more advanced ? 
  grexit now !, 
  plus not a lot of those apartments are inhabited , they 're bought as an investment and rarely if ever have human presence in them . 
  iirc in a documentary they showed that the concrete tanks are coated in vynil . 
  it 's pretty much a fact that areas with large amount of non east asian minorities have higher crime rates , mainly because they 're also lower income areas thus prone be shadier . 
  it 's not the end of the world , but as a tourist you 're better off avoiding them . 
  and taiwan \\ # 1 , but the nine dash line is the best line . 
  i 'm surprised to see that there is no obstacle nor ditch to separate the two direction of traffic , especially since it 's a 14 lane road in a city . 
  yup , but it 's a different wording . 
  what 's pc in the us changes every season ... 
  in the us that 's 10x more offensive than saying black , seeing as `` coloured '' was used during segregation times . 
   anti-terrorist zombie commie tanks ? 
  lol, 
  you are essentially proposing to make loitering a crime ... 
  ha , the only proof would be oral from parties with a conflict of interest ( employer and fired employee ) . 
  if a blank paper is signed and compiled immediately after no forensic tool will be able to prove the fraud . 
  whataboutism at his finest , nice . 
  [ reverse searching the image is even more what . 
  i really liked my lumia 610 , too bad windows store is ... barren , and at the time i could n't even change dns , or keep the phone off to recharge faster . 
  there 's a gang of cheery fellas that 's good at lighting ~ ~ people ~ ~ up . 
  that 's just a survival technique . 
  the two options on the voting paper . 
  i 've extended my answer . 
  tl ; dr constitutional , no quorum . 
  yes : one main parliementary chamber , the other relegated to regional matters . 
  more centralized power . 
  no from almost all opposing parties and a few gvmnt `` defectors '' . 
  most likely to cause vote of no confidence . 
  the saddest part is that the discussion is mainly on `` vote yes because we 're good '' / `` no to put down the governmnent '' . 
  partly because the reform is quite complicated , and also because the political debate here is 90 % on the person , not the matter . 
  czech this out !, 
  [ 7 ] * 10 ^ 1 m/s to be scientifically precise . 
  - charlie hebdo tickled lots of italians with [ this vignette ] ( https://i.imgur.com/eiwzvba.jpg ) , and put salt on the wound with [ this second one ] ( https://i.imgur.com/k7jdmj1.png ) - rome saw the resignation/firing of 5 important figures this week : the city `` treasurer '' , the cabinet head ( a sort of vice mayor ) , 2 heads of public transport and 1 of public waste resigned . 
  mayor raggi refused to attend a city council hearing to explain her plan for the future . 
  - the ministry of public health campaign for a `` fertility day '' , which encouraged families to procreate , was awfully received by the public . 
  the main counterargument being lack of financial stability and accessibility to public daycare . 
  - italy 's economy growth in the second quarter was stagnant - it 's hot again weekly referendum poll : yes 49 % | no 51 %, 
  there 's an higher focus on roman , than medieval up to xix century history , so in most cases the xx is really shrinked in a few lessons . 
  wwii is mainly taught as ally vs axis and japan is ignored but the two nukings , major events ( germany attacks poland , london battle , winter war , invasion of italy , ww2 over ) with a major focus on minor italian events ( on the ww2 scale ) and a de facto glorification of partisan militias and local uprisings . 
  thanks to the latter italians do n't feel any `` guilt '' like german , or even austrians , do . 
  well , market garden was essentially that . 
  pfft , that was just rightful retaliation towards that radio tower massacre . 
  we gotchu , germany bros. 
  people already guessed correctly , but that building style is typical of italy and the plants further narrow it down to the nation 's centre . 
  the palm + pine combo especially . 
   1 $ aka monachese cent . 
  first : the title is as clickbait as it gets , please at least read the content . 
  he 's criticising the social norm where people that do n't go drinking with coworkers after clocking out are deemed less worthy . 
  i agree with him , gulping down booze after clocking out is not a factor that matters in your work efficency . 
  team building my ass , we 're in the 21st century , there are better ways to have a solid team . 
  you 've been the most effective obvious troll i 've seen in a while , lol . 
  eh , if they get a pass for drawing mohammed they get a pass for a much lighthearted joke . 
  and maybe they 've been too good at it . 
  eh , too many irish rish rishes for my taste . 
  some of you belgradian are alright , do n't go working tomorrow . 
  it could be better , the nation too . 
  i think they simply paraphrased `` transalpine '' , which is commonly used as a demonym for `` french people '' in italian . 
  the outrage is caused by the condescendence of those messages , families do n't avoid having children because they ... have their priorities wrong , but because it 's a titanic economic and time consuming effort that for many is just impossible to afford . 
  a short term contraction of a financial index is n't really useful to predict the future , especially in a situation where the real life cause of this anxiety does n't even have a fixed date . 
  there 's just not enough information to know if this situation is positive or negative , unless you 're playing into high risk finance . 
  linking all these up and downs to brexit is pretty pointless , article 50 has yet to be triggered .
