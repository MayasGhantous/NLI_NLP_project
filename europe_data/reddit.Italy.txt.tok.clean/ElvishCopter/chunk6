  weird cousin with the lisp , how you been ? 
  * high five spain *, 
  someone should definitely polandball-ize this chain . 
  [ here ] ( http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/10/8/084008/article ) is the link to the cited research , it 's highly technical . 
  the ones with the best price/quality ratio . 
  there are also quite some people that only go for `` bio '' food . 
  i wish this was possible in italy too , no food from out of the canteen kitchen can come inside the facility , at least in public schools ones . 
  * \u00d6sterreich to the ostrichs , stop the oppression !, 
  * * austria is australian !, 
  it 's just those two cities , for some reason it seems all the bad drivers live there . 
  if you want do drive safely here and are not in a hurry try to stay behind a truck with a non italian license plate , they drive much more carefully then the average . 
  want to live your life ? 
  tailgate an over-packed family car , which of course has tires way too flat and the driver thinks the road is a giant pinball machine . 
  nothing , it 's just the first time i see so many different hu users together in r/europe . 
  - the english version of ansa ( [ rss feed here ] ( http://www.ansa.it/english/english_rss.xml ) ) , the main italian news agency . 
  - there is also another agancy , agi , but i do n't see an rss feed for their english version ( website is http://www.agi.it/en if you 're interested ) . 
  i 'm reluctant on recommending you any digital newspaper or tv news website , they are heavily politicized . 
  agencies are more neutral . 
  [ the wiki ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/news_sources ) als has a pretty good list of europe news sources in english . 
  lots of hungarians in this comment chain . 
  i do n't stand by that , but there is an old saying that goes : * donna al volante pericolo costante * ( literally `` woman at the steering wheel , constant danger '' ) . 
  we are pretty much the koreans of europe regarding traffic . 
  come to naples or rome , you wo n't get homesick :d, 
  `` mercato '' is pretty common in italy , most medium-large cities have a day of the week when this happens . 
  that 's ... sad, 
   it 's 1200 something  be king of a piece of land  sleeping in my straw bed under sheet from a sheep i killed yesterday because it ate all my potatoes or something  have pulmonary infection because who does n't , it 's the middle ages  sneeze two giant blood cloths on my new sheet mfw i created the latvian flag .

  you 're wrong on two ingredients . 
  try again , with more traditional ones , 
  [ yup ] ( https://conceptdraw.com/a1129c3/p1/preview/640/pict--political-map-european-union-eu-28:-candidate-countries-map ), 
  but jokes aside , teen pregnancy is really low here , we have the opposite problem : later and later pregnancies , due to financial insecurity , which can be worse for the newborn . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ married ^ ^ a ^ ^ dumbass *, 
  oh , it 's a link ... yes you should have . 
  ^ ^ mom ^ ^ my ^ ^ children ^ ^ are ^ ^ poor, 
   would be required by law to report serious breaches to national authorities how can this be enforceable ? 
  if a breach happened but it did n't affect the front-end part of a system and the employees were ndad , which they are in all major tech companies , there would be no proof . 
  thanks for the cheap furniture , i guess . 
  i honestly just think that his electoral committee is focusing on reddit . 
  because that 's the problem with terrorists . 
  ** pizza !, 
  ** , and when the flag is old , ireland !, 
  / s -- more seriously : the `` tricolore '' ( tricolour ) was born in 1794 , when two students from bologna tried a coup against the 200 years of absolutist government . 
  the cockade is heavily inspired by the french revolution one but with green instead of blue . 
  the meaning stayed the same : liberty , equality , fraternity . 
   azerbaijan well , they had the european games there , but yeah , not europe . 
  muslims are just 0.06 % of the people in the city i live , mainly sunni and no extremist faction . 
  there has never been any problem or anything news worthy about them that i can remember . 
  they just live their life like anyone else . 
  2/10 would get stuck in traffic on the salerno-reggio calabria . 
  ... from the north . 
   president barack obama beat russia 's president putin to the punch til putin , age 7 , got beat up by obama , age fetus -1 in 1959, 
  should have used `` ecc '' , did n't remember it at the time . 
  generally the us thinks of the founding members of ~ ~ europe ~ ~ ecc . 
  [ i think this is more suited . ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sxeh3fs.jpg ) . 
  tip : look at the first word in this sentence . 
  italians work so much because we are drowned by a ridiculous amount of bureaucracy . 
  i love their meat cusine !, 
  [ such dacia , much wow .

  fiumicino is pretty much the hardest italian beach to land on as an illegal immigrant ... 
  i think that photo portrays a secluded area next to an high traffic road , used as an open air illegal landfill . 
   also the us also does n't have complete freedom of panorama . 
  italy has none , any commercial use requires official approval . 
  \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0456\u0446\u0456\u044f upvoted this comment . 
  there 's always time / s ^ ^ ^ ^ adness, 
   finland  record heat top kljasd, 
   a school teacher in bavaria was fined more than 12,000 eur for ** giving students electric shocks **  i would expect jail time too , that 's torture . 
  now we have a separate one for : police , gendarmerie , ambulance , firefighters , forest police , coast guard . 
  finally an unique number will be available , 112 . 
  italy * public administration reform approved * 112 will be the unique emergency number ( we had 6 different ones ) * enviromental protection police merged with police * more dynamic job market for public employees * light bills payable with phone credit * easier access to public documents * mob attack on a * presumed * gay man * lot of cities with 40 \u00b0 + weather * underage kid died in a club for liquid ecstasy od, 
  you guys steamrolled us in the semi finals , this was a really deserved gold . 
  ^ edit : ^ i ^ ca n't ^ sport, 
  yes , we have a semi-proportional system with a minimum threshold plus representatives for autonomous regions , and new electoral rules will come up before the next elections . 
  you can do a votes chart but alliances and coalitions have been made and broken multiple times after the 2013 vote , so the representatives in seat are pretty different from those results . 
  it 's complicated . 
  til italy is more socialist then france .

  * there were 3.279 deaths by shipwreck in 2014 , 2400 deaths in 2015 but expected to grow to 4.000 by the end of the year . 
  * the leader of movimento 5 stelle , the main opposition party , is talking about closer surveillance and harder approval rules for refugees , joining the voice of right wing parties on the matter . 
  oh , the irony of this sentence . 
  i 'd want to be french if it was n't for those pesky frenchmen . 
  the catholic church has a preferential treatment above other religions by law : the constitution references to the lateran treay , a set of agreements made during the fascist regime ( 1929 , to be precise ) . 
  if a children is born from at least a baptized parent he/she ' s considered automatically catholic by the church and the state even in official statistics . 
  a lot of young people now are just indifferent albeit still have a religious marriage / have religious funerals . 
  looking at our republican history , after wwii , no government has aver been elected without the vatican 's support . 
  even the communist party , which was much more relevant when the ussr still existed , has always had friendly ties with them . 
  a lot of social issues about lgbt and woman rights are still poorly discussed because of resilience from cei ( italian episcopal conference ) , which is the organism that interfaces the vatican with italian politics , albeit this is slowly changing in recent years , with cei 's voice being relatively less loud in recent years . 
  -- a little bit of tax math follows :  there is an income tax called `` 8x1000 '' , where each year a citizien has to choose to give 0,8 % of its income to a pool for one of 10 religious entities or the state ( you are not obliged to specify to whom , in fact explicit specification is around 43 % ) . 
  to distribute the money of this pool :   * generate total 8x1000 income  * count signings for each entities  * contributors choice have the same weight , indipendently from contriubutor 's income  * if a person did n't specify , it 's percentage is distributed according to the resulting proportions an interesting fact : public schools have non mandatory irc ( acronym for catholic religion teaching ) if a student adeheres to it the irc teacher has a vote for promotion/failure , plus if he/she 's in high school and chose to follow irc some credits for the final hc grade are given , the alternatives give no credits . 
  irc teachers get chosen by the state but if they are deemed not worthy by the catholic church they can be fired . 
  edit : added 8x1000 , and corrected grammar . 
  * if you cry when you 're in love , it sure ai n't no disgrace . 
  no , thank you for delicious sp\u00e4tzle . 
  yes , that 's san marino . 
  if i sound repetitive it 's b/c either you edited your post in less then 3 minutes or i misread what you wrote . 
  san marino is on the bottom of the part of italy that is in continental europe . 
  vatican city 's official language is latin , `` cerevisia/cervisia '' is latin for beer and the arrow points at rome , so it aims at vatican city , but good luck finding someone in that enclave that sells beer , if anything .
