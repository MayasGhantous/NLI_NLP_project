  that 's the diplomatic equivalent of `` well ... you too ! '' . 
  what a puerile reaction from the us . 
  and ass would be a more apt term to define his face ... other than that , i fully agree with / u/nounhud take on this subject .

  but nah , we need a weaker eu . 
  lol , fun to see that le pen is being the most coherent of the whole bunch . 
  it 's quite interesting that the wealthier the country of origin the more welcome the people are . 
  i would argue that , as of now , syrians are `` worse '' than somali . 
  no , because nypost is the us 's sun equivalent .

  marvellous , they ca n't even correctly credit their own writers :  nicole gelinas is a contributing editor to the manhattan institute 's city journal . 
  holy shit , this sub 's standards are getting lower everyday and mods simply stopped to care . 
  eh , you 're right . 
  we wo n't see the situation improve here * at least * for the next 7 years ( this government + the next ) . 
  and even then we would still need massively unpopular socioeconomic reforms . 
  no , but the premise of this thread implies some form of threat ( * had to leave * ) . 
  it 's better to be dirt poor in your own country , especially if the climate is temperate , so nothing but political prosecution remains as a reason to leave . 
  still better than an american style pizza . 
  edit : my pasta sauce has enough salt now , pls stop, 
  me too , but more out of self-interest : france has historically been welcoming of politically prosecuted people . 
  something something rupert murdoch, 
  i 'm more then ok with a more thorough security clearance before joining , but this has to be done by someone not in the military . 
  i 'm not comfortable with this blurring of military and police responsibility . 
  i bet half the reason is just to annoy those pesky conservatives in the south . 
  something tells me they do n't have strong winds there . 
  hello there , stalin . 
   especially funding by arabs . 
  eh , that would be useless too . 
  just create a bogus company registered to a complacent dutch person and pour money into whatever you want . 
  tbh making illegal border crossing a crime means that those people are owed court trials , de facto lengthening their illegal presence in the country . 
  it 's better to just send them back and putting them in a blacklist . 
  not really , the workaround is simple . 
  create a permanent eu command with units assigned from all the various members . 
  you do n't need to convert 100 % of the military . 
  pr wise , yes . 
  it would need quite a lot of effort . 
  they are already mandated to show their faces if an officier asks ...

  personnel or equipment is not lacking , and the people directly affected are around ~ 3000 .

  as of now their chances are 50/50 against the government parties and an almost sure win against an hypothetical right wing coalition . 
  they are kinda the child of le pen and maduro , just without the racism .
