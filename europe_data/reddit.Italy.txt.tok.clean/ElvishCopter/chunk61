  i agree , what-aboutism is the wrong term . 
  at the time of my previous comment it seemed appropriate for `` loosely related comment with intention of shifting the discussion towards low level bickering '' .

  not much more , the parliament went into a `` summer pause '' starting august 4th up to september 13 ( 6 weeks ... ) . 
  that 's italy 's politics for ya 'll .

  carabinieri were a sort of royal guard , but they always had police roles in rural areas . 
  as of today carabinieri are military while the police are civilian . 
  they are seen as a more `` rural '' force but there are both police and carabinieri stations in all cities of a certain size . 
  a downside of having two forces is more problem with coordination and higher costs . 
  this is not completely negative : assume that you need to file a report for stolen documents . 
  if the local police/carabinieri station is badly managed and they take ages or are unprofessional you could try going to the carabinieri/police to see if they can get things done . 
  yet you still get billed by rai .
