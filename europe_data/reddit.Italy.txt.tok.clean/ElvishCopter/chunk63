  last year mr grillo tried to get his mps to vote against decriminalising illegal immigration ; he was thwarted by a grassroots mutiny . 
  in turin , the party is aligned with the sometimes violent resistance by environmentalists to a high-speed rail link through the alps to france . 
  ms appendino 's governing programme vows to promote veganism . 
  the right-wing voters who back it as a protest may not like such policies if it wins . 
  worse , the movement 's efforts to solicit citizen input , however laudable , have left its platform a hotchpotch of ingenuousness , cynicism and ambiguity . 
  its foreign policies are suffused with anti-americanism . 
  one of its leading members wants to involve leftist latin american governments in middle east peace talks . 
  another returned from russia to declare that vladimir putin should be considered an ally and sanctions should be dropped , since they hurt italy 's food and furniture exports . 
  on economics , m5s 's main policy is to demand a referendum on the euro . 
  this may be unconstitutional ; in any case , m5s will not say whether it wants out or in . 
  coherent or not , these policies are popular . 
  an average of recent polls puts the movement less than a percentage point behind the pd . 
  in a run-off between the two , polls find , m5s would win . 
  italy may well end up granting its government more power , only to elect a party that has no idea how to use it . 
  my ideal would be a mix of s&d and alde , the realistical choice would be s&d .

  was he a vegetarian ?

  double tap,

  i only see a glorious monument to consumerism . 
  my bad , i thought you were talking about the west in general . 
  that 's what daesh is fighting against , not single countries . 
  the various drone campaigns are ... controversial in the countries where they are deployed . 
  it 's one thing when civilians get killed , but france military is volunteer . 
  i do n't see how this made international news . 
  no one in europe is less rectangular than us . 
  i think we call it lukewarm gelato cake . 
  they 're becoming more and more a regular centrist party , albeit with a soviet-like power structure , i.e. 
  popular committees on the low level and a strong , almost authoritarian power core . 
  they 're populists with kraken tentacles in all political directions , but sadly not idiots . 
  i assume your assumption of my assumption is somewhat speculative . 
  eh , there 's no real defence in those situation , beside full body armor . 
  he was effective 90 % because of surprise , like most rampages and planned attacks are . 
  neither pushing an agenda , in whichever direction .

  i think it qualifies .

  this just in : turkey reaches energy independence thanks to the new spinning atat\u00fcrk turbine \u2122 . 
  erdogan was on vacation , this is incredibly similar to the 1980 coup , always in turkey . 
  it 's in these moments that reddit becomes an amazing news aggregator , the live thread is incredibly useful . 
  to any turkish : ... good luck . 
  * thread not chat, 
  this is an organized takeover of airports and major roads , you ca n't do something this large scale in a whim .

  give them time , they had a cabinet reshuffle yesterday .

  context ? 
  damn , if something as important as the main railway company is sold for 45 millions i ca n't fathom where greece is going to get 5.7 + billions in the next three years . 
  there 's different levels of integration . 
  funny how you pick a subset of indians , look up on communist parties in india and tamil terrorists . 
  middle class does n't mean you 're well integrated , i just pointed out the ones under higher risk of radicalization . 
  both your examples fill at least one box , social isolation . 
  the first from being a disturbed child and the second being radicalized in prison . 
  some basic reading comprehension would make you see `` can be radicalized '' as `` at risk of being radicalized '' in this context . 
  the extreme parts ( murders , rape , ... ) of * some * interpretation of * some * salafi schools already fall under `` illegal '' . 
  implying that a whp\u00f2e school of thought creates terrorism is ridiculous . 
  i ca n't really agree with that . 
  i 'd like something similar to what the us does ( without the military lobby and with more welfare ) , strong military to guard the nation and foreign aid and economic involvement to both make those nations friendlier towards you while profiting from this . 
  we live in a globalized world , shutting down all communication with ~ 2 billion people is not really doable without taking down your economy . 
  terrorism is already illegal ... 
  by creeping your history i can see you are a white somewhat misogynist russian male . 
  try living a life of social isolation and harder access to good education and jobs , and a general feeling that you do n't belong , then i 'll try . 
  ok , i 'm with you . 
  the risk of having them far surpasses their usefulness for commerce . 
  what 's your realistic alternative ? 
  ignore them ? 
  propaganda does n't come from thin air . 
  by taking down the biggest centers these messages will reach less people . 
  everyone with an internet connection can be radicalized , even if you seal every exterior border . 
  at this point it 's just a compromise of safety vs personal freedom . 
  funny enuogh if you renounce to freedom terrorists will have their way : live your live fering them instead of having a normal life . 
  it 's an 18 wheeler , even if you shot it with a high power rifle it would still move forward to to inertia and redundancy of wheels , good luck destroying every 18 of them in 3 seconds . 
  daesh is so efficient because they still have a centralized propaganda center . 
  if you eradicate their physical presence they 're going to be less so . 
  the risk of terrorism has and will always exist , but it can and is going to be culled via military and increased intelligence cooperation means , not by parroting easy black and white solution . 
  the existance of http://www.israelhasbeenterrorattackfreefor.com/ should be an answer by itself . 
  summary executions of every suspects ? 
  sounds logical . 
  please no , there 's a need of a government with long term ideas , not easy answer . 
  rome was n't built in a day . 
  a strategic answer is what is needed . 
  not shortsigted measures . 
  and it 's being done , daesh is losing more ground and getting desperate . 
  sadly an increase in the risk of attacks has been forecasted multiple times , those people are n't going to go away in a quiet manner . 
  just camo , statisticians wo n't find them and unemployment will lower . 
  well , to be fair france 's military/gdp has always been well above the 2 % threshold suggested by nato . 
  uk , estonia , poland and france are following that , it 's the rest that is being too frugal . 
  monthy income lower or equal to the following falls under poverty line .

  joke 's on you . 
  italy does n't have a minimum wage , and the political will to introduce it is extremely minoritarian . 
  unions are also against this because they would lose power . 
  it is a difficult situation , it 's true that migration increases competition , especially in lower wage jobs .
