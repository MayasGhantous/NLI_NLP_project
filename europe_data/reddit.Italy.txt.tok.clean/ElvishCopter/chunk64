  it 's also a fact that the nation needs more young people to sustain itself , we 've already the second median oldest population in the eu . 
  italy 's fertility rate is at 1.37 and lowering each year . 
  even if people started birthing child at the replacement fertility rate of 2.1 right now we would still need something to pad 20 years of insufficient young people population . 
  there 's high unemployment , but even if 100 % of people found a job the situation would n't significantly improve . 
  legal migrants are actually less unemployed than italians , the migration problem is the hundred of thousands asylum seekers that take years to process while forbidden to work , and the nonfunctioning expulsion system .

  about your second question : nah , the worst poll results showed that only 33 % would want a referendum on eu membership , and even then best result for an italeave ( i still prefer uscita , literally * exit * in italian ) would be 25 % . 
  almost of our relevant parties are pro eu , the poll sum of all anti-eu ( populist/far right * northern league * + * brothers of italy * nationalists ) ones is under 16 % . 
  it 's almost sure that a national-populist party will win the next elections . 
  they 're not going to do anything blatantly unpopular like tsipras did . 
  and you forget that italy has much more bargaining power than greece , or anyone else in pi ( i ) gs .

  if it passes lower house will be on steroids and the senate will focus mainly on regional situations . 
  it would effectively speed up the legislative action without removing representativity . 
  recent polls saw yes leading until a week or two ago . 
  with the results of recent city elections that saw the government party holding on on smaller cities but losing half of the biggest ones . 
  no is recently the majority with ~ 1-8 % lead this past week . 
  the mainstream debate was and still is 0 % on merit and 100 % `` renzi bad , go home ! '', 
  even the chamber of commerce is embracing yes and explicitly said that a no will cause political instability and yet another jump into recession for italy . 
  not with a populist as finance minister . 
  i honestly hope m5s will act as a right leaning party at this point , but their rhetoric has always been `` banks are bad , mkaay ? '' . 
  they 'll probably act as a mix of populist-nationalist and progressive party , kinda like a softcore front nationale without the racism . 
  the economic outlook will be better with pd 's social democrats but recent polls are not in their favour , and if october 's referendum does n't pass it 'll be a blow to any possibility for a second term . 
  ` murica !, 
  ** italy ** * terror attack in bangladesh . 
  9 italians dead . 
  radical islam is the cause . 
  conflicting evidence for root cause , some say isis . 
  us intelligence claims it was an independent group *  nine italians were killed and a 10th was listed as missing after militants attacked a restaurant in the bangladesh capital of dhaka and took hostages , italian foreign minister paolo gentiloni said saturday . 
   the nine fatalities comprised four men and five women , gentiloni told the press , adding that relatives had been notified . 
   a tenth italian was in the restaurant when the attack unfolded but was not among the 20 listed as dead , he said . 
   local media said the italian dead included a 33-year-woman who had been in bangladesh for 18 months for work , a 52-year-old woman textile exective and a 47-year-old entrepreneur who was the father of three-year-old twins . 
   prime minister matteo renzi had earlier prepared the nation for bad news , saying the country was `` like a family which has suffered a painful loss . '', 
   the attackers who believed they were `` destroying our values '' would not get a drop of encouragement from italy , he said . 
   `` we are stronger , '' renzi said . 
   `` the terrorists want to rip away the daily fabric of our lives .
