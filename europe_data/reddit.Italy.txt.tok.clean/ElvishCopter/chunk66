  seems like a reasonable thing to protect from fickle politics . 
   the vast majority of voters are uninformed on many topics . 
  that 's why i like that our constitution forbids referendums on international treaties . 
  the poll itself is sound . 
  [ this is the source ] ( http://lordashcroftpolls.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/how-the-uk-voted-full-tables-1.pdf )  total base : 12369 this gives a ~ 6000 pool for both sides . 
  glancing at the data also shows that the pool is fairly distributed for various socio-economic situations . 
   race to the bottom . 
  that would only work if the uk annexed ireland , who 's already doing that . 
  probably the netherlands , cyprus , liechtenstein , and luxembourg too . 
  eh , at least the monarc-like official does have accountability , while a peaceful dethroning is a situation almost unheard . 
   , what does their being expert in existing law you are n't starting from scratch . 
  there are already a myriad of laws for each imaginable matter ... 
  actually ... so well that he 's not needed anymore . 
  plus salary for not even going to work . 
  uk politicians have all interest to stall the situation , meanwhile the eu wants the exact opposite . 
  things are n't going to be fast , but sure as hell are n't staying the same . 
  thanks for your contribution . 
  my scrotal hot air balloon is fully inflated now . 
  too late .

  as i 'm writing this it 's at -11,14 %, 
   ftse is expected to open 10 % down yup , it 's been hovering on -10,4 % for a while, 
  you stole the word from us latins , we are just reappropriating it . 
  the $ will plunge too . 
  less . 
  but it will . 
  1 year for italy . 
  it almost seemed passed . 
   # 100 soo , 80 $ more or less ? 
  prepare for an economic crisis v2 . 
  that 's simply because uscita is the only reasonable choice . 
  ... / s , we would have japanese level public debt with greek stability . 
  uuuh , work in a saharan climate ? 
  italy : uscita ( oo-sheet-ah ) , have some imagination , come on . 
   britons sooo , indian and pakistanis ? 
  denmark 's wealthy and has massive welfare . 
  it 's an apple and oranges situation , and probably even your tabloids are less ridiculous so they have to spend money to create ... something . 
  add that to economy of scale making everything cheaper . 
   there will always be turmoil and economic migrants but in less pressing numbers , and actually manageable . 
  edit : hi stormfront , i see you saw this post . 
  a courteous ` morrow to you , 
  since the autor lived in italy for 35 years it 's probable that they are more italian than british anyway :p, 
  we are in a geographical location where the us wants to have important airports . 
  if you have italy you can monitor and intervene in the whole mediterranean and central/northwestern africa . 
  that , plus collusion in the kidnapping of abu omar and probably more undisclosed ones . 
  abu omar never happened . 
  february 17 was an inside job . 
  i did n't think corsica was that scarcely populated , i put it on sardinia-like levels . 
  because whomever wrote that is an uninformed twat that does n't know that m5s success far overshadows the mayor being a female . 
  or just wants clicks , or both . 
  not really , m5s has a soviet-like commanding core . 
  something something ikea . 
  horse meat makes absurdly good hamburgers . 
  autarchy does n't really work if you do n't have the raw materials . 
  the entirety of sicily is better , imho . 
  go to sardinia , anywhere on the island . 
  think of a mesh of southern spain with coastal tunisia . 
  avoid anything in campania out of naples . 
  jesolo and rimini beaches are also void of significance : they cater to party goers , go to ibiza if you like that stuff , it 's just better over there . 
   ~ ~ gosh darn it . ~ ~ fuck . 
  gosh darn it . 
   with the bulk of those given british passports from coming india , pakistan and nigeria . 
  the overwhelming majority of the eu passports are given to people that would have come to the uk regardless of leave or remain , nonetheless they managed to shove brexit in this piece ... lol, 
  worth noting that , while still in the low 1000s , in a year boats from egypt to italy have tripled . 
  the lifetime of a violent lowlife . 
   completely clean up the system . 
  is murders of lead investigators/judges a serious threat ? 
  because that 's what happened in here , especially in sicily , when the state finally started fighting the radicated crime . 
  every now and then plots are still being folded . 
  maybe the situation in romania is different . 
  there 's more to that story : migrant arrivals are roughly on par with 2015 but since the paris attacks the people in `` temporary '' processing locations or just here illegally saw some 50 % increase , before this year a lot of them slipped unchecked . 
  this does n't get in the news simply because both anti and pro migration parties are happy to have less illegals , and admitting to not controlling those people is a political no-no . 
  uuuh , guys ... drones fly . 
  this visualization is somewhat flawed : if you want to sho the per capita aspect those numbers shoud be armonized by gdp/capita or similar data . 
  english fans clash with < football team  in < location  . 
  more seriously , those people are dangerous , they should not even be allowed to go anywhere else but selected locations . 
  * get out isis * was shout multiple times , make of that what you want . 
  whaa ? 
  63 different governments since 1946 is perfectly normal and shows no need to reform the system . 
  watching the spanish situation evolve is like turning back italy 's clock by 5 years . 
  metaphors , what are those ? 
  most of those are in their southern part , i bet it 's depleted oil rigs with the ecosystem around them . 
  if you closely the lights `` shift '' to what can arguably be newer stations . 
  in italy the two frequently overlap ... aah private catholic hospitals with all that comes with it . 
  and abstract , i ca n't see where asylum can come in the matter of gender discrimination ... 
  and iraq . 
   hospital sources said that the admission was precautionary and that no surgery was planned on the centre-right leader for the time being . 
   the three-time premier announced he was going into hospital on monday at his customary weekly lunch with his children , senior managers from his companies and party bigwigs , sources said . 
   berlusconi underwent surgery at the san raffaele hospital on december 4 to replace a pacemaker . 
  those 2 graphics are also quite interesting : [ weekly attendance divided by age group in nort and center ] ( http://www.lavoce.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/grafico-2.png ) [ and in the south ] ( http://www.lavoce.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/grafico-3.png ) both have age on x , % weekly attendance on y -- yes , they should have used a bar graph , but there 's worse visualizations around . 
  oh , about strange laws : fascist symbols are forbidden here , but you can still buy all other kinds of memorabilia , including mussolini statues . 
   a flag [ any flag ?

  your description reminded me of * the tartar steppe * , great book . 
   the plot of the novel is drogo 's lifelong wait for a great war in which his life and the existence of the fort can prove its usefulness . 
  the human need for giving life meaning and the soldier 's desire for glory are themes in the novel . 
   drogo is posted to the remote outpost overlooking a desolate tartar desert ; he spends his career waiting for the barbarian horde rumored to live beyond the desert . 
   without noticing , drogo finds that in his watch over the fort he has let years and decades pass and that , while his old friends in the city have had children , married , and lived full lives , he has come away with nothing except solidarity with his fellow soldiers in their long , patient vigil . 
  ** spoiler spoiler spoiler ** . 
   ^ ( ^ when ^ the ^ attack ^ by ^ the ^ tartars ^ finally ^ arrives , ^ drogo ^ gets ^ ill ^ and ^ the ^ new ^ chieftain ^ of ^ the ^ fortress ^ dismisses ^ him .
