  undersaturation vs oversaturation + bloom . 
  as of today our right wing is more fragmented than a windows install from 15 year ago , while the left has taken a huge blowback at these last administrative elections . 
  unless something changes i 'm afraid that by 2018 we 'll see the 5 star `` movement '' , which unlike the name might suggest has an ultra centralized core which resembles china 's communist party , win the national elections . 
  they are populists , that in and of itself implies they have no strategical planning . 
  one of my favourite cod2 levels . 
  i 'm ok , as long as we 're better than the french . 
  edit : seeing as rates vary so much the * median * is more useful : 31 %,

  a lot here share your opinion , i think that mv has been the fastest growing one for an italian artist . 
  the text is a bunch of catchy sentences with some words thrown in to sound good . 
  i confess that i liked the diss on salvini ( far right/populist politician ) . 
  damned if you do , damned if you do n't . 
  which can be said for anything remotely political .

  i literally lolled , thanks .

  this sub is monitored by people with interests and that could manipulate the results of any direct voting system . 
  reference to [ bullet point 4 ] ( http://www.independenttraveler.com/travel-tips/air-travel/10-things-not-to-do-at-airport-security )  same thing with your jacket and even your shoes if possible , especially if they 've got shoelaces -- at the very least have your laces untied so all you have to do is slip your shoes off . 
  caveat : seniors over the age of 75 may leave their shoes and light jackets on , and kids under 12 also can leave their shoes on .

  how 's a political ad relevant to this sub ? 
  \\  uk.reuters \\  billion $ \\  eu currency is euro ... 
  we do love our carbs . 
  uhm ... 
  i can see only the first 3 paragraphs . 
  then there 's a gigantic ad . 
  the effect was felt in italy from early 2009 . 
  without the eu italy would have responded by increasing the debt/gdp at greek levels with all that comes with it . 
  you 're including the global financial crisis in that timeframe , something out of control of the eu . 
   italy 's gdp has actually shrunk in the ez , 2001 to 2008 paint a different figure . 
  why they always have to put clickbait titles on otherwise reasoned content ... 
  the guy that knocked the chief should be in jail , but it was dumb move from the 60 y/o chief to run after pissed people half of his age . 
  yup , i just see it as the best point on which to compromise with the eu .

  no idea why they got in a place where fast internet access is among italy 's worse .

  even if it gets approved italian history has refused to go back in time on progressive measures if a referendum is called on it . 
  i agree that these are industry pressures but  the most controversial element is the requirement to have health labels on all alcoholic drinks . 
  i doubt this will change the consumption habits of drunkards nor will deter people prone to overdrinking . 
  they clearly included the vatican in lazio 's average , or politicians like to literally fuck around ... or both . 
  50 to 75 , depending on the city , food quality and culinary culture of the area ( eg : rome is expensive but quality food is cheap ) . 
  seeing that padova is one of italy 's wealthiest cities with no exceptional food culture i 'd say no more than 60 margheritas .
