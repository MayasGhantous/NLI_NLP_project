  you can forget about sleeping if a football team in your city wins something big . 
  i 'm a grumpy 90 y/o in an unfit ~ 20 y/o body , ok  :(, 
  luckily not , heh . 
  does n't matter , either winning party will barf money into bars . 
   representation tiers . 
  mayors , regional governor , ...  we have that already why bother changing it . 
  let 's abolish parliament , all the laws have already been written . 
   well this will mean the average family in the uk , france , sweden , germany etc will be paying far more taxes than they are at the moment where as people in romania , hungary etc will be paying almost none . 
  in terms of social security in the uk unemployment benefits are around # 5,000 a year , now if we have one standard social security system , why would you bother working ? 
  just move somewhere with a low cost of living . 
  i 've pointed out already existing solutions in my first answer . 
   federation with highly autonomous states in an india-like fashion . 
  we basically have that now , it defeats the purpose of a united states of europe . 
  lacks the part of a real central government and common mandatory policies , now you just need to pay risible fines for the great majority of lacks of implementation of eu rules . 
    india has 122 languages  because india is doing brilliantly !, 
  on that we both agree . 
   i agree but it 's got to a point where it 's just ridiculous . 
  do n't change something that does n't work , destroy it and wish for the best . 
   so far all your answers seam to be solutions to problems that did n't exist in the first place . 
  we 're * are * talking about an hypothetic scenario . 
  while this thread is quite utopic your points are n't really a killing blow to it . 
  representation tiers . 
  mayors , regional governor , ...  the high income disparities make having one tax system and social security system impossible . 
  tax brackets  can create higher inequalities as people migrate to rich parts of the country causing a `` brain drain '' . 
  extend the logic of school district to work macroareas . 
   cultural barriers . 
  federation with highly autonomous states in an india-like fashion . 
   language barriers . 
  india has 122 languages  the eu has made itself to be a bureaucratic machine this will only get worse . 
  there 's a middle ground between destruction and stall . 
  well , their public sector is more nordic than the nordics . 
   the digital economy and society index ( desi ) is a composite index that summarises relevant indicators on europe 's digital performance and tracks the evolution of eu member states in digital competitiveness . 
  from the [ official eu page . 
  ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/desi ), 
  agree on your agreement . 
  if a drug is legal in a country it 's likely to get more widespread and consequently cheaper on the black market . 
  it 's no surprise that 8 out of 10 people that were found to use doping meldonium were from those countries . 
   healthcare system which is free as british citizen their british ( national ) insurance should cover all costs . 
  i also consider saudis under a. . . different light then britons . 
  spain has no interest in expelling them , pensioners spend money that would otherwise remain in the uk . 
  earliest i could find is [ late september 2015 ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2015/09/30/wada-updates-list-of-banned-substances/73073450/ ) , before then the drug was flagged as `` monitored '' . 
  i too dislike money . 
  wikipedia says that it 's an approved medicine in  latvia , russia , ukraine , georgia , kazakhstan , azerbaijan , belarus , uzbekistan , moldova and kyrgyzstan . 
  oh , european pussied out and reopened the sub . 
  way to be coherent lol . 
   explicitly said the combined and more powerful defence force should n't be used in their interests ? 
  where did you even read that ? 
  lol , if you knew batshit about how the world works you 'd know that uk policy shadows the us and that italy would avoid conflict with russia until there 's no other alternative . 
  look into [ economies of scale . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economies_of_scale ), 
   an eu army would undermine deterrence and cripple nato , non sequitur . 
   an eu command structure , fraught with divergent and opposing policy agendas , will turn paralysis into rigor mortis . 
  the same can be said for nato . 
   our parliament would be subordinated to a union that today hands down over half our laws source ? 
  interesting that this has no link in a piece otherwise rich in references . 
  i 'd like to point out that italy is near the bottom for internet access and hits hard on illegal content ( tldr special extrajudicial court for online copyright infringement ) but the law aims is on the profit-making part of the pirating ecosystem . 
  i 'm not aware of any user of pirated content that got punished . 
  should be 6-7 $ on the lower end up to 11-12 $ , depends on time of year , wealth of the location and amount bought . 
  probably cheaper if from a farmer 's market . 
  [ the rest of this author 's pieces are n't any better ] ( http://www.reuters.com/journalists/lucian-kim ), 
   nheritance of a weapon was reason enough to be given a license to keep it . 
  hm , that 's not needed here afaik . 
  if the weapon is in your residence you need no permit . 
  dude , turn off your bash and go get some fresh air . 
  good for you !, 
  their spit and saliva chew rates are also ... above average . 
  for  40 y/old people at lease . 
   huge smartphones i thought that was just a drama advertisment thing , huh . 
  unfun answer : local brands are cheaper yet have same quality if not better , there no reason to buy < korean  brand for a japanese unless you 're a [ zanichi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koreans_in_japan ) . 
  their most famous exports overlap . 
   neighbours * general government area * . 
  every single thing in that video is so dated . 
  that 's a bit too much , just let them play ( and pay ) in the countries they offer their services . 
  venice is quite peculiar ... 
  it 's karma balancing itself , bullshit reforms on one part and tax hammer on corporations . 
  i hardly doubt that the same logic of post soviet economies or < 10 mil people/nation can apply to the uk . 
  you forgot stupidly good looking . 
   i do n't think it got any special privileges in february , but feel free to name one . 
  have the same access to the common market as other eu members without the obligation to implement newer economical integration rules . 
  that 's one huge concession . 
  ** hello !, 
  whining because there 's no italian food , inability to stay silent for more than 5 minutes . 
  edit : and weird sentence order of words . 
  like this sub with brexit , social media are probably the worst way to get a * general * feel .

  whoa , double subredditaroo inside , my first \\* _ *, 
  you french people really need some laws for coercive work , absolute freedom of strike is just madness . 
  4 words : ir camera and light . 
  it 's costly , but your 're swiss , so ... 
  osmosis to greece . 
  but automation in and of itself means reduction of workforce , you need a single supervisor to watch over machines that replaced multiple people . 
  but not everyone can be employed in high skill jobs , some sort of basic income needs to be put in place . 
  it was a water pipeline problem , nothing structural .
