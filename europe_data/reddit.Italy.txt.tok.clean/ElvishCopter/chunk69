  then the state should establish harsher punishment for workers of essential jobs that refuse to do their duty . 
  there 's a line between right to strike and safety of the people , and the guards crealy crossed it . 
  superpowers are indeed prancing with ships in the south china sea and talks to get the first manned mission to mars are gaining traction ... 
  not before parking your tanks in those lovely farmside parking spots . 
  does n't belgium have some sort of * precettazione * ( essentially a conscription for striking workers ) for prison guards ? 
  actually ... with the current state of economics and politics a puppet government by a liberal nation would probably help .

  yes : go back to your country . 
  no : hello , want a coffee ? 
  translation follows -- * 05/23/2016 * ** locri ** `` fine yourself . '', 
  this takes place in locri , crib of magna grecia , but this is not a paraphrase of the famous socratic said , but the new categorical order to all those policeman insensitive to rules that they are called upon to enforce . 
  mayor john calabrese has no beard and does n't `` philosophize '' but believes in the example pragmatism . 
  so one morning a few weeks ago ordered his city policeman to self-fine . 
  `` for several days i had asked the municipal police men not to park the car service in front of the municipality , which is a no parking area . 
  i 'd lost my patience . '', 
  the policeman was then obliged to fine the two police cars and another service vehicle . 
  yes , but who pays ? 
  `` certainly not the municipality , '' points calabrese , who says the fines have already been paid by the offending policemen and the technical office leader ( in this case , `` i have assisted to the money transfer . '' ) `` we can not ask citizens to pay penalties and to follow the rules when we are the first not to respect them . '', 
  it could be the aphorism-manifesto of good administrator : calabrese , though , put it into practice , attracting some additional antipathy between the small calabrian town staff . 
  ** arm wrestling ** the mayor , since he was elected , has started a tug of war with many of its employees , bluntly accused of being absentee and privileged . 
  `` a few days ago - says calabrese - i received a registered letter in which they asked the city 133 $ plus legal interest for an unpaid 1988 bonus ; i replied that i disown this type of institution . 
  the truth is that employees have taken advantage of certain situations for years , using the city as a kind of atm . 
  this has produced a very high litigation for the institution , including constant demands for various allowances and benefits . '', 
  ** letter to jesus ** calabrese is no stranger to unconventional initiatives . 
  a few years ago he wrote a `` letter to jesus '' -- which was picked up by the major national newspapers - to help him eliminate the scourge of absenteeism in the municipality . 
   most divine lord jesus christ , i turn to you , in the last resort , not knowing where else to turn . 
   the biggest problem of the city of locri is not only the so-called ` ndrangheta , but also a part of the city 's employees , who instead of working are jsut waiting for the arrival of the `` 27 '' to be able to see their wage accredited in their bank account . 
  an important , but not hard-earned paycheck . '', 
  calabrese is like so , mixing the sacred and the profane , provocative divine invocations and unusual secular imperatives . 
  you guy have it easy , it 's 6/10 here . 
  the current government was already playing tough and comments against italian incompetence are common ( even if migration to austria from italy has actually diminished from 50 or so a day to a dozen a day as most ) , i doubt they 'll do a 180 \u00b0, 
  aaah , they are horizontal stripes indeed . 
  i could read and understand most of that , latin origins stronk . 
  i liked the presentation , excluding the apple wannabe intro . 
  ~ ~ i have to say that the flags shown are ... an optimistic view . 
  italian forces heavily favour italian firms first and german or french ones second . ~ ~, 
  those damn euronese . 
   really religious over there . 
  not really , people do n't really care about religion itself , but are `` culturally '' catholic . 
  this grey situation is more resilient to evolution . 
  divorce was n't allowed until 1970 . 
  4 years later an abrogative referendum risked to pass : 40 % were in favour of abolishing it again , and in [ 7 out 20 regions ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/thumb/2/25/referendum_abrogativo_del_1974_in_italia.png/300px-referendum_abrogativo_del_1974_in_italia.png ) * yes * was the majority . 
  italy is the same country that did n't allow `` laughing gas '' ( ^ ( n ) 2 ^ ( o ) ) until 2010 , and it 's still an extremely rare as of today . 
  the preferred way is analgesics . 
  i speculate this is one of the reasons why italy has * the * [ highest rates of c-sections in europe ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=c+sections+europe&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewix4jg3ku7mahuhqbqkhdp5cmsq_auibygb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955#imgrc=c9dnmhurodulvm%3a ) , if you have to take an injection to give birth a lot just choose to do it totally knocked out . 
  while artificial insemination is legal ( god almighty forbid if surrogate mothers are ) , only 2 out 20 regions actually have procedures for it . 
  oh ,  60 % of medics are `` conscientious objectors '' on abortions , with multiple areas with 90 % peaks . 
  i live in such a progressive country :'),

  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4k3rck/italian_politician_marco_pannella_dies_age_86_he/?ref=search_posts ) title is self explanatory , he 's probably been * the * most progressive politician and a champion of direct democracy in this country : 50 % of referendums were started and forefronted by his party , which notably never held a majority .

  if we put only the 10 wealthiest regions out of 20 total gdp/capita gets just between france and the uk . 
  it 's meaningless information economic-wise , but in a way it shows the huge disproportion in wealth , which gets even higher if we also consider that 55 % of italians do live in the richest 10/20 regions edit : i did n't factor population , durr .

  interesting trivia for the vatican : italian law automatically `` leaks '' in their law codes unless it 's explicitly in conflict with existing ones . 
  you also have an extremely federalized yet homogeneous nation . 
  a lot of your law making also involves direct democracy . 
  i 'd say that italy and switzerland are just too different to compare them . 
  it 's not uncommon for italy to have a gridlock caused by the two chambers having different majorities . 
  i 'd throw san marino and the holy see in there too , they are independent nations after all .
