  stats ar for that month . 
   correction : greek unemployment down by 7.4 percent = 2 percentage points in may as it dropped from 27 % to 25 % and ( ( 25/27 ) -1 ) x 100 = -7.4 -- compared to may last year . 
    edit : another formula for growth rates is ( present value - past value ) / past value x 100 , so ( 25/27 ) / 25 x 100 = -7.4 . 
   down by * relatively * 7.4 percent , his formula expresses percentage variation of the absolute percentage . 
  imo a variation of 7.4 % is well within the normal fluctuation of such an index if you consider that the a lot of greeks are emigrating . 
  we 'll need to wait for emigration data to understand this better . 
  i know next to nothing about it , thanks for the tip .

  the sad part of this is that these naval disasters barely make headlines anymore , the people are building indifference towards them . 
  most of the time they are just sent back to the country where they sailed from after minimal jail time . 
  when there are actual deaths involved they are imprisoned for much more time .

  hej , we are on the same level , 
  i guess what this really means is that there will be a little more dinamicity in international missions by super national cooperation , and italy has more opportunities to exercise with f-35s . 
  but then my cynic side tells me that the us are doing this because they somewhat save money by using foreigners to refuel their aircrafts . 
  parmesan is actually one of the cheapest long conservation high protein food , so yes . 
  even if it 's sliced some plastic wrap will make it last months .

  also interesting to see that they 're kissing the director on the very back part of his cheek . 
  and magically have political ideas once they reach major age ? 
  can i be pessimistic and consider it just a fluctuation ? 
  it 's only an 8 % variation . 
  with austerity continuing it 'll probably increase in the short-mid term . 
  well , racists are not the most coherent people . 
  this news blew me away , it 's nice they 're giving it another shot . 
  above average , yay !,

  it 's sad to see a that all of russia is just a puppet of an elite with so much power .

  there 's a fika for every mouth .

  it 's a nationwide problem really , and it 's often officially legal because permits were given via corruption or a building is made with only a part of the permits and then abandoned , thus laundering $,

  i 'm not saying to avoid destroying them , just that it 's not a sufficient solution on the long term . 
  having refugee processing facilities displaced in africa will be much more useful so , instead of having to transport all those boats in european harbors , they will sent back and that in and of itself will act as a much better deterrent then destroying easily replaceable boat . 
  this guy gets it . 
  destroying the boats is not enough , more will be built/stolen . 
  what is needed is political stability in northern africa . 
  se my answer above :(, 
  one word : berlusconi . 
  civil ? 
  but syria is better then north korea . 
  ok , i 've translated it .

  that went out of the thighs , that come back come back from the legs of the mum with the blowjob of the grandma that she bangs to his body that that licks his back and then then she spits on his balls and they lick his back that they bangs between the turfs that he drags in the grass that the mums nude that grinds in the lines and and they hunch back with the back with the boobs without milk swinging between the cows that rolls in the grass without teeth inside spits on the ground and they but jerk off in the pussy . 
  and everybody enjoys it together and and and they watch him from afar with the sweaty back and the wife with the husband the relative slams them but who does what with the meat inside the body with the body with the meat with the mother with lying on the turf and she beats his turfs . 
  and come back on the ground and they bang the relatives and they wash them 3 times and bring them back . 
  i read that them sometimes too , but like to also see what the hillbillies and hybylliski think . 
  i read news to mainly project myself in other people mindsets . 
  edit : sorry if it sounds too self-centered . 
  about your first paragraph : i live in a brick wall house and when outside it 's 40 \u00b0 c ( 104 \u00b0 f ) it 's at most 27-28 \u00b0 ( 82-84 f ) indoors . 
  investing in a better insulated building is a smart choice if you plan to live there until you die . 
  `` no photo '' , google is a punk . 
  exactly !, 
  and each one of them has a private room ready for them as soon as they return . 
  with the new pope the church 's popularity is rising again , but the overall influence is diminishing , albeit slowly . 
  social progress here is slow also because our political class is pretty old , and until now no party have won without vatican 's support , but for the most part young people are on the `` live and let live '' and have more open views . 
  on the news you can seldom hear about aggression against minorities , which can seem like a bad thing but at least now is seen as a problem , when even 5 years ago this was pretty much a taboo ( real discrimination have not risen or fallen significantly , they are just more talked about ) . 
  at least this means that it 's seen as a problem . 
  a fun fact about how racism in italy works : it goes by waves , some years ago eastern europeans were the favored target , now it 's the turn of black people and synths . 
  edit : added more info to give a better picture of how stuff works here . 
  ** tl ; dr : church still pull the strings but now it has loosened the grip . 
  agree , but to male eu goals feasible there needs to be a common financial policy , which ironically the most economically instable countries are the main opponents . 
  yup , it 's not strictly relevant but it remembered me to go and watch it . 
  fuck , i 've yet to see ep 2 .
