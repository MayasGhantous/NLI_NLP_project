  apple and oranges , classic french cuisine aims on complexity of the recipe , italian is focused on simplicity and quality of the ingredients . 
  it 's hard to find an italian recipe with more than ~ 8 ingredients . 
  the mediterranean is quite shallow , i hope they can get back the black box/es . 
  give back la gioconda . 
  wholeheartedly agree . 
  i was implying geoblocking . 
  netfix , and most other legal means , become a secondary option with geoblocking in the picture .

  a disaster in r&d costs , the plane is actually a good 4.5 generation jet . 
  that 's what happens . 
  there are various tiers of consumption , and most people fall in the lower cost one .

  silly austrians , they think the adriatic sea is an ocean :') at least you 're not double land-locked like liechtenstein .

  generally speaking work segregation and wage gap in italy is lower then the european average . 
  our media have being going to town on `` femicide '' ( in italian it sounds awful ) , even if [ italy 's murder rates ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homicide_statistics_by_gender ) and female murder distribution are on the low end of the western world . 
  the cultural side of hings is hard to put in words ... italian culture still sees females as subordinates to males , not in institutionalized discrimination per se but in the general attitude of people towards anyone that does n't adhere to classic social norms .

  a minority of the right wing opposition have flirted with the option of proposing an abrogative vote on some or all the parts of the law . 
  populist/far right party lega nord has ordered its mayors to be conscientious objectors to the application of these unions .

  low taxes means people buy higher amount of more expensive cars , belgian roads destroy cars , more vehicles = more taxes .

  cars and factories create pollution , hills and mountains block winds , pollution stays in the valley . 
  germany 's ruhr is not as polluted as the po valley thanks to it being in an open plain .
