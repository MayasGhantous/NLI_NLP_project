  do you have any sources on that claim ? 
  heh , in october we 'll have a comfirmative referendum - does n't need quorum - on a constitutional reform ( tldr ; downsizing the upper house ) , and he 's put his political future on winning it . 
  a part of our politics i hate is that referendums get always twisted to a political vote and not the referendum 's content itself 90 % of the time . 
  serious answer : we 'd need to tear down the alps , they bog the air in the po valley . 
  actually enforcing pollution regulations in the chemical and manufacturing industries would be a nice touch too . 
   finance eu-refugee camps outside the eu where ? 
  this piece talks about the * grow * of authoritarianism , china was n't playing `` i control the south china sea '' by building artificial atolls a decade ago . 
  look at / r/hiphopitaly, 
  look to the bottom countries , it 's just awful ( eg : iran looks 10x worse than bulgaria , but it 's actually 27 `` units '' more liked ) . 
  jaysus , that visualization is a mess . 
  sorry for the somewhat sensationalist website , but the article itself is good . 
  ha , our 68 is bigger then germany 's 68 . 
  their saltiness is hilarious . 
  it was a not so veiled way to link another website , one that queries a dozen of so websites for each search .

  at macedonia now , the polish has been the best one hands down . 
  the macedonian is not that bad either . 
  i 'd suggest to download your gpl linux distros from torrentz.eu personally . 
  [ we area a country of self-loathing pessimists , ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sktfeeq.jpg ) a lot of people here do n't realize that food , fashion , history , music really helps a country 's image . 
  italy 's not the [ 5th tourist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_tourism_rankings#most-visited_countries_by_international_tourist_arrivals_in_2014 ) destination out of sheer chance . 
  heh , italy 's version gives no adoption rights , not even `` stepchild adoption '' ( adopting the partner 's child ) . 
  a big problem for italy is what you have seen : people despise compromise . 
  that 's why our average government duration is 1.3 years . 
  the harsher truth is that 99 % of the thing done in luxembourg is leeching tax money from other countries . 
  that one . 
  the practical response is no , i do n't think anyone will be arrested for that . 
  most people will get a union in another city to avoid the hassle and someone with money and patience will fight the cities every now and then . 
  the situation will normalize in 5-10 years . 
  sea lengths are measured in nautical miles . 
  if i remember correctly the closest point is 80miles , but they 're 150-200 miles from where ships depart , tunisia has a decent control of its border . 
  it is true that if they get some 50 miles away from libyan shores it 's practically sure they get fished . 
  that 's not how ... any long therm international works . 
  that 's not how ... any long therm international works . 
  tell that to whoever is the most powerful group in libya this week . 
  noo , just now that the nigerian mafia was going to get a foothold ;[, 
  eh , unless you 're going to have sex with them there is no difference . 
  did you forget candidate mayor 's explicitly refusing to process gay civil unions even if they are mandated to office them ? 
  somewhat literally . 
  turkey --  greece was just a few hundred metres , you could literally swim to promised land in half an hour , the libyan route is harder ( whole east african countries or the sahara ) and there are hundred of miles of sea to italy . 
  a new side of this problem no one is talking about is that a lot of the previous migrants coming to italy went to other places , now most of them stay here so our system is under extreme stress . 
  yeah , eliminating what little cooperation the war ridden countries in north africa still maintain . 
  or should we invade all of them ? 
  you can run windows 95 if you are behind a solid firewall . 
  if you do n't want to get creeped out do n't check k-pop related anything .

  there are probably more recent data but [ this ] ( http://fortune.com/2014/09/14/biggest-organized-crime-groups-in-the-world/ ) shows that camorra is wealthier , i reckon that if we break it down regionally there are area where ` ndrangheta dominates . 
  * humanitarian protection status * just means * having passed the first asylum checks and waiting for approval * . 
  the late 80s-early 90s were mafia 's most violent but also their swan 's cry . 
  their targeted bombings against key judges were a last try to thwart their efforts . 
  sicilian mafia is still pretty radicated , in the construction/protection-extortion/contraband , especially in their native sicily . 
  in the last 20 years campania 's camorra ( naples ' region ) has been the most powerful and radicated in the entire nation . 
  ultras are more tied with the far right then criminal organisations . 
  most terrorism charges were no people died are punished with 5 to 10 year detention . 
  seeing that he was an asylum seeker he will most likely see the demand refused and be expelled after his jail time . 
  in any way those people are now in the europol database and will be blocked at entry in every country with access to that database . 
  having seen fascist/communist/mafia terrorism in the 70 's all trough the early 90s allowed our services to be prepared . 
  plus there are n't ethnic clusters of uncooperative people on the level of france and belgium , so they have a weaker cover . 
  it 's not a vertical slope ... 
  dutch people have an ... interesting concept of mountain . 
  the last giro d'italia stage in the netherlands counted for the mountain ranking . 
  delta was 92m on ~ 190 km , most of it in road underpasses . 
  blac blocs and other anarchist organizations ( ... lol ) frequently travel to other european countries to infiltrate legitimate protests and start shit . 
  the same happened a few days ago at the austria/italy border . 
  every developed economy is a service one . 
  ~ 72 % of the gdp comes from services . 
  a bit lower than north europe , but still  2:1 with industry . 
  let 's conquer andorra and use the profits to ease greece finances . 
  look at italy 's [ tertiary education ] , and you 'll know why our economy is in this state : 25,2 % lower then any other european country . 
  those tomatoes are n't going to pick themselves . 
  malta is in the eu , no can do . 
  it was never advisable , especially for a foreigner , to have contact with the authorities . 
  al-sisi especially is ruling with an iron fist . 
  i 'm going off topic , i should stop . 
  at least she 's still alive , egypt is more murder happy . 
  proof of the will to reinstate mare nostrum ? 
  or are you just talking out of your ass ? 
  europe 's junker sees serbia as ` evil ' ^ / s, 
  oh yes , 2001-2007 were stagnating moments for italy ... 
  the funniest part is to watch our far right parties doing incredible mental gymnastic to justify keeping controls on austria 's borders at a minimum .

  can you give them free money ? 
  because that 's more or less what we did to thwart their indipendentist movements . 
  well , `` admiration '' and `` doing the right thing regarding world affair '' are n't the same . 
  i see the first as a judgment of character , and the second as an ambivalent consideration on either/both internal and external politics . 
  hm , i take that back : http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-matteo-salvini-2.html#/##vote-tabs-1 he 's in line with the [ italian participation average .
