   we are only preparing ourselves that 's the problem , the people clashing have 0 foresight .

  [ atlatropa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantropa ) is the only viable solution !,

  take this : ** case a ** year | population | gdp nation | ( gdp / person ) -- | -- | -- | -- 2010 | 6 millions | 2400 millions | 400 2015 | 8 millions | 7000 millions | 875 gdp/person growth : * 218 % * ** case b ** , same gdp but higher population . 
  year | population | gdp nation | ( gdp / person ) -- | -- | -- | -- 2010 | 6 millions | 2400 millions | 400 2015 | 10 millions | 7000 millions | 700 gdp/person growth : * 175 % * while b as a whole is as rich as a , people in b are poorer than people in a. 
  partly , to compare countries one should also factor population growth rate , of which sweden is near the top for europe . 
  thus lowering the growth significantly . 
  ** grexit now !,

  there 's some 1,5 millions albanians in europe already , just get in already ( if you manage to get a lil more stable and less corrupt :p ) .

  it 's for that reason that virtually all the boats that those people are in are not seaworthy vessels ( on top of being cheaper ) .

  ya sl ^ a ^ a ^ am, 
  just fucking read the article , the first of many accused has been proven innocent of assault and guilty of robbery and illegal presence in the state . 
  they have an almost even tax balance , they get back ~ 90 % . 
  three to four times the national average . 
  that should speak for itself , 
  economy is good ... the job market not so much , as a consequence gdp/capita the region is still the 4th poorest ( out of 20 ) . 
  most jobs are either in agriculture or lower wage service . 
  apulia is relatively unknown to foreign tourists , but i would say it 's an hidden gem : you can choose between adriatic views and the depth of the ionian sea . 
  on the cultural side : if you like anything from primitive constructions up to early 1800s architecture you 'll find plenty to visit . 
  on top of that apulia is one , if not the , most archaeologically dense regions , but afaik that kind of tourism from foreigners is quite nil . 
  it also has quite a [ rich regional cuisine ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/cucina_pugliese#formaggi ) . 
  long story short : yes , i 'd put it in my bucket list . 
   why is apulia so populated ? 
  [ that 's the tavoliere delle puglie ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/tavoliere_delle_puglie_e_gargano_visti_da_ascoli_satriano.jpg ) for you : a 3000 km ^ 2 fertile plain just next to the relatively impervious appennine mountains , which combined with the convenient geographical location caused an historically contrast of density with the surrounding areas . 
  today 's situation is synthesized well on the [ region 's wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/puglie#economy ) :  in the last 20 years the industrial base of the region 's economy has changed radically . 
  alongside highly capital-intensive large-scale plants -- such as ilva ( steel-making ) in taranto and eni ( petrochemicals ) in brindisi and manfredonia -- a network of small and medium-sized firms has gradually expanded , and these now provide approximately 70 % of the jobs in the region . 
   the majority of such firms are financed by local capital . 
  as a result , highly specialised areas have developed , producing on a scale not only of domestic but also of international significance : food processing and vehicles in the province of foggia ; footwear , textiles , wood and furniture in the barletta area north of bari ; wood and furniture in the murge area to the west ; engineering , rubber , wood and furniture and computer software around bari itself ; textiles and clothing at monopoli-putignano to the south ; and footwear and textiles in the casarano area . 
  in certain of these sectors -- especially textiles , clothing , footwear , vehicles and food products -- the region has attained a significant degree of competitiveness with foreign producers . 
  a major contribution to the competitiveness of the region 's economy stems from the existence of important research and development centres such as tecnopolis-csata near bari , the cittadella della ricerca ( centre for research and new materials ) near brindisi and the new software development centres , again near bari . 
  i 'm not automatically in his favour , but i feel there needs to be context . 
  sensationalist crap . 
  what 's the legal basis for this ? 
  please source that claim .

  american working overseas in poland is n't an unheard situation . 
  it 's true , spain will surpass us by gdp/capita , it 's only a matter of time .
