  no paper for write , politburo all take . 
  yeah . 
  we 're at 1,1 % for 2017 , down from november 's 1,3 %, 
  ukraine made me legitimately lol . 
  trade deal negotiations must be confidential , maybe not as much as the ttip , but if completely free to consult * in their draft form * parties that could represent people with 0 knowledge in macroeconomics will have their say . 
  just wait until we reach summer , what you see there is just a temporary contraction for the month of april . 
  trough ** western balkans ** , italy is just simpler to reach in the summer , or generally when balkans seal off . 
   hungary closing its borders , shifting migrants trough macedonia and italy . 
  ftfy, 
  let 's seal off the sea . 
  [ atlatropa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantropa ) is the only solution !, 
  so , brexit finally happened . 
  1 - you 're being too reductive , the `` unfailable '' applies only to elementary and middle school . 
  ( might as well be stupid , but it 's dishonest to overly simplify ) 2 - i do n't really follow you , he abandoned marino and let opposition parties throw mud at him . 
  inaction is different from active denigratory action . 
  3 - yeah , that 's egregiously pro-business in the sense of cutting labour cost and no really eradicating structural problems . 
  4 - could as well be boiled down to the need of watering down reforms to make them viable to the really weak parliamentary majority . 
  1-2-3 could as well be boiled down to the need of watering down reforms to make them viable to the really weak parliamentary majority . 
  4 yeah , that was idiotic at best . 
  5 that would need informed people . 
  let 's get real , most people will vote because of 4 , not content . 
  in fact polls simulating a referendum split in 6 parts , one for each major block of reforms , shows each point a win for * yes * 6 pretty much , although he seemed to have backpedaled on the resignation part, 
  thanks . 
  do you happen to have more reliable sources regarding the second claim ? 
  edit : ~ ~ the comment will stay removed until a more reliable source is submitted . ~ ~ edit2 : to whomever submitted the report . 
  at first the comment cited a conspiracy website to back up a claim , this breaks the rule about linking to disreputable sources . 
  the comment that we all see now does not contain any rule breaking content . 
  i 'll just be upfront : you 'd have to agree that you purposely posted an extremely biased view that in no way would have led to an healthy discussion . 
  looks like egyptian clips from an agenda driven youtube channel , do you happen to have a counterargument of your own ? 
  from now on you 're my travel nemesis . 
  well , we have huge disparity in infrastructure quality and i was thinking for a worse case scenario . 
  seeing as you 're either a tourist or a decently ranked executive you probably went on a freccia * x * ( was eurostar ) , which only links main stations and has nice quality and a premium price . 
  if you need a regional train you 'd better account for at least 30 minute buffer for any connecting train in your travel , and hope that no one that day wants a 80 kph hug . 
  same thing with highways , they 're usually pretty well kept , but rural roads are usually in abysmal conditions . 
  with all that said i have pretty limited experience of travel outside of italy and am probably following the national pastime of complaining that water is damp . 
  that would be nice indeed tuscany is comparable to england with a better climate , if we ignore the economy side of things . 
  on time to be late , yes . 
  eh , the medical care part would be problematic . 
  tip : when i posted on this weekly post i just used [ this ] ( http://www.corriere.it/news/settimana.shtml ) and ansa.it + letti cattegory ( clicca su un qualsiasi articolo e guarda il menu a destra ) . 
  one more : ** children can be given the mother 's surname ** , says a recent constitutional court ruling . 
  the echr already reprimanded italy on the unjust preference towards the father 's surname . 
  the situation is still murky , seeing as the constitutional court called for a legislative clarification in 2006 . 
  they do have a conservative view towards immigration and view nationality as a boosting factor for welfare bestowal . 
  but yeah , that alone is not alt-right . 
  in classic italian tradition we have a myriad of parties , the alt-right populism wave is split into two . 
  m5s is not extremist and somewhat progressive , northern league is a far-right ish party that can be put in the same political bubble of le pen 's fn . 
  i 'll start : [ scampia , naples .

  jaysus , i spot a not-so-subtle easter egg . 
  vergnano is pretty good and has a reasonable price . 
  too bad it does n't have capillar diffusion . 
  illy and pellini also more than holds their own . 
  as popularity goes lavazza and segafredo are the more popular ones . 
  they 're good if you want liquid caffeine , but nothing more imho . 
  i 'd just go with instant coffee or energy drinks at that point . 
  the fact that no one mentioned sardinia is telling , the touristic potential of the island is nearly unknown by foreigners . 
  you get cristal clear waters everywhere but the main 2-3 towns of the island . 
  the island is also home to the unique archaeological remains of the [ nuragic civilization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuraghe ) . 
  we need more kebabs , and less kebabs . 
  this is a fun one : while not widely used , it was * forza italia * ( go italy ) but then berlusconi made a party with that name and the motto quietly stopped being used . 
  i do n't have one . 
  living in a old building with walls deep like a bunker has its benefits . 
  i loaned the elvish part from a previous go-to username , and helicopters are cool . 
  this was supposed to be hellvishcopter , but sounded too tryhard-ish . 
  now that i see it written it does n't look half bad , hm . 
  i 'm jumping on it before it 's too late . 
  here in italy we recently had a case that sparked a heated yet quickly deflated debate . 
  people were showed overwhelmingly to be * not against * some form of interruption of care for chronic situations , yet explicit approval is down from 10 years ago . 
  until the catholic church stays intertwined with italian culture and politics we 'll see no actual discussion on a law , every decade or so euthanasia becomes a major debate point for a short time but quickly returns into the shadows . 
  having one the oldest and higher aging population in the planet will further slow any progress in this field , since older populations are and well , will always be socially conservative . 
  a good half of the time it was just for the residential breaker engaging when going over capacity . 
  when i lived in a small town ( < 8k people ) maybe once a year , now maybe once in the last 5 years during an heatwave . 
  i do n't think ever due to damage to the lines . 
  the ticket get sent to your residence . 
  but it `` expires '' if it 's not collected in 5 years . 
  in practice they are not going to use collection agencies if the fine is low , so for low amounts it 's up to honesty . 
  yes , if it 's a proved political dissident .

  i 've seen it described as a scar-esque weapon : heavy use of lightweight polymers , easy barrel swap , that kind of deal . 
  it 's slowly been replacing the old metallic m16a4-ish [ ar 70/90 ] ( https://i.imgur.com/eubumnf.jpg ) since 2010 . 
  ( pardon the poor image , ca n't seem to find good ones of the military verison ), 
  in areas legally bilingual areas it 's possible to have signs with up to 2 languages , for legibility . 
  they also must have the same font and size . 
  - german/italian , bolzano autonomous province , s\u00fcdtirol - ladin/german/italian , some towns in trentino [ technically it violates the road code ] - friulan/german/italian , incomplete implementation in friuli-venezia-giulia - occitan/italian , some piedmontese towns - sardinian/sassarese/cagliaritan / italian , sardinia has up to 3 of those , further complicated by not having a standardized written alphabet - french/italian/local dialects/german , vall\u00e9e d'aoste has almost exclusevely french signs everywhere but aosta and bilingual french/local dialect in some towns . 
  touristic signs and the likes can have a combination of any other language . 
  the [ italian wikipedia page ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/segnaletica_bilingue#segnaletica_stradale_bilingue_in_europa ) is surprisingly extensive in this regard , covering the whole of europe . 
  i 'd have to say the vatican , we 've historically competed on where the vatican has more of a say in politics . 
  more seriously : i suppose french and their cuisine . 
  other than that ... historically italy and its precursors formed alliances more out of convenience than a shared long term goal . 
  italian fauna is generally on the mild side . 
  i , and the italian zoology association , have picked the [ spectacled salamander ] ( http://www.lifegate.it/app/uploads/salamandrina.jpg ) as a symbol . 
  it 's found only in the '' [ front shaft ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/salamandrina_distribution_in_italy.png ) '' ( red area ) part of the peninsula . 
  an olive oil cartel with spain and greece \u00e0 la opec . 
  the three make ~ 85 % of the word production . 
  not strictly neighbouring , but we 're still mediterraneanbros . 
   in rome - 20 % chance make that 40 % if you 're talking to a vendor . 
  $ $ make people polyglot , 
  [ this old post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/vbkya/ci_serve_una_faq/ ) will answer most of her tourist-y questions try asking r/italy for more up-to-date information . 
  i 'd go with swedish for the european one , love the `` full '' vocals . 
  vietnamese for non-european , tonal like mandarin but much more marked .
