  uselesss comment : the jordan flair green stripe is too small . 
  or by being smuggled away from castel sant ` angelo . 
  * ^ for ^ the ^ grace , ^ for ^ the ^ might ^ of ^ our ^ lord ... *, 
  the old town square . 
  more specifically a tiny triangular roundabout a few meters north of it . 
  it 's both the main traffic point and the nicest part of the city with most of the city 's services a stone throw away . 
  sales histories on all platforms from the past years give a roughly even split between italian and foreign artists in the top 100 , no idea about profits . 
  we do not have mandatory quotas , every now and then the matter pops up but gets nowhere ( a single business has monopoly on revenue distribution , so the system itself is unlikely to see any real reform that does n't give them short term increase of profits ), 
  the oldest architectural remains are romans with the earliest roman presence being iii century bc ; a few etruscan personal items were dicovered in the area ; but the actual location was settled since at least the iron age . 
  collective bargaining here too . 
  we do have lega nord ( northern league ) , deeply rooted in the north , especially the north northeast . 
  the northwest has still a strong presence but progressive major cities cull their numbers a little . 
  nationally they always polled around 12-18 % and did n't get a notable boost from trump 's election . 
  their current leader , matteo salvini , went [ full trumpaboo ] ( http://www.nextquotidiano.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/salvini-trump.jpg ) after `` meeting '' with him . 
  also : do [ these signs ] ( http://www.lastampa.it/rw/pub/p4/2016/11/26/asti/foto/ritagliweb/dfq7566x968-k0kf-u110051104226gai-1024x576@lastampa.it.jpg ) remember you of [ something ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/03/13/01/321bdb8300000578-3489576-cancellation_an_empty_podium_stands_on_the_stage_after_protestor-a-42_1457832626836.jpg ) ? 
  oh , edit : populist but not xenophobic five star movement , that polls at around 28-31 % does use ( translated ) trumpesque rhetoric : msm , fake news and what not . 
  they indeed use trump mo , both in slogans and by heavily pushing `` alternative media '' news sources as the only truthful ones . 
  sardinia , pretty popular inside of italy but nearly ignored by international tourists . 
  beautiful beaches , unique archaeological story and cuisine . 
  at least they have top notch stairways . 
  every tv news programme has at least a segment about what the pope did . 
  we 're a pretty catholic country . 
  major news may cause it to be set aside , but i 'd say that 75 % of the time there 's a report about the catholic church . 
  public tv also broadcasts the vatican public mass ( ? ), 
  every sunday morning . 
  pretty sure it 's overwhelmingly the five star movement ( right-ish populists ) . 
  mostly because it 's a seriously contracting sector and mining areas are poorer than average with economy tied to the mines . 
  most of the remaining ones are carbon and a handful of marble . 
  thanks for the feedback ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  well , most cities have at least a chinese `` dollar '' store . 
  arab kebab joints aplenty too . 
  [ indila - derni\u00e8re danse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5kac5cocuk ) i really like her voice , sadly she 's been off the radar for a while, 
  italian 260.000 . 
  grand italian dictionary of use ( * grande dizionario italiano dell ` uso * ), 
  does `` yank '' bring anything to mind ? 
  if elections were to happen * now * it would be a ~ 30/30/30 division for leftish government coalition / m5s populists / main right leaning parties , but without coalitions a government could n't be formed . 
  talking about alliances now is just speculative . 
  i 'll just put the composition of our lower house , which is reasonably representative of our parties ' significance on the national level . 
  keep in mind that `` centrist '' parties swing left or right depending on the season .

  pd = main government party . 
  center-left / catholic . 
  lately more centrist , many economic measures are pro business . 
  m5s = populists , having established a baseline the are now advocating a loosely right leaning agenda ln = far right - ish populists , strong foothold in the north . 
  insignificant presence in the south . 
  forza italia = old school right . 
  fratelli d'italia = nationalists . 
  ncd = right leaning conservatives a bunch of secondary parties and `` wild dogs '' , but i wo n't bother to list them . 
  those more or less split evenly in the political spectrum . 
  food : pasta , pizza , spaghetti , lasagne , latte ( milk ) used to describe a caff\u00e8 latte ... 
  some musical terminology : lento , lentissimo , vibrato ... used as generic insults : mafioso , mafia , guido ( us , about stereotypical italian americans ) ... 
  probably more . 
  `` a humanitarian convoy got bombed , russia says they helped the government get most of aleppo back '' while showing random footage of generic bombing in syria alternated with sad families . 
  +5 resistance to weak spells -3 resistance to powerful spells randomly changes ( political ) skin by mixing the same 3 colours every 1-3 years . 
  just a minor correction without any snarky remarks that you 're probably going to receive : the full vat on food is only on a limited subset of non essential items ( sweets and alcohols mainly ) . 
  if it breaths it 's got an hastag , we love our gossiping . 
  argh , late to the party . 
  anyway : i 'd like to suggest you two foods with close ties to my regional heritage . 
  a ) bagna cauda ( [ wiki recipe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bagna_c%c3%a0uda ) , [ image that gives it justice ] ( http://www.spigoloso.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bagna8.jpg ) ) , traditional farmer heavy cream . 
  its most basic form has garlic , anchovy and butter/oil * . 
  eat with bread and/or crunchy vegetables . 
  traditionally served in a small clay container with hot coal underneath it . 
  b ) [ bottarga ] ( https://mediterraneandirect.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/bottarga-7.jpg ) . 
  think bacon , but from fish ovary . 
  kind of a poor man 's caviar , but with an aftertaste close to bacon than caviar . 
  found either in sticks or as a grainy powder , the latter an amazing pasta sauce if sauted with a pinch of olive oil . 
  the first a great snack . 
  mainly made from two fish species : grey mullet ( cheap ) or tuna ( expensive but 10x better ) . 
  i 'm not really sure this can be found outside of italy at all tho . 
  * i had the unpleasant experience of having a dentist with a passion for it , expert in its job and had fair prices but god some days you did n't need anesthetics . 
  stagnant economy , with hardcore 1960s style unions always battling whichever government is in power . 
  union power also strongly depends on the kind of employment , with transport infrastructure workers having the most assistance , and information age jobs getting underpaid and close to 0 union assistance . 
  -- ~ 12 % overall unemployment with ~ 39 % youth unemployment . 
  a bad wage gap situations ( 32 something gini ) . 
  -- we are also in a political gridlock with 3 main blocks which split votes in 3 roughly equal directions : currently governing left-centrist leaning coalition which barely holds power , with most reforms hugely watered down to be able to pass . 
  right block with a liberism ( - ism , not - ist ) oriented party , a nationalist one and another one populist/softcore far-right not agreeing on anything but to gridlock the government to an inefficient working situation to shine a bad light in hopes of getting that 2 % more in the next elections . 
  a right leaning progressive anti-establishment strongly populist party with really high chances of getting elected the next round . 
  -- african/me migrant crisis with europe essentially turning a strategical blind eye to the italian situation , with  100000 of them arriving each year for the past 3-4 years . 
  ( ultra tl ; dr-ing here ) the french and belgian terror attacks and the balkan route closing/turkish deal caused migrants going north from being largely `` transparent '' to being locked here and eu assistance funds lowering each year even if more migrants arrive . 
  this increasing amounts of migrants are being redistributed on all italian territory and is cause of high social tension , luckily no relevant violent acts yet and strain on italy 's dire financial situation . 
  -- financial situation ? 
  our financial institutions are in a dire position with garbage title crisis which caused the government to intervene to help investors . 
  the government solutions are on the verge of eu law and as such are mediocre not long-term effective measures ( which would be even worse with no eu constraints , italy always solved financial crisis by rising the public debt , and we are not japan ) . 
  -- self defence reforms of any kind are seen as extremist and getting endorsed only by highly controversial parties , thus hindering any discussion about them . 
  this is a minor one but every now and then it emerges when x killing y in a self defence situation reaches national news . 
  switzerland cancelling was just a formality left from their weaker economy in the post-soviet era . 
  france and germany have all to lose if they cut their ties . 
  eu as an the * multinational organization * : - for principles of closer ties between its members - uk is a net contributor . 
  - uk out of would also weaken the political strength of the eu - business between uk and eu would slow eu as * people in the eu * ... that varies quite a lot by country . 
  it 's the 3rd most common sport after football and almost on par with volleyball . 
  more common in the north . 
  in contrast with a lot of european countries it 's way more popular than handball . 
  the southern part of central italy is not a `` cool spot '' but there is still a lot to see . 
  in italy it 's not really that common to say it even to your bf/gf/spouse , it 's mostly used as a greeting at the end of a conversation to your so . 
  / r/erba masterrace, 
  italian here , the stereotypes `` hard-working , cold character , one of the richest '' go for germany and anything north of it . 
  tough and rude are the east eu ones . 
  straightforward maybe for spaniards and black humor could go to scandinavians . 
  `` difficult to get girls '' it 's a stereotype that fits italy well . 
  / r/italy is the place to ask this .
