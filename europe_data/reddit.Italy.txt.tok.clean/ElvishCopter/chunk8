  simply different areas . 
  i ca n't honestly think of an use for $ 500 other than corrupting public officials ... 
  unless he goes all out he could easily save a good 2-3k of that sum . 
  you did n't feel like getting upvotes today , did n't you op ? 
  oh , typical silly belgian . 
  i 'm not in the panzer , i 'm in a [ mighty tankette ] ( https://i.imgur.com/wcbzvh0.jpg ) , directing german panzer traffic . 
  that 's probably why they did n't manage to invade you yet ... 
  i did n't know you were feet aficionados , hellenic friends , 
  but get out the way fast , you 're blocking the parking spot for that panzer .

  this dress looks somewhat similar to the [ norwegian sunnm\u00f8rsbunad ] ( https://i.imgur.com/sdluhl0.jpg ) that passed on the frontpage yesterday . 
  `` russia 's industrial might '' is always the answer . 
  always . 
  translation follows . 
  * a pakistani chef has been brought in to cater for 200 people living at a refugee centre in emilia-romagna , after they protested over the poor quality of the italian food on offer . 
  * the new appointment comes after protests last wednesday , during which 30 refugees from the coop dimora d'abramo refugee centre in reggio emilia occupied their local police headquarters complaining the food they were served was `` no good '' and `` cooked badly '' , il resto del carlino reported . 
  in the wake of the protests , the traditional italian trattoria which currently prepares the meals , il locomotore , has promised to do more to satisfy the refugees ' tastes . 
  `` we 're talking with the reception centre at the moment and will bring in a new pakistani chef , specialized in african cuisine to cook a meal for the migrants once a week , '' il locomotore employee paolo masetti told . 
  an employee at the centre declined to discuss meal offerings for refugees when contacted by the local . 
  but the restaurant 's decision has provoked a backlash from many who feel they are pandering to the refugees ' unfair and excessive demands . 
  matteo salvini , the leader of italy 's anti-immigration northern league , took to twitter to show his displeasure . 
  `` they demand a pakistani chef and their wish is met ? '' he wrote . 
  `` it is an offence to those really running away from war and an insult to italians in financial difficulty . '' https://twitter.com/matteosalvinimi/status/727746120244469761/photo/1 `` it 's not about disrespect for italian food , it 's about food that is n't part of the asylum seekers ' culture , '' he added . 
  at present , a typical day 's menu at the canteen includes pasta and tomato sauce , followed by chicken and artichokes . 
  all meals come with a bread and a bottle of water . 
  apart from being alien to those who come from diverse food cultures , the refugees say the food is also cooked badly . 
  `` i like italian food , but here it 's not well cooked at all , '' said zeshan , a migrant from pakistan who was among the protesters last week . 
  `` many of us have eaten italian food before in england and germany and it was better than this . '' the protest follows one in the veneto region in 2014 , when refugees at a centre in belluno lamented `` montonous '' italian food . 
  the result of russia 's industrial might . 
  does n't really care , mainstream media just report on various states results and every now and then recaps the most headline-grabbing stuff . 
  oh , a couple things : it 's ... astonishing how much money gets thrown at a simple us election . 
  tv political ads are just weird , the most you 'll ever see here is a 15 sec snippet on a local channel . 
  1k still safe, 
  i ca n't see the problem with israel . 
  you 're not alone , portugal :d, 
  the downvotes ? 
  because the kingdom of the two sicilies had too much mafia in it , and we needed a way to get kick away some of it . 
  it was from that day that italy became so passionate about football too . 
  * why are the french * results are : - arrogant - do n't have bidets ( clean ass masterrace ) - wore wigs - unpleasant, 
  he just wanted an apple ... :d jokes aside , stealing 4 $ of food is on another scale then stealing 600 $ in luxury items . 
  the `` accept everyone because yes '' it 's a failure , no debate on that . 
  the problem is in the processing capabilities and expulsion processes , i see no wrong in analysis each case instead of refusing it altogether . 
  extra-eu people actually have a better employment rate then italian people , although mainly concentrated in low-skill jobs ( page 21 ) https://www.cliclavoro.gov.it/barometro-del-lavoro/documents/v_rapporto_annuale_migranti_2015.pdf  germany : 99 , sweden : 99 , poland : 99 , syria : 83 , libya : 83 italy 101 , and it 's 34 % poorer then germany , ireland 92 and it 's 50 % richer then italy . 
  iq alone is pointless on an economic and social stability analysis side http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.cd i 'm on the side of processing people to see if they are due help ( syrian , ethiopian , etc ) . 
  i consider blindly refusing help to people in need inhuman , and bouncing people back is useless . 
  i can see that you have lumped europe as a single entity , while each state still has much independence in how the process immigration . 
  life exists out of reddit brah . 
  any of those really  merkel stated publicly in 2010 that multiculturalism has `` utterly failed . '', 
  -  where they do n't get jobs . 
  because they get welfare and do n't need to work , they do n't have to integrate or learn the language because they do n't have to participate in commerce . 
  -  many of these middle eastern and north african people statistically fall 1-2 standard deviations lower than europeans on the iq scale . 
  - point 3 is a biased question , last part of point 4 is putting words in the responding part mouth at best , point 5 is a self referring statement . 
  i have a position , but could you please source your claims ? 
  thank you . 
  we 'll risk to spiral into empty discussion if not so . 
   common military the baltic nations will have just to gain if that is achieved . 
  more or less the same here too . 
  it 's called dark humor . 
  can confirm , we had a referendum on oil rigs a couple of months ago . 
  it was fun to read their website in the days close to the voting date . 
  an evil mind would say that there are some yle people in it . 
  ** italy ** - brenner pass still open , for now ( [ link ] ( http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/mondo/europa/2016/04/27/gentiloni-laustria-non-decida-da-sola_205d0ac8-631a-4d5e-995f-d5a53f1f068d.html ) ) . 
  - an us terror alert has been raised about possibile attacks on southern med beaches . 
  german tabloid bild made it look like italy and spain are going to be the next damascus and palmira . 
  alert has been declared `` unconfirmed '' by italian sources .

  yep , every one of the ~ 1.5 bn people in islamic nations is . 
  i 'm sorry but i doubt so . 
  cheese and honey it 's not an unheard combination , but most italian recipes have honey either on meat or in sweets . 
  well , now i 'm hungry for a honey spread roast pork ... 
  speculation mostly , the ttip will give lobbies more power but it 's not even close to the cataclismic desription some give . 
  phones have `` enhanced '' gps , a-gps . 
  phone gps receivers are weak , so they help themselves with tower position plus wifi hotspot location . 
  solar does n't work at night and its efficiency is awful with covered skies . 
  efficient energy storage is still far far away .

  `` help them in their country '' . 
  easy to say , a bit harder to do in practice . 
  we 're a good travel destination . 
  job-wise ... not so much . 
  well at least we 'll reach 60 ... 
  no italy :(, 
  they 're guns , if properly stored you only have to worry about lubrication . 
  it will be profitable . 
  one day . 
  as an archeological site . 
  it already has that ruin look going for it , we just need to wait a millenia or two .

  the choice is between an economic frankenstein and a bratwurst titan ... 
  i 'm not sure anymore . 
  uber has born because taxi are a ridiculous lobby , a sensible and long due solution is to liberalize access to the profession . 
  i know what i meant , but the agricultural sector has millions of people in it in each country . 
  removing market barriers would make them vote either far right and/or populist parties , which in return would put restrictions up again , with a good chance of getting out of the eu too . 
  in the end the current solution means shooting ourself in the foot to avoid having our balls chopped off . 
  if anything is going to be done it needs to be on a really long term , the ttip in primis ( if it ever passes ) is going to be a first step . 
  eh , it 's big but incredibly frail . 
  40 % (  55bn $ ) of eu 's budget goes to agricultural subsidies , add custom fees to that and you get an economic frankenstein . 
  most european agriculture is unsustainable in a free ( er ) environment . 
  they managed to get it banned .
