  exept for the limousine part , which is insignificant anyway . 
  / r/syriancivilwar might be interested in it .

  oh come on , the eu and us are incomparably different in everything from the social to the economical environment . 
   it is uncertain wether libya can be stabilized in the short term nations should always think in the long term for strategic problems , and not put patches over a gangrene . 
  [ it 's not a sovereign state . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states ) the rules are more broader then just anti-something cherry picking . 
  they just want to avoid diplomatic incidents , which is completely understandable . 
    italy and austrian police will patrol the border together  however , rome has agreed to reinforce patrols on its side of the border on the roads leading to the pass . 
  check . 
    austria ( and germany , according to `` welt online '' ) offered to have their police board trains in italy ( thats the point italy declined as it seems )  alfano said italy refused vienna 's request to deploy austrian police on italian trains heading north . 
  check . 
    austria will still build up the infrastructure required to close up , including fence posts , checkpoints  there was also talk of a 370-metre long border fence being built to discourage arrivals . 
  check . 
  in which way the content differ ? 
  the presentation might differ , but the content is the same . 
  they have all the interest in being cooperative , europe is their main trading bloc by far . 
  you ca n't simply let a wrecked ship sink . 
  that 's what buffer states are for , until na is uncooperative the migrant crisis will continue . 
  everything else is just putting a bandage on a rotting arm . 
  it 's will simply be impossible and/or useless to send people back until there 's a stable government in the majority of north africa . 
  your thorough considerations make me suppose you 're in a really high qualified and extremely well paying management role . 
  interesting enough this move was not a consequence with new radioctivity readings . 
  environmentalist much ? 
  tbh the laws already define who can claim refugee status , the catch is that deporting people can take years . 
  eu \u2260 eurozone come one , you 're better then that . 
  editorialized title bullshit , the article does n't even mention europe . 
  money ... 
  he just wants to avoid thwarting his reputation with `` terrorist 's lawyer '' by belittling salam . 
  cold lawyer strategy and not really a thrutful opinion . 
  well , they are embarked marines , not really special forces . 
  these comments are so peaceful and analytic , 
  that 's not an overgeneralization at all , finn . 
  in theory not , they could somehow manage to store the momentum with a power ball-like mechanism . 
  eh , i see a lot of similarities between spain politics and italy 's , you 'll have unstable governments for years to come unless you give bonuses to the winning coalition/parties . 
  spain , why do you hate yourself ? 
  exactly .

  why i was too lazy to do it is beyond me . 
  however i view that possible merger more as a swan 's cry then anything else . 
  jaysus , now i understand why [ `` polish parliament '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_parliament_ ( expression ) is a thing . 
  yes it does . 
  they might have configured the `` patient 0 '' computer poorly , eg enabling autoplay for inserted media . 
  did the inserted media automatically open the file browser ? 
  unsafe . 
  it might has well have been something more sophisticated that exploited a flaw , the general rule is that having physical access to a machine means that you have control of it . 
  worth noting that no system today is immune from defects : they are too complex to be 100 % safe . 
  but the constitution amendment themselves were n't declared valid by the court , so the old ones still stands . 
  or at least that 's the gist i got of the situation . 
  what ? 
  isis was literally born from a schism in al qaeda . 
  i have reserves on what you 're saying . 
  could you post sources , i 'm intrigued to see them . 
  oops , i did n't see you planned a * road * trip , my bad . 
  i 'd strip one of the italian destination , or at least shorten a stay in one of the cities , and put florence in your travel plan . 
  i 'd take at least a day to visit the [ uffizi gallery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uffizi ) , or even just [ walk around the city ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xozerwu2zba ) . 
  all of those cities are linked by high speed trains , so transfer between them wo n't be a problem . 
  i can spot a pindaric flight when i see it . 
  you ca n't possibly equalize disabled people with fetuses . 
  it 's a cold consideration : but it 's better to ruin 1 life then 2 . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szryry_b7ty&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m45s&amp;t=2m50s ), 
  i 'm cool with it , at least taking italy took longer then a work week . 
  absolutely true , i just wanted to pinpoint that the statement `` vast majority '' is simply untrue . 
  far right in austria is never a good thing ... 
  so , 60 % is `` legitimate '' ( afghanistan , syria , iraq , somalia , gambia ) . 
  looks to me that the majority is still a rightful refugee . 
  if you do n't have a tight budget any carrier will do , all of europe uses one kind of mobile network . 
  most carriers also have special `` travel plans '' with discounts on roaming fees .

  interesting , you consider reasoning via ... basic comprehension of statistics equivalent to `` negation of a meaningful aspect of life '' . 
  do i also smell a hint of strawman ? 
  * italy * - an underground oil pipeline burst open in and leaked in the polcevera river , near genoa . 
  dozens of local fauna casualties . 
  minor oil puddles are reaching open sea . 
  2 vessels specialized in seaborne pollution treatment on their way to the site ( no source , heard on national tv ) - the welfare office declared that people born in 1980 risk retiring no younger than 75 years old . 
  urged for more flexibility on access to pensions for older people as a way to create a more balanced job environment .

  the +179 % is already `` crimes from foreigners '' . 
  without comparing it to the variation of foreigner presence in finland this data is pretty useless . 
  i should have explicitly say tat , i guess . 
  how many foreigners are actually in finland ? 
  an increase of eg . 
  200 % of immigrants with a 150 % increase in crimes is actually an improvement . 
  -1 error is one error too many . 
  i 'm all for a stronger executive . 
  we have had 6 different governments in the past 10 years alone . 
  7 if you count the actual one . 
   who 's gon na be the chief of executive ? 
  the * president of the council of ministers * , always improperly translated to * prime minister * . 
  it 's equivalent hierarchy-wise , but he has a slightly different set of responsibilities . 
  the prime minister will still be `` elected '' with the current system , a mix of fixed members and preferences for the candidates list ( locked first member and preferences for the others ) . 
  the president of the republic is already the chief head of the * supreme council of defense * , his role wo n't change , but the process for his election will be swifter . 
  the judiciary is n't touched by this specific reform . 
  while op summarized it well i 'd like to add a bit : as always with italy opposition is not on the content , but on the proponent . 
  renzi has bet his seat in office on a yes . 
  if no wins he would have to resign , so the opposition is already loading their dirt-throwing machines . 
  afaik most nations have some sort of subsidies for personal small scale renewable energy production .
