planning on doing the same , most likely , when i finish my masters degree , so in two years , even though germany is also an option since i speak the language fluently . 
  they stay in international airspace , where they can fly at their heart 's content , only occasionally skirting national airspaces . 
  it 's not like they 're flying over warsaw . 
  sorta . 
  still , the lega nord , whos secretary general travelled to north korea a month or so ago , poses the governor of italy 's largest and industrially most important region , lombardy . 
  as long as they do n't pull a [ cherbourg project ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cherbourg_project ) ... 
  as long as the derived advertisement is tasteful ( so for example no projecting a giant-ass logo on the side of the colosseum all night long ) and limited in time it 's allright . 
  can anyone eli5 what `` devo max '' is ? 
  as i 've understood it would basically concede more autonomy for the local government , but i 'm not clear at all on the specifics . 
  [ you ai n't going nowhere without us .

  so that 's how it felt like seeing berlusconi win from other countries !, 
  fascinating how we , developed countries , forget about it own history of emigration , especially when the continent was a bloody warzone . 
  wild speculation on my part , but it might have to do with japans ' perceived just-hide-it-under-the-rug policy regarding ww2 crimes in china . 
  well , a unified military might avoid such inefficiencies as 5 completely different types of frontline fighter aircraft ... 
  soon to be 6 . 
  italy : oh boy yes . 
  do n't say it out loud too soon . 
  you might be interested in emigrating to switzerland . 
  i know it 's not strictly relevant to the question op asked , but here goes : here in italy the usual stereotype associated with romania is , sadly , that of a generally poor population , represented here mostly by beggars/unorganized crime . 
  that being said , the romanians i know * completely * contradict the above-mentioned stereotype , working/studying in fields such as it or medicine . 
  i 've seen it used , but not very often . 
  i. . . i ca n't do that . 
  can only manage to make three fingers touch the thumb . 
  it 's been a possibility for many years , but despite numerous fuck-ups on his side , he appears to have a solid voter base . 
  during some interviews made to italian voters by non-italian tv stations during the last elections , the average answer when someone who voted for him got asked why he did so was something along the lines of `` eh ... he 's likeable '' , or `` he 's got money '' . 
  seriously . 
  those are two actual answers . 
  eh , cheer up : everytime you get out of your house , one person out of three has voted for him !, 
  how about this for an uplifting thought ? 
  indeed . 
  apparently it was done in order to photograph the roof of the consulate building in order to see if there were antennas which could be used to intercept stuff . 
  seems a bit useless , more like a stunt done for the upcoming elections . 
  still , the fact that about one person out of three voted for him is ... baffling , to say the least . 
  and of course an amount of aircraft equivalent to a small air force is also needed , in addition to all the support vessels of the battle group . 
  steinbr\u00fcck stood there looking like a petulant child wanting more sweets , i.e. 
  a higher salary . 
  the landing was also made due to fuel reserves being too low to divert to brussels after the iirc previous two attempts . 
  a transavia 737-800 had a bumpier ride down : [ avherald article ] ( http://avherald.com/h?article=489d4c3f&amp;opt=0 ) and [ video url ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=nio38kxye-i ) . 
  notice the retracted flaps , resulting in a * much * faster landing than normal , but may be preferable in severe windshear conditions . 
  still ca n't enter libyan territorial waters . 
  none . 
  regional election time , and 99 % of everyone would n't know what net neutrality is . 
  maybe not * a lot * , but there are quite a few * birrerie * where large quantities of sausages are served along with a wide beer selection . 
  makes one see how shitty the alternatives were if she deemed this the only viable choice . 
  and , well , a sizeable number of refugees from the whole syria mess . 
  yes , but english terms are often used even when there could be a perfectly acceptable italian equivalent term ( `` spending review '' , i 'm lookinhg at you ! ), 
  and putting an english word here or there does not indicate at all a decent grasp on the language itself . 
  i read an article on the issue on the printed spiegel , but what happened with stv regarding it ? 
  but the cover itself is not serious and deals with the * perception * of germany by other countries ... * surely * no one will ( willingly or not ) misunderstand it to mean the ambitions of germany ? 
  correct ( in the process of reading the article ) . 
  well , the nh-90 is being produced by a consortium called nhindustries , whose shares are partitioned this way : * airbus helicopters : 62.5 % * agusta westland : 32 % * fokker aerostructures : 5.5 %, 
  it 's the same movement which sees a conspiracy * to make them win * in the upcoming elections for rome 's mayor . 
  to take into account the fact that even if the law changes overnight everything else can not follow immediately automagically ? 
  i do n't think that it can be called manipulation : the law states that the limit must be respected * on the standard test cycle * , in order to ensure comparable results . 
  this is reasonable , and what set vw apart from others is not the fact that real-world fuel usage or pollutant emission were much different , but the fact that the engine 's control unit actively changed logic when it detected a test being performed , and so it effectively was n't the same car . 
  due to the nature of the test being used now it is impossible to make a car that actually uses the same quantity of fuel in real-world as in the test due to just how `` slow '' it is and how much less energy/power is required to drive it . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** if the test is flawed then automakers can not be accused of manipulating it if its results and real-world results do not match . 
  i 'm not sure i really get the article , so please someone correct me if what i say is wrong : in practice the idea is to change the test cycle to make it at least less-ludicrous that the one used now , which would naturally lead to higher quantities of pollutants being emitted . 
  to accomodate this transition , it was decided that new cars would be allowed to emit n times more than the limit set now , which is valid for the currently-used test cycle . 
  correct ? 
  we even have a leap second right at the end of 31/12 to make the year last a bit longer . 
  seeing the comment section of be deutsch !, 
  is depressing , though . 
  i thought the song 's message could n't possibly be misunderstood . 
  you 're talking about a sub that has to specify that it is n't satirical : whenever that needs to be done it says a lot about the supported cause/person . 
  it 's early in the morning here and i just got up , so reading this startled me much more than it should have for a moment . 
  which is fair enough , but * so far * the motive seems to be linked to past bullying and not to his religion . 
  sort of like breivik 5 years ago : he targeted those who he deemed responsible . 
  [ ok - link to reddit comment about video of one of the gunmen and translation of what he said - nsfl ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4u3ljt/shots_fired_in_munich_shopping_centre/d5mkry4 ), 
  it 's not like * that * law would be unchangeable . 
  well , it makes my country 's politics look stable and reasonable by comparison , which i would n't have expected to ever happen , so there 's that upside , i guess . 
  nah , we 're founding bros in this . 
  gns ? 
  we could give a piece of ours to you . 
  you 'll even be nearer the uk and possibly be able to troll them a bit . 
  you reminded me of a somewhat related quote by carl sagan :  exploring other worlds employs precisely the same qualities of daring , planning , cooperative enterprise , and valor that mark the finest in military tradition . 
  never mind the night launch of an apollo spacecraft bound for another world . 
  that makes the conclusion foregone . 
  witness mere f-14s taking off from adjacent flight decks , gracefully canting left and right , afterburners flaming , and there 's something that sweeps you away -- or at least it does me . 
  and no amount of knowledge of the potential abuses of carrier task forces can affect the depth of that feeling . 
  it simply speaks to another part of me . 
  it does n't want recriminations or politics . 
  it just wants to fly . 
  it 's * wrong . 
  * very . 
  as far as i know automotive standards are the same all over europe . 
  passive safety standards , the way that fuel consumption * has * to be measured in , and so on . 
  same when travelling from italy : fill out esta , and done , no other procedures needed . 
  i really thought the entire eu was covered by the visa waiver . 
  thanks . 
  i 'll now shamelessly blame autocorrect . 
  italy does something similar with the [ amerigo vespucci ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_training_ship_amerigo_vespucci?wprov=sfla1 ) , which was hailed by the passing supercarrier uss independence as `` the most beautiful ship in the world '' . 
  thank you for posting the picture . 
  it is so odd to see them sailing together . 
  still better than the guy with a concrete parking garage in front of him , though . 
  is methane/natural gas not used at all up there ? 
  edit : upon reading other replies if you have an abundance of electricity due to hydro dams it makes sense . 
  it 's not on the same level , but it 's still able to act through propaganda and a certain willingness to use force to accomplish its goals . 
  them being able to produce good-enough armaments autonomously ( and at much lower monetary cost ) also makes them relevant .
