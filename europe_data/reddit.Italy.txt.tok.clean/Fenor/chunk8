  yeah but he tried again the same year , is he counted twice in the statics, 
  so ... before brazilian was a language, 
  you should totally conquer back spain, 
  not my fault . 
  even the name say they are french, 
  5/10 they are n't squatting . 
  they need to squat to know if it 's a good balkan dress or not, 
  why is this belgian kid dressed up as ** french ** fries ? 
  for those wondering why , it 's mostly due to a different alphabet . 
  at least in japanese ( but i recall other asain places having a similar structure ) they have an alphabet where the letter is not our single letter but a syllable so some consonant are missing ( for example in japanese l and r are the same letter ), 
  nope it 's about the kind of cofee beans but yeah water is important especially if you use a moka to make the coffee, 
  that 's a slow barista . 
  plus you are still missing 0.3, 
  a barista usually takes 1.5 ~ 3 seconds for that operation, 
  it 's an apple on a pen, 
  can confirm . 
  do n't care about aids . 
  coffee is life, 
  10.3 seconds is a lot for an espresso with a modern professional machine . 
  i think it takes from 3 to 7 seconds depending on the machine and the configuration . 
  i was surprised in portugal that ordering a cofee was an espresso just like in out country . 
  ofc ours is better but still it was something callable coffee, 
  pizza , everybody loves pizza . 
  ( all the other hundreds of recipies people do n't know about ), 
  we can always say you speak brazilian . 
  only one l if you want to be more incisive add one `` ma '' in front of it or other insults after that word . 
  i have no idea what is written there, 
  meh . . in asia i can always use the `` i 'm italian card '' apparently they love my country , and france for some reason, 
  wow ** brazilian ** sure is easy, 
  and bacalhau, 
  ( triggering people from portugal is easy ), 
  needs 99 % more hand gestures, 
   not that mexico is part of europe it is according to an image on the sidebar, 
  to be fair once you remove the norse accent from portuguese our languages are quite similar . 
  when i was in lisbon i could understand without much trouble what you where saing unless you where speaking really fast . 
  if one from italy want to mess with a foreigner we can always use a dialect . 
  but it 's your country bff that is shooting themself in the foot, 
  tomato is fine if done right . 
  ketchup for example is not allowed and is a crime equal to the pineapple, 
  # \\ #mypresident # \\ #theheroweneed # \\ #notallheroeswearcapes, 
  us flair . 
  yeah about your pizza ... it 's disgusting ... how can you even eat that crappy inferior version ? 
  you are now banned from / r/italy / r/italia / r/food / r/pizza / r/all, 
  this is going to make ww2 like a prank , bro, 
  now that i 've seen it . 
  i 'm triggered, 
  portugal and the uk has been bff since kindergarden, 
  you do n't have it ? 
  we do, 
  still in your photo 0/10 . 
  how are we supposed to know it 's olympus without zeus at the top ? 
  people old now will live longer . 
  does n't mean that those that are young today will live long, 
  is being a backdoor to make money flow out of the eu a bad thing ? 
  ireland got out of their problem by f *** ing the rest of eu by becoming a tax heaven inside the eu itself . 
  since they have gon the tax heaven route, 
  hamburg have hamburger now, 
  fado is tipical sad music of * madrid * i 'm still wondering why there is so many people in west spain that speak brazillian ? 
  old mexico standard mexico , or drug mexico or walled maxico and then new mexico, 
  so i need to ass a 7up ? 
  so ... you are the poorer version of spain right ? 
  in italy even `` pizza with ananas '' will get you beaten . 
  he 's brexiting, 
  there should be some kind of repost police on reddit . _ . 
  did n't google leave china claiming the same exact reason ? 
  not yet, 
  you should have swiped left, 
  cyka blyat is universal . 
  works in every language while teabagging, 
  thanks you , vlad, 
  except it 's actually ~ ~ right ~ ~ in ~ ~ the corner of ~ ~ france . 
  they make agreement prior to invoking a50 with the various pm in an attempt to get better deals, 
  the eu does n't need to do anything because it 's not blocking ireland to do their own deals . 
  ireland will probably become a less taxed entry point for the uk goods . 
  plus ireland will see a lot of banks and some industry move there are they will not benefit sticking to the uk anymore . 
  the only reason ireland is aflot is that it 's the tax heaven inside the eu . 
  if ireland decide to leave the eu you will have a bigger recession, 
  you clearly have no idea of what you are talking about . 
  but you are probably a troll so i will not waste time explaining things to you, 
  uk is n't that big of a market . 
  plus it 's fun how you claim only overseas countries in your deal . 
  guess where most of the food you consome comes from ? 
  the eu . 
  brexit will be a bigger blow to the uk than the eu, 
  while i do n't like your tone i must agree with you , this is how democracy work . 
  i can see northern ireland attempting to join back to ireland . 
  gibraltar joining spain ( even if their economy will suffer from the decision ) i do n't see the city of london attempting going indipendent, 
  the eu does n't care about you guys anymore . 
  you are leaving the party , no more booze for you, 
  as the doctor said : `` does n't you think she looks tired ? '', 
  they where and at the same time they where n't . 
  geographically they where far from any big conflict so nobody cared about them . 
  with ww2 they waited for anyone to weaken themself and then said `` ok we are going to help you allies '' and show off they muscles . 
  the donald refer to another [ donald ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/paperpedia/images/7/72/paperino_che_cammina.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160330135113&amp;path-prefix=it ), 
  not really they simply speed up the process . 
  germany was already collapsing on itself . 
  they where losing ground in the eastrn front and their economy was draining . 
  now the us getting it fastened the process by a lot . 
  but if they did n't enter the war nazi would have still suffered a defeat . 
  i agree .
