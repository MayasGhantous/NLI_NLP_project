i think it 's not related to putin or someone in his behalf . 
  the damage for him is grater with the actor dead , than alive . 
  as stated by masha gessen , the death of anna politovskaya produced more damage to putin and his regime than her articles . 
  i think it 's the same here edit : why the downvotes ? 
  i 'm probrably wrong , i just expressed a tought . 
  i do n't know , i was in vacation in croatia with a serbian . 
  she basically spoke serbian all the time .

  ** there has been so much raw information , misrepresented information , and sheer deliberate misinformation that it is becoming increasingly difficult to separate facts from propaganda . 
  op is correct in saying that hamas did n't fire any rockets and even sent active patrols to prevent others from launching rockets ( and israeli news sources even corroborate this ) since the 2012 truce . 
  they did n't start firing rockets until the israeli bombing of palestinians and hamas began anew - which began prior to protective edge . 
  the prisoners freed as part of the truce were rearrested , several homes ( residential , not military targets , even by israel 's admission ) were demolished based on suspicion alone . 
  you may call bias into this , so i will use only israeli sources here : since the 2012 ceasefire hamas has refrained from rocket attacks on israel . 
  i know what you 're thinking - rockets were coming out of gaza and landing in israel between november 2012 and now , and that 's definitely true . 
  but these rockets did n't come from hamas and more importantly , hamas was trying to stop them . 
   hamas deploys 600-strong force to prevent rocket fire at israel http://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-establishes-special-force-to-prevent-rocket-fire/#ixzz37mfa5sko  hamas arrests terror cell responsible for rocket fire on israel http://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-arrests-terror-cell-responsible-for-rocket-fire-on-israel/#ixzz37mflhn3q  an israeli army general says hamas is stopping attacks against israel and even ` keeps the peace ' when the idf operates along the border . 
  http://972mag.com/head-of-idfs-gaza-command-hamas-is-the-new-policeman-in-gaza/82895/ so now that is out of the way let 's look at this conflict from where it started ( some will say it started with the death of 2 palestinian teens who were shot during a protest ) but i 'll say it started with the kidnapping of 3 israeli teens in the west bank . 
  after those teens were kidnapped the israeli government started rounding up palestinians and arresting them , many of those arrested are still being held without charge . 
  at the time israel was saying that the operation was under way in order to find the kidnapped teens . 
  later on it was revealed that the israeli government knew that the teens were dead but issued a gag order as to the evidence that would suggest that while at the same time insisting they were alive and maintaining that the operation in the west bank was to find the kidnapped teens . 
   details of the ' 100 \u2032 call ( the local equivalent of 911 ) and what investigators discovered in the car used for the kidnapping of three israeli teens earlier this month were well known by security service heads , top ministers -- and even journalists -- early on in the affair ; but not by the public because it was all placed and kept under a tightly held gag order . 
  the blood found in the car , the sound of gun shots in the emergency call , evidence of live ammunition and the fact that there has n't been a single instance of two or more people being held hostage in the west bank in decades -- all that led to a single logical assumption : the teens were no longer alive . 
  yet at the same time , the israeli public was told the teens were being held by hamas , and a public campaign calling for their return was launched . 
  http://972mag.com/how-the-public-was-manipulated-into-believing-the-teens-were-alive/92865/ as this all happened , israel 's government was blaming hamas for the kidnapping of the teens - despite showing no evidence to support that claim . 
   as far as is known , the hamas leadership in gaza was not part of the chain of command behind the abduction , carried out by a hamas cell from hebron on july 12 . http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.603889 but despite all of this , hamas did n't react . 
  they continued trying to stop the rocket attacks on israel and were hoping that the unity government that was just set up would give them a diplomatic way to deal with the prisoners . 
  keep in mind that while these attacks did n't come from hamas ( hamas takes responsibility for their attacks , they denied involvement in the ones preceding the israeli retaliation ) israel would always strike hamas targets in retaliation . 
  then came the straw that broke the camel 's back , at least for hamas :  hamas has had no interest in a major escalation , and had not been directly attacking israel until the last few days . 
  but ever since one of its members , mohammed obeid , was killed in an israeli border attack at the end of last month -- an apparent error : the idf thought it was firing at a rocket-launch cell , but actually struck hamas members deployed to prevent rocket fire -- it has changed its approach . 
  http://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-smells-israels-fear-of-escalation-and-so-the-rockets-keep-coming/ one of their members was killed by israel while trying to stop rocket attacks on israel . 
  for the first time , hamas started firing rockets back at israel and took full responsibility for firing those rockets . 
  say what you will about hamas , but they fully admit when they are launching rockets and when they abduct israelis - and their operations have been focused on military targets . 
  edit : most of the info in this comment comes from / u/moeloubani 's comment in / r/canada a few days ago . 
  he deserves full credit for the research and sources . 
  edit2 : do n't know if it 's relevant to you , but i hope it will make you see things in different perspective, 
  it will be no longer a tax heaven !, 
  also the `` just a corrupt shithole '' is another side of the same issue . 
  a country is not one-dimensional . 
  surely not a country of 60 mln people . 
  the anglosphere has a very patronizing way to look at the rest of the world , and tends to project on other cultures flaws that are theirs , because the media are often superficial and biased . 
  every time i read about italy things like `` they are conscious they had one of the most powerful empires of the past and take pride in it '' i just laugh my ass off . 
  every time i read how much italians are devouted and fervent catholics i simply ca n't believe it . 
  it seems that the average journalist visits italy with a time machine . 
  probably a few . 
  i remember hungarian tough : olaszorszag , or something like that, 
  do you use a bidet after you poop ? 
  buuuurn, 
  i see , like pro and ita , or srb and slo . 
  i do n't know , maybe it 's a choice on how to render data , probably to avoid a cluttered visualization ? 
  or maybe not , who knows , 
  albanian sounds like elvish to my italian ears, 
  i think they measured the distance between every language and the really weak lines were cut by the clustering algorithm . 
  some weird connections are still there , cause they 're not super weak for some reason . 
  source : i did domething similar with `` amenities '' found in open street map . 
  for example things like school , uni , college etc were correctly clustered but sill weakly connected to bullshit like brothel , parking lot and so on, 
  ohmygod we need to do this, 
  oh look , another brit, 
  no offense , but i think this is bs . 
  there are surely cultural , historical and geopolitical reasons , the whole cold/hot argument is a simple and convenient explaination that is not true, 
  no matter what your view is , this should be the highest rated comment . 
  ** no one ** fucking dared to ask `` where is this news from , what am i reading ? '', 
  no , is just a shit show as usual, 
  ouch . . room temperature , room temperature everywhere, 
  got ta love those classy chaps, 
  russia is the big outsider here since its suspension in 2014 . 
  i think it 's more relevant than ever, 
  ** properly visited ** : 11 ( sleep there etc etc ) france spain portugal austria hungary norway uk croatia thailand belgium and netherlands ** just one day ** or short trip from another country : 5 montenegro switzerland germany monaco and vatican . 
  ** drove trough ** 10km of bosnia . 
  well i actually stopped and got out of the car just to touch yet another country . 
  i 'd prefer a competent doctor . 
  this is what happened in my mind as i was reading your comment : `` also all films by michael hen . . '' * uplifting clasical music * yaaahhhh braahaahh * satanic guitar riffs *, 
  true that, 
  true . 
  but it is kinda shaped like a peninsula . 
  just like we call india a subcontinent and a peninsula . 
  although europe is bigger, 
  well technically , it 's true . 
  the `` continentiness '' of europe is just a cultural one . 
  you sweet summer child, 
  i do n't really know . 
  you seem a cool bunch to me . 
  probably the issue comes from older generations , and their association of deutsch with a time when shit hit the fan . 
  it 's pretty stupid in my opinion, 
  ** vatican ** seen as an intruder in our internal affairs ** san marino ** tax haven , tourist trap and beautiful place . 
  when it 's the underdog in sports we root for them ** france ** the cousins . 
  our relationships it 's like the one between donald duck and gladstone gander . 
  we are donald duck . 
  ** swirzerland ** the rich guys . 
  who gladly accept dirty money . 
  ** austria ** some dislike them maybe they perceive them as arrogant , some see them as trekking buddies in sudtirol and trentino . 
  ** slovenia ** i do n't really know . 
  i like them almost bordering with us : ** monaco ** the place if you have lots of money to set your residence . 
  ** croatia ** wonderful country . 
  croatians are percieved as a little bit cocky , but good people . 
  they probably consider us loud , lazy et cetera . 
  except the people from san marino who are basically romagnoli ( people from romagna ) who happen to have a state . 
  euri , which is a wrong plural form of euro . 
  instinct would tell us to use `` i '' to form the plural , but it does n't feel right . 
  italian cauldron : it 's empty , because bribes . 
  then everyone starts complaining that it was better back in the days at the ol' cauldron , and goes in the german cauldron , disrupting the planning to get out .
