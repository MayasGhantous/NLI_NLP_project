old news . 
  whew , that 's a really good news . 
  fuck you erdogan . 
   after +40 years and many attempts , the basque terrorist band eta has dismantled they did in 2011 , if i remember well . 
  nothing new exactly . 
  same shit as always . 
   and allow the heathen pineapple topping no !, 
  never !, 
   the spanish spike is perhaps unsurprising , given their economy , but the french and italian growth was rather unexpected . 
  the italian growth is not unexpected . 
  our economy is pretty awful at the moment . 
  it grows at a snail 's pace and most jobs are underpayed and temporary . 
  the spanish one , same motivations as us . 
  the french one ... as far as i know , even france 's economy is n't in a very good state . 
   italian 11,732 ( +53 % ) we are going to invade you with pizza and vine . 
  preparatevi irlandesi !, 
   a le pen presidency seems very unlikely at this point wait a little longer ... 
  aaaaand russia gets more and more undemocratic as the time goes . 
  nice job , mr. vlad . 
  do n't worry , we are even worse down here . 
  that 's pretty empty . 
  blue ? 
  seriously ? 
  could it be [ ** this ** blue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68ugkg9repc ) ? 
   real jobs with a real wage i hope . 
  yeah , because you know , just churn out precaires workers paid with shit salaries and * voil\u00e0 * , the unemployment sinks down !, 
  well , that 's a problem . 
  i hope french people ( and french turks in particular ) will vote using their brains and not their stomachs . 
  oh my fucking god . 
  tv is really bad for your brain . 
  well , at least it became a decent city , here we still live in third world . 
  if i ever met some northener who said he would really love to live in sicily , i would probably say him : `` are you fucking crazy ? '', 
  and this is why to be born and growing up in sicily and southern italy as a whole is the worst thing to ever happen to a western child . 
   sicilian : tritrolu * tritolo * in italian means dynamite . 
  hmmm ... could it be a coincidence ? 
  there are elections in-beween , so i do n't think it 's to be expected 100 % . 
  yeeeee , my country , yeeeeee ... :(, 
  orwell 's comment : * the book i wrote was not meant as a manual to create a dystopic world . 
  it was just a fucking fantascientific book . 
   italy : 55 % as always , we 're last . 
  the problem that m5s is getting more and more consent . 
  and our people wo n't like techoncrats because `` the eu is a dictatorship , it 's eeeeevil !!, 
  ! 111 '' and `` not elected governmeeeeeent ! 1 ! 11 !! 1 !, 
   so , i 'm supposing is the same for the french unenployment rate , or not ? 
  i suppose it 's the same thing . 
  nope . 
  nope , the unemployment rate is not calculated on the total population , but on the active part of it ( 15-64 years ) . 
  same for youth unemployment ( in a smaller age range , of course ) . 
  i think the active italian population is around 38 million so it 's like 4 million of umemployed . 
   merkel is about as reactive as argon , and as proactive as a potato peel which means ... 
  yeah , yeah , good idea ... only that our youth unemployment rate is too much high . 
  noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ( continues for 34444 years ) ooooooooooooooo . 
  i honestly ** hope ** hard it 's going to happen . 
  maybe after that people will wake up . 
  and yet us we 're nearer and nearer to getting to greek levels . 
  merkel pls save italy . 
  not * that * holland ( e ) !, 
  the other one !, 
  hollande est mort , vive hollande !, 
  the populace in general is the sheeps . 
  macron = ulysses and le pen = polyphemus . 
  my country has fattened up , i see . 
  too much pizza and pasta , maybe ? 
  10/10 best film ever . 
   which tv are you watching tg la7, 
  i 'm watching the live poll on tv and macron has lost points . 
  now it 's 58.6 % . 
  i hope it 's not 11/8 all over again . 
  what a bunch of assholes . 
  i got banned from r/t _ d for posting [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/69su76/unnoficial_macron_win_france_did_the_most_french/dh931gx/ ) . 
  they really have a bad case of butthurt , uh ? 
  this is too beatiful to be true . 
  i hope when i wake up tomorrow there are no m. n. shyamalan-like twists like on that 8th november . 
   so he does n't even acknowledge the extremists being extremist , based on all the articles i have read . 
  now , i do n't want to agree with r/t _ d but now that 's quite a stupid thing to say . 
  let those little kids cry and come here to write that france will become a caliphate . 
  go to r/t _ d to cry little kiddo . 
  populism and racism have lost . 
  good news . 
   in the netherlands , they ( the_donald ) claimed that germany ** `` bussed in thousands of muslims to vote against wilders '' ** , i wonder if it 'll be the same this time ? 
  wow , now that 's a new level of bullshit . 
  due to the refugees , they are getting more and more consent unfortunately . 
  the bullshit in the comment section , it burns . 
   plus , fellow italian , we still have our 2018 elections to worry about . 
  a m5s/lega alliance ( probably not called `` alliance '' but something else , because of course the m5s does not make alliances with the casta ) is far from unlikely , and it would be stuff of nightmares . 
  thank you , now i wo n't sleep at all . 
  well , it seems that macron has won . 
  now , if you excuse me , i 'll take a sack of popcorn , open r/t _ d , wait to read their butthurt comments and laugh . 
  hard . 
   hope this is the first signal of change in europe for the immediate future . 
  well , we must see which kind of change is before hoping . 
  wow ... once it was the usa to meddle in our affairs , now it 's putin . 
  times change fast , is n't it ? 
  no , it 's just that everytime your favourite candidate loses you 're always `` it 's the rothschild 's fault !! 1111 ! '', 
  and you think everything against your beliefs is fake news , europe will become a caliphate and similar bullcrap . 
   first russian bank gave to le pen lel this really happened ? 
  uh , no , nothing . 
  it was just my opinion . 
  uh ok , that 's something i did n't know . 
  well , yeah , the fact that he worked at a bank does n't mean anything per se ... but i have this sensation that during his mandate he 's gon na help the great businessman more than the middle and lower-class people .
