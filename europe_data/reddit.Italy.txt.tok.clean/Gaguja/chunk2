  could someone stop r/the _ donald ( and relative subreddits too ) and r/conspiracy from leaking their bullshit in here please ? 
  we just do n't want your retarded and conspiratard shit leaking in here . 
  i do n't want to sound like a r/conspiracy nut , but i feel that macron * really * is the friend of bankers and great capitalists . 
  then again , he worked at rothschild so everytime conspiratards hear that time they go full retard . 
  has someone my same opinion ? 
  checks out the history of the user :  r/conspiracy   r/the _ donald ok , ban him . 
   note that macron chose an unusual place for his inauguration speech tonight . 
  it 's quite early to declare victory , i think . 
   where it 's hard for an extremist party to take it all . 
  * coffcoff * m5s * coffcoff *, 
  whew , that 's my same time zone . 
  this time i wo n't have to make ubercomplicated calculations from one time zone to another one . 
   i 'm not sure how much chance a candidate that has the backing of the banks , rich , politicians and media luckily france 's not the usa . 
  weird system anyway . 
  god , the tension is so high my pc is near to burning . 
  ~ ~ wtf ? 
  is that real ? 
  i hate le pen , but this should be a correct and regular elections . ~ ~ ok , i read u/iscreamcoke 's explanation about ballots and the bin full of le pen votes . 
  never mind . 
   erdogan   trump   putin, 
  til . 
  well , i think it 's about the ngo too . 
  does soros have some activity in italy ? 
  i wonder what they have talked about . 
  i mean , i do n't want to seem like a tinfoil hat-lover , i 'm just curious . 
  it seems pretty suspicious . 
  exactly . 
  the situation is ** not ** okay at all . 
  every time i read the news about my country and think about our situation , i want to cry . 
  a lot . 
  we are doing bad because of people and politicians not giving a single fuck . 
  my country needs a revolution ( be it non-violent or violent ) and needs it now . 
  oh fuck you , eu . 
  nope , south italy = greece . 
  the fucking youth unemployment is ** 56.6 % ** !, 
  and let 's not talk about the absolute lack of meritocracy . 
  this country was great to live in but now it is n't anymore . 
  i will leave and get back only when the situation will get better ( implying that it will do ) . 
  and then on r/italy they say * do n't worry , it 's not as bad as it seems ... * . 
  oh fuck you . 
  our wages and purchasing power are amongst the worst on western europe , most youngs are precaires or jobless and the south is greece 2.0 . 
  it seemed weird to me . 
  why exactly ? 
  lack of jobs ? 
  in germany ? 
  it 's always the eu !, 
  well , fuck you , then . 
  yeah , probably . 
  why there are no swastikas ? 
  just asking . 
  happy for you . 
   foreign governments can either treat israel in accordance with international diplomatic norms of behavior , or they can continue ** to discriminate against israel ** . 
  which in his words means : * one guy : * errr ... maybe you are n't treating palestinians very well and your operate is not very ... * * netanyahu : * antisemite !, 
  * * one guy : * i 'm a jew like ... * * netanyahu : * self-hating jew !, 
  * * one guy : * but i love my country . 
  * * netanyahu : * self-hating fucking antisemite * * one guy : * oh , fuck it * . 
  why the fuck everyone wants to vote this year ? 
  well , we have general elections in 2018 , let 's wait and see . 
  another thing : a law , the * severino law * , blocks him from being elected/voted/candidated because he was convicted with a crime . 
  level of cringe : over 9000 !, 
  interesting study . 
  i know why the justice trust is sooooo low in italy . 
  berlusconi 's ( damn him and whoever has ever voted him ) has made many laws to save himself from jail , and this made the italian justice ** very ** complex . 
  i 've read somewhere that to close a first degree procedure , we spend an average of ** 1400 ** days . 
  oh god , this country . 
  holy crap , brexit , orban vs soros , blair returns to politics ... * takes popcorn and waits to see what will happen next *, 
  ign 7/10 too much caralho / s, 
  this seemed very much like an electoral spot . 
  a question : how is the comment section ? 
  is it full of people shouting at zionist conspiracies bullcrap ? 
  god , hungarian is fucking hard to learn . 
  le pen wins the second round . 
  be careful , erdogan will ban internet if he ever sees this . 
  if m5s wins general elections next year , italexit could become a reality ... if they manage to change our constitution . 
  tl ; dr : sharia law is going into effect in nazi turkey . 
  turkey is the new nazi germany , only without jewish genocide and more theocratic laws . 
  italy : the one who has many potential , but does n't use them . 
  well , our former currency was worth nothing . 
   so ... umm . 
  are you italians people who generally complain a lot ( i feel for you ) , or is the general situation in italy and italy within eu rather bad ( i kinda feel for that too ) ? 
  well , finding a well-payed and fixed job is difficult . 
  here in the south , * you work under the table or get the fuck out * !, 
  it 's not impossible but it 's veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery difficult , especially in the south who in the next 30-40 years will pratically have no more young people since they 'll all move to center-north . 
  55 % -65 % of support of euro ? 
  that 's weird , i read everywhere of people who want to return to the lira . 
  anyway , it 's a good thing that someone still trusts the euro . 
  without it , we 'd be ** way ** worse than we are now . 
  r/the _ donald is leaking . 
  this is a good news , i think . 
  how is life in portugal ? 
  this joke has been done too much times . 
  i do n't understand the joke . 
  do n't worry , we are all on the same boat * hugs you * . 
  maybe because that 's just a conspiracy invented by some lunatic while drunk . 
  they are a powerful family , but luckily the bank ( s ) ters-politicians duo is not as present in france than it is in the usa . 
  however , when macron gets elected he could help the great bankers and businessman more than the normal people due to his relationships . 
  that 's what i meant to say . 
  i did n't really want to sound like someone who came out from r/conspiracy , i 'm sorry . 
   is the mafia still running things down there ? 
  well , homicides and pizzi are much less present than the past , but corruption of politicians by `` mafiosi '' and lack of jobs are still there unfortunately .
