  as a sicilian ... wow , the future of my region is pretty black it seems . 
  what ? 
  he worked at a rothschild bank . 
  more than a puppet , i think he 's a big friend of the great bankers . 
  much like trump . 
  ok , now i understand . 
  anyway , it 's normal that the poor want some change ... even if that change is not the right one sometimes . 
  i heard saint-denis is pretty much a third world-suburb . 
  so ... are they the poorest or the richest ? 
  corse and many north zones are pretty poor as far as i know ( i 'm not french , unfortunately ) . 
  the red zones are the poorest one ? 
  i ca n't really understand . 
  why ? 
   you know what they say about no smoke without fire . 
  * where there 's smoke , they pinch ... ehm , i meant , there 's fire * ( cit . ), 
  well , idk ... 
  i searched but the situation is pretty confused . 
  as far as i know , it was never 100 % sure that was them . 
  who knows . 
  oh my , the future persepctives are so glowing that i just want to shoot myself in the balls . 
   they 've killed european citizens on purpose to blame political groups examples ? 
  just out of curiosity . 
  you forgot / s , and i 'm sure you did press `` save '' instead of `` reply '' . 
  and then when i say that the usa treat us as colonies i get downvoted . 
  i do n't really hate them , but they could just mind their own fucking business sometimes . 
  he is tied to the rothschild family , so i think that conspiratards will throw him shit in massive quantity , and he probably could do laws to help the finance `` big ones '' , i do n't know . 
  the only thing i 'm sure of is that macron reminds me of trump : someone who tells being against the establishment when , in fact , he ** is ** part of that establishment , be it banking , business or masonry . 
  do n't make that the european users of r/atheism ever read this . 
  they 'll get drunk in less than 10 minutes if they ever read it . 
  wops . 
  i 'm sorry , i thought it was at 8pm . 
  i wo n't offend anymore the supreme director of tg la7 , please pardon me . 
  to any italian here , at 7:30 pm on la7 there will be a special with enrico mentana about the election . 
  rip rest in punches . 
  i know very well the internet and know i can find very weird and cringey things , so tell me without any worry :d, 
  ca n't understand the meme . 
  fuck , putin 's face is creepy . 
  i listened this thing at least 20 times last summer . 
  it was a very popular song here in italy at the time , and it is still today . 
  no , but i thought someone could n't understand \u00b0 c , so ... 
  here it 's 50 \u00b0 f. 
  sicily , bros. 
  lol poor belgium and portugal . 
   this continuous self-chastising , seeing the ` self ' as wrong , evil , and indeed , oppressive , while the ` other ' is seen as pure , noble , and uncorrupted . 
  italy , is that you ? 
  they deserve it . 
  they ruined the future of their own country . 
  yeah , it 's fucking shit / s, 
  til that water is wet . 
  i searched somewhere and i read that some cia officers were close to the junta . 
  i wonder how the us are seen by greek people . 
  i personally hate them more and more as i read this sort of things . 
  i read the us supported constatine ii when he tried to regain power . 
  anyway ... wow , i 'm starting to think that maybe the us were n't ( and still are n't ) the best country we could get allied with ... 
  they did a lot of shit in the cold war years . 
  is it wrong to think that the recent isis attack in paris will make le pen gain a big number of votes ? 
  we had a similar coup here in italy too three years later , which was revoked at the last moment by ... the author himself . 
  it 's told that the cia organized it , even though it 's not 100 % sure . 
  was this coup supported by the usa ( fuck them ... ) too ? 
  * conspiracies on facebook intensifies *, 
  i misspelled him purposely ... 
  no , absolutely . 
  got rutte . 
  oh fuck you erdogan . 
  * coffcoff * burlesconi * coffcoff * ... 
  no shit sherlock . 
  same thing . 
  i can read portuguese most of the time , but understanding it is impossible for me . 
  that 's the right answer !, 
  how did you know it ? 
  here , 40 % of people want to get back to the lira . 
  what can we do ? 
  i do n't know about your situation , but if here in italy we come back to our old currency , we 're fucked . 
  nope , you will understand what it means , but you surealy do n't know from where it is . 
  i understand but ... how the flying f *** did they manage to do this ? 
  veramente cesare \u00e8 stato assassinato , mi pare . 
  only italians will understand it , so i wo n't translate it . 
  man , i love sicily . 
  absolutely the best place ever where to live !, 
  / s seriously , when this situation is going to be resolved ? 
  i looked ... ... ... ... wtf ? 
  where 's the error ? 
   for instance , czech and slovak republics are about to overtake italy in living standards . 
  that 's ** not ** a good thing for us . 
  wow , that 's literally a second-world country percentage . 
  i did n't know spain 's situation was so bad . 
  til, 
   8 years i checked , it 's 11 years . 
   i wonder how long this will go on . 
  i wonder too . 
  as erdogan becoming the new fuhrer was n't enough ... 
  i find it weird that the temporary employment is less used in the poorest countries . 
  erdoscum wo n't let us do it , unfortunately . 
  we can only hope that someone intervenes with hard manners . 
  oh , come on . 
  and i 'm 99 % sure that i 'll do the same . 
  now , i 'm lucky and i do n't need this inclusion income even if my family has to be a little tight with our budget , but i think that the priority should be fixing the economy . 
  while the situation seems to get better , it 's doing it too slowly , and here in the south , finding a well-paid and fixed job is nigh-impossible . 
  tl ; dr : erdogan does n't give a fuck about transparency and democracy . 
  what the fuck is this crap ?
