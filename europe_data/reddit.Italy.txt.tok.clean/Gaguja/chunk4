  too late . 
  this is perfect . 
  the sad thing is that it 's believable . 
  first , it 's written * hollande * . 
  second , who are you talking about ? 
   ~ ~ allahu ~ ~ erdogan aqbar i cut you !, 
  oh no , dear erdogan , they wo n't let you enter now . 
  erdogan has gone from * pretty retarded * to * full retard * . 
  * facepalm *, 
  le pen 's victory does n't seem so certain now , uh ? 
  yes . 
  wow . 
  that sounds so different from the muslim mayor of london . 
  what u/marcach said . 
  the reform practically gives erdogan an immense power . 
  i do n't think that indonesia is really a good example ... 
  this guy just transformed one of the few secular and democratic muslim-majority country into a theocratic dictatorship and we 're a peril . 
  it 's incredible how sometimes people can manage to do ( and say ) the most horrible and stupid things . 
  edit : corrected . 
  edit 2 : an italian word slipped in lol, 
  oh no , erdogan has gone into `` hitler '' mode . 
  [ everyone to the happening bunker !, 
  well , paris or berlin could be good choices . 
  the problem is : how you will escape turkey now that erdogan has all the powers ? 
  i prefer * italeave * . 
  give this man a truck of medals . 
  man , orban is crazy . 
  let 's not start talking about the israel-palestine conflict please . 
  i know that netanyahu is a nutjob , but this is not the right place to talk about it . 
  greece is the new africa . 
  so , the us finances the strengthening of europe ? 
  well , that 's pretty logical / s, 
  he seems biased . 
  this . 
  i only wanted that europe won the war by themselves . 
  nope . 
  i only wanted that europe won the war by themselves . 
  i do n't think that i should listen to you due to your username ... 
  the eu was created to enforce our suppression by america ? 
  democracy my ass ( cit . 
   last week merkel started to round up homosexuals in camps to not offend muslims wut the fuck . 
  well , that does n't seem a bad thing ... or did she do it * very * badly ? 
  * that 's absolutely fine * ^ / s, 
  til that water is wet . 
  well , a good sign , but i do n't think that 's enough . 
  what she did ? 
  holy crap , why every major european leader seems to go full retard this year ? 
  first putin , then erdogan , now orban . 
  who 'll be the next one ? 
  he looks like darth vader . 
  i live in italy . 
  understood . 
  has . 
  won . 
  stop . 
  stop it !, 
  tl ; dr : pretty fucked up situation , it seems . 
  i 'm pretty confused right now . 
  what 's happening ? 
  rip secular turkey . 
   video of votes still being counted an hour after akp announced their `` victory '' erdogan : * lalalalalalalalalalaidontgiveashitlalalalalala *, 
  yeah , handsome as much as a goblin . 
   hope that this would force erdo to recount the votes or end up with some huge nation-wide riot . 
  knowing erdogan , i 'm pretty sure he 'll repress the protests in ** blood !, 
  ** but yeah , let 's hope that the whole nation riots up and little recep ends in a corner . 
  http://www.birgun.net/haber-detay/turkey-s-supreme-board-of-elections-announces-unstamped-ballots-are-valid-155676.html any questions ? 
  it 's 1933 all over again , boys . 
  erdogan wo n't easily reveal us the truth . 
   ( 2 ) he announced that the next referendum they hold will be to bring the ** death penalty ** back so they can give justice to traitors ; [ mfw ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj7dqydl9w ), 
  ok , we get it , stop with these threads on this fucking referendum . 
  we 're already enough sad for losing the last democratic and secular muslim-majority country . 
  are you atheist ? 
  well , yeah . 
  come on , he will die one day . 
  god , if you exist , please use this occasion to demonstrate your existence , thanks . 
   erdogan is passionate , kind hearted , strong and handsome lel wut, 
  well ... uh ... ok , i understand , we 're fucked . 
  no hope . 
  the only thing we can do is waiting . 
  nothing more . 
  erdogan is an evil genius . 
  well , turkey is part of the nato and of the un . 
  yes , my ass . 
  well , erdogan has blocked everything and we 're only simple redditors with no power of decision , so ... 
  the sad thing is that it 's true . 
  i hope that some european instituction wakes up and does something to block this craziness . 
   this guy has it all wrapped up . 
  what does it mean ? 
  he blocked everything ? 
  if it 's so , well , fuck . 
  we can do nothing . 
  i do n't have facebook , unfortunately ... 
  however , it 's a good idea . 
  some turk living in europe could do that , please ? 
  we were ** so ** close to stopping him ... 
   just spread the news exactly , where ? 
  how can we do it ? 
  i 'm italian and i should be safe but i do n't know what to do . 
  fuck this shit . 
  there 's no way that we can reverse the situation .
