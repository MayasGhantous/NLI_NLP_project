  i 'll choose the second one . 
  mostly in the south , they are weirdos who think that the italian unification was a crime because the south was a industrial power ( no , it was n't ) and/or garibaldi was a mason ( yes , he was . 
  but who the fuck cares ? ), 
  i ignore the bullshit and go on with my life . 
  there 's people who just ca n't use their brains because they do n't have one or if they have one it 's as big as a bean . 
  i know , i know . 
  as i said before , i 'm secular so i do n't really care . 
  ^ pls ^ no ^ inquistion, 
   overall though , most western europeans are secular atheists who worship materialism and personal pleasure . 
  does italy count as western europe ? 
  if yes , well , i am laic but i do n't worship materalism . 
  about personal pleasure ... does masturbation count to you orthodoxs ? 
  also pancetta ( it counts ? ), 
   hand movements true . 
   mafia well , not everyone is mafioso but yes , mafia is a problem . 
   always horny where did you hear this ? 
  it 's not true . 
  our tv channels are full of naked women , though . 
   bad drivers a lot !, 
  just look at my flair . 
   ** but anyway , and this is going to sound really bad , pasta is n't really regarded as that much of a serious food around here . 
  i guess mostly because it has n't got a lot of tradition in portuguese cuisine . 
  no one actually makes it from scratch like some people in italy , it 's mostly a prepackaged food with relatively simple preparation ** . 
  it does show up in modern high-end cuisine but you would n't see pasta anywhere in a traditionally-minded restaurant . 
  ketchup on pasta is popular mostly among children anyway . 
  * heresy intensifies * / s we still luw you though :d, 
   and pasta you are heretic, 
  in the hot dogs , of course . 
  [ this is more representative of venetians than any of italy 's other regions , but the guy is known even in sardinia . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ccei77k6gm ), 
   donald trump making out with hillary clinton on live tv tomorrow now that 's quite an exaggeration . 
  berlin 2 . 
  paris ( it 's a beautiful city ) 3 . 
  barcellona ( it feels close to my culture ... sadly we have the same problems economically . ), 
  interesting question . 
  there may be a god , why not . 
  maybe one of the many interpretations of his wills is the right one , who knows . 
  tl ; dr : it could , maybe his will corresponds to the catholic/protestant/whatever interpretation , maybe it corresponds to no one of these . 
  yeah , but not if you live in zones where the youth unemployment is between 40-50 % ( or more ) . 
  i know that even sicily is better than 80 % of the world , but that 's not really consolatory . 
  well , we are still better than greece !, 
  what ? 
  it 's true . 
  why foreigners are even coming to you with the shitty economy you have ? 
  if you 're law-abiding , i 'm ok . 
  you want to be neutral this time too , uh ? 
  french and german . 
  i have only been to pavia for four times ( 2005 ; 2006 ; 2007 ; 2008 ) . 
  i was 3-4-5-6 at the time . 
  i wonder if dagestan has multilingual road signs . 
  maybe at the borders ( like friuli venezia giulia-slovenia ) , but i 'm not sure . 
  other than that , none . 
  it was a joke . 
  and anyway , i do n't think we really had attractive pms . 
  maybe goria https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/6/60/goria1.jpg , but he is n't very remembered . 
  nope . 
   carlos ii wtf has his face ? 
  i 'm heterosexual , mate . 
  and 99 % of our pms were old guys with wrinkles and shit . 
  the other 1 % is renzi , which is ugly as fuck . 
  are you female ? 
  no one . 
  we only had male pms , unfortunately -_-, 
  it 's quite hard , i do n't remember very well this part of history . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_unification here 's an article that could help you . 
  camillo benso , count of cavour and giuseppe garibaldi . 
  regno unito ( united kingdom ) , and in popular speach we use inghilterra ( england ) . 
   i really do not like how complaining is a national hobby we are on the same boat m8, 
  manga and anime fans . 
  i grew up myself with some japanese anime , but the fans are just too fucking annoying . 
  also , the catholic church , not because of the institution * per se * , but because of the shitty people that are in it . 
  the pope is a good guy though . 
  this year it seems very big thanks to gabbani . 
  hungarian erdogan , only without muslim fundamentalism . 
  also , he 's obsessed with soros . 
  * drugs are eviiiiiiiiiil !, 
  * cannabis is illegal , i do n't know about other drugs . 
  i live in sicily , and catania and palermo are the only big economic centre i know . 
  how hard is it to find a job , you ask ? 
  well , too fucking much !, 
  ops . 
  yeah , i forgot . 
  which is 300x better , by the way . 
  absolutely not . 
  i think it 's right to point out our errors , especially [ three ] ( http://www.wilditaly.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/giulio-andreotti.jpg ) [ of ] ( http://www.ilgiornale.it/sites/default/files/foto/2013/12/16/1387179689-craxi.jpg ) [ them ] ( http://www.ilrottamatore.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/riforme-berlusconi-assolto-lindro.jpg ) . 
  nope , the general attitude is * italy is literally third-world * . 
  this is common in all the country . 
  not even a little . 
  you 're absolutely right . 
  i live in sicily and i think up north it 's waaaaaaaay better . 
   german/italian ( nativ ) what ? 
  are you italian or german ? 
  and i 'm one of them . 
  i know that sometimes it could be exaggerated but this country can be a ** lot ** better than it is now . 
  seeing nothing change makes me hope us to get in the same league of greece and co. . maybe after that people will start to care . 
   romance languages are very forgettable triggered, 
   french native , i guess . 
  neapulitan and sicilian . 
  lol ok whoever wants to stay in italy is stupid . 
  i get it , you hate italy .
