  * the `` french '' president * or * the `` german '' chancellier * ) . 
  i wonder why , since if you 're born in italy and you speak italian you 're italian by logic reasonment . 
  they are , at least in the south . 
  same with italy , sadly . 
  no future here , i fear . 
  same with italy , except that youth are not depressed . 
  i read an article and our actual emigration is comparable to the ** post-wwii years ** . 
  it 's not the fault of the euro , israel or whatever . 
  those fuckers of craxi and berlusconi destroyed our ( italy ) country . 
  we ( as in , italian and greek people ) destroyed our beautiful countries . 
  i do n't want to be pessimistic , but italy could reach greece soon . 
  and if that 'll happen , i 'll be happy . 
  maybe after that our politicians will start to think reasonably before a 1789 revolution starts and takes them to being killed by the enraged masses , and the masses will start to care about real probelms other than soccer or food . 
  berlusconi is a ( much ) softer version of him . 
  tl ; dr : `` if they legalise gay marriage they 'll legalise marriages with dogs and everyone will be gay '' oh , come on . 
  internet use is among the lowest in europe . 
  uh , okay . 
  but i asked what makes us weaker as a society . 
  i agree with you though , autocorrection is a cancer . 
  * insert complain how about italy sucks shit *, 
   even non catholics are homophobic lol seriously ? 
  here in italy every homophobic politician is catholic ( or at least claims to be ) . 
  translation in barbaric : people , this guy is a troll . 
  lo spero anch ` io ( i hope it too ) . 
   please do n't think that all of us croats have the mentality that this person does . 
  replace `` croats '' and `` catholics '' and it 's the same . 
  i have nothing against both of you so no h8 m8 . 
   we wo n't be the shame of europe alone well , at least it 's coherent with the state of our economy . 
  i have nothing against religions , catholics and priests ( the good ones , of course ) , but i find people like giovanardi and bagnasco to be disgusting slime . 
  i 'm not an hardcore antiseparatist , it 's just that it feels old . 
  lucky you ... 
  * i hate mussolini and the part in italian was a joke . 
  * again , why the school being private should justify gener separation ? 
  i mean , they can cuz it 's private but i still do n't get it why it should be correct . 
  yeah , ok , but why should that allow gender separation ? 
  the 1950s in great yugoslavia are long gone , amico mio . 
  would you please explain yourself better ? 
  * your english is awful * why allowing it if the school is religious ? 
   well the thing is people are still not sure about homosexuality at least the experts are not , also today 's homosexuality is different then the one in the past on which many proponents of such behavior use in argumentation , sometimes it was pure pedophilia back then . 
  yeah , back then . 
  now it 's not . 
  sorry , pal . 
   by promoting or condoning such behavior we lose demographic potential which is badly needed in europe . 
  instead of saying `` blah blah blah blah gay marriages are bad because people wo n't do more babies '' , why do n't you just try to fix your economy as you 're one of the few countries in europe more fucked up than us ? 
   how many of gay 's are just insecure people that felt embodied by all the lgbt propaganda and have given up to a form of social pressure ? 
  what the fuck ...  and yes i 'm calling it propaganda since it constitutes of behavior of + -2 % of population in any country , but they get too much press and general spotlight . 
  here in italy , they are between 3 and 5 % . 
  sorry mate , you 're saying a lot of bullcrap . 
  andreotti was 94 years old when he died . 
  sgarbi is only 2 years younger than him and still alive . 
   is it wise to promote such behavior when europe is in demographic decline ? 
  oh no , not the `` if they legalize gay marriages no one will procreate anymore '' shit . 
  not here , please . 
  i thought that the few european catholics that frequented r/europe were more intelligent than some of their real-life counterparts . 
  translation for barbarians : but he will be called by god ( or satan , it depends ) one day too . 
  sadly he is only 57 years old , i do n't see that happening soon . 
  what ? 
  i 'm sorry what ? 
  and we still have n't . 
  germany did , malta did ... and we 're still here . 
  [ does he count ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/silvio_berlusconi_2001.jpg/182px-silvio_berlusconi_2001.jpg ) ? 
  the only thing i see is a phrase colored in red : `` sembra che qui non ci sia nulla '' , which in italian means `` it seems there 's nothing here '' . 
  dude , you linked ** this same thread ** . 
  help . 
  my mind is blowing . 
  i do n't think that explains everything . 
  more details pls , so i can understand better this story . 
  rule n \u00b0 1 : * whoever criticizes israel is antisemite , even is he/she is a jew himself * i 'm starting to think that maybe there are powerful pro-israeli lobbies ' infiltrations in europe . 
  not to the extent of italian judges being israeli mossad agents , but still ... or maybe i drank too much coffee this morning ( even though i 'm only 14 ) , whatever . 
   israel has been part of the same conservative strong man brigade as turkey 's erdogan and hungary 's orban for a while now , under netanyahu . 
  only that netanyahu has at least some sense is his head . 
  * plot twist *, 
  ot : wait a minute ... this is so similar to southern italy ... just remplace `` despots '' with `` politicians '' and `` elites '' with `` mafia '' and the picture is the same . 
  well ... sad . 
   trying to raise standards of living in africa is like tossing money into a fire pit and does n't actually solve the migration situation at all . 
  if they become richer they actually have better means and education to sneak into europe . 
  this is what you say . 
  now , if their living standards become higher , why they wo n't just live there and not migrate to europe ? 
  this guy is wrong . 
  it was spongebob behind the coup . 
  is it sarcasm or else ? 
  france pls . 
  erdogan , wtf ... could someone explain what the hell this guy has in this head ? 
  at least you 're doing something to save your country , contrary of us . 
   as you can see , many things got quite a price hike . 
  to be honest , it had nothing to do with the euro per se , it was just that shops and businesses got greedy . 
  same here , brothers . 
  same here . 
  if i think i 'll ever leave my country ( which becomes every day more possible ) , apart from food , the climate and friends absolutely nothing , because italy is crumbling and it 's unredeemable , especially the south . 
  i 'd prefer that rajoy would let them do their referendum , even though i 'd prefer them to stay into spain because we must be united . 
  ot : here in sicily there is an independentist movement , but luckily it 's very small . 
  well , seeing how things are right now for us ... * una tantum * , why not . 
  better for me . 
  the only problem that many people speculated on the change . 
  instead of 1936,27 lire = 1 euro , they did 1000 lire = 1 euro . 
  the same did n't apply for incomes , sadly . 
  we once were economically , but we spent our two economic booms ( the first in the 1960s , the second in the 1980s ) in clientelism and generous pension . 
  and so we are . 
  rampant unemployment ( especially south italy , which is not doing the same of greece only because it 's attached politically to the rest of italy ) , raise of popularity of eurosceptic parties and corruption .
