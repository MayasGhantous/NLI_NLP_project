  [ so many kisses ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/junckered-best-moments-commission-president-kisses/ ), 
  what is going on, 
  why did the uk hinder that ? 
  what did it gain ? 
  i think they have time to claim it until the end of january, 
  snow . 
  it stopped snowing even here in the north ( padan plain area ) . 
  i 've read somewhere that danes often offend different cultures without knowing it . 
  is it true ? 
  * [ you do n't use bidets ] *, 
  suspiciously easy, 
  that 's a hill, 
  ughhjhhhh i 'm so envious !!, 
  i forcefully ejected air from my nose after reading this comment . 
  i ca n't understand a single word my grandpa says . 
  pls include us, 
  russia has always been lagging behind in its ideologies, 
  in my experience , it seems like i can live a better life there with the same degree . 
  oh and i 'm not going to major in energy engineering, 
  it 's okay , i like the language !, 
  also i 'm already learning something with duolingo, 
  it would have made sense if the gif was from a famous movie/tv series, 
  same ... i 'm not even in uni but i 've already planned to move to germany after it, 
  i do n't get it , why did you have to link the gif ? 
  the universe aligned for this comment, 
  hello im italian and used google, 
  wait no stop i wanted to spam my friend 's facebook walls with pictures of my hypothetical twin daughters, 
  for once i decide not to read the news and this happens, 
  who does n't like sausages ? 
  maybe bias is involved , so that 's the reason behind these apparently absurd quotas, 
  two politicians from both sides came to my school and held a debate , explaining their views . 
  the whole reform turned out to be shady and the si supporter focused only on one ( good ) aspect of it . 
  so i guess it 's a no . 
  it 's just more realistic and founded that yours, 
  no but he is bekoming one like the rest of die e\u00dc lm\u00e4\u00f6, 
  i remember that everything was so inconvenient for non-owners of a car . 
  ~ ~ bribery ~ ~ lobbies are very powerful there , especially the automotive industry . 
  it was n't here in bergamo province, 
  wow, 
  our catastrophic economic and political situation, 
  and watch them being overtaken by german detective tv shows, 
  i was hoping for her to catch up and whoop his butt , but the thick humiliation he got from being recorded at his lowest is enough, 
  we could just use discrimination, 
  this !, 
  it keeps happening to me with a video from a discovery channel subsidiary, 
  i can almost taste the baltics ' nervous sweating, 
  thanks i needed that for my self esteem, 
  it has to do with europe because it provides a new perspective on the issue , many are the comments saying `` why ca n't they just go to lebanon or jordan '' but they do not know that the majority already goes there . 
  it 's informative on a very serious issue we are facing , so i think that other europeans should see this, 
  [ these ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/597ejf/which_countries_have_the_most_refugees/d967mdm/ ) are the sources ( bbc , amnesty international etc ) . 
  plus the video has been published by a discovery channel subsidiary , so it is save to say that the sources are credible, 
  sources taken from video descriprion : amnesty international : tackling the global refugee crisis : from shrinking to sharing responsibility https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol40/4905/2016/en/ bbc : the reverse exodus of pakistan 's afghan refugees http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37163857 the washington post : the e.u. 
  says turkey is safe for refugees . 
  here 's why it might not be . 
  ffs / u/chemicalpleasure ... 
  welcome in the eu, 
  it 's the best information, 
  idk come to italy, 
  ew it almost sounds like brescia, 
  i can not upvote this genung, 
  it costs viele money and maybe airports are n't that safe in a warzone, 
  sh it 's so much fun to hate ! ^ / s, 
  even the ones integrated into the society ? 
  it would be nice to have good rankings in anti-corruption and employment,

  department http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:life_expectancy_at_age_65,_2014_ ( years ) _ yb16.png, 
  great , if we could rank in the top in more important matters , that would be even more great, 
  men with big hips are sexy ? 
  wait you 're not andrei, 
  teens of / r/europe unite !, 
  people actually believe that ? 
  \u00c6yyyy lm\u00e5\u00f8, 
  well mcd 's food is perversion and blasphemy combined . 
  except for the chicken nuggets . 
  sh , not so loud !, 
  people are so out of touch with realty here ... 
  use the airports duh / s, 
  excuse me are you saying that gustaf ( < 3 < 3 < 3 < 3 < 3 < 3 < 3 ) is not hot ??? '' ???? '' ? 
  ... burger !, 
  haha, 
  in the easy readings section , the first two books are about the benefits/myths on ceta and ttip ... 
  psh we have [ norway ] ( http://www.tickld.com/x/marinemistake ), 
  figo, 
  i really wanted to visit warsaw ... 
  maybe if you do homogay it will scare them like russia, 
  what, 
  he should have been integrated ... why, 
  they funded a very nice path that goes between a river and a canal with the eu regional development fund . 
  it is very popular in the area now and much safer, 
  l-lewd !!, 
  this is culture appropriation . 
  \u00c4yyy lma\u00f6, 
  same with cars when they were invented . 
  slower and more expensive than horses, 
  come va ? 
  ( let 's see for how long we can conversate in each other 's mother languages-no google transalate ! ), 
  lmao, 
  why do n't you all say that you do n't want africans/muslims/different ethnicities instead of complaining that they do n't want to integrate ? 
  llmao . 
  literally laughing my ass off .
