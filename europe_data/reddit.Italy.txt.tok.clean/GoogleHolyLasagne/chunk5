  what are russia 's natural interests in annexing a poor country and facing a great number of economic sanctions ?

  thanks to a stubborn and idiotic commander, 
  wow what a great ass, 
  could you please source that ? 
  and what i wrote in my previous comment is from my experience here in italy, 
  they sort of nailed it with italy, 
  that view is quite extreme . 
  i can assure you that `` they '' do n't want you dead and the majority is not violent . 
  only the ones who fail to integrate and end up jobless and poor resort to violent actions , but that 's not a matter of culture , but of socio-economic status, 
  not the eurozone, 
  i literally ca n't roll my eyes more than this, 
  if they do n't , hundreds of human beings are very likely to die, 
  yea it would have been more rational to leave people die at your borders, 
  i think her priority is germany , not europe . 
  as far as i know , the eu is useful to her only to give germany more international power, 
  i 've always wondered what was life like in kazakhstan,

  i 'm an italian of ethiopian descent , and racism literally varies between provinces .

  i 'm not saying that there is none , i 'm currently a 5th year lyceum student , i know that there 's a butt load of it, 
  but i wonder if it is efficent, 
  *** it 's not a `` cake '' war it 's a matter of moral values and principles like how can you even imagine to like panettone it 's a moral abortion ***, 
  and litter it with canditi ?

  more like votes, 
  they 're actually very xenophobic towards non-saudis , even if they are muslims, 
  why, 
  at least help who you can or who is dying in front of your door note : i do n't agree with the `` ferry service '' , but when the crisis started the situation was different from now,

  amazing simplicity, 
  i 'm aroused . 
  oh good heavens . 
  hmm maybe i should have read more than the first two lines of the article, 
  well i 'm not against this kind of posts , but i remember seeing a couple of submissions i 've made removed for being local news , so i 'm ( somewhat ) curious to know why this submission got to stay . 
  probably because the motive of the crime is still unclear/peculiar or something like that . 
  whatever !, 
  is n't this local news ? 
  pandoro does n't have canditi, 
  in the north they are pretty safe,

  is n't cdu generally against gay marriage , being christian and blah blah blah ? 
  maybe she does n't want to risk the support of her own party, 
  i ca n't shake off the feeling that citizens will have less power on the gov if the reform passes , mainly for the fact that the parliament has to approve a referendum requested by citizens . 
  also , if i recall correctly , corriere della sera or la repubblica showed that they lied on the amount of money saved by cutting the number of senators . 
  also a couple of experts came to discuss this referendum at school and the no supporter stated that the cost of this referendum will take years to be paid with the money they claimed to save . ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ help, 
  you 're joking , right ? 
  how do we act against this ? 
  i think you misspelled k\u00f6nigsberg, 
  jjjjjjjjjjj, 
  the creation of these states ended up including nations historically in conflict with each other under the same government , causing conflict to escalate more quickly . 
  but you 're right , they eventually might have entered in another conflict , but the current one is caused by poor decisions made in the 20th century . 
  maybe i 've expressed myself poorly . 
  the union is a good tool of power for her on the continental and international level , this should imply her commitment to the eu,
