  the main factor is the creation of states ( by colonial powers ) with borders that do n't respect the ethnicities/cultures/whatevers living there . 
  this was also on of the main reasons of many wars in europe during the 18th/19th century, 
  yes that 's only logical . 
  i was n't going against that,

  oh finally someone who appreciates her, 
  what am i missing here, 
  well she is a strong * german * leader . 
  i think it 's quite obvious that she 's more interested in germany than the eu , the latter is only an instrument for her to further strengthen her country, 
  but that potato may be one of the best policymakers of this era, 
  well the majority of political unrest in those areas was caused by europeans soooooooooooooooooooooo ...

  how, 
  expect a finn to come with something along the lines of `` m\u00ef\u00e4\u00f6ettasakk\u00e4vittukokkat '',

  i like your thinking,

  people will shout `` violation of sovereignty '' if the eu tries to dictate greece 's fiscal policy . 
  i do n't mind some sort of eu formed provisional government to get rid of a very corrupt political class in a specific country ( eg greece or italy ) , but it seems very unlikely . 
  already posted, 
  the previous post was deleted for `` lacking credible a source . '', 
  i 've reposted it withthe article published by the hellenic broadcasting corporation . 
  the previous source ( in eng ) : https://libcom.org/news/greece-karypidis-supermarket-worker-commits-suicide-after-18-months-without-pay-09082017, 
  a more credible source : http://www.ert.gr/eidiseis/ellada/kinonia/sygklonizi-aftoktonia-ergazomenis-stis-epichirisis-karypidis/, 
  you could 've checked like i just did . 
  was n't he referring to their high average height ? 
  [ here ] ( http://www.ert.gr/eidiseis/ellada/kinonia/sygklonizi-aftoktonia-ergazomenis-stis-epichirisis-karypidis/ ) 's the article by ept , the main greek broadcasting agency, 
  not with adsl contracts here . 
  the latest contracts have fixed prices, 
  are ... are you even conscious of what you are typing, 
  here it egins with an innocent 25 $ / month and raises to 75 $ after a year, 
  it 's feking expensive tho, 
  hey ... you 're not alone in this thread . 
  we are being irrational , but at least because of emphaty . 
  i believe she can become a strong witness to drive off vulnerable kids from terroist ideologies, 
  i 've heard that dutch people love finns even more than finns love finns :0, 
  for a sec i thought it was a field of tulips ? 
  turkey asking the real questions, 
  paris and london are covered by clouds . 
  a comment above explained that large urban centers are more likely to be found on river deltas , explaining why all of padania and the nile are so bright . 
  i never said it is . 
  but you need to take into account how we are . 
  humans will always want better lives , and those who are strong enough to leave the social comfort of their motherlands will move to countries with better standards of living, 
  maybe we should push our governments to come up with a long term solution for this issue, 
  well yeah the situation in some parts of italy is quite hopeless, 
  it 's quite obvious that they are trying to run away from poverty,

  why should i find information to support your claims .

  care to elaborate ? 
  ah the introvert 's dream, 
  i suppose it 's an issue that may find an answer in psychology . 
  you ca n't possibly know their experience as turk-germans , because , allow me the assumption , you 're dutch and you are living in the netherlands . 
  i 'm using you as an example , but this can be applied to the general population . 
  one possible cause of this behaviour may lay in a confused identity , for they are born and raised in germany , but they are classified as turks by their native society . 
  some embrace their new identity , other resort to fanatic love towards the country of their ancestors . 
  it 's a sticky and icky issue . 
  bless you !, 
  * [ la teenage girl voice ] ( https://youtu.be/6cqm5ogo3tk?t=1m30s ) * heyyy i like your username, 
  each picture i see of the netherlands convinces me even more that it was the land where elves lived, 
  that 's a bit of a stretch ...

  it 's not like the government can forcibly control the crisis without committing some violations of human rights , you ca n't stop humans from looking a better standard of living . 
  it 's a similar situation to the one the us had with postwar european immigration . 
  but i agree that a tougher stance has to be adopted in order to deport the ones unwilling to be productive , even if it may be a small percentage edit : empathy guys ... 
  you ca n't really blame them tho . 
  who would n't move to a country that 's an order of magnitude better than yours ? 
  that 's what happened with postwar european emigration towards the us . 
  just humans trying to live better . 
  we just need to manage the situation better and take a hard stance towards those not willing to be productive towards society edit : oh well ... 
  or , read this in waluigi 's voice , erdo-waaaah, 
  oh god, 
  nonono not like that please, 
  also , died at tgv, 
  the latter would just stare him down, 
  it looks very similar to injera, 
  what is happening edit : nevermind ... 
  goodness after this thread i think we should establish a large empire again in order to spread the use of this basic element of modern civilization, 
  * glorying in italian *, 
  i second this, 
  could someone please explain it for us plebs, 
  next on turkish national news : `` the sun is arrested for gulenist ties '', 
  exactly ... a marshall plan for africa . 
  sure , some multinationals wo n't make the profits they are used to by exploiting the corrupt government and resource rich continent , but it 's the best solution in the long term . 
  i do n't care you can still snuggle shmuggle in blankets and drink hot milk , staying inside reading a book or binge watching a tv series . 
  paradaisu . 
  my existence invalidates your statement . 
  * crying * ... no, 
  it 's impossible !!!, 
  moslems want shakira law and can not integrate !!!!!! 1 ! 11 !! 1 ! 1 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  amsterdam probably beats it , but it 's definitely one of the best looking cities in the world, 
  which is a pity because it is a stunningly beautiful city , and i 'm not exaggerating, 
  scotland is missing,
