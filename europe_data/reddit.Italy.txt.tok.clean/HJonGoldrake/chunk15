   the greens have 1 mp , so yeah ... that 's not how it works . 
  labour lost several marginals * to the tories * which it could have won if it had recovered a portion of green votes . 
  the effect of re-drawing left-wing voters towards labour would be much larger than possibly taking their one seat from the greens . 
   anyway i am glad i am a salary man , honest freelancers in greece are pretty much presumed guilty of tax avoidance from the start . 
  the state assumes you tax-avoid , so it taxes you out of the wazoos , so you tax avoid , so the state assumes you tax-avoid it 's the same thing in italy . 
  businesses are saddled with lots of tax regulation , certificates and other stupid shit because the assumption is that there is a lot of tax avoidance and the system needs to be geared towards catching it rather than making it easy for honest people to live . 
  in turn , that means that especially small businesses who are starting out have a huge incentive to tax avoid , because their compliance costs are otherwise insane . 
   if you drink a bottle of wine a day , you 're a well cultured connoisseur . 
  i 'm guessing you are talking about places where wine was historically an upper-class drink . 
  in italy , a bottle-a-day drinker is most likely your grandpa , who did n't finish elementary school and could n't tell the difference between the finest vintage and a 5 $ bottle from the discount ( i had a grand-aunt exactly like this ) . 
  and there are definitely alcoholics who prefer wine , although we generally have a very small rate of alcohol abuse . 
  also useful for scale . 
  did we really put a seal with `` orgoglio italia '' ( italy pride , yeah it sounds wrong in italian too ) on our export prosciutto ? 
  that 's our milan expo logo too . 
  written romanian is pretty easy to read for us , but throw in your pronounciation and it becomes impossible . 
   just because a government changes it does n't mean it has the right to nominate all his cronies to every state job that exists . 
  do you have any evidence at all that varoufakis nominated or attempt to nominate unqualified but politically connected people to any post under his purview ? 
  banks lending money to a worthless debtor and having to be bailed out by the other countries in the same currency area as the debtor is `` socialism '' ? 
  you might want to brush up on your political economy . 
  from page 13 of the [ latest imf euro area policies report ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2015/cr15205.pdf ) :  high unemployment is likely to persist for some time . 
  looking at some key euro area countries , the natural rate of unemployment ( non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment or nairu ) is projected to remain higher than during the crisis in italy , and at the crisis level in france over the medium term ( weo database , april 2015 ) . 
  while the nairu is expected to decline significantly from unprecedented levels ** in spain , it would still remain above 15 percent ** over the medium term . 
  based on historical okun 's law relationships , staff estimates suggest that , without a significant pick-up in growth , ** it would take spain nearly 10 years , and portugal and italy nearly 20 years , to reduce the unemployment rate to pre-crisis levels ** ( see chart ) . 
   antifa has other targets , but use the same methods . 
  antifa set fire to defenseless people 's dwellings ? 
  where ? 
  some italiano regions also use * cacio * , which belongs to the same group as queso , cheese etc. 
  derived from the latin caseus , which meant `` cheese '' . 
   the sub of 4000 5000 subscribers singlehandedly bringing down the sub of 410k dubs . 
  sounds likely . 
  you posted [ this screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mv25jy9.png ) yourself . 
  anyone can judge by themselves whether it 's completely natural that a guy expressing mild criticism of / r/european is sitting at -15 or whether it 's more likely that you guys did that . 
   those creditors are private banks all over europe well , no , not for a long time . 
  the vaaaaast majority of greek debt is held by the troika , with a tiny sliver still in the hands of private investors . 
   please excuse and correct my american ignorance , but i thought that the eurozone admission rules included debt/gdp ( and other ) targets for continued membership , with countries who fail to meet a set of economic targets placed on `` probation '' with the possibility of expulsion should their economic standards continue to fall short . 
  well , that 's simply not correct . 
  there are ongoing committments to certain budget parameters , but the consequence for failing them is n't explusion ( and it 's not even clear what it actually is , because in practice countries end up presenting excuses and generally just get away with it ) . 
  so we have : - five wise men who preach sense to but remain unlistened by - an evil queen , who beggars the masses on the advice of - a crippled vizier , who not-so-secretly despises the poor and is opposed by - a dashing hero from the remote provinces , with the help of - a magician who returned from a foreign land & gt ; mfw 2015 europe is a fantasy setting, 
  as a regular of / r/antipozi :  nerds pissing you off ? 
  obama shitting up the country ? 
  israel demanding more american blood ? 
  you 've come to the right sub . 
  antipozi is a subreddit that is against cultural hiv/aids , particularly that found on reddit . 
  cultural hiv/aids ( `` poz '' ) is defined as anything that weakens a society 's ability to defend itself against cultural subversiveness . 
  how are you going to guarantee that / r/europe _ uncensored does n't turn into yet another far-right circlejerk like / r/european ? 
   why is this infantile `` ha gotcha ! '', 
  crap at the top of the thread ? 
  because you are reading it in the suggested sorting ( new ) and this was the youngest top-level comment in the thread when you read it . 
  silicon valley is great but it 's not a proxy for the whole economy . 
  more generally , it 's not an item of contention that growth in specific sectors can be fuelled by private investment rather than government spending . 
  but the issue in question here is whether private investment has ever successfully reversed the low demand at the root of an economic slump . 
  great , is there any example that is relevant to society after the industrial revolution ? 
   there 's more than one way to raise the level of investment in any economy , and getting the private sector to do it is definitely something that i 'd really like to see one historical example for . 
   i am sure some states have laws making it illegal no matter what . 
  there 's a supreme court ruling specifically on this question and nope , states ca n't make it straight up illegal ( of course they can restrict it so much that there 's no practical way to do it legally ) . 
   if police get a warrant in america then they take you to a hospital and have a nurse collect a blood sample , why would it be different in sweden without a warrant if they do not need one ? 
  i have no idea if they need one or not . 
  it 's possibe that they do n't need a warrant if you comply and might need a warrant \\ court order \\ other special instrument to actually force your compliance . 
  i have no idea ( i 've looked it up but not speaking swedish does n't help ) , but you ca n't just make this argument by assumption . 
   that is n't true . 
  there are plenty of laws the govern personal drug use in america , most notably public intoxication and under the influence laws . 
  so it is true : drug use is not an offense , but drug use in certain conditions is . 
  that 's unlike sweden , where drug use is an offense , period . 
   implied consent does not stop a person from not giving consent to a blood/urine test . 
  while in sweden they will physically force you to give a urine sample if you refuse to ? 
  where is the difference ? 
   but he could just refuse that and force them to get a warrant if they wanted to actually force him to comply and where is the difference with sweden again ? 
  will they punch you in the bladder no-warrants-needed ? 
   in america the police would need to get a warrant to have him do a urine test in america personal drug use is not an offense so they could n't get a warrant to test him regardless , it 's a moot point . 
  if he were found in the closest situation that does constitute an offense under american law , which is driving under the influence , they could totally have him do a chemical test ( blood or urine ) without a warrant , under implied consent laws which are in force in every state . 
   single quotes vs. double quotes . 
  apparently the difference is lost on you ... you could easily prove me wrong by quoting where i 've said something that could be paraphrased with your quotes , but you keep evading . 
  and you keep evading because you lied and you ca n't give an actual reply without admitting you lied . 
   i am not paranoid or delusional by any means ... see , i kinda have to doubt that , because you are obviously lying about something that anyone on reddit can immediately check , but you are utterly convinced you are right :  obviously i 'm making no headway here what headway are you hoping to make ? 
  what i 've written is there for everyone to read : nowhere did i say that snoop dogg was likely to be high because he 's black . 
  you ca n't just lie and hope that everyone is going to go along with it , that 's not how grown-up world works . 
   you assume he is high with literally zero proof other than ` he 's a black man who raps about smoking marijuana ' . 
   they think they have the right to act like bigots because they ` could n't possibly ' be racist . 
  do you suffer from paranoid delusions ? 
  neither of those `` quotes '' are anywhere in my post , but you seem very convinced that they are . 
  i must suggest you seek professional help if you have a pattern of reading things that are not there and other such things . 
   if that does n't make you a fucking bigot i do n't know what does . 
  i do n't know but at this point i expect you 'll come up with something all on your own . 
  what 's the name of this racist caricature you are arguing with ? 
  does he only show up on reddit or do you see or hear him elsewhere too ? 
  i see there are feelings of anger attached to this apparition , are there others as well ? 
  impotence ? 
   not for having smoked weed within a week yes , that 's why snoop was cleared , he had n't smooked anything within the last week . 
  it 's great the kind of arguments you can mount when you just assume shit is n't it ? 
   i doubt he was the one driving . 
  drug use is illegal in sweden even if you do n't drive . 
  retarded or not ( i sure think it 's retarded ) , the law is n't exactly a secret , you can read about it on wikipedia . 
   but if sweeds are ok with people getting pulled over and harrassed for no good reason other than `` maybe he was smoking '' than that 's fine by me , ** not my country ** . 
  except the majority of us states employ sobriety checkpoints too . 
  they literally pull random cars off the street to check if the driver 's high or drunk . 
   you can just randomly snatch people up for drug test in sweden ? 
  that is insane , that shit would never fly in america . 
  what 's insane is the amount of smug americans coming into this thread proudly proclaiming that ` murica has superior legal protections . 
  for your information , ` murica also has sobriety checkpoints . 
  i checked to see if you were a troll account but nope , unfortunately you are an actual person .
