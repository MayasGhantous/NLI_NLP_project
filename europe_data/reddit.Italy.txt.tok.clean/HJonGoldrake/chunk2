  the first article concerns a checkpoint , the second the ( violent ) attempt by the pkk to replace the turkish education system with a pkk-run one . 
  like i said [ in my reply to retarded_chicken ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jw7pc/14_soldiers_killed_in_pkks_landmine_attack_in/cusw5tt ) , these are the actions of an organization which intends to establish military and administrative control over a region , not merely inflict terror for a political or ideological reason . 
  describing these actions within the framework of `` terrorism '' fails to capture the essence of the events , which is a war by the pkk to establish an effectivly independent kurdish state in which the territory and public institutions are controlled by them . 
  both of the events cited ( two of your articles are about the same event ) concern a pkk checkpoint from which a car fled and was shot , killing one of the occupants . 
  establishing checkpoints across the country and controlling the identity and cargo of the drivers is the behaviour of an organization interested in establishing its control over an area . 
  it 's one of the most unambiguous acts of war . 
   pkk terrorists targeted turkish soldiers in a landmine attack late sunday in the town of da\u011fl\u0131ca of turkey 's eastern hakkari province , wounding and killing several soldiers , according to security sources . 
  does the `` terrorism '' framework make sense to describe a conflict where one party employs air strikes against the armed forces of the other , which replies by employing landmines against the armed forces of the first ? 
  this looks more like a war to me . 
  i frankly wonder how many people could tell it apart from sliced salami in a blind test . 
  i 'm not grossed out by blood-based foods in the first place , but i ca n't say black pudding even tastes weird . 
  survey time : are people in your country weirded out by horse meat ? 
  in italy it 's perfectly common , you 'll find it in any butcher 's or supermarket . 
  it 's a niche market , but few people shy away from it . 
  it weirds me out that `` horse steaks '' would be the disgusting \\ horrific dish from mainland italy , when we eat cow tongue which certainly must be weirder . 
  what is `` egregiously low quality '' about this post ? 
  the graphics are certainly high quality , the map is in high resolution , the source is clearly stated . 
  how does artwork by european artists commenting on european culture count as low quality ? 
  yeah , and it almost gains by being sung [ without music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnqdd02oagg ) . 
   nacionalsocialists were still socialist . 
  yes , and the democratic people 's republic of korea holds free and fair elections and puts the welfare of its people first . 
  an adjective being in the name of something do n't make it so . 
  i know , [ his light shines too bright for mortal eyes ] ( http://en.protothema.gr/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/varsaint.jpg ), 
   the pictures of italy and germany are both bombed cities [ i really had n't noticed ] ( http://cdn1.theodysseyonline.com/files/2015/06/28/635711292497697119473611858_tumblr_inline_nbc8y1rawo1qhgb5g.jpg )  but this is just poor and i thought that `` much boom , very growth , so economy '' was the perfect conclusion for a serious economics post , how silly of me . 
   i would just like to remove all non white people and muslims from europe . 
  this does n't make me a fascist . 
  no , but if your yarstick for decency is `` i 'm a massive racism but not * technically * a fascist '' i have bad news . 
   against universal suffrage because the bible says so ? 
  well that 's a new one . 
  what are they polling at ? 
   possible that in the later years of peace ( 1936-1939 ) , the rearmament costs accounted for up to 60 % of the state budget . 
  [ here 's the time series for rearmament ] ( http://i.imgur.com/559vkoe.png ) . 
   but not in the first years after the takeover . 
  until 1935 there was no conscription , the reichswehr was numerically approximately the same range as the bundeswehr today . 
  larger rearmament projects did not exist at that time . 
  so why did rearmament expenditure jump from 4.1 % of the government budget to 9.8 % the year the nazis took power , 1933 ? 
  to increase to 13.9 % in 1934 and 24.7 % in 1935 ? 
  but let 's hear from actual german academics on this subject : [ `` nazi policies deliberately crowded out private demand to ensure high rates of rearmament . 
  ** military spending dominated civilian work-creation already in 1934 . 
  ** investment in autobahn construction was minimal during the recovery and gained momentum only in 1936 when full employment was approaching . 
  '' ] ( http://www.researchgate.net/publication/222525781_deficit_spending_in_the_nazi_recovery_19331938_a_critical_reassessment ) do we need to go on ? 
  the nazi economic recovery was centered around enormously increased military spending . 
  it did contain elements of infrastructure investment , which came second to rearmament . 
   the economic boom in nazi germany hasnt really based on military industry . 
  [ `` between 1933 and 1939 , the total revenue was 62 billion marks , whereas expenditure \\ ( at times made up to 60 % by rearmament costs \\ ) exceeded 101 billion '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_nazi_germany ) i do n't know friend it looks to me like massive public expenditure in rearmament was the pillar of nazi economic policy . 
  and in fact , other sectors suffered from it : [ `` but whether this helped the average german is a matter of debate -- while more germans had jobs , a focus on rearmament meant rationing in food , clothing , metal , and wood for most citizens . 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_nazi_germany#pre-war_economy:_1933.e2.80.931939 ), 
  but it contains no jokes about potatos and poverty , how am i supposed to know what to comment ? 
   warsong [ `` that song of theirs is tremendous . 
  it 's a real weapon against the fascists . 
  it makes them go mad , i 'm being told , just to hear it .

   `` els segadors '' , or the reapers , the national hymn of catalonia . 
  not only does it have a badass title , it also has badass lyrics els segadors is the best national anthem in the world , especially because it loses nothing and almost gains from being sung [ without music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnqdd02oagg ) . 
   looks very staged impossible , those are clearly musicians who just happened to be walking through there with their instruments . 
  yes , what is european about a piece by a german composer whose theme is ancient greek mythology and is played in a spanish city ? 
  which does n't change the costs argument , or does it ? 
  yes , and the boom at the end of that healthy , sustainable recovery was quite prime too . 
   stop all immigration from `` incompatible '' cultures , like muslims or blacks . 
   `` incompatible '' cultures  like blacks i love it when the `` i do n't hate their race i hate their culture '' types slip up and openly confess that they are just racists . 
   i made some good money by advising regional governments in italy on how to cut bureaucracy , so i can tell you it can be quite expensive . 
  yes , by selectively including the costs of transitioning to a new legal regimen i too can prove that a bill is free , expensive or whatever i prefer . 
  but seriously , if we are going to include the costs of transitioning to a new system then the senate reform is likely to cost hundreds of millions . 
  a gigantic bureaucracy will have to change , new offices will have to be organized and staffed , powers and responsibilities wo n't magically vanish but will have to be taken over by other institutions . 
  the difference is that none of this will have any tangible economic effect , while cutting down the ridiculous amount of bureaucracy strangling the country most definitely will . 
  ah yes , the notorious costs of cutting bureaucracy . 
  countries have been ruined by that . 
   `` stagnation '' - lel . 
  especially right-wing ensures economic boom . 
  ah , the storied history of far-right economic booms in europe : [ nazi germany ] ( http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/images/30013309-p.jpg ) [ fascist italy ] ( http://www.theamericanmag.com/uploaded_images/article_2476_lc0naep5ku.jpg ) [ francoist spain and junta greece ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ardxhqw.png ) much boom , very growth , so economy . 
  let me see if i understand : this `` news '' is actually the testimony of a single romanian who says she has seen migrants dressed too nicely and with expensive smartphones ? 
  in what way does this sort of thing pass for `` news '' ? 
  it 's the biased opinion of a single individual who is most likely completely unable to tell apart designer clothes from cheap imitations and expensive smartphones from chinese knockoffs . 
  absolute shitpost . 
  yes , we can all see that in the rest of reddit us peer pressure prevents people from writing `` fuck '' and `` shit '' . 
   this is n't the us , this is the actual land of the free says he , posting on an american site . 
  whichever left-wing party has a chance of getting over the election threshold , so at this rate most likely the holy ghost . 
  my government should be focusing on making sure you do n't need 5 certificates costing 150 $ to legally do something for which the fine would otherwise be 15 $ . 
  that is an actual , real case . 
  another item of priority would be making sure that provinces with 250k inhabitants have more than two labour inspectors , so that illegal chinese workers ca n't be put to work 16 hour a day for a pittance in terrible conditions undercutting honest businesses . 
  that is another real case . 
  unfortunately it appears that the government 's chief concern is passing a constitutional reform to abolish our senate , which is a bit like making sure that the hinges on your bedroom door do n't squeak while the kitchen is on fire . 
  and here children we can find an example of the famous preemptive anti-rustling jimmy rustling . 
   what do the soldiers shout when they charge the enemy ? 
  we italians are lovers of classical culture , so we recognized early on that we could never top the ancient greeks . 
  those buggers [ had a whole goddess of battle cries , alala ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alala ) , whose entire concept is far too cool to defeat it with any other battle cry . 
  we do n't have an army battle cry but some of our units have [ sweet marching songs in demonic languages ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duufdnsokxk ) .

  just like a wretched claw-handed conservative to miss the humor in my excessively emphatic `` graphs ! '', 
   then again this is also the reason the oh so corrupt and self serving nd politicians arent in jail yet . 
  nope , nothing to do with that at all . 
  corruption is an actual crime on the books and ought to be there ; overblown electoral promises are not a crime and should n't be . 
   and then there 's the fact that syriza did n't managed to push greece into an economic meltdown in the hand-full of months it was in office `` economic meltdown '' : [ going from -0.2 % growth to +0.9 % in six months of rolling back austerity ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ao9w8id.png ) . 
  then , despite the incredible maelstorm of the debt negotiations , capital controls and all that jazz , ~ ~ [ greece is on track to be the top eu performer in q3 ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b1d24fde-6c0f-11e4-b1e6-00144feabdc0.html ) , growing its economy an expected 0.6 % of gdp ~ ~ my mistake , it 's actually [ 0.05 % ] ( http://ieconomics.com/greece-gdp-growth-rate-forecast ) . 
  still better than a recession . 
  man i wish we had some of that `` economic meltdown '' over here . 
   and what about varoufakis ' covert plan to force greece out of the euro the minister for economics with the best track record in the eu had a backup plan to take into the account the very real possibility of a grexit ? 
  if anything that 's commendable . 
   if greece ever wants to have a competent and honest goverment tsipras has to go to jail for his lies .
