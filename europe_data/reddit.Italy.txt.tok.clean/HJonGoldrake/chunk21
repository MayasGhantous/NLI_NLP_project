  greece 's recent experience demonstrates the importance of spreading the burden of adjustment across different strata of society in order to build support for a program . 
  the obstacles encountered in implementing reforms also illustrate the critical importance of ownership of a program , a lesson that is common to the findings of many previous epes . 
  other lessons drawn concern the need to find ways to streamline the troika process in the future and for fund staff to be more skeptical about official data during regular surveillance . 
  the detailed nature of the structural fiscal conditionality in the greek program also bears scrutiny given the premium attached to parsimony in fund conditionality . 
  ah , the foreign press commenting on italian internal affairs , how refreshingly reliable : you can always count on it to get mostly everything wrong . 
   and italy 's unelected government how does a british journalist not understand the concept of a parliamentary democracy ? 
  no italian government has ever been elected , they are all appointed by parliament . 
   has agreed to take them all blatantly false . 
   in october 2013 , italy 's previous unelected government , which like the current one was left-wing mmmh what ? 
  the past government was a coalition between the center-left , the centrists and the center-right ; this one is the same , but with a smaller center-right presence . 
   this hugely expensive operation -- ` mare nostrum ' it cost 9 million a month , 108 million a year . 
  the huge expense is what came after the people were ashore , not mare nostrum . 
   the same left-wing italian government also took the extraordinary step of decriminalising illegal immigration , which means among other things that none of the boat people are arrested once on dry land . 
  of course they did , because unlike the previous government they were not completely and utterly retarded in their immigration policy . 
  if you charge every immigrant with a crime you create tens of thousands of criminal charges , tens of thousands of trials and tens of thousands of possible appeals and senteces to be served . 
  the tribunals in sicily ( who had jurisdiction over the vast majority of these cases ) were absoutely swamped with them until this retarded law was repealed . 
   in the welcome centres , they are given free [ ... ] mobile phones congrats on falling for a hoax . 
  they are not given cellphones at all . 
   one of those arrested in connection with the islamic terrorist attack on the bardo national museum of tunis in march had crossed the mediterranean from libya to italy in a migrant boat in february . 
  we had one week of non-stop news about how this guy was misidentified and was actualy innocent , congrats once again on checking your sources . 
   the italian left has taken a hammering in the recent regional and city elections the center-left party has won in 5 out of 7 regional elections , that 's a hammering ? 
  plus , these last regional elections saw very little talk of handling boat immigrants ; they focused much more on local issues . 
   the italians call renzi ` il rottamatore ' ( the demolition man ) because of his vow to reform italy root and branch . 
  uh , no . 
  they called him `` rottamatore '' when he campaigned for party leadership on a platform of doing away with alla the dinosaurs ( i.e. 
  send them to the demolition yard ) . 
  and the name was applied to the entire group of junior party members who supported the same platform . 
   what ? 
  i think the answer here is `` i need to bring everything back to my unrelated personal battles because i ca n't recognize that there are other valid issues in the world '' . 
  there are tons of environmental regulations around industrial waste ( in this case we are talking about toxic chemicals like those contained in industrial oils and paint ) , which make getting rid of it fairly expensive . 
  various criminal organizations have set up a lucrative business model whereby they use legitimate and registered waste management companies to bid for contracts , undercutting the competition on prices ; they then transport the waste to territories they control and just dump it 7 meters under , which of course is immensely cheaper and nets them huge profits . 
  i wish . 
  the waste dump is filled with industrial refuse : oils , paint , pigments and other seriously nasty chemicals . 
  ferentari looks like old furniture and general shit , rosewater by comparison . 
  i 'm getting tired of replying in depth to your lazy one-liners . 
  this is the last time . 
  checking for purpose of stay and means of return is part of the external border procedure . 
  both france and germany have threatened to institute it on the internal border in response to immigrants arriving from italy . 
  they 've never done that , even when in 2011 we actually did issue 25000 residence permits to tunisian immigrants . 
  at worst , france blocked the trains at ventimiglia for a day , after which it was reminded that its decision was in violation of eu law . 
  internal border controls can be re-instituted for extraordinary causes and for limited amounts of time ; even if that were to be the actual reply , it could only last a very little while . 
   they wo n't close borders . 
  just reinstate border checks . 
  yes , i read you the first time . 
  like i said , `` border checks '' wo n't do anything unless they are discriminatory . 
  let me expand on why , since my first explanation was maybe too short . 
  periodically , the european union publishes an official list of documents valid for travel within the schengen area . 
  these are the sort of documents that you have to present at border checks , where present , for example when you fly between two european airports . 
  eu states are not allowed to pick and choose which documents they accept . 
  that 's because the whole point of schengen is to allow free travel under common rules . 
  among these documents are explicitly included the so-called humanitarian permits . 
  these temporary permits are issued to asylum applicants to legalize their status while their claims are processed . 
  and , like i said , they allow the holder to travel through schengen . 
  france can very well set up border checks , but it ca n't stop people based on the fact that they travel with a humanitarian permits . 
  it would be in violation of eu law and an obvious case of discrimination . 
  the only legal solution , in that case , would be to just close the border , which could only be done temporarily and if protracted would eventually be another violation of eu rules . 
   countries bordering italy will raise temporary border checks to stop refugees and problem wo n't go away . 
  so they are going to stop people based on the fact that they are brown and from the wrong country ? 
  i 'd like to see that happening . 
  once they have the appropriate permits they are free to travel through schengen . 
  france can close the border if it wants , but unless it wants to be sued by everyone and their mother for gross discrimination , it 's going to have to close it to * everyone * coming from the italian side . 
  somehow i doubt that 's going to happen . 
  our police has a quite a few more duty than imprisoning illegals and , as it turns out , we prioritize our own security over making sure that no immigrant incoveniences the french border patrol . 
  if any other country finds that effort insufficient they are welcome to send down their own police forces , at their expense , to lend a helping hand . 
  we 'd be thrilled to finally experience some of the famed european solidarity . 
   french interior minister bernard cazeneuve hit back at italy over responsibility for migrants on monday monsieur cazeneuve can start putting his money where his mouth is and help out . 
  he wants all the arrivals registered and housed in italy ? 
  he can send down his people to help . 
  frankly , fuck him . 
  we are handling the impossible here . 
  thousands of arrivals every week , all of which want to go to northern europe , all of which know full well the steps they need to take to do it . 
  picture this : a italian navy frigate with 900 rescued migrants on board , docking in palermo . 
  security and medical personel help them unboard , triage them on the wharf itself , send the many that need help to medical centers ( because that 's both the moral thing to do and our obligation under humanitarian law ) . 
  then the game of cat and mouse starts . 
  these people do n't want to stay here . 
  they know that they must n't have their prints taken , otherwise they get in the system and they will be expelled from any other country . 
  so they try to escape at any opportunity . 
  during transit . 
  during the first night of sleep , which is almost always in a makeshift immigration center because the proper ones are full to bursting . 
  these are people that have walked through deserts and embarked on dangerous sea trips , paying thousands , to get where they want . 
  they are not easily deterred . 
  so , if mr. cazeneuve wants them all registered and housed here , he can start helping out . 
  he can send down equipment and staff trained in how to properly register biometric data . 
  he can send down translators , medical personell , gendarmes , kitchen and cleaning staff . 
  and he can make sure that they are all available on a 24 hour rotation , because ships arrive at any hour of the day , many at night . 
  until he does that , he can shut the fuck up . 
  his neighbor 's house is on fire and he 's complaining that he 's getting an acrid smell in his living room , all the while refusing to pay to finance the fire department . 
  `` stop splitting hairs '' ? 
  you chose to intervene in a discussion about whether the italian mafia controls people smugglers . 
  you proved yourself wrong about it , do n't try to mask it by pretending to be annoyed that i 'm staying on topic . 
   if you read that report , you will see this whole thing is a racket if you read that report , you will see that it says literally exactly what i 've been saying from the start . 
  this is what i said :  they say that the mafia has its hands in public contracts for immigration centers , nothing to do with smuggling people in . 
  this is what your report says , right in the second paragraph that you quoted :  mafia capitale ** was not smuggling people ** , but once refugees arrived , it muscled in on the construction and management of the ** reception centers ** where the migrants were forced to live . 
  i managed to get behind the paywall and no , it does not say that the italia mafia now makes more money from immigrants than drugs . 
  what it says is :  but the prosecutors recorded buzzi saying to an associate : `` do you have any idea how much i make from the immigrants ? 
  even drugs are n't as profitable ! '' salvatore buzzi is not the italian mafia . 
  he 's not even a mafia boss . 
  the assertion that the italian mafia as a whole makes more money from intercepting funds destined to immigration centers than from the drug traffic is ridiculous . 
  buzzi did , but buzzi was a specialiast of this sort of thing , not a drug kingpin . 
  the italian mafia does not control the traffic of migrants into italy and does not make more money from them than from drugs .
