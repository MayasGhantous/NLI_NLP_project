  yes , if greeks ever want to have a competent and honest government they should start extrajudicially imprisoning former heads of government for offences that are not in their criminal code . 
  that notoriously leads to stable , incorruptible governments that know how to respect the law and the sacred principles that inspire it . 
   in republican polls trump leads , in democratic sanders will give clinton a headache . 
  populists on the rise it baffles me how someone could look at trump , then look at sanders and conclude that they are both simply populists . 
  trump is a mouthbreathing buffon with cartloads of chest-thumping slogans but literally only a single policy proposal to his name , that too forged from pure jingoism . 
  he is a dangerous populist , a potential berlusconi with far more executive power and the most powerful military in the world . 
  sanders is a mild-mannered moderate ( a center-leftist by european standards ) with a smattering of well-detailed and thouroughly cited initiatives , covering all major issues . 
  the man has graphs on his site . 
  [ graphs !,

  how has the euro as a currency funded education , healthcare and infrastructure ? 
   no , that does n't happen with the filters at worldnews at least . 
   it does if designed correctly the example mobile-friendly filters you linked do n't seem to work with relay , they just open a webview page of the reddit search screen . 
  i 'll try alienblue asap . 
   exactly the same as the previous megathread the difference with the previous megathread is that it was intended to be mod-updated , which proved unworkable with the amount of news coming out . 
   its an argument against wasting a lot of time an effort to `` contain '' discussion that is of interest to most people , has dominated the sub for a month and that will inevitably result in failure . 
  megathreads have been done successfully in the past , including for topics that dominated the frontpage for longer than a month . 
  there is no real argument to say that they can never work . 
   the filter idea is best imo , those who do n't want it do n't have to see it . 
  filters : - would leave the front page empty , because all other content will be interspersed a little for each 25-entries page - do n't work on mobile, 
  and all of that goes for any sort of moderation . 
  some people might always try and get around it . 
  that by itself is n't an argument against moderation though . 
   and it 'll implode like the previous `` similar idea '' difference is that with this version the mods do n't have to personally update it multiple times per day . 
  much more sustainable . 
   downvotes :( everyone in this thread is getting downvoted .

   pack your stuff , join dwb msf is a fairly selective organization , they do n't just take anyone . 
  currently , your best chances of joining are being a french-speaking medical professional ( especially in mental health , anesthesiology and nursing ) . 
  they are also looking , though less urgently , for french and arabic-speaking logisticians , which will generally be in charge of some project crew ( admin , infrastructure , it etc. ) . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/work-with-us ) is their recruitment page . 
  we should get a daily megathread , structured in a completely different way . 
  the frontpage of a subreddit is essentially a top ranking with a time decay factor to keep it fresh . 
  a megathread that were redone daily ( not deleting but rather unsticking the one from the previous day , so any ongoing discussion can continue ) would be a close approximation . 
  people could post their topics , there would be threaded top-ranked discussion of said topics , and the daily renewal would make it so that new topics could get attention . 
  to me , this seems an ideal solution to a frontpage that is regularly 14/25 immigration content . 
  it is news that needs to be discussed and it 's otherwise impossible to create a criterion for which topics deserve to stay up that wo n't cause massive controversy . 
  and by leaving it to users to post topics , there would be no requirements for mods to periodically update the thread , which is an unworkable system . 
  automoderator could simply unsticky the old one and put up a fresh thread at something like 4.00 am every day , while most users sleep . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : i 'd like to see a daily megathread functioning as a parallel frontpage in times of sustained frontpage domination by a single topic . 
  automated and user-curated , it would provide all the space needed for discussion of that superhot event while giving breathing room to other news and topics . 
  that happens here too , and merchants say that credit card transaction fees are too high for low payments . 
  the gubernment is actually doing something and will impose price controls on the transactions to gradually bring them down over the next few years .

  i love that nazis launch over 200 attacks against the refugees and the reaction of the larger german public is : - put up giant signs in every stadium saying `` refugees welcome ! '', 
  - engage in an overwhelming outpouring of charity - send an anti-nazi song to the top of the charts edit : [ metal in german is fucking terrifying ] ( https://open.spotify.com/track/4qh0sqajplpwswvygk1ysu ) edit2 : ahah these are the lyrics for the first stanza and chorus :  you are really dumb ,  which is why you 're doing so well . 
   hate is your attitude ,  your blood boils constantly . 
   everything needs to be explained to you  because you really do n't know anything ,  most likely not even what attitude means !,

  summary : - an ivorian man , arrested for the double murder of a retired couple in palagonia , sicily , has also been charged with sexual assault after the autopsy determined `` with certainty '' that the woman had been raped . 
  - the prosecutor believes that the large amount of evidence available will make for an open-and-shut case . 
  - the man was found in possession of items stolen from the couple 's house ; a ring , belonging to the man and appearing in earlier photographs , has been found at the house . 
  - the investigators now suspect that italian accomplices , who might have pointed the man towards the valuables in the house , might also have partecipated in the assault since crime scene evidence appears to indicate multiple perpetrators ( further details [ here ] ( http://video.ilsole24ore.com/tmnews/2015/20150904_video_14271867/00035048-omicidio-palagonia-forse-kamara-ha-avuto-complici-italiani.php ) ), 
  based on [ this ] ( http://www.corriere.it/cronache/15_agosto_25/turista-americana-violentata-sorrento-selfie-aggressori-su-facebook-772aae14-4aec-11e5-9f12-8a25e5d314d3.shtml ) more comprehensive report , it appears that the woman was first cornered in a bathroom and raped by one of the men ; after she escaped and found her friends , she returned to the bathroom to straighten her clothes and wash up before leaving . 
  there she was assaulted a second time , by both men . 
  the aggressors are currently under arrest thanks to security footage which enabled the investigators to identify them quickly . 
   it 's basically just tits and beer . 
  and pork . 
  there are already 3.6 million muslims in germany , so i guess they 'll react about the same way as they have all these years , which is n't very much at all . 
  i do n't get genocidal urges from crime stories . 
  neither do any of my friends . 
  neither do neo-nazis , when the criminals are white . 
  strange innit ? 
   there are no big problems or strong opposition . 
  there are , in the sense that the catholics remain an indispensable element of any majority , and bipartisan politics are currently impossible on anything meaningful . 
  thank you for the gibs but this wo n't make me forget 9/11, 
  nice attempt at sidestepping , but tell me : do you think breitbart 's conduct is acceptable ? 
  do you think it is a better example of journalistic integrity than the bbc ? 
   i was banned from here for posting a breitbart article . 
  ca n't see why that might be a problem , after all breitbart is only famous for [ literally faking videos to destroy a public program they disliked ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breitbart_ ( website \\ ) #acorn _ undercover_videos ) , [ heavily cutting a video to smear a usda official ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breitbart_ ( website \\ ) #shirley _ sherrod ) , [ publishing the dick pics of a politician they disliked ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breitbart_ ( website \\ ) #anthony _ weiner ) , [ faking a story to connect a secretary of defense candidate to a terrorist group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breitbart_ ( website \\ ) # .22 friends_of_hamas .22 _ story ) and [ misidentifying an attorney general nominee to connect her to the lewinsky scandal and printing a retraction that did n't actually retract anything ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breitbart_ ( website \\ ) \\ #misidentification _ of_loretta_lynch ) . 
  that sounds like the high-quality journalism that we should encourage on / r/europe , and speaks highly to your commitment to journalistic integrity and the pursuit of unbiased media . 
   despite the bbc painting her as a refugee where ? 
  the only time the time the word refugee is used in reference to her is literally the last line of the article , and it 's a quote of what she said , not the bbc 's opinion : nour was finally able to declare herself to the country of her choice . 
  she wanted to get the opening words of her asylum plea exactly right . 
  her brother sent her the text of what she should say to the police . 
  she repeated those words again and again to herself as she walked towards the nearest police station . 
  she pressed the intercom and went inside . 
  `` hello , i am a syrian ** refugee ** . 
  i would like to apply for asylum in sweden . '', 
  are you seriously citing an openly right-wing think-tank founded by margaret thatcher and headed by lord saatchi , the former chairman of the conservative party , as an objective source on bcc pro-left bias ? 
   the guy who cut the video suggests the bbc had the same footage who is this guy and where does he suggest that ? 
   or were even close enough to the incident as sky 's team which does n't mean that they were filming the previously unremarkable couple those five seconds during which the man picked up her wife and kid and threw himself and them on the tracks . 
   hell , they still think the bbc knew about wtc7 collapsing are you seriously trying to bring 9/11 conspiracy theories into this as an actual argument ? 
   it 's the nature of the modern media age that developing stories are often wrong : everyone tries to be the first to break the news . 
  wait , so was all of the above sarcasm ? 
  do n't play with me like this man :(, 
   no comedy value for the last statement . 
  so you actually meant it . 
  you wrote `` according to you , they did n't make a mistake '' when actually slyratchet wrote that they have made a mistake , right here : [ the bbc is fantastic and its by far the best there is . 
  tthere 've been mistakes in the past and there will be mistakes in the future , but it will continue being fantastic because the mistakes are so few and far between . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3jimgg/bbc_lying_about_hungarian_police_as_an_immigrant/cupmlp2 ) explain to me how this is ok while the bcc 's mistake is `` blatant lying '' . 
   the bbc did not lie when they most blatantly have the only way to believe that this is an example of blatant lying is to already be primed to find blatant lying . 
  you have literally no evidence of any intent to deceive the public , and you do n't even know whether a full and correct report of the event ( or footage of it ) was available to the bbc reporter when he recorded that piece . 
   he was trying to make it look like the police hurt him nope , he was making a theatrical display and shouting that he was n't going to move from there ( because the police was trying to get the migrants out of the station ) . 
  he was n't shouting anything remotely like `` they hurt me '' . 
  this shitpost should be removed . 
  it contains an unsubstantiated statement produced by stitching together footage to give the impression of information ( which is that the bbc deliberately lied ) when that information is not present in the footage in question . 
  it was sarcasm . 
  maybe `` everything the bbc says is the truth '' was sarcasm , but please enlighten me on the comedy value of `` according to you , they did n't make a mistake '' .
