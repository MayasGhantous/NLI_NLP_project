  there 's no incentive for a private company to invest in infrastructure when their customers have no choice . 
   traditional allies , like trade unions , are furious about labor market changes that they say favor business . 
  to be completely clear : he had promised to introduce a new type of employment contract to replace the myriad of temporary work contracts which , starting from the mid-90s , had essentially eliminated the possibility of job security for a large segment of the population ; the trade would be that employees under the new contract could be fired at-will , but would be paid a severance increasing with the seniority . 
  he also promised to pair this with new strong unemployment benefits and a functioning work placement and re-training program . 
  what actually happened was that all the old contracts were left in place , and the old standard work contract saw its job security protections eliminated and replaced with a severance of 1 month of pay for every year of seniority . 
  unemployment benefits were reshuffled but left essentially unchanged , and no work placement or re-training program has even been mentioned . 
  summarizing that as `` benefiting business '' is a bit misleading . 
  `` breaking promises '' and `` eliminating labour protections with no upsides '' is a more apt description . 
   `` he is destroying all the checks and balances , '' said renato brunetta , a lawmaker in italy 's lower house of parliament with the opposition party forza italia . 
  for full disclousure : forza italia was onboard with renzi and his reform program , including `` destroying all the checks and balances '' , until renzi outmaneuvered and humiliated berlusconi during the presidential elections . 
  brunetta 's criticism is about as sincere as a car salesman at the end of the month . 
   `` there is a huge conflict between generations , '' said tommaso giuntella , 30 , president of the democratic party 's branch in rome . 
  `` renzi knows it and started being the face of the new generation , the generation of the sons . 
  he said , ` we can not permit the son to pay for the privileges of the father . ' '' given that renzi 's labour reforms leave existing contracts as they are ( with full labour protections and benefits intact ) , while new contracts have much lower labour protections and far more uncertain benefits , i 'd say that he 's precisely making the sons pay for the privileges of the fathers . 
   he clashed sharply with the public employee unions here the nyt is simply wrong . 
  renzi 's jobs act does not involve public sector workers , his clash was with private sector unions . 
  actually , the two living popes are in the vatican . 
  true , true . 
  we also have the largest amount of enclaved states in the world . 
  food is just about the one thing we have down tight , do n't diss :( [ ] ( / gnu terry pratchett ), 
  we have many words for * types * of pasta ( penne , maccheroni , farfalle , bucatini , rigatoni , semolina , trofie , garganelli , gramigna , tortellini , tortelloni ... ) , but the type of food is [ just pasta ] ( http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/pasta_ ( sinonimi-e-contrari ) ) . 
  i just checked and apparently [ italian has only 1 word for potato ] ( http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/patata_%28sinonimi-e-contrari%29/ ) : patata . 
  with nearly 300k subscribers even this thread is n't a significant sample of the popultion ( given that it has 400 comments but most of those by the same few users ) , and having observed that angry people usually are more vocal than happy ones , i 'm not sure we are exactly in the majority , silent or no :d, 
  if that 's meant to imply that stalin must naturally have given the order to start the greek civil war , it 's wrong . 
  stalin was actually opposed to it , as he had basically renounced greece as a possible communist country ; in [ his view ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_civil_war#end_of_the_war:_1949 ) , the western allies would simply never give up the country because of its strategic location . 
  my question to op was purely rhetoric , because the statement that stalin of all people `` unleashed '' the greek civil war is a gross falsehood that 's immediately disproven by even the most cursory investigation . 
   `` stalin unleashed the greek civil war '' this is such a stupid statement , and op has done nothing but try to deflect criticism of it . 
  the greek civil war essentially stemmed from the repression of greek communists which were [ massively prosecuted ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_terror_ ( greece ) ) by the greek right-wing government . 
  the 1946 elections were an undemocratic affair held with large numbers of greek communists imprisoned or forced into hiding by legal and extra-legal means , and were massively boycotted by the greek population : of [ 7.5 million greeks ] ( http://www.populstat.info/europe/greecec.htm ) in 1946 , only [ 1.2 million cast their vote ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_legislative_election,_1946 ) . 
  and , by the way , [ stalin was opposed to the war 's continuation and urged the greek communists to fold it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_civil_war#end_of_the_war:_1949 ) , because he believed the western allies would never give up greece . 
   sources to debunk his stupid remark is easily verifiable with the most basic wwii/cold war history textbooks . 
  that the greek civil war was `` unleashed '' by stalin is easily verifiable from the most basic cold war history textbooks ? 
  cite me one that say it . 
  you are not the only one . 
  i think these rules are awesome . 
  true , but at the same time britain has often been an only voice of sane criticism to a european project that pushed ahead without much regard for risks and consequences . 
  assuming that the european project is inevitable and invincible is one of the worst mistakes we could make . 
  right now , the eu exists as one thing only : a regulator for a continental common market . 
  its role in every other arena has been decisively shown to be cerimonial at best . 
  we have to decide whether we like it like that , and in such a case reshape european institutions accordingly , or if we want to continue with the project of political unity that was initially intended . 
  you ca n't have an institution that is just a market regulator in charge of vetting national budgets , for example . 
  it either has to have real fiscal authority ( and the democratic legitimacy to exercise it ) , or it has to devolve that back to the states . 
  the same with every other area . 
   the reason for this growth is that people , businesses and governments are borrowing beyond their means again . 
  any solid data showing that overleveraging of the economy is happening and is at the basis of current growth ? 
   when shit hits the fan he 's gon na close that border yes , this is inevitable . 
  especially with fpo gaining ground , it 's a logical reaction for your government to scramble and try to show toughness on immigration . 
  however , i think you 're making a mistake in imagining the situation at the brenner will become similar to your south-eastern border . 
  immigrants travelling north across italy are not like the human river that crossed the balkans ; they arrive in small groups on boats , are taken by our police , wait a considerable period to be able to leave sicily , and then take trains and busses north . 
  there they try various routes , not only into austria but also into france and across switzerland . 
  if precedent is any teacher , you 'll be met with a steady trickle more than wave upon wave . 
  no , it 's about whether the gas and oil wells curretly operating within 12 nautical miles can operate till the end of their concession or until the well is dry . 
  even if the referendum passed , they would n't be immediately closed down ; some have concessions ending in 2034 and they would keep operating until then . 
  gladly . 
  the amount of money they siphon off is staggering , if austria wants them we 'd be well rid of them . 
  nobody will help this time either , they 'll just close the alpine borders if they become a nuisance . 
  just about anything south of french-spanish border feels like the same country with slightly different languages . 
  the gauls had had a pretty good run , invading roman territory repeatedly and sacking rome itself . 
  the romans were so embarassed of the latter event that they concocted a story in which , rather than being forced to pay a hefty ransom by the gauls , they were saved by the timely arrival of heroic general marcus furius camillus who expelled the gauls from rome and exterminated them utterly in a battle outside the city , yelling `` not with gold but with iron is the fatherland rescued ! '', 
  the romans * literally * invented paying the iron price before grrm , and it was all thanks to the gauls . 
   also yesterday gentiloni reiterated that italy is ready to coordinate operations for the security and stability of libya , but only after a clear request by the new libyan government . 
  this is the most important line in the article . 
  italy wants an intervention in libya to end the civil war , restore significant economic ties and regain control of migration through the country . 
  it seems that our government has adopted the rather sensible strategy of ensuring there is a viable coalition government , composed of the most of the ameanable factions in libya , * before * we get engaged militarily . 
  the true test of this plan is whether this government will be able to build and retain the loyalty of a capable , united military that can autonomously and effectively ensure the security of libya against islamist militias and secessionist attempts . 
   we 're well above using violence as a first-resort political tool we had one of the longest and bloodiest periods of domestic political terrorism in european history only a few decades ago . 
   by the mechanism of insolvency , in other words declaring bankruptcy , and postponing debt payments/refinancing . 
  greece was running a ( very ) large ** primary ** deficit . 
  that means excluding debt servicing . 
  they could have stopped debt payments and they still would have been short ** a lot ** of money . 
  also , running your country without credit is n't as easy as saying ` well i just wo n't borrow then ' . 
  tax revenues ( and other incomes which make up a minority of total revenue ) are not constant throughout the year , neither are expenses , and it 's very rare that the two are in convenient synchronicity . 
  if you do n't have credit you almost certainly have to resort to deferring payments of either welfare entitlements , salaries or purchases in an irregular fashion over the year . 
  that 's a recipe for massive economic turmoil , given how large a share of gdp modern public sectors constitute . 
  there 's a reason why public finances are run the way they are , why even countries with fiscal surpluses do n't just do without credit , and why countries that end up cut off from financial markets have huge problems for it . 
  ` then just do n't do it ' is n't the simple solution that a few smart redditors think it is . 
   by your point of view the debt sustainability of italy would collapse . 
  ... what the fuck are you even talking about . 
  this is n't even wrong , it simply does n't make sense . 
  this thread is ground zero for financial illiteracy . 
  people are spouting absolute nonsense like this and getting upvoted . 
  fuck it , i 'm out of here . 
  by the way , the italian state does own shares in several companies which it could sell off . 
  they do n't cover a meaningful percentage of the debt . 
  next up ... real estate owned by public institutions ? 
  good luck liquidating that during or facing a default . 
  then you 're left with the large majority of the national wealth which is privately held . 
  would you like to confiscate and liquidate a portion of that ? 
  sounds like a great recipe for a massive recession , even assuming you could start and complete the process within your next payment deadline which you most certainly could n't . 
  fuck it , it 's not worth it to have a discussion like this . 
   of course , it would n't . 
  i 'm just saying that greece would have let default . 
  they could have defaulted regardless . 
  in fact , defaulting when your debt is externally held is better , you are not screwing over your own people and companies . 
  if it was n't clear , i was asking rhetorical questions . 
  whether the debt is externally or internally held does n't matter . 
  if you can no longer borrow on the open market , and you do n't want to default , you are at the mercy of whoever is willing to extend you emergency credit . 
  italy would be in the exact same position as greece should it come to that . 
   are you implying that anyone would have n't been allowed to buy greeks bonds or just that in 2009 100 % of the debt was held inside the country ? 
  the expression `` say that ... '' means `` suppose for the sake of argument that ... ''  greece could have cut the debt or delay the payment if noone inside or outside the country would have bough some bonds .
