  and that would have magically materialized the money to pay for greek pensions and public workers salaries how ? 
   why everyone is obsessed with debt / gdp ratio and totally ignore the assets a country own and the national wealth ? 
  because we would hopefully not want to start selling off the nation 's wealth to repay creditors . 
  how is that a hard concept to understand ? 
  if you have a loan you want to be able to repay it from your income , not by selling off your jewelry . 
   it helps because no foreign country can blackmail the government interesting line of thinking . 
  explain it to me . 
  say greece did n't owe a cent to foreign banks and instead had 100 % domestic debt . 
  in 2009 it emerges that it has been cooking the books , that the debt is larger than previously known and that the deficit is much larger than previously known . 
  consequently , greece 's credit rating tanks to junk status and nobody wants to buy its new bonds even at extremely high interest . 
  by what mechanism does greece no longer need emergency credit from european partners in this scenario ? 
   but italy has a low share of public debt held by non-residents how does that help ? 
   and the country 's national wealth is four times larger than its public debt that 's not very good news i 'm afraid . 
  if you had 400.000 $ in assets ( say , a 350.000 $ house and 50.000 $ in the bank ) would you feel fine with being 100.000 $ in debt , with the debt growing 3 % every year while your income only grows .7 % ? 
  anyone can look up indicators , it 's the predictions that are juicy and this guy is making them based on nothing . 
  he has no model whatsoever , he just comes up with the number `` this year or the next '' with no explanation . 
  in reality the situation is more complex than that . 
  italy is the fourth largest economy in europe and its debt stock is immense and nicely spread around , so that if it were to default it would fuck over not just itself but france and germany too in the first instance . 
  that 's a situation everyone wants to avoid and there 's no telling ( unless you have a model ) how the chips are going to fall when the italian pm , the german chancellor and the french president have to look at the potential for a massive recession in europe and bankruptcies across half the financial sector . 
   and they have good border protection . 
  that 's it really . 
  morocco does n't want to be a transit country for migrants en route to spain and has the ability to enforce that . 
  consequently , both individuals and smuggling networks pursue the much more open route through libya into italy . 
  ** translation ** `` italy simply needs to find itself again '' said matteo renzi during a visit to the national nuclear physics institute gran sasso laboratory . 
  `` there 's a tale according to which italy is only ever in crisis , with great praise for those who leave since in italy there are n't any institutions which are up to standards . 
  i say it 's ok to go abroad , but it 's manichean to state that all is well abroad e nothing is in italy '' the prime minister explained talking directly to the researchers : `` if you want to leave do it , in the past we had our fill of prime ministers who said do n't go . 
  if you think it 's best , do it . 
  but we will make our institutes among the best in the world , we will make of italy a nation that will attract researchers from italy and the whole world . '', 
  renzi urged : `` we need a pact , we must stop talking of italy only in the negative and at the same time politics must do more and better . 
  it 's a charge we can assume together . '', 
  the labour reform changed the way perm contracts work . 
  it used to be the case that you could not be fired without cause ( like negligence , or the company shutting down or eliminating your position entirely ) . 
  now you can be fired at will , but if you are not fired for cause you have a right to up to 2 months of severance pay per year of seniority ( getting the maximum payout requires filing with the labour court ; the default is otherwise up to 1 month per year ) . 
  the constitutional reform turns the senate from a directly elected national legislative body to an indirectly elected national consultative body , de-facto abolishing it as a legislative house . 
  the electoral law reform changes the way the chamber of deputies , the remaining and now unicameral legislature , is elected . 
  we have a proportional system with a majority rule and an optional second round . 
  in the first round all parties compete ; if one party receives over 40 % of the vote , they win and get 54 % of the seats , with the rest divided proportionally among all other parties getting more than 3 % . 
  if no party gets 40 % , a second round is held between the two most voted ; the winner gets the 54 % of the seats like before . 
   how is the economy now ? 
  recovering at a glacial pace . 
  [ current estimates ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu/countries/italy_en.htm ) are gdp up 1.6 % and unemployment down 0.4 percentage points to 11.8 % . 
  we are still far from [ recovering what we lost in 2008 and 2011 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tjrauna.png ) . 
   what is happening with the problems with the banking sector ? 
  negotiations are ongoing between our government and the ec on what kind of rescue is going to be considered legitimate . 
  our government wants a measure of state intervention to cushion the fall for exposed investors , many of whom are upper-middle class people who put their savings in bank bonds ; brussels has so far been opposed to the idea . 
   how is renzi doing after 2 years in office ? 
  and what came of his much-vaunted reforms ? 
  renzi has managed to navigate every crisis with uncanny political acumen , even though he has bled in the polls somewhat . 
  he passed his labour reform , his electoral law reform and is on track to passing his constitutional reform , which will turn italy into a de-facto unicameral state . 
  he is now fighting stiff opposition to a civil unions proposal that would , for the first time , give recognition to same-sex couples . 
   what is happening with the migrants ? 
  we are purposefully dragging our feet with completing the migration hotspots , as we have no confidence that the promised european redistribution system will become a reality ( a suspicion that seems to be confirmed by the extremely slow progress of the already-enacted 160 000 refugees redistribution plan , which has so far transferred less than 300 people ) . 
  migrants are still crossing , most being rescued but many still dying at sea . 
   also curious about italian foreign policy our current foreign policy focuses on three areas : international trade deals especially with emerging markets , eu-level negotiations to advance italy 's interests in the areas of migration and economic policy , and multi-polar negotiations to stabilize our north african neighborhood as far as possible . 
  we are seeing some encouraging signs on all three fronts , but we are still far from achieving inpactful results . 
   italy blocked it . 
  italy is willing to pay its part tomorrow , so long as the commission agrees that it should n't be counted within the regular budget deficit restrictions . 
  we simply do n't want to face eu-level penalties for breaching budget limits when other eu countries have already received the same exception for their own migration-related extra expenses . 
  it does n't sound crazy to me . 
  posting this in every thread since the alarmism is starting : #there is severe media sensationalism over what this virus is and does - zika is a virus normally transmitted by mosquito bites . 
  it can also be transmitted sexually , or via the placenta from mother to child . 
  the latter two avenues of transmission are poorly understood at present due to the very low number of known cases . 
  - [ the range of the species of mosquito carrying this virus covers the tropical areas of the world and other non-tropical compatible climates . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zika_virus#/media/file:global_aedes_aegypti_distribution.gif ) so far , the mosquito has n't reached europe , and the only infected europeans were bitten while travelling . 
  - about 1 in 5 people who are infected with the zika virus will develop fever-like symptoms known as zika fever , consisting of a mixuture of rash , fever , joint pain and conjunctivitis . 
  they last up to a week , and do n't require special treatment in otherwise healthy individuals . 
  - there are unconfirmed suspicions that the zika virus might be responsible for some cases of congenitial malformation . 
  this is because zika has been isolated in tissue samples taken from foetuses who have been aborted or miscarried due to malformations and from other poor pregnancy outcomes . 
  ** a casual relationship , if present , is yet to be established ** , but out of an abundance of caution health authorities are releasing travel advisories for the territories within the range of the zika-carrying mosquito , while increasing resources to study potential cases and provided the necessary care .

  you simply misread the sentence , cutting it in a weird way . 
  the `` fault '' part does n't refer to the economic situation , it refers to greece 's geographical location . 
  the way a bad bank works ( italy 's would not be the first by a long shot ) is that it focuses on maximizing the value of its stock of bad debt , mostly by going through the process of seizing collateral or selling the securities . 
  meanwhile , the good back works hard to restructure its operations and make sure it can function at market conditions with the efficiency and effectiveness it lacked . 
  what happens to the shareholders depends on the exact details of the deal . 
  the most likely scenario is that to meet the capital requirements of both banks they 'll have to take a hit , but all analysts i 'm reading keep repeating that we wo n't know how much until the details are known . 
  it makes me feel old that there are people who do n't remember * giochi senza frontiere * . 
  it was [ absolutely ridiculous ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuwpqbrfewy ) in every regard , and a lot of fun . 
  i was a teenager when they stopped showing it , i remember being quite bummed . 
  the investors are supposed to be the ones left holding the bag , they are the ones who make the profits when things go well . 
  we ca n't have a system where investors make money in the good times and the public foots the bill in the bad times . 
  the current italian proposal would still put the onus entirely on the private investors , as it should ; it would simply allow them a reprieve from having to mark down to rubbish values which are non-reflective of the actual values of the underperforming loans . 
  maybe an example will help clarify . 
  suppose a company manufacturing tiles took out a 50 million business loan in 2013 , but the bad economy and some new competitor put it out of business and it ca n't repay . 
  that loan is considered unperforming , i.e. 
  it 's not going to be repaid . 
  still , it has collateral : the company has some cash , a stock of tiles that can still be sold , clay and pigments and additives , and its factory and machinery have considerable value . 
  if that loan were sold now , when the markets are panicking , it would have to be sold at a rubbish price , completely irreflective of its actual value ; which is certainly less than its book value , but it 's also not worthless . 
  what italy wants is for banks to be able to transfer loans to the bad bank at a markdown that is fair market value , rather than whatever the current panic market price is . 
   there 's no longer any pretending that the issue is confined to smaller lenders , such as the four that italy 's government rescued last november . 
  the government did n't rescue anything , it facilitated a deal between larger italian banks that themselves rescued the four smaller ones . 
  this kind of details is important because it 's the crux of the current ongoing negotiations . 
   complacency of that sort ended when the european central bank asked six banks for more information . 
  another mistake : as the ecb clarified after poor reporting like this spread a panic , this had been planned months earlier and it has nothing to do with a shift in ecb policy or risk assessment . 
   italy 's prime minister , matteo renzi , has pushed back against some the european commission 's demands . 
  yeah no , let 's be clearer on this . 
  the italian request at the moment is that the bad bank be allowed to mark its loans at fair market value rather than the fire-sale prices the eu is requesting without that being considered state aid . 
  the eu is requesting that the loans be marked at whatever panic-induced rubbish price they would have if they were sold on the market now , which would render the entire operation pointless since the banks could already sell them like that . 
  the point of having a bad bank is that the banks can offload underperforming loans at a significant mark down , but still not at those panic prices that reflect more the uncertainty of the moment than the actual underlying value of the loans . 
   those who demand that greece must not be criticized under any circumstances are a strawman you invented to pre-emptively dismiss any opposing argument .
