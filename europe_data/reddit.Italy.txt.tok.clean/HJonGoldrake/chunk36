  i get that the word ` fence ' is an aphrodisiac to some people , but at least have some idea of the actual phenomenon you want to stop before you run your mouth about telling countries to fuck off . 
  nope , you 're thinking of the infamous * prelievo forzoso * , a levy of .6 % on all deposits enacted during the night between the 9th and 10th of july 1992 by a government in bad need of quick cash . 
  as you can imagine , it was a bit unpopular . 
   in the age of the internet anyone with an inquisitive mind is a few seconds away from finding the answers to any question they want to know . 
  knowing that there 's even a question to ask is the first step and the internet does n't do that for you . 
  education is what should above all teach you critical thinking , whereas in many areas it tends to impress a-critical acceptance of whatever you are taught . 
  the economy is picking up very slowly , as is unemployment ; we are still a long way away from recovering what was lost in the recession , which means we are less equipped to handle a banking crisis now than we were in 2010 , considering also that our public debt is even higher . 
  it 's already begun in italy . 
  italian banks have non-performing loans outstanding worth 16 % of deposits , 4 times higher than in germany for example , 200 billion $ in total . 
  these are loans that we already know will not be repaid . 
  there are about another 100 billion in questionable loans . 
  our government is currently negotiating with european authorities to get an exception to the bail in mechanism so that it can recapitalize the national financial system with public money , as the alternative is either massive bank failures ( with a very large economic , human and political cost ) or the activation of the esm , which no government wants to have hanging over its head . 
   israel is far less of an apartheid state than iran . 
  iran is 98.4 % muslim , israel is only 70 % jewish . 
  south africa in 1991 was only 14 % white , does that mean apartheid did n't exist ? 
  apartheid is a legal framework , not a demographic phenomenon . 
  and i even disagree with the commonly-touted notion that isrsael is an apartheid state , but let 's not get carried away with the argument . 
  there 's an archaic `` cechia '' , but nobody 's used it for decades . 
  `` repubblica ceca '' is what everyone uses nowadays . 
   our other ally the uk ? 
  they went back to their island in no time that 's about as unfair as it gets . 
  french units evacuated together with the british where they could , including the soon-to-be leader of free france and national hero general de gaulle . 
  by the time the british evacuated , the war in france was lost ; standing and fighting would have meant pointlessly sacrificing precious forces that would be needed to resist a possible ( and , as we learned later , indeed planned ) invasion of britain . 
   if someone poses with an isis flag , he or she should be automatically and instantly deported or jailed . 
  i agree , and so should people who pose with nazi flags . 
  edit : what 's wrong with equating isis with the nazis ? 
  surely they are equally as bad ? 
  you surprise me / r/europe :d, 
  `` everyone wins '' except the small companies and private individuals who do n't get the luxury of choosing where they prefer to pay their taxes , and end up footing the bill . 
  he speaks italian and [ some of the cleanest , most articulate english of any european leader ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0kjzeh2jn8 ) . 
   uk house price to crash tempted to cheer , as i 'm about to reach that time in life when i 'd like to buy a house ( and neither me nor my partner work in industries connected to real estate ) . 
  on the other hand , the crash of a bubble this large and this long might bring about a lot of far-reaching economic shockwaves . 
   fascism is an economic system . 
  no , it is n't . 
  fascism is a political ideology that deals with the economy as well , but it 's about so much more than that . 
  if i were to put it as succintly as possible , i would say that fascism is a political system that purpots to end intercine conflicts within the nation ( for example , the class conflict between burgeoisie and proletariat ) by submising all within the state , enforcing harmony through authoritarianism . 
   for spain and italy it 's easier to manage their borders because they do n't have hundreds upon hundreds of islands for migrants and refugees to land on . 
  yep . 
  we literally have only one island , lampedusa , which is targeted by people smugglers . 
  greece has hundreds . 
   the issue is that wihout hotspots there can be no coordinated redistribution . 
  false on the face of it : we 've already agreed to a plan to redistribute 160 000 refugees and we have n't had hotspots to do it . 
  what is lacking is the will and the mechanisms to actually redistribute people without each transfer having to be individually agree-to and arranged at the highest level of government , like it is now in practice . 
  without a functioning redistribution system , the hotsposts plan is the rest of europe going back to shovin the problem on the border nations . 
  there is literally no reason for us to agree to a hotspot system when even redistribution of registered refugees that has already been agreed is n't happening . 
  i was referring more to the planned expansion and systematization of the mechanism than to rebranding of immigration centers that has been happening these past few months . 
  the actual ` hotspots ' system should include robust fingerprinting and detention \\ containment measures , which are so far barely more functional than they used to be . 
  this is why the `` hotposts '' concept is horseshit that i seriously hope our government will reject . 
  there is no functioning relocation plan for even the refugees that are already here ; accepting to keep more refugees in greece and italy because `` hey this time we 'll help you relocate them , we promise '' is a bit like putting your hand in the mouth of the croc hoping * this time * it wo n't bite . 
  one the most rabid , fanatical pieces i 've ever read on american mainstream media . 
  if somebody had sent this to me saying it 's fluff material from a dystopic rpg where an authoritarian government uses us media to shape the narrative , i would have believed it . 
  the contention of this article is , essentially , that european privacy regulations are ` sabotage ' for us ` terror intelligence programs ' . 
  the title itself is so patently massaged with the right words it 's cringeworthy :  time to get serious about europe 's sabotage of us terror intelligence programs if we translate this into what it actually means , here 's what it says :  time to blackmail europe into dropping the privacy regulations which are hampering american dragnet surveillance because that 's it , if you read the article . 
  the item of contention is the eu overturning the safe harbor provision and preventing the us from easy access to all that juicy data that european citizens and companies store with american companies , because of inadequate us privacy safeguards . 
  the suggestion is that the us congress forbid all intelligence sharing with europe until we relent . 
  there is n't much more to the content than this . 
  the really interesting thing about the article is the angle and tone : rabidly self-righteous , littered with double-speak , cherrypicking and distorting facts and figures to paint a grotesque version of events in which the poor mistreated us once again has to drag the eu kicking and screaming towards what 's right . 
  disgusting , and pretty astonishing to see this published on the washington post .

  this guy is a sworn enemy of any form of privacy and slobbering fan of the government prying into your private life as much as it wants whenever it wants . 
  and the worst thing is that he 's not insane , he 's just a massive asshole . 
  because abandoned towns do n't have water , electricity , heating or facilities to provide for food and other consumable necessities of life . 
  rental prices have nothing to do with this initiative . 
  people wo n't rent new apartments with this program ( you have to actually take the person into your family , not just host them somewhere ) . 
  it 's a cheap way to handle a few hundred asylum seekers in spare rooms that are already there but are n't used at the moment .

  my family has had a looong history of using the italian ssn , so in the field of personal experiences i have some to give :  how much do prescriptions cost ? 
  if you have an exemption , for example due to chronic condition , low income or age , nothing . 
  otherwise , the prices are quite cheap compared to the cost of living - you will not normally face financial difficulties because of prescriptions . 
   do doctors treat you well ? 
  never had a doctor treat me badly , most are positively nice . 
  in general , they are all very caring and attentive . 
   is universal healthcare worth the higher taxes you pay ? 
  it 's not just worth it in financial terms , being cheaper than an insurance-based system ; it 's worth it in terms of mental peace . 
  rather than have to juggle with insurance and related bullshit , i just go to the doctor and get what i need , period . 
  in general , healthcare in italy is excellent . 
  it 's routinely ranked among the very best in the world for quality of care and outcomes , and despite all the self-criticism we produce on it it 's even quite efficient compared to similar countries . 
  i would n't exchange it for a us-style system for anything . 
   the government is right the government is lying : patients ** already ** get the same quality of care at the weekend . 
  what the government is doing is fucking over junior doctors by doing precisely the opposite of what you say they should be doing :  it 's just also exactly why physicians should be paid more to work those hours ( they have lives , too ) , and why their hours should n't be overextended . 
  junior doctors will have to work longer hours for less pay with the new contract . 
  that 's why they 've taken the unprecedented step of striking .

  olive oil and tomatoes are from other regions , the naples area is more milk derivatives . 
   he considered all land in italy to be definitely compromised due to how wide-spread and profitable it was yeah no , source on that ? 
  `` all land in italy '' is obvious horseshit , and far too much of this has been spread around and ended up creating stupid things like `` boycott all italian cheese '' when there are cheeses that are n't made even remotely close to the affected areas . 
   not true at all . 
  yep , same thing i immediately thought . 
  a friend of mine got himself in a ditch for this exact oversight . 
  fortunately nothing too bad happened but he sure held onto his nuts tightly from then on . 
  be that as it may , apple was n't confused when it set up its scheme to divert italian profits abroad . 
  it did n't make a good faith mistake , it knowingly tried tax evasion and failed .
