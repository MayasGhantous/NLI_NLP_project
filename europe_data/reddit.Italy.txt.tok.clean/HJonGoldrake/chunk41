   still , it 's an excellent idea . 
  it is . 
  renzi talks about many excellent ideas . 
  so far , he has delivered on so few of his plans that there 's no reason to believe any one of his announcements until they are realized ; especially those that require large investments . 
  he 's gotten so bad with it we 've coined the term * announcitis * for his condition , and there are several polygens for his announcements ; [ there 's even an english version , in true renzi inglish !, 
  do n't take renzi 's announcements at face value . 
  the guy is a master at announcing grandiose , imaginative plans that then get stuck in trivialities like actually finding the money for them . 
  one billion is no joke in italy 's current fiscal situation and culture is always the first to fall when it comes to prioritizing . 
  i 'll be very surprised if this plan does n't turn out to be less than announced , based on unsound financing plans ( like ppis , which mostly never pan out ) or both . 
   also i think people are aware of the women in paris that blew herself and a dog up she did n't blow herself up ; though she was killed in a suicide blast , it was n't her own . 
  and the dog was shot dead , hhe did n't die in the explosion . 
  nontheless , as far as we know the woman was partecipating in the armed defense of the house . 
  i 'm just telling you what the law is , not what it ought to be . 
  personally i do n't like this part of the tulps in general as it 's a ) written like shit and b ) mostly used to have an excuse to harass street protesters rather than ensure anyone 's security . 
   and my favourite : during the last stand of the kouachi brothers , they disclosed on tv the presence of a guy hiding in the same building . 
  ( luckily , those two were not watching tv and the guy escaped ) . 
  did anyone get righteously ass-reamed over this ? 
  this is so fucking stupid there is just no excuse . 
  `` it is forbidden to wear protective helmets , or any other means capable of making recognition of a person difficult , in a public place or a place open to the public , ** without a justified reason ** . '', 
  you can enter a caf\u00e9 with your bike helmet on if you are going in to grab something and leave right away . 
  you can wear a scarf if you have a cold . 
  and you can , as the courts have found , wear a niqab for religious reasons . 
  a burqa has , as far as i know , not being tested in a court case yet . 
   jesus was a pacifist that negates a lot of the calls for human rights abuses in old testament i.e. 
  `` he who i without sin cast the first stone . 
  that episode has nothing to do with pacifism or human rights and everything to do with jesus demostrating his doctrinal superiority over the pharisees . 
  have you read it recently ? 
  because it starts like this :  at dawn he appeared again in the temple courts , where all the people gathered around him , and he sat down to teach them . 
  the teachers of the law and the pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery . 
  they made her stand before the group and said to jesus , `` teacher , this woman was caught in the act of adultery . 
  in the law moses commanded us to stone such women.now what do you say ? '', 
  the pharisees are trying to put jesus in an impossible situation . 
  on the basis of the law , he should tell them to stone her ; but if he tells them to stone her , he would be reported to the romans who did not permit the jews to hold their own executions ; and he ca n't stay silent or refuse the challenge . 
   they were using this question as a trap , in order to have a basis for accusing him . 
  but jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger . 
  when they kept on questioning him , he straightened up and said to them , `` let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her . '', 
  if you read this out of context , it seems like jesus is putting to the pharisees a simple question of hypocrisy : `` she might be a sinner , but who among you can claim to have never sinned ? '', 
  that 's not the case though . 
  as is typical of many episodes of jesus comfronting the pharisees , this one is rooted in the context of jewish law , and is meant to show that jesus had a greater understanding and knowledge of it . 
  in this instance , jesus is pointing out that the pharisees have broken the scripturally mandated procedure for this type of trial . 
  they should have produced the male adulterer as well , and they should have produced witnesses ; the law also specifically mandated that one of the witnesses must start the stoning . 
  by challenging one of them to cast the first stone ( something they know they can not do , because none of them is a witness to the adultery ) , he 's forcing the pharisees to confront the fact that they 've all broken the law by ignoring all procedure , and puts them to shame for trying to use the law to attack him while breaking it themselves . 
  in fact , his victory here is * precisely * that he does n't negate that the woman should be stoned : if he did , he would be negating the law and be discredited as a teacher . 
   plus you would have literally hundreds of millions of military age males from all over north africa , the caucasus , the middle east and the stans pouring into russia yes . 
  that 's how war , logistics , mass psychology and religion all work . 
   if the meditterreanan countries did what was obliged to them to do cry me a river . 
  when italy was trying to do `` what was obliged to '' us to do , sweden sued us for expelling rejected asylum applicants . 
  that you 'd now complain about the mess you helped make is the height of self-righteous hypocrisy . 
   companies like ireland because they have n't got to hire tax optimisers . 
  that 's simply not true . 
  the reason ireland , the netherlands and luxembourg are popular for incorporation of multinationals is that they allow for several schemes that let you pay their ( lower ) tax rates on money you made in other countries . 
  tax optimisers are hired by the bucketful to set up these schemes , since their cost is a drop in the ocean of money companies save by reducing their tax liabilities . 
   the dominican republic issued arrest warrants on monday against a member of the european parliament and two other french nationals for helping a pair of french pilots convicted on cocaine trafficking charges flee the caribbean nation by speedboat . 
  we should deny them on the grounds of the rule of cool . 
   but gender and identity politics have taken over the campus . 
  last year they tried to change the uni 's name because humboldt was a `` rich straight dead cis ablebodied male '' . 
  i took a look at the site and it 's still called humboldt . 
  did they manage to get anything done with their `` taking over the campus '' , or is this the usual vocal but powerless radical student group ? 
  we 'll just fix that with a flair \\ ^ ^ btw , please do n't post too many articles about marion le pen . 
  my heart ca n't handle the contradictions between hating her politics and the turmoil she stirs in this old decrepit body . 
  since the usual comments have already started , let me try to shed some light on what actually happened so the outrage can at least be based on facts : - the nights before the l'aquila earthquake , a great risks committee gathered ( as mandated by law ) to make a risk assessment - the risk assessment was somewhat rushed , owing in part to the need to publish it quickly - additionally , there was almost no coordination of the media aspect of the risk assessment ; various members of the committee spoke freely with journalists , speaking their mind in plain language and foregoing the precise scientific evaluations - essentially , several people told the inhabitants they should go home since there was n't a risk , even though strictly speaking they could n't positively state there was no risk - the earthquake happened - in the aftermath , analysis of those declarations and the risk assessment convinced a prosecutor that members of the committe had been criminally negligent in both preparing and presenting the risk assessment # ** faqs ** * they were prosecuted for not predicting an earthquake !, 
  * yes and no . 
  the prosecution really did make part of its case on the basis the scientific part of the risk assessment had been inadequate ( a claim that is fairly doubtful in my opinion ) , but they never went as far as claiming the scientists should have predicted the earthquake . 
  most of the prosecution 's case rested on the somewhat careless ( but imho understandable for non-media-trained personell ) statements released outiside of the formal risk assessment . 
  * this was a sham trial !, 
  * it was about as shammy as any contentious trial where the prosecution 's case is n't clear-cut . 
  there were arguments presented by both sides , many dismissed , and several layers of review and appeal . 
  nothing out of the ordinary happened in terms of procedure and the normal legal guarantees were in place . 
  * this betrays how italian prosecutors do n't believe in science !, 
  * yes and no . 
  yes , because unfortunately far too many prosecutors take science to be whatever expert assessment they can get from a friendly consultant that supports their case . 
  no , because they did n't actually uphold unscientific beliefs , they more tried to bend the science as far as it would go in supporting their case . 
  but remember , most of this case rested on the weight of the informal statements , not the formal risk assessment . 
  ------ ** my opinion ** : this was a fuckup due to two very big oversights : not giving pre-emptive immunity to scientists making official risk assessments for being potentially wrong ( so no prosecutor could even try to mount a case , no matter the merit ) , and not tighetening down the media aspects of a very emotionally charged situation where only media-trained people should have spoken to the public . 
  it also does n't help that careerism pushes prosecutors to mount high-profile cases on shaky grounds , but that 's hardly a specifically italian problem unfortunately . 
   yeah , but that 's what a lot of other pro-choice people i know do . 
  they just refuse to acknowledge that the ` pro-life ' side has any leg to stand on . 
  uh , the same could be said the other way around . 
  it 's an obviously polarized debate , it 's not like one side is more at fault than the other . 
   it 's mostly due to debates about at which trimester a foetus is consider to be a baby , but that is , as you say , just imagining the issue away . 
  not really though . 
  your conception of human life is something that you have to imagine - you have to decide at which point a group of cells is considered a human . 
  that 's not undue . 
  what is undue is behaving as if there were no material difference between a foetus ina womb and a born child - there is a material difference between the two , and making an argument on the assumption of `` imagine if there were n't '' does n't make sense logically . 
   but imagine that instead of them being in the womb , they have already been born that 's kind of the point though . 
  you ca n't dismiss the principal characteristic of the issue by imagining it away . 
  all three categories are people who are already born , unlike an unborn foetus . 
  your logic is faulty . 
   the scientific consensus is that a foetus is a living organism and thus abortion is the destruction of a life . 
  using `` destruction of ** a life ** '' is pretty dishonest here . 
  while technically true , `` a life '' has a clear connotation of `` a human life '' i.e. 
  a human being . 
  and there is definitely ** not ** a scientific consensus on when a foetus becomes a human being . 
  an extra 0 slipped in there , though $ 5.99 sounds a fair bit too low . 
  if we want to turn frontex into something serious , rather than something with the resources of a small town police station , i 'm all for it . 
  but it 's going to have to be tightly integrated with an internal security service : we ca n't have people with expertise on protecting the border that ca n't do nothing once whatever should n't have crossed is discovered to have crossed .
