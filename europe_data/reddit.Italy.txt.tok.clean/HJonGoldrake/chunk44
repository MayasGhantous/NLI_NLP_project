  when the allies invaded , they used the mafia contacts of several italian expatriates to prepare the terrain , but those contacts worked with mafiosi who had never stopped operating in sicily . 
  after the war , the mafia was oftentimes kept ` in retainer ' to ensure that the south would remain firmly anti-communist , as the big fear then was that the communists would try a takeover given the large popular support and significant number of communist resistant fighters . 
   mainly because of what they did on ukraine especially but after they are trying to get rid of all anti-goverment and terroristic groups in syria i kinda became neutral on them the thing is that what they do in syria does n't make the situation in ukraine any better . 
  russia is n't trying to rehabilitate itself and atone for ukraine , it 's just playing another hand of its geopolitical game : in ukraine it 's about ensuring that its neighborhood is firmly under its thumb , in syria it 's about making sure that the friendly assad regime does n't fall and eliminate russia 's only remining foothold in that strategic region . 
  no , but they have a special administrative status which means they receive large positive net fiscal transfers per capita . 
  they also use them very well , so they have a well-ordered , prosperous and beautiful region . 
   if all you friend go to an opera and you ca n't afford it , that 's `` risk of social exclusion '' if all you friend meet each summer to ski and you ca n't afford it you fall behind socially in respect to your friend . 
  that 's why we call it risk of social exclusion . 
  that 's not at all what the map represents . 
  the index is built out of three indicators : chronic joblessness , financial poverty after welfare transfers , and material deprivation ( stuff like being unable to pay for heating in winter or not having adequate shoes ) . 
  you are not considered at risk of social exclusion because your friends can go on skiing trips and you can only afford one week at the seaside . 
  that 's a complete misrepresentation . 
  the hypocrisy of this guy is thick and creamy ( but then again he 's the us secdef , it 's kind of his job ) , but in the haste of pointing that out let 's not forget that russia invaded and is occupying a big portion of another european country . 
  they are not averages , they are the tax rate which a model company ( a company with a certain standardized structure constructed for this exercise ) would pay in each country . 
   one thing 's for certain , i can tell for a fact that there 's a ton missing in barcelona and surrounding areas . 
  there 's a ton missing anywhere that is n't england , beneleux , germany and the czech republic . 
  this seems more like a map of breweries that are known in the us ( where this map was made ) than an actual map of european breweries .

   even american states have the right to decide their tax levels . 
  the eu would have more power than the usa federal government if they had a say in the level of tax each of us pays ... 
  there are plenty of federal taxes in the us . 
  in fact , i ca n't think of a federal government which does not levy any kind of federal tax . 
   define poverty . 
  `` this target is monitored using the headline indicator ` percentage of the population at risk of poverty or social exclusion ' . 
  it is an aggregate of three sub-indicators : people living in households with very low work intensity ; people at risk of poverty after social transfers ; severely materially deprived people . '', 
   if a millionaire moves next door does it mean i 'm poor ? 
  nope . 
  the indicator shown is basically a composite of being perpetually out of a job , not making enough money even after social benefits , and actually materially lacking things like clothes and home heating in winter .

   because there 's not enough work as we speak there is plenty of work . 
  there are housing shortages in quite a few countries , most badly need infrastructure maintenance and upgrades , our countrisides have been abandoned for decades and the work of maintaining levies , dredging canals , clearing up the bush , firming up the hillsides and so on has lagged behind . 
  there is plenty of work , even for manual labourers . 
  but we have an economic system that ties up immense amounts of accumulated wealth and future income in the hands of a few , driven by the profit imperative rather than the satisfaction of our needs . 
  this is why there is no employment even if there is lots of work . 
  i do n't know if it 's ` most ' but it 's certainly a lot , especially in europe . 
  we do that too , but there used to be a strong expectation that the winning coalition leader would get the job ; the old electoral law even mandated a pre-election pm nomination by each coalition . 
  the fact that monti , letta and renzi became prime ministers without being the leader of a winning coalition was perfectly legal , but lots of people saw a democratic deficit in that , especially since all three undertook deep reforms whose popular legitimacy was at best unclear . 
  i tend to agree with that notion and i think it was cowardly of several parties not to go to elections , but i do n't contest that they were legally entitled to act like they did . 
   i 'm curious to know why this is ? 
  it 's a joke , because the turks were the ones to finally destroy the eastern roman empire ( to which ravenna belonged , although not at the time of its final fall ) . 
  the progression of pms highlights something funny : `` we did n't elect this guy ... nor this one ... nor this one ... hey here 's one we elected ! '', 
  `` who 's he ? '', 
  `` berlusconi '' '' ... you are better off without this electing people business '' [ before i get torn a new one : i know we do n't directly elect pms , but the last 25 years it 's been the de facto practice that the leader of the winning coalition would become pm , so in that sense we do elect them ] ------ also of note : those villa dei misteri pictures have their saturation turned way up . 
  which is actually a pretty good thing because we are fairly sure , but not completely sure , that that 's more what the original pigments would have looked like . 
  romans loved their colors . 
  ------ oh and the bologna thing ? 
  that 's not op 's joke , it 's really what happened . 
  the old roman town with its square grid got a semi-circular annex where the conquering lombards established themselves .

   thousands of years ago there were n't jihadists with explosives . 
  the pyramids are right next to cairo , and i mean right next . 
  unless cairo were conquered by jihadists , there would be no way for them to reach the pyramids with any amount of explosive close to what they 'd need to damage the pyramids . 
   if pyramids would be left unattended , they 'd soon become a target for extremists and treasure hunters . 
  they 've already been thouroughly looted a loooong time ago . 
   you saw what isis did with monuments in palmyra . 
  isis had control of the region and the time to demolish the site , which is also much less massive ( in terms of actual mass ) than the pyramids . 
   i think capitalism is stable capitalism has a built-in cyclical crisis feature and every single time it requires public intervention to pick itself up , and every single time it leaves less and less to the working class . 
  mmmh , the joys of capitalism : - food : need massive subsidies and state intervention to keep the supply steady and regular - energy : need massive state regulation to keep supply steady and massive state intervention to push industry to innovation - infrastructure : need massive state intervention to upgrade and repair infrastructure , even when it 's privatized - science : need massive state investment into basic research because private actors wo n't undertake it capitalism works to supply optional things like iphones , but when it comes to guaranteeing the pillars of modern life it fails miserably . 
  making sure that everyone has what they need and we think for the future does n't pad quarterly profits enough . 
  less `` give in '' and more `` happily recruit them to suppress trade unionism and any kind of left wing political agitation '' . 
  i 'm not aware that we did anything like that to any appreciable scale . 
  the pyramids lasted thousands of years with zero maintenance but they 'd be long gone without mass tourism ?
