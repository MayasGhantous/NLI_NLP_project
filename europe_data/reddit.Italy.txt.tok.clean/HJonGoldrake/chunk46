   police will be able to access the records without any judicial approval ; a person 's website browsing records can be obtained after a `` designated senior officer '' grants an authorization . 
  so literally thousands of people across the uk will be able to grant authorization to access anyone 's browsing data . 
  thousands of points of failure , tens of thousands of systems across every police station that are points of entry for hackers to access invaluable information . 
  beside the orwelling surveillance aspect of this , the security design is most scary one . 
  a single corrupt officer could become a one-step gateway to the browsing habits of any political or business rival ; a single incompetent one could compromise his system by plugging in a usb key or downloading an attachment , and thereby grant unlimited access to invaluable information to god knows who . 
  if you are only reading the comments , read the full article . 
  it 's seriously well-written and the details are scary as fuck .

   my dream is that one day i get [ refugee status ] and stay here . 
  too easy mate . 
  you are a self-confessed economic migrant , the international protection system is not for you it 's for people fleeing war and political , religious , ethnic and other kinds of persecution . 
  i do n't know what chances a serbian citizen has of legally immigrating to germany for work , but that 's the path that 's open to him if he wants to go germany for the better work situation . 
  i think there is a mix of ignorance ( i.e. 
  uneducated people not knowing how the hell to start the legal immigration process ) and greed ( refugee status is very attractive when you come from nothing and get free lodgings , healthcare and a monthly allowance larger than what you could have made back home if you found a job ) . 
  either way , it 's good that germany is speeding up deportations of rejected applicants . 
  38.000 people this year ( linked in the article ) is much more than i had thought . 
   police are investigating what part he played in an alleged attempt to extort money from fellow french international mathieu valbuena . 
  benzema makes # 8.1 million a year . 
  if he really did get involved in this for money , he 's a really , really greedy idiot . 
   gangsters allegedly conspired with local politicians to siphon off funds intended for migrant and refugee centres , and for rubbish collection in rome and the surrounding lazio region . 
  it 's not so much that they siphoned it off as that they made sure the contracts were assigned to their partners and associates , who would subsequently provide the cheapest possible service in order to reap massive profits . 
  kickbacks from those profits would travel back across the chain to reward the partecipants , including the politicians who had piloted procurement . 
   last week , the current mayor of rome , ignazio marino , was forced to resign in an unrelated scandal involving expenses . 
  that 's incorrect . 
  the expenses scandal emerged , marino tendered his resignation , more details emerged and showed that the scandal had been part overblown , part fabricated ( people swore that they had seen him at dinner with friends rather than the dignitaries he had put down on the expenses note , only to recant under closer scrutiny ) , then marino withdrew his resignation . 
  the city council could then have forced him to step down with a motion of no confidence , but instead a mass resignation by the majority 's councilors automatically triggered new elections , rendering the issue moot . 
  it should be noted that marino himself contributed to the mafia capitale investigation by proactively reporting irregularities in the city administration to the authorities . 
  he had been fighting against an entrenched system of corruption and good-old-boy business , and had already been targeted with fabricated scandals like unpaid parking tickets for his car , which turned out to be due to the unexplained removal of his car 's plates from the city 's traffic cameras database .

   that alarm in your head that 's been programming itself for the last few million years a few decades at best , and only in some cultures . 
  men weeping and being emotional ? 
  that was what manly men did when romanticism was the going philosophy in europe . 
  women were thought to be the unemotional gender , because their little minds could n't conceive of such high and noble things as love and feeling . 
  in the middle ages , women were the horndog gender whose instincts needed to be kept in check , because they did n't have the discipline and purity to do that . 
  men holding hands ? 
  sure , that 's what friends did , still do in many cultures today . 
  mouth kissing ? 
  plenty of cultures use it as a simple salutation , including among men . 
  anal sex with men ? 
  no problem in ancient greece , they did n't even have a concept of being homosexual , you just fucked dudes if you liked that ( but you still got your wife pregnant , so you could have kids and keep the family going ) . 
  your automatic disgust for ` effeminate ' or gay men is based on your perception of what 's effeminate and on your notion of effeminate behaviour being undesirable , both of those rooted in your peculiar culture and upringing in the late 20th \\ early 21st century . 
  there 's almost nothing that goes back millions of years about it .
