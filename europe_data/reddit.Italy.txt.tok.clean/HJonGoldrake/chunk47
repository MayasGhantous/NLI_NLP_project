   angela merkel is hoping that a proposal for more reception centers in areas where refugees land at europe 's external borders will ease the influx into germany . 
  so push the problem out to overwhelmed and financially troubled italy and greece . 
  thanks angela but no thanks , we 've already tried that for a couple of years .

   i realise it 's not equal to a tweet that 's the point though . 
  rioting because someone was killed ( right or wrong that you are in your grievances ) is not in the same ballpark as rioting for a racist tweet .

  it 's a pretty weird election on the republican side . 
  the democrats are having the usual competition between the centrist establishment candidate and the runner up from the left of the party , no surprises there . 
  the republicans were supposed to do the same thing , having jeb as the establishment guy and someone from the right of the party to drag him a bit towards that and later legitimize the winner as a true republican . 
  instead , the right wing of the party is much bigger and much more vocal than it should have been , and has put two decidedly non-establishment candidates at the forefront of the run . 
  a bombastic buffon with a god complex and plenty of money to push it . 
  he 's raking in the votes from all the people who like someone who speaks plainly , plays to win and wants to get shit done and fuck the haters and the pc police . 
  that he 's managed to become this popular speaks more to the weakness of the ` serious ' candidates ( jeb in particular , but cruz and rubio too , the cardboard cutouts that they are ) than to his strengths . 
  carson is scary , or rather his popularity is . 
  while i get the appeal of a confident ultra-populist like trump , carson seems to embody the nutjob , anti-science religious right that one would hope is becoming weaker and more irrelevant and seems to instead be strong enough to put him at the head of the race ( at least as far as polls go , which is not very far but it 's what we have ) . 
  he 's , honestly , a more frightening option for potus than trump . 
  the original title was about how the mafia is ` on the run ' due to the shopkeepers revolt . 
  reading your title , the reader gets the impression that the article is about how shopkeepers are under protection because they spoke up .

  he 's the chief of the italian football federation ( the governing body of italian football ) , if he does n't like meeting gay people and jews it 's a pretty big issue for the gay people and jews that have to meet him . 
   if he was spouting out `` i hate gays and jews '' but he just does n't want to be near them not wanting to be near someone because they are gay or jewish is textbook homophobia and antisemitism respectively . 
  homophobia and antisemitism are fair enough ?

   a smoker does n't have to steal for a fix there is such a thing as a broke smoker . 
  the difference is that a broke nicotine addict will grind up cigarette butts from the trash if he 's fixing that hard , he wo n't steal from his family because it 's insanely painful being without the next dose .

   tobacco is absolutely in the same ballpark as heroin the data in your article actually says that heroin is more addictive than tobacco in 4 of the 5 metrics examined . 
   the effects you 're citing have nothing to do with the addictiveness of heroin , but are to do with the fact that heroin is illegal , while tobacco is not . 
  let me get this straight : you seriously , honest to goodness , believe that heroin addicts sometimes resort to robbery and burglary to fuel their habit * because * heroin is an illegal substance ( and not because it 's incredibly more addictive than most others ) , while smokers never resort to the same means because tobacco is legal ( and not because it 's much less addictive than cocaine ) ? 
  i give up . 
  you live in a delusional parallel reality where a heroin habit is about as big of a problem as smoking ; you cite data that contradicts your belief fully convinced that it actually supports it . 
  there ca n't be a discussion if both partecipants are not grounded in some basic sense reality , and right now you are n't .

   who , exactly , has proposed that legalization ought to consist of nothing but `` saying that it 's all legal now '' ? 
  bowgentle , who literally said that immediately after legalization 100 % of the drug market would be in the hands of criminals . 
   a need for drug regulation does n't mean that we have to criminalize drug users . 
  you are , again , trying to win a reddit debate , and not at all paying attention to what is being said and by whom . 
  i never supported criminalization of drug use , in life , on reddit or in this thread . 
  you have gotten convinced that you are arguinging with someone who opposes legalization and are trying to win the debate by proving them wrong on minutiae , because that 's how you score points on reddit . 
  i suspect bowgentle is doing exactly the same thing , and i 'm interested in neither attempt . 
  arguing that legalization is n't a panacea , must take into consideration the existing reality of the drug trade and requires regulation is n't at all equivalent to arguing for the criminalization of drug use . 
  it 's simply taking off the rose-tinted glasses of people ( actual people who i 've been talking to in this very thread , not imagined rhetorical enemies ) that think we should go ahead with legalization and not worry if the supply is the hands of international drug cartels or if the substances being sold have really serious addiction and health problems . 
  of course not , because it was n't . 
  now , instead of trying to score points by calling out the minutiae of the minutiae ( and still being wrong about it ) , would you be interested in actually engaging with my core argument ? 
  which is , for those of you who have just now tuned in , that drugs like cocaine , heroin and meth are inherently dangerous and their legalization ca n't just consist of saying `` yep , it 's all legal now '' ? 
  that tobacco smokers rarely if ever turn to crime to feed their addiciton while alcoholics are more likely to do so ? 
  of course . 
  i never denied that . 
  you should tell bowgentle , he 's the one that grouped them together . 
   so does the gambling industry it does , and it should n't be able to . 
  the plain nonsense is arguing that heroin addiction is in the same ballpark as tobacco addiction . 
  it 's entirely obvious that it 's not , and i wo n't go into any attempt to convince you otherwise ; you are clearily not reasonable about this topic if you genuinely ca n't see the difference . 
   the magnitude of the issue is only the same as for alcohol and tobacco , and that only for some drugs . 
  is it a recurring problem that tobacco smokers rob people in the street or steal from their own families to feed their addictions ? 
   my one question would be is how soon can it be ready not soon at all , but that 's not a good reason to defund iter . 
  we can fight climate change and push ahead with iter at the same time ; it 's not the iter budget that 's holding back proper environmentalism . 
   in her article , miss reece suggested that the review should also introduce an assumption that sex offenders including child abusers posed no threat once they had served their sentence . 
  why would you * assume * they no longer pose a threat ? 
  simply conduct an evaluation . 
  there is no way to consider that a violation of someone 's human rights , you are simply balancing their right to live in society with the right of others to be safe from violence . 
   first this is for the us , which is very different from europe please show that 's the case . 
  i would have happily brought out numbers for the whole european drug market if i could find them . 
   then the market for cannabis is according to that bigger , that for any of those drugs cannabis has a plurality , not majority market share .
