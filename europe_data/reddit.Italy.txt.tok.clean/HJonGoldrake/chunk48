  other drugs still out-trade it . 
   also for cocaine more than half of the money is spent by users which are not typical addicts ( use less than `` near daily/daily '' ) . 
  who says that addicts are only people who use daily ? 
  do you seriously consider people in the `` use more than weekly '' category not addicts ? 
   also this study only looked at those 4 drugs - that 's far from being the complete market . 
  which other illegal drug beside cannabis , cocaine , heroin and methamphetamines represents such a large trade that only considering those four is `` far '' from being the complete market ? 
   why should convicted murderers or rapists be allowed near other human beings ? 
  murderers and rapists that have a psychological attraction to murder and rape are not , in fact , allowed near other human beings .

  if your problem is with the use of the word victim , then use `` smargafar '' to describe people who began a behaviour that later led to negative consequences on which they no longer had a choice . 
  either way , i would want someone who gave themselves smallpox treated in the same way that i 'd want someone who developed a drug addiction treated . 
   that 's correct , but only for some very addictive drugs , in particular heroin . 
  for most illegal drugs it is not . 
  [ most of the illegal drugs market is made up of cocaine , heroin and meth ] ( http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/rb9770.html ) , all of them very addictive drugs . 
   i think for most illegal drugs it is , in reference to this issue , comparable to a part of the pharmaceutical , to the alcohol or coffee industry . 
  and in fact both pharmaceuticals with an addictive potential and alcohol are regulated . 
  caffeine , as far as i can find , is not addictive and coffee ` addiction ' is certainly not an issue of comparable gravity to cocaine , heroin or meth addiction . 
   i was n't aware you had to be party to a democracy to expect that your government honor the views of the constituency . 
  this is the simplistc argument you made . 
  when it suits you , it seems that a simple view of democracy is fine ; when it turns out that the `` views of the constituency '' are not what you 'd want them to be , then it 's time to break out the debate on the complex nuances of democracy . 
  you are just reaching for some way not to admit you were plain wrong . 
   the other two thirds were naive . 
  i see . 
  the german government should follow the wishes of its constituents - except when you judge they are naive . 
  it 'd be more honest to argue against immigration without selectively choosing when democracy is ok . 
   sure , ` addiction ' can be a little weaker in some cases than others addiction to junk food is not ' a little weaker ' than addiction to heroin . 
  people will not beg , steal and kill to afford mcdonalds , but they will do that and more to fuel their drug addictions . 
  the magnitude of the issue is of a different order , and pretending that it 's just like any other industry would be dangerous and wrong . 
   if it 's no longer criminal , then there is no criminal element to be tackled . 
  no , that 's excessively simplistic and a little more than dangerous . 
  a policy deployed today , in 2015 , must take into account that these drug trafficking networks exist and will not just go away . 
  nobody gives up of billions in revenue , particularly not people who are used to going to any length to get what they want . 
  we ** will ** see attempts by criminal networks to take over parts of the legal drug industry , and we ** will ** see new drugs be developed and pushed to try and get a foothold outside of the legal , regulated and taxed market . 
  yes , and the german people until a short while ago were in favour of taking in refugees . 
  now they 've switched to mostly believing they are taking too many and the german government has switched to cutting down the flow and negotiating with turkey to stop it entirely . 
  there 's really no way to argue that the german government went against the desires of its people , unless that to you means `` what i think they should have wanted '' . 
   as a result violence between the groups and lack of integration will quite simply happen . 
  all evidence that we have points to the vast majority of attacks against refugees being perpetrated by far-right activists , not common citizens concerned with immigration . 
  the theory that some kind of overall societal threshold has been reached after which violence spontaneously emerges is simply wrong : it emerges because there are nuclei of racists and xenophobes who already systematically employ violence in their activism and who become more active the more immigrants there are . 
  i was a teenager when italy introduced the smoking ban in public establishments , and i can somewhat remember the smell and looks of bars that people had smoked in for hours . 
  now , even designated smoking rooms tend to very fairly clean , given the requirement for good ventilation . 
  exactly that , plus patios , gardens and such . 
  there are plenty of pubs , bars and clubs that have them , especially for the warm season ( but many even in winters , using space heaters ) . 
  interior smoking in public establishments is illegal ; smoking rooms , which need to be air-separated and especially ventilated , can be set up . 
  some of the larger bars and pubs have them . 
  smoking is also legal in exterior spaces .

   drugs are a health issue , not a crime issue . 
  they are both . 
  the drug trade is a multi-billion euro industry that fuels criminal networks worldwide . 
  the criminal side of it actively works to spread and promote its products and enable and cultivate addiction , so there is definitely a criminal issue that needs to be tackled with drugs . 
  now of course that is not the only facet of it , and the big mistake of the war on drugs policy was to assume that it was . 
  drug addicts are addicts , first-time drug users are nearly never criminals ( or if they are it 's unrelated to drugs ) ; drug traffickers , however , are definitely criminals and usually of a very nasty , violent kind given the sums involved and what people are ready to do for that kind of money . 
   i mean , heroin ... that 's a big one . 
  it is . 
  but when you have populations numbering in the millions to hundreds of millions ( if we are talking about europe-wide policies ) , you need to take into account that * some * people will * always * do stupid things , like go on heroin . 
  there is no policy that can stop that , even in the most prohibitionist places . 
  so what you have to do is a ) figure out how to minimize the number of people doing stupid things and b ) figure out how to minimize the damage that people doing stupid things do to themselves and society . 
  based on precedents , it seems that decriminalization combined with strong recovery programs can help combat * both * first-use and continued addiction .
