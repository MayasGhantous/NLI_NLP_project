  i 'd like to say italy , but i do n't see our foreign policy being forceful enough . 
  even with renzi 's death grip on his majority , he does n't seem able to put forward anything concrete on the european stage ; he got mogherini posted as european foreign minister , and that 's about it . 
  i can actually see a bigger role for eastern european countries if they can network and leverage their collective relevance , which is only growing . 
  whenever they 've been a block , they 've managed to significantly impact fp priorities such as with the ukraine situation , baltic patrolling etc. 
  and it 's high time that part of europe counted for more in the eu . 
  hi , thank you for your contribution , but this submission has been removed because it is low quality . 
  see [ r/europe community rules ] ( / r/europe/wiki / community_rules ) in particular , this article alleges that the foreign minister himself stated immigration was leading to collapse , when that 's not the case : he was saying what some people think , not giving his own opinion .

  this should dispel the misinformed notion that the regulation passed by the eu parliament was a `` good first step '' , as has been repeated ad nauseam in the last few days . 
  it was n't , it was a was a terrible regulation full of holes that would permit precisely this kind of behaviour .

   italy is picking them up near africa 's coast and ferry them to italy triton , which is a eu mission rather than an italian one , rescues vessels wherever they are . 
  the only people who are boarding european vessels near the african coast are those at risk of drowning .

  please read the rules about surveys , 
  you 'll have to bring that up with the spectator :  the eu was right to set up search and rescue missions for migrants in danger of drowning in the mediterranean, 
   with migrant boats landing from north africa , european countries could have learned lessons from the australian experience . 
  [ ... ] the passengers should have been returned to whence they came and the traffickers prosecuted . 
  i see . 
  thank you australia for teaching this most important of lessons : when your migrants do not set sail from a country in civil war , you can return them there . 
  i 'm not sure how it 's applicable to north african migration , given that it comes from libya , but i imagine the spectator will let us know in its next brilliant editorial .

  someone in his government , but we do n't and likely never will know who . 
  there have been several of these cases where scandalous provisions have been ` accidentally ' inserted into larger laws by ` someone ' , essentially because many details remain vague until the very last second and it 's easy for the final revisor ( s ) to make last-minute changes to suit a particular political deal or agenda . 
  bit of a , bit of b. 
  both alde and s&d are establishment parties , and the weakened net neutrality bill was sold by the telco lobbyists , the relevant commissioner and the party leaderships as a great package that struck the right balance between allowing the industry to deliver innovative services and protecting the rights of european citizens . 
  it was an easy vote for them : appease the telcos and the commission , get pretty much no flak from the electorate .
