   to do so would be an awful deal because you have to accept all the legislation with no influence on the implementation at all . 
  this is what happens in norway . 
  this is simply not true . 
  non-eu eea countries [ retain influence over european policy at the formation stage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_economic_area#rights_and_obligations ) and afterwards through the [ efta joint committee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_free_trade_association#european_economic_area ) at the implementation stage . 
  they do not passively receive european directives and regulations . 
  well , tell us more !, 
  why is finland in dire economic straits ? 
  it seems ideally positioned to be a good performer : educated workforce , efficient public administration , modern infrastructure , membership to a wealthy trade block , no significant internal or external conflicts . 
  what troubles it ? 
  you present entirely correct arguments which would , once more , apply equally if the uk were a member of the eea instead of the eu . 
  the out campaign has no intention of leaving the common market ; if the in campaign ca n't find a different leg to stand on , it risks getting this one sweeped from under them . 
   when i hear those words , the things that pop into my mind are things like the sokal hoax , not anything even approaching rational thought let alone anything useful . 
  many people share this sort of disdain for the humanities on reddit . 
  yet / r/askhistorians is widely regarded as one of the most interesting and higher quality subreddits , even if its subject matter is quintessentially humanistic . 
  similarly , people gladly read and cherish articles about ancient greek culture , or the discovery of the tomb of a wealthy warrior , or the unhearting of a mosaic in bulgaria . 
  they love the / r/imaginaryx network , which is entirely comprised of art , the quintessential humanistic discipline . 
  the humanities are not disliked , but strangely they are vilified . 
  most people love history , archaeology , anthropology , arts history , the arts in general ( especially the visual arts ) ; most people appreciate great writing and profound novels ; nearly everyone wants great journalists . 
  and of course everyone wants directors and screenwriters who can drag us out of the drudgery of endless sequels and remakes . 
  all of those people are formed in humanities faculties . 
  nobody protests that . 
  they are professions for which there is not only a market , but a great deal of public demand and appreciation . 
  yet somehow the humanities have become identified with useless , self-referential and obscure disciplines . 
  it is truly bizarre . 
  as for funding , how can we lack funding for things for which there is so much demand ? 
  i think it 's because the public at large does n't realize that ` useless ' things like literary critique are the greenhouses in which the creators of the future are incubated , even if they never occupy themselves with literary critique once they 've left university . 
  `` the plan to place an ** end to roaming ** surcharges in europe has been adopted ** pending a review of pricing and consumption patterns ** . 
  even if the review is completed by the 15 june 2017 deadline , roaming surcharges will only be suspended up to a ` fair use ' limit beyond which they still apply and continue to hinder the breaking down of barriers within europe . '', 
  even the end to roaming , touted as a victory for the european consumer , contains poison-pill provisions that can prevent , delay or neuter its implementation . 
  i have n't heard much of an argument for britain to stay in the eu rather than the eea . 
  this seems to be a constant for the in campaign , and it 's going to cripple it if the out campaign highlights it . 
  ** translation ** : spending cuts halve innovation . 
  surprisingly , the draft budget law contains a provision that reduces by 50 % purchases of it goods and services for the public administration . 
  this includes ministries , regions , municipalities and institutions that perform key functions like insp [ national institute for statistics ] , the revenue agency - which would need precisely hi-tech to fight tax evasion - up to research institutes like cnr , the space agency , the italian institute of technology in genua , the astrophysics and nuclear physics institutes . 
  it 's one of the largest cuts of the spending review : as article 29 comma 3 states `` the yearly savings target , starting from the year 2016 , is set at 50 % of the average yearly expenditure in the 2013-2015 period '' . 
  running the numbers , it 's 2.5 billion euroes . 
  what 's left wo n't be enough to pay for internet , smartphones and networks . 
  in essence , there will be trouble covering the bills . 
  it 's a bit of a different picture compared to the narrative that set among the government 's priorities ultrahigh bandwidth internet and the transition to digital of public administration , with even digital champions , 1587 evangelists tasked with accelerating innovation at the local scale . 
  in the last three years there had already been cuts of 9.2 % and 2 % . 
  a further reduction was predicted , and athe 2016 cut was initially supposed to be 10 % . 
  but as the draft was being finalized a flick of the pen - apparently coming directly from the office of the pm - changed the number to 50 % . 
  while it is difficult to know with certainty who is responsible , a member of the parliamentary majority , who elected to speak anonymously , had little doubt : `` simple . 
  in the end , when it 's time to choose , it has no one to stand up for it . '', 
  to be clear , it 's not as if the public administration 's expenditure for computers , networks and services could n't use more efficiency . 
  the equipment stock is obselete , hard to maintain , expensive in repairs . 
  more than half the public databases are not interconnected , with the result that at some point along administrative processes information is printed on paper and re-entered manually in a computer , and data centers in italy are over four thousand . 
  a babel . 
  but to change investment is needed and on this basis it will be impossible . 
  especially since every purchase will have to go through consip , the agency in charge of public administration procurement . 
  `` it 's an incomprehensible vision '' comments in disbelief elio catania , the president of confindustria digital . 
  `` first because it contrasts with the growth and employment policies , of which it is the main engine , and it 's openly in contradiction with the promises made so far by the govenment . 
  second '' he continues `` because it means cutting precisely the main tool to operate a structural spending review '' . 
  just yesterday french president fran\u00e7ois hollande and german chancellor angela merkel announced a partnered initiative to accelerate digital europe . 
  italy , at the bottom of the ranking in europe for hi-tech expenditure , was n't there . 
  for now it prefers to cut on the future . 
   instead , all these big corporations just put their headquarters in ireland where they are n't expected to pay much at all , no lobbying required . 
  nope , that 's not how it works . 
  if they were just moving to ireland and doing business there to exploit the low tax rate , that would be one thing . 
  but that 's not what happens . 
  what happens instead is that companies headquarter themselves in ireland , or luxemburg , or the netherlands , then do business * elsewhere * through subsidiaries and use a variety of tax schemes to shift their tax liability to those tax-favourable jurisdictions , even if they actually made the money elsewhere .

  corporations lobby and campaign at many levels to get favourable tax regimes , they are no blameless third parties ; in many cases , they even deal directly with governments to get personalized tax incentives .

  you have european commisioners who spend years working to facilitate translational business in the eu . 
  they do n't talk to representatives of small guy inc. all that much . 
  when they leave their post they have two choices : either go back into politics , or leverage their business connections and vast experience to work as consultants , board members and advisors . 
  if you hate that , work for the eu to become a fully democratic body concerned with the government of transnational european affairs , rather than a glorified regulator for the european market . 
  that 's what it is now .

   where necessary , she was ready to compromise in order to achieve this . 
  her politics of stability were n't to everyone 's liking . 
  but even many of her critics accepted that the medicine dispensed by `` mother merkel '' was good . 
  funny : when it came to imposing unwanted but `` necessary '' austerity on southern europeans , merkel was an esteemed leader who was respected even by her critics . 
  when it comes to imposing her vision of a migration plan , she 's part of the problem . 
  may that be because this time `` the problem '' is also touching germany and the `` firm but necessary '' leadership is n't so easy to shoulder when it 's imposed on yourself ? 
   hungary 's prime minister , viktor orban , has even openly declared the stream of refugees `` a german problem '' and is cutting his country off . 
  he 's working within the boundaries of the law . 
  requesting that refugees only cross at designated border crossings and promptly register themselves upon entry is * legal * . 
  orban deserves many criticisms , but western media needs to stop assuming they can demonize anything that he does because nobody will stand up for someone like orban : they will only alienate hungarians and anyone who supports hungary 's ( legal ) policies .
