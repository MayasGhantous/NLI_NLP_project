  other people do n't get to vote on whether you can or ca n't leave . 
  this is also a practical principle : even if you think that other people * should * get to vote on it , in practice the ones wanting to leave will never recognize that as legitimate .

   greece has higher rates to pay their debts in the next week than total biscuit surviving his cancer . 
  edgy , now go shitpost on / r/imgoingtohellforthis . 
   socialism did that , not communism . 
   while there are different flavors of communism , all of them advocate public ownership of the means of production . 
  dear god , not this again . 
  socialism * is * a political movement advocating the social ownership of the means of production ( [ reference ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism ) ) . 
  the ussr was called union of the soviet ** socialist ** republics , not of the `` soviet communist republics '' . 
  social-democrats are specifically a different political group that do n't want the social ownership of the means of production . 
   communism is a market or social theory , it is n't a political theory . 
  the book was n't called `` capital : a critique of ** political ** economy '' by mistake . 
  marxism ( and communism , which is founded upon it ) is a system of thought about political economy , not just economy ; one of its central results is that an economic system shapes and is shaped by the political system in profound ways , and systematically results in the class holding economic power also conquering political power . 
  no matter what kind of communist you find , they will always believe that economics and politics are so deeply entertwined you ca n't discuss the one without the other .

   how fucking stupid can you be next time it 's a ban . 
  read the rules , they are in the sidebar . 
  yes , and that 's for negative discrimination ( i.e. 
  blocking or degrading a service ) . 
  now try to read the actual article and realize that the point brought up was about positive discrimination in the form of zero-rating , not negative discrimination . 
   nothing changes . 
  yes , it does :  `` the proposal generally allows zero-rating and gives regulators very limited ability to police it , leaving users and companies without protection against all but the most egregious cases . '', 
  if a service is zero-rated , it does n't count towards a users ' bandwidth cap or usage costs . 
  this means companies could pay isps to be zero-rated -- once again creating an unequal internet . 
  this is from the article in the op , i assumed you had read it . 
  first example that comes to mind : [ zero-rating was illegal in the netherlands ] ( https://edri.org/netherlands-two-telcos-fined-for-net-neutrality-violations/ ) , now it is n't . 
   these surgeries would almost certainly take place over dedicated lines . 
  they would never be competing with netflix bandwidth . 
  of course they would n't , but you can see even in this thread how effective this sort of argument is with tech-unsavvy people . 
  it sounds really convincing that `` remote surgery needs to take precedence over netflix '' , even though that 's not an actual problem that needs fixing and the regulation opens the door to much more than that . 
  and , again , it 's an `` argument '' that actually does n't challenge anything in the opposition 's argument . 
   just because one did n't get everything they wanted does n't mean this is n't very good news there were specific objections to the draft regulation and specific reasons as to why not fixing certain things was a big problem . 
  platitudes are not a counter-argument . 
   this is progress on what we had before . 
  no , it is n't , it 's regress . 
  the previous situation , even if it lacked systematicity , provided for stronger effective protections than we have now .

  similarly , in italy tim music does n't count against your tim data cap . 
  with typical data caps as low as 2 gb per month , that makes even an inferior product like tim music comparatively more attractive .

   what the opposition of these rules demands and reject them blatantly false : the opposition demanded that the ep vote in certain specific amendments that would have closed the loopholes and ensured net neutrality , not the rejection of the legislation . 
  you are attacking an opposition whose arguments you have n't even read . 
  literally your entire argument is name-calling the position and people you disagree with . 
  `` pipe-dream of internet activists '' , `` black-and-white-thinking radical '' , `` everything is absolute shit except for the exact thing he advocates for '' . 
  do you have any actual counter-arguments against the merit of the critics to this regulation ? 
   this . 
  do n't do this , just upvote the submission .

   hopefully people start noting who voted for/against what . 
  the vast majority even of people who use the internet daily have no idea what net neutrality is , let alone its implications . 
  unfortunately , it 's unlikely that pressure to get decent nn regulation will come from anyone but techies and ( some ) tech companies . 
  please , no all caps titles , 
   and forbid \u00dcber !, 
  i wish the uber debate would be less polarized . 
  while it 's true that taxi companies and industry groups are shit , it 's also true that many of uber 's practices are shady as fuck in terms of employment protection , insurance and similarly sensible and necessary forms of regulation . 
   that legislation contained more measures protecting net neutrality than almost any country in the eu has . 
  weasel argument . 
  net neutrality is only recently a hot topic , it 's not surprising that many national parliaments do n't have advanced legislation on it . 
  the european regulation should stand on its merits , not merely on existing . 
   there are few holes in the law , but these either can be fixed on a national level the regulation is intended to armonize the market for digital goods across the eu , national parliaments will be significantly restricted in the way they can strengthen it . 
   or amended later that can be said about any bad law . 
  `` yes this law allows for the murder of children under 2 on a tuesday , but do n't worry it can be amended later '' . 
  it 's no defense of it . 
  also , the more entrenched commercial practices founded upon current nn regulation become , the stronger the `` preservation of industry '' arguments by lobbyists will be if and when amendments are considered . 
  `` but think how many tech jobs will be lost if we ca n't prioritize x service on our network ! '',
