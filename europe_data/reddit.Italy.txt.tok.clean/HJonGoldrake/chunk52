   many openly advocate for the dissolution of germany . 
  even if this is only youthful , nihilistic posturing , its pervasiveness is telling . 
  uh , congratulations on discovering anarchists . 
  they 've been around in germany for something like 150 years . 
   `` move against state and capital . 
  no peace with germany ! '' literally anarchist slogans . 
  is this guy for real ? 
   taken to its natural conclusion , a billion chinese can move into germany tomorrow if they so choose . 
  yep . 
  they are anarchists , you do n't need to extrapolate , they 'll tell you exactly that themselves if you but ask . 
   granted , the above death wish for nation and people , i spotted in connewitz , leipzig 's hotbed for young radicals ... so he 's actually aware that he 's talking about the fringe of the fringe ? 
  why the feigned shock ? 
   these neo-punks an-arch-ists . 
   many germans many ? 
  anarchists are a numerically insignificant portion of the german people . 
   the two countries with the fiercest martial spirit from the last century have been pacified , and perhaps wussified , and that 's why one hears of young japanese men who spend all day , literally , in their childhood room playing video games and looking at porn it 's a bizarre new form of orientalism to reduce japanese society to one metric , militarism , and construct a social theory of hikikomori on the basis of too little militarism . 
   wandering around leipzig and dresden , i see plenty of slogans denouncing fascism , nazism , sexism , anti-semitism and homophobia , but no mention of germany 's complicity in the syrian war . 
  [ look harder ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/juryaz9.jpg ) especially radical left groups of the kind he describes are very active in denouncing german arms sales . 
   next year , who knows how many millions will be welcomed by nsa-bugged merkel . 
  what 's in her closet , i wonder ? 
  to protect her own career , merkel must obey her master . 
  i see . 
  the nsa spies on merkel , which means she 's on washington 's leash ( because she clearly has skeletons in the closet ) , and that 's what her refugee policy is based on . 
  one would wonder why washington did n't yank that leash a few years ago when the german govenment 's position instead that refugees landing in italy and greece should stay there . 
  but that would be giving credit to this sort of simplistic conspiracy theory . 
   should xenophobic outbursts explode down the line , they can be traced back to this initial suppression of dialogue . 
  i see . 
  does the author similarly justify islamic terrorism because islamic extremists have been suppressed by the west ? 
   without patriotism you can not accomplish anything . 
  strange : germany is the leading economy of europe and even considered its most influential country . 
  how did they manage that with their deplorable lack of patriotism ?

   only for the usa we have to see the people as somehow innocent . 
  everyone engages in this sort of hypocrisy , everyone . 
  everyone thinks that the in-group is made up of different people and the faults of each are not the faults of the group , while the out-groups are amorphous and homogenous every individual speaks for their entirety . 
   and how do i get that ? 
  modmail  but we 've already received requests about this particular topic and we 're talking about it . 
  advocacy post need mod pre-approval .
