  so mainstream media is not to be trusted , but confirmation bias is . 
  do n't you see a slight methodological problem here ? 
  you are starting from a conclusion and then looking for its supporting evidence , rather than looking at the evidence and formulating a conclusion . 
  rationality is about trying to find the issues with your ideas as a way to make sure they are sound .

   there is also a strong cognitive dissonance between the way mainstream media presents the situation and the reality resulting in people liking the situation less . 
   for example i do n't want in my country people whom believe woman are a lesser specie or demand changes in local habits because their beliefs might be offended . 
  since mainstream media and ` reality ' differ on the portrayl of this situation , on what sources do you base your perception that migrants see women as lesser and demand changes in local habits because their beliefs might be offended ?

   `` if germany and austria or other states close their borders for migrants , we wo n't allow our countries to become a buffer zone for millions of migrants stranded between turkey and the new barriers that may follow , '' borissov told reporters in sofia . 
  `` we 're also prepared to close our borders immediately . '' [ this is exactly what i predicted would happen when a portion of the cdu announced their plan for a german fence ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pf3o2/refugee_crisis_merkels_party_unveils_secret_plan/cw5r824 ) . 
  a chain reaction of countries scrambling to get rid of the problem since others are doing the same . 
  the end result will be stranding migrants wherever they are , mostly in poorer countries less able to handle them .

  since this clip keeps getting posted over and over and foreign media apparently ca n't get an italian translator to read them the background , let 's just get this over with and clarify . 
  no he did n't do it to defend the right to bear arms . 
  first , because of a trivial point : that right does n't exist in italy , and firearms ownership and carry is a privilege obtained after a hefty licensing process , not a right . 
  his party is n't in favour of making it a right , buonanno himself does n't have a firearms license and that gun is n't even his own . 
  second , because he * actually * [ was n't talking about it ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2015/10/23/news/il_leghista_buonanno_esibisce_pistola_in_tv_show_a_sky_tg24-125758238/ ) : he was trying to promote an initiative by his city administration ( he 's a mayor in borgosesia , a small town in northern italy ) to give a tax rebate on gun purchases . 
  he belongs to a law and order party who has always been in favour of the right to lethal self-defense in one 's own house . 
  third , this was way more about exploiting a recent burglary case where the homeowner shot and killed the would-be burglar . 
  the case is highly controversial because while the homeowner claimed the burglar was in his kitchen when he shot him , forensic evidence seems to indicate that he was actually still climbing up the exterior wall when he was shot in the chest . 
  buonanno 's party immediately came to the defense of the homeowner , and buonanno ( who is n't new to publicity stunts ) found a way to exploit this case to get yet more exposure .
