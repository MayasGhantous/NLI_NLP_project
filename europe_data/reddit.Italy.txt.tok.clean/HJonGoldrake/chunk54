  [ 13 ] on 26 february 2014 , both men were sentenced to life imprisonment . 
  adebolajo was given a whole life order excluding the possibility of parole , and adebowale , the younger of the two , was given a minimum term of 45 years in prison . 
  [ 14 ] that 's just the first case that comes to mind . 
  so long as the cunts do n't off themselves during or after their attacks , they are always prosecuted and always condemned .

   portugal has entered dangerous political waters . 
  for the first time since the creation of europe 's monetary union , a member state has taken the explicit step of forbidding eurosceptic parties from taking office on the grounds of national interest . 
   anibal cavaco silva , portugal 's constitutional president , has refused to appoint a left-wing coalition government even though it secured an absolute majority in the portuguese parliament and won a mandate to smash the austerity regime bequeathed by the eu-imf troika . 
  portuguese redditors : is this as incredibly bad as it sounds ?

  the pkk , which has been fighting isis and has an ideology completely opposed to it , allied with isis to execute a suicide attack against a rally mostly attended by socialists and communists i.e. 
  people in the same part of the political spectrum as the pkk . 
  this is more ridiculous than the bush era `` axis of evil '' rhetoric .

  no , calling people who literally attack children with swords `` vile cunt '' does n't go against the rules of this sub . 
  [ the boston marathon bombing was a terrorist attack , followed by subsequent related shootings , that occurred when two pressure cooker bombs exploded during the boston marathon on april 15 , 2013 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boston_marathon_bombing ) * `` according to fbi interrogators , dzhokhar and his brother were motivated by extremist islamic beliefs , but `` were not connected to any known terrorist groups '' * here 's the page on [ lone wolf terrorism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lone_wolf_ ( terrorism \\ ) ) . 
  seriously , this is not even controversial . 
  so the boston marathon bombing was `` just murder '' , not terrorism ? 
  since when does terrorism need to be organized ? 
  the boston marathon bombers acted in isolation ( unless you want to call two brothers working together an organization ) , yet theirs was undoubitably terrorism . 
  the debate on what constitutes terrorism is complex , but nobody has ever really argued that you need a terror organization to engage in terrorism . 
  could you please provide a source for this photo ? 
  not for credibility , but to credit the author . 
  this is another one of those attempted solutions that would only worsen the problem . 
  poor , uneducated people ( i.e. 
  those who do n't know enough german ) will be made poorer , and have less opportunities to get educated , if you cut their benefits . 
  punishing people economically does n't work when they are nearly with their back against the wall in terms of household finance . 
  you can punish someone by taking away a portion of their disposable income , which provides a disincentive but leaves them otherwise able to function , but when you tap into the money they need to live ( and benefits are part of that , hence why they exist ) you only make their lives more difficult and in return make them less able to engage in the behaviour you want to encourage . 
   there 's a fair chance they 'd slip up sooner or later . 
  and then what ? 
  what 's your imagined punishment for not speaking german at home ? 
   take your bullshit and shove it up your ass chill .

  ~ ~ why are most countries opposed to intra-eu deportation for criminal migrants and re-entry bans ? 
  i can see being opposed to re-entry bans for people who got a parking ticket , but not for real crimes . ~ ~ scratch that , apparently it measn deporting homeless people :|, 
   just to keep some chairs for favors have they sorted out parliamentary immunity ? 
  last version i read , the senators still maintained the privilege against arrests and trials , which would turn the senate into the dumping ground for any corrupt politician that needs shielding from the law .
