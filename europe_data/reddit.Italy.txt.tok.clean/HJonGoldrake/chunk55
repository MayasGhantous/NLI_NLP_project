   ban assault swords . 
  and introduce sword-free zones while we 're at it . 
  does every post about any mass casualty event have to turn into a us-style pro vs anti-gun debate ? 
  no , no it does n't .

  hi , read the rules please , you can can find them in the sidebar , 
   here ends our war of wits , not sporting to continue combat when you 're not armed dank , but still against the rules . 
   the world needs idiots come on , with your superior intelligence : does this seem like a smart choice to you ? 
   and exposing your bias and irrationality  no doubt you think no one else will see this since you 've already censored the submission damn , you crazy shot , you got me . 
  i thought i was being so sneaky by replying publicly where everyone can see with a simple link , instead of using a pm from / r/europe which would actually not even show my username . 
  but you were too keen to fall for my simplistic trickery , and now i pray the price for it !, 
  but yeah , your shitty video is going to stay removed . 
  better luck next time !, 
  actually , all of those things are rules , namely : - low quality - lack of credible sources ( no , screenshots of articles flashed for 5 seconds on the screen are not credible sources ) - agenda pushing - low effort memes and you are welcome , if i could help you believe even harder what you already believed it 's a job well done . 
  it breaks the `` shitty unsourced incredibly biased full of memes '' submission rule .

  the bbc is saying `` reports suggest that some '' , you said `` these people attacked these other people '' . 
  how is that ** not ** misleading ? 
  what you think is probably true is one thing , what the bbc said is another , and you ca n't simply choose to express certainty in the title where your source did n't . 
  that it asserts identification of the people involved despite the article linked not doing so . 
  the source is the journalist in the video , of whose report i made a summary .
