  hi , your story appears to be about a local crime , of which there is an unlimited amount . 
  we try to maintain a good balance of topics on the frontpage ; of the four threads you linked , three constitute a diverse range of peculiar stories , while the fourth is about a criminal gang with connections to international terrorism , and thus particularly relevant . 
  i hope that sufficiently clarifies .

  thank you , i have reinstated your submission now , 
   when western europe let russia die and become the soviet union without even flinching if by `` without even flinching '' you mean [ `` invading with 170 000 troops while also financially and materially supporting the white army '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allied_intervention_in_the_russian_civil_war ) , you are right .

  a text post and a comment are two different things . 
  if you go to the sidebar , under the `` submit a new link button '' , you 'll find `` submit a new text post '' . 
  use that . 
  you do n't need me to give you a chance , when you click `` submit a new text post '' you have all the time in the world to write down everything before i can even see it !,

  is there a language problem or a reddit knowledge problem ? 
  make a self post . 
  you can do so by pressing the `` submit a text post '' button instead of the `` submit a link '' button . 
  once more , please make a self post and explain how this is relevant to europe .

  and that 's a plan ? 
  because the way this is gon na work is that germany puts up a wall , people ca n't get in , they are stranded on the other side . 
  then germany 's neighbors are going to put up walls too . 
  then their neighbors . 
  pretty soon the chain gets to greece , who ca n't put up any wall . 
  i 'm sorry , but this is bullshit . 
  get a plan working with turkey . 
  get people to stop crossing the sea . 
  you have millions of refugees fleeing syria and turkey ca n't and does n't want to handle them all , it already has millions . 
  we either take them in or we help turkey ( and lebanon ) deal with them , or we do both a bit of both . 
  the eu is supposed to have neighborhood policy , correct ? 
  what we have right now is a neighborhood joke . 
  countries making petty , selfish choices and pushing the problem further away hoping someone else will take care of it . 
  this has been the playbook for the last few years and it 's already produced a disaster . 
  keeping up myopic policies like these is only going to exacerbate the issue . 
  no worries , it just that redirects of any kind screw with some mobile apps , filters , reddit 's anti-duplicate filter etc. 
  we try to use automoderator to automatically warn people but we have n't gotten all cases on lockdown . 
  google news is actually going to get added thanks to your post , so actually props to you ,
