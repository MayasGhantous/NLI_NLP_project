   a witness told the irish times she saw the man , who she said was brazilian , get up to go to the toilet halfway through the flight . 
  the woman , who asked not to be named , said he looked `` really unwell '' and climbed over seats to pass cabin crew and reach the rear toilet . 
  a call went out from the captain for any doctors or nurses on board , and it became clear the man had collapsed outside the bathroom , she said . 
    `` at that stage they started to perform cpr , '' she said . 
  `` you could hear him start to ... well , screaming is n't quite the word . 
  it was a guttural noise , like a wounded animal . '', 
  a portuguese man went down to help , the woman said , and he was the one who was bitten . 
    `` the young brazilian man was having a seizure and they were all restraining him . 
  it was n't a random attack . 
  he bit him during the seizure , '' she said . 
  this is the script for every `` man becomes zombie on board of a plane '' scene ever shot .

  ( i highly suggest x-posting this to / r/italy , we have been getting a lot of expo questions and have accumulated a good bit of knowledge by now ) i have n't been , but several of my friends have . 
  the quality varies a lot depending on what pavillons you visit ; i 've been told the israel and us pavillons are pretty spectacular , whereas the italian one is super weird ( lots of conceptual art apparently ) .

  & gt ; putinbot & gt ; leftards & gt ; retarded just do n't . 
  that goes for / u/mysterious _ manny as well . 
  this is against the rules and , besides , it makes for a shitty discussion . 
   i love how ` murican reddit is apeshit left ( dae bernie ??? ), 
  it 's more apeshit `` new guy that talks the talk '' . 
  ron paul was that guy last time around and he 's the polar opposite of bernie in most big policy respects : lower taxes vs higher taxes , much smaller government vs much bigger government , state freedoms vs federal standards . 
  they meet in regards of attacking the influence of money in politics , but that 's neither left or right . 
  oh you can definitely have south tyrol . 
  we pour a ton of money into it ( about as much as in certain poor southern regions ) only to get a ton of angry secessionist rhetoric back . 
  it 's a beautiful , well-run place but if it does n't want to be a part of italy it 's welcome to go , good luck and i hope i can visit again .

  no probs , these things happen with bigger news items , we get a ton of submissions from different outlets  good for inflating my mod actions count though !, 
  we have swiss election live thread , you can find it stickied at the top of the page . 
  honestly , i do n't touch pun threads when they are in good humour . 
  i came down on this one because it looks to be from a troll account ( low activity , negative karma , plenty of posts like that ) and because it 's really shitty ( not even a pun ) . 
  it was good way to send a message that some * minimum * standard of effort is expected .
