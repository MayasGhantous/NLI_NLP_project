  when it says [ deleted ] , it means the user deleted it himself . 
  a mod-removed post would say [ removed ] .

  media has been strangely slow to pick it up , so we got first the stories of local german media and then a lot of people posting it from international media . 
  it 's just how these things happen ,

   at no point have the mods ever banned anyone for having a different opinion [ my fucking sides  ( https://archive.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1385/86/1385869824757.jpg )  so for example , if someone posts non stop about how awesome jews are , and why we need to support israel and jews above all else , and pretty much all of their comment history consists of that , then under this system we would give this user an israeli flag , and make their flair say `` jidf shill '' . 
  this is literally your new policy . 
  you are going to put stars of david on anyone who does n't agree with your antisemitic circlejerk . 
  yeah you wo n't ban anyone , you 'll just point them out for instant downvoting . 
  get the fuck out of here m8 .

   yup , just like we are concerned about the people in north korea with their concentration camps or like the tibetans by the chinese or all the africans under bad regimes or ... 
  this is exactly right , all of these people qualify for asylum and eritreans in particular represent a very significant percentage of the arrivals in italy .
