   the right of members of this house to be able to represent their constituents without fear or favour is intrinsic to our democracy . 
  the right to live without fear or favour based on dragnet surveillance should belong to everyone , not just mps . 
  the alacrity with which an emergency debate was called when their privacy was at stake contrasts markedly with the relative disinterest surrounding increasingly invasive surveillance in the uk , and exposes the hypocrisy of the `` if you 've nothing to hide , you have nothing to fear '' : they do n't believe it when it applies to themselves . 
  we take bribes in rare pepes , posting them publicly is cause for permabanning and we will ask reddit admins to shadowban you for crashing the market . 
  if you want to bring up how immigration affects a certain topic in an op not about immigration , that 's fine , but actually make an argument . 
  one-line low effort remarks about it in unrelated threads will be removed . 
  / r/europe is n't a meta subreddit . 
  if you dislike another sub and want to talk about it , you need to find some other place for that .

   school should prepare you for finding a job . 
  i strongly disagree : school should ** also ** prepare you for finding a job , but a job is not the ultimate goal of life , to which there is much more . 
  school should give you the education necessary to be a complete individual and member of society : you should have both knowledge , skills , and the mental habits necessary to rationally rapport yourself with the world in all its facets . 
  since this was n't clear from the title , i think it 's important to point out that the guy attacked four other people too :  according to a spokesman , reker was set upon by an individual wielding a knife who also attacked four other people at the scene , including a man - beleived to have been a part of reker 's campaign team - who was also seriously hurt . 
   how do they not get that this stuff just drives the moderates away from their cause ? 
  i 'm guessing the guy going on a knifing spree while loudly shouting his motive was n't in the habit of thinking things through all that much . 
  would n't surprise me if he employed some liquid courage beforehand either .

   the main argument is that our school are more difficult than the ones of most of the countries and it 's not even true to be honest . 
  the difficulty here is more convoluteness than challenge ; it does n't push people to better themselves through learning , it teaches them how to play the system . 
  i 've seen other school systems challenge their students much more , even with a less difficult curriculum .

  the italian one is stiff and archaic , but it still holds itself together . 
  what it lacks sorely is sufficient staff and modern teaching techniques , we are still essentially stuck in the 60s in terms of mentality and organization . 
  too much frontal teaching , too little discussion ( essentially none to be honest ) , too little lab work with too little equipment , and a curriculum that could use major revision ( not everyone needs to study 5 years of latin and 3 years of divine comedy , the second is just insane ) .

   409k in 40 days is 3.7 million per year . 
  this is still bad extrapolation , but slightly less so , you can feel slightly less bad about it . 
  but seriously , linearly extrapolating a highly non-linear phenomenon is a bad idea .
