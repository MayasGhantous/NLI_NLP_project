  yes , i saw that from the other comments ; i simply relayed which part of the italian curriculum a test like this would fit into , 
  the typical student will be 18 during the last year of high school . 
  the italian education system is divided in 5 years elementary , 3 years middle and 5 years high school . 
  high school is broadly divided into liceo ( designed to prepare people for university ) and a variety of alternatives which range from professional schools to vocational training . 
  generally speaking , only in liceo would you study differential analysis of the kind required to immediately attack the op 's test .

  the math behind the problem is standard 5th-year liceo math in italy , just a simple minimization problem . 
  we would usually just give a function and ask the student to find extremal and inflection points , behaviour at the edges of the domain and other similar things , solved with simple analysis .

  from the op :  public bnr radio cited ministry sources as saying that the group of 48 illegal migrants from afghanistan was armed and aggressive and refused to obey an order by the bulgarian border guards to stop and turn back . 
    the man was either wounded by a ricochet when police fired warning shots in the air or he was directly shot at , the radio said . 
    the ministry has not confirmed the report .

   sorry , do you have some evidence that more men than women are raped outside of the prison system in the us ? 
  there 's no reason to exclude prison rape from this statistic . 
   it 's not like normal hospitals refuse male rape victims ? 
  this is a specialization a specialization that was just as needed as it was for women , and which was sadly absent . 
   nothing worse than a nagging woman while you are trying to jihad .
