   taking her children into isis territory though , i 'd call irresponsible `` irresponsible '' is a bit of an understatement . 
  it 's an active warzone , even if you believe isis is the islamic version of the rotary club voluntarily taking your children in there is insane . 
  i do n't understand how you can suppress parental instinct like that , even in the name of deeply-held religious beliefs . 
  you can not solve an issue with poor language skills and maladaption to the german technical professions pipeline by lowering standards ( which is what fast-tracking training would amount to ) and recognizing foreign qualifications which you previously would n't . 
  language courses and orientation into the functioning of the local system are the only possible treatments . 
  culture clash is a manageable problem , but a problem which requires solution , not accomodation .

  hypocritical predatory european policies in africa are not about immigration , they are about patting ourselves on the back while fucking over africa once more . 
  this has nothing to do with immigration and refugees . 
  refugees are fleeing from beheading in syria and iraq and orwellian repression in eritrea . 
  these people need help , there is no skepticism . 
  they need camps the other side of the med that are safe and dignified so they do n't kill themselves crossing while enriching the bellies of criminal terrorist networks . 
  immigration is about immigration . 
  the choice of people to resettle somewhere better or more suited to their hopes and needs . 
  going to africa and actively enticing people to come over here while at the same time fucking over the continent with commercial policies that are barely better than colonialism is n't about that , it 's about hypocrisy and selling a nicer kind of immigrant to the voters at home . 
  so yeah i 'm against this . 
  it 's predation masked as philantropy . 
  sounds like a good plan , what africa needs is for its most educated , talented and enterprising people to be enticed to emigrate , they do n't already do that enough on their own . 
  i `` crept '' through your profile because i wanted to see if your submission had been actually approved , since there was some confusion with two mods acting at once . 
  a removed submission would n't show up in the / new / queue , so i had to go to your profile to check , 
  maybe give us a few minutes to reply to your very confusing message in modmail before going off to tell people that we acted incoherently ,
