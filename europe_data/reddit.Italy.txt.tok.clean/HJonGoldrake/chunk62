  i actually did read the article and yes , there is opinion in the title you chose . 
  the contention around this event is whether the guys were illegally distributing a book or were merely showing it to people who subsequently asked for a copy on their own . 
  putting only their version in the title is textbook editorialization .

   i love the simplicity of our law-making system . 
  the procedure for reforming the constitution is much more complex than that for regular laws , it 's not representative of our parliamentary system at all . 
  it was drafted that way for newborn republic coming out of a bi-decennial dictatorship , and was intended to guarantee that the constitution could n't be changed too easily or too quickly so as to prevent a new autocrat from forcing changes through .

   some in the crowd waved hungarian and russian flags and chanted `` merkel to siberia , putin to berlin . '', 
  they are not even trying to hide it . 
  they do n't give a fuck about protecting european values of freedom and democracy , that 's just an excuse to get rid of muslims . 
  they 'd welcome a literal autocrat if it was a right-wing one .
