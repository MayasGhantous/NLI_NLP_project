  but the will of the people , so far as we know , is being respected . 
  in countries which are strongly opposed to immigration the governments are strongly opposed to immigration . 
  in countries where the population was in favour of taking in refugees , refugees were taken in . 
  the public opinion in germany is shifting and its government 's policy is responding accordingly . 
  if there is an issue in which popular will and policy align closely , it is this . 
  some people repeatedly mistake `` popular will '' for `` what i think should be done '' or `` what the opinionate minority i belong to thinks is best for the country '' , but that is a problem that can only be solved by themselves opening their eyes . 
   is it too insane to say it is so not insane that this is the mainstream position in all of europe , and no one is advocating that we throw open the borders and welcome immigrants with the same alacrity with which we must help refugees . 
  what i find insane is the constant repetition that this position is somehow in the minority , when it is instead in the absolute majority . 
   the facility is ready for startup tests and will get a first shipment of lng from qatar between dec. 11 and dec. 17 to cool the plant , with commercial deliveries starting in 2016 , two years later than initially planned . 
  not that the qatari government is particularly nice , but at least it does n't have a habit of using gas and gas prices to strongarm their neighborhood .
