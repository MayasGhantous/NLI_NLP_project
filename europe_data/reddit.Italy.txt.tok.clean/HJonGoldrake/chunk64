   citing a lack of monetary resources to sustain a livelihood for the coming weeks another example of what inevitably happens when your policy is `` this is n't happening this is n't happening this is n't happening ok it 's happening they are all here let 's do this '' . 
  this sort of issue with insufficent resources being allocated insufficiently fast is going to become more and more prominent the more the big surge settles in and the more they start needing lodging , registration and all other services connected to the asylum seeker status . 
  please review rule [ 1.1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) and consider this a final warnign . 
  there are plenty of reasons why the eu is calling on russia to stop the bombing . 
  the most immediate one is diplomatic posturing . 
  the eu knows very well that russia wo n't listen to it and that this is an empty call , but it 's doing it anyway because it needs to play a few angles : showing that it 's aligned with washington 's policy of opposing russian intervention , starting to put it into print that russia 's bombing is wrong and the good guys are condemning it , preparing for when it inevitably emerges that russia has killed some civilians and the eu can say `` we asked them to stop weeks ago '' . 
  below that are the actual reasons why the eu is opposing russian intervention . 
  for the last few years , the natosphere has had a syria policy of supporting a part of the rebellion against assad , in order to topple the regime ( which has historical ties to russia , beside being a bunch of scumbags ) . 
  russia is instead propping up assad and attacking his opposition . 
  in this context , russia is not only reasserting its role in syria ( a strategic region bordering western allies ) , but it 's also ruining years of effort by the natosphere to support the rebellion . 
  finally , assad 's victory would ensure that a large number of syrian refugees currently in the eu would never return home . 
  assad maintained a measure of stability , but he was a brutal dictator who turned the army against the civilian population in massacres , and of course was n't exactly a strong promoter of civil liberties and democracy . 
  many syrians wo n't return home if assad is in power , meaning they will have to be long-term immigrants in europe , something that many governments would rather not deal with .

  camping in the cold is n't a problem . 
  long term tent cities are a problem . 
  large tent cities in the cold are an additional problem . 
  the ground turns to muck , especially with many people walking all over . 
  hygiene becomes a challenge . 
  sweden is wealthy country and has the resources to handle this , but this wo n't be trivial and it could and should have been avoided .

  france did n't so much surrender as it was defeated and turned into a puppet state . 
  collaborationists set up a pro-nazi government , and exiles reconstituted a government in exhile and mustered whatever force was available to fight against nazi forces , leading to a significant french military presence in many theaters . 
  armed resistance to the occupation and to the collaborationist regime continued throughout the war . 
  italy did n't so much switch sides as it split into two factions , which subsequently fought a civil war within the context of wwii . 
  the house of savoy and the government loyal to it signed an armistice with the allies and declared war on nazi germany , forming a government in southern italy , while mussolini and his fascists formed a nazi-puppet government in northern italy . 
  mass armed resistance against the nazifascist forces sprang up during this period , made up of a mix of communists , monarchists , catholics , liberals and pretty much everyone who was n't a fascist . 
  eheh , i did have a lot of fun hunting down that book , and this is definitely a nice thread . 
  we talked with andrty89 via modmail after he messaged us . 
  despite your rabid conviction to the contrary , the mod team is not personally accountable to you . 
  if you wish to discuss the present rules , please post to / r/europemeta ( where this specific discussion has been had more than once , including recently ) . 
  i understand that feeling . 
  in general , anglophone media has a way of viewing things through a strongly coloured lens and everything that the lens does n't pass through is ignored . 
  this results in the all-too-typical ethnographic pieces about `` how weird x european country is because they do this or that '' , which are common to the point of being disheartening . 
  in this case , i agree that this article makes a very weak and incredibly biased case against the french university system . 
  there are excellent universities in france , and while they do have problems they are hardly those described in the article . 
  please review rule [ 1.1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ), 
   and i can assure to you that the average student of ecole polytechnique , ecole normale sup\u00e9rieure , ecole nationale d'administration etc. 
  would tear a new asshole to the best of the student of the ivy league . 
  this sort of dickwaving is stupid . 
  i spent a trimester at ens paris in physics and of course everyone there is very very good , but they are not some set of otherworldly beings . 
  at that level , the difference is made by the particular student , and the degree of specialization is such that most students could mutually tear each other new ones in their respective disciplines . 
  i 've known people who went or went on to go to world-class universities like ens paris , ethz , oxbridge , a good friend of mine at stanford . 
  they were all really smart people , really good in their fields , but what institute they went made practically no difference in how intelligent , dedicated and skilled they were . 
  like i said , at that level you are already as good of a general student as it gets , and how much better you are after that is entirely up to you , not to your school . 
  i find that most people who went to this sort of institution share this opinion . 
  i suggest making a self-post compiling such instances , or posting an article about anti-roma racism .

   first of all , to ensure there is accommodation . 
  the standards are being lowered . 
  it 's a matter of providing roof over heads . 
  this is exactly what happens when you have a giant phenomenon on your doorstep and you refuse to acknowledge it and prepare for it in any way for years . 
  italy and greece spent two years asking europe to get its shit together . 
  the rest of europe kept considering it a border states issue , just a matter of handling a slightly increased amount of asylum seekers . 
  now we are at the point of putting people in tent cities in northern europe with winter at the doors . 
  we could have handled this so much sooner . 
  we could have started talking to turkey about paying for more local camps years ago . 
  we could have had all these meetings about what to do years ago , and decided on a plan , any plan , instead of turning this into an emergency at the last second . 
  instead , because of the usual divisiveness and self-centered disinterest , we spent two years pretending the problem did n't exist , until it burst down our doors . 
  and now everyone , including the asylum seekers , is going to suffer much more than necessary .
