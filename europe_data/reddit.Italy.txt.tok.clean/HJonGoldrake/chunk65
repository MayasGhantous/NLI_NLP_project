  this is not an unreasonable amount of effort to request . 
  like i said , your itunes link was filtered , which means it was removed automatically as all itunes links are . 
  same with buzzfeed . 
  i reiterate that if you want to talk about a book , please make a self-post and explain why you think it 's interesting , or submit an article that talks about it ( like the one you just linked to me from pulitzercenter.org ) i 'll inquire into why your youtube video was removed , but understand that this might take some time . 
   i 'll rather not bother which is exactly why this is a low effort post and has been removed . 
  it leaves us where you can submit that video , or a report about that interview , from a source that does n't try to twist it . 
  your itunes submission was filtered because we do n't allow advertisement . 
  if you think a particular book is interesting or relevant , please instead make a self post about it explaining why . 
  your buzzfeed submission was filtered because we do n't allow articles from buzzfeed , which is a sensationalistic low-quality outlet . 
  if you want to counter negative views on refugees , please choose from the bounty of content available from reputable sources . 
  no , you ca n't submit youtube videos with titles that stitch together parts of a long interview into a single quote to sensationalize it .

  guys , the banter is super-fun , but try to keep out the out the `` gilipollas '' eh ? 
  no , it 's not an automated message , i typed it out myself . 
  a multiple-dozen-page manual without any further commentary is indeed a low-effort post . 
  like i said , please make a self-post explaining why you think this is interesting ; i would encourage you to point out which parts of this long document you think are particularly important to read , for example . 
  trying to get around the domain blacklist is a quick way to get banned . 
   `` the metropolitan police service has to balance the interests of justice in this case with the ongoing risks to the safety of londoners and all those we protect , investigating crime and arresting offenders wanted for serious offences , in deciding what a proportionate response is , '' it added . 
  this is a very polite , british way to say `` this is bollocks , get your secret service on the case if you want to get this guy , we have real work to do '' . 
   it 's a mixed economy , and not pure capitalism . 
  which parts of the economy are run without a market , commodity production , wage labour and the other hallmarks of capitalism ? 
  meh , the anglo-norman language of william the conqueror was much more similar to modern french than modern english . 
  modern english has only about 28 % of its vocabulary originating from the various french languages of the time .

  no , this is the commission . 
  as far as i know there is no case pending before the ecj regarding tax deals . 
  i do n't see why any of that would stop you . 
  scaring cats off of places where they should n't be is pretty much the only way to stop them going there . 
   is it for some reason necessary to have 2 stickied posts at all times ? 
  i would n't say so , it 's a recently added feature and we are looking at how to use it . 
  feedback is important and much appreciated , 
  because it extracts and sensationalizes a single data point unrepresentative of even its local neighborhood , as the article itself confirms :  the total is higher than in recent days , with daily totals over the previous week averaging around 5,500, 
   the group was waving a black flag which , a member has admitted , looks a bit like the isis emblem [ isis has taken to the seas !, 
  ] ( https://img0.etsystatic.com/000/0/5132637/il_fullxfull.84512208.jpg )  terror police in sweden have been called to reports of a group of bearded men in dark clothes raising a black flag above a remote castle . 
  that 's indeed terrifying , i can see why they called the terror police . 
   and while the group might have looked menacing from a distance , when they got closer police found around 30 young men hugging and laughing dressed in formal clothes , not militant garb . 
  they are just trying to blend in you fools !, 
   `` after about an hour the police showed up , '' he said . 
  `` they told us they got a call from someone driving past on the highway , saying that there were isis terrorists at the ruins . 
  i want the recording of that phone call . 
   `` we had a laugh with the police and they left , '' he said . 
  `` it was a surreal experience . '' they should have taken pictures with the police and texted them back to the original caller with `` we know . 
  they are nice . '', 
  [ the eu is actually investigating individual tax deals in 15 countries .

  & gt ; tfw you are third to last only above dead languages why ca n't italia into relevant ? 
  seriously though , italian is spoken of course in italy , in the italian part of switzerland , and has some amount of influence in parts of the balkans ( albania , for example , iirc ) . 
  there are few things in which knowledge of italian is necessary ( for example roman archaeology and arts history ) , but unfortunately i do n't think it 's a very objectively relevant language today .
