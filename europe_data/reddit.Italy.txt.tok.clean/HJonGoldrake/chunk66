  useful in what terms ? 
  the business world at the top levels deals in english , although speaking the local language is still an assett . 
  in stem fields , english is likewise a de-facto lingua franca . 
  in law and the humanities , local languages are still much more prominent . 
  but beside these career-related metrics , speaking a language has other uses . 
  you might be interested in the cultural production in one language , in which case of course learning it would be invaluable . 
  and if you plan to live in a european country , there 's no substitute for speaking the local language if you do n't want to eternally be just an expat .

  uh , i thought you had given up on that argument because you realized it does n't make sense ? 
  that 's not how statistics work , at all . 
  if there are 6 million muslims in europe , that absolutely and categorically does not mean that muslims in one part of europe will be similar to muslims in another part of europe . 
  since this could easily turn into a long and imprecise discussion i 'll cut to the chase : which statistical theorem do you think supports your assertion ? 
   according to some statistics floating about which statistics ?

  you can stay adamant to whatever you prefer , but this community is regulated by rules that apply to you as well . 
  racist language is not acceptable here . 
  it has been explained to you , and you have officially been warned about it . 
   so why do you assume that muslims in denmark are monoliths compared to other countries ? 
  i literally do the opposite . 
  there 's probably a language barrier regarding the figurative use of the term ` monolith ' here . 
   assuming muslims differ significantly between developed european countries seems illogical to me . 
  would you assume that christians do n't differ significantly between developed european countries ? 
  muslims are n't some sort of monolith , they are subject to the same differences in local culture , background , theological movements and so on as any other religious group . 
  yes , this the op , a poll in denmark . 
  it 's not `` every single look at the younger muslims '' . 
  taking a poll in one country and turning it into a sweeping generalization about all muslims is illogical in the extreme . 
   every single look at the younger muslims shows them to be more religious than their parents . 
  really ? 
  i 'd like to see some data on that .

  syrians are not even in the top 10 nationalities arriving in italy , because of course they take the much shorter route through greece . 
  we did still get [ 130 000 migrants ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/country.php?id=105 ) in the first 9 months of 2015 . 
  migrants which never reach our shores on their own , but are always in need of rescue in the high seas , must be brought to sicily first and then relocated throughout our territory from that island , which makes it more complicated than in mainland europe . 
  the first mention of a green , white and red flag is in a document of cherasco , piedmont , from napoleon 's 1796 invasion ; though a later correction amended that to blue , white and red , the colors of revolutionary france , so it 's possible that the french flag had been raised to welcome the french troops and the colors noted down incorrectly . 
  the first official establishment of the colors of the italian flag as an actual government flag was in bologna later that same year , where it was officially declared the national flag ( of the local government , which did n't last very long ) .
