  the flag was subsequently used by various revolutionary governments and national unification groups in a long and multiform struggle towards a unified italy . 
  finally , it was taken up by the kingdom of sardinia , the precursor state of modern italy , with the heraldry of the house of savoy superimposed on the white . 
  when the kingdom of sardinia became the kingdom of italy , the flag was adopted as the national flag . 
  after wwii , when italy voted to become a republic , the savoy heraldry was removed and the flag restored to its original simple green , white and red .

  please review rule [ 1.2 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ), 
   despite russia being rather insignificant economically insignificant compared to what ? 
  because we are not talking about how russia incredibly manages to bully economies much larger than itself , we are talking about how it manages to bully economies which are much , much smaller . 
  the book is by a norwegian anthropologist , i do n't think for us laymen it gets more authoritative than that . 
  it 's an appropriate source , you can use it . 
  by the way , that book is the wikipedia reference , it 's the one right before the [ citation needed ] ,

   its interesting how much power russia has over its neighbors since its economy is 400billion less than the state of california . 
  estonia has an economy a third smaller than vermont , belarus has an economy slightly smaller than west virginia , ukraine slightly smaller than kentucky . 
  russia dwarfs its neighbors in economic and military size , and has done so for a long time . 
  not unsurprising that it has so much influence on them . 
  please review rule [ 1.1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) and consider this a final warning .

  wikipedia by itself no , but if you look the actual reference is exactly to the exact kind of book i just mentioned  i suggest you resubmit this either with that source added in the picture or , if you think it does n't fit graphically , as a comment . 
  i 'll approve it ( or , if it gets removed , message me and i 'll re-approve it ) . 
  the first example would be a publication that collected and documented the origin stories of the various flags and related legends . 
  i know it 's a nice little tidbits , but the way it is now it 's a forwardsfromgrandma piece ,

   the number was confirmed from other sources no , it was n't , as your article confirms . 
  die welt says it believes it 's possible , and lorenz caffier from the local government says it was his personal opinion ( not an estimate , not an expert opinion ) that it 's possible . 
  neither of these is in any way a confirmation that 1.5 million was anything but a discredited estimate pushed by a tabloid . 
   there is an analogy in the principle of the suit . 
  yes , but how far the boundaries of the law can be pushed has no bearing on whether i think i should accept the suit is not bogus . 
  it is bogus , even if the law allowes them to file it .
