  i mean , if we want to go by the principle of it , pm had to pretend it was a company based in hong kong to even file it , so it 's evident that whether a suit can be filed has little relation to reality . 
  so danes worry whether they are racist , if the netherlands are nordic enough , if lithuania is cheap and if we are indeed in europe . 
  and yes danes , we are . 
  you even came boating down here all those years ago , remember ? 
   i am not trying to discredit the numbers themselves . 
  they show the number of registered migrants who were interviewed and asked about their nationality , their age etc no , once again : the italian numbers are the off-the-boat headcount . 
   this is not just about italy , but also about greece . 
  i have little knowledge of the procedures in greece , so i ca n't comment on them ; i do know how we do it in italy , so i can comment on that .

   pm is claiming that australia is expropriating their trademark the fact that they are claiming it does n't mean i have to accept their bullshit and argue as if it were factual . 
  pm is n't being expropriated of anything , hence why there is n't any analogy here . 
   do you agree that companies should be compensated for expropriation of their legally acquired assets , even if it is done as part of an otherwise righteous and important law ? 
  well , no , i 'm a communist , of course i do n't agree with the principle of compensating companies for expropriation . 
  but , to get to actual meaning of your question which i do get : under the present economic system i think some form of compensation for expropriation should exist , but i 'm not particularly worried about how fair it is to foreign multinationals . 
   they are willing to ignore eu law , so why should we trust them that their `` headcounts '' are accurate ? 
  because the headcount is necessary to know how many busses must be called to the dock to take the migrants to the first processing center , and to know to which processing centers to send them based on free capacity . 
   they are unreliable and the difference to the 1.5 million german number you are trying to discredit official italian interior ministry numbers produced with a credible methodology but take a discredited anonymous estimate published by a bullshit tabloid as completely factual . 
  i am in utter awe of the mental gymnastics .

  you are making 3 mistakes : - the italian numbers are a police headcount , not interview-based . 
  interviews are used later to determine nationality . 
  - the numbers on the unhcr site are up to september 2015 , not all of 2015 as you incorrectly assume ; it does n't make sense to compare them to total 2015 estimates - germany 's total number ( which is not 1.5 million , that 's a discredited bild ` leak ' that people need to stop using ) is n't made up of just the mediterranean route , but also a large number of balkan migrants,

  syria is n't the only country afflicted by war , and it 's not the only country from which legitimate refugees originate .

   in the end it does n't really matter , because in practice it is very hard to get 1/3 of national parliaments to object something that has been agreed . 
  at the moment , national parliaments could object , but it would be essentially futile , which certainly contributes to why they use the yellow card system so little . 
  if it were turned into a veto power , i think it 's reasonable to think that this would change .

  removals are not moral condemnations on the actions of a poster . 
  this article was very low quality as it consisted of unconfirmed reports from the tweets of an unnamed turkish journalist , so in accordance with the rules it was removed . 
   such a system already kinda exists not really though . 
  the system we have is called `` yellow card '' system and it was n't for nothing that cameron named his request `` red card '' . 
  under the yellow card system , 1/3 of national parliaments can ask the eu to re-consider a directive , but they have no veto power over it . 
  under a red card system , 1/3 of national parliaments will have veto power on new eu directives and revision power over past ones . 
  cameron 's proposal is entirely different from the current system , even if based on the same spirit . 
   a new `` red card '' system to bring power back from brussels to britain . 
  this would give groups of national parliaments the power to stop unwanted directives being handed down and to scrap existing eu laws . 
  i agree , as soon as cameron passes a domestic law granting the same veto power to 1/3 of his councils and equivalent local authorities . 
  if what he truly wants is a deadlocked political process , he has to be coherent with this suicidal desire and implement it himself first . 
   a new structure for the eu itself . 
  the block of 28 nations must be reorganised to prevent the nine countries that are not in the eurozone being dominated by the 19 member states that are , with particular protections for the city of london . 
  i agree with this as well , with the same pre-condition : if cameron wants to be out of the eurozone but still have special powers to contain what its member states do in the eu arena , then the eurozone member states should have special powers to contain what the non-eurozone member states do . 
  is he ready to commit to this eurozone oversight ? 
  somehow i doubt it . 
  these proposals are excessive and boastful . 
  they look designed to give cameron a fight in terms of the inevitable scandalized declarations of some or other eu leader . 
  he can then go to negotation and obtain the passing of meaningless statement # 1 and # 2 ( to be spinned into great victories for britain 's independence ) , while getting a strengthening of the yellow card system ( essentially scrapping demand # 3 ) and some more concessions on financial regulation ( keeping the core interest of # 4 ) . 
  it 's a good first salvo that gives him maneuvering ground to play tough for the home audience while drawing a clear path towards achievable goals that should still be enough of a victory to keep the uk in the eu , which is definitely what cameron wants . 
  if he plays his cards right in the negotiation stage , which i 'm sure he will , he should be able to bring this home in time for the referendum and convince the uk to stay in .
