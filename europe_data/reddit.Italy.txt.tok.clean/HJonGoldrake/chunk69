   because the eu has no efficient border control in the countries where they first enter ( greece and italy ) it is not possible to even count them . 
  this is quite simply false . 
  migrants coming to italy exclusively come off the ships of our own navy and coast guard and those of other nations partecipating in triton . 
  they are counted as they come off , which why we know precisely how many people have entered italy . 
  the one clutching at straws is the person comparing a house to the right to put your trademark on cigarette packages . 
  if somebody takes away my house , that 's a loss of a tangible good that i already possessed ; if somebody takes away my ability to make more future profit that 's too bad , but nothing was taken from me that i already had . 
  a valid real estate analogy would be with a developer that is no longer allowed to put asbestos in his buildings because of new regulation : too bad , but he has n't and should n't have any right to compensation . 
  your first sentence is saying that the lawsuit was not about stopping plain packaging laws . 
  your last sentence is saying that the lawsuit was about stopping plain packaging laws . 
  i think you just made my point for me there . 
  your analogy is on the other hand inapplicable : my house is n't harming kids , unlike cigarettes .

   saying companies can sue government `` for protecting their youth '' is extremely misleading what 's misleading is cutting out the rest of that sentence , which was `` protect youth from cigarette marketing images '' . 
  which is literally ** exactly ** what was being done : protect youth from cigarette marketing which would induce them to start smoking . 
   firstly , the basis of that suit is not health regulation per se but expropriation of a trademark . 
  we do n't have to dance to the tune of lawyerspeak . 
  the lawsuit was to stop plain packaging laws . 
  the legal basis for it was that plain packaging laws removed the company 's trademark - ** which is the entire point of the law ** , since the plainness of the package is exactly what you want to achieve . 
   secondly , the suit has little chance of success , it is mostly a tactical move from philip morris . 
  philip morris has spent tens of millions of dollars on a tactical move with little chance of success . 
  why ? 
  please review rule [ 1.2 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ), 
   if every step is exposed to the media people will protest against some propositions of which they probably know nothing about this keeps being brought up and it keeps making absolutely no sense . 
  people know nothing about most things that their own parliaments legislate about , but draft laws are public for everyone to see . 
  that 's because we do n't live in a technocracy , we live in a democracy : democratic review of the actions of our governments is fundamental . 
  transparency , education and a functioning press are all necessary to make this review possible and meaningful ; if people do n't know enough about a topic to meaningfully talk about it , the solution is n't to take it away from them , it 's to educate them . 
   suing governments through a tribunal for such offenses as trying to protect youth from cigarette marketing images fear mongering bullshit my ass , this literally already happened . 
  philip-morris used the australia-hong kong trade agreement to reincorporate in hong kong and sue australia for its plain packaging laws .

  not really , we have a representative democracy because for the vast majority of the history of modern democracy it has been technically impossible to even attempt letting every elector vote on every law , and it remains difficult to this day . 
  but even in a representative democracy , it remains absolutely fundamental that the electorate is informed of the activities of the government and understand them as much as possible . 
  transparency , education and a functioning press are fundamentals of a functioning democracy . 
  how would twitter get overloaded in turkey but not elsewhere ? 
   the vast majority of people do n't even understand ttip the vast majority of people do n't understand most laws that are passed by their own parliaments , but the solution to that is n't to suspend democracy , it 's to make it more transparent , educated people better and promote a vibrant political discourse where journalists and experts can help bridge the knowledge gap . 
  i have update the flair in this post to reflect this correction . 
  thank you for this very valuable contribution . 
  well , first of all , it 's a giant trade deal that will impact a lot of way in which our economies are run . 
  that establishes it 's importance . 
  proponents of the ttip argue that the deal will boost the economies of the us and europe , raising trade , removing bureaucratic red tape and enabling the full potential of transatlantic trade to boom . 
  opponents of the ttip argue that a deal of this magnitude should n't be negotiated in secret ( it is being negotiated in secret ) , that its positive effects have been vastly overplayed and may well not exist and that provisions inserted into the deal ( which have been gleaned at through multiple leaks ) threaten national sovereignity and in effect would allow corporate interests to impose their will in the name of protecting investment .

  your post is literally a kneejerk reaction to seeing a demonstration against ttip , founded upon literally nothing but what you assume are the motivations of these demonstrators . 
  you are literally engaging in the exact same behaviour that you are decrying .

  you can make green lasagna , which is lasagna where the pasta is made with the addition of spinach . 
  fairly widespread , very delicious . 
   cr\u00e8me anglaise that looks nothing like crema pasticcera , which is much thicker and also requires corn starch ( or flour ) and often cream . 
  in fact , crema inglese is crema pasticcera without corn starch , making it much more liquid . 
  i 've had to share meals with someone who was on a whole grains diet for a while , and i 've found that at least for italian cuisine you can replace whole grains pasta in practically every dish with little issue . 
  the only ones where i 've found it impossible are the dishes that require freshly made pasta like tortellini , where i could n't find a recipe using whole grain flour that gave the requisite softness to it . 
   even if they are told that these people are genuine refugees but this can not be reliably checked . 
  sure it can .
