  the morality of contemporary europe does n't stem from religion , it stems from opposition to religion . 
  the values of the enlightenment were created in a struggle against the backwardness and obscurantism of religious-based morality ; the very idea of freedom of religion , a pillar of modern society , was created * precisely * in opposition to prevalent religious values . 
  those forms of christianity which have survived in europe have had to abandon more and more of their old tenets because society surpassed them * against their own opposition * . 
  and there is no clearer contemporary example of how modern european values are largely opposed to christian values than gay rights . 
  nearly every christian confession in europe , and especially the catholic church , is vehemently against recognizing rights such as marriage and adoption to gay people . 
  so no , your argument that modern europe is in any way founded upon christian values is completely baseless . 
  modern europe is founded upon opposition to christian values and has forced christianity to become a somewhat less backwards religion , not the other way around . 
  but your culture is also slavic and post-communist , they said : you have no respect or interest in civil liberties , you have no work ethic , you are proud and violently so , you get drunk at every opportunity and become even more violent , and your christianity only leads you to be ultra conservative and backwards . 
  your arguments boils down to this extraordinary belief : that every other time that a cultural incompatibility threshold was affirmed as ultimate and unsurmountable , people have been wrong , but * this time * they are right . 
  this time we 've found the real , legit , correct thing that makes us unable to live together , and it 's islam . 
  this one is the right one , even if we 've been wrong every other time despite the same exact arguments . 
  does this seem like an argument that can be sustained to you ? 
  nope , the cool kids eat at cool hipstery hamburger places like [ well done . 
  ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/07/75/85/e5/meta-fissa-a-bologna.jpg ), 
  were our xenophobes correct in resolutely believing that eastern european immigrants would be a plague upon our society due to incompatible backwards culture , drunkness , violence , criminality and lack of work ethic ? 
   maybe in the rural south ? 
  where in the rural south can you even find a mcdonalds ? 
  mcdonalds is a city chain , not a rural backwards place chain ( are there any ? ) . 
  besides , there are far , far more mcdonalds in the north of italy than in the south . 
   i do n't understand why would you think i agree with the second sentence . 
  because you have refused to engage with that argument for this entire discussion ; since i do n't want to assume you are running away from having to admit you are wrong , i must conclude that you actually agree with it . 
   yep , many restaurants in italy do n't even have pizza . 
  i 'd say most restaurants by far in italy do n't have pizza . 
  pizza is , well , for pizzerias , it 's a specialized type of food that requires properly trained pizzaioli and infrastructure .

   but well , it could use moar meat plenty of meat in our repertoire , you only need to pick the meat-based dishes . 
  rag\u00f9 alla bolognese is a heavily meat-based sauce , and one of the most popular ; a fiorentina steak is perhaps the best known t-bone type steak in italy , and absolutely delicious . 
  mix those two and you 've already got yourself a god-tier meat menu :d, 
   can you provide me with an article on eastern european terrorist attack in western europe ? 
  wait , is this the only point of distinction you recognize ? 
  do you agree with our xenophobes of the day that eastern europeans are drunk , violent , backwards people who want to laze about all day , not get a job and do n't respect us or our values ? 
  and again , the same shit was said about eastern european immigrants : they fought amongst themselves , they created their own ghetto communities , they were violent , criminal , perpetually drunk , unwilling to get a job , far too easily offended and quick to anger , too religiously conservative etc. 
  you can keep ignoring my argument if you want , but it does n't mean that i have to keep entertaining you by trying to get you to reply to it instead of going off on your own tangent . 
   as far as i know pkk is mulsim right ? 
  pkk stands for partiya karker\u00ean kurdistan , kurdistan 's workers party . 
  they are a socialist political and military organization , thouroughly secular . 
  you missed the point entirely : nobody wants to kick poles out now , nor eastern europeans . 
  despite the hyperbolic fear-mongering when they first started immigrating , they have integrated very well , hell i have a ukrainian cousin-in-law myself . 
  the point is that ` cultural incompatibility ' is a meaningless concept whose threshold is set by people precisely short of whichever group they do n't want in their country today . 
  it used to be the case that eastern europeans were considered culturally incompatible and people believed it just as strongly as they believe it today of muslim immigrants , and it seemed to them just as obvious . 
  hell even moroccan immigrants were spoken about in the same terms of today 's refugees , and now people here hail them as the ` good immigrant ' kind because they settled down , got jobs , sent their kids to school and went on by and large to be just regular people . 
   and we happened to be similar culturally workforce for europe ? 
  when polish immigration was a thing , our domestic xenophobes were using the same arguments they are using about immigrants now : conservative to the point of barbarism , violent , uncivilized , do n't speak the language , undereducated compared to us , do n't want to integrate but just send money home etc. 
  the ` cultural compatibility threshold ' is on a sliding scale that xenophobes move based on the latest target of their hatred . 
  eastern europeans used to be depicted as utter animals , now they are our brothers in christianity compared to muslim immigrants . 
  i do n't doubt that if we ever got significant chinese immigration , muslims would turn out to be our brothers in abrahamitic faith who have shared millennia of history with us compared to those alien orientals . 
  the flag is that of emilia-romagna , thankfully too small to be able to see how silly it is . 
  secretly britbong refers to my current residence through a dank meme that i can only encourage you to google . 
   interestingly , the uk has a flat tax on wine , # 2.05 ( $ 3.14 ) per 75cl bottle . 
  so that 's why cheap wine is overpriced here and the dirt cheap brands like tavernello boxed wine never make it to the shelves ...
