  it 's undisputed fact in england . 
  undisputed by such prestigious sources as `` hoaxorfact.com '' , `` bbncommunity.com '' , an anonymous forum post on `` ireport.cnn.com '' ( not verified by cnn ) , `` ixdaily.com '' ... need i got on ? 
  because that 's what your link shows : not a single legitimate news source . 
  if this is `` undisputed '' in england , where are the articles by the telegraph or the spectactor ? 
  surely they are not left-wing publications bent on defending political correctness .
