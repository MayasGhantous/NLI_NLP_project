   we migrate legally and fully assimilate into host country . 
  if you asked our xenophobes a few years ago , and really even today , they would tell you that eastern europeans came here to booze about , do nothing , bother the women , not learn the language , and get expelled only to come back later . 
  balkan immigrants and later romanians were the subject of a ton of prejudice of this sort when they were immigrating in large numbers . 
  over an expenses row , having his entire party set against him , being an outsider in a city that 's been ruled for decades by tacit pacts that did n't want the boat rocked , refusing to collaborate with the system ... essentially being a general nuisance who dared try to clean up the mess that is rome 's administration . 
  i 'll wait and see what comes of these allegations , but it would n't surprise me if these ones turned out to be fake or overblown like many preceeding ones .

  you kept the same memey insult for which i removed your other comment . 
  you may remove it , in which case i will reinstate your comment . 
  we deal in tens of billions of euro in arms and oil with gulf states and pander to their oppressive regimes all the time ; i could only wish that the utter scandal and reprobation shown at this little instance would be equally as strong in those other cases . 
  this is how diplomacy works . 
  everything is arranged to please the guest when it is necessary , even in a hypocritical way . 
  you can find that disgusting ( i certainly do ) , but this example is not even close to being the biggest or most shameful one . 
  please review rule [ 2.5 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) and consider this a warning . 
  the article itself states that when a dignitary from dubai visited , a similarly nude statue was n't covered . 
  this is n't an example of being ashamed of ones own culture as it is an example of pandering to the idiosyncrasies of a visiting diplomat with which one hopes to do business . 
  there 's a place and a practical sense in doing that , even though i do n't particularly like the idea of covering up statues because someone is offended by nudity . 
  please review rule [ 2.5 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ),

  i 'd say commenting on the state of border nations based on what ` analysts ' suspect is a bit unfair . 
  italy has been calling for something like a eu border corps for years , i do n't see my government opposing it on the ground of protection of sovereignity . 
  of course it would most likely insist on having a larger role in the operations on our own border , but that is only sensible : a eu border corps would have to be tightly integrated with existing facilities and would need to rely on the local expertise and resources .

   here i was n't advocating pressing religions or ethnic minorities i think i get what you mean , but `` it 's better to slightly oppress minorities than let them walk all over you '' is still calling for the oppression of minorities in the most direct and literal way . 
  if this is n't what you meant please edit the comment accordingly and i 'll reinstate it . 
  edit : great , it 's back up again  also , we are not as ban-happy as popular tales would suggest , do n't worry , 
   this thread is a / r/worldnews level shitshow of racism , xenophobia , and uninformedness about the basic workings of politics & most democracies and the european union .
