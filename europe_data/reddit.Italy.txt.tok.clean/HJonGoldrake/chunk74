  the article is about the evolution of the show , its cast and the specifics of its story , as is natural for an article talking about the new season of a tv show . 
  like i said , this content is more suited for specifically themed subreddits like / r/television . 
  germany is indeed in europe , and plenty of media is filmed in europe and \\ or employs a european cast . 
  but unless the article in question has some specific relevance to europe ( which it does n't seem to me that it has ) , it is better suited for somewhere like / r/television .

  a factor in mexican illegals staying where they first enter is that two of the states on the border , california and texas , are also among the wealthiest states in the union ; that 's where the vast majority of mexicans go , rather than arizona or colorado .

   why do they care if we have their data ? 
  yes , that 's quite literally the reason behind the ecj ruling . 
   the nsa is the lifeblood of our security programs . 
  good for you , but we have no reason to sacrifice our privacy rights for the self-perception of security of the us intelligence community , or to make life easier for american companies that want to operate in europe . 
   europeans have nothing to fear as long as they 're not terrorists/enemies if the state . 
  sure we do . 
  we have everything to fear from a government that is not democratically accountable to us and which , inevitably and even very openly , puts the interests of america and americans above all others , which operates in a secretive manner , in spite of its own constitution , violating the rights of its own citizens just as much as those of foreigners . 
  i do n't put the convenience of american it multinationals above the security of my data . 
   so they used a completely legal mechanism the eu set up ? 
  how is it dodgy ? 
  how are they getting around the rulling as this story implies ? 
  there 's an entire second half of the article dedicated to answering these questions . 
  tl ; dr since the ruling is based on the fact that snowden revelations imply no data is safe on us servers , and since nothing in the alternative methods employed suggests that this problem is overcome by those methods , the ruling is being circumvented through dodgy methods . 
  the ttip is n't an absolute good that must be achieved at any price . 
  transparency in the negotiation process is necessary to ensure proper democratic discourse around an enormously important agreement . 
  releasing only the finalized text will mean that the public will have an enormously reduced chance to influence it , because it will be a package , all-or-nothing choice without possibility of changing specific clauses . 
  a large percentage of draft laws presented to parliaments also do n't result in anything and only represent some stance by a party . 
  they are still public , because the voters have a right to know what their elected representatives are officially proposing to do . 
  nope . 
  delete the insult and i 'll relist your comment . 
   if you believe there is such a thing as transparent negotiations , try to enforce them on your countries companies and see what happens . 
  i have higher standards of transparency for my governing institutions than i have for private companies negotiating deals between themselves . 
  activists are n't calling for every negotiator involved in the ttip to wear a microphone 24/7 , they just want to be able to see the drafts , exactly like it happens for laws and bills in their national parliaments .

  i 'd be nice if this :  german police estimates around 3.200.000 to 3.500.000 due to the many illegal crossings without registration . 
  and this :  therefore the estimate around 20 to 30 million refugees in the next ~ 10 years .

   school placement/choice is big in the uk and germany has segregation based on academic achievement . 
  except for charter schools in the us its `` you live there you go there . '', 
  segregation happens in the us as well when families choose were to establish themselves also based on the quality of the local schools . 
  your argument still does n't explain why the uk or german system would do less to promote integration than the us one . 
   they go to american schools , intermixed . 
  immigrants go to local schools in europe as well , where 's the difference ? 
   but both pairs of my grandparents refused to teach my parents any language but english because `` you 're americans '' teaching the local language is definitely fundamental , but why on earth would it be desirable for the children of immigrants to also not earn the language of their parents ? 
  good , what a fucking asshole . 
  i was seriously amazed that he would say that on national television ; while i 'm sure there are purulent sacks of this sort of thinking left all over , i expected they 'd learned to hide by now .

   `` 60 percent of austria 's electricity '' produced by wind and water by clarifying it 's energy and not electricity . 
  the most evident point of distinction , i would say , is energy consumption for automotive , which is almost entirely fossil-fuelled . 
  [ quick and shitty version ] ( http://imgur.com/6ko6scp ) there definitely seems to be some correlation between white neighborhoods and higher house prices , but it 's broken in many locations .

   emission tests in europe are unrealistic . 
  they are based on highly modified vehicle bodies that lower fuel consumption to levels that are not achievable in reality . 
  newly tested engines only need to be valid for the first 150,000 km ( in contrast , us cars have to meet emission thresholds for up to 240,000 km ) . 
  they are also subject to interferences from stakeholders ; the testing is not independent . 
  carmakers actually contract the tests to organizations themselves . 
  these organizations are commercial enterprises that compete for business . 
  i had no idea it was this bad . 
  i always took it for granted that official fuel consumption and emissions numbers would be best cases , but i thought it would be because the cars would be driven in the most efficient manner with brand-new engines and perfect maintenance . 
  testing the engines on modified bodies and contracting the testing to companies which are paid by the automakers themselves is complete and utter bullshit . 
  the testing should be done by a publicly-controlled facility and paid for by the automaker , on bodies that are within a small deviation from the various makes and models that the engine will be installed on . 
  sorry , i do n't know . 
  you might try something like / r/outoftheloop or a meta sub .
