  most grocery chains have a section or aisle dedicated to gluten free \\ allergen free \\ vegan \\ bio etc food . 
  specialized shops are also a thing , but in my personal experience not very common . 
  in most london caf\u00e9s you can find a gluten free and \\ or vegan option on the men\u00f9 , sometimes a fairly extensive one ; in many cases , even main menu items are gluten free ( gluten-free muffins are pretty ubiquitous ) . 
  personally , i know exactly one person who goes for gluten free stuff , and she actually has coeliac disease . 
  i do n't know anyone else who buys gluten free because they just think it 's healthier without any specific medical reason .

   however what do you expect ? 
  well , exceptations are a matter of realism , and in realistic terms i expected tsipras to make his best attempt at pushing for a better deal while trying to make the reversal of some of the nastier items of austerity a fait accompli , which mostly happened . 
   tsipras ' cousin became general secretary of international economics in the ministry of foreign affairs . 
  the brother of the minister of culture became advisor to the ministry of tourism . 
  the current head of parliament recieved child benefits until she was 37 . 
  without context or explanation , none of these factoids is particularly meaningful . 
  were these people unqualified and promoted through cronysm ? 
  was the head of parliament acting illegally or exploiting some benefit unavailable to the greek population at large ? 
   the problem is the history of greece . 
  they have a record of being corrupt , cooking books and wasting government money . 
  the experiences of the last years with the greek governments have destroyed any basis for trust that the greeks will actually implement reforms on their own . 
  greece very nearly wiped its old political class and elected an entire new party to government . 
  it did n't win them any trust or respite , in fact it made the troika that much more intransigent . 
  please review rule [ 1.1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) and consider this a final warning . 
   you can either have fiscal transfers and austerity or no fiscal transfers and bankruptcy . 
  in the current european political climate , i agree ; it 's why i 'm talking about the future , and a distant and doubtful one at that . 
  [ i would n't want to extrapolate a trend hapzardly , but on ther other hand ... ] ( http://imgur.com/uvma45f ) the economic plans imposed on greece have failed spectacularly , not only compared to any decent standard of economic recovery but even compared to their own forecasts . 
  the only substantial recovery took place when the tsipras government withheld some of the planned austerity measures , giving some oxygen to greece 's asphyxiated economy . 
  now the chockehold is back , nice and tight . 
  two more years of heavy recession , followed by some distant hope for recovery that might well not materialize , given the previous spectacular failures of expansionary austerity . 
  are we ever going to reach a point when it becomes politically possible for european politicians to admit to the mistake of believing in austerity as a sound strategy during a recession ?

  this thread is about a different topic . 
   i never said anything about how often it happens , just that it has , and still does . 
  could you cite a case in the last 5 years of an archaeologist ( student , researcher , professor , museum employee ) stealing from a site to smuggle abroad ? 
   it 's a legitimate concern , and it makes sense to carefully vet who gets access to sites and artefacts . 
  what kind of background checks do you think go on for these things ? 
  aside from a few very precious or famous artifacts ( nearly all of which are very well protected in museums ) , access to sites is merely restricted due the risk of people damaging things , not theft . 
  archaeology students actually make up the majority of archaeologists working on most sites ( and certainly on the largest ones ) , and beside them the second most numerous demographic would be construction workers . 
  please review rule [ 1.1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) and consider this a warning . 
  please review rule [ 1.2 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ), 
  like i said , this is n't the 19th century . 
  speaking of `` polite archaeology '' and people taking a little money for a small risk makes as much sense as insinuating that doctors take money to alter clinical trials on the regular , and get banned from `` polite medicine '' if they get caught . 
  archaeology is an academic field like any other , not some sort of shady combination between adventuring , grave robbing and smuggling .

   `` spurious evidence '' had given the casts names that stuck , like `` the beggar '' or `` the slave , '' diminishing the victims into mere `` props to tell a story , '' ms. lazer said . 
  what ?
