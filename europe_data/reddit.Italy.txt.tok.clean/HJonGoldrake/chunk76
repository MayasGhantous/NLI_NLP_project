  the field is n't stuck in the 19th century , pompeian studies have long since progressed past this sort of thing . 
  claiming to be breaking ground here is a disingenous attempt at building credibility with the public , whereas archaeology has ` scientified ' a long while ago . 
   there was the supposition , for example , that the victims were mostly the very old , the very young , the infirm and women , `` on the assumption that they were not fast runners , '' ms. lazer said . 
  `` there was '' where ? 
  not in the academic literature of the last century . 
  i mean many of the casts are immediately evident as being of healthy males . 
  ms. lazer ( cool name btw ) is talking out of her ass here . 
   one consistency among the victims so far is that most `` had all their teeth , '' said roberto canigliula of philips spa healthcare , which designed and lent the scanner . 
  not to rain on the parade but this has been known so long the actual illustration signs in pompeii say this . 
   for example , one cast , found in the forum in 1963 , has been known as the `` pregnant woman '' because of the protuberance of the belly . 
  the ct scan revealed the person was probably not pregnant , and may not have been a woman . 
  the names were used merely as a convention , but it 's been decades since archaeologists stopped actually believing they were fair descriptions of what was inside . 
  this is a valid and interesting project , but the article has sensationalized it considerably . 
  archaeology was n't an unscientific field in need of rescue by advanced technology ; ct scans on pompeian casts have been done before and scientific methods for their study have been the norm for the past few generations .

   european museums are full of looted artifacts . 
  i 'm well aware . 
   this started in the late 19th century . 
  it started way earlier , unfortunately . 
   the still ongoing looting from origin countries . 
  this is absolutely doubtless , but it 's not academic archaeologists doing this ( today ) . 
  i repeat , this can literally ruin your career , and besides there would be no point since you could n't publish on the looted artifact nor could you put it on display . 
  contemporary archaeology places a huge emphasis on context and preservation even more than on finding . 
  there would be no point in smuggling something out of turkey ; no museum in europe would take it and , if discovered , your career would be ruined and you would face prison .

  if it consoles you , the visa application process to go do archaeological work in turkey is fairly nightmarish as well .

   i still do n't get why we did n't all just go and help the border countries when it was getting clear that things were getting too much . 
  that point was two years ago . 
  the reason why it did n't happen was that it was much easier to just push the problem away and not deal with it , since the trickle of people arriving in central and northern europe was small enough . 
  it was very easy and politically expedient to play tough with italy and greece and tell them that they were obligated to protect the border and handle everyone themselves , since those were the rules . 
  now that the numbers are so large they are being seriously felt in northern europe , it has suddenly become a european problem and we have meeting after meeting and a succession of european plans to handle it . 
  it 's been frankly saddening to see this process of small-minded selfishness unfold .

   the problem is that we do not even have a draft yet . 
  so do you agree then that we should get to see the drafts when they are at a sufficient level of completion then ? 
   nobody but them knows how a trade deal will actually affect our jobs and industry i strongly disagree . 
  companies might have their own best guesses as to how a trade deal will affect their own business , they might perhpas have a best guess as to how it will affect their industry , but they do n't have an overarching point of view , and they are especially bad at considering and defending the public interest when it is n't their own . 
  their technical input is valuable , but it would be equally as valuable if it came from industry experts that do not represent any given company for example . 
   and my argument is that we do not have the required knowledge to make any meaningful discourse on the issue ... 
  which applies to practically everything a government does . 
  tax laws are complex , most people do n't understand them . 
  science projects are so complex only specialists understand them . 
  healthcare organization ? 
  you need a degree for that . 
  would you rather we had a technocracy ? 
  i 'd rather have a democracy in which the public tries to make informed decisions based on a free discourse founded also upon technical knowledge provided by experts . 
   this is just not applicable when it requires more than one party there are multiple parties in parliament as well ( quite literally ) , so it is really very applicable . 
   do you know about burden of proof ? 
  it lies with the person making the absurd claim , not the person that accuses them of lying ... 
  the idea that the drafts are in a substantial relation to the final text of a law is n't absurd at all , it 's in fact widely corroborated by political practice visibile every day . 
   but they ( unless in a coalition government ) do not require the agrement of the other parties . 
  there are many instances in which they really do : beside coalition governments ( which are a regular occurrence in many parliamentary systems ) , there are things like constitutional laws that often require larger majorities than the government has . 
   you have grown childish . 
  you are the only one here that has to resort to name calling over and over and over again , and ca n't handle the fact that strong disagreement is n't a `` red mist '' . 
  but yes , let 's end it , this discussion has become seriously unpleasant . 
   that 's just not true ... learning about international regulations takes literally years and tens of thousands of dollars/euro 's / pounds . 
  learning about everything takes the same . 
  the public must make up its mind on environmental issues , which are equally as complex ; on science projects , which are even more obscure ; on complex foreign policy decisions like military intervention , which as so unforeseeable in consequence as to essentially lack meaningful reference expertise . 
   that 's just completely asinine .
