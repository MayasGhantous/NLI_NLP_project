  the only asinine thing is your attempt at rephrasing my comment to make it look stupid . 
  try to reply to what i 've actually said , it makes for better discussion . 
   i 'm sorry but you are living in a utopia that just does n't exist . 
  no , i 'm living in a complex world in which systems are imperfect and we must deal with that fact . 
  democracy requires that people vote in other people ; neither side of this process is endowed with knowledge of everything , including politicians . 
  but that does n't mean that democracy should be suspended and technocracy should be implemented . 
   however , negotiations for national legislation are also held in secret . 
  in part , sure , because of practicality : protocolling and releasing every phone call and party meeting would be impossible and the public could never scrutinize it . 
  but there is a good balance between practicality and openness : drafts are public , at least in the parliamentary systems i know of , as are parliamentary sessions ( with few exceptions ) . 
   it would quickly turn into the mother of all lobbying wars then handle the lobbying . 
  preventing citizens from reading a document because lobbyists will try to play games is unfair in the extreme . 
   that would actually be equally bad . 
  the companies have a right to lobby against disadvantageous laws/deals in public . 
  i strongly disagree . 
  companies are not democratic agents , people are democratic agents . 
  companies should n't vote and should n't be able to use money to influence the political process . 
  i want a democracy , not a plutocracy . 
   your comments have resorted to whining at me for the littlest comment this entire comment of yours is literally only whining that i 'm being pedantic , as was your previous one . 
  let 's just stop this pointless diatribe here and continue in the comment threads where we are still talking about the actual issues . 
   i did n't say that ... 
  but you implied it . 
   and how do you know those leaks are still applicable my argument is precisely that i should n't have to rely on leaks to know about the ttip , i should be able to be informed about the negotiation . 
   imo there is no point , especially from those that have 0 applicable qualifications ( e.g. 
  the general public ) ; judging an unfinished product . 
  this argument applies 1:1 to every single law and bill . 
  i doubt you 'd argue that the public should n't get to see laws before parliament is ready to put them to vote though . 
   no you are just plucking things out of your arse . 
  i 'm not going to respond if you are just going to lie . 
  you keep coming up with accusations of lying . 
  so far , you 've never substantiated a single one . 
  do you have any actual counter-argument beside obsessively repeating `` porkies porkies porkies '' ? 
   you 're right , it 's just a fact . 
  so you are literally admitting i 'm right and the ttip should n't be negotiated in secret ? 
  glad we could agree on that . 
   but we will . 
  your argument is crumbling bit by bit : you are now reduced to saying `` well you are right but you still lose , so ah ! '', 
   its completely different ball game when you have to involve other parties different parties are involved in parliament as well , in a literal sense . 
   yet everything within those leaks is subject to change already replied to this , and you even replied to that reply . 
   the public can not have discourse on things it does n't understand . 
  yes , it can . 
  through the big , slow , messy process of democracy , which involves public education , responsible journalism , appropriate divulgative documents and other such things . 
  it 's one of the difficulties of democracy that the public must decide on things it does n't automatically understand , but that does n't mean we need to suspend democracy . 
   i was not calling your comment populist hysteria you wrote a one-line reply to my comment decrying ` populist hysteria ' , it 's not at all unreasonable on my part to assume my comment was included in that description . 
   you are becoming very pedantic hjongoldrake . 
  take a sip of cold water and try to realize that not everyone critical of the ttip is wicked or stupid . 
  there are legitimate positions which are not yours . 
  you suffer from savannajeff 's disease : you got so deep into defending the ttip you automatically assume that everyone critical is ignorant and malicious . 
  if you can calm down and re-read my post with an open mind , you 'll realize the actual meaning of it . 
  that is absolutely terrible . 
  it 's very eloquently explained and it 's a great post , but the position it defends is abhorrent to any sense of democracy . 
   now , the reason the negotiations are conducted in secret is to keep each of these venn diagram bubble countries as large as possible . 
  this means exactly that the reason why negotiations are held in secret is to hide undesirable aspects of them from the population until the last minute , when they 'll have little chance of rejecting them since they will be bundled with everything else . 
  this is precisely my argument as for why the ttip should not be negotiated in secret . 
  i understand that negotiating it in secret is the best way to make it happen , but i do n't want it to happen if the only way is to force it past normal democratic discourse . 
   so the dairy union lobby launches a massive advertising campaign trying to scare the shit out of joe public about the new treaty this can happen with any law , any bill , at the international , national , regional , city level . 
  if the problem is too much political influence from moneyed interests , the solution is to regulate that ( by , for example , regulating or disallowing political ads by corporations ) , not to restrict democracy by not letting people see the text of treaties and laws . 
  jeff 's entire comment suffers , i think , from academic bias : he 's essentially arguing that since this process follows the best practices as they are understood by his field , then it 's fine . 
  but it is n't . 
  his analysis is completely devoid of any concern for democracy ; it is , in fact , perfectly orthogonal to my argument . 
   ratification is what we are actually looking for here . 
  ratification does n't happen in a vacuum . 
  one the treaty is signed internationally , it will make it that much more difficult for any given parliament to reject it because that would have obvious negative consequences on the international stage . 
  it 's especially problematic for the defense of the interests of the smallest nations . 
  calling my comment ` populist hysteria ' is no argument and actually betrays the weakness of grasping the `` it 's always been this way '' very , very thin straw . 
   how do you know this ? 
  because we have had leaks , from both sides . 
   otherwise stop telling porkies or you could stop claiming that people are lying as a first response , especially since you yourself do n't hold the truth in your hand . 
   we are n't the ones negotiating yes , we are , through our representatives . 
  democracy is a system of govern in the name of the people , not in the name of representatives , and public discourse is a fundamental aspect of that . 
  i already replied to your other points in a different response . 
  you are actually not explaining anything : saying that something has always been done one way is absolutely no justification for it . 
  plenty of things , especially in political processes , were done in one way for a long time and we 've rightfully changed that way because it was n't good enough . 
  an explanation would be illustrating the `` good reason `` s for this secrecy , and why the outweight the cons . 
   they will see it so why not let them see it now ? 
  why not let all of us see it now ? 
  parliamentarians and the public get to see drafts of laws and bills as they are going through the process and before they are final , there 's no reason we should n't get to see this massive trade deal through the same stages . 
   parliament does n't write laws in any country , government does . 
  i think you meant to say treaties rather than laws , because parliaments do definitely write laws in most countries ( i 'd even say in every democracy ) . 
   they get to see and vote on the end results , when its actually finished . 
  which is not good enough . 
  when it 's a finished product , it will be a giant trade deal , containing many things we like and many we do n't like . 
  removing provisions we do n't like is possible during the negotiation stage ** if we know about them ** , but they might end up passing if they are unavoidably packaged with others . 
   judging an unfinished product now when its unfinished is not a good idea of course it 's a good idea , that 's the only time you can give meaningful input . 
  once it 's finished it 's finished , you can only approve it in block or reject it in block . 
   ( from when the text is released ) 60 +60 +105 +30 +90 = 345 days = 12.3 months that picture shows that ** only 60 days ** pass between the text being released and the international agreement being signed . 
  the length of time you quote here is the time between text release and signing of the deal into law i.e. 
  ratification . 
  essentially , the timeline is this : you get 60 days to read , understand and analyze a giant trade deal and organize , if you want to , some sort of opposition before it is signed . 
  then , you have 10 months to try and get congress to not ratify it , which is going to be that much harder after it has been internationally signed . 
  i would say that quoting 60 days was perfectly fair on / u/searth 's part , especially since it 's indicative of how much time we ourselves will get ( which is at maximum 60 days if that is the american timeline ) . 
   just like every trade deal then . 
  this is systematically brought up to counter a lot of criticism to ttip and it makes no sense . 
  the fact that other trade deals have the same problems does n't justify their repetition in this one . 
  it 's not good enough to say `` it 's always been this way '' . 
   how do you know ? 
  it 's not been released yet ... we know it has a lot of fine print because we 've had leaks , pretty extensive ones . 
   that is 30 different independent democratic checks on ttip , do you think this is enough or ... ? 
  no , i do n't think it 's enough . 
  democracy is n't solely made up of the work of parliaments , it 's made up also of the free and open knowledge and discussion of political issues by the public . 
  a trade deal that is negotiated in a secretive manner and then put before the public for block approval or rejection curtails the public 's ability to absorb it and effectively voice its opinions about it .
