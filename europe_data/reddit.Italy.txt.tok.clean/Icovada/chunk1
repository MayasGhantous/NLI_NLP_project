yeah , i remember they have agreements on currency , post offices and much more with italy directly . 
  i did n't know they did things with the eu directly for the euro, 
  notice that the vatican does not have monetary agreements with the eu itself . 
  nor does san marino i suppose . 
  both have agreements with italy and accepted to use whatever currency italy uses, 
  i think bari-tirana is far more fun . 
  you know ... there 's a. . . sea ... in the middle, 
  what angers me the most is how they call this `` a triple recession '' . 
  look at the map . 
  it wend down ... then up ... then doooooown ... and it 's still going down . 
  it just went ^ ^ ^ up a tiny little bit last trimester . 
  that 's not `` growth '' and this is not `` a third recession '' . 
  that 's called `` mercy '', 
  i do n't know where he got that picture from , but the milan metro looks like [ this ] ( / meneghino _ \\ ( treno \\ ) #mediaviewer / file : metro_milano_meneghino_linea2 . jpg ), 
  italy , same . 
  i get 14/1 and i 'm super happy . 
  everything runs on shitty copper wires . 
  but the biggest isp is running fibre in all the big cities , except there are some places that do n't even have adsl yet . . 
  ehh no ... if there is one place where it could happen it would be a4 milan-bergamo and a1 milan-bologna . 
  but i go through both regularly and always 130 max . 
  where ? 
  i heard they were proposing it but nothing more, 
  anyone walking in the street must make himself identifiable . 
  which means , showing your face . 
  would you feel safe if you saw someone go around your street [ like this ? 
  ] ( http://www.dressspace.com/data/upload/passamontagna.jpg ) the police would very likely stop him and ask him who the hell is he and what is he doing going around like that . 
  then why should [ this ] ( http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2011/4/1/1301673637817/a-woman-in-a-burqa-008.jpg ) be any different ? 
  there could be anyone under that . 
  even a man with an uzi ready to go rob a bank . 
  no hidden faces , no exceptions, 
  no , elections have always been sunday and monday morning, 
  . . while telecom can do whatever it pleases to it , reconfigure ports , dhcp ranges , wifi password and check what other wifi you have around . 
  oh and also see exactly how many devices you have connected to your modem at any moment . 
  you 're being scammed . 
  i pay around 40 $ for 14 mbit ( should be 20 , but that 's what adsl on my line can do ) . 
  and i 'm not using some obscure provider . 
  good old telecom italia . 
  alice adsl, 
  we do http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/supercortemaggiore, 
  internet as fast as the extremely oversold connection to the isp 's local building is coming, 
  he has n't been elected to parliament but he has been elected as the leader of his party , so he is taking over his predecessor , who was elected to parliament, 
  i suppose that only the southern half of italy would laugh at this stupid video because over there fish means dick, 
  the white mountain in italy is a little superfluous . 
  it is still to this day called `` monte bianco '' which is modern italian for white mountain . 
  as is `` monte rosa '' which is `` pink mountain '', 
  italy not trusting italy is not that much of a surprise to me, 
  homeless is someone down with luck and needs help getting back up on his feet . 
  gypsy is someone who found a way to cash welfare checks and relish in his apparent poverty while raking up thousands through begging and stealing . 
  and then still give you that look . 
  that look of `` i 'm better than you '' they all give you, 
  when spoken decently ? 
  it can be . 
  but ~ ~ most ~ ~ all of those i have heard speaking it do it as fucking loud as they fucking can which just shows lack of good manners , which just irks me, 
  it 's a good thing you 're on the other side of the planet and you do n't know what i 'm talking about, 
   why do n't the turks , and arab muslims apologize to us when they did the conquering and subjugation ? 
  because they are way too busy making us apologise more and bend over to * their * current , ongoing invasion . 
  and we 're letting them, 
  out of focus , too much hdr , all i can see is ugly 70s concrete . 
  those ( in order ) snob mint lovers , communists and greasy-handed focaccia-eaters ? 
  yeah sorry forgot about them . 
  i guess they can join the club , after all, 
  if ticino , lombardia , friuli and veneto managed to get together and cut themselves a nice spot in the map by their own ... yes . 
  * the rest of * italy would lose more than everyone else in this map, 
  i am posting this from my work pc . 
  ( gim me a break . 
  i 'm on break ) i am also posting this from firefox . 
  all i know is that some times i get [ h + ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evolved_hspa ) signal but it barely moves . 
  but yeah . 
  i 'm near milan but kind of in the middle of nowhere.and i get h + . 
  they 're abolishing them next year , or way close to that, 
  then why is there data to graph ? 
  we have never had a government of `` our '' own . 
  it was always somebody else 's . 
  italy is a thing , true . 
  italians ... not . 
  there is no such thing as an italian . 
  that adjective only describes people living within the borders of the italian republic . 
  let 's go back in time . 
  rome . 
  rome got bigger and conquered the other populations . 
  so it was n't an italian government . 
  it was a government of rome on the populations living in italy . 
  then , barbars . 
  then ... whomever went by . 
  french , spanish , austrian , over and over and over . 
  any government was just an obstacle . 
  an annoyance to obey but , if possible , to bypass . 
  it 's not `` our '' , so who cares ? 
  and even the savoia , the royal family of italy , come from ... savoy , the french region . 
  they just happened to be ruling on it and piedmont and decided that it was best to look at this side of the alps . 
  and then they conquered all of italy . 
  go to florence , they 're proud of * their * past and * their * government . 
  go to siena ( they are really close ... ) and * they * are proud of * their * past and of * their * government and are still angry with florence for what happened a long time ago between their governments . 
  heck , siena is divided in neighbourhoods [ and they all proudly fight each other to this day . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palio_di_siena ) go to genoa and you 'll see a [ plate ] ( https://www.google.com/maps?q=piazza+corvetto,+genova,+ge,+italia&amp;hl=it&amp;ll=44.409876,8.938226&amp;spn=0.002407,0.004163&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=83.578352,136.40625&amp;oq=piazza+corvetto&amp;hq=piazza+corvetto,&amp;hnear=genova,+liguria,+italia&amp;t=m&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=44.40965,8.938195&amp;panoid=6iuuxabnd7m3wuhkd2kw9q&amp;cbp=12,65.26,,3,-2.7 ) put up in 2011 ( the year italy turned 150 ) commemorating `` the bloody massacre of genoans by the army of savoia '' , one of the first conquers of the soon to be nation of italy . 
  fact is , we do n't get along . 
  and we are so used not to get along ( and not care ... ) francia o spagna france or spain ( ruling upon us ) purch\u00e8 se magna as long as we eat that we see our current government as an annoyance , just like we saw the previous ones from the dawn of time . 
  tell that to my ex neighbours, 
  tough law , but law . 
  really ?
