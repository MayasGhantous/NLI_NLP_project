  we 're still having summerlike temperatures here , in the day . 
  but god help you if you have to get out of your home at 6:30 am . 
  you 're going to have to carry with you all day a shapeless mass of no longer necessary sweaters an jackets, 
  yup . 
  the main reason is that she wants to let everybody in . 
  the other reason is that she is black . 
  but mainly because she wants to let everybody in . 
  oh , everyone spewing this shit all the time . 
  i watch his channels , and i must say i see many more subtle attacks on him than obvious support . 
  also the obvious support is so exaggerated it becomes a joke . 
  oh i know it 's basically just a ping from the tower to the phone that also happens to contain text . 
  and i am in no way condoning the practice of spying . 
  i was just pointing out that an sms is n't ( and should n't be considered as ) metadata, 
  the content of an sms is n't metadata . 
  it 's data . 
  sender/receiver number and date are * meta * data , that is , data about data . 
   the final sentence it 's expected by september weird . 
  usually it takes more than three years to get to that point . 
  and for him , it just takes 3 months ? 
  looks like the whole justice system sped up , just for him . 
  maybe , just maybe , if they really all were on his side , they 'd drag it as long as possible so he 'd never be actually judged ? 
  just saying . 
  svezia e norvegia amando il progredir questa nazione progredisce nell ` arte del poltrone sweden and norway this nation loves progress so much it only progresses in the art of laziness, 
  no , but it makes no sense to hate on them so specifically when surely your country does the same, 
  like they 're the only eu country doing that .

  easy . 
   say someone visits italy and i will say ... where ? 
  which part ? 
  because there are extreme differences between north and south  say someone visits northern italy and i will say ... where ? 
  which part ? 
  north east and north west are different places and different traditions . 
  you can never be specific enough . 
  heck if you told me you went to masone ( 2000 inhabitants ) , my friend from there would ask you `` you did n't go to cu ( 20 houses about 400m from the town ) did n't you ? 
  those are inbred backward idiots . 
  still better than campo though ( other town of 1500 inhabitants , 2km away ) '', 
  `` we just upgraded our roaming pack from 2 $ per day for 20 mb to 3 $ per day for 25 mb ! '', 
  word for word message i received a while ago . 
  that 's not an improvement . 
  that 's 25 % more data for 50 % more money, 
  i have a friend who goes to check out his local lidl three times per week . 
  he never buys anything edible , just stuff from those bins . 
  and because those offers are so short , he is always full of awesome stuff that now one ca n't find anywhere . 
  bike lights , drill bits , solar panels , bugscreens ... 
  anything . 
  remember a few years ago ? 
  berlusconi went up to gaddafi and said `` yo stop sending us niggers 'n shit '' immigration to lampedusa decreased from a few thousand to like 2 people per year . 
  then they killed gaddafi . 
   voting is limited to single ip * three people , all redditors , living in the same flat * an university dorm these are just two examples of why you ca n't do that edit : redditors , not redactors . 
  took me over 24 hours to see it . 
   i have no problem with immigration but if you come to france ( or any european country ) , you must be grateful and integrate  if an immigrant commits a crime then kick him out fascist !, 
  in all seriousness , it seems that anyone who says that is labelled as far-right fascist racist negro-hating scum oppressor shitlord . 
  it 's nothing more than asking to behave . 
  sigh . 
  used to be so . 
  butchers ca n't sell bread , but apparently , if you brought it to them , they 'd happily cut it for you and put whatever you asked for , in it . 
  well , apparently up to 25-30 years ago you could bring bread to a butcher shop and have them make you a sandwich . 
  we just went the other way around . 
  possible . 
  though supermarkets do n't sell cups of coffee , here . 
  just fyi, 
  i realise there are people in very bad economical conditions , but do you realise we are talking about 4 cents per sale at most ? 
  to make it one euro you would need to go to the store 25 times . 
  that 's probably three months . 
  one euro every three months makes all this difference ? 
  i am sure beggars can get one whole euro in less than 20 minutes, 
  i am not talking about 100 euro products . 
  i am talking about a cart of stuff adding up to 100 euro . 
  you do not get the rounding for every single product . 
  \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / milk 1,30 ham 5,61 spaghetti 0,73 cheese 3,20 rebate -10 % -0,32 partial 10,52 rounding -0,02 total 10,50 thank you have a good day / \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ edit : now that i think about it , i do n't think they round * up * . 
  they only round * down *, 
  a whole one percent !, 
  aside from the fact that the x , x9 market strategy is n't really used here , you do realise that on a total of 100 , 130 euro ( which is n't uncommon to see ) it 's a whopping 0,00045 % and 0,00038 % difference ? 
  think of the savings , if you manage to end up with an exact total of 130,02 $ !, 
  whoa . 
  you had a 200 $ note in the last 3/4 years ? 
  last i 've seen them was 2004 . 
  at most . 
  they have disappeared completely . 
  not even banks have them . 
  my supermarket already does it . 
  not to single products , but on the final total . 
  if it 's 0,52 euro , it becomes 0,50 . 
  0,53 becomes 0,55 . 
  on the receipt . 
  edit : now that i think about it , they only round * down * . 
  so both 0,51 and 0,54 become 0,50, 
  1/bis for a long time it was weird * to not live with parents *, 
  i 'd much prefer the cold rainy weather over fucking hot one, 
  i have just completed two cisco certification courses . 
  everything is in english . 
  textbooks , class slides , end of chapter exams , everything . 
  that did not stop us from doing all the lessons in italian , our language . 
  want me to write in english ? 
  fine . 
  want me to study on english books ? 
  fine . 
  but if neither the teacher nor the students are english and/or of another language , there is no point in speaking in english . 
  makes everything more complex . 
  same for sicily,
