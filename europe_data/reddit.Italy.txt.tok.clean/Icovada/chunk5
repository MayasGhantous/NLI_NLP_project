  while i am not a smoker , whenever i go to the uk i feel bad for my smoker friends , who are n't even allowed to smoke in courtyards or under shelters , and have to go out in the rain . 
  i am glad i do n't have to deal with smoke anywhere , but come on , smokers are people too, 
  one year 1000 ? 
  i 'm paying about 300 $ / year . 
  it all depends on your records and the size of the engine though . 
  i wil just tell you one thing . 
  i * just * came back from the fuel pump . 
  i paid 75 $ for 40 litres of petrol , which ( assuming you 're americans ) is 9.60 dollars per gallon . 
  are you still sure you want to go around europe by car ? 
  would n't trains be cheaper ? 
  italy : * pizza and soda for two * 22 espressi * 15 cappuccini * 10 hours of parking in the street * groceries for 3-4 days * one month of 7/0 ,38 mbit internet at home * 7 kg of bread * about 10 kg of top quality spaghetti * from 0,5 to 1,4 kg of prosciutto , depending on quality * two 3d cinema tickets , or 3 simple ones * aperitivo for 3, 
  and me !, 
  just got my first payment notice . 
  me too . 
  even better , a month ago i went for a tour around europe with friends . 
  nobody told me but everyone freaked out and applied for a passport , and only brought that around , leaving the normal id home . 
  i only had that , and i got discounts on stuff because id cards say your profession ( student ) , passports do not, 
  but that 's because salsa * meant * tomato paste before it meant something else 6000 km away, 
  [ eh , thought of adding this to my first comment myself already ] ( http://www.myconfinedspace.com/wp-content/uploads/tdomf/431706/gslxk.png ), 
  ... eh , so i 'm a bit of orange , a bit of green and a dash of violet ? 
  more likely it 's the white line depicting borders, 
  who 's `` we '' ? 
   god commanded it to them where does it say so ? 
  i 'm wondering if those like you realise it was compulsory back in the time , just as all of my italian grandparents were balilla , because that was just what happened when you turned 6, 
   i 'd not go to bullfighting anywhere , not even to have a first hand view of how cruel it is . 
  you 'd be supporting it . 
  yeah , that 's the biggest problem with anything i guess . 
  i wish when entering you could be asked `` are you going to enjoy it , or are you just watching this for a pure , cold anthropological study ? '', 
  if it were an exhibition about the myth of the causeway it would be perfectly fine by my book . 
  we still read of zeus and athena afterall . 
  but that ... oh god, 
  my university 's newest building is called `` new building '' but we fixed it calling it '' [ the eggplant ] ( http://www.panoramio.com/photo/55052112 ) '' because except for the glass tower [ it 's all eggplant-coloured ] ( https://maps.google.it/?ll=45.201412,9.134361&amp;spn=0.004407,0.00795&amp;hnear=pavia+provincia+di+pavia,+lombardia&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=45.201412,9.134361&amp;panoid=hx_n8ttvbz_dcvollnzvjg&amp;cbp=12,56.01,,1,0.36 ), 
  maybe also because in italy vat is 21 % for food too , while in germany i think it 's 10 %, 
  luckily we have downvotes here, 
  i 'm really sorry . 
  i am in pavia , but i do n't have a couch here either . 
  well i do , but it 's already my bed . 
  well then do go there !, 
  i ca n't help you with a couch because i have never even been there , sorry, 
  [ the southernmost point of italy , and second only to the canary island for southernmost point of europe ] ( https://maps.google.it/maps?q=lampedusa&amp;hl=it&amp;ll=35.532226,12.65625&amp;spn=45.008763,55.722656&amp;sll=45.185888,9.156563&amp;sspn=0.154381,0.217667&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=lampedusa,+lampedusa+e+linosa+agrigento,+sicilia&amp;z=4 ) obviously it was a joke ... 
  not even when it speaks of austrian eagles having their heart burnt by polish blood ? 
  how about the ones saying that we 're ready to die for our country ? 
  not even when you park in front of your own home, 
  their shit attitude, 
  letsgocrazy said that he thought it was weird for women to `` condemn the decision as it put male circumcision on a par with female circumcision '' i said out loud what most probably those women thought . 
  because to them , it 's a loss of their privilege , so they will fight it, 
  noe thing is porn history , another is private email exchanged through an encrypted connection . 
  both are bad , but the second is much worse, 
  you mean we will be equated to males ? 
  as in , they will rise to our level of privilege ? 
  fuck no . 
  sadly i now a lot of people who think `` ew no , i 've studied 5 years for a degree in uselessness , i 'm not going to collect rubbish well you know what ? 
  too bad . 
  problem is , europeans do n't want to do the hard , dirty works because they think they are too qualified , people from outside the eu are ver happy to do those jobs ... and gypsies are just fine stealing stuff and being annoying . 
  it 's not that they do n't have work , and homes . 
  they do n't * want * work and homes, 
  the colour choice makes it look like none in the uk gives a crap about the eu . 
  actually , the percentage is 48 % , as you can see in the side . 
  not * too * bad , and certainly way different than the colours would show, 
  no , we can build them a camp , where to concentrate them . 
  i think someone tried to do that before , but he went bankrupt or something, 
  yet many out of that 22.6 % probably do work , without paying taxes , so end up in that number . 
  i have a friend who is 24 now , he 's been working since he was 18 ... and only recently his work became official , when he was hired by a laundering plant . 
  he 's been working as a waiter for 5 years without a regular contract , not to mention all the work he did in farms and such, 
  for the downvoters : you do n't know how southern europe works, 
  [ 1/3rd up , just slightly to the left , exactly in the middle between most parties in italy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/86bri.jpg ) . 
  i guess the feeling that nobody is representing me is true , then, 
  / r/asmr, 
  it is much more likely for northern italy to secede than sardinia ... 
  we laugh , but in some other countries i 've seen some weird stuff , like `` who wants to be a 250 million $ localcurrency man '', 
  `` hello , i help you ? 
  you order ? '', 
  italy here , i embarazzed for read the graph , its terribil that little persons talk english , we too big turist place and that 's about as well as 90 % of that 30 % can speak english , i 'm afraid, 
  not in a two-three year span , though, 
  and being a billionaire was twice ad easy as being a millionaire now !, 
  before euro , in italy we had lire . 
  the fixed exchange rate to one euro was set to 1936,27 , which made it easy to convert everything to a roughly 1:2000 exchange rate in our minds . 
  it also meant that it in a few years everything doubled . 
  being used to pay 20.000 lire at a restaurant , it does n't strike us anymore that the now 20 $ bill is actually worth 40.000 lire . 
  so sad . 
  also , the fact that we were used to very small banknotes ( `` when you go abroad you always come back with so many coins ! ), 
  contributed to the devaluation , at least in our minds . 
  the biggest coin we had was 500 lire , worth 26 euro cents , and the smallest banknote was 1000 lire , 52 cents , almost one tenth of a 5 euro note . 
  `` it 's just a coin '' we kept thinking . 
  except it 's worth 8 times more than before . 
  [ 1.000 lire ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/lire_1000_%28maria_montessori%29.jpg ) [ 2.000 lire ( really rare , almost as rare as the 200 $ note is today ) ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/lire_2000_%28guglielmo_marconi%29.jpg ) [ 5.000 lire ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/lire_5000_%28vincenzo_bellini%29.jpg ) [ 10.000 lire ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/lire_10000_%28alessandro_volta%29.jpg ) [ 50.000 lire ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/lire_50000_%28bernini%29.jpg ) [ 100.000 lire ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/lire_100000_%28caravaggio%29.jpg ) [ 500.000 lire ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/lire_500000_%28raffaello_sanzio%29.jpg ), 
  yes , of course , because it 's well known the peak of energy request is in the middle of the night , right ? 
  if we have to buy energy at night , we 'd need it at day too , and if we do n't need it during the day , why should we buy it overnight ? 
  electricity ca n't be stored in large quantities , at most we can use it to reverse our hydroelectric plants , pumping water back up in the lakes to then discharge it at night . 
  except , if a plant explodes in france , all of europe is fucked . 
  and you pay a lot more for that energy . 
  it 's just stupid . 
  italy does it too . 
  everyone is bashing their antinuclearism , shouting `` chernobyl !, 
  the instant you say something in favour of nuclear . 
  yet nobody realises we rely on more than half of our needs from france 's nuclear power . 
  and that their plants , that produce energy for us , are right there next to the border . 
  the alps did n't protect us from chernobyl , they wo n't do much either against france . 
  haha one week ? 
  try three fucking months , like here .
