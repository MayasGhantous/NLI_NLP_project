  with this i do n't mean he had it planned months ahead , just that he saw what he thought was the perfect opportunity for a funny remark and he took it . 
  his domestic support was largely built on his well-constructed image , and there 's really no reason to drop it even at its peak . 
  being consistent with your image is one of the key aspects of communication , be it for commercial brands or for leaders . 
  domestic support is also not all that matters . 
  countries that might choose to support , condemn , or oppose him would have a harder or easier time doing so depending on the public opinion behind them . 
  the impression you make on the public opinion is never something you can brush off as not important . 
  putin , in regards to his image , has been trying to counter the western press painting him as an inhumane dictator for a while . 
  making a point with a joke looks like a nice opportunity to pick up . 
  i do n't know . 
  it was humor , but i have to agree with yaix that it 's wrong to call it * just * a joke . 
  the message was there , it was not just meant to simply elicit laughter . 
  i would have been more inclined to call it just a joke if it were n't a common point in putin 's narrative , that what 's going on in russia is no different than what happens regularly in the west . 
  guess that 's why all their plumbers need to move abroad . 
  also `` in culo al mondo '' ( up the world 's ass ) and `` in culonia '' ( in assland ), 
  i think one of the rules of decency is not taking liberties that if everyone else took as well it would be bad for everyone . 
  that goes for things like littering , interrupting people as they 're talking , and so on and so forth ... and yes , bringing your kid to the ep as well . 
  not a fan of this kind of behavior and i find it to be pretty unprofessional and selfish . 
  much more so if the ep does have a daycare like / u/jebusgobson said ( i did n't know ) , but it would be regardless . 
  [ phew ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=a0yxfvfdd-0#t=4.65 ), 
   threw darts at youth team players . 
  i 'm not a huge football fan , but if i had to guess i 'd say : because reddit 's userbase vastly comes from the anglosphere and he 's recently played 3 years with manchester city ; because of his antics that make people talk a lot about him ; and also because he 's not half bad .

  actually i remember reading a study claiming that smokers are actually a net benefit for the economy . 
  according to it what is spent in health care is more than made up by the fact that on average they do n't live to be old enough to get pension money from the state for long . 
  i do n't remember in which country they took their data though , might be different around the world . 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27avsu/the_quality_of_comments_on_reurope/chzdesc?context=3  i even occasionally throw out down vote bait if i want to test out an opinion or start a discussion . 
  the argument here would be that threatening to leave whenever you do n't get what you want is an attempt to override democracy . 
  that 's why there 's some who 'd look forward to the uk taking the decision at once , whichever it is . 
  democracy is the thing you do with your and your allotted representatives ' votes , not with blackmail . 
  i 'm neither in favor nor against the uk leaving the eu , but i do n't see the contradiction you seem to be implying . 
  it would make sort of sense if the reason those people were calling for the uk to exit were that the uk is below the economic standards of the eu ( which would clash with the fact that people seeking to emigrate to the uk is one indicator of economic well-being ) , but since that 's clearly not the case ... 
  agreed , but if he replaced `` nowadays '' with `` in this context '' , he would n't be too far off the mark . 
  difference between cameron and renzi being that one 's party got over 40 % of the votes and the other 's 23 %, 
  i agree with pretty much everything you said . 
  however , i think the last elections made it clear that the british public wants someone who appears firm , who 'll hold their ground and speak up , to represent them in the eu . 
  might not be the smartest tactic on a european relations level , but not a bad move to win electorate approval on a national level . 
  however , in my experience , most students opt out . 
  both in high school and middle school only around 1/4 -1 / 3 of the class would take religion as a subject . 
  might be different in the south though , i have no idea . 
   ` man tax ' what * [ googles ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/05/26/uk-europe-election-sweden-idukkbn0e60yv20140526 ) *  [ feminist initiative co-founder and spokesperson gudrun schyman ] has also made headlines comparing women 's situation in sweden to life under afghanistan 's taliban . 
  she once called for a `` man tax '' to be levied to compensate for years violence against women . 
  what, 
  because the gini coefficient is a measure for inequality , but does n't give any information at all about the average . 
  a hypothetical country where everyone had an income of 1 cent would appear splendid on an income gini coefficient graph . 
  well to be fair you never know when those pesky carthaginians might show up again , for all we know a fourth punic war could be just around the corner . 
  median income would be a more interesting stat to look at than median wealth . 
  my first thoughts exactly . 
  admittedly , i just skimmed through the paper and read the suggested footnote ( really short on time right now ) , but from savannajeff 's summary of it i ca n't see how trade diversion could impact negatively the gdp of the countries inside the union . 
  it seems really counter-intuitive . 
  the only way that footnote makes sense to me is by interpreting gdp as * global * gdp ( which is also the usual effect of trade diversions ) , not ecu participants ' . 
  if you 're on a laptop , try reclining the screen back a bit , worked wonders here . 
  there 's a saying over here that goes `` the merciful doctor leads the patient to their death '' . 
  the populist doctor is the one that convinces his morbidly obese patient with a history of heart attacks that there 's nothing wrong with his size and proceeds to prescribe a diet of burgers ; in our case the doctor then gets paid based on how much said patient enjoyed the treatment . 
  i 'm not commenting on whether the far right 's modus operandi fits the term populist or not cause that 's a can of worms i 'd really rather keep sealed . 
  but this is basically the reason why populism is seen as carrying negative connotations .

  so long as none of the protesting section of the abstainers complain about the results in the end , i 'm cool with it . 
  otherwise , i believe there 's less masochistic ways to protest . 
  i 've always found it pretty idiotic to try and shame homophobes by calling them closeted gays , since in the end it 's always meant as a thinly veiled insult . 
  `` haha look at that homophobe , bet he 's a ~ ~ fag ~ ~ ^ ( wait , not pc ) closeted gay himself '' feels a bit like even these `` progressives '' are treating gays as if they were special ed kids that do deserve equal rights but are still in a way inferior since `` stupid '' and `` mentally challenged '' remain insults . 
  the ultra obvious factual inaccuracy of the claim that most homophobes are closeted gays also excludes any other intent from the phrase . 
  does anyone * really * believe that the culture of a homophobic country could shift 90 % of a given population 's sexual orientation to ( closeted ) gay ? 
  come the fuck on . 
  right , thank you :p, 
  i 'm just a bit annoyed that despite having been one of the largest net contributors ( in total value , per capita , and as percentage of gdp ) since the start and even throughout the crisis when we could definitely have done with a bit of help , there 's apparently this widespread notion that italy is taking money from germany and the eu . 
  you can read something to that effect on reddit every other day . 
  oltre al danno anche la beffa , we 'd say here ( mockery on top of the damage , roughly ) . 
  what ? 
  where do you live and what isp ? 
  say you were in charge of the decision , where else would you put the capital instead ? 
  for it to not give the idea that some regions are more important than others , i mean . 
  tu quoque only makes sense as a fallacy if used as a means to absolve oneself though . 
  it 's not to be used for that purpose , but it * can * be relevant if the other party is including in its argument , explicitly or implicitly , a claim of superiority . 
  if this is meant to be a common effort from which everyone benefits , the cost has to be shouldered by everyone , though . 
  has the eu , america , or any other stakeholding country offered to chip in or proposed a better solution to help shoulder the joint cost of the sustained production and negotiation costs , penalties , missing profits and loss of credibility that would follow from cancelling the deal ? 
  not that i know of . 
  then making france the scapegoat of the day and saying they should have done this and that for the greater good instead is just hypocritical . 
  the problem here is the lack of coordination , not france making the only obvious choice given a lack of it . 
  the first 2 clips are fake , by the way . 
  really ? 
  a couple of cheesy words put together ? 
  you get better statements at beauty pageants, 
  you literally do n't know anything about the girls singing or whether they support putin or the invasion of crimea . 
  as for what * i * would want people to do , that would be applaud , or boo , the performance . 
  either way booing because russia serves no purpose and is , if anything , counterproductive - if you actually give a shit about the russian issue and not just about mindlessly venting your anger , that is . 
  even leaving aside the question of whether they deserve it or not , booing in this context is received as an insult to the russian population , and all insults ever accomplish is causing divisions and people getting on the defensive , not to reconsider their position . 
  the one above the girl with the beer ?
