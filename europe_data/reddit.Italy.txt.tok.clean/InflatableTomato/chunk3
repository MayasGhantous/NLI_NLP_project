  i think that should be poland, 
  i do n't know , i 'm pretty sure they already know how europeans feel about the matter . 
  my understanding is that the aim of the russian propaganda machine is just to spread the idea that europeans ' opinions on the matter suck and that a sensible person would n't listen to them , not to hide them altogether . 
  edit : fell -  feel, 
  yea maybe . 
  on an unrelated note , just noticed there 's an l too many in their `` balklan '', 
  i think italy is violin and colours palette dude dressed in green , white and red ( far right , right under the first row ) . 
  red headband for stallone 's rambo maybe ? 
  the only thing this might have accomplished is to push the us-versus-them mentality a little farther in the russian people 's minds . 
  the message they receive is that europeans do n't only hate russian government and its actions , but even the russian people themselves . 
  if you want to have a peek even though it 's all in italian , we recently had [ a post in / r/italy where every top level comment is a sentence spoken in the writer 's dialect ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/235dio/cazzeggio_tu_che_parli_dialetto_dammi_una_frase_e/ ) , and the others would try and guess the meaning . 
  some of them i tried but i really could n't guess . 
  on what basis ? 
  they arrived in europe centuries ago , i do n't think you can hold india accountable for them . 
  and juventus is not even an italian word , it 's latin for youth . 
  on the other hand , he 's right about milan the football club which stays milan in italian as well , even if the city it derives its name from is milano . 
  nah not really . 
  it does n't really match questions like `` have you been at work today ? '', 
  `` how are you ? '', 
  `` did you bring x ? '', 
  good catch, 
  actually you can boil it down to just ` what/who/where / how the fuck ' . 
  [ what the fuck are you saying ?

  edit : and why/when/whose the fuck , of course . 
  that should have been enough to understand the pattern , though . 
  more of these please !, 
  yep , but it 's not just the mafia * in itself * , it 's also a vicious cycle with the population in general seeing dishonest people succeed and honest people getting nowhere , which in some places ends up affecting people 's expectations , ambitions , definition of successful person , and then adding to the mass of dishonest people . 
  if you click on the link posnania posted in comments you can see the methodology used . 
  it has nothing to do with math , it 's just general problem solving skills . 
  i quickly scrolled through a few pages , one example question was , while interacting on an mp3 player device simulator on pc , to find a way to have it maintain access to all its functionalities after removing one button , or another again was how to achieve a result by pressing the least number of buttons , etc. . . 
  `` has killed jews in the past '' vs `` jew killer '' , if my italian helped me guess correctly, 
  there 's iterative versions of all kind of games ( including the prisoner 's dilemma ) , but what makes it more convienient to cooperate is the fact that the games are repeated , it 's got little to do with the prisoner 's dilemma setup in particular . 
  and that 's why i said it 's not characteristic of the prisoner 's dilemma , but of repeated games . 
  that 's actually not characteristic of the prisoner dilemma in particular , but of [ repeated games ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/repeated_game ) . 
  in the prisoner 's dilemma 's basic form not cooperating is actually the only rational strategy . 
  complication does n't imply any particular level of complexity at all . 
  it implies an increase in complexity . 
  i do n't find it necessary because emails are not intrusive . 
  it 's the expectation of the task to be carried out outside work hours that might be . 
  i 'd even have a preference for being able to know beforehand if i wanted to . 
  it requires a few additional steps and solves a non-issue . 
  unnecessary , complication . 
  still an unnecessary complication , though . 
  since we 're nitpicking , you can actually also read it as : `` i 'm 100 % sure that the chances of a russian attack are above 0 % '' . 
  regardless , they still spend roughly 25 times finland 's budget for their military . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-comparison-detail.asp?form=form&amp;country1=finland&amp;country2=russia&amp;submit=compare+countries ) is a comparison between the resources available to the two armies , to better understand what that translates to in practice . 
  finland would barely be able to put up a fight in the hypothetical scenario if russia deployed even one fifth of its military resources available . 
  ( note that the site also purposefully does n't take into account nuclear capability , but doubt there 's even a single scenario where russia would be able to drop a nuke without serious consequences ), 
   the attacker needs usually 4:1 over power ( meaning if finns can defend with 6 brigades , russia would need 24 brigades to win ) depending on quality of the troops , tanks etc. 
  [ military budget ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_military_expenditures ) : 90.7 billion vs 3.7 billion [ manpower ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel ) : 3.25 million vs 0.388 million just saying, 
  going by this thread it seems you would n't have much trouble finding a few volounteers . 
  plus , for example i 'm pretty sure to this day and for many years ahead we still have take-or-pay long term contracts with russia in italy . 
  if we did n't buy their gas we 'd still be bound by contract to pay for it . 
  i do n't have a linkable source , that 's what i remember from last year 's industrial economics class i took ( held by an italian ex minister for industry and eni board member ) . 
  italy 's specific situation was for the most part not exam material and so i did n't memorize all of it , but it should all still be in my notes somewhere . 
  1 ) that 's a big * if * . 
  with sub par quality control , you end up hurting the original brand 's brand equity and reputation . 
  2 ) free riding . 
  you 're hijacking brand image and communication investments you never paid for , reaping the benefits while spoiling its value . 
  3 ) to some people it does matter if parma ham comes from parma or not , you have no right to decide for the consumer what it is that matters or not . 
  functional benefits are not all there is to a product . 
  4 ) if you 're so confident in the merit of your product ( and unregulated market ) , sell it by your own name and if it 's actually competitive i 'm sure it 'll grow a reputation on its own merit . 
  so let 's not downvote the guy even if he came off as hostile , because that does no good to discussion either and he raised a very valid point . 
  talk about dimples , his cheeks are a cluster of folds, 
  you mean deficit ? 
  it 's money collected by the government minus money spent by the government , for each year . 
  if the result is negative , it 's called a deficit , otherwise it 's a surplus . 
  as deficit accumulates every year , it goes to form public debt . 
  this article says that france is forecast to not meet the 3 % deficit target asked by the eu in order to keep public debt contained . 
  i just pulled the first results from google , that one in particular might have been a few years outdated , but the whole point is that pretty much any graph you could find pointed in the same direction , with very slight variations between one and the other . 
  [ check this one then ] ( http://steadfastfinances.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/national-obesity-rates-by-body-mass-index-by-economist.com_.gif ), 
  that 's pretty interesting when any graph you can google about obesity ( either adults or all ages ) puts italy consistently among the least obese countries in the world ( e.g. 
  [ 1 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/obesity_country_comparison_-_path.svg ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.lovelljohns.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/obesity_in_europe_cartogram_map.png ) [ 3 ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/50326000/gif/_50326564_obesity_rates_464.gif ) [ 4 ] ( http://www.dw.de/image/0,,16820851_4,00.jpg ) ) . 
  do italians shrink once adulthood is reached ? 
  is this a new trend starting with children ? 
  do we have an unusual weight distribution with very few obese and many overweight ? 
  quite curious also that the article lists all the major offenders without any mention of italy , which according to the graph should have had the worst result . 
  oh my god . 
  it 's looking at you with a grin while you eat him, 
  took me forever to find italy . 
  all the others are intelligible enough , but i have to say that now i 'm kind of curious about how the fuck you poles managed to turn `` italia '' into `` w\u0142ochy '', 
  the two things are not as disconnected as you 're making them out to be , especially for the long term the best interests of the eu can very well consist exactly in showing backbone . 
   i wonder how many europeans actually have undeclared swiss bank accounts and the like . 
  also , we did hurt ourselves with the actual move . 
  [ here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/swiss_cap_market.png ) 's an estimate i found on [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banking_in_switzerland#european_union ) . 
  the numbers are in billion chf , that is to say billion euros x 1.2 . 
  the [ study ] ( http://www.safehaven.at/wordpress_cms/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/helvea-studie.pdf ) was conducted by [ helvea ] ( http://www.helvea.com/helvea/pages/index/p/1 ) . 
  i know people from the east tend to emigrate , but i do n't understand why their * governments * would want them to . 
  i was n't trying to be sarcastic , i was just wondering why . 
   moreover , eastern european countries in the eu will never ever want to discuss limitations to the free movement of people . 
  i could be missing something , but it seems counter-intuitive to me . 
  what do they stand to gain compared to others ? 
  do their governments want all their workforce to move away from their home countries towards better wages ? 
  it 's not a country typing , it 's a dude . 
  i do n't think it was meant to be a dick measuring contest , or that being insulting like that was a proper reaction to his comment ...
