  if i had to guess i 'd say he 's probably just worried for us , but that aside , why should n't he ? 
  an economy as large as ours crumbling down would have very significant consequences for all of europe and not just the italians , especially now that it 's in such a delicate and fragile situation as it is . 
  i think what he was trying to say is that the crisis that happened in ireland is one answer to why one would n't want to give up their own currency . 
  convincing or bribing/threatening ? 
  were n't there public speeches or discussions about the merit or lack thereof of a given proposed law ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_speech#origins  freedom of speech and expression has a long history that predates modern international human rights instruments . 
  it is thought that ancient athens ' democratic ideology of free speech may have emerged in the late 6th or early 5th century bc . 
  two of the most cherished values of the roman republic were freedom of religion and freedom of speech . 
  people keep saying this , but i do n't understand how the fact that it was a democratic vote is of any relevance whatsoever . 
  why would it be any different if it were a decision taken via means of representative democracy versus direct ? 
   whites have a natural aversion to race mixing just as lower races have a natural attraction to it ( hence black on white rape ) did you find this on wikipedia ? 
  ( edit : to clarify , what i 'm quoting here comes from the deleted comment above , not something i mined from his history ), 
  so , the thread signaling stormfront doing a blitz on / r/europe is 16 days old , your account is 18 days old and filled to the brim with comments about genetic superiority of the white race and other racist stuff ... hmmm, 
  i do n't know . 
  i was curious and decided to google it , found the [ wikipedia article for banking in switzerland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banking_in_switzerland#european_union ) , the featured graph referencing a swiss news outlet citing a helvea study , and went to check the chf to euro exchange rate to get an idea of the value i was looking at . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.safehaven.at/wordpress_cms/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/helvea-studie.pdf ) should be the complete pdf of the study if you 're interested and [ this ] ( http://www.helvea.com/helvea/pages/index/p/1 ) is helvea 's website . 
  i agree they do n't , but they often make for a convincing argument . 
  on a different note , saying that desiring stricter immigration policies necessarily makes you racist is way too simplistic . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/swiss_cap_market.png ) ( in billion chf . 
  divide by 1.2 for billion $ ) . 
  if you consider that according to that graph ( which comes from a swiss study nonetheless ) 88 % of the money from eu is illegal , and apply that same percentage to that coming from other continents for what is probably a conservative estimate , you get to about 48 % of the swiss capital market rounded down . 
  it 's 7 in the morning and i 'm just about to go sleep * now * so to be honest i have no intention to go back and check , but i do n't see a reason not to take your word for it . 
  i must have misunderstood in that case , my apologies . 
  it 's not even that . 
  the anti-us circlejerk sure is rampant in / r/europe , but reading that thread he linked and the parts where he participated in particular , curtholiday is conflating being in favour of the protesters with being in favour of an eu military intervention in ukraine . 
  there 's a million reasons why one does n't necessarily imply the other . 
  aaah , good times ... 
   if nobody can have ivory then there 's no longer any demand for ivory . 
  you 're assuming france is the only ivory seller in the world . 
  you 're also assuming that simply stopping to buy it would n't have the same effect and better . 
   you 're suggesting that instead of trying to cut back on the demand for ivory i 'm not suggesting that * instead of * . 
  i 'm saying that cutting back on the demand is not even an option because it 's simply not something that happens when you destroy ivory . 
  or rather , it happens at first ( but not even that much , since luxury items demand is generally not very elastic to price ) because it makes the prices rise , which encourages more poachers to kill and then the price to find a lower balance point , with a net result of just more elephants killed - which as i understand should be the issue here . 
  you can simply stop buying it . 
  not selling the one you already have is what makes the supply decrease and the price * really * rise and then the amount of elephants killed increase until the price finds another balance point . 
  in a sense it 's like the supply artificially increases to replace the amount lost . 
  keeping already obtained ivory does n't kill any elephants , and certainly does n't bring back any to life , either . 
  at the same time it destroys riches , which could have gone in a number of economical pockets , including welfare considering that from what i gathered it was state-owned . 
  all it does is reduce the sense of guilt of people sensitive to the issue , and not much more . 
  on a completely unrelated note , reading ` somali chebabs ' in the article made me giggle , since we read ` ch ' as ` k ' in italy . 
  it does suck , but 1mbps is not representative and very far from being the average speed - less than one seventh of the average , in fact . 
  falling exactly into the average myself and having played online games before , i can say the bottleneck in overall gaming performance has always been latency for me . 
  but if you 're with telecom , [ for just an extra 3 $ a month ] ( http://www.telecomitalia.it//internet/superinternet-play/internet-play ) that can be drastically improved , as i found recently . 
  pinging 12-13 ms right now , and the difference is very noticeable . 
  i do n't get it . 
  care to explain ? 
  do n't take this the wrong way , but is there any reason why one should adopt specifically from bulgaria ? 
  you can find abandoned animals to rescue in animal shelters of whatever country you live in . 
  an animal life being an animal life , the only difference is they 're easier to just pick up from your domestic shelter . 
  naive ( or gullible for that matter ) is antithetical to malice though , so i think it was a really poor choice . 
  i think he 's right though , the american media * might * have decided to cover it so extensively because of the amplifying effect of the [ pretty white girl ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/missing_white_woman_syndrome ) factor and whatnot , but the american * people * are mostly mad because of the whole entire narrative/angle they were fed . 
  * naive * innocent people repeatedly lie to the authorities ? 
  i think the adjective here would be the one chosen by kasparus . 
  she 's dumb and she 's stupid if she 's innocent , not ` naive ' . 
  not to mention cunning , because if she even was innocent she tried to frame other people just to get the police off her own back , which is the most disgusting thing you can do as an innocent person . 
  not american so i ca n't say for sure , but what i know is they made a movie about it , and it took 1-2 hours for the article to reach the front page * and * sit there for a while , with a comment section oozing with hate for italy in most upvoted comments , showing a pretty strong emotional involvement by the general public ( in fact , i had n't seen so much vitriol on a reddit comment section since the times when the media covered indian rape cases and that other time with the knockout game played by certain black youth ) . 
  these are not generally things that happen to `` barely a story `` s. 
  oh , nevermind then - i figured that part , it 's just that it sounded a bit like standard procedure to not even bother checking at home until they randomly find you . 
  what do you mean by ` if the police finds you ' ? 
  to send you letters are n't they supposed to know exactly where you live already ? 
  do they have to encounter you in tall grass before they catch you ? 
  you probably would n't be too far off if you ask me , but just as coincidence . 
  on reddit 's defaults anyone from anywhere can write , but it 's americans who put the comments they like at the top , by having the largest share of upvotes by far . 
  could be confirmation bias on my part , but at least here on / r/europe it really seems to also reflect the general attitude . 
  everytime it 's brought up there 's an upvoted french-flagged comment pointing out exactly what you said . 
  tried some countries , my autocomplete gives at least a few different results , e.g. 
  what i get for spain is , in order : called spain , in debt , important , famous . 
  got ta love the `` why is italy shaped like a boot '' though . 
  first , that 's a very limited set of laws , in particular one that would n't help solve this specific dilemma . 
  second , law is convention , not scientific research . 
  we do n't `` know '' what rights everyone is entitled to . 
  if we did , it would n't change so much across borders . 
  you 're entitled to your own opinion on the matter , but do n't frame it as if there 's a clearly , objectively definable ` wrong ' and ` right ' side . 
  in this kind of argument i can personally see two ways to proceed : one is discussing the ethics of the alternatives , the other is discussing their effects in practice . 
  maybe there 's more . 
  but please do n't appeal to `` the ( western european ) law is correct because the ( western european ) law says so '' argument because that boils down to circular thinking . 
  sounds like the problem is defining what rights everyone is entitled to , then . 
  and there we are back to square one . 
  you 're not wrong . 
  on the other hand , there 's some fundamental level of bias which i believe is ineliminable in any human being , but i like to think that when someone 's saying `` without bias '' it could at least mean they 're making an active effort in their mind to work on the eliminable part , which is better than nothing . 
  downvote not mine btw . 
  eh , sorry mate , not much into roleplay myself ;(, 
  that sub is a massive circlejerk , and not in the good tongue-in-cheek way , either . 
  because crazies usually come with crazy determination and often move a lot of money . 
  identifying them as immigrants * first and foremost * is what has the potential to be harmful . 
  their immigrant status is relevant in many a discussion though , and you need a term to refer to that segment of the population . 
  yea , i was n't really trying to refute your argument with that , just nitpicking :p ( also : it 's awkward when someone receives a downvote within minutes of replying to my comment , but i swear it was n't me ), 
   take interest rates , for example . 
  in germany , the yields on 10-year government bonds are less than 2 % . 
  in spain they are close to 7 % , and in italy just under 6 % . 
  [ in italy it 's actually 3.8 % anyway ] ( http://www.borse.it/spread/quotazioni/btp_bund/1080 ), 
  sad but true . 
  on the other hand , gelato is not as popular in bologna as in coastal cities - rimini for example has its gelaterie always stacked with customers . 
  though there 's no shortage of mcd 's and mcflurry customers there either . 
  but it should also be said that they offer a different service . 
  mcdonalds have seats , sometimes drive-throughs , and it 's group-friendly in that you can go there with friends allowing everyone to leave not too dissatisfied and with the kind of food they 're looking for , whether it is a burger/ice cream/fries/dessert or whatever . 
   if the skin colour of a particular minister `` elicits '' such a response from the italian right , then the italian right has a problem , not the minister or her party . 
  it does n't have to be one or the other . 
  personally i despise both their behaviors equally . 
  the northern league for being the usual scumbag racists , and the democratic party for egoistically putting this sort of pr stunt before the country 's well being by intentionally filling a ministry seat with a potentially dangerous and inadequate candidate for that very specific position .
