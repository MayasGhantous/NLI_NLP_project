  i was just expanding on other contextual aspects of this issue that have been ignored by the article and are not much talked about . 
  also , i 'm really not sure what the courts or the law have to do with this since nowhere have they been brought up . 
  you sound just like the typical target for this maneuver . 
  it 's not the color of her skin i 'm concerned about , she could be white as far as i 'm concerned . 
  but her place of birth is very relevant given her specific task . 
  she 's spent half of her life in the one area that accounts for possibly the largest share of the illegal immigration . 
  she immigrated * illegally * herself by her own admission and later gained citizenship by marrying an italian . 
  in my national government i want people who are concerned with my own country 's well-being , not people who have a potential vested interest in the benefit of some other people or an ideological axe to grind . 
  if the conflict of interest was not enough , her education is * completely irrelevant * to the position she fills , and there were plenty of other better choices . 
  she 's an eye doctor for fuck 's sake , you 're telling me there were n't better solutions for that particular job , with all the risk she could carry ? 
  that 's all i care about , and i 'm disgusted both by the left for disregarding all these valid concerns and taking * unnecessary * risks for a whole country of 60 million people just to prop themselves up and collectively jerk off to how progressive they are , and by the right for attacking her on the basis of her race . 
  the only difference is at least the northern league is in your face about how much of an asshole they are , what you see is what you get . 
  and i 'm centre-left-leaning myself , mind you . 
  if anything , she 's been subject to positive discrimination . 
  it 's obvious to everyone that she 's been put in that position * due to * the color of her skin , not * despite * it . 
  i 'll repeat what i said in another thread last year on a similar episode . 
  while i do not condone the racial attacks , she was obviously put in her position as a left-wing pr stunt aimed at looking progressive and eliciting a negative response from the right . 
  this woman spent the first half of her life in africa , immigrated illegally , and of all positions she was assigned to the ministry of integration , and tasked with making italian citizenship easier to obtain for immigrants . 
  it 's like if they put a russian dude at the head of the nsa . 
  it 's not like she was irreplaceable or especially qualified for the position either . 
  her education consists in a degree in ophthalmology . 
  the possible conflict of interest is obvious , there were thousands of better choices , but the left does n't give two fucks so long as it benefits their image and earns them votes . 
  more than anti-uk tendencies what i generally see here are anti-anti-eu tendencies . 
  the uk just happens to often make the news for its anti-eu tendencies . 
  i hope at the end of got we find out the others are actually the scots in an alternate universe, 
  out of place maybe , since at a quick glance it seems to be surrounded mostly by wooden houses , but the house in itself looks lovely and not tacky to me -- i 'd definitely inhabit the shit out of it . 
  guess the stereotype might hold some truth then , haha . 
  lol either it 's the italian in me speaking , or you posted a bad example , because i do n't see the supposed tackiness in that building . 
  it looks expensive sure , but that 's not uncommon architecture or something you 'd consider weird or out of place here , see for example some of the houses at the sides of [ this ] ( https://maps.google.com/maps?q=viale+principe+amedeo,+rimini,+italy&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=44.069933,12.575166&amp;spn=0.002394,0.00449&amp;sll=44.0681,12.577243&amp;sspn=0.019025,0.03592&amp;oq=rimini+italy+viale+princi&amp;hnear=viale+principe+amedeo,+rimini,+emilia-romagna,+italy&amp;t=m&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=44.069933,12.575166&amp;panoid=ocemnla5f8nhvphtrqpjra&amp;cbp=12,55.64,,0,2.37 ) road . 
  anyway yep , i 'm aware of those terms too . 
  imagine my surprise when i found out i spent my childhood killing goombas on my snes . 
  that 's funny , in italy we sometimes use the word `` americanata '' for things that are kitsch , unnecessarily grandiose , and in bad taste . 
  if someone had taken hitler for one of those maybe wwii could have been avoided, 
  in that case , what 's all the fuss really about ? 
  i see nothing wrong with this system . 
  if it just gives the option to those who want their internet filtered to have it , i 'd see it as a service improvement . 
  i have to be honest , i definitely do n't doubt france has some really great architecture , but i never understood the appeal of the eiffel tower in particular . 
  as far as i 'm concerned it 's pretty nice at night when it 's all lighted up , but plain ugly during the day . 
  i 'm aware i must be in a tiny minority since it 's regarded as a masterpiece , but i just do n't see it . 
  love ratman !, 
  i think italoman would be always impeccably dressed in a tux and own several sports cars , but also tragically in debt , partly because of said sports cars . 
  as far as equipment goes for italy i was thinking maybe an infinite-spaghetti whip . 
  once it 's wrapped around the victim 's neck the victim can choose to either be strangled to death or try and eat it , but more keeps coming out from the handle and you ca n't stop till you 're stuffed full and dead with spaghetti pouring out of every orifice . 
  his fatal weakness could perhaps be its naivete , which would lead to him often being easily conned into taking advice from some of the shrewdest mafiosi it was supposed to fight . 
  well , nowadays it 's not like it 's a matter of feeding on the ignorant like it might have been decades ago . 
  everyone and their dog is aware of the long term effects of smoke now , and if they were n't it 's now even written in huge letters on every single pack they buy , so ... if people want to inflict that on themselves , they should be free to do so , and there 's no reason for them to pay a tax on their free choice . 
  social taxes are supposed to correct behaviors that cause harm to people other than the subject . 
  but if that is not the case ... 
  actually , i remember reading a study some time ago according to which smokers are already a net profit to the state by a good margin , since even though on one hand they cost more for public health care , on the other they die earlier and the state saves much more on their pensions . 
  i 'll see if i can find it . 
   do you have to answer a question about politics or 1970s music before it lets you purchase ? 
  haha that would be awesome . 
  people queuing behind the machine helping each other to solve the quiz to have access to cigs ... definitely adding to the list of things i 'm making mandatory if i ever become president . 
  but yea , as goerz said , i use the national health service smartcard . 
  never seen anyone using driver 's license or credit card , but having never tried with those myself they might work as well for all i know . 
  generally only 5 and sometimes 10 $ notes cause there 's a limited amount of change they can give back , but yup . 
  pain in the ass when i need to buy smokes on sunday when everything 's closed , as vending machines still reject them . 
  other than that they 're pretty cool , i guess . 
  amateurs, 
   i would not be that sure , that if italy was turned into a monarchy , berlusconi would not be elected as a king . 
  he would not , or he would not last anyway . 
  most of those who do n't vote for him do n't just simply dislike him or prefer another party over his , they hate him with a passion . 
  and even when elected he 's gotten a relative majority , not an absolute one . 
  i think the argument he 's making is that you can choose one model or the other , but if you choose the ` hate speech ' one you should make sure that it 's equally enforced to everyone . 
  i 'm not sure if you 're being sarcastic , but propaganda 2 really did exist , and berlusconi 's name * was * found on the list of its members in the 70s . 
  in particular licio gelli , former p2 head , had [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/licio_gelli#2003_interview ) to say about berlusconi :  in 2003 , gelli told la repubblica that it seemed that the p2 `` democratic rebirth plan '' was being implemented by silvio berlusconi :  every morning i speak to my conscience and the dialogue calms me down . 
  i look at the country , read the newspaper , and think : `` all is becoming a reality little by little , piece by piece . 
  to be truthful , i should have had the copyright to it . 
  justice , tv , public order . 
  i wrote about this thirty years ago ... berlusconi is an extraordinary man , a man of action . 
  this is what italy needs : not a man of words , but a man of action . 
  more info on [ p2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propaganda_due ) , [ other members found on licio 's list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propaganda_due#notable_people_on_gelli.27s_list ) ( including bankers and several generals of the army and intelligence , and 44 mps ) , and the sort of influence it could have easily exerted can be found on wikipedia - though the italian one is a bit more detailed . 
  also , [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/ricevuta_di_pagamento_per_l%27iscrizione_del_dott._silvio_berlusconi_alla_loggia_massonica_p2.gif ) is the payment receipt for one of berlusconi 's annual membership fees . 
  well , if nothing else he sure was pretty [ goo ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/2003/e/gallerie/politica/berluscfotoined/interni54031562110103721_big.jpg ) d [ looking ] ( http://images.virgilio.it/sg/notizie1024/upload/ogg/oggi-berlusconi-3.jpg ) back in his days, 
  you know what ? 
  as much as i despise him with all my heart and how happy i 'd be to just see him hanged for all the damage he 's done , i wish that on his death bed he left an autobiography complete with a detailed confession of all the shit he 's done - stuff that must have passed under the radar included . 
  this guy knows no limits and it 's obvious that he does n't shy away from bold moves . 
  i bet it would make one hell of a movie . 
  fatalistic , not fantastic ... tricked me too at first . 
  if you 're also into prog rock try checking out new trolls . 
  couple examples [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49nvp_fv5xo ) and [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kljvnnpc2xg ) . 
  have you seen our flag ? 
  our flag sucks man . 
  it 's a fucking [ green triangle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:regione-emilia-romagna-stemma.svg ) in resemblance of the shape of the emilia-romagna region ... yay creativity , right ? 
  most uninspired flag ever conceived . 
  who would even request that shit ? 
  i was wondering , assuming they achieved independence , how 's national debt going to be split ? 
   lmao @ them downvoting me you seem surprised ... not sure what you were expecting exactly coming in / r/europe and calling people eurotrash . 
  to be fair , by no means do i condone these actions , but assigning the task of making italian citizenship easier to obtain to the first black minister the country 's ever had ... that 's just plain asking for trouble to happen with the people . 
  it 's like if they put mr. vladimir ivanov , first generation naturalized american citizen who 's spent the first half of his life in russia , at the head of the cia , and * then * he started promising and calling for more transparency and the loosening of excessive security . 
   in any way , make your point clear and do n't make up sayings by fictional roman emperors well , allow me to rephrase then : careful before you hastily assume that just because your country has been able to absorb refugees with no consequences in the past , it 's going to be able to forever , as the context could be very different today ; for all you know you might be approaching the tipping point of the curve where applying the same policy would lead to things start going downward . 
  there are in fact many factors that could , hypothetically , make it a very different situation from the past . 
  just off the top of my head : the number of refugees already accomodated , the fact that as decades have passed physical mobility has become easier for aspiring emigrants , the very different economical situation in all your neighboring european countries , and so on and so forth . 
  first of all , thank you very much for the ad hominem , much appreciated . 
  second , that 's way besides my point . 
  the analogy i was trying to make , as i tried to highlight with my choice of the name of the roman emperor , concerned the naivete in blindly assuming that something that 's worked for you in the past must continue to do so forever -- not the morality of that `` something '' . 
  finally , i think the humanitarian spirit shown by sweden to be undoubtedly commendable . 
  i also think however that someone 's got ta play devil 's advocate here , this whole post is turning into a much , much worse circlejerk than the original on / r/worldnews - where if nothing else you can find all kinds of opinions upvoted and way more space left for discussion . 
  * `` duude , let 's keep expanding . 
  what can possibly go wrong ?
