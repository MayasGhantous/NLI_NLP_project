  and you know what , since it 's you guys and i 'm feeling generous , european love yadda yadda , i 'll throw in half our awesome weather too . 
  and berlusconi . 
  oh god i was just thinking the other day -- you know what your country really needs ? 
  a berlusconi !, 
  what with germans being humorless and all , have a clown in your politics too !, 
  so ... deal ? 
  in reality , dude just wanted an rc plane for his kid, 
  whoa whoa whoa , stop , stop right there !, 
  austerity is enough , do n't you dare come and steal even our few good stereotypes now , get your fucking own !, 
  and we 'll all have to thank the irresponsible countries that never signed or ratified the kyoto protocol like china and especially america for that . 
  in europe we 've already been sustaining significant economical costs just to keep our emissions down for a while now , which increases our production costs raising our prices and hurting our competitivity on international markets ... but when shit eventually hits the fan we 'll all have to pay for it just as much as the countries who took advantage of the situation and did n't give a single fuck . 
  looks like in italy shadow more or less follows the [ apennine mountains ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:italia_fisica_appennini.png ) line across the country . 
  not surprised , in my experience italy 's never liked italy very much , you 'll find plenty of self-loathe over here ... and this is something that far predates the crisis of the last few years . 
  so yea great news , even greece is a better idea than italy apparently ... 
  sort of , my father is sicilian but i was born and raised in bologna . 
  but yea , while it 's controversial whether the north would benefit from a hypothetical separation or not , objectively the south only stands to lose , no matter how you look at it . 
  so yep , i would n't expect any support for northern independence to come from south either . 
  well , i think in the northern league 's case with independence it 's also a matter of who is proposing it rather than what is being proposed , as in the proponents ' idiocy is being transferred onto the cause they support in the eyes of the public . 
  i myself am on the fence on the matter , but if it was supported by a party that was n't racist , bigoted , and who did n't make it their mission to display their over the top ridicolous antics at every other occasion , i think the idea itself would be seen in a slightly more positive light . 
  that poor dude has a daughter and had also just seen his wife die ( of cancer , iirc ) two months ago ... :(, 
  it 's ok . 
  besides , it 's still quite early in the morning , ca n't really blame you , 
  why ? 
  i was n't around in the 70s, 
  never seen a non-qwerty keyboard here . 
  well , m5s 's program does include free wi-fi internet coverage on all of italy , if i remember right ... 
  i think you got confused . 
  a quarter of 12 is 3 . 
  also , [ this ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=second+trimester ) . 
   dogs : main intercourse you mean `` main course '' i hope . 
  or , well , i 'm not sure what to hope on this one . 
  nice of you to feed the hivemind what it wants to hear , but barely anyone in italy thinks germany is the reason of all our problems , just that they 've been aggravating them by advocating austerity . 
  italy 's number one dislike are still our own politicians by far ; and that is why so many voted for a party that was built from scratch like grillo 's -- because they were hoping that by doing so they 'd be able to do away with our old corrupt politicians , which has been his selling point from way before his anti-eu stances . 
  playing devil 's advocate here . 
  artistic and historical value aside , one could argue that those pictures are probably worth more money in the long term by providing a stable income as tourist attraction than they would by being sold . 
  the money can * then * be used to organize charity and whatnot . 
  well , for starters , he decided to refuse the golden cross to keep wearing his old iron one at his neck . 
  it 's not much more than a symbolic gesture , but it 's a start i guess . 
  northern italians are the ones who won berlusconi the senate . 
  not all , but most of the people i know who have voted for 5sm did so because they were taking pd 's victory and pdl 's overwhelming loss for granted , and thought grillo would be doing great in the opposition ; few of those i asked actually wanted his party to lead . 
  then again my social circle is pretty much young people in emilia-romagna ( which is historically left wing ) , so i ca n't say my sample is sure to be representative of the general population . 
  can you make space for two ? 
  projections supposedly take that into account as well , so ... no . 
  unfortunately . 
  do n't look at me , in emilia-romagna we 're doing it right edit : if anyone wants to have an idea regarding how different italian regions are voting : [ http://www.google.it/elections/ed/it/results] ( http://www.google.it/elections/ed/it/results ), 
  yup . 
  increased exports mean there 's more demand for greek products ( good , more money flowing in ) , while decreased imports can be a consequence of either a higher quota of greece 's internal demand going into its own production ( good , money stays in ) or a symptom of greece 's decreased purchasing power , or a combination of both . 
  but as a rule of thumb , you want to maximize the difference between export and import and keep a positive trade balance . 
  edit : uh , sorry , for whatever reason i thought you wanted an explanation . 
  been staying up all night studying and my brain is slowing down . 
  i do n't know , western values nowadays frown upon violence in all of its forms , and with the good that this implies also comes the near impossibility of system-changing revolutions ... 
  i do n't think you can base predictions on past societies in different environments , so to speak . 
   althans said that , though german police had concrete proof of $ 8 million ( $ 11 million ) in gambling profits from the match fixing , this was probably the tip of the iceberg . 
  one has to wonder what it is about smiths that made them tirelessly reproduce like there was no tomorrow . 
  if it helps understanding the situation over here , he 's always had the following factors to help guarantee him success : - charisma . 
  that man undeniably has a way with words . 
  - media empire : press , and the most popular italian tv channels to spread his propagandistic bullshit 24/7 - popular soccer team ( ac milan ) & related brainless fandom and , most importantly : - fragmented and divided opposition : even in the past , polls have shown that he was the italians ' least favored choice by a large margin , but the opposing votes were being dispersed on too many different parties . 
  basically , pretty much all the votes his party did n't get directly were votes of people who would have rather had * anyone but him * as prime minister . 
  if he gets re-elected i swear i 'm leaving this shithole for good as soon as i 'm done with my degree . 
  for fuck 's sake , as the saying goes fool you once shame on him , fool you twice shame on you ( & his media empire ) ; but fool you 4 times over just do us a favor and go fucking shoot yourself and stop dragging the rest of us down with you you brainless idiot . 
   weirdest translation i 've heard is `` ma\u0142pa '' ( monkey ) for the symbol '' @ '' ( cause it looks like monkey with long tail ) . 
  in italy we call that `` chiocciola '' , which is the italian for snail , cause of the resemblance with the spiral of a snail shell as seen from above . 
  you know , for all the `` we 're in real deep shit '' piigs-related talk we 've been getting constantly in the last few years around here in italy , i would have thought we were being a huge drain on the eu . 
  turns out we 're one of the major contributors instead . 
  nice to see a positive graph about italy for a change . 
  i guess my wishing as a northern italian that merkelreich was really a thing is testament to the accuracy of italy according to italians , huh ... 
  for any non-italian who would like a translation : ** pic 1 - ** they suffered immigration - now they live in reserves !, 
  ** pic 2 - ** wake up padanian ! ^ 1 - with northern league , against thieving rome ^ 2 ** pic 3 - ** guess who comes last ? 
  - for rights on : housing , work , health care for context : ^ 1 padanian = a term they coined for northern italian ( lit . 
  inhabitant of the padan plain ) ; ^ 2 roma ladrona is one of their mottos , since the state ( which rome stands for ) allegedly drains resources from the north and wastes/redistributes them to the south . 
  it 's got nothing to do with roma people , for those wondering . 
  with all the press and televisions he 's got his hands on , one could almost say it 'd be mind blowing if that was n't the case . 
  also , say what you want about him , but the man has a natural ability at charming the masses with words ... unlike anyone in his opposition , with the possible exception of grillo - who belongs to a party that is being built from scratch though . 
  just the other day on servizio pubblico he was talking his usual bullshit , but man if i did n't know better i 'd be almost convinced . 
  do n't think in this case the mafia 's got anything to do with it . 
  just the gov ' t continuing its policy of trying to collect money from anywhere they can to try and keep our humongous debt somewhat in check i 'd say . 
  though yea , it could be argued that more people might turn to mafiosi for untaxed garbage disposal , i guess . 
  dude wtf . 
  tortellini out of all dishes is like a religion here in bologna ... that alone would be enough to warrant several sentences to spaghetti-hanging until you get tired of eating all the ropes or die of indigestion, 
  reminds me of that time i was in sweden on a high school exchange program and at lunch students there were queueing in front of a ketchup dispenser to put it on their lasagne . 
  the accusation seems completely unsubstantiated . 
  all the evidence i 've seen linked does n't show those refugees described as being abused in media . 
  that includes op 's evidence in the comment section of his post . 
  50 million is just 3.6 % of their population , though . 
  http://imgur.com/mgwqraw you dropped a table , 
   unlike many other countries none of which in europe , pretty much -- in fact , in its unrestricted form , jus soli is only widespread in the american continent . 
  in france , germany , uk , ireland jus soli does exist but it is applied only under certain specific conditions :  ** france ** : children born in france ( including overseas territories ) to at least one foreign parent who is also born in france automatically acquire french citizenship at birth . 
  children born to foreign parents may request citizenship depending on their age and length of residence ( see french nationality law ) . 
   ** germany ** : an exception to the increasing restrictiveness toward birthright citizenship , germany , prior to 2000 , had its nationality law based entirely on jus sanguinis . 
  now , children born on or after 1 january 2000 to non-german parents acquire german citizenship at birth if at least one parent has a permanent residence permit ( and had this status for at least three years ) and the parent was residing in germany for at least eight years . 
   ** ireland ** : on 1 january 2005 , the law was amended to require that at least one of the parents be an irish citizen ; a british citizen ; a child of a resident with a permanent right to reside in ireland ; or be a child of a legal resident residing three of the last four years in the country ( excluding students and asylum seekers ) ( see irish nationality law ) . 
   ** united kingdom ** : since 1 january 1983 , at least one parent must be a british citizen or be legally `` settled '' in the country ( see british nationality law ) . 
  itsub : europeans getting defensive whenever an american-flaired user dares to say something about europe that does n't make our euroego warm and fuzzy,
