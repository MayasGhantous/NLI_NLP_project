  day after the headline you 've got 60 million people in black shirts raising statues of mussolini . 
  if we dropped them back off in libya , we would be ordered again by the echr to pay each migrant 15k $ for damages . 
  wtt 2 good weather 1 good food for 2 good economy, 
  go around yelling pizza was invented in new york, 
  yes . 
  if they are turned away and deported to somewhere deemed not safe , like libya in the precedent we know of , the echr awards them damages . 
  the deported migrants do . 
  it probably was 5000 lire . 
  the exchange was 1 $ = 1936.27 lire . 
  i went looking for a [ source ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/4429197/japans-sewers-paved-with-gold.html ) because that did n't sound quite right  the unexpected presence of soaring levels of gold in sewage has been attributed to the high concentration of precision equipment manufacturers using the precious metal in the nagano region . 
  [ i mean ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rcyktgx.png ) ... it 's technically the * sub * title , but this is benign editorialisation at most , if you can even call it that . 
  it does n't skew perception and it 's more informative than the title . 
  til they do n't half-ass their drugs in germany, 
  i know fuck all about which one is ultimately worse for your health , but an argument could be made that at least your body has clear unambiguous ways to signal when it 's had too much alcohol .

  i do n't know , if the only ones singing in english were the english , they 'd have the unfair advantage of being the only ones to be understood . 
  on the other hand , if your lyrics are utter uninspired crap , the rest of us have the option to not tell anyone and keep them in our own secret language . 
  like our guys did . 
  good job guys . 
  edit : checking san marino on yt now and we really should have sent them a memo . 
  good god . 
  had they mocked him on the basis of his momma being fat i would agree with you , but i do n't see anything unprofessional in mocking a mep for not keeping their word . 
  the ability to stick to one 's own word , particularly when respecting it is completely within their control , is relevant to the job of an elected representative because it tells us about their good faith . 
  having a weak military is not the way to evolve into a peaceful world . 
  unilaterally weakening your military actually raises potential for war because it opens windows of opportunity . 
  the positive kind of demilitarization that actually reduces conflict in the world does n't happen through unilateral decisions , but through internetional treaties with the cooperation of all the different players . 
   aarre ( treasure ) if i 've ever seen a word that looks coined by a pirate ... 
  there 's good points in favor of it , but i do n't see that as one of them . 
  a war between member states is not going to happen in the foreseeable future either way , and the `` world '' already knows it without need for further convincing . 
   i 'd actually like to learn italian . 
  if you 're interested , [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/italianlearning/wiki/index ) 's a list of resources by / r/italianlearning, 
  he did choose poor phrasing , but given what the post asked , it 's relevant . 
  if one were asked to describe the typical american the answer would be white and fat , so , if the data is reliable , there seems indeed to be the wrong perception . 
   i eat tortellini with ketchup .

  it does n't necessarily mean he considers himself evil .

  and to make the thread come full circle , the italian for pope is apparently the [ mexican spanish for potato ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/30yjzr/various_ways_to_say_potato_in_latvian/cpx33nd ) . 
  and as you yourself pointed out , you 'd still be able to . 
  the objective is n't necessarily to eliminate downvotes completely , but to reduce them significantly ; subreddit style changes could be good enough for that . 
  ^ ( millennium * - millennia is plural ), 
   the reasons are multiple , one could argue that the vast plains , farmlands , temperate to mediterrannean climates allow for an easier population growth through cheap healthy food , attractive climate for all tastes and cheaper housing . 
  those are all factors that hold true for italy as well , but our age demographics and birth rates resemble germany 's . 
   the natalistic policy of the french government is also one of the best in the world with multiple advantages to having numerous kids , the fact that education and health care cost next to nothing is also a big factor . 
  yep , that 's probably got more to do with it . 
  the italian plan makes abandoning the hr convention unnecessary to solve the migrant crisis . 
  asking out of agreements the moment they start being slightly inconvenient is terrible both for a nation 's credibility and for the credibility of international law in the world , which is a tool that should be cherished as our only chance to coordinate to move towards a better future ( which , needless to say , should be the endgame of healthy politics ) . 
  and , hey , going by that line of reasoning * you * have the power to solve the crisis in your country too : just stop giving a shit and shoot them in the face the moment they cross your border , no ? 
  thanks for your input , but [ we have a better plan ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4f1npg/italys_migrant_compact_proposal_to_curb/d255iic )  tool to overrule national governments . 
  no shit ? 
  if you do n't want to be bound by anything other than your national government you might want to start figuring out how to move the uk to the moon . 
  you 're talking out of your ass . 
  the issue is not just whether we 'd be criticized across europe again . 
  the `` problem '' is the echr . 
  we 'd still be fined for each migrant we turned back . 
  if you want to solve this `` problem '' , get your country to push for changing international law . 
  either way do n't shift the blame on italy for this decision , because it 's not up to us .

  lol . 
  :p cloning is n't really my concern here , i 'm more worried about what information they could become able to extract from it in the future as biology and data science make progress ( e.g. 
  crossing it with other data to better predict behavior ) . 
  there 's no taking it back once you 've given it away after all , and i 'm not excited at the prospect of having to rely on corporations ' benevolence here . 
  as i said , it 's likely that i 'm being overly careful anyway ; but i 'm more creeped out by that ( albeit unlikely ) scenario than i am curious about my origins . 
  yeah , i 've thought about doing that before . 
  maybe - probably - i 'm being overly careful , but i do n't feel very comfortable handing my dna data to google co-founder 's ex-wife . 
  we need a novelty account that reads / r/europe 's comments out loud with thick national accents . 
  honestly i do n't see the reason to be mad or take it as an insult , it was an x-post from / r/vexillology , people there redesign flags for fun all the time . 
  [ referenced post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/moldova/comments/4d2j77/xpost_de_pe_rvexillology_redesign_pentru_flagul/ ) , by the way . 
  nothing wrong with finnish pizza specifically , [ but ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2tej7v/til_in_2005_the_italian_prime_minister_berlusconi/ )  til in 2005 the italian prime minister , berlusconi , insulted finnish cuisine and joked that finns ate `` marinated reindeer '' . 
  in 2008 , finland won an international pizza contest , beating italy . 
  the name of the winning pizza was `` pizza berlusconi '' which was made of smoked reindeer . 
  which , tired stereotypes aside , is still more reliable than a volkswagen , audi , bmw or mercedes .

  well , to put it in perspective , the entire smartphone market in europe is worth [ around $ 67.2 b ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/412145/global-smartphone-sales-value-global-region/ ) ( 14.5 +52.7 ) annually , vs around $ 24.3 b ( 9.3 +6.8 +5.7 +1.8 +0.7 ) of the drugs market . 
  i for one am pretty impressed , would probably be even more if we compared profit margins . 
  i do n't think of the netherlands as irrelevant at all , but googling this real instituto elcano think tank only returns results in spanish , including a half page long wikipedia article . 
  the index they 're using does n't seem all that popular either ... 
  yes ?

  why ? 
  as long as you are careful to interpret the data for what it is , it does retain informational value about their generation 's desires . 
  way to miss the point . 
  he did n't say that it does n't happen . 
  i 'm not convinced by that argument . 
  let 's suppose that there was a tribe whose written language used an alphabet made of differently placed circles ; the rules also prescribe that each circle has to be filled with a symbol , but the meaning is independent from the specific symbol chosen and only conveyed through how circles containing the same symbol are placed in relation to each other . 
  under your model , would that be proof that it can be classified as a genre rather than a language , because it can be written using symbols belonging to many different languages ? 
  as a bolognese , i would n't call bologna dirty , but i do n't think it deserves a special mention for cleanliness either .
