  i agree about the uk . 
  i meant that they are among the most developed . 
  sure they beat any eastern european country . 
  the netherlands and all the nordic states sum at about half of france 's population . 
  hence `` significant population '' . 
  among countries with a significant population yes , definitely . 
  to be fair , in the case of ireland gni is much more relevant than gdp . 
  asking them to speak french ( or italian , or whatever ) and respect the laws of the country and the country itself can hardly be called disintegration . 
  gypsy is racist ? 
  since when ? 
  for the euphemism , i meant using `` no country really likes '' instead of `` people hate '' gypsies . 
  to use an euphemism , no country in europe * really * likes gypsies . 
  well , most companies were start-ups at the beginning . 
  yeah , why should they integrate ? 
  yes , but they did not join to begin with . 
  a * memorial * would not say '' `` eternal glory to heroes who fell in the struggle against the german fascist invader for the freedom and independence of the soviet union '' . 
  a memorial would be of remembrance , not of honor , and it would not call for eternal glory . 
  in italy we had a civil war and the country was split in two after 1943 , with the north occupied by the nazi and then liberated with the efforts of the allies and the partisans . 
  that is why the monuments make sense : we gave up , and were invaded by the nazi . 
  the south , which was taken by the allies before the armistice , does not have such memorials . 
  also , the behavior of the allies in italy was immensely more human than the behavior of the red army in italy , and the allies did not force 1/4 of the country to stay underneath an oppressive regime for 40 years . 
  words juggling ? 
  a cemetery is equal to a monument ? 
  in france there are cemetery for the german soldiers who died in wwii , but there are no monuments celebrating them . 
  in italy we have the cemetery to austrian soldiers in merano , but we do not have monuments celebrating them . 
  also , it says right on the side , `` eternal glory to heroes who fell in the struggle against the german fascist invader for the freedom and independence of the soviet union '' , if that is not a celebratory monument i do not know what it is . 
  it 's a cemetery . 
  not a celebratory monument . 
  can you see the difference between the two ? 
  one thing is to respect the remnants of your enemies , another to honor them . 
  there is a monument to the invading german army ? 
  care to provide a link ? 
  plenty of monuments to german soldiers in moscow . 
  yes , but not if the event is in the honor of a person . 
  if i went to an event as a regular guy , the politician would get a preferential treatment . 
  if i went as the focus of the event , he would not . 
  [ samantha cristoforetti ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samantha_cristoforetti ) [ quirinale ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quirinal_palace ) [ mattarella ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sergio_mattarella ), 
  so you mean that if , i do not know , samantha cristoforetti is invited to eat from mattarella at the quirinale , they will not be treated as equal ? 
  as a hero ? 
  where ? 
  i mean , he was a good poet , but we were taught how much of an asshole he was . 
  if it was a snack it should have been a snack for all involved . 
  politicians do not , usually , get better treatment in events in which they are not the main focus . 
  no , not really . 
  even if i did , an 8-years-old musings about geography can hardly be classified as national concerns . 
  national media never do . 
  there might be some fringe groups , but i 've never heard of them . 
  we basically never talk about corsica . 
  yeah , but it still happens . 
  languages use different words for the same thing . 
  why at games you guys scream hup , holland , hup ? 
  is the team only from the two provinces ? 
  why is you official government tourism [ website ] ( http://www.holland.com/ ) holland.com ? 
  eh , it 's a synecdoche . 
  kinda like england or britain for united kingdom . 
  plus mine were not examples of a different pronunciation , but of completely different words . 
  italy , but if another language were to say sicily , ehi , your language , your words . 
  i do n't call ireland eire , germany deutschland , china zhonggu\u00f2 , japan nippon , and i do not care if in poland they call italy w\u0142ochy . 
  do you say griekenland or ell\u00e1da ? 
  [ hdi : italy 27th , latvia 46th ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_human_development_index ) . 
  mexico 's worse i think . 
  i agree . 
  which is what i meant when i said that , despite there being cultural differences between people from latin america and people from the united states , there is much more common ground between them than between people from europe and people from mena . 
  exactly . 
  they are definitely closer to you than mena is to us . 
  the us culture is more rooted in protestantism and individualism ; central america is more rooted in catholicism and collectivism . 
  compare italy and spain with germany and the uk . 
  you can say one situation is better than another . 
  also i live in the us , i 'm not just talking because of things i have heard . 
  no , not perhaps . 
  definitely closer . 
  about 25 % of the us has been catholic since the '60s - way before the hispanic immigration wage . 
  irish , italians , polish immigrants also came from very catholic countries . 
  also , of course we are talking relatively , we are doing a comparison . 
  i do not know where did you got the idea that i said the us should just accept and give amnesty to all illegal immigrants . 
  yes but the us are more violent that europe overall . 
  again , i am not saying that illegal immigration to the us is not an issue , i am saying that the average illegal in the us is much better than the average illegal in europe - comparatively less violent and more productive . 
  they definitely are more close to you guys than the mena immigrants are to europe , come on . 
  you can not really deny that . 
  we have gotten [ 1.3 million ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911 ) in 2015 alone , and this is only including people who registered . 
  on the other hand , there is no debate on the net drag of illegal immigrants on the european economy . 
   so why has n't your country offered to take in a few million of these people ? 
  i do n't know , really . 
  might be that they are not refugees for the most part or do not even want to come to europe . 
  lem me call renzi real quick and ask him . 
  my point btw was not that you guys do not have an immigration problem ; is that i would love to swap our problem with yours . 
  thing is , and this is one of the few real cases of american exceptionalism i can think of , that those 10s of millions illegals tend to [ give more to the country than they receive . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_impact_of_illegal_immigrants_in_the_united_states#cost-benefit_analysis ) also , being closer to you guys in culture , they integrate way more easily . 
  i wish europe had the immigration problem the us have . 
  damn scots , they ruined scotland !, 
  shit 's about to go down . 
  [ there you go . 
  my money 's on spain . 
  the dataset did not include bulgaria . 
  again , i did not write * all * european countries . 
  the dataset included these countries . 
  day . 
  noodles , made with various different flours , none of which came from durum wheat , were created in china . 
  pasta as we know it , with hundreds of shapes and made from durum weath , was invented in italy . 
  noodles were probably invented in italy too , independently .
