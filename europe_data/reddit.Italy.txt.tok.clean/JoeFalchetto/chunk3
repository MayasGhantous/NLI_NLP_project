  dunno what do you mean by `` the world '' , because lots of people associate pizza with the classic margherita ; tomato sauce , and mozzarella . 
  i never wrote that all the countries were here . 
  it 's between germany and switzerland . 
  also you forgot tomatoes . 
  payback 's a bitch . 
  i actually kinda am , since [ berlusconi himself ] ( http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2016-01-20/unioni-civili-berlusconi-apre-adozioni-gay-stato-non-s-opponga--192112.shtml?uuid=acfbfrdc ) said he was in favor of them .

  io nun songo difficultuso ; ma luv\u00e0mmel ' ' a miezo st ` uso s\u00ec , va buono : comme vu\u00f2 tu .

  european per capita consumption is [ much smaller ] ( http://www.uark.edu/ua/ricersch/pdfs/per_capita_rice_consumption_of_selected_countries.pdf ) when compared to the rest of the world . 
  when in italy , every day , about 120 grams . 
  there are people that eat it every meal , and people that never eat it ... it depends , really . 
  the one by unapfa . 
  25 kg per year is not even that much , it 's ~ 70g per day . 
  i assume there are foods you eat more that 70g per day . 
  the rag\u00f9 alla napoletana * da ' una pista * to the rag\u00f9 alla bolognese . 
  i love bekri meze , xorta , tirokafteri , saganaki , tzaziki , moussaka , melitzanosalada , taramosalada , among others .

  the title does not say * all european countries * . 
  the unafpa . 
  bread can stand on its own . 
  potatoes , right ? 
  the dataset i used only had those countries ( for europe ) .

  that 's like outing an homophobic politician . 
  attractive to russia , not to the buyers . 
  uk is less than 200 years old ? 
  thank you . 
  oh i did not mean to imply they all died , i meant it had a significant effect on their society . 
  yes , but i think most countries have seen their population recover . 
  ireland has not . 
  [ see this friedman video . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtpgkx588nm ), 
  as of right now , maybe , given how strong the euro has been recently . 
  but germany has been for a long time against any kind of qe . 
  in general , germany benefits of a euro which makes its exports more competitive than they should be within the eurozone . 
  germany . 
  i do not see how dies this question relate with what i wrote . 
  yes but let 's be real , with the mark your trade would not be balanced . 
  so , antifa . 
  which i also hate as a term , because i am deeply antifascist myself , but i want nothing to do with these idiots . 
  luxembourg-andorra-vatican city coalition . 
   any european country,

  they remind me of british unions in the '70s . 
  oh sorry i 'm on mobile !, 
  according to [ this ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/nor/#exports ) oil + gas are 57.6 % of norway 's exports . 
  i 'll take false equivalence for 200 , alex. 
  c u r r e n t y e a r u r r e n t y e a r, 
  my mistake !, 
  yes , but it 's way more anti-cameron . 
  if this is right or not i do n't know ( i do not really follow uk politics ) . 
  a woman converting to islam is like a jewish guy joining the fascist party . 
  had corbyn been accused of it , people would be all over this sub attacking the media . 
  nice mountains , but people are still real fucking anti-semitic . 
  it is not a very meaningful comparison if not adjusted for age . 
  is he ? 
  oh okay , that makes more sense . 
  churches are forced to marry gay couples ? 
  why ? 
  are all religions subject to the same obligation ? 
  i would guess that if you have carpeting you are more likely not to wear your shoes . 
  especially fans of kim jong un . 
  i thought it was the corrupt government and the rampant tax evasion . 
  it 's mostly a snow/not snow thing , i think . 
  i am southern italian , and we do not take our shoes off . 
  i lived in tennessee , and people did not take their shoes off . 
  i live in boston , and people do take their shoes off . 
  what 's the difference between canada and yoghurt ? 
  if you leave yoghurt alone for 140 years , it will develop a culture . 
  oh , so every single comment implies europe . 
  nice logic . 
  where in your comment says `` in europe '' ? 
   every place, 
  1.8 children/woman is below replacement rate .

  oh thank you !, 
  i saw it on mobile , so it did not show . 
  what 's the y-axis ? 
  he just posted them . 
  do you have stats for catholics ? 
  i am fucking terrified by football hooligans , i do not even go close to the stadium when there are games on . 
  and that is an example of people killed . 
  violence within a family is underreported , let alone among muslim families , which are both poorer than the average and have a more retrograde culture . 
  oh okay , you ai n't either , so neither of us know what the fuck we are talking about . 
  and there are no statistics regarding violence on women by religion to be found , but given women 's rights in the muslim world , i would not be surprised of a higher rate among muslim families . 
  mississippi would be between slovenia and slovakia .
