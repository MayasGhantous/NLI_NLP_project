  [ or , you know , manchester ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-27224496 ) . 
  yeah , also your muslims are handpicked among the upper classes . 
  i am not saying everyone is rich , i am saying it 's a rich country . 
  being poor in sweden and being poor in moldova is a different kind of poverty - especially given your safery net . 
  well , yeah , sweden is a rich country . 
   therefore , because they wished to dismantle this last part of feudalism they were leftists . 
  this has not been about whether classical liberals were leftists , but about whether leftists are classical liberals . 
  do not try to turn it over . 
  saying that classical liberals were leftists . 
  therefore current leftists are classical liberals , is ignoring the immense influence of marxism on left-wing ideology - unless you wan na say marx was a classical liberal because , all in all , he wanted equality . 
  also , saying that wanting the same thing means that two movements are the same is not correct either , because it is like saying that two given religions are the same thing because their intent is to bring salvation to the human spirit , without considering how do you get it . 
  also , again , modern left ( or social liberalism in general ) focuses on equality , classical liberalism focuses on freedom . 
  i repeat : the entire point of classical liberalism is to make the world freer first . 
  equality can come later . 
  and , i might add , not to expense of freedom . 
  saying that classical liberalism `` promotes '' free market is like saying that christianity `` promotes '' jesus being the son of god . 
  it 's not a promotion , it 's a fundamental of the ideology . 
  and , again , being against free-market , or in favor of big government , is completely incompatible with being a classical liberal . 
  have you even read the second treaty or wealth of nations ? 
  locke was christian , but smith was most likely atheist and ricardo was jewish . 
  i do not know where you got this idea . 
  both the second treaty of government and wealth of nations have a much greater emphasis on freedom than on equality . 
  the entire point of classical liberalism is to make the world freer first . 
  equality can come later . 
  the opposite is true for social liberalism . 
  if the modern left tries to make the world more equal by reducing economic freedom - as it often does - then it is not being true to classical liberalism . 
  which is fine , that 's not my point . 
  how is it irrelevant ? 
  they 're core tenents of classical liberalism !, 
  i quote wikipedia :  classical liberalism is a political ideology that values the freedom of individuals -- including the freedom of religion , speech , press , assembly , and markets -- as well as limited government . 
  so , it 's more about freedom of the individual than anything else . 
  not egalitarianism , freedom . 
  social liberalism , on the other hand :  social liberalism is a political ideology that seeks to find a balance between individual liberty and social justice . 
  john locke died way before the french revolution , smith published his masterpiece 13 years before it and died a year after , and ricardo saw no problem with people being poor as long as market efficiency got better . 
  i would not say that the current liberal left is in favor of the small-government , lasseiz-faire , and emphasis on economic freedom of classical liberalism . 
  there are social liberals and classical liberals . 
  the latter movement is older . 
  locke , smith and ricardo are classical liberal , i would not call them leftists . 
  yeah i was just answering to / u/neo24 who said parliamentar is more stable . 
  i think presidentialism is more stable . 
  might be biased since i 'm italian . 
  yes , for the oil , but they have the kind of inequality that makes the us look like a kibbutz . 
  [ this graph of their exports ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/tree_map_exports_2009_equatorial_guinea.jpeg ) gives you an idea of how well diversified their economy is . 
  you guys ( and the us , and canada ) have a much sensible immigration policy , given how you pick and choose . 
  well yeah but let us not kid ourselves thinking that on average democratic countries are not way less corrupted than non-democratic ones . 
  communist hierarchies in communist countries have been generally corrupt , i do not think that 's news . 
  sure , because that 's all communism is and has been . 
  yes but the 74.1 is overweight + obese ( i.e. 
  anyone above 25 ),

  yes . 
  given the amount of people that thing that 9/11 was orchestrated by the us/jews/illuminati , you might understand why calling 9/11 fake could raise some eyebrows . 
  yes , but i do not see how that makes 9/11 fake . 
  it makes the claim of wmds fake , not 9/11 . 
  and how is 9/11 related to iraq ? 
   faker than 9/11 wait what ? 
  i think that 's the point . 
  also , france is on fire in the cartoon . 
  it 's clear lady liberty 's going there to help .

  no , he started the expansions and the wars . 
  they continued after his death , as the arabs took over the former roman territories in eastern asia , north africa , and some areas of southern europe . 
  so if you change it to gdp per capita ? 
  64 % think it is not means that 36 % think it is . 
  hence , how large the majority . 
  if 36 % of italians thought that suicide bombings are justified , i 'd be really worried . 
  also , i doubt you have read the data . 
  us says 13 % * always * justified , 8 % sometimes . 
  total gdp is not a measure of how well the average citizen is doing , otherwise india would be way better off than monaco . 
  it 's a measure of the power of the economy on a global scale . 
  it 's endemic in the religion . 
  that 's the issue . 
  so it has a lot to do with the religion . 
  and yes , the majority . 
  how large this majority is , it 's [ debatable ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf#page=60 ),

  at the end of 2011 , an estimated 500,022 ( 57 % ) persons living with an hiv diagnosis in the united states were gay and bisexual men , or gay and bisexual men who also inject drugs .
