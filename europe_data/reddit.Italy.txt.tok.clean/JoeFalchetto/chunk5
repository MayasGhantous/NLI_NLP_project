  the refugees , yeah . 
  the immigrants , no .

  must be an italian thing then . 
  i mean in the process of crossing the border . 
  what happens if a border patrol is confronted by a group of illegals ? 
  most of the moderate rights parties in europe support israel . 
  most of the far right parties are antisemitic . 
  there 's a world of difference between forza nuova and forza italia . 
  what happens if they get caught , though ? 
  yeah , the egyptians too . 
  does not mean much as of now . 
  no , there is a host of factors that can lead to it . 
  i am not an expert in canon law , though , so do not take my word for it . 
  it has annulment which , by all intent and purposes , is the same thing . 
  and of course you do . 
  reminds you of yours ? 
  might be biased , but i like the [ italian naval flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/naval_ensign_of_italy.svg ) . 
  [ individualist vs collectivist cultures ] ( http://study.com/academy/lesson/individualistic-vs-collectivistic-cultures-differences-communication-styles.html ), 
  no , it 's not at all radical . 
  as a matter of fact , it 's the norm in the whole continent of europe . 
  are you arguing that for a thing to be banned , it needs to be offensive to someone ? 
  we do not use the term `` near east '' . 
  we call it medio oriente ( literally middle east ) . 
  [ depends on the definition you use . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_middle_east ), 
  well , no , not well before . 
  the first jews came in a significant number to europe after the destruction of the temple . 
  [ 66 % ] ( http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/sharialaworonelawforall.pdf ) of british muslims do not believe the shoah happened . 
  [ 55 % ] ( http://www.algemeiner.com/2015/06/30/adl-poll-shows-more-than-half-of-western-european-muslims-harbor-antisemitic-beliefs/#http://www.algemeiner.com/2015/06/30/adl-poll-shows-more-than-half-of-western-european-muslims-harbor-antisemitic-beliefs/# ) of muslims in europe are anti-semitic . 
  he was a conqueror . 
  literally spread islam through war . 
  he was a military leader , so not really peaceful . 
  it is also true that basically every time there are major religious clashes nowadays , islam is in the mix . 
  i have studied economics ... again , i am not saying he is wrong . 
  i am saying that this is not what he won a nobel prize in so while he knows a lot more than the average person ( or the average economist ) he 's still one of the world 's best cardiologist talking about your liver . 
  should i agree with james watson 's view on race and dna ? 
  yes , again , i agree . 
  i did not mean to sound dismissive . 
  i am just saying that maybe this his not his sector ( he won the nobel prize for asymmetric information in markets ) . 
  to be fair economics is a very vast subject . 
  ge still knows way more than the average person , but i do not go to a cardiologist for liver failure . 
  greece and spain in 2014 were slums ? 
  southern italy ? 
  come on , unemployment can not be the only indicator . 
  which part of it ? 
  i mean , you post on r/sas and r/ets and call yourself a comrade , you 're basically him on the left . 
  i do not think attitude towards the eu is the only determinant as far as left or right . 
  hasidic jews . 
  that is a / r/thathappened like the one of the woman speaking navajo at the walmart line . 
  good luck with that . 
  especially if you include goods * and services * . 
  yes , the colosseum was built as a new stadium in 1947 , then they had a roma-lazio game there in 1948 and it has looked this way since . 
   do you know how long it took within our own history to fully own up to ww2 and all the implications ? 
  less than what is taking for turkey . 
  i think they messed up [ here ] ( http://www.armenian-genocide.org/recognition_countries.html ) . 
  besides the simpsons , this reminds me of the [ ferd fteenthousand ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8p5vgcf-nu ) . 
   canyonero is that * the truck with four wheel drive , smells like a steak , and seats thirty five ? 
  not really , it 's ~ 12.5 % below 2 * low , and about 50 % of the before-collapse price . 
  doubt that , he does not even have 50 % of republicans who vote in primaries . 
   relatively for a good chunk of their history , at least , they were . 
  then they decided to start genociding . 
  i wish , at least the ottoman empire was relatively tolerant religion-wise . 
  very fat . 
  ethnically ? 
  ethnically , yes . 
  the ones born in 1924-1926 , probably also culturally . 
  both . 
  poland is 97 % polish , sk 98 % korean and japan 97 % japanese , ethnically . 
   productivity per hour worked is terrible christ you were right is [ below the eu average .

  he 's also on all their notes of 1rmb and above . 
  in russia , [ 58 % of adults ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/29/in-russia-nostalgia-for-soviet-union-and-positive-feelings-about-stalin/ ) see stalin 's historical role in either a `` very '' or `` mostly '' positive light . 
  if 50 % of marriages among white christians in the us were among first cousins there would be an outcry . 
   countries do n't just magically become civilized when/if they decide to give women suffrage or do something else comparable ... 
  i did not say a country is civilized because women can vote ( hell , women can vote here in china ) . 
  i am saying that a country is ** not ** civilized when women can ** not ** vote . 
  universal suffrage a necessary but not sufficient condition for being a civilized country . 
   usa is the opposite of a civilized nation got ya , you are one of those people . 
   barely worth mentioning it 's the reason divorce and abortion are legal in italy , and the reason we are not a monarchy . 
  it recently stopped a major constitutional reform and is the main reason we have to import nuclear power . 
  barely worth mentioning my ass . 
  the main reason it 's inefficient ( not unbalanced , quite the opposite , we might have * too many * balances ) it 's due to avoid a strong man to rise again . 
  you know , fascism and all that . 
  and i 'd rather have an inefficient system than one that forbids half the population from voting . 
  singapore system of government is the most efficient on earth , most likely ; i prefer mine . 
  you really need to learn about other countries political systems before spouting ignorant bullshit . 
  forbidding half the population the right to have a saying on public matters due to their genitalia has nothing to do with being civilized ? 
  you do know italy has referendums right ? 
  both on the local and on the national level . 
  why ? 
  the right to vote was granted to women immediately after fascism ended and according to [ the economist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democracy_index#democracy_index_by_country_.282016.29 ) are .02 points ( out of 10 ) from being `` full democracy '' , and mainly because our state is very inefficient . 
  except the routine torture , people going in jail for sodomy , lack of freedom of assembly and of speech , internet censorship ... it is pretty good in the context of the gulf states , but overall is bad . 
  alright . 
  alright . 
  both spellings are fine . 
  i actually think the majority of native english speakers uses the '' - ized '' one . 
  what a civilized bunch of people . 
   how is that different than rich and poor states in the us for example ?
