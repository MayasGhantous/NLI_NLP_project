  the scale of fiscal transfers . 
  americans pay about 19 % of their gdp into federal taxes , and the taxes paid by a californian tech-entrepreneur go to help a guy from a ghetto or a trailer park in mississippi . 
  in proportion it 'd be like the eu having a budget of eur2 .8 trillion . 
  eu funds do that somehow , but it 's not nearly to the level of 19 % of the eu gdp , plus there is not market-influenced currency movements to help poorer area become more competitive . 
  i am pro-eu but economically the euro was a mistake . 
  friedman , arguably the greatest monetary economist of the last 120 years , warned [ specifically about this . 
  ] ( https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-euro--monetary-unity-to-political-disunity ), 
  liechtenstein is a [ constitutional monarchy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/politics_of_liechtenstein ) . 
  they consistently use referendums to decide about laws . 
  the prince has veto power . 
  so does the queen of england . 
  [ they voted to reduce it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liechtenstein_constitutional_referendum,_2012 ) , but the referendum was lost by a large margin . 
  i would not compare it to spain and portugal , since they had a 30 + years ' dictatorship before , while liechtenstein did not . 
  the country is generally very regressive . 
  they still have some of the strictest abortion laws in the west . 
  yes , i noticed on reddit norther europeans say `` europe '' when they mean their country . 
  which is kinda like a canadian saying `` in north america is very cold '' . 
   it 's practically non-existent in private households in europe pretty common in italy . 
   western induced islamic terrorism right . 
  somehow it 's always the west fault . 
  islam got nothing to do with it . 
  that 's why it 's full of people from congo exploding themselves in brussels , and how can we forget the chilean that drove an airplane through the empire state building ? 
  the aboriginals shoot nightclubs in sydney on a monthly basis , and every other week a chinese terrorist kills a few people people in kyoto with a knife . 
  the wikipedia article is all about economic socialism , says nothing about social left-wing issues like freedom of religion , or gay and women 's rights . 
  and yes , in the us blacks are overwhelmingly democratic , but they are still more socially conservative than whites or asians . 
   how is allowing nazis to shout heil hitler relevant for your personal freedom ? 
  allowing chinese people to insult xi jinping is not relevant for my personal freedom either , does not mean it should not be allowed . 
  basically every country in europe has * unofficial * diplomatic relations with the roc . 
  the holy see is the only one with * official * diplomatic relations . 
  also , and perhaps more importantly , us , japan , and china have monetary sovereignty . 
  i am not saying it would be good if they did ( it would be disastrous ) but they could inflate the debt away . 
  it 's outside vatican city ( on italian soil ) but yes it 's there !, 
  ah cool !, 
  thank you !, 
  i think one party ( the currently elected party ) does and the other does not . 
  i agree , the issue is that it goes both ways and taiwan claims to be the rightful government of mainland china . 
  both countries follow the one china policy , as of the [ 1992 consensus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_consensus ) . 
   essentially an outlying part of modern rome ( across the tiber )  would not call them outlying , they 're in the center of modern rome . 
  they could be considered an outlying part of * ancient * rome . 
  the guardian [ can be a little shit sometimes ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/07/venezuela-not-greece-latin-america-oil-poverty ) . 
  the posters . 
  or [ this ] ( http://www.theonion.com/article/no-one-murdered-because-of-this-image-29553 ) . 
  the vast , vast majority ( 90 % + ) of the diaspora ( especially to the americas ) happened before 1922 so it would not surprise me that the diasporic italians have no clue of what it was like and tend to whitewash fascism due to misguided and borderline idiotic patriotism . 
  i have also noticed the whitewashing is incredibly more common among italians that went to argentina and brazil than among italians that went to the us and canada . 
  in italian republic is necessarily linked with the people deciding who is the ruler and voting - i.e. 
  with democracy ( usually indirect ) . 
  like , saying `` nazi germany was a republic '' would not make sense in italian . 
  or a dictatorship republic . 
  it was a republic as much as china is a republic . 
  the * italiani brava gente * is a myth as much as the * clean wehrmacht * . 
  while jews had a very high survival rate ( 80 % ) thanks mostly to the church , italy set up concentration camps in the colonies before germany did , bombed red cross hospitals , and killed tens of thousands in ethiopia with mustard gas . 
  even not considering what we did to our colonies , fascism enacted the * leggi razziali * , brought an unprepared country into the bloodiest war in history which eventually caused italy to be split in two with the upper half becoming a puppet government of the nazi and two years of bloody civil war . 
  not including , of course , dictatorship , curtailing of social and economic freedom , persecuting opponents and all the baseline issues that dictatorships have . 
  your view of italy is not much better than the stereotype you make fun of ... italy was not unified for various reasons - big ones being big chunks of it were in control of larger and more powerful countries , and having the stato della chiesa straight in the center - and being too rich and powerful was not one of these . 
   but that 's a fallacy . 
  of course we 're richer , more prosperous and more advanced as a society than we were back in 1946 !, 
  it 's only natural !, 
  had fascism not taken place or even lasted longer or had the monarchy be left in its place the same exact changes would 've gradually happened over time . 
   social change was - is - inevitable . 
  just look at spain and where it went from 1975 to this day . 
  same things can be said for what happened between 1861 and 1922 then , right ? 
   no , no pdr needed to give power to a dictator . 
  why would he needed to when the civil and military apparatuses were more than willing to send us back to fascism in 1964 and 1970 ? 
  who are we kidding ? 
  what does this have to do with it ? 
  if anything the fact that it did not happen speaks volumes about the strenght of democracy . 
  btw i might have misunderstood you . 
  if the king has to be only a figurehead ( like in england or spain ) it 's more acceptable than the king having power ( like in saudi arabia or north korea ) . 
  i still prefer an elected representative . 
  that in italy - the country we were talking about - monarchy was not that great . 
  also if we want to look at more than 2 countries i 'd say there is a pretty strong correlation between [ democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democracy_index ) and quality of life . 
   i think a king would be better than a powerless figurehead of a president who suddenly pretends to be non-partisan as soon as he gets elected and who 's the kind of guy no-one knows , remembers or even gives a fuck about . 
  i think it 's better to not have a powerful figure chosen by luck and genes who stays there until he dies . 
  i 'd rather have one we can change every 7 years . 
   fascism was 80 years ago . 
  mistakes were made , they paid for them , but it 's also high time we stop pretending nothing happened between 1861 and 1922 . 
  if we 're a country in the first place we owe it to the monarchy and whatever social progress ( abolition of the death penalty and decriminalisation of homosexuality with the penal code of 1890 , laicisation of the state , divorce ) we underwent under the republic can trace its roots back to that period . 
  yes , let us also not pretend nothing happened between 1946 and today . 
  italy is immensely more socially progressive than it was during the monarchy , starting with giving women the right to vote . 
  i fail to see how recognizing we are a country due to vittorio emanuele ii and wanting a monarchy back are related . 
  so far , no pdr gave power to a fascist dictator . 
  as gobetti once said , we unfortunately never had a liberal revolution in this country . 
   i 'll also have you know that most italians were actually fine with fascism for as long as it benefitted them ... it 's very disingenuous to say `` oh !, 
  but we were anti-fascist all along !, 
  bad king , it 's all your fault ! '', 
  because that simply is n't true . 
  it was n't true in 1946 - if it was , the republic would 've won a landslide victory - and it is n't true now . 
  i am not pretending to talk for all italians . 
  my father 's family lost everything due to fascism . 
  i have my own personal reasons to dislike the monarchy , besides country-wide ones . 
  the kingdom which lead us into fascism ? 
  you wrote  nazifascismo = nazi-fascist not nazifascist , it says so in the source itself . . 
  which source ? 
  `` nazi-fascist '' does not appear in the wikipedia page . 
  also nazi-fascist is the name of a person or an abjective , not the name of a political movement . 
  you canot say `` the liberation from nazi-fascist '' . 
  [ nazifascism ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazifascismo ) is a commonly used term in italian historiography and vernacular . 
  we elected a [ pornstar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ilona_staller ) and a [ terrorist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toni_negri ) as mep . 
  this is revisionism . 
  grandfather was a staffetta ; the only thing the partisans gave us was leverage at the post-war negotiations .
