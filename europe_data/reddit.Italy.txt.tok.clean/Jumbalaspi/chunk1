i knew it !, 
  it took the uk and istanbul 500 years to go back to catholicism . 
  and the orthodox church merged back , too . 
  are you german ? 
  now we need to know how it 's called in cuba . 
  maybe the `` italian '' , to go full circle, 
  i guess that there is n't an italian who does n't : eat pasta and pizza , drink wine , watch football , speak with the hands ... 
  he 's smarter than we thought . 
  and  spanish ( 20 million ) in some parts of the us you hear more people speaking spanish than english . 
  ah ok thanks, 
  it makes me wonder if you read the news at all . 
  putin supporters are everywhere and very vocal , but the major socialist parties have a clear stance in this issue . 
  for example , the leftmost party for the eu elections in italy supports the ukrainians . 
  former pm , but you are right . 
  can somebody explain if it is the maximum price a retailer would be charged when a customer pays with a card ? 
  i mean , if a customer buys something an pays with a card , the 0.07 $ are the effective price a retailer pays or there are other charges ? 
  we are better at being italians !, 
  you mean * irish coffee * , right ? 
  seeing that the situation can not get worse , we decided to change government every 15 days just to beat the world record and have something to be proud of . 
  the new government declared that we are all irish now because apparently renzi has irish origins . 
  hi fellow irishian , what about going to drink a glass of red ale while singing folk songs like `` chianti in the jar '' , `` seven pizza nights '' and `` the rocky road to rome '' ? 
   this healthcare socialism is sucking the freedom from my veeeeeeins yes but it 's doing it for free . 
  light pollution is an issue , but you need to know that the po valley is densely populated with a collection of small cities ( with some exception , like milan ) so the lightning is less concentrated . 
  yep , anyone could register and vote . 
  the site admins said that they removed the fake entries but i do n't know how they can distinguish between a real and a fake one ( you should have access to the list of people living in the region ), 
  the separatists are everywhere in italy , from the northern league to the sicilians , from the sardinians to the german-speaking region in alto adige . 
  that 's not the first `` poll '' that is made , it only made the news because of the crimean situation . 
  the world says that this story needs to stop being reposted , according to a poll i held in my house . 
  wow huge dip recently . 
  do you know what caused it ? 
  czech are euroskeptics ? 
  i did n't know that ... also , it does n't show in this map , with a 36 % and 42 % . 
  italians joke about the fictional region of molise : [ here ] ( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111226111529/nonciclopedia/images/9/9c/molise_in_una_mappa_fantasy.jpeg ) and [ here ] ( http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090127153017/nonciclopedia/images/e/e7/molise.jpg ) some examples . 
  some people claim to being born there . 
  lol . 
  ok , email apple and ask them to open the specifications and to license the connector for free , then reply me back when it 's done . 
  usb is not perfect , but it is the de facto standard . 
  if you want to improve a standard , you work with the other companies ( intel , ibm , microsoft , etc ) , you do n't create a new one with limited licensing . 
  different engines require different fuel , but the diesel fuel you buy is regulated and must adhere to some standard that somebody decided . 
  and this is for your own good . 
  different electrical devices require different power sources , so your vacuum uses a standard power outlet , your laptop uses a different connector ( that is not standard , sadly ) and your mobile devices should use a single standard connector , like your diesel car uses a standard fuel . 
  why not use / r/nl ? 
  i am italian and i ca n't see the problem here . 
  ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ got ^ ^ ^ 0 ^ ^ ^ gold ^ ^ ^ medals, 
  renzi wo n't be able to do anything because he needs a stronger parliamentary majority . 
  in the best case scenario , his government wo n't do any major reform . 
  in the worst case scenario , his government will last a couple of days . 
  we had a prime minister that i consider to be the best pm in the last 20 years and he is [ romano prodi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romano_prodi ) , but sadly his last government failed because berlusconi bribed senators to let it fail . 
  i do n't know what is the procedure , but the only time i saw a pilot go to the bathroom a steward waited standing at the cockpit door ( left open ) facing the passengers, 
  please do n't downvote this comment if you do n't agree , downvote a comment only if it is retarded , spam or does n't add anything to the discussion, 
  italy , if only he owned half the italian media, 
  you have to consider the fact that berlusconi had ( and in part still has ) basically the monopoly of the media . 
  continued bombardment by tv and newspapers/tabloids over 20 years created those 20 people . 
  just build a miniature hydroelectric power plant in every house, 
  was n't he asked to return with an appropriate username ? 
  me too , and i also wonder how women can even think voting for him . 
  i mean , i ca n't justify men voting for him , but he 's a known narcissistic pervert with a taste for young girls who never passes the opportunity to direct sexual remarks to women in public speeches . 
  it ca n't . 
  i 'm talking about an early dissolve , not the one at the end of the 5 year term , obviously . 
  in italy only the president of italy ( giorgio napolitano ) can dissolve the parliament , not even the parliament itself can . 
  oh please , that was a joke ... 
  the nothern and southern part of italy were so different at the time that the idea of an united italy was only a good idea in theory , but in practice this was later seen as an act of imperialism by the savoy . 
  kicking out the bourbon was a good idea , but the democracy came a century later , meanwhile landlords , masons and bandits ruled the south , starting what was later called mafia . 
  nonetheless , garibaldi was a great general and his actions against the papal state were very important for the later annexation of those territories . 
  he just was n't a great politician , he failed to foresee the consequences of his actions . 
  luckily italy had a skilled and enlighted politician : cavour, 
  what ? 
  i 'm neither a lega nord voter nor a communist . 
  please explain why you think he is a hero and please avoid attacking me with your prejudice . 
  that 's debatable . 
  he made possible the unification of italy , which probably was n't the best thing to do at the time . 
  right now i ca n't decide which is the italian epic hero , but there 's the probability that tomorrow we will have one : the supreme court of cassation, 
  first the train going to santiago , then the coach from petrelcina . 
  i guess that people should avoid going by plane to lourdes . 
  by the way , i always thought that those concrete shoulders would withstand the impact of a car or a truck . 
  now i 'm scared of losing grip or fall asleep ok a bridge ... 
  those who saw this video are those who did n't even think about voting berlusconi . 
  usually , the people whose only source of information is the tv are those who vote for him . 
  well , not today , as we have to wait the third degree for if to be effective . 
  and it could take 2-3 years . 
  i 'll trade your boring politicians for our entertaining ones, 
  brilliant !, 
  sell those houses ... to other italians !, 
   how do you explain grillo then ? 
  he does n't appear on tv , yet he won a considerable portion of the votes . 
  i was n't talking about grillo , i was talking about berlusconi . 
  how was n't it clear ? 
   hinting that only people with low iq would vote for berlusconi demonstrates a lack of understanding of a complex phenomenon , and it 's a dangerous understatement of berlusconi 's capability to attract votes i never wrote that only people with low iq would vote for berlusconi , where did you read that ? 
  so i do n't understand what are you trying to say . 
  people had an alternative to the left ( they had plenty , actually ) . 
  still they voted berlusconi . 
  what differentiated him from lega nord ? 
  they had their scandals , sure , but nothing compared to berlusconi 's . 
  also , monti 's ideas are centre-right , still he only got 10 % . 
  and let me say that monti to me seems closer to the idea of european centre-right than berlusconi . 
  the media is the key , he owns 3 of the 7 most viewed tv channels ( with 3 being state-owned and controlled by the government , so in fact when he was in charge he controlled 6 out of 7 tv channels ) . 
  he also owns or controls [ newspapers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/il_giornale ) , [ magazines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mondadori#magazines ) , [ a football team ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ac_milan ) , [ banks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mediolanum_ ( company \\ ) ) , the [ biggest publishing company ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mondadori ) in italy , and much more . 
  people that are the most illiterate and whose only source of information is the tv are being brainwashed by his media , so there are people that actually believe that he is innocent and oppressed by the state attorneys and the whole judiciary system . 
  there is also a ( relatively ) small chunk of voters that benefit from his laws ( big tax evaders , businessmen , etc ) . 
  just remember that half of the population , in every nation , is below the median of the iq .
