  what if the boots were shaped like italy ? 
  that 's malta, 
  you just anschluss 'd two countries without someone noticing it , that 's a very good record, 
  you could sell the chicken at a much better price then , or employ the chicken in the porn industry, 
  you could buy the whole friuli for $ 35bn ( its gdp ),

  :3 ^ youwo n'thavetriestebackthough, 
  we had a referendum to become popular too, 
  same result in italy . 
  maybe we should actually let them join ? 
   italy - a boot because 24 millions years ago we had a referendum to become a boot , the alternatives were a moccasin , a ballet flat and a crocs , go figure , the choice was pretty obvious , i could remember the day like it was yesterday / s  netherlands - so rich self-esteem , i love it, 
  [ milan metro area ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uomayvf.jpg ) ( roughly 2000 people/km \u00b2 ) looks crowded until you realizes how crowded [ naples metro area ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rxuwfox.jpg ) ( 2700 people/km \u00b2 ) is ... 
  they are [ dialects ] ( http://bostoniano.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mappa-dialetti.png ) , though . 
  if anything this map lacks of occitan and sardinian language , that are not dialects . 
  northern italian dialects ( gallo-italics ) are part of the western romance languages , while the southern ones are part of the southern romance languages ... 
  they are in the same romance language group but they are from different families, 
  do flemish language and dutch one come from different language families ? 
  the sad thing is that calabria is even above the southern italian average by a long shot when it comes to tax fraud , workforce with undeclared jobs and so on ... 
  the difference between , say , a venetian and a sicilian is much larger than the one between a dutch and a flemish, 
  if you have an undeclared job ( and not looking for a job then ) you 're an * inactive * to the stats , not an * unemployed * sicily and calabria for example have an 43 % employment rate , but many `` inactive '' people actually work , informally, 
  i 'm not claiming that they 're different people - italian ethnicity includes a lot of people and cultures ( venetians , tuscans , neapolitans , sicilians ... , so does the german one as well ) so it would be fairer ( imho ) to identify them with a single group of people they share culture and a common dialect with, 
  swiss italians are lombards, 
  how is it possible to find if some illegals are working in a legal business , if not through inspections ? 
  how can you avoid an employer to hire illegals ? 
  and if the business is undeclared itself ? 
  so are we going to invade lybia to secure its ports ? 
  what if there are actual refugees in the boats ? 
  smes are holding up the economy in italy as a whole automotive industry has declined a lot in italy . 
  it went well until there was n't globalization and pratically every italian had a fiat . 
  in the last two decade it has lived an huge crisis . 
  marchionne actually did some improvements , increasing quality of the cars , by buying chrysler and founding fca ( he put this new society 's hq in amsterdam though , he ca n't stand italian taxation , eheh ) . 
  but pratically a lot of workers in italy have been fired , and despite [ production ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_motor_vehicle_production ) ( we just overtook you last year lol , anyway i found out that slovakia is the first country by per capita production ) is now rising , it 's still a lot down from , say , the 90s, 
  you 're welcome . 
  the industrialization ( it started in the lat xix century , boomed in the early xx century ) happened in the places which had the infrastructures to do it : i.e. 
  piedmont and liguria , and parts of lombardy . 
  such regions were the core of our economic boom in the 60s , and indeed got in a few years millions over millions of workers from southern italy , some neighborhoods in turin were built just to house them : turin , from the 0,7 m inhabitants in 1951 , peaked almost 1,2 m in 1971 . 
  fiat mirafiori , the oldest still active factory in europe , their main employer , counted nearly 60000 workers in 1970 ( now it 's just 5400 ... everything got outsourced to poland , serbia and turkey ) . 
  since the 80s and mostly in 90s , the deindustrialization phase in the north-west started : the big industries ( producing steel , cars , clothes ... ) , core of the nw industrial production closed or outsourced ( somewhat similar to what happened to the uk or the us ) to romania or china , to name a few ( i once read that in romania there are almost 900k jobs brought by italian industries which outsourced ) , and the main industries pretty disappeared , but meanwhile the centre and above all the north-east was living an industrial boom , not thanks to the big industries or the conglomerates ( except fiat , ferrero and few others , italy has n't any ) but the small , family-led factories , nearly all of them with less than 15 workers , which have been able to increase their exports and mantain an high productivity and competitiveness ; such factories opened in the nw as well to avoid a complete deindustrialization . 
  if today we 're still the country with 2nd largest manufacturing output in europe , that 's not due to some large conglomerates , but to 400k small ( and medium ) manufacturing factories - thing somewhat similar to the german * mittelstands * , with the difference that germany has a lot of conglomerates too ) . 
  edit : spelling, 
  rome was a cultural center during the middle age but it was ' t that rich , for sure the states in northern italy were far richer ( milan , turin , venice , genoa , florence ... ) . 
  the first part of the country getting industrialized were turin , genoa and some communes near milan ( desio , sesto san giovanni ... ) together with naples ; contrary to what one could think , naples was actually fairly industrialized in the xix century ( [ industrialization index ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/italy_industry_1871.svg/2000px-italy_industry_1871.svg.png ) in the italian provinces in 1871 , where you can notice the former * industrial triangle * turin-milan-genoa , while nowadays the industries and manufacturing pretty shifted in the north-east : veneto and emilia romagna , while lombardy remains the first industrial region ), 
  before ... 80 years ago ? 
  spot on , there would n't be the fog otherwise ^ / s, 
  unlike rome , naples has actually improved in the recent years, 
  the real ones are much bigger . 
  rome is at 4,5 m , milan at roughly 7m . 
  for example , your list puts naples metro area at 3,1 m , that 's less than naples ' province when you should add part of caserta and salerno 's provinces ... 
  well milan is smaller than rome ( even tho its metropolitan area is bigger ), 
  lol thank you , that 's what i 've seen once and was looking for just a couple of days ago . 
  ca n't speak for the other countries but in italy the trouble is the opposite . 
  exports are going well helped by the weak euro . 
  economy is stagnating because of the domestic market . 
  look at the [ difference ] ( http://www.termometropolitico.it/media/2014/12/fatturato-interno-esterno.png ) between 2008 and 2013 of the facturate of the manufacturing , the first one is the internal market and the second one are the exports exports in some provinces with active industrial districts grew by two digit in 2015 , but the internal market is , often , still in negative . 
  which employ just the chinese and barely pay taxes ? 
  would n't have existed ? 
  textile industry in prato was born 150 years ago , not 15, 
  quite sad that italy would be 49th now but would have been 28th in 2009 . 
  the us recovered very fast from 2008 crisis . 
  exactly , in prato, 
  you did n't understand . 
  it 's not about working harder , they are being exploited , period . 
  two totally different things . 
  italians have to pay taxes and do n't have tens of people available for working all the day just for food . 
  have you idea about how the chinese work ? 
  they barely sleep and work 12-15 hours a day without respecting any sanitary standards and work rules . 
  when not working they live in garages with 5-6 coworkers . 
  for almost every chinese you see in the roads with a bmw there are tens of chinese being exploited by him . 
  not if they do n't pay taxes and exploit their compatriots by making them work 12 hours a day . 
  no , they do n't pay taxes . 
  they work by night when the job inspectors ca n't go into their factories to control them . 
  sanitary standards are not respected . 
  if they get fined , they change region and noone will know anything about them . 
  lately they 've been making part-time contracts for their workers to make them look like they are working legally , then the workers have to work 12 hours a day . 
  prato ( one of the capitals of the textile industry in italy , in xix century it was called * the manchester of tuscany * ) , near florence , has `` just '' 200k people but the biggest chinese community in europe after london and paris . 
  [ these ] ( http://www.connessioniprecarie.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/sette-cinesi-morti-nel-prato-di-casa.jpg ) are the signals of its industrial area . 
  and italian entrepreneurs are having hard times competing with people getting paid just the amount they need for food . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.video.mediaset.it/video/striscialanotizia/servizio/vivere-in-autorimessa_575164.html ) ( sorry , it 's just in italian language ) you can see how these people have to live ... source : my aunt is a job inspector . 
  except berlusconi / s, 
  if the dam had failed there would n't have been `` just '' 2000 deaths ... 
  no , he is close to * manganello * ( ie . 
  baton ) , more the - * iello * , suffix that many surnames in naples area have, 
  what does somalia have to do with all this ? 
  so do you dump them somewhere in the country ? 
  they usually bring two boats . 
  with the second one they get out . 
  once you have intercepted it ? 
  how ? 
  you have to make them go to x country with a plane . 
  and that country must agree with it .
