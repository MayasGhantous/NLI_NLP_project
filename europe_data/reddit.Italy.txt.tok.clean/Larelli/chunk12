  you 're right except here :  net wealth is higher the average is , but [ the median ] ( https://medianism.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/median-adult-wealth1.png ) is not . 
  * statistics-addicted flies away *, 
  nah , they 're our biggest friend . 
  how could you not love it ? 
  the evil french are !, 
  same to you , german products have high quality , i 'm not denying that at all . 
  germany and italy are the unique european countries who produce almost everything inside the country and an house could be filled only with national products ( household electrical appliances , doors , beds and furnitures , kitchens . . ) and not import anything ( except gas , oil , computers and electronical products and few other things , at least for us ) , so i understand your point , i understand that the germans want to buy their own products , yet you guys should import more products from france/italy/spain for example , it 'd reduce your trade surplus , but noone can be forced . 
  a lot of factories near vicenza , verona and brescia ( thanks to the proximity to the a22 brenner motorway ) produce machines they export to the big german companies like vw and bmw and others , so the textile and clothing field is not the only one we can export . 
  you can always keep buying high quality shoes ( i live in a footwear industrial district :d ), 
  that 's what i was stating . 
  mount blanc is shared by both the nations , but the highest peak is in italy . 
  the french peak is 20 mt lower . 
  a bit of everything . 
  we did it even 8 years ago ^ for3months, 
  once again , france . 
  you can use the term `` pigs '' towards a person you know , at most : italy is growing , so are spain and portugal . 
  shhhhhhhhh, 
  france , imho . 
  yes , you can be with us !, 
  france . 
  they 're our biggest rival in every fields but secretely we like them . 
  do n't tell that to anyone !, 
  when kingdom of sardinia was french ally , at most ? 
  like the hundreds and hundreds of trillions itl for the * cassa del mezzogiorno * ? 
  a big part of the southern italy 's problems is up to local politicians and the presence of a massive extortion to small businesses , even though the central government has a big share of the responsability as well , alright . 
  indeed . 
  if our peak melts down france will get the highest peak : <, 
  the highest peak of mount blanc is in italy . 
  most of northern italy does n't have at all a mediterreanean climate, 
  i know and you 're right here , but you ca n't have a healthy population without an efficient healthcare . 
  yes , there are . 
  they born for indepedence with slogans such as '' [ thief rome ] ( https://marcovallari.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/gallina20padana20elett08.jpg ) '' , they tried to federalize italy with berlusconi , partly failing , but now that party does n't stand for indepedence anymore , as salvini ( their current secretary ) turned the party into an italian fn . 
  btw , [ here ] ( http://www.lozzodicadore.eu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/rfr-per-regione.png ) there are the fiscal residues towards italy for each region . 
  if according to vertikal germany ca n't stay in the same union with the 2nd manufacture in europe , the third net countributor to the eu budget and the country that host the wealthiest area in europe , italy should n't exist at all ? 
  blonde = white hair there in scandinavia ? 
  yes italy has very good food but it 's not the only important thing . 
  i 'd like to see someone talking about italy about the excellences we have in the fields i wrote rather than always the same things about food and so on . 
  so what . 
  difference between gdp per capita of germany and italy is ** much ** lower than the difference between lombardy ( higher than nl ) and campania ( as low as latvia ) . 
  then italy as well should n't exist as fiscal union ? 
  but they are quite complementary . 
  this if fully blond for me . 
  is [ this ] ( http://cf.ltkcdn.net/hair/images/slide/145439-500x618r1-light-pale-blonde.jpg ) the * blonde standard * in sweden ? 
  well entering the public sector is not a good solution for the state . 
  it creates less productivity and more expenses . 
  that 's what used to be in southern italy until 10 years ago : a lot of people were allowed into the pa to reduce unemployment , ending up with shameful waste of money and people doing nothing the whole day . 
  seems like spain , southern italy and greece [ share the same problem ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pccxw6eiufu/uo1ys_byn5i/aaaaaaaad_m/r75mhom_sja/s1600/funcionarios+espa%c3%b1a+y+europa.gif ) : too many public employers . 
  yeah , i 'm aware of that . 
  it started with the fall of the wall there used to be until 2004 . now slovenia made great strides and is ready to fully be economically integrated with friuli , and , in this specific case , gorizia with nova gorica . 
  hopefully in some years the project will be realized , for the benefits of both the cities . 
  * sees , sorry for my typo  i know noone having bad feelings towards germans or slovenian minority . 
  trieste independentists pretty do n't exist and they have very little influence even in trieste province itself . 
  there is who wants trieste to be an independent city-state like monaco , others who aim to whole friuli to be independent , others who would like whole * padania * ( northern italy + part of central italy ) to be independent , the former project of the northern league . 
  all independentist aims are for ** economic ** benefits , nearly all people nowadays do n't care at all about history . 
  slovenes are quite bad seen by far right party such as * casapound * which would like to remove slovenian language from road signs , documents and so on , but except these people everyone sees positively the slovenian minority ( and the german , or the french in aosta valley ) and the italian republic does n't discriminate at all such minorities : the provinces with german/slovenian/french minority have road signs , official acts ... in that language , which is taught is the schools as well . 
   i bet it 's a challenge to find someone that believes there 's 5 % unemployment rate in either italy , greece or bulgaria . 
  there is , in some northern italian provinces , such as bolzano , verona , prato or reggio emilia . 
  in trentino alto adige there is a germam minority which is the majority in the northern part of the region , bolzano province , or alto adige / south tyrol . 
  in friuli venezia giulia there is a slovenian minority but is very tiny compared to the german one in south tyrol , it 's spoken by about 50k people near trieste and gorizia . 
  these regions are both * special * one and are allowed to keep their money in their region : so they could put tax reliefs for their people and factories and avoid the negative trend . 
   is there any difference between local italian opinion and a more southern/western one ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  if they are discriminated ? 
  no , noone sees such minorities badly , except some nationalist parties . 
  joining the public sector if unemployed ? 
  do n't this increases the spanish deficit ? 
  every young person can join the army ? 
  debt relief when your debt is even lower than your gdp ? 
  i know that your deficit is a bit high , but spanish debt even if fast growing is not that scarying . 
  and who 's going to pay for this basic income if few people want to work ? 
  it 's a possible thing only in small countries with raw resources , like norway for example . 
  not in a big country with lack of raw materials . 
  and whatever ... the usual 4 bs . 
  why do n't you talk instead of healthcare , manufacturing industries , research , innovation ... no the important thing is that we do desserts better than everyone else . . 
   to build a second tunnel while the gotthard tunnel is repaired . 
  if this is rejected by the population you could not drive through the alps in that region for several years ( you 'd have to put your car on trains ) . 
  for those who do n't know the region , this would mean that the canton of ticino ( italian speaking region ) would be isolated from the rest of switzerland for years . 
  some do n't consider that isolation , but i do , so i 'll vote yes . 
  this means that a ticinese [ would have to take ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vj7gcne.jpg ) a13 and then a3 or a9 motorway to go to zurich or bern ? 
  in italy a demochristian party had `` the extreme centre '' as motto, 
  common in italy as well . 
  that 's great !, 
  and could n't you tell me it before ? 
  :p well imho not that much . 
  let 's say that we have one percentuage of the population self-hating and another which is the opposite of that . 
  but `` italians '' as common people do n't exist , and i know you have a lot of internal differences as well . 
  well , i trust you , feel bad for that . 
  in 80s fiat was full of strikes and employers sabotaging cars . 
  do you live 120 years ? 
  most of polls give `` yes '' as the favourite vote . 
  sure . 
   you and your narrow autostradas narrow ? 
  at most trafficked , seen our high population density . 
  almost all motorways in italy are 3 lanes + the emergency one . 
  they cost a lot , but the quality of them ( except a3 motorway ) is undeniable . 
   worst politicians on earth and which politicians ? 
  but have you lived in italy ? 
  there are two kind of bad politicians . 
  the fool , who is everywhere , and the corrupt , who is in some areas of our south . 
  i fully trust my local politicians .
