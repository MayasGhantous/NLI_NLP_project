  here 's the deal of the century : corsica , provence-alps and rhone-alps for whole southern italy , k ? 
  eheh , you would like it !, 
  piedmont for corsica more savoy and provence . 
  we ca n't lose so easily a region with a positive fiscal residue , sry !, 
  equivalent of = / = accounted for, 
   greeks would save like germans , and germans would spend like greeks do you mean greek/german ** government ** or greek/german ** people ** ? 
  these are concepts totally differents, 
  nowadays sicilian cosa nostra and calabrian ndragheta are barely killing people , i do n't live in those areas but i 've never heard an homicide commited by them since months . 
  now i bet the blue italian region would be campania ( the region naples is in ) . 
  a couple of days ago 3 guys were killed in less than 24hrs , the average in the last weeks is 2-3 camorra homicides a week , because there is a war between local gangs . 
  what trades ? 
  cultural or economic ones ? 
  but what regional security ? 
  what does it mean ? 
  russia is n't going to invade any eu country . 
   we 're in the eu , and i 'd like us to start solving shit together . 
  duck , let 's say that to greece , with all the debt question and the migrants ' problems we have let them to deal with alone . 
  or even to italy , when a lot of eastern european countries refused to take the refugee quota . 
  double standards , maybe ? 
  italian-russian trade relationships worth more than the gdp of many ee countries . 
  if we have to stop our trades with russia our economy as well our industries will lose an important partner and will be damaged , and this means problems for whole eu . 
  what about north stream confirmed and south stream which risked to be deleted ? 
  luckily moscow may finally start the labours for it . 
  to be fair , you ca n't ruin the exports of a nation towards an its great economic partner . 
   german in europe yes , in the rest of the world ? 
  not realy . 
  italian ? 
  in italy maybe . 
  spanish and french is far more usefull , as are languages like russian , mandarin and english . 
  german in europe ? 
  not as french or english for sure . 
   as for european integration : i dont like the idea of undermining europes identities in an effort to make it more economically viable . 
  culture must not be saccrificed on the altar of profit . 
  keeping the culture is very important for sure , but the world is globalized . 
  each country has got the right to its culture , but the economic benefits of schengen and more integration are undeniable . 
  will benefit ? 
  are you serious ? 
  :| we need a very weak euro for the exports . 
  last year , thanks to a relatively weak euro italian exports made +5 %, 
  our public debt is going to be reduced in the next years . 
  our economy has still a very long way to return to pre-crisis level , but the risk of default is almost gone , we went close to it in 2011 though . 
  you ca n't compare italy before the fall of berlin 's wall to any other western european nation , because italy has been ruled for about 50 years ( 1948-1994 ) by the same parties , more or less , because we had the strongest communist party in the western world and the other parties made an agreement between themselves ( the so-called * pentapartito * ) to avoid a communist victory . 
  the coalition was formed by christian democracy , socialist party , socialist democratic party , republican party and liberal party , and they often quarelled between themselves to get one more ministery for their own party and so on . . so the pm was often a puppet whose government would n't have lasted more than 1 years , but the very rulers of italy were the secretaries of those 5 parties . 
  after that , italy ( during 90s , when berlusconi entered politics ) had a fair low , the so-called * mattarellum * , which theorically would have granted stable government ( for example berlusconi governed since 2001 to the end of the mandate , in 2006 ) , but the left was n't singleman-centered ( unlike the berlusconi 's right ) , so the left coalition hosted parties from christian democrats to former communists , and so them made fall the left gov in 1997 , replaced then with a more leftist gov led by a former communist . 
  afterwards in 2005 berlusconi approved the dumbest electoral law ever ( the * porcellum * ) that led italy to the recent years ' instability . 
  now the new electoral law renzi made ( the * italicum * , despite i do n't like it a lot ) is going to ensure italy stable goverment for 5 years . 
  you ca n't judge things without knowing the historic background behind them , even though i can understand it may be hard to get , abroad . 
  statically italy is a big 4 and every statistics confirm that , then renzi 's requests are fair . 
  we ca n't always talk about the past . 
   says who ? 
  you dont know that . 
  for what its worth , it would also mean better connections to a country with their own language , it would mean that they would be part of a country that is more likley to share their political motives . 
  would you create an exception for them ? 
  what if burgenland ( with croat/hungarian minority ) asks for automony as well ? 
   for students , this would be especaily good , lots of south tyroleans already study in innsbruck or some even in graz and vienna , to them , that would make things much easier . 
  erasmum was introduced a bit of years ago , mate ... what would the current difficult for them be ? 
   also it would remove the need to learn italian in school , making way for more education in english or other languages that are actually relevant . 
  what about the italian minority ( 25 % of southern tyroleans , the majority near bolzano/bozen ) ? 
  you should give rights to them , keeping the road signs in italian , documents in italian , allow them to do italian at school ... also , are you saying italian and german are n't rilevant at all ? 
   furthermore it would mean beeing part of the austrian job market they can go to work in austria even now . 
  northen italian gross wages are the same as austrian ones , they would enjoy a lower taxation for sure , yet they already spend their tax revenue in their region , then , less money for the provincial government . 
   according to a fascist . 
  its called s\u00fcdtirol , nobody that lives there calls it anything else . 
  south tyrol is also alto adige . 
  the first term is * cultural * one , the second is just * geographic * : the adige river borns there , so in south tyrol there is the first course of it . 
   rising youth unemployment and an extreme difference in wealth distribution from north to south , austrias distribution from west to east is far less extreme . 
  actually youth unemployment is falling , with the total unemployment . 
  in 2013 they were at 13 % and 44 % , now we 're at 11 % and 37 % ( this does n't mean is a good percentuage , the road to be back at pre-crisis level is still long ) . 
  i know that austria or any european countries ( above all france for example ) have n't an internal gap like the italian one . 
  but what to do ? 
  it 's mostly southern italy 's fault . 
  since 50s to 90s , we spent tens and tens of trillions of liras ( the equivalent of hundreds and hundreds of billions of current euros ) to try to industrialize southern italy . 
  the project mostly failed . 
  another big percentuage of the industries which really opened and survived ( firstly multinationals , which opened there thank to tax reliefs ) closed or went away in the last years . 
   lombardy is basically hogging the entire wealth of the country northern italy as a whole is . 
  another rich regions and net contributors to the italian budget are emilia romagna , veneto , piedmont , tuscany ... lombardy is the first but not the only one . 
   which is why its probably a good idea for south tyrol to ditch southern italy . 
  south tyrol does n't get dragged down by southern italy , except in the statistics which talk about italy as a whole . 
  the other northern regions which are n't special like south tyrol are . 
  lombardy alone has a surplus/positive fiscal residue towards italy of 49 billions eur/year ( 17 % of its gdp ) , emilia romagna and veneto have both a positive one of 21 billions ( 12-13 % of their gdp ) , and so on . 
  the fiscal residue of trentino alto adige towards italy is 2 % of their tax revenue . 
   this isnt an argument in your favor . 
  basically what you are showing is that s\u00fcdtirol is better off than the rest of italy and that they certainly dont have italy to thank for that . 
  they have , because if they have got such a low unemployment rate and they almost did n't feel the crisis at all , it 's because of the fiscal benefits italian republic allow them . 
  they have tax reliefs for factories ( unlike lombardy , veneto and so on ) , for mothers ( thing which allowed them to have the highest fertility rate in italy ) ... have a look [ here ] ( http://images2.corriereobjects.it/methode_image/2016/02/01/economia/foto%20economia%20-%20trattate/grafico-0030-kdbb-u43150396728040ych-593x443@corriere-web-sezioni.jpg?v=20160131204624 ) , that 's what every region spend yearly for each inhabitant ( unluckily it 's only in italian language ) . 
  bolzano and trento 's autonomous provinces are on the top , lombardy , emilia romagna and veneto on the bottom . 
  south tyrolean politicians are for sure clean and use that money wisely , unlike the politicians in southern autonomous regions , yet they 're allowed to spend 4 times the money lombardy can spend for its citizens , per capita . 
  this brings lombardy and so on to sometimes lack the money for road manteniance , it has to do cuts to the healthcare ... southern italy is a weight for the big northern regions rather than for south tyrol  economically the us did pretty well . 
  but thats besides the point . 
  doesnt justify continuing this nonsense . 
  alright , but us had n't its industrial fabric , infrastructures and so on touched by the war , unlike in europe . 
   what is your reason to want south tyrol to be part of italy . 
  you personally . 
  what is your reason , i cant wait to find out . 
  i could argue that south tyrol was included in italic province during romans ' times , or that south tyrol is part of italian geographic region , being under the alps , or other reasons used by fascists , but i 'm not a nationalist so i wo n't be losing my time . 
  south tyrol is always been with hre ( northern italy as well ) , and later with austria and austro-hungaric empire , which gave them a tyrolease culture and the germanic language . 
  but now , in 2016 , talking about borders in the eu is useless : by your logic we should redraw half of european borders , you 'd get south tyrol , we 'd get ticino , savoy and eastern provence ( where live more than 3-4 millions people with italian heritage , and the french did n't recognize them or protect the italin minority , but imposed them to speak french , so now almost everyone of them does n't speak italian ) , istria ... do you think that would be possible ? 
  eu nowadays quite sucks . 
  it 's disorganized and messy , i know . 
  yet the ideas of european integration must not die due to the eu of these years or in name of an outdated nationalism .
