  once you 're in , you must respect decisions , otherwise , you can get out . 
  imho it 's unfair to remain in while taking money and benefits . 
  eu makes decisions through the countries , alright . 
  and decisions taken by the majority of the members have to be respected . 
  poland is not special . 
  being a net recipient is aggravating the fact poland is doing what the duck its gov wants to do . 
  it would be a pity even if the uk itself ( net contributor ) refuse common decisions , but at least they can do it , being an * opt-out * member ( that 's another bs , giving 3 countries the oppurtinity to refuse decisions for no reason ) . 
  then , why are the western countries accepting eu decisions ? 
  one should suppose they 're stupids ? 
  then every gov is free to do what he wants to do despite being member of the eu ? 
  sure , let 's leave greece alone dealing with the migrants , let 's close the borders once again ( even for poles migrants ) , let 's block the trades ... hail anarchy . 
  do n't try to decontextualize my words . 
  i 'm not saying poland has to be germany 's sissy , i 'm saying that poland is a member as everyone else that must accept the decisions taken by the eu , not just by few countries of course . 
  if polish gov thinks eu sucks , okay , feel free to start refusing eu money . 
  of course . 
  and what eu commision or the majority of the members decide as well . 
  germany or any country did n't order to poland what to do . 
  this does n't change that poland is a eu member . 
  if eu commision ( not a couple of countries of course ) decides a thing , it 's fair that all the members , * including * poland ( but it 's valid for every countries ) * have to * respect that . 
  especially when the eu helped a lot your country ( i 'm referring to the eastern ones ) to get out from the mess russia left them in 90s . 
  what i say : you just ca n't accept the money or only the benefits . 
  if you wanted to enter the eu , you had to know you would have got to do things you do n't like to do . 
  i did n't know poland ( or hungary and a lot of other countries as well ) have been threaten to join the union . 
  is pis going to reject those 12 billions ~ ~ germany , france , italy , uk and netherlands ~ ~ the eu gift you every year ? 
  money are ok but following common decisions is not ? 
  in england it 's not [ that bad ] ( http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2004/10/no2_levels_over_europe_-_zoom_for_detail/10316365-2-eng-gb/no2_levels_over_europe_-_zoom_for_detail_large.jpg ) unlike in northern italy ... in the red part in italy there 's a conurbation of 25 million people , and over half of the italian gdp is produced there . 
  imho england is quite good because it has no industries anymore , northern italy is instead the most industrialized area in europe , and there are countless industries ( even a lot of steel factories , the worst ones when it comes to pollution ), 
  monte paschi di siena , our most troubled bank , have been bailed out by the gov when berlusconi was in power ( more or less in 2010 if i 'm not wrong ) . 
  now , after some quiet years , banks started freaking ( especially it ) because of new eu rules . 
  well the link i posted shows the last loans , the total billions greece owes to germany are 60 , and about 40 both to france and italy . 
  there 's a similar situation in italy , those money are already considered as lost money . 
  if greece defaults ( even tho i do n't think they will - tsipras accepted what eu ordered ) they will on the whole europe , not just germany . 
  exactly . 
  and then even dare to tell other eu countries what to do and demanding more sovereignty when someone tells poland to follow eu decisions . 
  new eu rules about the banks became law on 1st january 2016 , banks ' question in italy started in november more or less , now renzi is still thinking what to do . 
   italy needs to start manning up and saying `` no '' to the eu sometimes . 
  about that , i fully agree with you . 
  and one could hope if what you said regarded only the banks ' question ... 
   i honestly do n't see why we are specially singled out . 
  because france and italy have strong trades and imports/exports with other european countries , greece has n't , welcome in double standards ' world . 
  support towards the gay rights has increased a lot recently , that 's a fact . 
  it is , for low italian standards xd, 
  500k people in alto adige / s\u00fcdtirol ( 39k ) vs 10kk in lombardy ( 35k ) or 5kk in veneto ( 33k ) . 
  not exactly the same thing . 
  i know that the new england 's states and others too had already approved it some years ago , i was joking , 
  until some years ago majority was againt same sex marriage . 
  yet we must say that italian people made a lot of progress in the past years , and now the majority supports even same sex marriage and gay adoption for sure . 
  state has n't approved gay rights yet = / = people are homophobe, 
  maybe he wants to because of the fast internet :d * download speed here : 5 mbit *, 
  actually even italians themselves come from entirely different traditions . 
  a lombard is more similar to a swiss than to an apulian . 
  a calabrian is more similar to a greek than to a venetian , for example . 
  that 's why the us have approved it all over the country just the last year , to not be that backward :p, 
  i was being sarcastic . 
  italy was never bailed-out and 75 % of the debt is held by italian companies , spain and portugal are very fast growing economies , spain 's debt itself is lower than its gdp . 
  letting alone greece , one should tell me what 's the unsustainable situation ; those countries are in a * though * situation , yet is far from * unsustainable * . 
  pig who ? 
  what 's the unsustainable situation ? 
   no young ** christians ** maybe no young at all ? 
  if they were christians , they 'd believe in god . 
  an unregulated immigration policy brings to such results : the victory of the fear and the populism . 
  same in france or italy . 
  hopefully eu will cut talking and take effective actions . 
  thanks , rome . 
  renzi did well . 
  no money from any italian taxpayer will go to a parasite country and isis-friendly . 
  are you from southern italy ? 
  if you substitute flanders with padania and belgium with italy you 've got what northern league has been saying for decades :d before salvini realized the southern italians can vote and started turning the party into an italian fn . 
  nice point . 
  in scandinavian countries , where corruption is the lowest in the world , the state and the welfare are very strong . 
  in corrupt countries the state tend to `` leave alone '' people , being the family the only welfare . 
  i do n't think czech republic is n't in good shape . 
  the important is to not to make debt when you 're in deficit and not to make deficit while you 're getting in debt . 
  during both first and second italian economical boom in 60s and 80s , we had something like -9 % deficit , the important thing is try to get in debt as little as possible . 
  our debt is luckily held at 75 % by national companies , but when you have a nation rather poor with an high foreign debt , you have got greece , which has been blackmailed by its creditors . 
  however when you have got a situation like the italian one you just ca n't default , or the first ones to be hit are your own people and companies who hold the debt . 
  looks like those yachts are suspended in mid-air :p very beatiful !, 
  you 're quite right . 
  poorest the place , highest the corruption . 
  highest the corruption , poorest the place . 
  despite it ca n't be taken as an * physical law * , it 's often true , as statistics say . 
  the least corrupted nations in the world ( denmark and finland ) are not the richest countries in the world , but for sure they are n't poor at all . 
  italy ranks badly on corruption perception ( yet a thing to take with a pinch of sailt , being a ** perception ** ) . 
  italy ranks instead quite good when it comes to people asked for a bribe , [ here ] ( https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/experiences-with-corruption-in-the-european-union-you-were-asked-or-expected-to-pay-a-bribe-for-services-personally-know-someone-who-has-taken-bribes_chartbuilder2.png?w=1024&amp;h=1389 ) we go . 
  in italy corruption concerns mostly the public works , not the small things like bribes and so on . 
  and often calabrian or neapolitan mafias are involved on public works , nearly always in southern italy . 
  having italy this kind of corruption ( mostly ) and being it focused ( mostly ) on a part of the country , i 'd say that this `` law '' is not valid for italy , for example , as we 're not poor . 
  yet at the bottom of the list you wo n't find rich countries . 
  i think that if a place is rich , the people inside the place deserved the richness by hardworking , and being rich they do n't need corruptions , and their culture refuses it . 
  imho history has a lot to do with that . 
  in the past southern italy was an only kingdom , but in the end nothing but countless latifundium lands assigned to a local master , and people were kept ignorant . 
  in contrast , northern italy hosted a lot of little states ( venice 's republic , duchy of milan , of parma , of modena , granduchy of tuscany , kingdom of piedmont , republic of genoa ... ) which were based on trade , with a strong entrepreneurial class . 
  so it is northern italy today . 
  we can not deny that during 1800s and first 1900s all italy was rather poor , including northern italy , except cities like turin and milan . 
  during 60s and afterwards in 80s in regions like mine , marche ( which in the past had always been quite poor being part of the church 's state , except during 1500s , when we had ancona maritime republic ) and others like veneto and friuli , northern italy lived a incredible economical boom due to the industries which brought it to be one of the richest part in europe ( it used to be the first until 15 years ago ) . 
  this thing did n't happen in southern italy . 
  people kept emigrating in northern italy , or , some of them , in germany or swizerland even when italy was growing up of something like 6 % / year . 
  southern italy had n't had a entrepreneurial class able to build a solid industry . 
  and local mafias stopped a lot of initiatives . 
  southern italian politicians were leaked with mafias and corrupt even 50 years ago , the northern ones were n't .
