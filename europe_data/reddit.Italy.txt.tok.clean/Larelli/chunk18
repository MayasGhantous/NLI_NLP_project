  this might have played an important part . 
  hope i di n't annoy you !, 
  they did n't say giving 100 eur to a policeman is not corruption , they said it ca n't be considered as such if commited by a drunk man , who does n't have full mental conditions . 
  would you convict an handicapped person for giving a policeman some money ? 
  the cop was honest , as 99 % of the cops in italy . 
  then you did n't understand the sentence . 
  they did n't say giving to a cop 100 eur is not corruption ; if i get out my home , drive to the nearest police station and do such thing i get arrested lol . 
  with a drunk man it 's another thing , because the drunk man is not in his own full mental conditions . 
  of course drunkness must be proven . 
  by stating that denmark is a richer country ( richer for what ? 
  gdp per capita , exports , industry , banks , wealth , household income , wages , median wealth per adult ? 
  what criterias are you using ? ), 
  you mean that a policeman would n't accept 100 eur because he 's already rich ? 
  look , if this sentence was issued then the policeman reported the corruption . 
  and even in italy is illegal accepting gifts worthing more than 150 eur . 
  corruption is everywhere in the world , of course the thing which matters is at what level . 
  we ca n't talk of corruption in italy taking the country as a whole . 
  @schrodingers , from which region are you from ? 
  islands like sicily and sardinia ? 
  corruption is n't widespread in tuscany , but is in these 2 islands . 
  italy had to be `` the next greece '' since 2009 ... when will it be ? 
  may i know ? 
  montepaschi di siena , our 3rd bank , made +43 % yesterday . 
  today +17 % . 
  it recovered how much it had lost in the past days . 
  unemployment is decreasing ; industry ( hearth of the italian economy ) is slowly increasing its output . 
  what is this article talking about ? 
  today mps ( our 3rd bank , the most hit recently ) made +43 % . 
  did n't expect that , but draghi 's words had their effect . 
  ur argument is invalid ; - ; http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/lightbox/published/231/images/thumb.jpg, 
  dialect , but for example a northern italian has completely another accent compared to a southern italian . 
  valle d'aosta, 
  and milan 's duomo random appears, 
  gothenburg apparently, 
  i was joking , i 'd say around 4-5 % is the healthiest rate . 
  yeah , because czech workforce is much cheaper . 
  i doubt german companies there have a lot of people employed in czechia with german wages . 
  but why would they go specifically there ? 
  because it 's close and cheaper i guess ? 
  czech republic has way lower wages , though . 
  if they get to keep their same wage maybe yes , considering czechia is much cheaper . 
  they should kick them and get 0 %, 
  of course , bratislava has a very high gdp per capita . 
  i just wanted to point out that its gdp ppp surpassed vienna 's , not the nominal one . 
  ppp inflates quite a bit the poorer countries . 
  actually full time jobs in greece are on par with q3 2012 , a * lot * less than in 2008 , but it 's something . 
  greece has one of the lowest share of people working part-time in europe too . 
   6th richest region in eu in terms of gdp per capita surpassing vienna and prague remember that 's gdp ppp though, 
  ah sorry , i misunderstood . 
  i though you meant the `` normal '' employment rate . 
  about cash-in-hand worker , that 's a [ report ] ( http://www3.istat.it/istat/audizioni/220710/allegato1.pdf ) by istat made in 2010 with 2001-2007 datas ( but always pretty reliable , just keep in mind that the number of cash-in-hand workers has a bit risen during the crisis , maybe it 's back at 2001-2002 levels ) . 
   at the same time , it kinda confirms that campania is the region with the lowest actual employment rate . 
  actually not , it 's calabria again . 
  it has 39,8 % employment rate while campania has 41,3 % , anyway both are percentuages to cry at if compared to the eu average of 65 % . 
   is there article coupled by the stat by the way ? 
  i would be interested in reading it about cash-in-hand workers or employment rate ? 
  if it 's the latter , i made a [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i9w960j.png ) about it with istat datas . 
  he 's from the south i guess ? 
  a bit better . 
  [ esteems ] ( http://noitaliaexplorer.istat.it/stories/2015/xml/accessibility/2/s16i09.png ) say that in calabria about 27 % of the workforce has undeclared jobs , the highest number in italy , that means that almost the half of the calabrians without a job may be working cash-in-hand . 
  but austria has an huge winter-season `` industry '' , so i thought the lowest peak was n't in january . 
  yeah , cash-in-hand jobs are ones of the main issues indeed , and that 's why i wrote * declared * job, 
  this is true . 
  that 's why i believe unemployment rate to be often misleading , especially in countries like italy where there are more inactive people than unemployed ones ; in calabria for example inactive people are even twice the unemployed ones , what 's the point in fully trusting unemployment rate if it interests just 1/3 of the people without a ( declared ) job ? 
  greece lost almost 30 % gdp in the meantime , though . 
  there is definitely a recovery although one could say it 's too slow compared to what has been lost . 
  i think that too , the fishing industry is more than a quarter of their gdp , add the aluminium smelting , the geothermal power stations and the tourism ( yearly tourists in iceland are 4 times the island 's population ) . 
  well , crisis hit us too ? 
  :p anyway it 's the rate for people under 25 years old , i would n't pay too much attention on it , in italy only about 1/4 of the under 25 people are part of the workforce : 15 % employed , 10 % unemployed , 75 % inactive ( students and neets ), 
  pratically it almost halved compared to 2011 . 
  if we look at the [ number of employed people ] ( http://image.prntscr.com/image/7b2150907092413ca6fd868a4d7abd70.png ) , austria has historically a very interesting and cyclical `` pyramid-like '' pattern i was n't aware about , with the employment peaking on every year 's july and reaching the lowest point on january , with pretty much every month doing better than the past year 's same month . 
  anyway , in 2016 the employment seemed to grow faster than the past years . 
  i do n't know if we 're the most diverse , but yes for sure among the first ones . 
  i would n't say that , slovenia has one of the highest share of added value from manufacturing in europe , as much as northern italy and not that far from southern germany ( although with a way lower gdp per capita ) . 
  source : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/unemployment_statistics pdf report : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7720354/3-03112016-ap-en.pdf/bf3d493b-9596-4ac9-b5ff-4e078523622a that 's ilo unemployment by eurostat . 
  they calculate it the same way for every country , so if according your national statistic institution it 's 0,01 % lower than according to eurostat , avoid commenting and bear in mind it has nothing to do with this method . 
  also , for a better monthly view we should look at employment rates change though , as unemployment rate often tells just `` half '' the truth . 
  in italy , for example , the unemployment rate has been raising in the recent months , but that 's due a big fall of the inactive people ( who are , by definition , outside the labour force ) who became in part employed , in part unemployed . 
  that 's somewhat healthy for the labour market , unlike an unemployment rise due to a fall of employed people , as it often happens . 
  in [ trading economics ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ ) you can see the monthly employment rate in various countries . 
  quite a lot . 
  internet 's biggest lie after * i am older than 18 *, 
  right , but if anything it 's the uk that heavily drags down the balance , almost everyone has a trade surplus with them . 
  imho , with ceta exporting countries will increase their surplus even more and importing ones will maybe increase their deficits . 
  maybe , because sterling is devaluating ( but so did the cad ) so the uk deficit might become smaller . 
  for belgium and malta , i guess their deficits are their ports ' fault . 
  iirc the african plate is moving up against the european one thus the earthquakes, 
  curse words , that 's a more adequate translation :d, 
  i 've seen the original one . 
  they were blasphemies , ofc, 
  bigger than this morning 's ? 
  that would be absolutely disastrous . 
  we ca n't make predictions about earthquakes , sadly . 
  more or less , almost 50 km away , but the cities hit in august had serious damages too . 
  apparently , luckily , this one made no deaths even though it was the strongest since 1980 's irpina earthquake that made 2914 deaths . 
  it has to be said that a lot of people had already left their houses and went to hotels in coastal cities and lots of houses in the area were restructured after another earthquake in 1997 . 
  how are italy 's poor growth performances correlated with some eastern european countries actually being leechers ? 
   poland ( and i expect other v4 countries ) is going to transform into a netto payer by 2020 . 
  only if ukraine joins and the uk actually leaves at most . 
  if the v4 countries become net contributors who 's going to remain a receiver ?
