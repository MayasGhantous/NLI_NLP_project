  there is n't that difference between north and south when it comes to gdp/capita change , piedmont fell by 15 % for example . 
  there 's the dramatical case of umbria in central italy , that has now almost $ 23,000 gdp per capita , do you know how much it was in 1995 ? 
  $ 25,000 ( source : svimez ) , and all the italian regions but south tyrol are behind 2000 's gdp per capita . 
  then there is abruzzo , which lost `` just '' 9 % but had it gdp/capita peak in 2001 instead of 2007 . 
  it has to be said too that in 2015 southern italy grew by 1 % compared to the national average of 0,8 % , with the little basilicata doing +5,5 % thanks to the boom a fiat car plant in the region made , abruzzo too grew by 2,5 % for the same reason , sicily did 1,5 % in part due to the agriculture , even though campania and apulia still show poor growth ( 0,2 % ) because of their declining industrial production . 
  confartigianato says our gdp per capita will return to pre-crisis level in 2027 , twenty years later , if we continue to follow the 2015-2016 growth rates . 
   too often everyone focuses on fancy stuff , but generally speaking , at least from what i observe , the best performers over time are those who are diligently plugging away at the economic fundamentals . 
  they may not have the highest growth rate in a given year , but the accumulated dividend of their discipline and hard work propels them beyond most of those who are tempted to boost their economy in the short term through gimmicks like asset bubbles of various kinds or credit-fuelled expansions which always end in tears . 
  exactly , just have a look at what germany did : they reformed themselves in the first 2000s when they were in crisis while spain and greece were booming , now germany managed to be the leading country in the eurozone and the one which showed more resilience to the global and euro crisis . 
   actually , that is the one big problem with our economy , we have massive private debt to our ears , even if our government debt is low and declining . 
  yeah that 's a common characteristic of the scandinavians ( including the netherlands ) and anglo-saxons countries . 
  in italy it 's the other way around , high public debt but [ low private debt ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/houshold-debt.jpg ) . 
  in general the italians do n't like having debt , and a part of the people living with parents are doing that to save as much money as possible to buy an house , for example that 's what my father did . 
  oxygen would like to share a word with you !, 
  [ us all while beating malta ] ( http://gesuiti.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/inquisizione.jpg ), 
  lol but according to the stats , the traitor is malta :p, 
  now i got that , pratically they 're using people without a job , which is not nearly the same as people looking for a job because the first are inactive people , not counted as unemployment . 
  they are both useful , the unemployement rate for the average person and the employment one for the macro-economics shape of a country . 
   the employment rate includes people in school , retired people , stay at home parents , and disabled people . 
  yes but it 's the same for every country , employment rate is theoretically the more perfect because no country can cheat on the unemployment rates , using different definitions of it and so on , it 's the same for everyone . 
  i meant the unemployed people in the public healthcare , i found strange they have n't free healthcare , or you meant they have to pay just for the `` smaller '' things ( i.e. 
  medical examinations ) while they get the serious things ( i.e. 
  operation ) for free ? 
   uer can be wildly misleading if a large section of the population have dropped out of the labour force . 
  yes , indeed i said that i believe employment rates to be better when describing the shape of the labour market in a country , it 's just that for the average joe who wants to get a job asap , lower the unemployment rate the better , the employment rate is useful when talking macro-economically . 
   that has happened in america for instance . 
  yes i was looking to that some days ago . 
  the us employment rate in the last 8 years fell more than italy 's and i did n't expect this , the obama 's leadership is often praised for having brought the us out from the crisis so fast yet the debt to gdp ratio went from 60 % to 100 % and we 've just talked about their employment rate change . 
  in italy the situtation is quite strange and it 's linked to the fact we have the largest numbers of inactive people in the eu both in raw numbers and as % of the workforce , and the employment rate is mostly dragged down by sicily and campania , above all naples ' province where 20,1 % of the women in working age have a declared ) job ( no , i 'm not joking ) , that 's less than 1/3 the percentuage of the best perfoming provinces in emilia romagna , but even northern italy lags almost a 10ish points behind , say , southern germany or sweden . 
  we 're currently witnessing an increase in both the employed ( from 57,1 % to 57,3 % in one month , 15-64 age group ) and the unemployed people ( from 11,5 % to 11,6 % ) , and that 's because the inactive people are steadily decreasing month by month ; we could semplify this , more or less , by inactive people becoming unemployed ( i.e. 
  in search of an occupation ) and the latter becoming employed . 
  at this rate in the 2017 q1-2 italy could have a record-high employment rate , higher than the one recorded in april 2008 ( 58,9 % ) . 
  this means a little though , as the nominal gdp per capita will always be 10 % lower than 2007 's peak and it will hardly recover before 2025 . 
  spain on other hand is living the opposite situation , as gdp will catch up with pre-crisis level way before than the employment rate will , and that 's why their productivity is rising so fast . 
  i did n't expect it , vienna in this field is somewhat similar to brussels then , with very high unemployment rates compared to the national average . 
  anyway , i have n't understood if those are the people without a job ( unemployed + inactive ) or just the unemployed ( currently searching an occupation ) , i hope u/alelo can clarify that . 
  but is ** in search of occupation ** or ** without a job ** ? 
  because the latter includes the inactivle peope who are never consider when calculating unemployment rate ... 
  but whay do they have to pay , a ticket i guess ? 
  i do n't think they have to pay tens of thousands $ for an operation like in the us if you are n't insured ... 
  is n't healthcare already free for everyone ? 
  low salaries compared to western europe , still a lot higher than they could earn in their home countries . 
  i really do n't know what the situations in cz is like but if it 's getting serious , if i were your president i 'd start paying the voyage to the foreigners willing to work in cz and providing them a free course of basic czech . 
  come one , this situation is better than having people being fired and employment troubles , is n't it ? 
  i dare to doubt automations will have dramatical effects in our lives in the next decade . 
  if anything you have to keep importing ukrainians/other nationalities ' workers for the cheaper jobs . 
  i did n't say that what dst does is wrong or the unemployement rates by eurostat are perfect either but it 's a good way to calculate unemployment rates for the eu countries in the same conditions . 
  almost 11 % ? 
  really ? 
  anyway , here you go  an unemployed person is defined by eurostat , according to the guidelines of the international labour organization , as someone aged 15 to 74 without work during the reference week who is available to start work within the next two weeks and who has actively sought employment at some time during the last four weeks . 
  the unemployment rate is the number of people unemployed as a percentage of the labour force . 
  not by the measure eurostat used, 
  yes but one 'd have to look for all the datas in the native languages in the national stastitics institutions ' sites , i do n't know if there 's someone collecting such datas every month . 
  btw for italy every month our unemployment rate is always the same as that calculated by eurostat . 
  i myself often use employment rates , preferring them in macro-economics contexts as they show the shape of the labour market in a country , but in micro-economics ones the unemployment rate is what matters for the single person . 
  but are n't they counted as inactive people ? 
  because southern italy has a similar problem yet this reflects in the crazy-low employement rates ( not to be confused with unemployment ones ... ) of such regions , as most of people working under the table are inactive , not unemployed ( in search of occupation ) . 
  maybe in spain/greece there are unemployment benefits and considering the chances of getting a job are still pretty low they work cash in hand while getting benefits ? 
  maybe it 's just the author of this map is someone from france/italy/spain :p, 
  it 's eurostat , they use the same method for every country , so that though it 's not perfect it 's the same everywhere without distortions for some countries . 
  dst may have another ways to calculate unemployement , that 's it . 
  source : eurostat , [ unemployment statistics ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/unemployment_statistics ) . 
  everything under 4-5 % unemployment is just frictional unemployment . 
  let me guess , you googled `` xxxxxx unemployment rate '' and copied and pasted the 17 months-old google datas that appear in first position ? 
  just search for the datas you wan na know on tradingeconomics , i believe you 're smart enough to do that on your own . 
  your total unemployement datas are outdated for all the countries you mentioned, 
  no , it 's 43,9 % in spain in may 2016 . 
  veneto 's claims for independence are pretty a joke tho , the independence 's party got 1-2 % in the regional elections . 
  i myself often prefer using nominal instead of ppp , at parity of conditions i think the first is better because it shows the real richness produced without inflating or deflating it , it 's just that often the nominal gdp is skewed by other circumstances , such as national banks ' intervents or currency swings like in this case , so for all its faults ppp is the lesser evil when comparing a country with another one with undervalued currency ( ex . 
  see russia now , for sure it 's in recession but no way its gdp lost almost the half of its value , ruble did instead ) or overvalued ( ex . 
  see the uk before 24 june , it had an higher nominal gdp per capita than germany and the netherlands when on reality it was on par with france 's ) . 
  when comparing instead similar economies using the same currency ( the euro ) i agree on using nominal gdp . 
   are you calling me a racist ? 
  / s black is not politically correct . 
  / s jokes aside , exactly , the definition you just gave is the right one . 
  grey economy is a more correct term imho . 
  eur got underpriced towards the usd in the last two years so all the ez economies had a 20 % drop in their nominal gdp more or less ; you should watch at ppp change for once . 
  no way spain lost 28 % of its gdp considering it misses a 3-4 % to recover to 2007 level . 
  anti-vaccination campaigns with city 's money and planes forbidden to fly over turin in 3 , 2 , 1 ... 
  italy is already a net contributor fyi . 
  democracy = / = tyranny of the majority , assuming there have n't been electoral frauds of course . 
  yes , they are against vaccinations and they believe to chemtrails and the nwo . 
  yes right now you can go back on daily mail comments . 
  france has a huge trade deficit with spain and is the first spanish export market . 
  ... is n't that what i said ? 
  nobody said you export nothing , just that you do n't export a lot , proportioned to population ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_exports_per_capita ) and import tons of things . 
  the us does n't export a lot for a country that size but it 's pretty other way around , they import a loads of things , being the largest market in the world . 
  detox yourself . 
  drugs are bad for you . 
  have a look [ here ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/tx.val.manf.zs.un ) . 
  manufacturing exports are the majority in the developed countries , even in the more services-driven ones . 
  seems like canada will delete visas for ro/bg within a year , i do n't think they 'll be veto-ing the deal after that . 
  so delusional . 
  hilarious that erdogan is getting support by some people through the social networks he censored/forbidden ... 
  anyway i find strange that the soldiers have n't shot at the civilians for erdogan but instead they retreated , the civilians do n't even have guns , if they really fail the coup with the aviation which seems supporting them , they are really noobs . 
  i hope the best for turkey, 
  estonian drug induced mortality = x ( number_of_adults_in_estonia ) : 98 = 1,000,000 : 113,2 lithuanian drug induced mortality = x ( number_of_adults_in_lithuania ) : 87 = 1,000,000 : 44,2 you have to take in account the 15-64 population , they are less than one million in estonia . 
  berlusconi was never head of state thanks god , only head of government, 
  the socioeconomic status of the population is based on income and education , even your graph says that , you 're misleading it with the better life index . 
  btw , a relevant part of the indexes ( in general ) are useful as toilet paper , the actual statistics are what you have to look at .
