  if you are talking about services , finance/banks and multinational companies fair enough , but uk 's manufacturing added value is definitely lower than italy 's though . 
  that 's very subjective though . 
   brands like maserati and lamborghini have an excellent reputation abroad . 
  yes i know , i replied to the other guy indeed as i thought he was talking aout fiats , 
  let 's be fair with them , fiat cars still have a bad reputation ( especially abroad , but often even in italy ) but nowadays with marchionne 's leadership it 's pretty undeserved . 
  he saved without any state aid a company that in 2003 was on the brink of bankruptcy and actually pumped billions $ of investements in efficiency , quality , cost and supply chain management into italy 's fca production sites ; for instance , every year pomigliano d'arco fca car plant near naples ( once a money blackhole for the company and kept alive thanks to state aid ) , tops the japanese world class manufacturing index , with the other southern italian plants coming there closer . 
  the bad name comes from the 1970s-1990s period when their car plants were in general inefficient and plagued by turmoils with labour unions , constant strikes and sometimes even premeditated sabotages from their own workers ( once a friend of my grandfather found a fabric cloth under the car 's gearshift ) . 
  but things have changed a lot and so did their cars ' quality and we would be in bad faith not to admit it , despite - of course - not all of their cars are top-notch and there is still a way to go . 
   no it would be a disaster for italy in most respects finally you admitted it !, 
  fyi employment in italy is already growing ( for the younger people as well ) , just like the exports , the factory orders and the manufacturing jobs . 
   it 's not doing well enough with the lira instead would there be an economic boom ? 
   so should you be . 
  about what ? 
   increase employment that 's what italy is already doing without devaluating , thank you for your concern . 
   the bottom 1/5 of mississippians , the poorest state in the us , have more wealth than the median italian . 
  do you * seriously * believe that ? 
  i mean , if you are trolling it 's okay and we can all have a laugh , but otherwise ... as you are talking about wealth , let 's have a look at the [ median wealth per adult ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult ) . 
  but was n't the median american much wealthier than the median italian and `` the poorest americans more well off than the average italian '' ? 
  either the us is the most equal country in the world or you are talking rubbish . 
  ps ,  you 're seriously underestimating how rich the us is and how poor italy is . 
  lol, 
  has he himself been found guilty of corruption ? 
  what 's your definition of a corrupt party ? 
  if its secretary is corrupt ? 
  if the majority of its members are ? 
  also , the penal responsibility is personal and has nothing to do with his party . 
  either if we are talking of dijsselbloem or guindos , i 'd wait for a court 's final verdict before calling anyone corrupt . 
  then the average is more than 1 % ? 
  it 's * a lot * , do n't know if you realize it . 
  it 's more than the us and a little bit less than australia . 
  unless you apply sub-saharan standards of growth to western countries . 
   you ever wonder why scandinavia is rich ? 
  low population ... which is increasing at a very fast rate ( together with the economy ) , but k. 
  it has grown a lot , but not that much . 
  use constant prices . 
  afaik danish and bulgarian currencies are pegged with the $, 
  they are not part of the ez, 
  but a moderate inflation helps the economy , whatever country it is . 
  but it 's good for the economy ( as long it 's a moderate one ) . 
  who are the creditors in this context ? 
  whole countries ? 
  everyone is getting less interests on their savings , what a surprise ? 
   yes , southern europe financially profits from qe measures while they harm northern europe so in the last two years northern europe had  2 % inflation rates i guess , whereas only southern europe was in deflation ? 
  the inflation is slowly returning all over the eurozone , but just in these last 3-4 months . 
  the eurozone saw a 2 % yoy inflation rate just in this february after lots of months . 
  most of the ez countries need higher inflation rates , does n't matter where they are geographically located . 
  ah , nice sources . 
   they already do via the ultra-low interest rates and how this affects the pockets of germans and dutch citizens ? 
  interest rates in the last two years are in a record low everywhere . 
   qe measures of the ecb . 
  only italy or southern europe do benefit from qe ? 
  do you believe qe is a ez internal wealth transfer ? 
   and i have already heard many italians claiming that there should even be much more transfers in the eurozone got that , pratically they are virtually paying us because some italians ( of course not me ) said that . 
  also , do `` much more transfers '' imply italy becoming a even bigger contributor then , right ? 
  since when are germans and dutch paying for italy indeed ? 
  rates for 1000 people, 
  but current prices are biased by inflation, 
  why using current prices though ? 
  it 's adjusted to the us prices level . 
  russia devalutated its currency , but that 's a problem only because you are looking at nominal gdp in ** current ** prices by wikipedia . 
  just take a look at [ gdp in ** constant ** prices ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.kd?locations=ru ) which does n't take neither currency swings nor inflation into account , but just the real growth rates . 
   adjusted dollars it 's not the currency being adjusted , it 's the gdp , adjusted at the us prices level . 
  again , imho nominal it 's better for various reasons , but it 's just my opinion . 
  wait , are we talking about what currency should be used for measuring gdp or if ppp is better than nominal ? 
  you convert it in usd , but you could convert it in eur too , or in gbp , why not , in every currency as long as we 're using constant prices . 
  usd is the most used because it 's the most important currency in the world . 
  gdp ppp is often measured in $ as well . 
  is it wrong ? 
  i must have missed it then, 
  i did not know this , lol, 
  gdp measures the market value of an economy . 
  nobody ever said it has to be in usd . 
  you can find nominal gdp in $ too , for instance . 
  also , look at the added value . 
  gdp measures the market value of an economy , not the standards of living of a country . 
  you should adjust the income to ppp at most , not the gdp . 
  in the more expensive country there is a much higher cash flow and thus the market value of the economy is much higher , that 's why nominal gdp is better imho . 
  gdp is not a measure of well being and standard of living . 
  also the added value per capita and per person employed would be very skewed if adjusted by ppp . 
  edit : typo, 
  tens and tens come from the netherlands , like the biggest house record labels do ... 
  he 's pretty known , but not as popular as martin garrix or hardwell nowadays . 
  also 150k moldavans, 
  it 's cesenatico , not that far though, 
  because every ( actual ) refugee is a human needing help and as such he/she deserves it wherever he comes from . 
   why are n't all moroccan 's deported then ? 
  because being part of an ethnic group is not enough to make you guilty of something . 
  ironic how you want to defend `` european civilization '' and then give your endorsement to such barbarities . 
  also detained does n't mean convicted , or did we forget this too ? 
  we want to protect our civilization and then we fall that low ? 
   which strikes me as odd considering how well-situated they are over there and italian labour is n't that expensive . 
  well , they closed down a plant in sicily in 2011 ( who was making lancia ypsilon ) and outsourced the production in poland as it was less expensive to ship cars from there to northern italy ( the main market for that car ) than it was for the sicilian factory . 
  a plant in czech republic or slovakia is very well linked to europe 's main markets , it 's also about logistics , but not just that : the labour is also very expensive compared to eastern europe , a worker in italy costs 5 times more than it does in serbia , where fca has another factory . 
  * vehicles this also included vans , buses and trucks . 
   who would have thought that 15 or 10 years ago !? 
  i 'd add more years . 
  the italian car industry entered in a deep crisis in the first 2000s , was partially recovering in 2006-2007 and then was crashed again by the crisis . 
  it 's currently recovering very fast due to the boom in car sales , [ the production ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_motor_vehicle_production ) increased by more than 50 % compared to 2013 . 
  remember that one third of italy 's vehicles production is lcvs though ( fiat ducato , peugeot boxer , citroen jumper and iveco daily ) and we would be scoring much worse if that map was only about passenger cars . 
  let alone the french vans ( psa has a joint-venture with fca ) , italy has n't any foreign car plant .
