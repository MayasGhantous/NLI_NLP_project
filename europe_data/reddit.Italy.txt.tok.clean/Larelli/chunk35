  do n't worry , you can still freely marry your other-sex partner without hurting anyone 's rights , go figure !, 
  he did n't say that directly , though . 
   `` how many times have we all heard people say ` if that person is a catholic , it is better to be an atheist ' . '', 
  no , use constant prices .

  looks like the differential in growth . 
  like if the uk in a x year grew by 3 % whereas the average in growth for germany + france + italy was 1 % , the differential would be 2 % . 
  the trendline is the trend , until the half of 80s the uk gdp per capita growth was heavily outperformed by germany + france + italy and after that has been the other way around . 
  [ here ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.kd.zg?locations=de-gb-fr-it ) you can find the datad for gdp per capita growth . 
  [ here ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.kd?locations=de-gb-fr-it ) the gdp per capita ( in constant prices , as it should ) . 
   the employees number does n't include the subsistence farmers . 
  the 3 million is probably  98 % subsistence farming . 
  are you sure about that ? 
  romania 's employment rate is not * that * bad , and over 25 % of the employed people work in the agriculture . 
  those 3 million people are most likely included : according to eurostat the number of employed people in romania is over 8,2 m. 
  it has one of the highest population density in the continent ... 
  when eurostat will publish current account for 2016 i will make a map as % of gdp . . 
  yes , it 's all a plot . 
  i know though : , 
  intentionally misleading ? 
  uk and germany are knowledge-intensive economy though , the first in financial services and the last in manufacturing . 
  italy on other hand is still too much of a labour-intensive economy ( e.g. 
  italy is the country with the smallest % of graduated people in the eu and has a very high share of manufacturing employment by western standards ) . 
  it already is , but in the long run it might be even more a problem . 
  too many shades would be needed to use only two colours without using too similar shades though  thanks for the suggest anyway , i 'll remember it for the maps with less shades !, 
  coff coff ... 
  what 'd be the middle colour between blue and yellow ? 
  also , is n't yellow too light to show who 's perfoming at the end of the legend ? 
   so whats a typical good that is produced in the uk ? 
  top gear and nissan qashqai !, 
  jokes aside , the uk is pretty strong in the aerospace industry . 
  this map is about trade in goods though . 
  # = / = $ also this includes services . 
  yes , and rome ( 1285km \u00b2 ) is the 2nd biggest european commune after much more popolous london ( 1579km \u00b2 ), 
  make rome great again . 
  yes , sweden * had * a trade surplus . 
  but in your own source you can see that in 2015 sweden had a trade surplus in the first semester and a deficit in the second one and this is getting worse ( look at yoy change ) . 
  this year indeed you got a very small $ 0,7 bn deficit for the first time . 
  also i suspect that the second source is about current account ( i do n't know swedish ) . 
  no , if they go through the harbours they are counted like exports/imports even though they are produced in other countries . 
   products produced in germany and shiped to china via rotterdam should not count as a dutch export . 
  they do though , indeed . 
  that 's why the netherlands have a crazy high extra-eu trade deficit but an even more crazy-high intra-eu surplus that allows the netherlands to have the second biggest trade balance in europe . 
  what sites ? 
  just use constant prices : http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.kd?locations=de-gb, 
  services are n't included in this map . 
  no problem , then red = good green = bad / s, 
  it includes raw materials and energy as well . 
  anyway most of times trade in services is not included in the trade balance , it 's included in the current account . 
   a 1.75 % increase in exports is pretty standard . 
  yes , a fall of the imports for a country like the uk is not , though . 
   change : 4 % increase y.o.y. 
  yes , in 2014 . 
  in 2016 things did n't go as smoothly for nearly all the eu countries . 
  let 's see what 2017 will bring us . 
   the depreciation of gbp on eur and usd is already being reported as increasing uk exports for 2017 . 
  imports ( let 's not take the gbp devaluation into account ) increased by more than 8 % in december 2016 yoy . 
  they actually grew a lot during the last year . 
  i repeat , the uk imports are n't going to decrease unless a crisis happens . 
  and exports are n't going to increase by a percentuage that outperforms imports ' growth in absolute numbers , unless the world lives a * trading fever * and you manage to not let imports grow in the meantime . 
  capital account is not included . 
  it 's too low imho . 
  let alone czech republic , the datas for ee countries are quite unsatisfying ( especially for romania ) given that at least the v4 countries are well integrated in the german supply chain and several factories from western countries outsourced there . 
  ehm , the deficit in 2016 is $ 204,5 bn . 
   very achievable . 
  yes , if you make an autarchy-program or enter a crisis that hits the internal market lowering consumptions , without lowering exports . 
  in times like these it 's very hard to get a substantial increase in exports too . 
  i looked a bit on eurostat database but i could n't find nothing about services being divided in more branches , sorry you could send a ticket to eurostat admins if you are interested on the numbers . 
  [ current account ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/a/a6/current_and_capital_accounts%2c_2015_%28eur_billion%29_yb16.png ) includes trade in services . 
  it 's very hard to make such a correlation only using these datas . 
  there are datas in negative numbers , it would be even harder to use the shades of blue . 
  otherwise what colors should i have used , from violet to brown ? 
  anyway people have their own brain to judge if a number is good or bad . 
  it 's simply not possible unless the uk start an autocracy-program in the next year , or you halve your imports or double your exports . 
  also eurostat 's datas are on eur , you could be get such a reduction if eur/gbp change reaches 0,50 or something like that . 
  but then again it would be much harder to export things at that point , so ... 
   pizza with ketchup and pineapples . 
  screw you-a . 
  yeah , but tbf an huge part of that balance is because the netherlands imports ( through its harbours ) a lot of germany 's imports from asia and then export them in germany . 
  goods , raw materials and energy [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/a/a6/current_and_capital_accounts%2c_2015_%28eur_billion%29_yb16.png ) for the current account and services balance . 
  eh , how you can esteem that by three years it 's going to be reduced by 43 % when it 's instead increasing ? 
  in which year ? 
  maybe the current balance ? 
  could i have a source ? 
  not trade in services but it includes trade in raw materials and energy . 
   `` uk trade of goods , balance '' is charted to reach $ 115bn by 2020 , a ~ 45 % reduction . 
  it should almost halve whereas it 's increasing . 
  are you sure that would be possible ? 
  this map is not abount current account , though, 
  italy 's imports are way lower than those of the uk or france . 
  this reflects both that france and uk have an higher total purchase power / consumptions and the fact that in italy things ( home appliances , furniture , bathroom fixtures , clothes , shoes etc. 
  - less so for cars ) tend to be more domestically-made than in france and especially the uk . 
  scotland 's gdp is $ 172bn . 
  it still would n't work :p, 
  yeah , but the smaller countries have already very high volumes of trade as % of gdp . 
  it would change a bit compared to using gdp as a meter , but not * that * much . 
  it 's - a me . 
  you should 've used * metropolitan area * , though , the second biggest city by area is ravenna ( after rome ) , 
  indeed it does n't mean it 's necessarily bad , it 's up to the reader realizing what it is .
