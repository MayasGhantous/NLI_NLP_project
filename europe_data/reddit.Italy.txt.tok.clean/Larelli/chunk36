  the green-yellow-red is the most natural scale there is , otherwise i should have used the light blue-blue-dark-blue scale eurostat often uses , but with that imho it 's very hard to notice the difference between similar gradations . 
  this is trade balance in goods , not the current account . 
  no , most of countries increased their surplus or lowered their deficits . 
  thank you !, 
  as i have already wrote the gdp for 2016 is not available yet . 
  if you want to , you can search for gdp in 2015 and calculate the % . 
  i 'd wait the datas for 2016 though : for example ireland in 2015 grew by 25 % and that was really unexpected . 
  we should wait for the new datas , using the old ones might be a bit misleading as i posted the balance for 2016 . 
  yes , but in general services are used only when it comes to current account . 
  no , it 's called absolute numbers . 
  would the total gdp be worthless as well because it 's not per capita ? 
  total . 
  the inside-eu ( and extra-eu ) balance is at page 3 of the source i posted . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2q0t7qxets / s, 
  yes , my master . 
  they may be a bit outdated though . 
  let 's just wait for the updated ones . 
  gdps and populations by eu countries in 2016 have not been released yet . 
  when eurostat will publish them i might make a map about that too , maybe with current account instead of trade balance in goods , who knows . 
  do n't worry , economy does n't understand itself as well ^ / s, 
  that would save your balance just for a year though :d, 
  no , [ current account ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/a/a6/current_and_capital_accounts%2c_2015_%28eur_billion%29_yb16.png ) includes them . 
  you mean trade inside the eu and extra-eu ? 
  it 's all in the source , page 3 . 
  pretty sure the majority of your deficit comes from london metro area alone ( it produces very little in terms of goods , has not an harbour like rotterdam and it imports * a lot * because of a very high purchasing power ) . 
  yes . 
  [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/a/a6/current_and_capital_accounts%2c_2015_%28eur_billion%29_yb16.png ) there is the current accounts in 2015 ( which are not the same as balances of trade in goods ) , including services . 
  it 's goods , not only manufactured ones . 
  it includes raw materials and energy too . 
  [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/a/a6/current_and_capital_accounts%2c_2015_%28eur_billion%29_yb16.png ) you go for services ( and current account in general ) . 
  the source is this : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7876086/6-15022017-ap-en.pdf/059d951b-e122-407c-b202-0cf2213cd568 ( page 3 )  who releases the gdp figures you are waiting for ? 
  eurostat . 
  ** in ** the eu countries with every other country , not ** with ** the other eu countries . 
  the netherlands have always had among the highest trade balances in europe , no surprise . 
  rotterdam 's harbour accounts for a huge part of the surplus !, 
  alright , but the datas for gdps of the member states in 2016 have not been released yet , 
  source : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7876086/6-15022017-ap-en.pdf/059d951b-e122-407c-b202-0cf2213cd568 ( page 3 ) i apologize for any mistake i could have made while making this map !, 
  that 's a pity , i often use street view in the european countries ' main cities and highways and germany and austria are huge losses : <, 
  the us have a sky-high number of multinational companies that inflate their gdp . 
  they might be likely to dodge some hundreds of millions $ in taxes in fiscal havens , but wo n't hire a worker under the table . 
  in general , though there are exceptions , the shadow economy as % of gdp is somewhat correlated with self-employment rate and with a number of workers/enterprise much lower than the oecd average . 
  yes it 's true - italian wages and competitiveness in general compared to the rest of europe have been falling since the late 90s . 
   but i do n't think that germany is the only country outgrowing our wages . 
  i used germany as an example because they had a very strong wage growth in the last decade with a substantial reduction of unemployment rate . 
  anyway as i said it 's very hard to get a strong wage growth while having a huge unemployment problem . 
  other southern european countries performed even worse than italy for instance . 
  fair enough , but that 's completely another thing compared to what op said . 
  but you ca n't expect wages to grow as much as germany 's in the last decade when unemployment has gone up though . 
   if the wages keep decreasing source ? 
  how about using constant prices , uh ? 
  so it was the first one , that 's it . 
  have you logged from the wrong alt account or now are you talking on behalf of your comrade above that has n't even replied yet ? 
  in what universe is not the prosecution who has to bring sources ? 
  i have an hard time thinking of a comment containing more bs than his one , indeed it 's no wonder he did n't even bring one link or an actual source . 
  `` facts '', 
  well , they lost more or les 15 % of their gdp in current prices but there were still differences in real growth rates : in 2015 for instance italy grew by 0,7 % whereas germany and the uk grew by respectively 1,7 % and 2,3 % . 
  [ here ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.kd?locations=it-gb-de-fr-ru ) you can see the time series for gdp in constant prices for europe 's main economies . 
  not exactly . 
  he 's using current prices , one should look at constant ones . 
  the drop in 2015 is due to the eur devalutation towards the usd , not a real recession . 
  indeed italy is a net contributor as well , do n't worry . 
   bit of a stretch , your net contribution is roughly 5 billion euros and will be lower next year . 
  source ? 
   on par with the poorest ce countries/regions southern italy is way richer than almost all of eastern europe outside the capital cities by nominal gdp per capita . 
   apparently northern italy grows while southern italy shrinks . 
  that 's not even true . 
  why on the earth italy should have lower standards of livings that the cee countries now ? 
  if anything we are paying you btw ... 
  well , you wrote  how much wealth the individual citizens are likely to have and i linked the median wealth per adult . 
   how good things really are in a nation by wealth per capita alone . 
  that 's a subjective thing . 
   i mean there are a lot of unknowns that going by wealth alone is n't going to answer . 
  it 's not like an inflated gdp is any better if you wan na measure the standards of living ...  in a country with no health care people are going to need more wealth in order to be able to pay for that . 
  almost all the eu countries have free and rather good healthcare systems . 
   it does n't say anything about costs of living and stuff like that either . 
  a lot of things cost the same everywhere . 
  also if with those money you wan na buy an house in say spain the ppp-adjustament will be useless . 
   so yeah i still think gdp per capita is going to be a better measure of how well a nation is doing . 
  to measure how well a nation * is doing * you should use gdp growth rates . 
  if anything you would want to measure how much well off a nation is . 
  but i repeat , when it comes to citizens wealth is more useful than gdp . 
  look at ireland for that matter . 
  btw , gdp ppp is not a direct measure of standards of living . 
   that lead to very low saving rates actually italy had [ the highest saving rates ] ( http://media.economist.com/sites/default/files/cf_images/20050409/csf656.gif ) in the western world back in the 80s and 90s , that 's the reason the wealth per adult in italy is so high . 
  the banks are weak because they have a shit-ton of npls ( mostly due to constructions sector 's dive ) and we did n't fix the problem in 2010-2011 like other countries ( such as spain ) did . 
  italy has seen growth too , it 's on general far lower than the eu average though . 
  is it the festival of the common places ? 
   how much wealth the individual citizens are likely to have https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult, 
   data is based on projection by imf outlook october 2016 . 
   therefore it does not at all reflect quality of life . 
  since when does gdp have to reflect it ? 
  gdp is about showing the market value of an economy and that 's what nominal does best . 
  there are other measurements for standard of living . 
  no , it 's not . 
  it shows the real market value of an economy . 
  if you are interested in standard of living there are other measurements . 
   the uk , spain and italy are the most unequal countries . 
  it 's always been like that in the past decades in both years of growth and recession , it matters very little if a country has been doing better in the recent years and another one has been doing worse . 
  it 's quite skewed , though . 
  it 's measuring a variation in current prices .
