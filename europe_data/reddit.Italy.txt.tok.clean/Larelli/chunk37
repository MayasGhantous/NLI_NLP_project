  gdp ppp per capita in current prices as % of the eu-28 average . 
  i meant nominal gdp per capita . 
  anyway , to measure how much well off an average citizen of a country is you should use the disposable income ( adjusted ppp maybe ) and the median wealth . 
  gdp tells us the market value of an economy . 
  that 's gdp ppp though . 
  nominal figures would be really different . 
  paywall . 
  anyway , unless a stagnation in the last quarter which is very unlikely , you should have beaten q2 2008 's peak in q4 2016 . 
  the service sector is above pre-crisis levels since almost two years , it 's the manufacturing and above all construction sectors dragging down the average . 
  spain has very likely recovered to the pre-crisis gdp levels at the end of 2016 though . 
  eh , libyans legally residing in italy are 1.819 , one thousand eight hundreds and nineteen . 
  romanians on other hand are 1.151.395 . 
  a factory in girona is much more closer to germany than one in c\u00e1diz . 
  logistic plays a very big role in industry and therefore in trade . 
   no idea how it manages to get top 4 natural gas, 
  romania , you got a ban !, 
  so do you beieve seat 's management has not put enough effort to promote spain abroad ? 
  a brand does n't depend on a country as a whole just because it 's x country though , but on its companies and industrial fabric . 
   but that 's concentrated mostly in three fields . 
  it 's still very high by any standard . 
   since we sold seat to germans vag is not owned by the german people , it 's a multinational . 
  i can understand taking pride about having a car manufacturer with the hq in your country and not owned by anyone , but does it really matter ? 
  does it matter that much if in wikipedia seat has a german flag or a spanish one ? 
  the really important things are three : investments , added value and employment . 
  seat seems to be doing very well lately , what 's the problem if in the paper is not spanish ? 
  fca for example , three years ago , moved its hq from turin to amsterdam to avoid taxes , yet at the same time it started doing great in italy and has hired 6000 people since then . 
  and to me seat remains a spanish brand , just like lamborghini is italian or opel is german . 
   the only spanish businesses in that field are building parts , and most of them could be replaced if the production goes elsewhere . 
  why should they go elsewhere if spain 's car production does great like it 's doing ? 
   but it 's not the best situation either . 
  the best is yet to come . 
  but france is increasing its population by hundreds of thousands people a year ( positive natural balance + immigration ) and it helps a lot the construction sector and the consumptions , thus creating jobs over jobs for the immigrants too . 
  also france has n't a very big unemployment problem . 
  such phenomenon is even more accentuated in the uk and outside europe in the us , canada , australia etc. 
   foreign investors , because of the image we have sold of spain , like sun , beaches , tourism and so on , they do n't consider it seriously . 
  that 's not entirely true , spain gets a very high amount of fdis as % of gdp ( a lot of foreign car manufacturers have a plant in spain and they invest pretty heavily in them , see what valencia'a ford has done in the recent years ) and they help the gdp growth really a lot . 
  for instance , compare spain 's gdp growth with italy 's which is a country that actually gets a low amount of fdis , proportioned to its gdp . 
  exactly . 
  population increase is a main motor of economic growth . 
  it especially helps the construction sector but almost all the other ones as well , from commerce to services for people , from retail to manufacturing . 
  fair enough , but it looks like they are referring to the map about disposable income . 
  that 's gas money indeed . 
  often the gdp is inflated by other factors while the inhabitants of a certain region are n't as wealthy as their gdp per capita shows . 
  why are they misleading gdp with disposable income ? 
  also , in my opinion , using nominal constant prices when talking about gdp per capita is the most correct thing ; eurostat always uses current prices ppp in these maps which is as worse as it can get . 
  indeed , if you look at the [ gdp change 2008-2014 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/dd/change_of_gross_domestic_product_%28gdp%29_per_inhabitant_in_purchasing_power_standard_%28pps%29_in_relation_to_the_eu-28_average%2c_by_nuts_2_regions%2c_2008%e2%80%9314_%28%c2%b9%29_%28percentage_points_difference_between_2008_and_2014%29_ryb2016.png ) ( which the author did n't even link ) and then you look at the datas in constant prices you 'll see that the map looks quite skewed , especially for spain ( letting alone that this map is gdp per capita as % of the eu average , thus the regions where the gdp per capita is much higher than the average will drop much more points compared with a region below the average even though they lost the same real gdp per capita ) . 
  but you ca n't use 2015 datas to talk about the real economy , that 's the year where eur lost about 15 % of value towards the usd , currency used to measure the economy . 
  every ez countries got a 15 % drop on their nominal current market prices gdp in $ compared to 2014 because of that , barring the `` real '' growth rates . 
  you should use [ 2010 $ constant prices ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.kd?locations=it-gb ) . 
  uk 's real gdp is about $ 600 bn higher than italy 's , now remove the other countries and london . 
  ah , be careful : london is 22 % of the ** uk ** economy , not just england 's . 
  england 's gdp without london is thus a bit less than $ 1,8 trillions ( higher than italy 's only per capita ) . 
  if you remove the whole south-east you 'd get definitely different figures though . 
  anyway kudos for the effort to bring sources . 
   which is still larger than the gdp of italy including rome despite londonless england having a population of just 45m compared to italy 's 65m ... no . 
  first , italy has 60m people . 
  second , if you use current market prices take into account the gbp recent devaluation . 
  otherwise use costant prices . 
  in both case , england 's gdp without london is n't higher than italy 's . 
  and scotland has an higher gdp per capita than england without london . 
  surely , belgium has a rather big homegrown export industry ( pharma too , for one ) . 
  yet it 's mostly due to antwerp 's harbour if it 's at such high levels . 
  belgium 's intra eu exports are 72 % of the total ones . 
  antwerp harbour is the key, 
  i agree , 20-64 gives a better perspective . 
  at this point i 'd extend the age to 69 , most of people in mid and late 60s are working and they often do n't get counted considering in most of cases the employment rate is 15-64 . 
  yes , sorry , my bad . 
  the usual share for working age is 15-64 , but eurostat often uses 20-64 . 
  this is n't the employment rate , but the share of ~ ~ 15 ~ ~ 20-64 population in the total population . 
  got that , thanks . 
   a percentage of that car 's value gets added to your taxable income more or less it works the same in italy if you have a vat number . 
  easter egg, 
  eh , indeed . 
  you use your savings to buy a car , not the gdp per capita ppp ( you do n't earn it and car prices are more or less the same everywhere , unless there is a special taxation , like in denmark ), 
  yes, 
  median wealth per capita is a more useful measure in such case . 
  source : http://www.acea.be/uploads/news_documents/20170117_prpc_1612_final.pdf in the pdf you can see the datas for the car producers / brands as well . 
  the datas exclude vans , trucks , motorbikes etc , it 's just passenger cars . 
  since 2014 the european market has made a lot of growth in car sales , but the passenger car sales remain 6 % lower than the 2007 peak . 
  the negative variation is mostly ascribable to the southern european countries : both italy and spain , two of the major markets , still show volumes being about 30 % lower than their pre-crisis peak , despite the two-digits growth realized in the past two years . 
  on other hand , the cee countries have much higher volumes than a decade ago . 
  the uk has record high sales too . 
  germany is a particular case : in the last decade it showed [ stable ] ( https://www.statista.com/statistics/416827/passenger-car-sales-in-germany/ ) car sales except the 2009 monster-peak ( * in the middle of gfc * ) . 
  any dutch and swiss to explain us their countries ' negative variations compared to 2015 ? 
  economic disincentives for buying cars ? 
  public transport being always better ? 
  sorry for the shitty map , that 's the best i could make , 
  they can always refuse to eat it, 
   my citroen van jumpy or jumper ? 
  yes , months ago, 
  there is a fca plant in bursa . 
  what does australia have to do with this exactly ? 
  40 % of exports is relatively low for a small country . 
  that 's the percentuage of germany . 
  a lot of smaller countries easily go above 80 % . 
  yes , after rub was devalued by over 30 % . 
  that 's currency swings , not real economy . 
  correlation does not imply causation . 
  euro might have had a smaller negative effect , but financially speaking italy would be in worse shape than today if it had the lira considering the amount of the public debt . 
  the average italian factory is much , much smaller than germany 's though .
