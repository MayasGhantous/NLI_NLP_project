  yes , they still have the 2nd highest gdp per capita in the eu, 
  you can see the datas for nuts-3 in the eurostat database , just follow the procedure i posted . 
   this data is very distorted . 
  in what way ? 
  have you read the introduction ? 
  no , they will be released in march-april 2018 . 
  eastern europe ia slowly reducing the divergence , tbf . 
  slowly , but it 's on the right track . 
   ireland is a tax haven . 
  it has still the second highest gdp per capita in the eu . 
   besides , this map does not take the cost of living into account it has n't to , it 's not supposed to represent the standards of living . 
   or the fact only a % of that gdp ends up in the pockets of the average joe . 
  kuznets already spoke about that , 
  nuts-3 are a lot , it would take hours and hours to make a map with them and some of them are also extremely small to be seen . 
  you can still see their datas on eurostat database though . 
  you do realize what nuts-2 regions are ? 
  also ireland has two nuts-2 regions , but datas are only available for the country as a whole . 
  what romanian country ? 
  it 's nuts-2 regions . 
  the baltics have only one nuts-2 region , croatia has two . 
  for the third time , you do n't know what constant and current prices are , and evidently neither nominal nor gdp ppp . 
  stop grasping at straws , please . 
  i had to mention the constant prices in $ because you thought that the nominal gdp in costant prices adjusts only for inflation and adjusting for currency swings was only a gdp ppp 's prerogative . 
  the map is still reliable because almost all the eu countries share the same currency or have fixed and stable exchange rates . 
  the only major exception is the uk and i specified that in the introduction . 
  edit : typo, 
  eurostat does n't collect datas for them , but i checked the un 2015 list and andorra has a gdp per capita of about $ 40k , which at today 's currency exchange rate would put the city-state somewhere at more or less 130 % of the eu average . 
   thanks for the map anyway , you always do a great job  thank you very much !, 
   it would not account for the drop in uk nominal gdp . 
  just use constant prices in $ then . 
  let 's take [ russia ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.kd?locations=ru ) as an example : the rub lost half of its value towards the usd in the last years , yet russia nominal gdp in constant $ has n't dropped at all by such a percentuage , you 're indeed going to see the real gdp growth in the graph i posted . 
  i repeat : do you know the difference between constant and current prices ? 
  and more or less is worth 30 % of the french economy , letting alone that it has a huge influence on global finance and on france 's cultural presence . 
  no problem !, 
    that would be the northern netherlands , holland is the west coast and is sometimes incorrectly used to describe the rest of the country yes , i messed up in my mind the two regions . 
  before being cocky at least do you know the difference between costant and current prices ? 
  do you know that there is gdp ppp in current prices as well just like there is nominal gdp in constant prices ? 
   which makes this useless as a representation of regional development . 
  i clarified that in the introduction . 
  gdp is neither a measure of development nor of well-being . 
   that 's a different province . 
  perhaps you should read the argument . 
  ah pardon then , i thought you meant literally northern netherlands , not the amsterdam 's region . 
  until 2014 it was groningen to be the richest region . 
   it 's misleading though , as it 's just a cluster for many large companies oberbayern already hosts munich metro area , it 's just that it has a lot of companies there , but also r&d centres and production sites . 
   same tends to happen with capital regions . 
  a lot of hqs tend to be headquartered in the capitals . 
  color me surprised ? 
   you can for example see north holland being the highest in the netherlands that 's due to groningen 's gas fields . 
  afaik they even share the same airport for some airlines . 
   and that one are in slovakia ? 
  do you mean the green-ish region ? 
  well that 's what nuts-3 regions are for , sadly in general a lot of datas are missing for nuts-3 . 
   i was just pointing out that this map could provide a skewed perception of what ireland is like . 
  i tried to clarify that out in my introduction comment . 
  it 's highlighted all the lisbon metro area , not just the city itself . 
  anyway your point is valid for quite a lot of other eu regions . 
  if you are interested to them , there are datas for nuts-3 regions . 
  economically it does , and quite a lot . 
  prague is 112 % , but its metro ( nor urban ) area is not counted on its gdp . 
  it 's just the city itself . 
  i perfectly know , but we are still talking about gdp and you have it extremely high . 
  there is n't any other form of gdp - i mean there is the good old gni but that 's another question . 
  also , sure , americans companies have an huge role , but ireland is also very strong on it and pharmaceutical and electronic production . 
   we are n't all that loaded in truth , more or less the same as people in england would be . 
  i specified that gdp is not a measure of well-being of a nation . 
  ireland is the richest eu country after luxembourg . 
  that sliver of bavaria is n't exactly irrelavant , it 's oberbayern ( munich region ) which has over 4m people and it 's one of the most productive areas in europe , with lots of multinational companies having their hqs there . 
  maybe that might be somehwat valid for some very northern energy-based regions of scandinavia ( but to a small extent ) , but the richer regions are n't at all necessarily the least populated , neither in absolute terms nor per square km . 
  stockholm 's region for instance has over 2 million people . 
  the southern german regions enjoy a gdp per capita which is 50 % higher of the eu average and they have , in total , more than 25 million people - there are few countries in europe with an higher population . 
  i want to conclude saying that as long as we are joking it 's okay , but the last thing i want with this map is creating a race about who 's more hardworking than who and read dumb socioanthropological correlations . 
  i also hope i have not made any mistake while painting some regions , i would n't exclude that and i apologize in advance . 
  the eu average in 2015 is $ 28 ' 900 , the highest ranked regions are inner west london at 737 % , luxembourg at 312 % , stockholm and inner east london at 223 % , bruxelles at 219 % , hamburg at 214 % and hovedstaden ( denmark ) at 213 % . 
  the lowest ranked region is severozapaden ( bulgaria ) at 13 % . 
  for every question and clarification i am here , do n't hesitate bothering !, 
  good evening . 
  source : [ ** eurostat database ** ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database ) , ** regional economic accounts ** - follow this [ procedure ] ( http://image.prntscr.com/image/443ccd276fa24f34a1daa0f6a91a84f9.png ) , open the selected database `` gross domestic product ( gdp at current market pricesby nuts 2 region '' and then click the '' + '' on * unit of measure * and select `` euro per inhabitant in percentage of the eu average '' to view the datas . 
  i believe a few clarifications are needed , do n't skip them . 
  first of all , ** take the datas with a small grain of salt ** , especially for the united kingdom . 
  sadly eurostat does n't collect datas in constant prices but only in the current prices which , as we know , are biased by things such as inflation and currency swings . 
  in 2015 the sterling got much stronger towards the euro ( well , it 's actually the other way around , k ) and therefore the uk 's gdp per capita gained a lot of points as % of the average . 
  in 2016 it will happen exactly the opposite because of the sterling 's drop after the referendum on brexit . 
  both swings are n't and wo n't be real , it 's not like in 2015 the uk boomed and in 2016 it went into a * bloody * recession . 
  as the uk is n't exactly a small country that has had a relevant impact on the eu average , as it 's like the uk in 2015 had grown much faster than the eu average ( it has n't ) thus skewing the average and worsening ( more or less slightly ) the points of the regions from other countries . 
  looking at the datas for the past years i have estimated that the uk regions are definitely at least a 10ish points lower than the map suggests , whereas the other eu regions are 2-3 points higher than what it looks like in the map . 
  the difference is therefore small but it was one of the three reasons i made quite a long scale in the legend , in order to try to homogenize the datas and avoid putting regions in clearly different gradations just because of a point of difference . 
  ah , the last reason is that i actually have a fetish for long scales . 
  it 's not a misleading map in any way , but just bear in mind what i said above . 
  having said that , i still believe that this map , as much as it graphically may suck , ** still gives a reliable and decent representation of the gdp per capita in the eu regions ** ( as % of the eu-28 average ) . 
  as i could bet an eye of mine i 'll be receiving those , let 's answer in advance some ** f.a.q. ** !, 
   i am sure i have once seen a map like that where my region fared much better/worse than in this map , how come ? 
  and i am sure you mean [ eurostat gdp per capita map in ppp ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/d/da/gross_domestic_product_%28gdp%29_per_inhabitant_in_purchasing_power_standard_%28pps%29_in_relation_to_the_eu-28_average%2c_by_nuts_2_regions%2c_2014_%28%c2%b9%29_%28%25_of_the_eu-28_average%2c_eu-28_%3d_100%29_ryb2016.png ) . 
  not only the scale is ridiculously small - it 's pratically tailor-made for identifying the regions `` in transition '' ( 75-89 % ) and `` underdeveloped '' ( < 75 % ) who are going to take eu 's structural cohesion funds - but it 's in ppp . 
  fair enough that making insinuations is a sin , but if one wanted to , he could very well think that the reason for the european commision using ppp adjustement ( and not the nominal gdp ) to measure the state of development and then give the cohesion funds it 's a way to reduce the internal wealth gap ( actually much wider than the eurostat map seems to suggest ) in order to reduce the wealth transfers inside the union , which are already quite high , especially for the smaller countries ( proportioned to their gdps ) . 
  with this map my first aim is to fill an hole created by the lack of a map that represented the ( nominal ) gdp per capita of the eu regions . 
  how much a region 's economy is worth is much more well represented by the nominal gdp . 
  things such as average wage or disposable income are definitely more correlated with nominal gdp than with gdp ppp , for instance . 
  also it 's not our business if the gdp is actually produced there or it 's inflated by other things , we are talking about gdp , otherwise there are other measures such as the gni . 
  we could be arguing for hours about what of the two ( nominal or ppp ) is better , i 'll try to bring my own points in favour of the first as answers to some hypothetical thesis .
