   but if in the a country a x product is sold at $ 10 , in the b country the same product is sold at $ 5 , the gdp in the a country will be twice higher whereas the `` actual '' production is the same . 
  yes , and there is nothing wrong with it . 
  gdp aims to measure the ** value ** of an economy . 
  check ** value added ** , it ca n't be adjusted ppp ( maybe it could , but it would be very skewed ) . 
  when one talks about value added per capita , value added per employed person etc. 
  it 's the nominal value , not ppp . 
  the value added is calculated from economic output which is calculated from companies ' revenues too , what shall we do , adjust the revenues to ppp ? 
  that would inflate poorer countries ' real value added and deflate the latter for the richer countries only because they have higher cost of living , that 's indeed what ppp does . 
  do you know that the manufacturing added value is not the same as the industrial/manufacturing production index , right ? 
  the first measures the ** value ** , the latter measures ( for the vast majority ) the ** physical volume ** of production . 
  if a car plant a year produces 1 million cars and sells them for $ 10k and the next year the plant starts producing a new model and the plant produces half the cars but sells them at twice the price , the revenue and consequently ( more or less ) the added value will be the same , while the plant 's index of industrial production has almost halved ( almost , because you have to take in account the hours worked and the deflated production prince index too , but these two measures affect only for a small part the iip ) . 
  that 's because the * cost per unit produced * doubled . 
  the manufacturing added value goes in the gdp , not the index of industrial production . 
  often there is a correlation between the perfomances of both , but * not necessarily * . 
  also workers with much higher value added tend to have much higher wages than their peers in poorer countries or less profitable businesses . 
  that 's why manufacturing workers in richer countries tend to have high value added than workers in poorer countries making the same object that in the richer country has a much higher cost , let 's say cookies , to make a stupid example . 
  that 's also why , for instance , mechatronics workers tend ( in general ) to have higher wages than furniture workers . 
  also things such as economies of scale do have an huge role on the argument we are talking about . 
  if prices were supposed to be the same everywhere a textile worker in denmark would have a much more similar value added as a textile worker in vietnam than he actually has , while that 's obviously not true and the difference in their wages confirms that . 
  the same is valid for your original argument : the worker in the a country will have twice the value added than the worker in b country even though they 're making the same object and therefore he will have way higher wages than the latter . 
  maybe that may not be fair under a `` marxist-like '' point of view , but that 's how things work . 
  now that we have clarified that , using ppp adjustment makes no sense , the gdp is not earned ( letting alone that a lot of things nowadays cost the same everywhere , that 's another point i do n't wan na touch ) . 
  in the countries where life costs more there is then a much higher cash flow ( that goes in companies ' revenues , which in their turn form the value added etc. ), 
  and it has to be counted in the gdp , why should we deflate those countries ' gdps using the purchasing power parity adjustment ? 
  if you still prefer using gdp ppp for personal reasons noone is going to stop you , just know that it 's a flawed indicator . 
   why did n't you clearly write in the title it 's nominal gdp ? 
  nothing is casual , my friend . 
  putting it very rudely , nominal and ppp have n't the same `` dignity '' ( ? ) . 
  when one says gdp , it 's always nominal , then it may be in constant or in current prices . 
  ppp is an adjustment and therefore you have to underline that when you 're talking about it , by saying gdp ( ppp ) . 
  the same is not valid for nominal gdp which is the * pure form * of gdp . 
   but it 's not adjusted to ppp , then it does n't actually represent the quality of life . 
  listen , let 's keep being polite , but this is a huge bs and i have once read something like that . 
  gdp is not a measure of quality of life , it 's not even a measurement of standards of living or average wage , nor of disposable income , purchasing power or wealth per capita . 
  go figure if it 's a measurement of quality of life . 
  of course there is something of a correlation between gdp per capita and the said economic measurements ( quality of life is another thing ) , but there are also a lot of exceptions and you should consider other things , for one the historic ( well , let 's say in past decades ) taken region 's gdp per capita : hardly a region which has just reached a certain level of gdp per capita will have the same wealth of a region who still has that gdp per capita but has always had higher gdp per capita for decades than the first region . 
  wealth is accumulated , it does n't reset to zero every year . 
  i mean , even kuznets himself said that the well-being of a nation can not be easily deduced from his own creation , the gdp . 
   the graphics just sucks , you 'd better go playing soccer on the highway . 
  i love you too , but do you like shooting on the red cross , huh ? 
  i could reply that you suck , but i am not going to just because * you 're goddamn right * . 
  i do n't like it either , but i am not a designer nor i have high artistic talent and style . 
  i only hope it 's just that bit decent to be able to understand the regions ' rankings and inviduating patterns . 
   she was hot ^, 
  did you know that she has had an ( italian ) nationalist turn just a few weeks ago ? 
  florentine dialect . 
  it 's a dutch-based ( for tax reasons ) italian company .

  the golden era by definition was the renaissance , the second one , let alone the roman empire , was the 1960-2000 period imho . 
  there are common eu directives for that . 
  anyway , to drive a  7,5 t truck you need a cqc licence you can get after your 21st birthday and having passed an exam after several theoretical and practical lessons at the local authorized driving school . 
  i do n't know the details though . 
  about wages ... 
  i searched a bit on internet and found out that after taxes an italian trucker working only inside italy gets $ 1500-2000 whereas the ones working all across the continent may reach $ 3000 ( they have to be two weeks far from home ) . 
  in general they are pretty good even though the situation nowadays is pretty fucked up due to the crisis and the wage dumping from cee companies ( i often see more polish , romanian , hungarian etc. 
  trucks around than italian ones ) . 
  they are mostly made for an american public though . 
  i 'm [ really close ] ( https://www.politicalcompass.org/chart?ec=-3.13&amp;soc=-4.56 ) to you , op . 
  yes, 
  in italian fica ( pronounced the same as fika i believe ) means pussy, 
  italy too, 
  i do n't fully agree . 
  if in switzerland the total cost is $ 10000 while in ukraine is $ 2000 , in switzerland there is a five-times higher cash flow , thus the market value of the swiss economy ( let 's pretend that the economy is only made up by these light bulbs ) is five times higher . 
  adjusting gdp to cost of living makes little sense , it 's not like you earn it . 
  it 's supposed to tell you the total value of your economy and all the money flowing around it . 
  cost of life is wildly higher in switzerland than in ukraine , but so are incomes ( so people can afford much higher prices ) . 
  here we are talking about the value of an economy though . 
  by the way , you should look at the added value . 
  it ca n't be adjusted in ppp ( or better , it could but it would be skewed and far from reality ) . 
  the swiss manufacturing enterprise ( let 's say it employs 10 people , the same as the ukrainian one ) that produced these bulbs will have a manufacturing added value per worker always 5 times higher than the ukrainian factory , even though they produced the same number of bulbs . 
  thus , the swiss factory will have much more available cash to buy the new light bulbs ' production machine from a reutlingen 's enterprise which is sold at the same price everywhere across europe , and then automate the job of a worker and lay him off and then again investing the saved money in r&d , increasing the gap in added value with the ukrainian factory . 
  the discourse would change if the latter was to export their bulbs to switzerland and sell them at swiss prices or slightly lower , but that 's not what we are talking about now . 
  nothing against ukraine of course , i just wrote my 2 cents about why using nominal is better than ppp . 
  goes without saying that often the levels of development and standard of living ( and the quality of life above all ) in a country are n't strictly linked to its gdp per capita , especially without taking into account the higher standards this country was used to until some times ago that do not disapper in a few years . 
  looking at median wages , median wealth per capita and comparing it with cost of life is often a better way to measure a country 's standard of living than gdp per capita . 
  a lot of people here use them in whatsapp and i dislike it because the use of voice messages is really abused add to this that my smartphone often gets blocked/bugged when i listen to them . 
  berlusconi , no need to add something else . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/silvio_berlusconi#jokes.2c_gestures.2c_and_blunders ) a brief list . 
  source ? 
  the number for 2015 is 102,259 . 
  anyway you should look at the migration balance . 
   it 's also a good source of memes no maria io escoh, 
  in general rural areas tend to be more right-leaning , but the vote tends to differ on the various provinces rather than the rural areas vs cities . 
  i was joking :p ( even though we do n't actually share a land border ), 
   italy : almost everything , mostly food we are neighbours by right , even though we do n't share a land border !, 
  that could happen in switzerland too :d, 
  what 's up in catalonia ? 
  i 'll reply tomorrow ...

  umbria is the cheaper version of tuscany . 
  still expensive compared to portugal or eastern europe though, 
  ah , then you 'll be fine . 
  they have 500 mbit ( dunno about the outskirts , though ) and 1gbit is in experimentation in the center . 
  overall yes , it 's rather slow , but everything depends on the city you 'll be heading to ; you may as well get 100 mbit in a medium-sized city .
