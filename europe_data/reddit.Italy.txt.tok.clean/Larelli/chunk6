  and lake garda conurbation ( with brescia in lombardy and verona in veneto ) with more than 2kk people . 
  also there are other millions of people living between these big metro areas . 
  inside the well-lighted area in northern italy live more than 20 million people for sure , up to 25 taking in account the areas less lighted, 
  katowice has a cornubation with more than 4kk people, 
  well no . 
  ten years ago you 'd have been right though . 
  it 's just a perception that ranking, 
  the town council in many southern italians communes if often leaked with the regional mafia . 
  a neapolitan judge said that in campania ( naples region ) 35 % of the local politicians is leaked with camorra , the neapolitan mafia . 
  it 's not hard to think that in calabria there is n't a different percentuage , with ndrangheta instead of camorra . 
  often the construction company in charge to realize the project is ruled by a ndragheta 's member , otherwise they propose very low prices to be compeitive against the other honest companies . 
   i assume those numbers are estimates , because i doubt ndrangheta publishes official figures . 
  it 's a report from demoskopika . 
   well , with all their money laundering activities , most of that money does go back in the italian economy ( for example through consumption , investments , some taxes etc. 
  ) , so it accounts for some percentage of gdp . 
  no they do n't . 
  such money are put in the * grey and black market * activities . 
  guess why calabria has ** the equivalent ** of 55 % of its gdp in such activies , when for example lombardy has 14 % , less than the eu average . 
   neither is it in romania or any other corrupt country it is simple bribing . 
  i was n't even referring to your contry . 
  what to say , good for you then . 
  you 're not the one who decides how italy ranks compared to other countries . 
  ndragheta factures $ 53 billions yearly , half of them abroad , 36 billions just from cocaine . 
  anyway , earning the equivalent of is not properly the same as accounting for . 
  what you stated does n't change what i said : it 's not simple bribing . 
  ndragheta has its men as local mayors in a lot of calabrian comunes and they gain not few money from the public contracts , where at least 80 % of the corruption in italy is about . 
  corruption in italy has very little to do with bribing itself . 
  it 's completely another kind of corruption . 
  not simple bribing . 
  on other hand one could argue that a perception index is as useful as a crime perception index . 
  cosa nostra on sicily did , 20 years ago . 
  this is a ** satisfaction ** ranking , not an ** happiness ** one . 
  why using gdp per capita and so on as measures ? 
  a recent poll in italy showed for example that the happiest were the apulians , with lombards being the saddest . 
  that 's about happiness towards everyday 's life ; despite lombardy has twice the gdp per capita of apulia and 1/3 the unemployment rate : money ca n't buy happines . 
  instead , according to the measures used , northern italian regions would rank higher than the southern ones . 
  longer time ? 
  russia was just recovering from the 2009 crisis , before the sanctions and the oil prices made everything worse . 
  http://i.imgur.com/gc3f8do.png prodotti agricoli = agricultural products prodotti alimentari = food products prodotti tessili/abbigliamento e accessori = textiles , clothes and accessories mobili = furnitures auto = cars as you see these embargo ended up ruining a lot of things , not just food products . 
  that 's the il sole 24 ore 's graphics, 
   source ? 
  http://assets.bwbx.io/images/ivzucfhlvacy/v1/-1x-1.jpg russian economy is doing poorly because of the oil prices , as 50 % of their budget comes from oil/gas . 
  the sanctions are n't just on food products . 
  just on food ? 
  yeah if only it was true . 
  our exports with russia fell by more than 20 % before russia got the troubles with the internal crisis ( and do you believe that 20 % came just from food ? 
  ) ; only in emilia romagna more than 1000 factories closed due to these sanctions . 
  some industries had to move their hq to switzerland or turkey ( eheh , before someone shot down a russian plane ) to be able to keep trading with russia . 
  just about food ? 
  for which country ? 
  we export a lot to russia , clothes , machines , jewelry ... a lot of footwear factories here in my province were damaged by these sanctions, 
  well , good for you . 
  if you 're ok with stopping your trade with russia i 'm even happy , do n't pretend everyone is okay with that though . 
  what do you mean ? 
  poland has a lot of trades with russia , the sanctions are going ruin their economy as well . 
  also , i can believe we have a trade deficit with them , we import a lot of natural resources from russia !, 
   for some reason countries like italy , or france complains while their trade with russia is quite little it 's more than $ 40 billions , at least for italy ... 
  economy as total gdp = / = industrial output, 
  do you dislike yourself ? 
  so few people in naples want to get a job ? 
  i thought it was just a stereotype, 
  everyone i know has wa here, 
  no ex communist country has overtaken spain yet , also , gdp per capita does n't imply wealth for the citizens . 
  french , italians , western germans and so on have been collecting wealth since 50s , spaniards and greeks since 70s , eastern countries since 90s . 
  you ca n't catch up the countries collecting wealth for so much time in a few years , but surely what achieved in the past years has been very important for the eastern countries and all seems to say the gap west-east in terms of wealth will get smaller and smaller in the next years and decades . 
  rip . 
  yes , unluckily the places with a lot of tourists have loads of scams/pickpocketing, 
  what happened ? 
  yes but a small part of it, 
  yes , naples has a lot of troubles . 
  no place in europe does worse than southern italy when it comes to employement rate and female employment - naples does n't even have 25 % of female employment . 
  women working is quite unusual in most of southern italy btw . 
  dunno if it 's a cultural thing , but even males have low employement rates , and most of the youngs have to move to northern italy or abroad , and unluckily some of them ends up joining camorra , the neapolitan mafia . 
  yet we should n't forget that 1 person out of 5 employed in campania ( naples region ) has an undeclared job , thing that raises the employment . 
  ca n't find how many people are studying , but i know we have an [ high percentuage of neets ] ( http://noitaliaexplorer.istat.it/stories/2015/xml/accessibility/2/s05i07.png ) , mostly depending on the region . 
  also , [ employment rate ] ( http://scenarieconomici.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/gpg1-508-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy.jpg ) by province . 
  bologna is already quite big , compared to the others . 
  surely having a lot of students , an huge nightlife and troubles with peripheries ( not at the levels bigger cities have ) do n't help . 
  if it comes to cities with a relevant population i 'd say the mid-sized cities in the north-east , such as bologna , padova , trento or trieste . 
  what do you mean ? 
  employment rate , people studying ? 
  well no , canada would be one of the most populated countries and would have the 5th biggest economy , after italy and before spain . 
  well i 'm not anti-euro but italy did n't get any `` last boost '' at all . 
  we grew very little even in 2001-2007 . 
  the last year of serious growth was 2000 , with +3,7 % . 
  there are a ** shitload ** of organizations not involved in politics standing up for the independence of their region , such as s\u00fcd-tiroler freiheit , veneto stato , indipendenza veneta , chiavegato per l'indipedenza , pro lombardia indipendenza , l'indipendenza nuova , gioventura piemont\u00e8isa and many many more but they are followed by few thousands people . 
  there are separitist movements in southern italy as well , mostly * neo-borbonic * ones , and they say that everything was better off when they were under the borbone , and things could n't be worse if they were independent , that they are used by northern italy and kept poor by them , and that northern italian industries use the south as their biggest export market ; or fb page like * sputtanapoli * , page opened by some neapolitans to criticize the fact they 're the laughing stock of italy and always used to make negative comparisons . 
   these numbers are what exactly ? 
  like in 1876 from abruzzo , 93 = ? 
  this mean that 93k people went abroad , from abruzzo , since 1876 to 1900 . 
   what were the reasons for these emigrations ? 
  starvation . 
  the only decent areas of the country were some industrial cities such as turin , genoa and more or less milan and rome . 
  the other areas were agrarian ones and extremely poor . 
  in 50s instead it was due to the willing to get a job or to ensure a better future to the sons . 
  yes , a lot of italians moved to north america during 50s , but some hundreds of thousands . 
  it 's not near the millions over millions of early 1900s . 
  the idea northern league had was simple : everyone on his own . 
  what would have southern italy done without the tens of billions $ northern italy gives them yearly would n't have been a * padania * 's business . 
  i wrote some ideas before :  lower taxes for sure , but that is valid for italy as a whole , northern italy first .
