  surelly getting ride of its criminal groups ( cutting down 20 % of the gdp of those regions ) ; working legally ( a lot of people in southern italy have undeclared jobs , thing that partially reduces their unemployment rates - [ percentuage of workforce working illegaly by region ] ( http://noitaliaexplorer.istat.it/stories/2015/xml/accessibility/2/s16i09.png ) ) , having more entrepreneurial spirit , even though southern italy ca n't be as rich as northern italy because the first one is very far from the core of europe , from germany and france and so on . 
  the peripheries tend to be poorer than the core areas . 
  do you mean if any party sill ask for independence ? 
  northern league does n't do it anymore since some years, 
  ca n't find the datas now but i know unemployment in late 40s was rather high ( there were 2 mln people unemployed , so at least 15 % i guess ) , but it heavily decreased in late 50s , and it was 5 % in 60s , during our economic miracle ( with 8 % yearly gdp growth rate ) which led us from a poor war-ravaged agrarian nation to the 4th world economy in 80s and one of the richest nation in europe . 
  most of the italians abroad [ emigrated ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/emigrazione_italiano_per_regione_1876-1915.svg ) in late 1800s ( mostly from northern italian regions , very poor back once , to south america ) or early 1900s ( this time a lot from southern italy as well , to north america ) . 
  the 50s migration was much more smaller , it interested mostly germany , belgium and switzerland . 
  in germany itself three million italians worked during the 50/60s , even though 80 % of them back home during the miracle economic , which in italy happened a bit late compared to west germany . 
  then , during the 60s , 9 million southern italians moved to northern italy , now the people with southern heritage in northern italy are about 12 millions ( over a 30 mln people population in the northern regions ) . 
  that 's why italy lived the foreign immigration very late compared to the rest of western europe : the workforce the country needed came from southern italy . 
  then do n't follow our mistake . 
  people in 1994 said the same trump supporters are saying today : that he ca n't be corrupt , that there ca n't be any lobby behind him , that he would have run the country as successful as he had run his businesses and so on . 
   i can tell you italy 's system : medium and big sized businesses have `` national contracts '' where wages are discussed between unions the businesses ( usually an entire category , ie metal workers ) . 
  also , a lot of professions have a min and a max amount if compensation . 
  regarding wages proper : there 's just a vague `` reasonable compensation '' enshrined in the law . 
  most of those countries without min mage have much stronger unions then average . 
  quote from a comment above, 
  take it back ! ^ / s, 
  who had to out source to china already did it . 
  the automation wo n't have scaring effects in the next 10 years . 
  lower taxes for sure , but that is valid for italy as a whole , northern italy first .

  and why should they raise ? 
  our unemployment it 's decreasing since 2014 . . there 's no world country with such unemployment rate, 
  i was n't referring to fixing the divide , but fixing the situation in northern italy , thing promised by northern league , such as autonomy and so on . 
  well it 's actually very bad . 
  [ total regional/provincial/comunal spending ] ( http://images2.corriereobjects.it/methode_image/2016/02/01/economia/foto%20economia%20-%20trattate/grafico-0030-kdbb-u43150396728040ych-593x443@corriere-web-sezioni.jpg?v=20160131204624 ) for citizen . 
  well to be honest they 're the only special region with a positive fiscal residue ; even if allowed to keep 90 % of their tax revenue . 
  i wrote northern italian provinces indeed . 
  let 's take vicenza as example : that province has one of the highest percentuage of workforce employed in the secondary sector ( almost 40 % ) in europe , more those industries mostly export to the big german companies , that 's why their unemployment is so low . 
  getting even more in debt to grow ? 
  maybe but we have already got high debt levels . 
  the solution to grow is cutting taxes ( in italy they are among the highest in europe ) and selling public shareholdings imho . 
  exactly , except for the police , judiciary sistem , national laws and few other things . 
  they are the first province by natality rate , because thanks to the fiscal autonomy they could put benefits for mothers ( as well businesses , factories , benefits for unemployed people . . ) . 
  lots of northern italian provinces would * die * to get such independence . 
  will you give them such levels of independence ? 
  watch out , that may not be advantageous for them :d, 
  autonomy does :p, 
  pratically now southern germany has the unemployment rate northern italy had until 8 years ago and northern italy has the rate southern germany had during early 2000s crisis . 
  no minimum wage, 
  well no . 
  in italy loads of people have a lot of savings but they spend as little as possible because people still fear the future . 
  yes , and that was the main reason for the independence . 
  [ primary surplus ] ( http://www.lozzodicadore.eu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/rfr-perc-su-pil.png ) as % of gdp for region . 
  italy itself has the highest primary surplus in the eu together with germany , but we 're always in deficit due to the debt interests . 
  * ' o sole, 
  well unemployment rate reached 13.2 % two years ago , now it 's decreasing . 
  at most south tyrol , i.e. 
  they are just 500k people and are fine with the current situation : they are allowed to keep 90 % of their tax revenue , thing that permitted them to avoid a serious increase in unemployment . 
  in 90s , northern league , asking for the independence of * padania * ( northern italy + central italy except lazio and abruzzo ) entered the central parliament , using slogans [ like this ] ( http://dolo.leganord.org/style/images/2005/12.jpg ) attacking rome and southern italian regions ; but after having ruled italy with berlusconi and actually having done nothing to fix the situation , together with some scandals , led umberto bossi to resign and matteo salvini to become secretary , and recently he turned the party into the bad copy of french fn , entering southern italian politics with `` us with salvini '' and now they changed their * public enemy * from southern italians and rome 's politicians to mena migrants and roma people . 
  paradoxically now there is no relevant party asking for indepedence of northern italy ; one would think the crisis had made the separatist movement stronger instead . 
  made by me on istat datas . 
  inflation is n't always bad and deflation is n't always good either . 
  having a ** fair ** inflation is good . 
  there 's a little but important difference between having a 2 % inflation ( now it 's 0,1 % or something ) and spending $ 10000 for some bread ; that 's the actual and scaring inflation . 
  where have you travelled , if i may ask ? 
   the italians are possibility , but realistically they 're far too poor and corrupt have you got the slightest idea about what you 're talking about or have you connected your brain with fox news ? 
  it 's inconceivable , you do n't even deserve a fully answer . 
  open a book sometimes . 
  southern spain for sure, 
  probably not italy as a whole but insubria/lombardy , italian swiss are lombards after all . 
  why has brussels such an high unemployment rate ? 
  a lot of foreign people unemployed ? 
  finally france got decent cheese , then !, 
  well , wikipedia is not the bible . 
  my bedroom is pretty new so it still smells of * new thing * . 
  when i open the window there is the fruit plants smell from my garden . 
  then some days a week i smell the sweet smell from a sugar mill which is some kms from my home . 
  yeah , but that 's actually getting serious . 
  we do n't enjoy a decent growth since 2000 , when we did +3,7 % ( like you now ) and 2006 when we did +2 % . 
  good old times were the 60s , +8 % / year i miss you even if i 've never known you ... 
  did france anschluss sardinia ? 
  breakfast : 7 am lunch : 2 pm because i get home late during the week , otherwise 1pm dinner : 8pm, 
  exactly . 
  one of the main reasons for the italian poor results in the wws was that many soldiers from northern italy could n't understand the ones from the southern regions , because the majority of people did n't even know standard italian , which is very similar to tuscan dialect . 
  usually even at home , with their relatives or friends most of italians keep talking in their own dialect or using expressions from it . 
  map of our dialects : [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/italy_-_forms_of_dialect.jpg ) and [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://static.fanpage.it.s3.amazonaws.com/scienzefanpage/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/dialetti-italiani.png ) . 
  a naval blockade for hundreds and hundreds of kms of costline ? 
  and if a boat full of women and child ignores it , what do you do then ? 
  do you torpedo it ? 
  italian government in 1997 did a naval blockade towards albania to reduce the flux of albanian migrants ( it was only some tens kms of costline ) ; an albanian boat ignored it and an italian navy frigate rammed into it , 120 migrants died and we had to stop straightaway the block . 
  it 's not that simple , or maybe it is for a country with no sea access, 
  yeah , they could create an unique region with south tyrol and would be allowed to keep 90 % of their taxes , i do n't think they 'd dislike it :p, 
  exactly . 
  i do n't see why we should ruin the trades between our countries and the link between tyrol and south tyrol for a possibility that is not even happening now . 
  yes , i know . 
  [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/biasuttimappa.gif ) shows the frequence of blonde hairs : sardinia and calabria are the darkest , north-central italians do n't look that different from the ones in centre-south , while the ones living northern than milan and under the alps looks quite similar to swiss or austrians . 
  i can understand you but securing tyrol to screw south tyrol is not a solution either . 
  we need to fix the problems to the roots . 
  if a tree is firing you do n't throw water at the branches . 
  also , the economic disadvantages ( for us , the germans and you ) of such policy delete the benefits you would get, 
  you take it and we 'll delete your debt in 5 years !, 
  you can take southern italy back for free when you want ^ / s, 
  good boys , close the borders because you fear some migrants . 
  the brenner pass is crossed everyday by almost 6k heavy trucks , it 's the main ruote of german-italian trades and you import a lot of things from us as well , have fun with hours and hours of queues . 
  where do you import your diesel from ? 
  who is your 2nd economic partner ? 
  italy .
