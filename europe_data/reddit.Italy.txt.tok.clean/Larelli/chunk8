  also , if they want to get to austria they will go through the forests , exactly what happened the last year with france : they closed the streets and the migrants kept going there through the mountains . 
  they are in the southern periphery of milan , but many cities in italy have such buildings in their peripheries , especially the big northern cities : those * commieblocks * were built in the 60s-70s to host the huge numbers of migrants from the southern regions , like the [ biscione ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/biscione_dal_basso.jpg ) in genoa . 
  now they are mostly inhabited by foreign migrants, 
  italians from the north-west , north-east , tuscany , central italy , southern regions or sicily ? 
  i know but it 's a possibility . 
  there must be a debate , but at the end real decisions have to be taken . 
  if someone does n't want to respect them , he ca n't think to remain in the eu and above all keep taking money . 
  scampia ( and secondigliano ) have an * official * 65 % unemployment rate , afaik . 
  they have n't to do anything for us , they are just supposed to follow eu common choices , but some of those countries do n't even want to follow them, 
  or just kick them from the eu . 
  anyway ,  government shipping their tax money to poorer countries in southern europe as italy is considered southern europe , you 're talking of us as well ; then , i 'm going to ask you : when troika/ecb bailed us out and how much money were used . 
  also , letting alone greece only spain and portugal were bailed out . 
  and i did n't notice there were troubles with the refund . 
  poorer countries ? 
  yes italy is poor indeed lol . 
  you and your comrade above should get real infos from the right places . 
  italy is the 3rd net contributor to the eu . 
  italy is the third net contributor to the eu . 
  could you tell me the day ( and month and year as well ) , the amount of money anyone gave italy or is it just the daily bs from the usual misinformation festival ? 
  also , italy has the 3rd highest trade surplus in the eu as well . 
  to be honest i think the autonomous italian regions have far less power than an us state . 
  sure , they can keep/get a lot of money ( south tyrol keeps 90 % of their tax revenue , sicily keeps it all more they get another 50 % , more or less , of their tax revenue ) , but they do n't have judiciary autonomy , their own police and so on edit : spell, 
  implying isis is going to win and destroy the western world . 
  would you really shoot at boats with humans in ? 
  for almost everyone . 
  dictatorship is a dictatorship , it 's just a bad thing . 
  you 're right here and i know . 
  yet we do n't have other believable alternatives for libya . 
  so , despite ghaddafi remains bad , he 's anyway the * lesser evil * . 
  the alternative , nowadays , is the anarchy of the countless military groups or even worse isis taking control of the whole country . 
  i wish libya had become a successful democracy like tunisia , but we did n't help to stabilize them ( as eu/nato ) and we see the current results . 
  that 's not about electricity , there 's a war in libya and isis is conquering ground every day . 
  surely , for how much bad ghaddafi could be , his dictatorship was for sure better for libya , for us and the libyans than the current shape of that country . 
  not that nowadays italy sucks but surely 30 years ago it was at the top in the world ( 4th biggest economy in the world , gdp per capita higher than west germany , 8th nation in the world where to live in according to economist ) ... while now , with the weight of the crisis as well , italy has declined compared to 20 years ago . 
  ghaddafi , as we say in italy , was the lesser evil . 
  libya had to be helped to get a functional democracy , the only arab country which succeeded was tunisia . 
  surely ghaddafi 's dicatorship was better than the current shape . 
  high taxes , crazy red tape , high debt and , recently , poor internal demand causing slow growth , part of the tax fraud , relatively high levels of unemployment ruining an overall quite good economy 2 . 
  corruption ( not bribing , the corruption here is mostly in the public works and public contracts ) and low quality of politicians , above all the ones in the central government and in some local administrations 3 . 
  north-south divide and troubles with southern italy, 
  it does . 
  it tells us the socioeconomic profile of a province/region/area . 
  southern germany along with switzerland enjoys the [ highest employment rate in the eu ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a5sllyl.png ) , at 80 % . 
  if we talk about the culture , bavaria seems to have the same [ indivualism rate ] ( https://hbdchick.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/individualism-map-2-hajnal-line.jpg ) as eastern germany , i do n't think it 's a cultural difference , but just 50 years of communism . 
  no place in eu does worse than southern italy , with a barely 40 % employment : this an disconcerting thing , also in some provinces female empoyment does n't reach 25 % , while being 65 % in some northern provinces . 
  [ unemployment rate in the italian regions ] ( http://www.telemia.it/public/foto/7649news.jpg ) . 
  that 's the 2014 rank , more or less unemployment fell 0,5 % everywhere since . 
  even though that 's not a nice result for anyone , considering the northern italian regions had 2 % unemployment ( and 8-9 % youth one ) , and the southern ones had 11-12 % unemployment ( still high , but at * human levels * ) , until 7 years ago . 
  it becomes even much more worrying when analyzing the [ employment rate ] ( http://scenarieconomici.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/gpg1-508-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy-copy.jpg ) for province . 
  what kind of food were you trying to import and from where , if i may ask ? 
  your points have nothing to do with the argument thesunisgone was making . 
  tell me one country ( one country ) who can stand a 69 % taxation over smes , the bedrock of italy , without having an huge grey market ( letting alone that northern italy is under the eu average for tax fraud ) black market ? 
  it implies illegal purchases . 
  i do n't see why in italy where the heavy drugs use is not high the black market should be big . 
  where do you build your argument on about corruption ? 
  using * perceptions * or have you got more actual proofs ? 
  i myself admit that southern italy has a big problem with corruption , but * perceptions * do n't make anyone right . 
  rip, 
  well , good for you, 
  actually munich ( only the city itself ) is a bit higher than frankfurt . 
  hamburg is `` just '' 205 . 
  or novi . 
  in 2013 one was at 57 % of the eu average and one at 61 % if i remember well, 
  there are two nuts-2 regions in croatia indeed, 
  michele ferrero is dead and nutella is just a product manufactured by [ ferrero spa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferrero_spa ) . 
  i can understand you . . 
  i found [ this map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iipuees.gif?1 ) , i though southern italy was the worst , well , you are in a sad situation : / imho you should fire a lot of people ( i know , unemployment would skyrocket ) and use as more money as possible to cut taxes and help factories and small businesses in order to make an economy recovery and reduce unemployment . 
  in southern italy they had a similar situation : being a poor area a lot of people were unemployed so the local politicians employed them as statal workers and in exchange these people would have voted for them at the next elections . 
  in your dreams . 
  here in italy ( at least in my region ) nearly always the bricklayers are albanians , so yes you do mostly physical works . 
  the integration is pretty good , i myself have some albanian friends and have never had problems with them . 
  nothing bad to say . 
  i know you 're one of the poorest in europe even due to the isolationist policy hoxha started in the 70s but in the last years you 've been growing very fast and your unemployment decreased . 
  according to eurostat it 's wolfsburg , but gdp ppp = / = purchase power . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.gfk-geomarketing.com/fileadmin/gfkgeomarketing/en/img/press/201401_mom.jpg ) is the map of purchase power in germany , munich area has the highest purchase power, 
  deindustrialisation is our biggest risk in the short-medium term , let 's hope that in the next months the trend will improve after the partial and small recovery of the last year . 
  selling national companies and properties is good imho ( yes , i 'm quite liberalistic ) . 
  if you are referring to the brands ( star , lamborghini , italcementi , pirelli and many more ) i agree with you , it 's actually a pity losing to foreign hands our best brands , yet it 's better to sell , rather than close . 
  helding the debt inside the country does n't help at all if you default , it does only before , when you 're renegotiating the debt with your creditors . 
   and that would have magically materialized the money to pay for greek pensions and public workers salaries how ? 
  of course , it would n't . 
  i 'm just saying that greece would have let default . 
  it would n't have paid back its debt . 
  letting alone that greece has a crazy ratio of statal workers , even worse than the one we have in calabria or sicily . 
  but noone would have ordered greece what to do . 
  i 'm not denying at all that having a 135 % of gdp debt is bad , but the fact that most of the debt is held inside the country is a * softening * thing for sure , unless you default ( when you 're died pratically , and luckily we managed to avoid a default risk in 2011/2012 , our two worst years since the wwii , together with 1977/78 ) . 
  i 've checked , and frankfurt area is actually [ the richest in germany ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mvvjsjx.png ) if we let alone provinces like wolfsburg and ingolstadt * drugged * by vw , audi and so on . 
  are you implying that anyone would have n't been allowed to buy greeks bonds or just that in 2009 100 % of the debt was held inside the country ? 
  greece could have cut the debt or delay the payment if noone inside or outside the country would have bough some bonds . 
  but it 'd not have been in noone 's interests to save greece , then troika would have never saved it if its debt was entirely a domestic one . 
  the german/french banks ( which held it ) would have got screwed , so pratically what eu did was replacing banks ' debt with taxpayers ' debt . 
  look at japan : they 're still one of the best country in the world . 
  would they have kept their standards of life it their debt ( issued at low rates ) was in foreign hands and also they were in crazy deficit with rising unemployement ? 
  also , this `` japanificazation '' of italy will have risks in a medium-long term , i actually do n't see any risk of italy failing in the next 2 years , if we survived 2011 . 
  imf projections . 
  yes , i remember we had to build their first highway for free as exchange to the block of the migrants . 
   how does that help ? 
  it helps because no foreign country can blackmail the government , unlike what has been done with greece . 
  if japan has managed to survive with such an high debt that 's why it 's almost entirely held inside the country , like ours . 
  the debt is n't going to increase that much in the coming years .
