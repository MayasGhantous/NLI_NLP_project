wait . 
  the us does n't have legal abortion ? 
  what the fuck ? 
   high quality comment . 
  now now let 's not exaggerate, 
  so lets just kill every single muslim since a bunch of crazed dudes are doing this shit , am i right ? . 
  do you realize how easy it is to do these kind of attacks ? 
  literally me or you could do it . 
  this bunch of terrorist must be dealt with without destroying the lives or millions of others ( because we 're talking about millions here ), 
  dude he 's american , he knows shit better than you / s, 
  so what do you suggest we should do ? 
  edit : thanks for the downvotes , i 'm just asking his opinion on the matter . 
  yea he said that her ass is too big, 
  us left maybe . 
  speak for yourself . 
  they did n't cut your dick at 12 yrs old am i right ? 
  months of healing , loss of sensibility , erectile dysfunctions , premature ejaculation ( or the reverse ) ... we have plenty for it . 
  dont bother , / r/t _ d is here, 
  2nd or third language for him , keep it in mind my fellow mono language < 3, 
  haha yea me too 33 is . . really high . 
  ^ ^ help ^ ^ us ^ ^ please, 
  in the summer yes , but i take one shower in the morning and one in the evening when it 's 35 +, 
  numbers are wrong , italians speak 2 languages ? 
  it 's more likely that 1.9 % of the italians speak english, 
  holy shit . 
  first of all , i live in den haag , not amsterdam . 
  do n't assume things about random people on the internet unless you 're sure you 're lying to yourself if you seriously believe that dutch people do n't speak english . 
  i do n't know dutch ( yet , i 'm learning it ) and i literally have 0 problems , i legitimately never encountered someone that can not at least do a basic conversation in english . 
  even the friendly grandma managed to spurt a `` oh ok . . it 's very hot today , are n't you hot ? '', 
  when she saw me yesterday with black long jeans and white shirt at the tram station in bierkade , after trying to talk in dutch  retty sure 99 % of ethnic dutch ( about 80 % according to wikpedia ) speak just dutch and ugly accented english hahahahahhahahahahahha . 
  just not true . 
  have plenty of dutch friends ( before you start shouting shit , i do n't have any italian friend here apart from my best one that made me come here ) , and they all speak english . 
  and no , they 're not redditors nor gamers . 
  they 're normal people with all kinds of education , from vmbo to bachelors . 
  also , as a non native english speaker it 's far easier to understand swedish / dutch / danish / finnish people speaking english than real englishmen , it sounds ugly to you because you can recognize dutch accent . 
  it literally happens 20 times per day when people talk to me in dutch , i asnwer with an `` excuse me , i do n't speak dutch very well '' and then we keep talking about whatever the fuck we had to talk about . 
  i never had an episode of someone cutting the conversation because they do n't know english . 
  are there people that do n't know english ? 
  i 'm sure of it . 
  the turkish lady near my house does n't . 
  also something must be wrong with your brain , considering all the insults that you managed to make after one `` are you high ? '' . 
  fuck off with that shit , this subreddit is n't for you . 
  edit : fixed a bit of grammar but i 'm on mobile and about to get a stroke because of it edit2 : by the way http://www.ef.nl/epi/ there are dozens of rankings and nl is the 1st in every single on of them . 
  netherlands is literally the best country in the world that does n't have english as an official language and yet you call me insane xd, 
  everyone in nl speaks english , are you high or something ? 
  always on the top of our game , way to go italy ayyyy / s, 
  there 's a difference between opinions and facts . 
  europe is not under martial law , and there is n't a mass murder of europeans going on . 
  you can say that terrorists attacks are n't gon na decrease because muslims do n't want to integrate ( and would n't agree with you ) and we can debate about it . 
  disregarding facts and statistics is just dumb . 
  it 's the same when people say us is n't the strongest economy in the world . 
  bullshit is bullshit no matter if you 're agreeing or not with me, 
  ayyylmao, 
  no , no one wants to argue with him because we literally deal with idiots saying this exact same shit every single day mutiple times per day on every fucking sub getting pretty tired , someone should do a general post and repost it every time . 
  like the dude that explained why sweden has high % of rape . 
  oh you so you want counter arguments ? 
  ok .  i hope you guys are still a recognizable civilization within 50 years and do n't look like baghdad , although wth the importation of millions from that part of the world , you are well on your way , and you all seem to be super happy about it !, 
  i do n't know man , i 'm in nl right now , a country with 20 % + of immigrants , a small percentage from europe and the rest from the rest of the world . 
  pretty nice here , [ one of the best countries to live in according to the hdi stats ] ( http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/hdi )  just hope you 're happy with watching your countrymen die and your children die at the hands of `` diversity '' . 
  poland and hungary do n't let refugees into their countries and their police do n't walk their streets in full battle rattle gear with automatic rifles like the police in the western nations , i bet quasi martial law feels amazing right ? 
  hahahhahahahahah i 'm italian and the only place in rome where there are soldiers is colosseo , aka the 2nd most visited monument in the world , with 30k + visitors daily . 
  in nl police goes around with fucking bicycles , cause i do n't have to be scared that someone may shoot me for no fucking reason like a well known state [ europe + russia and other countries homicide rate , did n't manage to remove the non eu ones from the pdf ] ( https://data.unodc.org/sys/rpt?reportfile=crime-statistics-homicide-count-data&amp;region=europe&amp;region__label=europe&amp;subregion=__all&amp;subregion__label=all&amp;country=__all&amp;country__label=all+%2844%29&amp;format=pdf&amp;fullscreen=true&amp;showtoc=true#state:0 ) [ united states homicide rate ] ( https://data.unodc.org/sys/rpt?reportfile=crime-statistics-homicide-count-data&amp;region=americas&amp;region__label=americas&amp;subregion=northern%20america&amp;subregion__label=northern+america&amp;country=230&amp;country__label=united+states%20of%20america&amp;format=pdf&amp;fullscreen=true&amp;showtoc=true#state:0 ) wait wait did i read it right ? 
  us homicide rate is more than 4 times of the evil islamist merkel reign , 4 times than the rapefugee capital of the world , and 3 times of the surrendering frogs ?? 
  but it doesnt fit what trump told you !, 
  did he * lie * to you ? 
  europe is n't getting bred out nor killed nor anything else ? 
  in fact we 're mostly fine ?? 
  we can count our terrorists attacks in the last years on our hands ( and it should be 0 ) , i wonder if you can do the same with mass shootings . 
  time to kick out every ~ ~ american gun owner ~ ~ muslim i guess . 
   jesus lord almighty , rise from your knees , europe . 
  stop giving in to the false song of globalism . 
  i 'm so sorry to watch you all surrender your civilization and the progress that you 've made in the last thousand years . 
  it 's so sad . 
  jesus is out of fashion here in eu , we only have allahu / s edit : also i 'm sure that you 've never seen a muslim a moroccan or a syrian in your life . 
  stupid uneducated fucks edit2 grammar, 
  i did !, 
  in nl right ( not to be a pot head btw i know the stereotype ) i really trust merkel and macron , the fact that he got elected with sucha big % gave me a bit of hope . 
  also the fact that m5s is losing a tiny bit of ground in italy, 
  i should specify that i am from southern italy , the situation is completely different in the north, 
  i cant say the same for italy , but i 'm pretty optistimic about europe in general . 
  when you move you 'll realize how bad italy is . 
  it 's not even comparable in any way, 
  i agree . 
  the problem is that a good % of millennials are expatriating . 
  if the good brains get out it 's gon na be a big problem . 
  i 'm really worried, 
  it will get worse . 
  the younger population in their 20 's are all getting the fuck out of here . 
  literally in masses . 
  there 's an exodus to nl and germany, 
  it 's a us thing . 
  we do n't go by race but by nationality ( apart from the old farts and the uneducated ), 
  i do n't know why either actually , i do n't think i really want to know, 
  amsterdam is a nightmare . 
  tried to move there but i just could n't stand it ( in den haag rn ), 
  god i smoke once a month ( maybe ) and this makes me feel like a pothead :(, 
  is it really frowned upon ? 
  did n't know that . 
  i guess that 's why my dutch friends never smoke or talk about it ( i 'm in den haag ), 
  and ford fiesta edit : til i do n't know shit about cars,
