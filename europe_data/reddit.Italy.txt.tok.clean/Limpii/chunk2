  sorry if we follow what eu says . 
  or do you want us to do what the fuck we want like greece and cutting in half our contribution to eu ? 
  honestly do n't understand what the fuck brussels wants sometimes, 
  castelluccio does n't exist anymore , sadly, 
  why are you theyy hating on you ? 
  it 's made to look real, 
  well he was a dictator afterall what did you expect :p mafia actually took a hard blow during fascism but was never completely eradicated, 
  mafia / other criminal organizations never left, 
  carcassone is something else . 
  i 've been there two times and it always makes me hold my breath . 
  you 're in the highway , make a little turn and ... bam . 
  carcassone in all it 's beauty . 
  awesome i liked it inside too , it 's really cute when the sun is about to go down, 
  south europe weather is doing some work is n't it, 
  kill the fucking pharah pls, 
  wow . 
  they 're the same because they 're both in black and white / s, 
  holy crap what a plot twist, 
  yea same i have no clue what paizuri is i swear, 
  i 'm about to move to leiden :( how 's the life there for shortys like us ? 
  i asked nl subreddit and received good answers but i 've got a bad feeling about that, 
  i 'm 21 . 
  as a 170 cm man this hit a little too close home :(, 
  hey i lived there when i was young !, 
  glad to see my little city on reddit < 3, 
  in italian it 's `` l'aia '' do n't ask me why, 
  a 4th generation chinese immigrant is n't any different than a 4th generation german immigrant . 
  they 're americans . 
  do not overlap skin colour and culture . 
  it 's true that us has probably the most `` racially diverse '' , but to say that it 's culturally diverse is a big big stretch . 
  in europe we have places where you speak a different * language * ( not accent nor slang ) from the rest of the country . 
  i 've been three times in the states , and there 's little difference between chicago and san francisco . 
  the buildings are a little different , sure , and i believe there are big differences in politics etc , but in the end it 's still america . 
  it 's not a different country like nl and italy , it 's more like the difference between north italy and the south ( actually it 's not since italian situation is really peculiar but w/e i think i got the point across ) an italian american is n't italian . 
  he 's a delusional american that thinks he has some cultural connections to italy because of his great grandfather . 
  my grandfather is from argentina but i do n't feel any connection to buenos aires , in the end why should i ? 
  smth `` the us is the most diverse country on earth '' smth, 
  username does n't fit at all, 
  scrooge mcduck likes this post, 
  like it or not religion ( catholic protestant etc etc ) are part of european culture . 
  you 're gon na kick vatican city out of europe ? 
  same thing for italy , self-deprecation is a national sport over here must be a family thing, 
  i know you 're being sarcastic but this is / r/shitamericanssay worthy, 
  impossible . 
  66 % of the italians know another language ? 
  complete bullshit , saying `` i know english '' does n't mean speaking it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazism literally the first 20 words the nazists are the members , not the nazism . 
  you 're right that 's why nazists and fascists do n't exist anymore in germany nor in italy am i right ? 
  what a funny guy . 
  pnf does n't exist anymore and we have the granddaughter of mussolini in the senate . 
  would you say she 's not a fascists because the pnf does n't exist ? 
  or that the beet guys are n't nazists because nsdap was disbanded after ww2 ? 
  nazism and fascism are first an ideology and then a party, 
  are you playing dumb or what ? 
  you were basicly forced to join the parties if you wanted to survive , especially in cities . 
  you do n't seem to get that being a part of the nsdap does n't mean actually believe in the nazism principles . 
  we use nazi as a word to describe people with a certain ideology , not necessarly members of a nazist party . 
  that because in the past people were forced to be members for example , there 's a nazist organization in belgium named beet : those are true nazist , because they joined the movement out of their own will . 
  they share the nazist ideology , and therefore are `` more nazist '' than the average 1941 german confectioner , which may or may not share their ideology , due to him being forced to join the party . 
  sigh . 
  [ this one , some comments are ... 
  debatable . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67esbb/today_in_italy_we_celebrate_the_liberation_from/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=europe ), 
  this is not the case . 
  both the nsdap and the pnf required a party membership in order to get most jobs , and the youth was forced to do too ( not sure about the ndsap youth to be honest ) under a dictatorhip/totalitarianism being a member of a party does n't mean sharing the ideology of it, 
  a supporter of the nazism ideology wants that , what the fuck ? 
  if you do n't share that then you 're not a nazist, 
  if you 're a nazist whose objective is to eliminate jews , homosexual , disabled people etc. 
  from the face of the earth then yes , you 're a bad human being, 
  it 's obvious then when we bash facists and nazist we bash true supporters , not random people that lived under the regime, 
  same day as italy , what a coincidence let 's see if this thread gets as much hate as the other one . 
  of course he had supporters at the beginning , what the fuck . 
  he lost them during the war when italy started losing people were tired of the war and wanted a democracy after years of death and destruction . 
  that 's what we celebrate . 
  we celebrate the liberation from nazifascism which was the last iteration of fascism power in italy . 
  if mussolini had maintaned power right until the allies liberation we would celebrate the fall of fascism . 
  history took another turn and we celebrate the fall of nazifascism unfortunately everyone is in the senate in italy . 
  we are a deeply corrupted nation after all i mean we have razzi in the senate which is a kim jong un supporter [ translation of the link : `` kim jong-un is n't a dictator , there 's more democracy there than in renzi 's italy '' ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2016/05/06/razzi-corea-del-nord_n_9857348.html ) edit : spelling, 
  what, 
  repubblica online is shit do not take any information from it, 
  right has always been a thing in europe dude . 
  have you seen the last 10 years of politics or not ? 
  of course the right has risen a bit with the immigration crisis , is this something that was not expected ? 
  le pen supporter , just ignore him, 
  looks like you are n't providing any source either . 
  germany culture is n't nazism . 
  not every country has 100 years of history like usa my friend, 
  no money for a child after degree . 
  not even for yourself actually, 
  it 's funny , you 're getting downvoted sbecause it 's us reddit time, 
  no in theory, 
  ignorant italians think like that . 
  it 's hard to find them on reddit tho . 
  i 'd say that this map is more directed to make fun of ourselves and what we think than to poke fun at you guys , shitty map overall love and peace , loved bucarest, 
  you 're just making shit up , cat eaters is a chinese stereotype we only spaghetti and pizza here , 24/24, 
  yea but italy living costs are n't low , they 're about the same as germany i think ( which obviously is n't as expensive as uk but not as cheap as eatern europe either ) [ italy vs croatia comparison ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=croatia&amp;country2=italy ) [ italy vs germany comparison ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=germany&amp;country2=italy ) obviously these are n't totally accurate but they should give a rough idea, 
  i post there quite frequently , always trying to give them a hand to escape the toxic loophole that is that sub . 
  consider that most of them are young guys in a teenage crisis that cant get laid / get a woman . 
  they consider themselves the bottom of human society because they 're ugly , i do n't think they 're evil ( sure , some posts are fucked up , but there are crazies everywhere anyway ) , they just need someone to show them that the world is n't that much of a shitty place as they believe it is, 
  no , because it 's better to live with mama until 30 than using half your pay for a single room in a 5 men apartment the average young italian with a degree does n't gain more than 900 euro per month,
