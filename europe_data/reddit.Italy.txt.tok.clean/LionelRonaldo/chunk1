found [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lndehlnx6wg ) interview he gave at the italian television . 
  roughly translated : `` we 're going to respect the 3 % limit , not everybody does but that does not mean that other countries have the right to decide over france or other nations , in other words , to be more clear : we respect the 3 % limit but we respect also the decisions of a free and friendly country like france and i believe that nobody has the right to treat other countries in the way they treat students . 
  if france has made this decision they have their reasons and i 'm with fran\u00e7ois hollande and manuel valls , naturally italy 's situation is different and we 're going to respect the 3 % limit that we 've been imposed . '',

  good news from malta !, 
  now my country is the only one left in western europe that has still to legalize it , what a shame . 
  interesting video , but they 've made a small geographical mistake : carrara is not on the adriatic ( east ) coast but on the thyrrenian ( west ) one . 
  it is indeed . 
  but , at least over here , it 's not caused by the eu rather than by local politicians and bureaucrats , who are often corrupt . 
  as crazy as it might sound , a more centralized eu governance would help in solving the problem , by taking away the decision-making power from the hands of the corrupt people . 
  it was ( at least politically ) in the 1940s though , morocco and algeria were still french territories . 
  i think it 's not unethical if you 're really interested in that country 's politics ; if i moved to another country i would still vote in italian elections . 
  on the other hand , if you do n't really care enough to be informed it 's better that you do n't vote . 
  lack of money and housing cost are important factors , but another concern is lack of stability ; in the past here a lot of jobs were basically `` life-lasting '' , nowadays many people work for a while in a place then their work contract is n't renewed and have to find another job somewhere else , in another town or even in another country . 
  in these conditions it 's impossible to plan in advance so a lot of people just prefer to not have kids . 
  yes , around 80.000 people [ according to wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/griko_people ) . 
  i do n't know if a greek person would consider them to be greek though , they mixed a lot with southern italians over the course of time . 
  this is an interesting post . 
  while i 'm a huge supporter of unrestricted immigration ( for selfish reasons , too : i want to be able to move wherever i like ) i agree that assimilation into the new culture is a crucial point . 
  especially in regard to sharing the `` western '' ideals of freedom and tolerance . 
  having said that , i think assimilation is a combined effort : the immigrant must do everything in his power to adapt but he should be put in the condition to do so . 
  a possible solution might be to force immigrants to take free language courses which also teach the culture and values of that specific country , and periodically test them ; those who fail the test would then be expelled . 
  do n't know know if that 's feasible but selective immigration sounds more rational than `` everybody is welcome '' or `` keep them all out '' . 
  ultimately i agree with that redditor that wrote that this subject should be dealt with from a `` centrist '' point of view , leaving all ideologies aside . 
  i was n't expecting this result to be honest . 
  i 'm disappointed .

  very funny :d sorry for not including many countries in the list , these were the first that came into my mind . 
  thanks for the reply !, 
  i 'll give them a listen . 
  i do n't know any wines that might be contaminated , but the famous `` buffalo mozzarella cheese '' is produced in that area . 
  i really liked toundra !, 
  are there other spanish bands that play a similar style ? 
  i 'm not an expert on my country 's music , anyway here are some rock bands that sing in italian .

  many people i know are against the euro , their argument being `` with the lira i could buy more stuff '' . 
  they might be right , but i think that quitting the euro right now would do more harm than good . 
  sound strange to me , because the aspirated c should be only between two vowels . 
  so we 'd still say for example `` un cane '' but we would say `` una hasa '' . 
  anyway i live on the coast so it 's entirely possible that the accent varies a bit . 
  true , it 's mostly accent and pronunciation though , and the usage of some words that are n't used anymore in standard italian . 
  while northern and southern dialects are much more different and almost incomprehensible to someone who only speaks the standard language . 
  my regional dialect * is * my country 's official language . 
  i live in tuscany , italy . 
  here in italy we have many immigrants , mainly from eastern europe ( especially romania ) and north africa , due to geographical proximity . 
  the attitude towars them is mixed , usually old people are quite xenophobic while young people are more accepting , however due to the economic crisis people are starting to feel resentment because they think that immigrants took all our jobs . 
  romanians are unjustly hated because some ignorant folks tend to confuse them with the romani gypsies ( who are the minority most difficult to integrate ) . 
  overall i 'd say immigrants here are more or less integrated and most do some low paid job that italians do n't really want to do . 
  sure , there are also a few criminals but it 's just the usual crimes ( drug dealing , theft ) and not serious stuff like rioting/religious fundamentalism/terrorism . 
  i think my country is still safe from this point of view . 
  indeed . 
  also , from one of the captions :  frankfurt 's mayor , peter feldmann , has called for all of frankfurt 's construction sites to allow graffiti on their perimeter fences . 
  we need more mayors like him . 
  in the latest local elections the independentist candidate got only about 3 % of the votes though . 
  it 's pretty much a fringe movement , nothing like catalonia for example . 
  `` we 're all tired we want our documents/papers '' with lots of grammar and spelling mistakes . 
  the sea inside ( spain ) is probably my favourite ; other good films not yet mentioned in the thread : black book ( netherlands ) , last year at marienbad ( france ) , the turin horse ( hungary ) . 
  it would take many years but we 'll inevitably get there . 
  italy , spain and portugal are drinking and watching the football game on tv , wondering how will they pay the bill because none of them have money . 
  they 'll probably ask for credit saying that they 'll pay the next time . 
  greece is already drunk with ouzo at the start of the night and the owner ( germany ) threatens to kick him if he continues drinking . 
  france is at the counter , trying to order his drink in french instead of english and then gets mad at the bartender who does n't serve him . 
  belgium is at his side still undecided on what to order . 
  uk is always complaining that the bar is shitty , the other patrons are dickheads and the drinks suck , but in the end he always stays until bar closes being friendly with everyone . 
  poland and ireland just met and they 've instantly become best friends . 
  bulgaria and romania are outside the bar , pissed that the bouncer ( netherlands ) does n't let them in . 
  romania then decides to go to visit his friend moldova instead . 
  the balkan countries are loudly arguing with each other , except slovenia that left their table and went to sit with austria , czech and slovakia , pretending not to know his former friends . 
  estonia wants to talk with her crush finland , but he 's more interested in chatting up sweden and denmark , so she goes back to the table with lithuania and latvia . 
  luxembourg is dressed like a hipster and is drinking an unknown craft beer . 
  andorra , liechtenstein , monaco , gibraltar and san marino are underage and ca n't drink so they order a coke . 
  malta and cyprus just entered the bar but nobody noticed them . 
  turkey is very religious and does n't go to bars , while iceland lives too far away and rarely shows up . 
  russia keeps drinking vodka from ukraine 's glass , the other patrons are irritated by his behaviour but nobody has the balls to do anything to stop him , so russia continues to harass ukraine . 
  switzerland and norway do n't like the atmosphere of the bar , but they still want to drink , so they buy a bottle of the most expensive wine and then drink it outside . 
  - czech republic : the wealthier ex-communist country , high standard of living , great geographical location right in the heart of europe , and prague is a lovely city . 
  also cheap beer . 
  - romania : similar language and fast internet , plus my gf is from there . 
  - estonia : from what i 've read looks like the country is modernizing very fast and catching up with western europe , and tallinn looks a very nice city . 
  your ghettos look better than many residential areas here . 
   about the way people see the world , religion , work , politics , morals ... etc. 
  i agree but those are individual choices that do n't depend on nationality or ethnicity . 
  you could probably find that you have more in common with someone from the other side of the world who shares your mentality and political beliefs than with your neighbours or the people you 've grown up with . 
  i disagree with the other posters , the town of venice is quite liberal compared to the rest of the country and up until now has always had a centre-left government . 
  it 's the countryside that is conservative . 
  the venetian separatist movement is almost non-existant , the indipendentist candidate got like 3 % of the votes in the latest regional elections . 
  the problem with the daily mail is not that it 's right-wing , is that it 's sensasionalist low quality journalism . 
  the telegraph , for example , has a conservative slant but it 's a way more reputable news source in my opinion .
