  noooo not the dank memes !, 
  30 \u00b0 c here , hot but manageable . 
  what do you think should be the ideal weather ? 
  in my opinion 15-25 degrees with lots of sunlight and a bit windy . 
  that feels like paradise . 
  solution : vote the centrists , they do n't make reactionary laws and they usually know how to run the economy . 
  that 's true as well , i 'm not against sunday openings as long as the employees are compensated fairly . 
  your proposal sounds like a better compromise . 
  he 's talking about employees of big supermarkets , not small shops owners . 
  that 's a greek dialect , not italian :p non-italian dialects are colored grey in this map . 
  griko has more in common with modern greek than with italian , anyways it should be the small grey patch in the far south-east , near lecce . 
  anything as long as the eu acts united on it . 
  this is not a problem that italy can tackle on its own . 
  but he does write in english . 
  he just adds a french translation . 
  yes the translation is pointless , but complaining about it is just as pointless . 
  i personally do n't find u/dclauzel 's bilingual posts annoying . 
  or anyone else 's for that matter . 
  as long as the post is in english there 's nothing wrong with adding a translation . 
  in my opinion multilingualism adds a nice touch . 
  yeah pretty much . 
  18/20 , but some of the black metal bands are quite famous . 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/valuutta#finnish etymology either from swedish valuta , russian \u0432\u0430\u043b\u044e\u0442\u0430 ( valj\u00fata ) , all ultimately derived from italian valutare ( `` to weigh up '' )  valuta ( `` currency '' ) . 
  could n't find the hungarian one but presumably has the same origin . 
  0 income and 0 expenses , i live with my parents . 
  representing the 46,6 % from the other thread . 
  i meant fluent proficiency , sorry if i was n't clear . 
  here perfect bilingualism is not yet a thing , many people who speak good english still are n't able to use it as someone who grew up in an english-speaking country would ( me included ) , but we 're slowly getting there . 
  should be renamed polandchat . 
  you do n't have to learn a `` new '' language . 
  as far as i know , english is taught in schools in every european country since elementary school . 
  and thanks to the internet most people consume media in english language , allowing them to learn it faster . 
  nordic countries are * de facto * bilingual , southern countries are catching up in english proficiency . 
  future generations in all europe will speak english as a native language . 
  once there are no language and cultural barriers anymore , it seems only natural that we will become one country since our economies are already interdependent , even if right now the political will is lacking . 
  it will happen . 
  not today , not tomorrow , but in 50 years ? 
  most certainly . 
  but germany introduced minimum wage this year ... 
  and it 's wrong anyway since this guy 's `` northern italy '' includes also 3 central regions that have nothing to do with lega nord 's separatism . 
  no problem , germany seems to be doing fine , we can all copy you guys . 
  it seems a good idea , i 'm in favour of it . 
  same for us . 
  and we show once again that we 're the most backwards country in western europe . 
  great job guys . 
  very well-written , like a short story from a novel . 
  this is quality journalism . 
  i find them quite boring , a lot of them have the same content , where people from both sides of the discourse repeat the same arguments over and over again . 
  the problem is that with so many threads about immigration the front page of this subreddit has much less varied and interesting content . 
  maybe we could create some sort of daily `` immigration megathread '' and sticky it , or even make another subreddit entirely dedicated to the immigration problem , like r/europeanimmigration and move that kind of threads there so that we could go back to talk about everything else related to europe . 
  i think that not wanting to fight does n't mean that you do n't love your country or are a pacifist . 
  i 'm pro nato ant not even against intervention in the middle east but i would n't personally fight because that 's a job for trained professionals , not for civilians . 
  you ca n't just pick up a gun and start shooting enemies like it 's fucking call of duty . 
  yes all 5 of them from pd , according to that site they usually vote following the party line except in a few votes regarding eu-russia relationships . 
  from italy the no votes were the entirety of lega nord , m5s and sel ( far-left ) , plus just one guy from forza italia . 
  all the others voted yes or abstained . 
  - the netherlands ' bike infrastructure - portugal 's drug policies - norway 's prison system - romania 's internet and the anti-corruption agency - germany 's labour market ( minijobs are still better than doing nothing ) - sweden 's welfare - estonia 's e-voting, 
  this guy really complains a lot . 
  also he seems to hate obama for some reason . 
  you guys got some badass surnames . 
  i 'm surprised that the ballots close so early . 
  are n't there problems with long queues since there are millions of people voting ? 
  here in the last local elections ballots were open from 8 am to 11 pm , and in the national elections iirc ballots were open even monday morning . 
  romanians , because ignorant people confuse them with the roma :( the fact that some of the gypsies actually come from romania does n't help , unfortunately . 
  it 's sad because the actual romanians are usually well integrated here and they have to face a wrong stereotype . 
   they call for the setting up of `` an embryo euro area budget '' , `` a fiscal capacity over and above national budgets '' , and harmonised corporate taxes across the bloc . 
  the eurozone would be able to borrow on the markets against its budget , which would be financed from a kind of tobin tax on financial transactions and also from part of the revenue from the new business tax regime . 
   the eurozone 's current bailout fund , the european stability mechanism , which is made up of national contributions under a deal between governments , would be made a common eurozone instrument and converted into a european monetary fund . 
  that would be great , it 's necessary to reform the eu in this way to combat the crisis . 
  me neither , they are so few and never ever caused a problem . 
  might have something to do with the `` the jews did it '' conspiratards , perhaps ? 
  that past is long gone , and wo n't ever come back . 
  i 'd rather be proud of the economic performance than some thing that happened when i was n't around to be honest . 
  what 's the point in being proud of the roman empire when we 're corrupt and broke ? 
  we live in the present and we have to think about the present , and the future and how to make it better . 
  thinking about the past glory wo n't do us any good , it 's only detrimental . 
  so , the liberal alliance , the danish people 's party and the red-green alliance are the euroskeptics ? 
  which are the parties that are most pro-eu integration ? 
  judging by the results , they swapped votes with forza italia ( berlusconi 's party ) which lost lots of votes compared to previous years . 
  most likely fi voters migrated to lega now that berlusconi is n't popular anymore . 
  a lot of people everywhere use wikipedia to know more about their country it seems . 
  ** czech republic !, 
  ** well unfortunately i 've only been in prague but it ' truly an awesome place . 
  - the [ old town ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_town_\\ ( prague \\ ) ) is very nice and well-kept , walking through the narrow streets and looking at the old buildings feels amazing . 
  - a lot of beautiful places worth seeing , like the [ st. vitus ' cathedral ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._vitus_cathedral ) , the area around the [ castle ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prague_castle ) or the lesser known [ vy\u0161ehrad fortress ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vy\u0161ehrad ) . 
  - if you 're interested in art , not far from the city center there 's the [ national gallery ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_gallery_in_prague ) , with 5 stories full of modern and contemporary works of art . 
  - lots of parks and green areas where to go to relax  most of them at a walking distance from the city center . 
  my favourite one was [ letn\u00e1 park ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/letn\u00e1_park ) right above the river . 
  - the food is tasty , but czech republic is mostly known for beer !, 
  there are many local breweries and it 's cheap as fuck , when i was there a pint was around 30czk in most bars , which is a bit more than 1 $ . 
  there 's a bar called [ beer museum ] ( http://www.praguebeermuseum.com/en ) that has like 30 different czech beers on tap if you want to try something different . 
  - nightlife is fun !, 
  a lot of bars and clubs where to spend the night , many of them free entry . 
  a great quantity of events , concerts , parties , it 's impossible to get bored staying in prague :d also every place can be reached easily by public transport which is very efficient and runs frequently day and night . 
  trams are cool . 
  - one of my favourite places in the evening was the riverbank right south of charles bridge , where there are a few open-air bars , some of them on the boats anchored there . 
  - there 's also a small [ beach ] ( http://www.zlutelazne.cz/ ) ( probably more than one but that 's the only one i know of ) on the river in the southern area . 
  last year there was also a free open-air cinema there , really nice . 
  - in a small town few km from prague there 's a small [ church ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sedlec_ossuary ) which interior is decorated with skull and bones . 
  in the same town there 's also a nice looking large gothic church .
