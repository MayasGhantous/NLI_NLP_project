   but you can also send them back again we tried , the european court of human rights fined us with 15.000 $ to immigrant . 
  lol , our navy can do only that , if you try something you receive a fine . 
  the fine was 15.000 $ to immigrant and we spend something as 35 $ to day for them . 
  last year we received 150.000 refugees , essentially a fine of 2.250.000.000 $, 
  the m5s , in italy , proposed a `` basic income '' that the left canned because was racist , why ?

  regressive left :  the regressive left is a political epithet used to negatively characterize a section of leftists who are accused of holding politically regressive views ( as opposed to progressive views ) by tolerating illiberal principles and ideology for the sake of multiculturalism . 
   within the specific context of multiculturalism , british anti-islamism activist maajid nawaz used the term in 2012 in his memoir radical : my journey out of islamist extremism [ note 1 ] to describe `` well-meaning liberals and ideologically driven leftists '' in the united kingdom who na\u00efvely and `` ignorantly pandered to '' islamists and helped islamist ideology to gain acceptance . 
  in a 2015 video presentation on the internet forum big think , nawaz elaborated on the meaning of the term , saying that it describes `` a section of the left '' that has , in his opinion , `` an inherent hesitation to challenge some of the bigotry that can occur within minority communities [ ... ] for the sake of political correctness , for the sake of tolerating what they believe is other cultures and respecting different lifestyles '' . 
  official prophets rank : 1 - muhammed 2 - jesus 3 - hitler,

  maybe he was radicalizated there . 
  in the us they record themselves because making a porn movie is legal , while prostitution is n't legal . 
  it 's similar at the reasoning behind anti-guns people in america , remove the possibility of ** legally ** own a gun and nobody gets shot . 
  obviously criminals ignore the law and in this case the prostitutes life become worse . 
  obviously the solution is to host the olympic games ! ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  [ from their last article : ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/01/isis-destruction-of-palmyra-antiquities-revealed-in-new-pictures )  the syrian president , bashar al-assad is trying to use the capture of palmyra as a propaganda coup , showing he is capable of winning back control of his country from isis , and western-backed rebel forces .
