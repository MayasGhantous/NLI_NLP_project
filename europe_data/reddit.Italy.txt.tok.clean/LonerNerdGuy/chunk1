no it 's not , italy does n't have a distinction . 
  however probably she 's not going to pay and nothing is going to happen , so she can safely avoid it . 
  no not anymore . 
  many of them are quite happy with italy because it 's very generous with giving visas/permits of stay/asylum , in fact it 's the most generous country in europe to do so , so they settled for italy . 
  they are being put in hotels and private flats with all comforts , in fact a harsh controversy recently came out in the press when it emerged that italy spends more per day for migrants ( 35 $ ) than the people homeless from the earthquake ( 20 $ ) . 
  no we did n't pick them up . 
  it was a crime entering illegally in italy , that was the bossi-fini law , they were n't given free healthcare , and they could n't freely roam the cities , they were n't allowed outside the centres they were put in . 
  stop spreading false information , if you do n't know the reasons , then read about it since i take you 're not italian . 
  it was even worse a few years ago and guess what ? 
  no illegal immigrants coming to italy . 
  why is that ? 
  well for starters we did n't go to 12miles off the coasts of africa to pick up migrants , and we had a few functioning laws that have been scrapped by the newer left wing governments . 
  it 's nice to see that the tens of billions of euros sent to bruxelles every year are well spent ... 
  it 's always nice to see how people are able to accept laughable conspiracy theories as true if they fit the perfect hatred for somebody/some state . 
  seems like a rather simplistic and probably faulty explanation to me but everyone chooses what to believe in i guess ... 
  yes of course , i 'm just saying that maybe compared to other empires they were less evil . 
  i think also the roman empire was good . 
  the are kinda right if compared to other empires . 
  italian here . 
  all the press and media depict a very positive image of the european union where anyone who says otherwise is harshly attacked and ridiculed . 
  there is n't really a balanced depiction of the eu , only positive things are being said by the mainstream media . 
  the biggest political parties actively support the eu , with the exception of m5s that , while still being pro eu , criticizes what it thinks it 's wrong with it . 
  i think most italians like the eu . 
   i will not stop being a part of a community that makes the world better for everyone . 
  keep repeating that to yourself , this seems like the kind of talk that i would expect from a member of a cult , and it scares me because i think you actually believe what you 're saying , the same way scientologists believe in all that alien nonsense . 
   it is about making an effort to strenghten rights that , because of how the system was set up , they have not had a chance to share in source ? 
  the system is not set up to discriminate in any way , quite the opposite , at least in western countries the consitution clearly states in italy that everyone must be treated the same . 
   so , still mostly a myth , affirmitive action does not necessarly mean someone gets more rights , and you will not lose a certain right because of it . 
  you keep saying that , that 's the reason why the left wing is dying in all the western world and also why trump got elected ( i do n't even like him ) , because of this bullshit continuously fed to the people that black people are being discriminated against , women are being discriminated against which is simply not true ( in the eu and usa ) . 
  anyone , being that a black person or a woman or whatever who works hard can achieve whatever he wants in the west ( see obama , neil de grasse tyson , merkel ) , and if he ca n't statistically speaking , even with all the affirmative action laws , then the problem lies somewhere else . 
  and see what happens when affirmative laws are implemented in south africa , take a look at their energy company . 
  [ link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/affirmative_action ) [ link2 ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-01/white-south-africans-complain-of-a-reverse-apartheid/7676764 ) but there are many more if you just google search . 
  no it does n't . 
  it robs the people the right to elect the members of the senato , which we currently have , by creating a system where the new members will be nominated by their fellow politicians , so it creates * less * democracy . 
  also italian pms are not taken seriously not because of the current system , but because our pms are entirely spineless . 
  you do n't grow a pair of balls by changing the law , that 's for sure . 
  i do n't like renzi one bit , quite the opposite , but i do n't want him to resign as i think that would be an extremely detrimental situation for our country . 
  all those groups above as of now have the same rights as everyone else . 
  in other countries they have * more * rights through affirmative action programs . 
  and also no , it 's not a myth it 's very real . 
  well he 's right on that one , you can not spare someone from a rightful critic if he/she 's a minority because it creates a dangerous precedent . 
  women want the same right and i agree on that , but with rights also come duties . 
   better in romania generally : climate , people , terrain specifically for me : tax , affordability and the internet is faster . 
  you were in the uk , so can i ask you what 's better in the uk compared to romania and also the other way around ? 
  well for starters it should try to keep its people in , since many romanians move abroad i suppose it 's far from perfect there . 
   i 'm curious on the double standards , why do you hold the eu to such high standards but you do n't apply them to your country ? 
  i apply the same standards here where currently we elect the members of our parliament , camera and senato . 
  i strongly oppose the upcoming referendum which will deny the citizens the right to elect the members of senato and delegate our politicians to elect them instead . 
   each political group in the european parliament picks a candidate who they want as european commission president , if they win the election than their candidate gets to be the commission president . 
  before the 2014 election it was known that the epp nominated juncker as their candidate , epp won the election ( they got the most votes ) and juncker became the commission president . 
  this is just a tautology of what i said , you 're twisting the words to make it sound like you 're in charge of whom meps are going to vote or not , well you are being wrong . 
  and also wrong on a deep level , because if the president was being elected by the people , regardless of your vote for the meps you could have decided who to vote for president . 
  you could have voted for epp meps and elect another president , but you ca n't . 
  you do n't actually know what other nations are going to vote so you can only guess the result , the thing is the system is not democratic at all , and this is fact . 
  if you like it this way , it 's perfectly fine to me , but do n't spread false information on how the thing works as it demonstrate how ill informed you are on the matter .

   is there anything that can be done to stop your doubts ? 
  or are they politically motivated ? 
  yes , your word will do , thanks . 
  you provided a thorough explanation and being from germany i suppose you know what you 're talking about . 
  if this is truly the case , then ok . 
  i still have my doubts though . 
   kid had an unauthorized absence from school , which is finable , parents refused to pay fine , so it escalates . 
   if that 's the case , then it might be understandable . 
  however as i said before i think the thing escalated so fast because he missed a trip to a mosque , had he missed another trip or day at school i doubt the same thing would have happened . 
  i wonder if the same would have happened in case the child missed * another * day , i seriously doubt they would have taken his parents to court , it was clearly politically motivated . 
  unbelievable if true . 
  i heard corsican language and it 's pretty understandable to me as an italian ( from sardinia ) . 
  do most corsican people speak corsican or french on everyday life ? 
  please check his username , u/trolls _ brigade is just doing his job,
