  as concerns the elections , everywhere in italy , except in the north , the main national parties are the ones that get the most votes , we also have a few small independentist parties but they do n't get many votes . 
  in spain on the other hand i see that the language and the culture are being actively taught at school , i see basques and catalans ( maybe others ) receive a proper education at school . 
  the state considers your minorities as something to be preserved , an asset , not a nuisance like our state does . 
  actually i do n't get catalan independentists because from my point of view , as an italian , the spanish government has been very generous and understanding towards its minorities : they teach the local languages , they have signs in the local languages and they respect their unique cultures . 
  i wish our government did the same here , in reality it does the opposite . 
  sardinia can into spain ? 
  the home countries usually refuse to take them back , arguing they 're not their citizens , it 's not this easy . 
  these millions of people that we have now in europe , the majority in italy , are going to stay here . 
  no entirely different matter . 
  morocco was n't even a country when spain controlled those territories , and actually before they were roman empire controlled cities , so we 're talking much more time . 
  gibraltar on the other end was literally stolen by force . 
  ok i must have misunderstood the whole thing then !, 
  i thought you did n't talk at all , to strangers and acquaintances alike for some kind of an unwritten rule . 
  in the italian transports usually you do n't talk to strangers , but if there are people you know you can talk to them . 
  buses are usually very loud because there 's lots of people talking to each other , but not other strangers , i thought that was also the case abroad . 
  he does in italy . 
  the italian state spends about 1000 $ per month per migrant . 
  ah , there 's my favorite shitposter !, 
  but this is kinda lame , you can do better , i saw your other comments , try harder !, 
  there 's olio secchi in sardinia where i live that 's very good . 
  because all the other european countries , in violation of the redistribution treaties they signed , are refusing to take them in . 
  also france and austria in violation of the schengen treaty have closed their borders . 
  and we have our guilt too , we should n't allow them to freely come here , we should be patrolling our waters to prevent illegal entry the way we did before , the way spain and greece did before a few years back , opening fire against the vessels if necessary , or how spain did when it had to deal with illegal immigrants getting in ceuta and melilla . 
  ok that explains it !, 
  ours were the green ones and we harvested in october , it makes sense . 
  i already harvested mine almost two month before , i have a small olive garden , it is only for own production since it produced about 17 litres of oil . 
  but why do you harvest yours this late ? 
  is it because of different climates in spain ? 
  yes it is . 
  european navies go up to 12 miles off the coasts of africa to pick up migrants , they actually * phone * the italian coast guard to let them know they are about to go , this way they do n't risk drowning or anything . 
  and there is also a private german organisation with its own boat that goes there to bring the migrants to italy . 
  this is against the italian law , since we have a law that forbids people to facilitate illegal immigration , but italian prosecutors do n't do anything about it . 
  the problem is already pretty bad here in italy , it 's just that you do n't see it in other eu countries since france and austria suspended schengen a year ago so the migrants are all stuck here in italy . 
  lol ok , i saw you trolling on r/italy also , must be rewarding . 
  north africans are white you know , they have a similar olive color then ours in italy . 
  no it 's wrong . 
  * ombrelli * with a final * i * is the plural form , therefore you ca n't use the singular article . 
  * ombrello * on the other hand is singular , so you can say `` an ombrello '' , `` a spaghetto '' , `` a panino '' . 
  source : i 'm italian and i live in italy . 
  we do n't have immigrants from other eu countries , except romanians and lots of illegal immigrants from africa . 
  we would like to have more from germany , spain , france ecc . 
  but we have little to offer to them so they prefer their own country :-(, 
  ahem estonia can you lend it to us for a little while ? 
  ahem , nope . 
  well i guess i learned something new today . 
  well for once i fully agree with turkey . 
  of course that does n't affect the fact that the turkish press is probably way worse than ours . 
  in italian you do n't say * ombrella * , you say * ombrello * . 
  i hope she 'll follow the path of her ( former ) colleagues . 
   not according to your own graphic . 
  there it grew until 2007/08 . 
   the growth was significantly lower than before the euro , especially compared to the boom of the 80s and meanwhile the debt increased significantly . 
   you mean , like , there was some kind of financial meltdown between 2002 and 2016 ? 
  maybe even around 2008 ? 
  no , i mean compared to the other countries , and anyway we had another economic meltdown in the early 90s and also the early 80s , but we had our own currency and even despite that we managed to achieve incredible growth . 
   stiglitz has no skin in the game and he is n't an expert on monetary integration.he just wants to sell his book . 
  of course !, 
  a highly regarded academic who thinks it differently than you must be crazy !, 
  by the way it 's pretty common for intellectuals to be writing and selling books based on their experience and work or studies , it 's rarer the opposite . 
  it 's through books that you spread knowledge on a topic , all my university professors have written * at least * a book . 
   of course if you still had the lira you could very well print yourself out of the debt at the cost of serious inflation via currency depreciation that much holds true yes we had that tool at our discretion , and it was one of the reasons behind what it 's called `` miracolo economico italiano '' that brought italy from being a country in ruins after ww2 , to being a g8 country . 
  now with this strong currency our economy , but not only ours in europe , has been crashed because it does n't reflect the country , the same way euro does not represent greece . 
   they had conspirationists like claudio messora in charge of their pr . 
  they fired him , and again , the movement has been pretty clear that conspiracy theories are n't part of their program . 
   now they have rocco casalino in his place , a former `` big brother '' contestant . 
  he holds a degree in electronic engineering in italy with master in economics from the usa , he speaks six languages and works as a professional journalist . 
  ah yeah , he was a big brother contestant , so what ? 
  does n't his curriculum and work speak for itself ? 
  i think it 's pretty impressive . 
   but so far it seems that he was absolutely correct . 
  it was n't and i explained it to you in detail why not , but you prefer to take as factual a rumor instead of the truth . 
  it 's fine by me anyway , i believe anyone should be able to believe whatever he/she wants . 
   according to your own graph the dept skyrocket between 82-92 . 
   in those years we had a growth of 3-4 % ** per year ** . 
  the country was experiencing an economic boom those years , so it comes naturally that also the debt increased . 
  when we joined the euro on the other hand the growth of the gdp immediately stopped , and in 16 years we grew of only 3 % all the years combined . 
  again , listen to what stigliz has to say about it . 
  it 's fine if you do n't agree with them . 
  this is the democracy , you 're free to disagree and state your position , i explained it because i hear lots of rumors and blatantly fake `` facts '' about this or that italian party and i wanted to clarify the situation . 
   it , however , shows the lack of political background or any sort of background for that matter , that the m5s mps have . 
  most of them are literally random people who seized the opportunity for their own gain . 
   again , post factual information . 
  it 's true the vast majority are `` new men '' , although i would n't say they 're in it for their own gain : they are the only mps who willingly cut in half their wages and * refused * millions of euros given by the state , if they really were in it only for the money they should have gone to other parties where they keep all their salaries ** and ** the millions given by the sate . 
   di maio , the speaker of the lower house , did not manage to complete his university studies . 
  this is another lie , he has a law degree for which he took more time to complete , and that 's actually the norm in italy given how difficult the university system is , in particular for some faculties it 's extremely rare to finish it on time . 
   of course , everybody can run for office , but because of the way their `` primaries '' worked have , in practice , elected people who are ill-prepared to be a politician i partly agree on this . 
   are we prepared to have our economical policy set by people who believe that the bilderberg group secretly controls the world ? 
  i agree on the fact that we should cast some light on some secret organizations . 
  i do n't know if you knew , but there was a secret society in italy , of which berlusconi was a member , called p2 that wanted to do a some kind of * coup d'etat * . 
  they eventually were discovered by the justice system , many people have been convicted for that . 
  so it 's in the interests of everyone to make sure that powerful people do n't abuse their powers like berlusconi tried to do with the p2 . 
   although it is not part of their programme , why are these five stars movement politicians publicly spreading such nonsense ? 
  also , is it false that they 've talked about chemtrails at the european parliament ? 
  i do n't know if they spoke about it in the european parliament , but the party clearly stated that those were only personal views absolutely not endorsed by the movement . 
  in democracy you hear everyone 's opinion , be it preposterous or real . 
  you hear lots of bullshit from the other parties too , it 's just that they do n't make it to the international press . 
  [ debito ] ( https://www.blia.it/debitopubblico/grafico2012.png ) it skyrocketed when we joined the euro ** and ** meanwhile the gdp growth stopped . 
  actually many academics , such as economics nobel prize winner stigliz , are pretty adamant on this point . 
  because they have a * de facto * foreign currency , and problem will represent itself sooner or later . 
   furthermore , we did you a huge favour by not defaulting .
