  it 's funny how when there 's a right wing government automatically is branded as xenophobic , authoritarian and usually they also say populist . 
  and then you see the source : the guardian , which is not politically biased at all ... 
  the poles have democratically elected this government whether you like it or not , live with it . 
   you do n't make much sense buddy , if anything , we pay for russian gas . 
  also , sanctions do not mean a ban of all and every economical interaction with russia . 
  i do n't know if you 're being serious or not , judging from your comment . 
  yes you pay for the gas , and then you sell it to ** all ** the other countries in europe that need it making a profit out of it . 
  and everyone knows how much energy ( oil , gas , whatever ) is worth nowadays . 
  this is basic economics , easy is n't it ? 
   but sure , italia is absolutely known for its consistency , you can be very proud of that well , we 're being consistent at that , we opposed the sanctions . 
  no , i 'm not very proud of our ( unelected ) government , i 'll have to agree with you on this . 
  but you should be proud on yours for pulling the strings needed to avoid incrimination for your volkswagen-gate . 
  have fun spending yours coming from your russian gas , but unlike you , at least we have the balls to be consistent with our decisions , germany on the other end on the surface calls for more sanctions and covertly builds the north stream . 
  italy as a country had warm relations with russia even during the cold war , i personally do n't think the sanctions are fair , and it 's quite ironic hearing this from a german , since your country is doing big business with russia in spite of the sanctions ( does north stream ring a bell ? 
  ) , i 'd say that 's quite hypocritical is n't it ? 
  no it did not . 
  this . 
   hint : they are n't russophiles , they just have deals with russia which make them sh * ttons of money . 
  it 's f ** king business as usual . 
  yes you get it . 
  italy had lots of deals with russia , we used to export a lot of food , mainly from the north of italy , we had an agreement between poste italiane ( italian post ) to help russia improve it postal service , and of course enel , eni and other energy companies invested a lot in russia . 
  also we , as italians , do n't have anything against russia and do n't support the sanctions . 
  lol envy can truly push someone to rationalize even the most absurd explanation as true , such as * spain ranks higher than < insert nordic country  ?!, 
  the math is clearly wrong !, 
   emilia romagna , lombardy and veneto still probably have the best healthcare in europe ( to non italians , you must know that healthcare in italy is regionalized since the early 00s ) yes i think so to . 
  however i believe that the devolution of healthcare to the regions has been detrimental overall , and undoubtedly the national healthcare in the 90s and early 2000s was way better than now . 
  i would say it was in the last 5 years . 
  some of the policies adopted by chavez were actually very useful , but he made some big mistakes in other important fields . 
  yep , and it used to be better before all these cuts , we used to be second in the world after france in the year [ 2000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_health_organization_ranking_of_health_systems_in_2000 ), 
  oh come on , everything else is perfect up there in sweden , will you leave something for the others ? 
  no problem , once they catch the guy , he 'll be put in a swedish maximum security prison to spend his 1 month sentence with only a ps4 and a xbox one with no wifi and limited internet !!, 
  : just kidding , sweden might be lenient on its sentences but it also have one of the lowest recidivism rates so their system actually works . 
   the problems with the euro are structural . 
  spain , italy and portugal are all in deep shit as well because of how the system works . 
  this guy gets it . 
   recent revelations show he already had secret contacts with goldman sachs when he was still president of the ec . 
  1  this does n't surprise me one bit . 
   volkswagen is being protected as it is one of the most massive companies in europe . 
  they bring a lot of money in and employ a tons of people throughout europe . 
  they own seat , audi , volkswagen , etc. 
  in portugal autoeuropa ( vw factory ) is the biggest exporter gpd wise . 
  oh please , this is a nice euphemism , `` is being protected '' . 
  no it is a german company , it benefits germany , it is a clear demonstration of the double standard applied in europe . 
   they bring a lot of money in and employ a tons of people throughout europe . 
  they own seat , audi , volkswagen , etc. 
  in portugal autoeuropa ( vw factory ) is the biggest exporter gpd wise . 
  yes it employs people and all the money flows back to the headquarters , the same applies to fiat , it has factories in poland , the usa , russia and yet the money goes back here . 
   or just the eu protecting itself from massive layouts throughout its members and blows to each country 's economy ? 
  it does n't protect ( all ) its members , just some of them . 
  anyway i think your explanation is so preposterous that i 'm going to end it here , you go ahead if you want . 
  you 're talking about it as if it was a hypothetical scenario , it 's already happening actually . 
  the `` good countries '' consistently break the law and do n't pay for it . 
  just take a look at the ( newest ) big gift given to germany regarding volkswagen : since they cheated on their emissions data , europe decided to * double * the legal limits , thus preventing european countries to sue volkswagen like they did in the usa . 
  [ link ] ( http://phys.org/news/2016-02-eu-lawmakers-diesel-loopholes-vw.html ) . 
  i do n't see why the small countries should abide the law where giants consistently bends it in their favour . 
   i agree . 
  it 's not bending the rules . 
  it is plainly illegal . 
   this is your opinion , ireland does n't agree with you . 
  hopefully the eu will turn a blind eye the same way it did with the `` big countries '' . 
   how is that ironic ? 
  the eu members decided that such bailouts are not good for the banking system , so they made them impossible . 
  and those rules were n't forced upon germany by the eu . 
  germany had similar legislation way before that . 
  well , i mean of course it 's ironic that now it imposes those laws on other countries when it did just the same on a * way bigger scale * just a few years ago to save its own banks . 
  there 's a clear disparity of treatment , something that you used legally a few years back suddenly becomes a big no-no . 
  it 's hypocritical and our premier reminded president merkel of that . 
   if there are countless examples of germany ignoring laws , name a few where germany actually violates laws . 
  the mip procedures are the same for every country . 
  not only germany . 
  please go take a look at france case , they consistently surpassed the 3 % deficit/gdp limit rule and they have not been sanctioned . 
  there are countless case of when european laws are blatantly bent or even broken such as this case . 
   if north stream is illegal , why does renzi not take it to the commission or to a court instead of complaining to the eu parliament ? 
  do n't be naive , as you know italy is not doing great economically speaking , so he 's not gon na go against germany on this hoping to maybe reach a deal of some king on some matters . 
  i know , as a country italy has been fined for subsidizing fiat . 
  however it 's not clear if that 's the same case legally speaking . 
  i know all too well , that 's one reason i 've become euro-skeptic after being pro-europe all my life . 
  i know , i saw the data . 
  what i want to say is that  but it really depresses me that we continually see special treatment and rules being bent for the larger nations , especially germany and france , while everyone else has to do what they are told . 
  this really describes what 's going on in europe . 
  so i can understand the point of view of ireland . 
   germany wo n't stop anyone from bailing out their banks with their own money . 
  yes it does . 
  yes now there a new rules , this is true , and by the new rules germany could n't have saved its own banks which is a bit ironic . 
   f you want to sanction countries just because they violate the macro-economic rules i do n't want sanctions against germany , in fact italy never required them and yes there is a disparity of treatment among the states , there are countless examples , these are just a few . 
   the sanctions against russia are n't a full embargo . 
  north stream might violate the spirit of the sanctions , but it does n't violate the letter of the sanctions . 
  this is just not true , because of the same sanctions italy has been forced to stop the so called south stream that would have allowed us the distribution of gas in sourthern europe . 
  now germany has the exclusive . 
  ** fun fact : ** when prime minister renzi reminded this to the european parliament , he received the support of all european countries except germany and the netherlands , the countries north stream is gon na pass in . 
  i do n't know if that applies to this case . 
  so what ? 
  their country their law . 
  that 's one of the reason ireland was able to recover so well from the crisis , good for them . 
   the `` cure '' that the countries took whose economy is doing fine now ? 
  are you being serious ? 
  probably not . 
   how dare those pesky germans impose their shitty frugal ideas on others !, 
  really ? 
  germany used 250 billion $ to save its banking system back in i think was in 2005 or so and now it 's forbidding other nations to do the same thing they did .
