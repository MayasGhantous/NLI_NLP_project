  ** fun fact : ** we were second in the list , but that was a long time ago now are probably 20th or something . 
  this . 
  well as i said before these kind of treaties are beneficial for some parties and actually * damaging * to others . 
  i said neo-liberalism has positive ( for some ) and negative ( for some ) effects . 
  i see from your flag that you 're from germany and it 's undeniable that your country had the right conditions ( political , economical , judicial , fiscal ) to make the most out of the system and it did , quite successfully . 
  in your specific situation the positive effects are quite visible for anyone , and most economical indicators confirm this . 
  unfortunately not all the countries have the same economical structure and/or situations to benefit from a complete deregulation , in some other countries the same situation you 're in could mean the economic demise of it . 
  and economical indicators track this trend through the years . 
  ahahahah wow i did n't see that coming !, 
  the discussions was being quite civil and then this . 
   then no one can trade with anyone else now you 're putting words in my mouth , i 'll just say this : if you read again what i said , i stated that what in economical politics is known as `` the italian miracle '' was pretty much due to italy 's capability to be great exporter ( hence trading with other countries ) . 
  i never said not to trade , i said i believe states should have sovereignty over trade decisions . 
  i believe treaties should be arranged on individual countries . 
   , but your position is not supported by any mainstream economist ( 98 % of academic economists ) this is just not true . 
  anyway it was a nice exchange of ( very ) different opinions . 
   but if you object to the principle , you are basically saying that we should never have a treaty covering anything beyond tariffs . 
  actually this is not correct . 
  we had individual treaties with individual countries . 
  that did n't prevent italy from becoming a g8 nation , starting from the debris of the ww2 where the country was literally in ruins , still with little influence from the eec ( economical european community ) and it did just fine . 
  to be fair it did * better * than now that there 's much more freedom . 
   then a labour union for steel workers will say `` you ca n't get rid of tariffs on steel , or we 'll campaign against it in order to protect our jobs '' , and a manufacturing industry will say `` you need to cut tariffs on steel so we can manufacture stuff cheaper , increasing employment and making people richer or we 'll campaign against it '' . 
  ok this is spot on . 
  this is exactly one of the best arguments * against * the ttip . 
  and i 'm saying this because i actually lived it upon myself , being italian i know what neo-liberism brought to us . 
  it has positive ( for some people ) effects and negative ( for some people ) effects . 
  many european countries actually became * poorer * thanks to the direct and indirect effect of an almost complete market deregulation . 
  a few examples ? 
  well fiat comes to mind , as soon as it had the chance to relocate to poland it did just that , being able to pay the poles a fraction of what it paid italians , hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs , italy lost the taxes that fiat used to pay here and it snowballed from there . 
  this is just one example , i could cite tens more with all those nice graphs with all those nice coloured economical indicators of what we lost the same exact moment deregulation took place . 
  another example ? 
  ok italian food . 
  now we 're invaded from lower quality foreign food that just sells better because of course producing the same good in a country where the average wage is a fifth of yours or it 's a fiscal haven is going to cost less . 
  that 's unfair competition . 
  who wins in the picture ? 
  the big ones of course , like fiat many other big companies who can relocate . 
  however there are a ( few ) positive effects that do not , at least not in italy 's case , counterweight the negative ones . 
  some of these positive effects are , as i said before , that many goods will probably have a lower cost for the final buyer , so i suppose with ttip for instance buying an ipad would cost significantly less . 
  the positive effects however are not positive for your homecountry , but only for the company you 're buying the good from . 
   there 's an awful lot of fearmongering going around , just as there was around the negotiations themselves . 
  there 's not . 
  the vast majority of the press in italy is actually * pro * , and the italian government is one of the ones who strongly pushed to close the deal as soon as possible . 
  anyway i 'm going to end it since we are hijacking the thread :-) i 'll just leave it to `` i agree to disagree with you '' . 
  i was talking about ttip . 
  i 'll take a look at official websites , i 'll do that . 
  what i do and i did was keeping myself constantly informed through many newspapers etc , so unless each and everyone of them , italian , french and international was talking bullshit , it does n't change what i said one bit . 
  what i said about secrecy is common knowledge and the procedures i described above are still in place . 
  italian mps for instance unlike meps do n't have full access , and there was a harsh debate recently about it when our presidente della camera allowed them a bit of access . 
   why isds is n't actually that bad that 's probably one of the most negative aspects of it all , but it 's clear to me that we have different opinions regarding ttip and i 'm not going to argue about that , i did n't want to get into the * why * it 's bad according to me . 
  i just stated a plain fact around its controversial confidentiality . 
  and it stands . 
  the rest is a matter of opinions , if you like the treaty it 's fine to me , i do n't care , that was n't my point . 
  they did n't say anything specific about it , much of the controversy was/is around the secrecy . 
  even now it 's still a big secret , meps are only allowed to see the papers in a controlled room without the possibility of taking pictures . 
  they just said `` oh yeah we 're talking about a trade deal with the us '' . 
  that 's it . 
  nothing else . 
  this according to you amounts to :  they publicly announced they were negotiating it , had websites , launched public consultations . 
  anyway there 's a nice thorough explanation on [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transatlantic_trade_and_investment_partnership ) that i just read read to refresh my memory . 
  you should refresh yours too . 
   sounds reasonable to me ... would n't italians also support their local businesses prioritizing italians with the same credentials over swiss applicants as well ? 
  actually it makes perfect sense . 
  of course italy is going to defend its citizen 's interests by raising its voice , and that makes sense too . 
  what i admire about switzerland , whether it 's being right or wrong on this , it 's that it actually ** asks ** its people what they want before acting , so yes i respect them for defending their interests and i respect italy for trying to pressure switzerland into defending ours . 
  well most of our power came from manufacturing and exporting , and we did that by having the ability to depreciate our currency , now it 's not possible , that 's why starting with the sme , and the euro then , our export took a huge blow . 
  actually it was being kept secret for a long time until a leak revealed it , but yes you do have a point when you say that many people simply do n't care about these things . 
  there are many other cultures that do n't work in europe and yet you propose to kick out a country that is perfectly integrated with western values and did a great job at improving its economical situation beyond the best expectations . 
  just because you do n't like him or his political view does n't mean that he 's a fascist . 
  ahhh switzerland , the bastion of democracy !, 
  one of the few places on earth where they make a referendum even for deciding to raise the minimum wage . 
  i envy you :-( i 'm from italy and this is our third unelected government ... can we have a little bit of your system ? 
  it 's just a * bit * biased , however it seems the hungarian government is the only one to actually * ask * its people what they think about something before acting . 
   on the other hand some of the factories went bankrupt , not being able to compete with their western counterparts after romania open up its domestic market well that 's happening in italy too , unfortunately these are the side effects of neo-liberism, 
  i am italian and i confirm : i also use the bidet every time . 
  for us i think it 's like being used to brush your teeth . 
  also it does n't take that much of a time . 
  not to italy : we are net givers . 
  beautiful !, 
  she 's not beautiful , the other women were stunning , this one has been chosen purely for political correctness . 
  that 's right , we should share the burden . 
  really ? 
  this comes from the same ones who hacked and continue to hack [ millions of yahoo accounts ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/gchq-nsa-webcam-images-internet-yahoo ) , and stole images from the computers and they 're telling us about the russians ? 
  talking about hypocrisy . 
  does n't matter , many of those crimes , groping etc go unreported , but are still present . 
  not from the pipes , because those were encrusted with calcium deposits and it 's been shown how they did n't leak lead . 
  but they probably were poisoned by lead barrels in which they put wine , from which acetic acid would lead to the formation of lead acetate , a sweet toxic compound of lead that would also explain the gout episodes of ancient romans , since gout is a symptom of saturnism . 
  yours too if you 're living anywhere in europe . 
  well we are in the forth one right now , are n't we ? 
  i do n't get this , i 'm bad at reading . 
  the difference is that in most statistics the north ranks on pair with germany , then you average it out with all the regions and you get the whole picture ... 
  what 's good is that at least we 're consistently improving at math over the years , which is a subject strongly linked to the development of a country . 
  for the other subjects , my god !, 
  italy can into ignorance . 
  that is some great diy engineering !, 
  probably cheap to make but extremely effective . 
  yes , italian was chosen from the tuscan dialect , but in the other states in italy there were many other different languages . 
  where i come from we speak sardinian logudorese , but italian is the official language , they teach only that at school unfortunately unlike spain where they give much more weight to local minorities . 
  usually those other languages are very difficult to understand , for instance i ca n't understand sicialian nor neapolitan except for a few words maybe . 
  thanks to the spanish heritage on the other end i can understand a great deal of spanish , a some words of catalan since there 's a lot of those in sardinian . 
  also i 'd like to add that even northerners speak `` wrong '' , for instance they use the definite article when referring to a person and that is grammatically wrong . 
   yea , i always get reminded of this whenever i hear that italian southerners are much poorer and speak like animals .
