  mother maria bless spain . 
  care to explain ? 
  i do n't `` speak like an animal '' , and it 's not spain 's fault for the economical differences between the north and the south . 
  yes that 's right , you know history !, 
  the previous domain of of spain is still very visible in our local language , through many words of catalan and castilian descent . 
  i agree on everything . 
  except that spanish is an italian dialect , not the other way around . 
  just kidding , i was trying to trigger some catalans but it did n't work :-( . 
  by the way , me being sardinian , here there 's a city where they still speak an ancient version of catalan . 
  i do n't know about other states but in italy we just say `` euro '' . 
  during the first years of the euro we usually though of something in lire to truly understand its value , now we just reason in euros . 
  is n't it the same ? ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding, 
  yes it is , at least in italy . 
  we draw the line at germany , the last country of western culture and from there is an abrupt change to the ee countries . 
  so what ? 
  guys use this kind of talk everyday , he was n't even a politician back then so who cares . 
  it was rude , for sure , but part of a clear smearing campaign . 
  i mean they could n't find dirt on him so they attacked him for his rudeness , really ? 
  i respect someone who does n't like trump for his ideas , but not this dirty tricks used to discredit somebody . 
  no doubt that if marine le pen were a man some kid would say he 'd been molested by him . 
  except that cosby was n't running for president like trump did . 
  that 's what i was thinking too !, 
  just like trump , many women claiming to have been raped by him in the 90s , conveniently all decided to press charges just a few months before the elections 20 years later . 
  and obviously they were all '' * he said , she said * '' , no evidence whatsoever . 
  not really , maybe a few words . 
  no problem , we 're importing hundreds of thousands new possible consumers from abroad every year . 
   italy decided to get ahead with the plans to adopt the euro because it gave them an immense benefit . 
  i keep hearing the same dogmatic response every time , without a proper mathematical explanation . 
  in fact it happened the exact opposite , italy has been suffering a recession from the very moment we joined the eurozone , clearly it was n't good for us , it was for other countries ' economies , but not for ours ( and greece too ) . 
   italy 's public debt skyrocketed in the 1980s this is true , and knowing how macroeconomics works it was n't a big deal since we had our own currency that we could print anytime , and it fact we were always able to repay it without any problem and we experienced one of the greatest growths since the [ italian economic miracle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_economic_miracle ) . 
   reached almost unbearable levels in 1992 . 
  you did n't read what i wrote before or you do n't seem to have a proper knowledge of it : for those who do n't know in 92 there was the famous ems ( yes that 's right !, 
  that 's the thing i was talking before !, 
  ) , called european monetary system that with its control on curriencies value , erm ( exchange rate mechanism ) pegged all the participant 's countries currencies to a fixed value , it was a * soft * euro ** de facto ** . 
  the same effects destroyed uk accounts , ours and we both dropped out of the ems . 
  the difference being that the uk was smart enough to give up the euro project altogether , while our politicians decided to go ahead despite the mathematical evidence was there . 
   by adopting the euro , the italian state has enjoyed much lower interest rates on state borrowings . 
  it does n't change a thing , because for instance despite variable interests rates back then everyone could afford a house and a mortgage , now even with low interests the number of mortgages plummeted , and so did the persons who are able to buy a house . 
  also immediately after joining the euro , we 've been experiencing another huge increase of the public debt , ** but ** this time is very different , because we 're contracting it in a * foreign * currency , over which we have no control at all . 
   alas , italian politicians and entrepreneurs are short sighted and did not see the rise of china coming this is the only true thing so far , and unfortunately is not true only for italy but for the whole europe as well , as it 's the eu that wanted to grant china a free trade agreement . 
   of course , when the moment to reform the system came , the italians chose a man whore with no interest for anything but his own companies , so those crucial reforms never saw the light . 
  you do n't seem to have a grasp on the basic concepts of economics , such as the difference between deficit , debit , gdp and how all of these indicators relate to the currency , how a currency is defined and it 's impact on a country 's economy . 
  you keep talking about our politicians , i suppose you mean berlusconi , possibly craxi if you 're not too young to rember , but we did n't have only them : we had many other irreprensibile and honest : prodi , d'alema , the recent ones monti , letta , renzi all very honest but absolutely impotent towards the euro situation . 
   germany has almost no guilt , mate . 
  the woes of italy , greece and maybe spain are almost always caused by ourselves . 
  one of the biggest guilt lies upon italy 's politicians who , unwisely , decided to get us into euro . 
  germany on the other hand bears some other guilt , but that 's not the point here . 
  you do n't have to take my word for it , debt repayment is a public matter . 
  go take a look at the data , no default for italy so far . 
  the same can not be said for other big central european countries , whose debt has been partially forgiven after ww1 and ww2 . 
  actually we can , and we did , so far we paid every external debt we had , we never had a debt forgiveness , so despite the stereotype so far we 've always been good to our word . 
  i 'm italian , olive skin , this means i 'm in danger too ? 
  bavaria can not into independence . 
  clearly you are referring to mafia , seeing how well educated you are on the matter / s , you do know that mafia is n't present in every region right ? 
  for instance i come from sardinia which is historically always been free from mafia . 
  at least do a little fact check if you want to talk about stereotypes . 
  no i did n't say that spain is doing well ** only ** because of the money it received . 
  i said that that was one of the reasons , others are a different political situation , different economies , different ages of the population . 
  clearly spanish politicians have done good job in that regard . 
  as i said before , it 's not simple matter to analyse a country 's economy in a few lines on reddit . 
  but as regards some small ee economies , much of that growth is actually subsidized and a significant competitiveness is due to their sovereign currency . 
  you have low crime rates because you have a very homogeneous society , in italy happened the exact opposite and spanking went out of fashion . 
   now you 're just coming across as as fucking prick . 
  i apologize :( but this really set me off :  the economic health of a country does not , despite many claim , revolve around it 's currency . 
  because it 's simply plain wrong . 
  well i 'm not for spanking a kid * at all costs * , so if your son is a nice kid there 's no need to spank him !, 
  but if all the other methods do n't work , well , believe me a little spanking is going to do go for him , it 's not going to cause any bullshit trauma , as i said here is ( it 's being less used nowadays ) perfectly normal . 
  and i mean spanking , ** not ** savage beating . 
  after all , our parents have been educated that way and are respectable , honest people , it 's the new ones i see a little too much undisciplined bordering on delinquency . 
   the economic health of a country does not , despite many claim , revolve around it 's currency . 
  the recession the uk was facing was due to the effects of the ems and it 's currency pegging , the erm that was ironically called by some economists of the period as eternal recession mechanism , go read something about it . 
   spain has seen better economic growth than the uk for the past 2 years , is that also because of the currency ? 
  spain has been doing better for many reasons , a significant one is the spain is a net `` receiver '' from the eu budget , that is it takes more euros that it gives . 
  the same applies to poland for example , and that 's the reason ( other than having their own currency ) behind the eastern european countries miracle growth , it 's subsidized economy . 
  actually the same applied to cuba during the golden ages of the cold war , it received so much money from moscow that it had very high growth rates . 
  the moment the soviet union collapsed and moscow money ended , it went into the current economical shit situation is in , and the same would apply tomorrow to poland , romania etc. 
  if the eu stopped its money redistribution program . 
  from the definition of gdp you know that it is defined as the sum of money produced inside the country and the one the flows in , so all that nice currency it gets from the eu actually pushes its growth numbers . 
  this is math . 
   does every country doing well in the eurozone not count , because it does n't fit into the narrative that decades of poor management can not be fixed in a few years ? 
  every country is different with a different economy and a more or less well suited currency . 
  do you know how the euro is defined ? 
  do you know that the value of euro is not random but actually defined as a percentage of the countries that created it ? 
  this means that germany , with 30 % , weight more in the value of euro as compared to , for instance italy with a mere 10 % approx . 
  it also means that euro is a fairly strong currency for italy . 
  i could go on , but it 's impossibile to go into the specifics on a single post on reddit and explain a whole complex matter , but if you want to know more , there are some nice macroeconomics books on amazon . 
  nope . 
  as i said it was the result of the [ failed experiment of the european monetary system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_monetary_system#1992_crisis ) , that was the way that paved the entrance of the uk and the other european countries into the eurozone . 
  the uk ( and also italy ) suffered greatly from that and were forced to drop out of the ems , the uk made the wise decision to never enter the euro , italy on the other hand , despite the evidence of the trial , decided to join in anyway , with the current results visible to anyone . 
  fun fact : all the media predicted apocalyptic scenarios for the decision of the uk not to enter the eurozone , it actually happened the exact opposite : it was one of the big eu countries that grew the most and recovered better from the 2008 crisis . 
  and why do you think they decided to opt out , just on hunch ? 
  did you know the uk was set to enter the euro ? 
  and that it opted out when the general trials , in the early 90s called the ems completely failed destroying the uk 's public accounts giving them no other choice than to opt out . 
  those same trials did the same to italy and for whatever reason they were ignored and we decided nevertheless to join the eurozone leading to the current economical situation and more than 15 years of economic depression ( yes , since we joined the euro italy has been getting poorer ) . 
  where i live ** everyone ** used to spank their kids when they behaved badly , pretty much everywhere in italy they did that , and guess what ? 
  in my village there is zero criminality , everyone leaves its door open nobody steals from you and i never had any trauma from it . 
  because , for fuck 's sake , it is just a spanking !!, 
  coincidentally now the newer generations behave badly and they are the ones that they got spared from this treatment . 
  our government proposed the same exact thing but without a jury , an agency that decides what news are to be published and what not , and yet nobody said a thing . 
  from my point of view ** both ** proposals are ridiculous and worthy of the worst dictatorships .
