  i agree . 
  it did not , that was the side of the story of the criminals who kidnapped 25 people inside and set fire everywhere . 
  in fact health authorities deny that . 
  many italians die each day for health realated problems , some of those avoidable possibly , but you never hear italians going to hospitals and kidnapping doctors and setting fires . 
  i agree with you as an italian , unfortunately our left wing ( unelected ) government does n't agree . 
   italian nationalists do not exist this is very true . 
  and a little bit unfortunate if you want my opinion , we are very critical of italy , we do n't take pride in the good things we have and that does n't help making out shitty situation better . 
  i saw the other examples and they were bad photoshopped like this one and the other example of `` how < country  sees europe '' , and they 've been allowed , this one has been removed because it was particularly critical of romania , despite being obviously satirical . 
   at the very least easier to integrate and much less violent statistically . 
  clearly you have no idea of the gypsy situation in italy . 
  it 's just a stereotype , we have it as well because of the * siesta * but we know it 's all bullshit . 
  i know , that 's also when they created the new expression `` post factual '' . 
  butthurt from all votes they were losing throughout europe and the usa they decided to censor the news they do n't like . 
   several `` anti-offence '' laws too were planned against anything published in internet ( from news sites , to personal blogs or even comments in forums ) yes , and those same laws are some of strictest in the west world . 
  not to mention a ban on public wifis ( pisanu law if i 'm not mistaken ) , only recently partially removed . 
  this ongoing trend of proposing news filters in west countries is exactly what our countries used to criticize about china , north korea , soviet union etc. 
  the effects are going to be much more pronounced than those of removing `` fake news '' , potentially every critic to the government or the establishment could be considered `` fake news '' and it could lead to the imprisonment of journalists the same way dictatorships do . 
  this possible new law could be abused in any way , and it will believe me , because that 's what have been done in any government with a censorship system . 
  do you remember the year of the * editto bulgaro * of berlusconi ? 
  he did that even without there being a specific law , and renzi with his rai 's management basically alienated all the people critical to him . 
  if something like that were to become a coded law it would be even worse , because for some matters it 's really difficult to define what 's truth and what is not , many independent blogs would cease to exist or would have a pretty rough time . 
  investigative journalism would also have a tough time . 
  anyway , there are also other independent ngos that talk about our bad freedom of the press , so it 's not just this one . 
  holy shit , you 're right !, 
  no i 'm citing what everyone in italy knows since berlusconi 's governments since periodically there is a harsh debate on the condition of our press freedom . 
  the left wing , rightly so , complained and publicly denounced that situation until , ironically , they came to power and we went even ** lower ** on the charts under their governments , in fact now we have a left wing executive . 
  so it 's a not a new situation , it 's becoming the ordinary over the years and it 's getting worse . 
  but you already knew that if you live in italy . 
  oh well , at least i 'm using science to prove my point , yours is completely irrational and delirious if you think romanians are the reason behind italy 's economic power . 
  you discard the mathematical data because you do n't understand it and call me close minded after i explained all my arguments while yours is just : * hurr italy is powerful thanks to romania durr * . 
  just to be clear , as i said above , i do n't think all romanians are criminals nor i think it 's the majority of them , in fact i know a few good people , but hey , just reply to my comments without reading them thoroughly and put words in my mouth . 
  i also sated a mathematical ** fact ** , that i invited you to check either on the newpaper i linked , or better off in [ italy 's offical statistics institute ] ( http://www.istat.it/it/ ) , and that is that we have a very big proportion of crimes committed by romianias citizens , despite them being only a small minority , but you can ignore the truth if you want , i really do n't care . 
  just so you know , italy is not new to this kind of censorship , they call it fake news but they do it periodically on any news inconvenient to politicians or the power in general . 
  in fact we are ** [ 77th in the world ] ( http://www.lastampa.it/2016/04/20/esteri/libert-di-stampa-litalia-crolla-ora-al-posto-jl0lw7t7ev7j31hrkipcwj/pagina.html ) ** for the freedom of the press , one of the lowest levels in europe and in the west , burkina faso and botswana score better than us . 
  so do n't be tempted to do the same , please . 
  the worst part is that they 're doing it in the name of `` democracy '' , just like in the soviet union did the same citing similar reasons . 
   this argument again ? 
  that was a response to explain to an ill informed redditor the `` miracle '' of some eastern europe countries ( coincidentally the ones who take more from the eu budget ) and why the big ones like italy france and yes , even germany have much lower growth rates . 
  i 'm not even arguing whether it 's right or wrong , just stating a fact of mathematical relevance . 
   italy contributes fuck all to romania compared to what hard working romanians generate for italy 's economy or how much you export to romania . 
  i 'm not even going to reply to that .

  ahahah lol i did n't know this one !, 
  you forgot another german great movie : [ the lives of others ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405094/ ), 
  lol funny how you did n't even consider portugal in your map , at least we are your bros ( in crime ) . 
  mathematically speaking leaving the euro ( not the eu ) is a necessary but not sufficient condition for growth . 
  high level corruption ( the only one present in italy ) , while being a huge problem , is not the direct cause of this economic mess ( just take a look at the growth figures during craxi government , one of the highest in more than 30 years , if you do n't know who craxi were look it up ) . 
   what do you think italian politicans would do better in that regard ? 
  this is a difficult question , but what i wrote above is the first thing that needs to be done. , there are some other ones , such as a profound reform of our disgraceful ( in ) justice system , which is very difficult thing to do given how justice members in italy are untouchable , have a huge power , significantly bigger than that of politicians and * de facto * immunity for most wrongdoings . 
   how is leaving the union and say having another decade of deficit spending with little growth not just kicking the can down the road ? 
  i do n't suggest leaving the union but only the euro as i wrote above . 
  of course the current eu is is a sick system , many people have no idea what the eu really is , the lack of democracy therein and how the constant ignoring of the eu problems ( immigration , criminality among eu migrants etc ) are going to destroy the union itself unless it acknowledges its shortcomings and take action to reform itself which is never going to happen seeing by whom we are represented ( jucker , schultz etc ) . 
   all you 'd need to do is look at statistics previous to 1999 , before italy adopted the euro . 
  economic growth was similarly sluggish , [ ... ] no it was not . 
  in 15 years of euro we grew a cumulative amount of ** less ** than 3 % , while in the 90s in only one year we had an average growth of more than 1 % , in just one year , and that was during the years of ems , a * soft euro * system that had its definite negative effects that eventually brought the uk to opt out of the euro and italy to temporarily withdraw from the ems . 
  in the 80s the difference was truly impressive , in the second half of the 80s in one year we had a growth of more than 4 % . 
  but it 's really too complicated to discuss it in detail , it 's quite clear if you are functionally competent in math and know a little macroeconomics , just go take a look at the main economics indicators from the 70s to nowadays , and read about the ems , what euro is , i mean how its value has been decided etc , you will see how a currency have a ** huge ** impact on a country 's economics system , you will understand how argentine came to ruin itself when it decided to use a huge overvalued currency when it pegged its peso to the dollar on a 1:1 ratio , that eventually led them to default etc. 
  you will understand how having the euro means that you are * de facto * emitting debt in a foreign , greatly overvalued currency that for economies such as italy are difficult to repay . 
  you will see how in the presence of a deficit , you only tools are only to : * emit debt * increase taxes as opposed to the other tool of simply emitting the quantity of currency you need . 
  you will see that what brought italy to be a g8 superpower was exactly that one economic system we had with the sovereign lira , exporting high quality goods and manufacturing , back then with the same ( even worse because we had craxi , other than berlusconi ) politicians . 
  if people took just a little time to read about some macroeconomics , and most of all to * understand * it , to which you must a good grasp on math , you will understand why economics nobel prize stigliz and the latest eocnomics nobel prize winner of 2016 criticize the euro as not being fit for all countries and actually being one of the main causes of economic stagnation of many european countries . 
  it is an extremely strong currency for our country and it makes difficult for us to export goods . 
  since the euro our economy is stagnating while prices have been going up all these years all coupled with very high unemployment rates . 
  of course i 'm not against euro * per se * , each country has its own economy , but euro is not suited to ours ( and some other european countries , greece comes to mind but it 's not the only one ) . 
  i think the sooner we leave the common currency area , the sooner we 'll have the chance to recover . 
  if i were to vote for it , i would undoubtedly vote out . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5l9lbt/tomorrow_january_1st_2017_marks_10_years_since/dbvatf2/ ), 
  romanians , as far as 2007 , were responsible for the highest number of crimes out of all foreigners , take a look at [ espresso ] ( http://espresso.repubblica.it/palazzo/2007/07/23/news/l-invasione-dei-romeni-1.4418 ) , one of the most prestigious investigative report italian magazines , ** left wing ** usually very politically correct . 
  but of course you ca n't argue with the crude numbers , math is a bitch . 
  nowadays if i 'm being correct romanians have been surpassed by other foreigners , but not because they are committing less crimes , only because with the new migrant 's wave there is more competition to the crime game . 
  i strongly hope that it does n't . 
  i 'll take your word for it , mafia is ours undoubtedly , only a fool would deny that . 
  now it 's your turn to admit what everyone in italy knows , that is not to say all romanians are criminals of course , but we 're experiencing a huge problem with it , and the official stats confirm that . 
  it might be reason of the next exit from the eu , but yeah , just pretend that it 's not true what everyone in europe knows . 
   more than half of the crimes are done by gypsies , therefore romanians do n't deserve to be tarnished and dragged in that top probably you 're right . 
  i was n't tarnishing anyone , i was just stating a fact . 
  i 've had both good and bad experience with romanian people . 
  it just seems that our shitty justice system seems to to attract mainly romanian criminals , the brain drain from romania goes elsewhere apparently . 
  it does that with everybody , including italy . 
  if the state does n't come up with a good plan of expenditure , the money is denied , and it happens all the time here too . 
  but it does n't change the fact that even if we got all the money we were entitled to , we 'd still be significant net givers . 
   yeah dude , everything bad happens in your country because of romania and bulgaria just read what i wrote , i never said ** all ** of our problems are caused by romania and bulgaria , and i do n't think think it either . 
  i 'm stating what everyone knows , if everyone took the time instead of downvoting without reason to go to our official statistics institute website , istat , you would find that romanians , while only being a minority of about 2000000 people in italy , comprise a very high percentage of prisoners , and that 's a fact . 
  you can evaluate the rate of criminality on those data and you 'll find that romanians have a much higher rate , only lower than moroccan . 
   romania and bulgaria , if anything , helped your economy . 
  you are ignorant considering that you do n't know that italy is the third contributor to the european budget , that is italy is a net * giver * to the eu while romanian gdp is growing with that fast rate because is net * receiver * . 
  probably you know very little math , otherwise you would comprehend how gdp works , that is the sum of income produced in the country or that flows in the country , so a very big chuck of your gdp is due to the generosity of germany , france and italy , all net givers . 
  about bulgaria , they are * not * a significant part of our crime rate , the problems , statistically speaking , come mainly in this order from nigerians , moroccans , romanians . 
  that 's only murders , and anyhow the majority of crimes committed by those people go unreported so official statistics are underestimated . 
  that 's when our crime stats literally skyrocketed with crimes committed by gypsies and not only them . 
   if the interests of the kremlin i hope you 're joking and you 're not buying the whole russophobia propaganda you see on the guardian . 
  good for them !, 
  marine le pen is nothing like her father , and yet i hear always the scaremongering from the press , personally i hope for france that she wins as she 'll finally do the interests of the french and not other people . 
  sharia is law , at least in the uk where sharia arbitrates are perfectly legal and in germany where a judge recently sentenced in favour of muslim police . 
  why do n't you take a look at what those numbers were just * before * putin during the 90s ? 
  you know , just for comparison , and you might be pleasantly surprised with putin 's governments .
