  this is bs , this is more accurate from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nations_and_intelligence#/media/file:national_iq_per_country_-_estimates_by_lynn_and_vanhanen_2006.png ) . 
  really ? 
  i did n't see that coming !, 
  this is the christmas time and those are lights so technically they still count . 
  romania can not into west . 
  fair point . 
  ahem ... you 're telling me that ? 
  i live in italy , we imported most of your gypsies ** in addition ** to the migrants . 
  i have so much respect now for you guys !, 
  you prove my point , you complain about them !, 
  now add to those the migrants and you 'll get the westerners ' perspective . 
  i agree , i 'm an euroskeptic and if the eu took care of those 2 things i would consider giving the eu a second chance . 
  you see westerners complaining about all of those things because we have to deal with it . 
  you do n't have millions of migrants who refuse to integrate in your country , who are causing lots of criminality and hate the country that 's welcoming them with its very generous welfare . 
  romania is still relatively homogeneous as a country , your only problem is with gypsies , and in fact you often complain about it . 
  once you get to experience our problems you 'll change your mind too . 
  i do n't know , i heard it on the news . 
  he was a refugee with a prior sexual crime record , so even if he was n't the terrorist he still had a pretty good c.v. for a refugee . 
   i have no clue whether his policies have had an effect or not . 
  i have : you just need to take a look at russia 's macroeconomics indicators to see how bad the situation was up until eltsin , and what changed during putin 's presidency , you ca n't argue with the numbers . 
  he inherited a country in ruins and completely changed the situation . 
  of course there a still many problems compared to some western nations , but the math involved does n't lie . 
  it 's too bad hearing all the time the same * hurr putin bad durr * without taking a look to the actual data . 
  and for the ones who are always there to compare poland with russia saying how much better is doing , well with all the billions of euros from the eu i would be surprised if poland did n't do good , it 's the country that takes the most from the eu budget . 
  i bet even russia would be much better with all that money . 
  romanian figures are being skewed by all the billions of euros it receives from the eu , russia until very recently had a gdp annual growth rate of up to 10 % and over 5 % without it being subsidized by eu money . 
  as an italian , yours is one of the cuisines we respect , and believe me , there are very few of them . 
  because in democracy unfortunately you change things through the public vote . 
  there 's some truth in both statements i think . 
  trichinella and echinococco are things of the past in farm raised pigs ( and other food animals ) because as i said before you ** must ** let a vet control your animals , otherwise it 's illegal and nobody does it because we know the dangers involved . 
  we take food safety very seriously in italy , trust me . 
  wild boars is another story , hunters will * always * cook them , never prepare sausages from them or salted meat , and they can not be sold to restaurants by italian law . 
  our asl ( local healthcare system ) is also in charge of the health issues of animals , pets or especially animals to slaughtered for human consumption . 
  well that 's ironic coming from a swiss guy whose country completely closed its borders and refused to take in any of the migrants . 
  maybe that 's the reason why you call me racist , you did n't have to witness all the problems these illegal immigrants are causing in our countries while you relax in your sofa without having to deal with it . 
  you 're not being an asshole , i actually appreciate it because english is not my first language and sometimes i 'm not sure if my sentences are correct or not , so it 's good i learned something new today !, 
  thanks, 
  pig parts , such as steaks , ribs etc , not whole pigs . 
  yes , that 's what they told soviets back then in the ussr when they censored uncomfortable news : that it was fake propaganda from the west . 
  funny how history usually repeats itself . 
   even for a loner nerdy guy ? 
   lol of course , sardinia , and many other parts of italy , luckily still has a pretty strong connection to the rural world , which means for example that we have our own olive trees , vegetable garden and chicken . 
  about 15 years ago my grandfather had also pigs , that we used to slaughter and prepare , it 's actually a festive occasion , it 's called * porchinadu * where usually the whole family helps prepare all the pig parts to make sausages , pancetta etc. 
  i 'm still a nerd though , and kinda of a `` lone wolf '' . 
  he was right about that though . 
  well i 'll give you that some countries , like poland , had a good transition between communism and market economy and is doing great !, 
  other ones immediately after the fall have actually become * poorer * , like romania ( which is recovering and i think it 's gon na grow a lot in these years ) and russia , where the 90s where absolutely awful . 
  now russia after 99-2000 have been experiencing a great economical growth , but it 's not been good for everyone from the start like poland . 
  oh thanks !, 
  this makes me so proud , yes porcheddu ( piglet ) is one of our typical dishes and it 's so good because local farmers do n't feed them shit , just natural food . 
  and the same applies for our cheeses , you happen to go to sardinia and want to taste/buy some , ask local people in the villages where you can buy it homemade , the supermarket ones are tasteless . 
  i 'm sorry that my opinion , politely explained , is hurting your feelings , but that 's your problem . 
  i do n't slaughter them because i feel sorry for them , but once they 're dead i have no problem cutting the carcass , it 's very common here and part of our tradition . 
  well i 'm just saying what i 've been told , that 's their opinion . 
   but its hardly the cause of every good thing after the ww2 . 
  i agree on this , clearly there were the conditions for germany ( and other european countries ) to become an economic power . 
  after all , africa is being given billions of $ and it 's still struggling . 
  actually i was told by a few people that lived during both soviet times and now that they miss it , and they were wealthier back then . 
  i 've been told the same from a few romanians about the ceausescu regime . 
  well i do n't know about other countries , but here in sardinia they are checked by vets , they receive the proper vaccines etc. 
  to be safe to eat , the law still applies to local farmers !, 
  we have a special police force , nas , whose job is to make sure that food is safe to eat , they do lab analysis etc. 
  yes by substituting german people with immigrants who do n't want to integrate and despise the very same country that 's welcoming them . 
  i think germans are smarter than that and wo n't fall for this idiocy . 
  as i said [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5izpyt/1982_market_in_poland/dbc8n1w/ ) , do n't be ashamed , they probably are way better than the fancy ones from the stores , at least that 's the rule where i live . 
  it still happens in sardinia and believe me , those pigs are * way * tastier than the ones you buy from the supermarket . 
  the ones from the supermarket have no taste at all , people usually prefer to spend more and buy them from local farmers . 
  germany was forgiven a great deal of its public debt after ww2 , and also some war reparations , too bad many people seem to forget that . 
  and about the marshall plan , germany was the country that benefited the most from it . 
  well in italy we do better than you , in many cases you can skip prison altogether . 
  i knew that too , this graph is plain wrong . 
  you 're right : the first contributor is germany , the second france and the third italy and we receive back much less than what we give . 
  meanwhile milan 's mayor sala ( democratic party , left wing ) is being investigated for perjury regarding his management of expo 2015 and nobody says anything . 
  talking about hypocrisy ... merkel who is secretely doing business with putin worth billions of euros building the north stream , wants to forbid the other eu states from doing the same by pushing for new sanctions . 
  ok even if i risk triggering some poles i 'll ask you a question anyway ... is russian similar to polish ? 
  because to my italian ears they sound pretty similar . 
  is there some mutual intelligibility like between spanish and italian ? 
  please do n't compare it to italy , we have probably the shittiest connections in europe . 
  this is also a cause , and yet on the importance scale is not even close to the currency matter . 
  by the way , before the current stronger ties with the eu , we had the possibility to negotiate our deals with foreign countries , including china which i believe in the long term is doing more harm than good to the eu . 
  if bruxelles does n't admit that all its error brought to brexit , the rise of the euroskeptics , it might lead to the dissolution of the eu , and yet it keeps doing the same thing over and over , including austerity . 
  einstein used to say : * insanity : doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results . 
  * i think this sums up what the eu is doing . 
  house prices have been going ** down ** in recent years , so that 's not really the main issue here . 
   we are way beyond the point where you can produce everything domestically . 
  this is absolutely true , italy was know for its exports and manufacturing and they 've been receding more and more in these 16 years . 
  our export of electronic devices shrunk by 75 % since euro . 
  the law of economics are quite clear however , with a newer and cheaper currency , exports and manufacturing will become economically appealing . 
  the sooner people will realize the effects a currency has on a country , the sooner we 'll get better . 
  it does n't really matter if you 're buying in your own country . 
  and the devaluation will happen almost instantaneously , after that it will stabilize . 
  and it 's actually a positive thing because it will push internal production given that foreign goods will be more expensive . 
  take a look at stiglitz 's work and italian macroeconomical data when we had the lira . 
  this is just nonsense . 
  we also had ( and probably still have ) one of the lowest private debts in europe , what are you talking about ? 
  what savings were we `` eroding '' ? 
   italy is already treated like garbage . 
  i can not understand why italians do n't care about this . 
  you do n't have to be in the eu . 
  you can leave and be fine outside .
