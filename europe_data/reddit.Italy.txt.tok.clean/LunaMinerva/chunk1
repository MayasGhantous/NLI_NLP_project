you have to go through the `` sciences '' route in high school . 
  so you 've got a bunch of highly creative people who have to scrape by at math and physics i can confirm it 's basically what happens here in italy as well . 
  to go into architecture you do n't need to have taken the `` science route '' in high school , but given that it 's the most popular choice even among people who do n't exactly love math ( it 's basically the most neutral choice , if you do n't want to bother with ancient greek ) , the creative ones among these `` i hate math '' - folks end up doing architecture quite efficiently . 
  that 's basically what high school kids end up doing , yeah . 
  but primary/middle school kids require some kind of closer surveillance , so they end up being assigned to a teacher who makes them do their homework or read or whatever . 
  unless your religion class was at the start or at the end of the school day , in which case you are allowed to come later or leave earlier . 
   in italy 's schools you automatically take the catholic subject i would n't say it 's opt-out rather than opt-in : when you - well , your parents - first apply to a school ( be it primary or middle or high school ) , you 're given a form where you 're asked to choose whether you want to attend religion education classes or not . 
  if you choose `` no '' the alternative might be some kind of `` assisted homework '' activity with a teacher for younger kids , or anything ranging from `` free study-time '' to `` let 's dick around with the other guys who do n't do religion '' for older kids ( it all boils down to the resources of the school in question and the time availability of teachers , basically ) . 
  and if the religion class happens to be at the very start or at the very end of your school day , you are allowed to come later/leave early . 
  or at least that was my experience and that of my peers . 
  i was hoping it had the same meaning as the italian ( or to be more precise , venetian ) `` mona '' - that is , `` pussy '' . 
  and not the meowing kind . 
   la mona interesting name , if it means what i think it means . 
   \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc cool name , you should keep a couple of helpings aside for / r/atheism . 
  well , cream and bacon is a sauce of its own ( without a proper name as far as i know ) . 
  and in the 80s it was hip to throw some vodka in the mix to add some flavour to the cream . 
   population and resources of a city-state eh , not really . 
  the `` referendum '' ( read : online poll where one could easily vote as many times as they wanted providing fake data , and the website was built and hosted by the referendum proponents ) was n't for venice only , but for the whole region it belongs to , veneto - its population is 8 million , give or take . 
  the foreign press probably kept talking about `` venice '' because the name was more recognisable than veneto . 
    activists say exactly . 
  probably their only sources are online polls and little else . 
  if we are to look at electoral results ( ca n't link because i 'm on my phone , but they can be found on wikipedia ) the couple of secessionist parties we have got a 5 % max together . 
  let me guess ... lake garda ? 
  that 's true , and sometimes they get hold of good stuff like downton abbey and so on . 
  that said , imported stuff notwithstanding , italian mediaset production are on average subpar , and those that had some quality went downhill in the past few years . 
  on the bright side of things , if it 's anything like his italian channels , tele cinqo should be broke right now , right ? 
  cheap re-reruns of the same old shit 24/7 and commercial breaks like woah ? 
  as in , cheeks actually touching or one of the two placing their lips on the other 's cheek ? 
  well , i 'm blind and mona , disregard my post . 
   and here i was wondering why i had never seen a white-on-purple sign in poland ... that would be cool . 
  about italy : while we do have white-on-brown signs , those are used to mark the borders of * comuni * ( municipalities ) . 
  the most frequent ones are the black-on-white signs , which indicate an urban area ( city , town or district ) unless you are in a motorway ( white-on-blue ) or highway ( white-on-green ) . 
  no , it would be 5 \u00b7 10 = 50 . 
  it 's introduced as a substitute for the x everyone is taught in elementary school , when variables get in the mix . 
  i was wondering , are the highlands completely uninhabited ? 
  what 's the town closest to the center of the island ? 
   first instance court -  to the court of appeals -  to the high court ( final instance ) yup , with the supreme court ( * corte di cassazione * ) only judging the application of law in the lower courts , and not the interpretation of facts . 
  cute dogs !, 
  it 's 13 years , from 6 to 19 ( assuming everything goes smooth and you do n't have to repeat a year ) ; 5 years of elementary/primary school , 3 of junior high , 5 of high school . 
  was n't it called marbella or something ? 
  understandable mistake , they would be almost identical if it were n't for the clothes - and it 's not like you can pick that level of detail from a coin . 
  nope , he 's on san marino 's . 
   during the later phase of the italian unification process in the 19th century , san marino served as a refuge for many people persecuted because of their support for unification . 
  in recognition of this support , giuseppe garibaldi accepted the wish of san marino not to be incorporated into the new italian state . 
  [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_marino#history ), 
  its origins are unclear , but according to some it does originate from hamburg ( see [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hamburger ) ) . 
  never heard anyone using amaretto for tiramis\u00f9 , but if someone likes it then why not ? 
   but since the origins will be discussed a lot with italians , frenchies and such ( flan , mazapan , crema catalana ) crema catalana 's origins are really a matter of debate ? 
  the answer is in its name !, 
  yeah , as far as i can tell the original recipe does n't call for rum ( or any other type of alcohol for that matter ) , but lots of people do use some kind of spirit ( rum or marsala ) together with coffee to dip the sponge fingers in . 
  personally i do n't like tiramis\u00f9 when there 's too much alcohol ( it becomes too similar to [ zuppa inglese ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zuppa_inglese ) ) , but i do use a spoonful of rum or coffee-flavoured liquor when diluting the coffee with a bit of milk ( it makes it more delicate , and in this way i do n't have to prepare more than two mokas of coffee ) . 
  yeah , i guess it 's shared between austria , trentino and sudtirol , and germany . 
  let 's just compromise and say it 's from the alps . 
  thank you , but i 'm afraid i have green eyes !, 
  hey , i did suggest using gluten-free ones !, 
  i do n't want anyone sent in hospital !, 
  :'( btw , it would be * she . 
  [ tiramis\u00f9 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/tiramisu_fanes.jpg ) !, 
  it 's soft , creamy and delicious , and adding coffee and cocoa powder to cream and sponge biscuits makes for a really tasty mix . 
  and it 's super-easy to make !, 
  it 's not wheat-free though , but i guess you could use gluten-free * savoiardi * or something like that . 
  and there 's also [ apfelstrudel ] ( http://blog.best-bookings.com/it/files/2012/04/vienna-show-dello-strudel.jpg ) ( * strudel di mele * where i live ) , but again it 's not wheat-free , even though it could be made gluten-free . 
  i 've also tried a [ cream and blackberries variation-of-strudel-but-not-quite ] ( http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/05/17/36/85/treccia-mochena.jpg ) , and it was breathtaking . 
  no , it was n't cross-country skiing , just `` regular '' skiing . 
  and mine is a second-hand account , but as far as my skiing-loving classmates told me ( it was an elective activity ) they had been really impressed by our teacher 's speed/coordination , given the ~ 35 year gap between them and her ' stocky build . 
  but we ended up discovering that she was a skiing-buff herself , so it might very well have been that her longer experience paid off . 
  my high school biology teacher had the same build as merkel and she owned my classmates ' asses when they went to some kind of skiing challenge , and they were athletic and 18 . 
  i feel the need to urge germans to stay away from skiing for a little while . 
  really similar in venetian : * g\u00f2 impiss\u00e0 el fogo * . 
   i 've been to countries where antibiotics are sold next to asperin . 
  out of curiosity , are these countries european/eu ? 
   the only alternative is that you have docs that do n't know about viruses , which should be impossible . 
  they do know , but being people , it wo n't be hard to find the jackass who prefers signing a prescription in 0.2 seconds to keep the hypochondriac with a simple cold quiet instead of spending 5 minutes explaining them why they do n't need antibiotics . 
  should their licence be revoked ? 
  yes , imho - on the other hand , it is n't simple to verify if they 're handing out superfluous prescriptions or legit ones , not least because they are n't technically doing anything wrong ( their licence says they can prescribe whatever they believe is fit , within law limits , and antibiotics are n't outlawed or anything ) . 
  / u/herra _ x is pulling shit out of his/her ass , even here in italy a doctor 's prescription is needed for antibiotics and * they can not be bought at the supermarket . 
  * ^ * i will go out on a limb and say that 's probably true for the whole of eu . 
  edit : ^ * there are some ipermarkets with a pharmacy inside , but they work the same as normal pharmacies and you still need a prescription for antibiotics and the like . 
   here you need to get a prescription from a doctor to get antibiotics . 
  it 's the same here . 
  if you manage to get antibiotics for something you do n't need them for it 's the doctor 's fault . 
  thank you . 
    in other contexts , the - la / - l\u00e4 ending is used to form a house name out of a given name ( matti -  mattila -- these house names have also often become surnames for the people living in the house ) i want to know more about house names : are they used to describe the physical place a certain person or family lives in or rather the family/relationships/ties within ( so something more subjective , i guess ) ? 
  is it a word you would use to say - i do n't know - `` tonight i slept at [ friend name ] 's / [ friend name ] l\u00e4 '' ? 
  or is it a locative case ? 
  does that - inen ( or is it - nen ? ), 
  suffix have any meaning ? 
  is it some retention of a patronimic form ( like , say , the swedish - son ) or something ? 
  i had n't detected your sarcasm . 
  disregard my comment . 
  why would that be ? 
  it 's in southern italy where simple past is the go-to past tense , and austria is closer to northern italy where present perfect is preferred . 
  italian who has studied latin here : i ca n't understand a word of spoken romanian . 
  written romanian is more approachable , but it still looks less familiar than , say , spanish or french . 
  ah yes , finnish-italian is an awesome combo for this kind of stuff . 
  other than the infamous ` katso merta ' , there 's also ` katso sukkia ' , ` minkki\u00e4 ' , ` kuloo ' , and my personal favourite , ` p\u00f6ll\u00f6 ' . 
  also , from your post above : ` panna ' means cream/sahne in italian . 
  barilla sells olive oil abroad ?!, 
  barilla sucks at making pasta ( by the way , try to find dececco or garofalo pasta if you can - more expensive , but holy hell is it better ) , let alone olive oil : i ca n't imagine how horrible a product they do n't even have the courage to sell here in italy is . 
  you know , you 're not the first one to point this out ; i do n't have first-hand experience because i have never tried nutella abroad , but maybe it has something to do with the place of production ?
