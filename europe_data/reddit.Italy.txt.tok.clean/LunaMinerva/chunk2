  i dunno , all jars i see here in italy are produced in piedmont and taste the same , but maybe ferrero has a plant outside italy and they use different ingredients or something ? 
  i have no idea . 
  nopenopenope , red sauce is incredibly bland unless it 's grandma-made . 
  if you had said rag\u00f9 i might have conceded that it retains some worth , but red sauce ? 
  no way , man . 
  carbonara is #ffff 00 , pus is #ccfb 5d . 
  carbonara , * inarguably * the best thing ever , is yellow . 
  hence , your argument is invalid . 
  not to mention saffron yellow = / = pus yellow . 
  but spaghetti allo scoglio do n't have saffron ( yellow stuff    white stuff ) nor meat .

  poland being mentioned in the italian anthem ( written in 1847 , in the middle of the unification of italy ) :  * gi\u00e0 l'aquila d'austria le penne ha perdute . 
  *  the austrian eagle has already lost its plumes . 
  the blood of italy and the polish blood it drank , along with the cossack , but it burned its heart . 
  it 's referencing the fact that both countries were struggling for independence from the austrian empire - and , in poland 's case , from russia ( `` the cossack '' ) . 
  *  march , march , d\u0105browski , from the italian land to poland . 
  under your command we shall rejoin the nation . 
  the polish anthem was written in 1797 by a polish soldier ( the d\u0105browski mentioned in the stanza above ) of the polish legion led by napoleon during the italian campaign of the french revolutionary wars . 
  the guy wrote the anthem while in italy , and he mentions it when talking about going back to poland to fight and unite the country , at the time divided between russia and austria . 
  i know . 
  what i was wondering is , is there some kind of relation between the words `` night '' and `` eight '' that explains their similar sounds in most indo-european languages ? 
  is there a reason for this ? 
  or is it just a cool coincidence ? 
  and italy is mentioned in the polish anthem !, 
  as far as i know there are at least two sammarinese redditors lurking on / r/polandball ; it would be cool if they could provide some inside .

  1.620 , in downtown padova . 
  heh , almost . 
  :p but honestly , the prices have somewhat winded down in the past few months : now a liter of petrol is 1.6-1 .7 $ , but it used to be 1.8-1 .9 $ this spring , and last year in some places it went over 2 $ . 
  it can be quite crazy ( and annoying ) , but it does have some positive aspects , if it leads people to use their cars a bit less . 
  yeah , and the same goes for automated gas stations . 
  a pain in the ass when you have to fill your moped , when it does n't hold 10 $ worth of petrol . 
  actually , the sex-with-minor part of the trial is the least important , despite being the most talked about . 
  the real scandal of the `` rubygate '' is berlusconi 's malfeasance , having used his position of authority ( he was prime minister at the time ) and a whole deal of blatant lies ( `` the girl is mubarak 's niece , we 're risking an international scandal '' ) to make the police agents do what he wanted ( namely , securing ruby - who was in police custody - to one of his `` girls '' , who of course was in no position to do such a thing ) . 
  either way you 're right , it 's * paying * for sex with a minor that got him into trouble . 
  piazza dei miracoli - which is basically what 99 % of tourists limit themselves to in pisa - seriously feels like something artificial like a park attraction ; the monuments are beautiful , but the setting around them is eery in its ` tourist-trappiness ' . 
  the only things i would dry up by hand right after washing are glasses from the `` good set '' ~ ~ you ~ ~ your grandmother would put in display in her glass cupboard in the dining room . 
  in order to avoid spots . 
  or if you need a glass/dish right away . 
  for anything else , the dish-drying cupboard someone else mentioned is a gift from heaven . 
  dude , it 's zucchini flowers we 're talking about here !, 
  their flavour has nothing to do with that of zucchini ( trust me , i 'm no zucchini fan either ) , and deep fried zucchini flowers are nothing short of awesome ... give them a try !, 
  french is a romance language as well , though . 
  he 's a troll , do n't bother . 
  do you have good articles on the matter i can document on ? 
  i was too young at the time and ca n't remember . 
  that could be argued about all of them ; hell , just saying , monti was his direct opponent only 6 months ago . 
  that said , i trust ( and napolitano does as well , or else he would n't have appointed them ) their neutrality : they 're perfectly aware of the position they 're in and they know it mostly has a symbolical role . 
  edit : tl ; dr - if i were berlusconi i would be worried about more pressing matters , but we all know he 's putting up his usual ` teatrino ' . 
  yes , they can . 
  but for obvious reasons they usually choose not to , especially on touchy matters . 
  also they ca n't be more than five ( out of 317 senators , and not counting ex presidents of the republic who , after their mandate , are senators for life * de jure * ) , so it 's not like they can have such a huge impact - assuming they would vote the same , that is . 
  by the way , that 's exactly what berlusconi is assuming and worrying about , because he believes the 4 new senators are all left-leaning , when the truth is none of them has existing political links . 
  not quite . 
  assuming the knighthood you 're talking of is akin to the order of the british empire , its direct italian equivalent is the [ order of merit of the italian republic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/order_of_merit_of_the_italian_republic ) - both knighthoods grant no political role , and there 's no limit to the number of knights appointed . 
  on the other hand senators for life are full-on members of the senate and have the same rights of a ` regular ' , elected senator ; * de facto * , though , they only take part to the vote in special occasions . 
  also , there can be a maximum of 5 senators for life at a time , but you 'll find more on that [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/senator_for_life#italy ) . 
  they were appointed `` senators for life '' for their merits in the fields of art and science by the president of the republic ( just like the late levi montalcini ) ; it 's a honorary position , on paper they can vote in the senate but they usually choose to keep a low profile and only take part in special votations and such . 
  exactly . 
  someone above was talking about the alleged `` southern lifestyle '' as being a pr move : it is , but here 's the catch - we 're not the ones ` promoting ' it , it 's the rest of the world who , for some reason , likes to believe it 's the norm . 
  case in point : you ca n't find a guardian article about italy where ` la dolce vita ' is n't randomly mentioned , basically every american movie set in italy is a pasta/pizza/mandolino stereotype-fest , and many tourists are actually disappointed when they discover that no , we do n't spend our days in the countryside making olive oil and enjoying life , but live in sometimes gloomy cities trying to make ends meet . 
  tourists simply get sold what they want to see ( 100 $ for a short gondola ride in venice , lolwut ) - if they wanted to see real 2013 italy , they would only have to get rid of their romanticized view of the country . 
   this is not applicable to paper , trees being a renewable resource . 
  yes and no . 
  it depends on the quantity that gets cut down and then replaced in regards to a certain tree growth rate . 
  let 's say you have a forest of 1000 trees and you cut down 10 of them every day , while replacing them with young ones . 
  this means that after 100 days your supply has ( momentarily ) ended - unless the 10 trees that were replanted first are now big enough to be cut down again ( they 're not ) . 
  think in years instead of days and yes , your forest can be considered a renewable resource . 
  so in the end it all depends on the sustainability of this process - as far as i know , not many countries respect it . 
  ~ ~ man , i love ` the line ' - it 's incredible how you can make a funny sketch that also makes sense by using only a line . ~ ~ ~ ~ it 's also impressive how he never fossilized on a particular drawing style and keeps changing it . ~ ~ edit : nope , apparently the line was created by the late osvaldo cavandoli . 
  for some reason i 'd always thought it was a bozzetto creation . 
   citt\u00e1 del vaticano it 's * citt\u00e0 del vaticano * with a grave accent and not an acute one , but i 'm nitpicking . 
  yeah , it 's portogallo in italian - i did n't know we were the only ones to change it , though . 
  til . 
  no , but they never miss the chance to randomly mention berlusconi , which is just as annoying . 
  and honestly , it 's been a while since i last saw hitler being mentioned when talking about germany in * serious * news articles - comments of trolls notwithstanding . 
   further evidence the number is bullshit : central pisa has only 88k residents , with 200k in the metro area . 
  the thing is , you 're assuming only people from the province of pisa are applying ; florence , siena and lucca are all a hour away by car , and commuting to these extents is certainly not uncommon around here . 
  moreover , it 's not unlikely people outside tuscany are willing to move there for working reasons - some time ago there 'd been a similar situation for a certain number of nursing positions in a big city like rome or milan , and applicants had come from everywhere in italy . 
  if i find a source in english i 'll post it . 
  i reciprocate by having 9 german coins out of the 15 in my wallet ; the others are italian ( 3 ) , french ( 1 ) , spanish ( 1 ) and finnish ( 1 ) . 
  oh , and a random polish zloty . 
  do you still have the banknote with the pink/purple see-through patches ? 
  i completely agree , but i think liaisons_dangereuses 's point was that other nations are n't in the position to be patronizing towards us like they 've been in the past few days . 
  to put things in perspective , [ here ] ( http://geocurrents.info/cultural-geography/the-rapid-rise-of-the-xenophobic-right-in-contemporary-europe ) 's a recent article where the rise and size of the xenophobic right in europe is discussed . 
  and seeing the numbers mentioned , i really do n't see how italy is more racist than most european countries . 
  of course , xenophobia is not exclusive to the right and simply looking at the votes the right receives ( without taking into consideration the differences among these parties , for starters ) can only lead to a limited vision of the current situation , but i believe it can still be a starting point . 
  edit : dear downvoters , i 'm more than happy to discuss this . 
  do n't be shy and bring up your reasons . 
  again , the perpetrator is allegedly a member of a far-right xenophobic and fascist party , forza nuova , which never got more than 0,5 % of votes and never managed to get any seats in the parliament . 
  representatives of all other parties , including the anti-immigration lega nord , condemned the gesture . 
  so no , i would n't really judge 60 million people from the dumb gesture of a single idiot . 
  this does n't mean there are no racist italians whatsoever , of course - but i believe it 's a phenomenon whose size is comparable to that of other european countries .
