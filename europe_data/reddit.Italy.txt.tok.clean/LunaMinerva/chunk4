  i liked his mickey . 
  and now that i started thinking disney-artists , i also remember romano scarpa . 
  haha , i knew you were a finn when i saw this ( i 'm using a reddit client on my phone and ca n't see flairs ) !, 
  you guys are really into disney comics , and i could n't imagine anyone else - with the possible exception of a dane - knowing scarpa outside italy 's * topolino * fanbase . 
  i 'm deeply sorry but i ca n't abstain from correcting this :  freddie mercury ftfy, 
  i was curious to know which criteria were followed to create this map , and according to [ their website ] ( http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/guide_europe/country_by_country/ ) ( for each country you can download a . pdf infographic where the rating is explained ) italy 's score is low due to our lack of laws against discrimination and hate speech/crime - other than the lack of family recognition , but that 's under the sun . 
  so yeah , i would n't really blame the vatican on this one - even though there 's plenty of mps with strong links within the church ( just google * comunione e liberazione * ) , who have opposed past law proposals against homophobia . 
   ( and i * still * have n't seen x = 200 in real life ) what , seriously ?!, 
  wow , this says a lot about the negligible quantity of 200 $ bills around - i 've seen 5 or 6 of them in 11 years . 
  i 'd love to know why they 're so few . 
  upvoted for douglas adams reference . 
   a resignation is not impossible according to the constitution , but as far as i know it never happened before , thus i feel it might be unlikely . 
  if i remember correctly leone , pertini 's predecessor , resigned 6 months before the natural end of his mandate , following aldo moro 's assassination . 
   this german soap show ( i think it 's called sturm der liebe , or something ) haha , you get those as well ? 
  my mum is crazy about them . 
  until a bunch of years ago all soap operas were south american , now they 're all german - is this part of austerity or something ? 
  :d one of those had an old landlady and an old butler who kept bickering , they were hilarious to watch while i was having lunch . 
   is there any chance of the president using his emergency powers to dissolve parliament and call new elections ? 
  the guy 's 7 year long mandate ends in a couple of weeks , he 's in the middle of the so called `` white semester '' and ca n't dissolve the parliament - he has already done what he could do . 
   regardless of where they stand left or right , or where the chips fall , to let the masses decide a course once and for all rather it be ruled and altered by games of politics . 
  you do n't have to agree with the comedian 's policies , the people that voted for him do n't even have to side with his other policies , other than to let the people decide once and for all rather than the to and fro . 
  this is exactly why lots of people , both left - and right-wing , voted for grillo : the majority of his voters did n't ( and , to a certain extent , still do n't ) have a clue what his policies were ( some of those are laughable to begin with ) , but chose him because they want to see a radical change in italian politics and have their voice heard . 
  is this really going to happen thanks to grillo ? 
  eh , i 'm doubtful . 
  i 'd also add [ argo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argos_ ( dog ) for dogs ; it 's not quite as ` stereotypical ' as fido , but it 's rather popular . 
  and cute , might i add . 
  haha , it 's almost the same in venetian : `` coa carne de vaca no se more de fame '' . 
  i 'd be rather curious to read something written by him . 
  i 'm not sure what croatia 's ranking is , but the list that was posted is supposed to be in alphabetical order . 
  it also means ` light ' in latin . 
  no , we do it as well . 
  what gives germans away is the sandals + socks combo . 
  seen that ? 
  i 'm already learning the language !, 
  i hope so . 
  unfortunately ( i voted for vendola ) , that is n't even near enough to reach an unstable majority , let alone a solid one . 
  siding with monti is the lesser evil right now , at least as far as i 'm concerned . 
  not for a long government , mind you , but to keep this going until the electoral law is changed , or something . 
  ( in veneto dove ? ), 
  you do n't have to be sorry , it was not up to you to vote . 
  goddamn , it 's times like this i fucking hate my country . 
  according to an unsourced rumor that is spreading right now , bersani wants to resign but they 're telling him to wait before doing anything . 
  anyway , a name i 'd throw in is renzi , bersani 's opponent at the primary election held in autumn , but that 's just speculation . 
  no , a bersani-monti coalition is one of the possibilities , but we 'll have to see the final results to speculate more on that . 
  it 's a bersani-monti-grillo coalition that 's impossible - it 's a compromise grillo wo n't even consider , and under certain aspects his agenda is somewhat closer to berlusconi 's rather than bersani 's or monti 's . 
  yeah , it 's a shitty situation . 
  way shittier than expected . 
  where do i sign ? 
  germans , i beg you : ca n't you guys do an anschluss 2.0 and invade us ? 
  save us from ourselves . 
  you can get an idea on how italian public opinion is divided by looking at the numbers of this election : * out of all italians over 18 , 20-25 % of them will abstain from voting : these are the people who believe that none of the eligible parties deserves their vote . 
  they do n't think their vote can make a difference . 
  * among voters , 35 % are voting for bersani and vendola and 7 % for monti - putting them together , they 're the ~ 30 % of italians : these are the people who realize ( and probably have always realized ) that the situation italy is in is dire ( and thus are aware of the pervasive corruption and so on ) , and do n't want berlusconi back , whether they 're left-leaning or centre/right-leaning . 
  they also believe populism is not a solution . 
  * then we have 30 % voting for berlusconi and allies ( basically the northern league ) - ~ 25 % of all italians : they 're either people who would benefit from berlusconi 's laissez-faire tenure , strongly against heavy taxations ( especially if rich ) , strongly against any kind of left-leaning party or clueless senior citizens . 
  either way , they put forward their own interests and not those of the whole country . 
  * 20 % will vote for grillo 's `` fuck 'em all '' movement - ~ 15 % of italians : these are people who have had enough of not only berlusconi , but also monti 's austerity and the left 's weakness . 
  half of them are ex-left voters , half of them ex-berlusconi voters . 
  prone to populism . 
  it 's hard to know what their stance on corruption is , since so far they have focused on lesser issues . 
  and remember that corruption is not a problem brought by berlusconi : it has been plaguing italy since at least the second half of the 19th century . 
  it 's probably borderline , like most of the stuff he does . 
  according to a piece of news i saw yesterday there 's an investigation going on , though . 
  ( [ here 's ] ( http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/elezioni2013/news/2013/02/22/imu-fascicolo-procura-lettera-cav-svizzera-tempi-lunghi-accordo-fiscale_8293804.html ) the article in italian , for those interested ) . 
  have you read my comment in its entirety ? 
  i said i blame berlusconism , which , at least as far i 'm concerned , includes not only the political right of the past 20 years , but also the influence it has had on the country as a whole - and that includes the left and centre-left of the past two decades . 
  i ca n't agree more . 
  i once read an article whose main point was that culture as a whole belongs and has always belonged to the ( italian ) left , and that the right could n't produce anything of a cultural value because of its core beliefs . 
  well , no , it 's not the right that ca n't produce culture ( i mean , just think of the * destra storica * ) , it 's fucking berlusconism . 
   ( sorry , i just watched grillo filling up piazza del popolo and i 'm shitting myself ) i feel your pain . 
  among his followers i see not only people , uh , weak against populism , but graduates and so on , and i really ca n't wrap my mind around the idea that they * actually * believe in grillo 's `` aria fritta '' . 
  sigh . 
  another key factor to consider is berlusconi 's ability to gain consensus among the most naive part of the country : older people , especially the least educated ( they 're so many they can make a difference ) . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.agi.it/uploads/newson/i9/k5/i9k5onjeofu4ap1oo12dyg/img1024-700_dettaglio2_big_lettera-berlusconi-su-imu.jpg ) is the letter most italians have found in their mailbox in the past few days : the words you see on the envelope are `` important notice '' and `` imu 2012 refund '' ( imu is a property tax introduced last year by monti and which had quite an impact on lower income families - you have to remember that the majority of italians own the house they live in ) . 
  well , it was just electoral spam from berlusconi , but the way the letter was written led lots of clueless senior citizens into believing they were miraculously getting their tax money back thanks to him , and some of them flocked to postal offices and so on asking for alleged `` imu refund forms '' to fill in order to get their cash back . 
  not to mention the huge amount of blatant lies he blurts out daily ; even setting aside the poor and naive 80 years olds , there 's still a lot of people who refuse to see the truth . 
  i honestly do n't know how you could change their minds . 
  yes , but italian = / = berlusconi voter . 
  i must admit the two categories overlap more than i like , though . 
  this . 
  i know a fair amount of people who say : `` yeah , berlusconi 's a dick , but who else is there i can vote for ? 
  there 's no way in hell i 'm voting for those fucking commies ! '' . 
  it 's usually the kind of people you ca n't discuss politics with , because after a moment they blurt out a `` damn politicians , they 're all thieves ! '', 
  and try to change subject . 
  some of them are now voting for grillo , and i 'm just as worried . 
  i should 've been clearer , i was referring to the second panel . 
  german , because it sounds badass ; finnish , because it looks cool ; icelandic , because eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull . 
  i ask for the help of my fellow italians : what the hell are # 3 and especially # 8 ? 
  never seen them . 
  that world be the ` coperto ' . 
  i 've always assumed it covers the dishes and forks you 're given . 
  he said balotelli is a `` mela marcia '' ( `` rotten apple '' ) a week before buying him for ac milan ( in order to gain political consensus among milan supporters - yes , some people are * that * shallow ) . 
  ~ ~ so yes , berlusconi is still the usual dick , but he never used the word `` nigger '' , at least in public . ~ ~ edit : my bad , i thought the article was referring to * silvio * berlusconi 's remarks , not his brother 's ( who * did * use the word `` nigger '' ) . 
  to put this simply , berlusconi . 
  it 's * his * party , that 's never gon na happen . 
  and by `` his '' i mean that he 's not only the founder , but also the main ( actually , the only ) mind behind their agenda : most of the members of pdl are berlusconi 's puppets or in it to protect their own interests . 
  the few who could actually think independently have already left and created their own party , or are now supporting monti . 
  without berlusconi the people of freedom party would n't exist ; proof of this claim is the fact that before his return pdl kept getting < 12 % of the votes , while now it 's around 25 % . 
  it 's all about him , and not the party ( and unfortunately that 's true of many other italian parties - it 's one of the many flaws of italian politics , if you will ; one of the few exceptions is the democratic party ) . 
  edit : by `` agenda '' i mean `` ways to protect berlusconi and his industrial empire from trials / ` communist judges ' / taxes/whatever '' , but that goes without saying .
