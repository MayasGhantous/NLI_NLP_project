   source : i 'm studying in the uk right now , and most of my co-students have * zero * clue how to do the most basic stuff , like do laundry , cook , and especially clean . 
  that 's because when they were teenagers their parents never had them help with house chores and let them play videogames or whatever the whole time . 
  i live with my parents and yet i can do all of those things on my own ( granted , i ca n't cook as well as my mum but i 'm getting there ! ), 
  - and so do most of my friends , who are in the same situation . 
  we may live with our parents , but that does n't mean we do n't help around the house . 
  hell , even middle school kids are supposed to help with dishes or something !, 
  that said , spoilt kids ( and , as a consequence , adults ) can be found everywhere . 
   in comparison the wage for a newly graduated student of political science working in the public sector is about 4-5 .000 euros a month . 
  holy fucking hell , that 's what a seasoned doctor makes in a month here !, 
  what awaits a political science graduate is unemployment , or a short-term contract to work as a cashier at the supermarket if they 're lucky . 
  not everyone does this , but yes , i know some siblings who share a duplex with their respective families - it 's never a single big house , though . 
  italian here - yes . 
  i ca n't provide a source because i 'm using my mobile right now , but if i remember correctly we have one of the lowest renting ratios in europe ( it 's something like , 25-30 % live in a rented house and 75-70 % live in their property house ) , and that 's a cultural thing . 
  there are of course differences between big cities and the countryside , and the trend seems to be changing nowadays , with the crisis and whatnot - that said , though , it 's still widely believed that not having to pay a rent to a third party means your economic situation is stronger and more solid . 
  yeah , same here ( italy ) . 
  state allowances are limited to * very * good students and even then they only cover tuition fees . 
  the same goes for lower income people : they have lower tuition , but that 's it . 
  if a student wants to go living on his/her own , they have to cover : food , housing ( housing provided by the university is very limited and not free , even if cheaper than private housing ) , tuition and books , various bills ( electricity , etc ) and extras . 
  that means at least 600/700 $ per month , and the most a student with a part-time job can make is ~ 300 $ - doing this without the help of your parents is close to impossible , and those who manage to do it inevitably end up graduating 1 or 2 years later . 
  that 's why people who study in the city they live in do n't move out of their parents ' house - it 's not wanting to depend on them endlessly , it 's about saving money . 
  i think you have a point , to be honest i had n't noticed it was kg/person rather than litres/person . 
  that said i reckon there are differences in caffeine between different types of coffee beans - i 'm no expert , though . 
  it would be interesting to see how a map based on caffeine assumption rather than coffee consumption would compare to this one , given that there are vastly different coffee-based drinks worldwide . 
  and verga 's * i malavoglia * . 
  here in italy it was a thing until 20ish years ago , especially in rural areas . 
  some people older than 60 still do it for their gp . 
  the gift would be anything from a bottle of wine to a basket full of goods , depending on the wealth of the family . 
  baskets were/are also given to other professional figures ( the lawyer , the accountant , etc ) , or exchanged between business partners or whatever . 
  i 'm not sure to which extent this is done nowadays . 
  woah , that was much more detailed than i expected !, 
  thanks !, 
  ok , after the nth time i see this thing coming up between austrians , i have to ask : what 's wrong with carinthia ? 
   all i * do * know is that there is both a mario * and * a luigi involved . 
  which makes me happy . 
  well , that would actually be * pier luigi * , but i do n't want to break your bubble !, 
  i do it as well - put it into the oven for a couple of minutes and it 's basically just as good as it was when it was bought . 
  same here !, 
  in northeastern italy we call it * vin brul\u00e8 * . 
  yeah , same here : i 've only ever heard about huge amounts of coffee and redbull , but nothing else . 
  ** italy ** ( well , northern italy ; southern italians are generally more open ) ** strangers ** : handshakes . 
  ** relatives ** : kisses on cheeks , or more often some kind of cheek-to-cheek peck . 
  now that i think of it , i 've only seen mouth-to-cheek kisses when children are involved . 
  ** friends ** : it depends . 
  i know some girls who do the cheek-to-cheek routine even if they see each other everyday and it gets on my nerves . 
  among guys i 've seen the pat on the shoulder , especially if they have n't seen each other for a while . 
  ** business partners ** : handshakes . 
  ** men + women ** : if they know each other , a cheek-to-cheek and/or hug is likely . 
  ** women + women ** : same as above . 
  ** men + men ** : handshakes , half-hugs , similar stuff . 
  ** how many kisses ? 
  ** : two , one for each cheek . 
  or even three , among younger people . 
  ** after how much time of not seeing each other ? 
  ** : as i mentioned above , it depends on the people involved . 
  as far as i 'm concerned i reserve kisses for special occasions or for relatives/friends i have n't seen for * a long * time . 
  * [ france ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_france#r.c3.a9gions_economy ) : according to wikipedia , the disparity between different regions seems to be less noticeable if compared to other european countries . 
  that said , \u00cele-de-france , the richest region in france ( and in the eu ) has a gdp per capita which is more than twice that of the poorest region , picardy ( $ 51.100 and $ 22.900 respectively ) . 
  * [ poland ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poland#economy ) : ca n't find data on the differences in gdp between different voivodeships and districts , but apparently the median wage in lubin county ( $ 1.400 , lower silesian voivodeship ) is almost three times the median wage in k\u0119pno county ( $ 520 , greater poland voivodeship ) . 
  * [ italy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_italy#regional_economic_differences ) : northwestern italy - trentino alto adige-s\u00fcdtirol and lombardy in particular - has the highest gdp in the country ( $ 29.300 per capita ) , whereas southern italy has the lowest ( $ 16.500 per capita ) . 
  * [ united kingdom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_united_kingdom#regional_variations ) : the richest county is greater london ( with a [ gva ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gross_value_added ) per capita of # 34.200 ) , whereas the lowest gva is cornwall 's . 
  considering the four countries , england is the richest ( # 20.450 ) and wales is the poorest ( # 14.850 ) . 
  what about san marino ? 
  a kidney stone that just lies there and never gives you any pain , so you often forget of its existence ? 
  for the sake of completeness i want to add something to what blue1 _ has already said : according to the latest polls berlusconi 's party ( with a consensus of 15 % ) is way behind the main centre-left party ( over 30 % ) and even beppe grillo 's ` movement ' ( at 17 % ) . 
  from berlusconi 's standpoint having elections sooner rather than later and with the current electoral law would grant an unwanted bonus to the opposition , so it 's really hard to understand where he 's coming from or what he 's planning . 
  that said , i do n't think he stands a chance to win - no matter what trick he 's hiding under the sleeve this time . 
  yeah , that was my line of reasoning . 
  they 're even obliged to bring a rifle whenever they leave the town !, 
  cloudy/rainy here , but the temperatures are warmer . 
  i fucking hate clouds , as long as it 's sunny ^ * i do n't mind cold . 
  ^ * ^ well , ^ tomorrow . 
  ^ `` sunset '' ^ here ^ was ^ 3 ^ hours ^ ago . 
  i 'd kill to be in troms\u00f8 right now , i 'd love a trip to svalbard !, 
  even though it 's not the best time of the year to do so , is n't it ? 
  probably there are n't even scheduled flights right now . 
  in our system teamwork and discussion are ( almost ) nowhere to be found and we still perform poorly in the pisa . 
  * in media stat virtus * , apparently . 
  i 'm actually surprised to see norway doing so bad : what 's the deal ? 
  i was under the impression that the quality of their education system was akin to that of the other nordic countries . 
  canada and denmark as well , iirc . 
  according to this [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blocking_of_youtube_videos_in_germany ) , gema ( gesellschaft f\u00fcr musikalische auff\u00fchrungs - und mechanische vervielf\u00e4ltigungsrechte ) - a german performance rights organisation - wanted youtube to pay them a .12 $ fee per streamed video ( gema representatives say they asked for .01 $ , though ) . 
  anyway , google/youtube refused . 
  a dispute on the royalties surfaced and now they 're waiting for the ruling of a california court , after a german one ruled in favor of gema . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blocking_of_youtube_videos_in_germany ) 's the wikipedia article on the subject . 
  [ relevant story ] ( http://obscurityandbeyond.blogspot.it/2010/02/lost-movie-detective-him-1974.html ) ( and [ its wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/him_%28film%29 ) ) . 
  apparently in 1974 a gay porn movie about jesus , titled * him * , was made , and according to newspaper ads of the time it received a very limited run in an obscure and low-key new york theatre - only to be completely lost , and now it 's one of the most sought after ` missing movies ' . 
  [ behold the most unsettling projection of them all !, 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/merctransph.png/300px-merctransph.png ) it 's a spherical transverse mercator , for those who are wondering . 
  no , you 're completely right : in reality greenland is just slightly larger than mexico . 
  nah , they were having a terrible argument on what to put in the pasta sauce - it 's serious business here . 
  til michele ferrero , the owner of the brand , is [ italy 's richest person ] ( http://www.rich-bastards.com/country-italy.htm ) ( and [ the sixth in europe ] ( http://www.poptens.com/2012/06/23/richest-people-in-europe/ ) ) , with a net of $ 19 billion - to put this into perspective , berlusconi is ` only ' sixth ( $ 5.9 billion ) . 
  it 's a wonder he never tried to run for prime minister . 
  and still no [ kinder eggs for the usa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kinder_eggs#prohibition_on_sale_or_import_into_the_united_states ) . 
  sorry , guys !, 
  it 's hard to explain , but no . 
  the problem lies in the lighter shades of color . 
  a good example might be the 3/8 ishihara test : a normal person sees an 8 , a color bind one sees a 3 - this is because the right side of the 8 has more contrast than the left side , and for color blind people it 's harder to discern the difference between the two colors when it 's not heavy , especially when you 're looking at the picture as a whole . 
  i can still tell if a single spot is pink or light green , but the two colors are closer to me than they are for a normal person . 
  i 'm a she , by the way . 
  quite the rarity , but not impossible - my father has the same problem and my mother must be heterozygote for it .
