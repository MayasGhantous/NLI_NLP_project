  plot twist : poles around europe all voted for poland which reaches the top . 
  guys , i 'm biased when i say italy is good but i 'm sure it 's better than sweden . 
  and i usually love the swedish entries , just not this . 
  i can honestly say , i 'm surprised by these votes . 
  portugal , i love you , but i 'm starting to hate you . 
  sincerely , an italian . 
  it 's really hard to believe the moldovan jury thought an ironic song about yodel was better than portugal , italy and bulgarian . 
  certain votes are a joke . 
  god , who the fuck choose the juries . 
  her and her song . 
  both beautiful . 
  i had 2 valid reasons to vote for france so i have voted for france . 
  verka serduchka , biggest ukrainian export !, 
  i do n't mind this commercial pause . 
  that was in 2015, 
  the romanian entry is that song you show americans to explain what eurovision is . 
  united kingdom giving us a song , i 'm impressed !, 
  little reminder : if your favourite does n't win it 's not due to politics but because people like different things . 
  finland got robbed , their perfomance was flawless each time , azerbaijan and cyprus are not even slightly comparable to them . 
  finland is great too , will vote that . 
  we need a drinking game bingo for the show like : * take a shot everytime the hosts speak french * take a shot when the song is about love * drink when a host makes a bad joke * drink when a person with a flag gets captured on cameras * drink when the song is in the singer 's native language, 
  i think a good start to depoliticise the eurovision song contest would have been not sending a person that broke the hosting country 's law , would n't it ? 
  who did n't see this coming ? 
  it was obvious this would have happened . 
  could you also name the painters ? 
  it was the first italian to swim 100 meters in less than 1 minute !,

  [ removed ], 
  why is / r/europe mexican ? 
  dialects : 1 . 
  singaporean 2 . 
  american ( standard ) 3 . 
  us black vernacular / ebonics native language : 1 . 
  romanian 2 . 
  italian i can see why they thought i 'm a native romanian speaker but i do n't get vietnamese lol . 
  i wanted to write the same about romania , r/europe totally changed my view about it but about almost every country to be honest . 
  it made me realize that there 's no really a perfect place in the world and that each country has its problems , it totally killed my `` the grass is greener '' perspective that is really popular in italy . 
  quite often . 
  in sardinia there are a lot of people who speak both italian and understand/speak sardinian or other minor languages , especially people from small towns . 
  if you try it , it 's not disgusting at all . 
  i have had it before and its flavour is really good . 
  passera - female sparrow topa - female mouse cinciallegra - big tit, 
  we also call our flag in that way , is called `` il tricolore '' . 
  thank you for exposing me to this , i 'm crying . 
   it can be tough to take in at times but as a christian we need to trust god 's plan in all things and remember that he takes the bad and turns it into good . 
  amen . 
  lithuania , estonia , the netherlands and sweden . 
  `` amico '' that simply means `` friend '' . 
  nothing extraordinary . 
  a woman on r/italy got tattoed `` fuck cancer '' in italian on her back but instead of writing a good translation she got herself a misspelled phrase . 
  `` fuck cancer '' in italian is `` fanculo il cancro '' but she got `` cazzo granchio '' that means `` dick crab '' . 
  her brother made the post and if i 'm right he deleted it afterwards . 
  [ fabio rovazzi ] ( https://youtu.be/kifn_wvgrem ) . 
  he 's a youtuber/comic `` rapper '' that makes silly songs . 
  i love coldplay but i can see why some people dislike them , their music can be both boring or relaxing . 
  indeed i 'm subscribed to it even if i do n't understand swedish , but you know , memes . 
  it needs more shitposting . 
   i always been angry had , that you the verb at the end put have to . 
  that 's what they do in sardinia with italian . 
  each country has a different history and culture and especially the us and canada have some very interesting pasts . 
  nature , as other people said , is one the reasons why many tourists are amazed by these countries but i think that most people are fascinated by the image american shows , mostly , give to the general public of themselves . 
  especially cities like new york are depicted as marvellous and immense and everybody wants to breathe that air of big city in constant movement . 
  i have never understood why it 's the dream city of several people , it 's not like i do n't find it a nice city but it 's not even my dream to go there , may be the reason how it was built , its importance as an economic center , i do n't know , it prpbably just looks majestic and there 's nothing similar to it . 
  while european capitals are all very old , cities like toronto and nyc are more recent , more modern and have another beauty . 
  it 's one of the most important cities though . 
  not at the same level of the most famous ones but it 's not unknown , it 's also the homeland of some important figures like the poet and novelist [ umberto saba ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/umberto_saba ), 
  some random pop artists, 
  a bit old : * [ lunapop - qualcosa di grande ] ( https://youtu.be/04cq9lz_btm ) * [ daniele silvestri - salir\u00f2 ] ( https://youtu.be/sh_xyi_edmc ) * [ elisa - luce ] ( https://youtu.be/0h0q_akbg4i ) released recently : * [ cosmo - l'ultima festa ] ( https://youtu.be/o1u681dt3pe ) * [ willie peyote - c'era una vodka ] ( https://youtu.be/bhudkvowsrk ), 
  absolutely !, 
  most famous carnival celebrations are organized in venice and in viareggio . 
  in the latter , they organize one of the biggest [ parades ] ( https://youtu.be/uccyto7rrqe ) in italy that was also broadcasted on national tv , not sure if they still do . 
  each region has also its tradional [ carnival mask/character ] ( http://www.solotablet.it/blog/school-3.0/percorso-di-carnevale-con-maschere-regionali-italiane-come-elementi-di-studio-su-tablet/image_large ) . 
  schools organize parties in the morning in which everybody dresses up and discos organize events . 
  personally , i know noone that does n't know the national anthem . 
  maybe some words are mispelled but it 's so catchy it literally enters inside your mind and never leaves you . 
   lukas graham ... lol . 
  i have read many people find him obnoxious but i personally do n't mind him , i mean , at least he personally writes his songs and put his heart into them . 
  talking about danish singers , i really like m\u00d8 . 
  i 'm sure a lot of people also know calvin harris . 
  i love this bot . 
  i do n't really know the perception of our diaspora but personally i just think it 's sad . 
  we actually had 2 diasporas : 1 started after the unification of italy in 1861 and that ended with the rise of fascism in 1920 , the second after the end of ww2 . 
  people left because they were poor especially , no surprise , in the south , and then all these people created communities basically in every part of the world , mostly in the americas . 
  when i watch the olympics sometimes it feels weird seeing the names of people of italian heritage from canada , australia , argentina , brazil or whatever country because it makes me think of the reasons why their parents/grandparents left the place they were born in to have a better life . 
  they were really harsh times . 
  talking about modern times , nowadays it 's mostly educated people that go work in other countries for having bigger salaries and more professional occasions , which is quite the opposite of what it used to be . 
  sweden . 
  for their music , for being open-minded , for their shitposts and their landscapes . 
  butter girls are i c o n i c. 
  we have : * [ lime and pink pepper flavored chips ] ( http://www.sancarlo.it/common/imgpub/564_592_it.jpg?0.028909434867261954 ) * [ coconut and turkemin ] ( http://www.sancarlo.it/common/imgpub/685_714_it.jpg?0.028909434867261954 ) the first are quite good , the others have a weird flavour but are eatable . 
  this . 
  they are really fascinating cities apart from their quality of life , i really want to visit them . 
  make her discover the good things in life !, 
  squid ink pasta is delicious unlike ketchup on spaghetti . 
  depending on the zone they even lace in between testicles and other parts of the animal . 
  the misjudged [ casu marzu ] ( http://it.geniuscook.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/marzu.jpg ) , aka * rotten cheese * , is very good . 
  then we have [ cordula ] ( http://www.sardegnaricette.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/img_2945.jpg ) that is made of entrails of lamb laced together to form a braid . 
  in some places it 's cooked with [ peas ] ( http://www.ricettesardegna.it/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/cordula-piselli.jpg ) , in others is [ roasted ] ( http://www.appartamentisantateresagallura.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/la-cordula-di-agnello-sardegna.jpg ) . 
  and last we have [ porcetto ] ( http://www.meteoweb.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cucina-2.jpg ) , that means piglet , completely roasted and flavored with spices , herbs and salt . 
  do people really think it looks bad ?
