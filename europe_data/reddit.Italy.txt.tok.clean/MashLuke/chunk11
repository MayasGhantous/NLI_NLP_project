  i mean , a norwegian has posted a picture of a sheep 's head on a plate , this looks good . 
  i do n't know from my perspective their english was pretty good . 
  oh you are right , i forgot it was swedish . 
  like this girl at [ 1:24 ] ( https://youtu.be/tlttzwxydle ) with the correct pronunciation . 
  otherwise , * acca emme * ( the way the letters `` h and m '' are said in italian ) . 
  some words have a different pronunciation depending on the country though , especially big brands and companies . 
  i would pronounce instagram in the same way they did with another italian , then its english pronunciation is obviously wrong . 
  italians . 
  most people talk like [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/3tlde2sacne ) , worst cases like [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/us9xi1boske ) . 
   porkamadona that 's a good one . 
  super popular , we usually end up in the top 10 too so . 
  it 's also a good way to give some space to lesser known sports that people would n't usually watch on their own . 
  talking about hot swimmers , danish swimmer [ pernille blume ] ( http://www.pernilleblume.com/media/1174/pernilleb-.jpg ) is one , and very talented too . 
  this is like the first time i have heard someone saying this . 
  dutch edm , best edm . 
  these songs are all good . 
  i had heard of yellow claw before but i had never realized they were dutch . 
  this is ... interesting . 
  a bit weird but in a good way . 
  sad . 
  going to the beach on summer with all the garbage around it 's devastating . 
  i always take my waste away but i wish the other people did that too . 
  it '' s mostly young people that leave bottles of vodka or bags of chips in the sand , not to talk about the cigarettes left . 
  tbh , i have always had the idea that people from central europe/northern europe are really in touch with nature or have the need to be free . 
  most of the times when you pass near to campsites you are more likely to find french or germans instead of italians , for example . 
  in scandinavia people usually walk naked in their houses which is by some , not me personally , seen as an indecorous and shameful act . 
  also by following some swedish/dutch singers i have seen several pictures of them walking and even staying on stage barefoot . 
  this might be casual but i have always had this impression . 
  reddit has helped me recognize the flags of the balkans that gave me some confusion at first but now i 'm sure i can identify them all . 
   climate change . 
  agree with this . 
  nope , it 's perfect as it is . 
  why do you do that ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  personally music and the internet have helped me a lot but tbh i have always liked english . 
  when i was a kid i studied vocables in primary school and grammar in middle school but i have started paying attention to pronunciation only recently . 
  in italian schools you study a lot of grammar but you never have the occasion to put in practise what you learn . 
  indeed , most people go to private schools to learn english . 
  anyway , when i hear a song i read lyrics while listening to it so at a certain point i remember them . 
  this has improved my listening a lot and when i hear something on the radio now i can easily identify some words , which makes me really happy . 
  along with this reddit is also really helping me , i always write down words that i have never seen before on my phone notes to memorize them and extend my vocabulary , and youtube videos with english subtitles are very useful too . 
  when i came back in italy from a trip in england this year , people asked me : `` how was london ? '', 
  although i did n't stay there . 
  some even asked me this considering london a country , instead of england . 
  i do n't know , maybe 16-17 ? 
  girls even 2 years before depending on the cases . 
  lol yeah . 
  i do n't see why the swiss should to accept it though , also independentists want the island to be a country per se . 
  how do you feel about it ? 
  i mean , in the end it 's only good for your economy but do n't you feel like many people miss a lot of things that your country has ? 
  most italians go to the netherlands only to get high . 
  sardinia to france ? 
  ehm , no . 
  i do n't see that working . 
  unless they improve our economy , then we can talk about it . 
  and then sell slovenia to italy ... , 
  `` better to like girls than being gay '' best quote . 
  in no particular order : * germany * sweden * the netherlands just curious about their respective cultures . 
  i have to say though that as long as i can remember some of their names i ca n't identify all of them on a map but i have heard each one of them at least once : alabama , arkansas , alaska , arizona , south carolina , north carolina , california , colorado , south dakota , north dakota , delaware , florida , georgia , haiwaii , idaho , illinois , indiana , kansas , kentucky , louisiana , maine , missouri , massachusetts , mississippi , montana , new york , new mexico , new jersey , nebraska , oregon , ohio , texas , washington , wisconsin . 
  i ca n't remember any other right now . 
  stereotypes : * california : hippy surfers , good rap scene , sunny , quite dry , where all the biggest developers go * washington : where all the men in suits live . 
  the great home of the president * new jersey : italians ( almost ) that have lost their italianess . 
  * florida : hispanic people , latinos , cubans . 
  very sunny and full of beaches * texas : cowboys , drunk rednecks , banjos , racist , big pick-ups * alaska : cold , oil extractors * haiwaii : tiki , tourists , fat polyneasian people , lilo & stitch . 
  normally yes , only 1 . 
  however , for special occasions the normality is 2 . 
  for example if you want to congratulate to a couple that just got married or even simply for christmas . 
  in italy it 's basically the same : m/f & f/f : everytime it 's a non-formal encounter m/m : family/friends ( only for festivities like christmas or new year 's eve . ), 
  between male friends it 's more common giving a handshake . 
  italian . 
  ah , this would be a nightmare for my shy being person . 
  sardinia . 
  each year they organise a parade of all traditional costumes of the island in sassari , it 's called `` cavalcata sarda '' . 
  edit : the event is in may so not in summer , but anyway you might find it interesting . 
  horses are common , at least in my zone . 
  although i would n't kill them for the simple reason their meat sucks . 
  yes he was famous as a businessman . 
  where do i start ? 
  : * [ `` il grande fratello '' ] ( https://youtu.be/nwejzjatrja ) ( the big brother ) and [ `` l'isola dei famosi '' ] ( https://youtu.be/oxgicqbuxzk ) ( the celebrity island ) . 
  the classic trashy reality shows that give space and attention to people that have been living under a carpet for a while and were forgotten by the world . 
  i do n't know why people watch them . 
  the formats are similar , in the first , that you probably know , live together in a flat . 
  in the other , people are live together in a desert island . 
  * [ uomini e donne ] ( https://youtu.be/lia62cu1nwi ) is a show that is supposed to generate new couples . 
  instead , it 's an entertaining program for single women and girls that like gossip . 
  it 's also a good source of memes , which is a good thing . 
  * [ ciao darwin ] ( http://www.ciaodarwin.mediaset.it/video/puntata/integratori_contro_bucatini/2 ) . 
  the title means `` goodbye darwin '' and i personally love this . 
  it 's tremendously stupid but it has been created with that purpose . 
  each episode there are two teams that have as members people that are the opposite of each other like : good-looking vs ugly , fat vs in shape ( like in the link i have posted ) , italians vs immigrants and etc. . . they have to fight each other in several battles like : singing competitions , obstacle courses and questions of general knowledge . 
  every day there 's also a different model that is named [ `` mother nature '' ] ( http://lookdavip.tgcom24.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ciao-darwin-7-prima-puntata-madre-natura-jenny-watwood.jpg ) ( `` madre natura '' in italian ) that has the very hard work to move a ball to randomly decide the competitors each time . 
  the program is also full of good-looking dancers ( both males and females ) that add sex-appeal to the program that includes many shots of asses and horny viewers [ like this ] ( http://www.telefilmaddicted.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/binocolo.gif ) . 
  after every round teams gather points and the one that in the end has the most wins . 
  buzzfeed even wrote [ an article ] ( https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/that-time-i-got-internet-famous-in-italy?utm_term=.ahez91dor#.muoeq3x56 ) about it . 
  the meme power in this program is too strong , wonderful . 
  i mean sending a puppet turkey was n't really a good idea . 
  better than the spaghetti grilled cheese sandwich that i have seen on instagram . 
  sweden for several reasons !, 
  second favourite , norway !,
