  it 's not uncommon putting sauces like ketchup or mayo on pizza , but ketchup on pasta ? 
  hell no . 
   kygo < 3, 
  i personally do n't follow football . 
  i think the general opinion is that they probably have the worst ultras in italy , some of the `` leaders '' are related with drug traffics and have contacts with camorra . 
  that i have seen , on reddit mostly , renzi was well received in europe . 
  not that much here . 
  in the past it happened they bought some matches and corrupted referees to win . 
  i do n't know if i would consider naming my children with a foreign name but martin , felix and astrid are cool names imo . 
  they ruined italy . 
  a lot of students go there to study english on summer , i have always heard nice things about it . 
  according to wikipedia the largest concert ever in italy is an [ event held the 1st of may in 2006 in rome ] ( https://youtu.be/ygik1ekwl1m ) to celebrate `` labor day '' that had an audience of 1,000,000 people . 
  the second largest is [ genesis , always in rome , in 2007 ] ( https://youtu.be/szepjetcffq ) that gathered 500,000 people, 
  oh well , writing `` la acqua '' or `` lo orso '' is incorrect in grammar . 
  two vowels ca n't stay next two each other if a word ends with it and the next starts with a vowel . 
  but we do n't have contractions like `` ca n't , do n't . . '', 
  no , they are n't . 
  in my mind that sound is similar to : * f - in `` think , thick . . '' * d - in `` these , those . . '' * v - in `` this , that . . '', 
  rather than strange i do n't know how to say `` th - '' , especially the adjectives `` this/these/that / those '' . 
  loreen - euphoria ( sweden ) [ 2012 ] she won that year , totally deserved . 
  english grammar is not difficult but right now that i 'm working on pronunciation i 'm doubting everything i say . 
  the `` th - '' sound is confusing me a lot , hearing native speakers talking it sometimes sounds like an `` f - '' , sometimes like a `` d - '' and sometimes like a `` v - '' . 
  also , being used to hear british people talking at school and mainly listening to american people and music now is making me wonder how to pronounce some words like the adjective `` our '' . 
  always talking about music the negative sentences are also confusing , stuff like : `` i trust nobody '' is sometimes `` i do n't trust nobody '' . 
  * italy will finally conquer mars * australia will be a eu member before turkey * canada and mexico will build a wall around the us * hillary clinton will still be winning the polls * the queen dies but her soul we 'll keep reigning forever * boris johnson will be discovered as donald trump lost twin brother . 
   jesus , king of poland gains traction as merkel 's successor to lead the eu . 
  he would probably be less conservative than a lot of politicians . 
  oh there are a lot : * cascada - everytime we touch * basshunter - now you 're gone * corona - rhythm of the night * snap !, 
  - rhythm is a dancer * snap !, 
  - the power * haddaway - what is love * dr. alban - it 's my life * ace of base - beautiful life * 2 unlimited - no limit * 2 unlimited - get ready for this * effeil 65 - blue ( da ba dee ) * gigi d'agostino - l'amour toujours, 
  good italodance !, 
  i prefer cargo pants to skinny jeans for example , anyway , they are certainly not stylish but i do n't care , they are comfy . 
  a lot of people wear them . 
  i remember this story , our journals talked about it . 
  truck , for rent , and about the second i use both . 
  no prob !, 
  i have added some titles . 
  italian hip-hop/rap scene is pretty good depeding on the artist , check out : * salmo ( blood shake/io sono qui/don medellin ) * fabri fibra ( in italia/vip in trip ) * caparezza ( vieni a ballare in puglia/legalize the premier ) * articolo 31/j-ax ( gente che spera/maria ) * marracash ( salvador dali/a volte esagero ) * clud dogo/gu \u00e8 pequeno ( ca n't figure it out right now ) * ghali ( ninna nanna/dende ) * sfera ebbasta ( figli di pap\u00e0 / brnbq ) * dark polo gang ( mafia ), 
  yes , exactly . 
  there were some `` scandals '' last year about the celebration of christmas in public schools . 
  a group of mothers went to school to teach kids christmas songs but only to christian ones , excluding the others , in another school there was a debate about the presence of the nativity scene and in another people went nuts because the principal refused to accept the benediction of the local archbishop to the building . 
  these news were reported by national journals and there was a sort of debate between the right-wing that thought this was an inglorious act against our traditions and the left-wing that wanted not to `` offend '' muslims . 
  these would have been local issues but they became excessively important . 
  no , we do n't have them . 
  pandas are not in danger anymore !, 
  you joke about it but kanye west has publicly said he is going to run for president in 2020 so she might become the first lady . 
  italian and phylosophy , i know it 's considered one of the best subjects at school but i just do n't like it . 
  imo the `` divine comedy '' should be taught in 1 year like the other books , i absolutely do n't get why they keep teaching it during all the last years of high school while it does n't even coincide with the history and philosophy 's programs . 
  anyway , for me the worst is alessandro manzoni , he spent 8 fucking excessively big chapters describing an action that lasts 3 days about 2 miserable idiots that escape from their village . 
  yeah , r/crappydesign would have materials for an entire year . 
  english . 
  just for the language i assume . 
  i really like ours , also the french ones are cool . 
  i would love to learn swedish to understand what you write on your subreddit , it 's awesome . 
  for me personally it 's christmas eve , in fact i just ca n't wait to eat tomorrow , yeaaaaahhhhh . 
  also the technical heir to the throne is an idiot . 
  who cares , trains were always pvnctval and swamps were drained , that 's what really matters . 
  do n't worry , i 'm full of [ this stuff ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3rq74ms.jpg ) just in case . 
  how dare yov mocking gloriovs fascist italy . 
  i like this [ one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9qmlh8s.jpg ) too . 
  totally approved . 
  that 's so hilarious . 
  i would say basketball . 
  apple and samsung . 
  well , if one of their parents is italian and they have always lived in italy they are italian . 
  otherwise , they are the first to consider themselves brazilian or whatever . 
  honestly i think some people actually think southern europeans are sort of black . 
  lol , what the heck . 
  i know someone that was asked : `` what ocean surrounds italy ? '', 
  in the us . 
   italy would become bellezza . 
  romanian is a romance language , you ca n't argue with that . 
  yes and yes . 
  the problem is we do n't even have toilet paper containers . 
  yes we have , mainly inside parks . 
  never understood that , i know there are priorities but paying a big quantity of toilet paper ca n't put the school in debt . 
  the funny thing is that the teacher bathroom always had it ... 
  north/south pandoro/panettone, 
  the funniest thing about english speakers reading italian words is the way they pronounce words that end in '' - e '' . 
  same , honestly who really finds talking to a stranger in the lift an appropriate behaviour ? 
  why should i fake i want to know how your day was ? 
  i sometimes even ignore my neighbours by pretending i 'm reading my phone . 
  the only time i had small talks was with some elders on the bus . 
  fuck them . 
  ^ nah ^ just ^ kidding , ^ they ^ are ^ funny ^ people ^ sometimes, 
  operatic pop ( we basically invented the genre ) : - andrea bocelli , luciano pavarotti , il volo pop : - laura pausini , eros ramazzotti , tiziano ferro , elisa , nek , alexia electro : - giorgio moroder , effeil 65 , benny benassi , alex gaudino , gigi d'agostino , planet funk . 
  for some reasons inna and alexandra stan were and still kinda are very popular in italy . 
  although i have to admit `` mr. saxobeat '' was catchy af . 
   daft punk , m83 , madeon < 3  rap  maitre gims choose one . 
   indila < 3, 
  i love edm so i know many dutch producers . 
  within temptation and caro emerald are really good !, 
  +10 cooking skills +20 creativity +30 general knowledge -15 corruption -15 political instability -30 solving problems, 
  elders there speak german but say blasphemies in italian . 
  [ pretty cool . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/y91fkfcbz3s ) - video contains * bestemmie *,
