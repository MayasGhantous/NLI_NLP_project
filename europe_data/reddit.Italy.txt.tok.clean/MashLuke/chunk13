  s w e d e n w e d e n, 
  if they yell , they are italian . 
  this is hilarious and depressimg at the same time . 
  trust us , we will stay on your side forever !, 
  ^ maybe, 
  no , although i would n't mind colder winters . 
  i agree about the tourists but the decorations and the way it was built are really fascinating . 
  snow is normal in italy but based on the zone is not that frequent . 
  in the last 10 years it has snowed like 4 times in my city , i 'm in the south , and because they are n't prepared to control it so schools are closed . 
  anyway it lasts like 1/2 days so not that much . 
  in the north is so common i 'm not sure they close schools because of it . 
  never seen a jar of it in any shop . 
  i `` kinda '' tasted it though because in an ice cream shop that i know they have a flavour with peanut butter . 
  it 's not my cup of tea , too salty . 
  in some italian cities there 's a tradition called `` liberatio scholarum '' ( students ' liberation ) . 
  do n't know about the others but in my city it works in this way . 
  the goliardic students ' groups of the city 's universities go to high schools and `` free '' the students for 3 consecutive days in december to make christmas holidays longer . 
  to thank them for their action students usually give them cigarettes and money that they use to buy alcohol and celebrate . 
  the goliards are easily identifiable by their [ hat ] ( http://www.cappelleriamelegari.com/images/large/h3/hpim5332_lrg.jpg ) , called * felluca * , and by the noise they make with their cars while going around the city playing horns . 
  there are also initiation rites , the new members have to stay down on their knees with their pants down and the masters make them drink beer from a hole on one side of a can in front of school entrance . 
  here 's a [ video ] ( https://youtu.be/ti6d7fsqny0 ) of the liberatio, 
  i 'm curious , how did you manage to visit so many countries ? 
  what do you mean with `` italian kebab '' ? 
  the places that make kebab in my city are owned by turks and moroccans . 
  i ca n't argue with the taste though , kebab is good . 
  yep, 
  everytime i remember there 's an actual piece of russia between poland and lithuania it 's so weird . 
  sorry , i was in my proud-of-my-region moment . 
  definitely beautiful . 
  [ mamuthones ] ( https://sonosdesardigna.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/026-mamut.jpg ) [ issohadores ] ( http://www.sardahousing.com/public/ideevacanza/issohadore_best.jpg ) [ boes and merdules ] ( http://www.merdules.com/images/boes_merdules_posa.jpg ), 
  warm/hot autumns not that cold winters ( it snows very very rarely where i live ) warm springs hot summers, 
  for some reasons some people think chips on pizza are excessive/unusual while kebab is a normal topping . 
  tbh chips are one of the most common toppings here . 
  same . 
  also sushi, 
  although i have n't seen that much , nantes was such a beautiful city !, 
  i also had a very nice stay in saint-malo . 
  agreed , annecy is beautiful !, 
  yeah ... 
  i like the german one more . 
  the new the weeknd 's album !, 
  this song is so cool . 
  well i 'm in the south so that might be true . 
  mine has dinner on dec. 24th , lunch on christmas , dinner on christmas when you basically eat the leftovers , lunch on dec. 26th and dinner again the same day . 
  where do you live ? 
  on december 8th people decorate the christmas tree and some also recreate the [ nativity scene ] ( http://www.lostivalepensante.it/wp-content/uploads/presepe.jpg ) ( called presepe ) , it 's a huge tradition here . 
  the scene does n't contain jesus at first that is put on christmas ' day , when he was born ( of course ) . 
  on december 24th families get reunited at somebody 's house . 
  at dinner time , we eat a lot of food like lasagne and eggplant parmesan and at the end of the meal we eat one of the two traditional italian christmas desserts : [ panettone ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/panettone ) and [ pandoro ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/pandoro ) . 
  each year there 's a feud about which one of them is the best , it 's part of our circlejerk . 
  personally pandoro is the best . 
  eating it with nutella and ice cream on the top makes you reach heaven , and tiramis\u00f9 made with it it 's a blessing . 
  people who like panettone are just elders who ca n't enjoy life . 
  at midnight people open their presents and we ultimately celebrate by opening a bottle of [ spumante ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sparkling_wine#italian_sparkling_wine ) . 
  the first the one i can think of is [ alessandria ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/alessandria ) that in italian has the same name of the respective egyptian city [ alexandria ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexandria ) . 
  the two names are not related though . 
  i mean it depends on the person but i confess i do that gesture and i have seen other people doing it . 
  personally i think genoa is ugly , it has some nice things but the city as a whole is horrible . 
   nique bien ta putain de m\u00e8re , fils de pute my french is poor but i can easily understand what you said lol, 
   `` oh you 're from denmark !, 
  i love denmark ! '', 
  it could have been worse , she could have said belgium . 
  you are doing good !, 
  after visiting reddit regularly i started realizing i do that thing quite a lot . 
  i do n't even know when i have learnt it , i just do . 
  nah i was kidding , on a more serious note i do n't think there 's really an ugly country in europe . 
  every country has its beauty , although some more than others ( this is a undeniable ) , but i think it 's all subjective . 
  italy itself could be considered ugly for some aspects . 
  i do n't know how i could even forget that . 
  yes , of course they are . 
  anyway i think this is due to the stereotype `` southern italians are n't white '' that was common in america when a lot of southern italians emigrated to the us . 
  i love the way english sounds but i think french is very soft and good to listen to . 
  dov ' \u00e8 la macedonia ? 
  where is macedonia ? 
  in the fridge !, 
  - macedonia in italian means `` fruit salad '' but also macedonia the country . 
  cottages ? 
  that i know nobody has one , it 's very common to have an house near to the seaside though . 
  in italy we have a kids song competition called `` zecchino d'oro '' that has been broadcasted since 1963 and some songs that won it became very famous , here 's a [ playlist ] ( http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plzd9nh2pnt6smeepm7p-wgp144qpefjm3 ) other suggestions are : * [ pulcino pio ] ( https://youtu.be/juqyzgnbspy ) - * cheep chick * ( this song even reached the top of the italian chart in 2012 , what a horrible year ) * [ i leocorni ] ( https://youtu.be/8m6jrmiqitc ) - * i do n't know how to translate this , they are basically 2 unicorns * * [ alla fiera dell ` est ] ( https://youtu.be/qkorhklr22a ) - * in the eastern fair * * [ ma che bel castello ] ( https://youtu.be/bre4mfckwri ) - * what a beautiful castle * * [ la bella lavanderina ] ( https://youtu.be/du3b2p6pc2u ) - * the beautiful little laundress * * [ fr\u00e0 martino ] ( https://youtu.be/qdo8kpjyhsg ) - * friar martin * * [ la pecora nel bosco ] ( https://youtu.be/iejtfkkmbhk ) - * the sheep in the wood *, 
  i know that but some people are mainly focused on what it could cause . 
  the people who say this are the same who say meat causes cancer , think vaccines cause autism and etc. . 
  anyway a reduction of its use would probably be great for the environment but i think companies mainly write it for a commercial use rather than really thinking about it . 
  if i 'm right it all started when they said it could cause cancer so then many people started complaining about it . 
  if i type `` olio di palma '' ( palm oil in italian ) the first results on google are : * pros and cons * is bad * is bad for health * is not bad * sustainable, 
  palm oil . 
  basically they started telling it 's bad for health and companies like nutella got accused for its use so right now brands write `` without palm oil '' on the boxes of their products , like everywhere . 
  so now we have stuff like [ this ] ( http://i.cdn-lk.it/blobs/full/c/1/2/4/c1248f83-b36d-4376-b23d-299d17fb71e2.jpg?_636113404602470018 ) * hey , do you want a cigarette ? 
  * no , thanks !, 
  * but it 's without palm oil, 
  nowadays only adults and elders are very religious ( elders way more than adults of course ) but some people , even young people , tend to be bigots . 
  if we have articles in our national newspapers about people who complain they do n't make the nativity scene at school there must be a reason . 
  the majority of the youth does n't care that much but christianity is so deep-rooted in our society that almost everybody has received all the sacraments . 
  personally i 'm only baptized , never received the others , but i say less blasphemies than people who have , so ... 
  let me try : italy : sergio mattarella ( easy one ) ... that 's all i know . 
  but i love our anthem !, 
  it cheers you up and makes you actually feel proud of being italian !, 
  i think swedish stands for its musicability and that 's probably one of the reasons why sweden is so good at making music . 
  i think it sounds great and it has a beautiful flow . 
  this is probably going to sound offensive but it 's a huge stereotype . 
  brits , how many times do you really take a shower ?
