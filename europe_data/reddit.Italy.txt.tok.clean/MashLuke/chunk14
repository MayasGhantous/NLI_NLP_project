  i do n't know , the list would be pretty big because we tend to constantly compare ourselves to the other countries and many people would have different opinions about this topic . 
  anyway , the educational system , for sure . 
  maybe [ this ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=molise ) is going to make everything clearer . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/nonciclopedia/images/b/b2/italia-senza-molise.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140720230027 ), 
  we elected a [ hungarian pornstar ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ilona_staller ) to our parliament . 
  dutch to me sounds like someone is trying to communicate by only clearing one 's throat . 
  or like a german that is suffocating . 
  of course you should !, 
  1 year is a lot of time to learn grammar , the main problem might be pronunciation but you will learn more there . 
  also , because of the fact people around the streets usually barely speak english , they will speak to you in italian so you are going to have a lot of occasions to pratice . 
  this sounds good , very good . 
  many teens are still uncertain about their ideal profession and it 's not that unusual that when someone decides to study a certain subject at university after a while understands that is not made for that kind of job . 
  they made it to `` introduce '' students in the world of work but at the moment it 's not helping at all . 
  they are constantly changing the school system but without any improvement ...  is italy trying to appease businesses or something by offering them free labor ? 
  you joke about it but that was my first thought , i do n't know if others agree with me but basically they want to improve the students chances of getting a job by making them work without an actual job . 
  this act already existed for vocational schools but they extended it to gymnasiums . 
  in fact the main protests are from students of these schools . 
  no , although some disagree they basically get used by companies and shops . 
  i do n't know but on this [ pic ] ( http://rs950.pbsrc.com/albums/ad343/brightpyre/fairly%20odd%20parents%20gals/oldervicky5.jpg?w=480&amp;h=480&amp;fit=clip ) the guy on the left is a stereotypical brit from a popular american cartoon, 
  i think several people would say weed , there is a pretty high consume and many would want it to be legalized . 
  when you are 16 can you legally drink only beer or even hard liquors ? 
  also , apart from voting and driving does everybody support the choice of buying cigarettes at such a young age ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  oh yeah , i made an employee at starbucks write a * bestemmia * on my cup instead of my regular name . 
  usually , also according to the advent calendar , from december 1 and then throughout december till january 6 . 
  mm i ca n't think of any words . 
  the only one that comes in mind is ** cagacazzo ** that is a curse word that literally means * dickshitter * and it 's used to refer to someone who is very annoying . 
  people are called * italians * 2 . 
  the adjective is * italian * 3 . 
  the language is * italian * very hard to remember , we confuse these all the time / s, 
  any girl from scandinavia is acceptable . 
  i live in a small center and some stuff happened a couple times but tbh the majority of them do n't do anything the whole day . 
  they just walk around the city , use pubblic transportations and sometimes play football . 
  that 's it . 
  also i have never seen a syrian refugee , only economical ones from africa . 
  i would not call these `` stupid '' , more like `` silly '' but anyway your `` school spirit days '' . 
  when i read you have stuff like `` pajama day '' or the `` twin day '' i thought it was funny , in the end it 's not a big deal , it 's a way to make school less boring but stuff like this is n't normally done in schools . 
  ** french ** indila ( pop ) yelle ( electronic/pop ) stromae ( electronic/pop ) indochine ( rock ) ** italian ** willie peyote ( rap ) elisa ( pop ) jovanotti ( pop/rap ) cesare cremonini ( pop ) salmo ( rap/hip-hop ) sfera ebbasta ( rap/hip-hop ) tbh i do n't listen that much to italian music but some of these artists are extremely popular and are the few ones i do n't mind listening to that much . 
   san marino basically a small town who considers itself some kind of glorious country , anyway i do n't think there are people that really care about micro-states . 
  bud spencer !, 
  that 's very interesting !, 
  we do n't study that much about the dutch history , we mainly focus on the british/french/german / spanish history , and italian of course , but the netherlands have a very interesting past . 
   but the italians were only stealing food and no one was afraid of them . 
  absolutely yes . 
  if i had to do it for my glorious nation i would probably say fuck croatia , fuck slovenia , julian march belongs to italy !, 
  if not , i think the people there are fine with their respective nations , unless they want to leave , then we could talk about it ... 
  oh you do n't have to , all men know her . 
  valentina nappi ( eheh ) on a more serious note , i have no clue , maybe [ elisabetta canalis ] ( https://alessandrogirola.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/elisabetta-canalis-2016-8.jpg ), 
  it 's becoming a thing . 
  it 's just another occasion to have fun and get drunk without an apparent reason , they organise themed parties and some kids even try to knock at strangers ' doors to get some candies , without success tbh . 
  it has nothing to do with the italian culture so it 's like an autumn carnival , but you have to look spooky . 
  all saints ' day is workfree in the whole country and it has always been so . 
  edit : actually in some parts of italy there are traditions similar to halloween where kids go around the cities to ask forgiveness for the dead souls but it 's more a regional thing . 
  definitely . 
  i would say yes and no ... if someone gets the citizenship i do n't see why it should matter but in social relationships it might be considered important . 
  i guess it depends on how much that person feels italian , being a legal citizen and feeling part of the country are 2 different things . 
  oh they are still popular between young generations , newcomers are `` rare '' in the italian music industry so the most popular artists are the ones who became popular back then . 
  there is n't a generational change like in the other countries . 
  about the vowels i agree with you . 
  i think italian could have the same popularity as english , spanish and even french music but it 's hard because i think our lyrics are somehow more `` complicated '' . 
  english per se has a very simple grammar , a lot of words only have one syllable and this makes it perfect to make sentences by only using a few words , an example : english : you / should / go / and / love / your/self ( 7 syllables ) italian : do/vre/sti / an/da/re / ed / a/ma/re / te/stes/so ( 13 syllables ) this makes italian songs sound more like poetries , which it is not a bad thing , but it affects the lyrics so much that the majority of the songs tend to use very long terms . 
  everybody wants to be considered the next poet but only a few are really talented artists . 
  anyway if you want more italian music i suggest you to search laura pausini , eros ramazzotti , elisa , giorga , marco mengoni , jovanotti and cesare cremonini . 
  sardinia . 
  i live in one of the italian islands but apart from it i have never visited the others . 
  english songs dominate , anyway , italians absolutely love spanish songs . 
  in every disco you will hear a spanish song at least once , the genre is even overtaking edm , and hate it . 
  they all sound the same and after hearing `` movi la colita '' or `` bailamos fino a los cinqos de la magnana '' during the all night it only makes me want to quit and go home at 2 am . 
  italian music has its listeners anyway , it 's as loved as english music and spanish music but its quality it 's meh imo . 
  they are mainly clich\u00e9 love songs , i 've always loved english music and mainly hated the italian one , or at least , it 's hard to find something that is actually good . 
  spanish songs dominate here too . 
  hearing every summer a new earworm is so annoying . 
  every fucking year there 's always that stupid song that gets overplayed by radios , that instantly hits the n. 1 spot of the chart and then as september starts you do n't hear it anymore . 
  fuck you enrique iglesias . 
  sure , i can . 
  i 'll talk about the main points . 
  the new changes modify the mandatory final exam of secondary school and the assignment of grades in primary and middle school . 
  since last year all the students from the third year of secondary school have to complete 200/400 hours of work , based on the school , in shops/public institutes or whatever , during the last three years of it . 
  this thing has always existed in technical institutes but not in high schools . 
  this new law was created because italian school poorly prepares the students to the world of work so they thought it was a good idea . 
  with this new law this act , called `` alternanza scuola-lavoro '' , that literally means `` alternation school-work '' , will become more important and students will have to show what they have done in these years during the final exam . 
  this exam nowadays consists of 3 tests : the first is based on the school choice ( math/physics for scientific high school , greek/latin for grammar schools ) , the second is an italian test , and the third consists of a big quiz that includes all the other subjects . 
  if this new law passes this last test is going to no exist anymore . 
  another change is going to happen to the exam commission that now consists of group of teachers from several schools , thing decided to guarantee impartiality , that it 's going to be composed of the teachers that work in that same school . 
  talking about primary and middle school they are going to be completely changed . 
  the grade system in italy consists of a scale of numbers from 0 to 10 . 
  the grades in primary and middle school are going to be letters instead , from a to e , and the students wo n't be rejected . 
  so even if someone has bad grades they wo n't skip any class but will keep going on . 
  they do n't know how to make a reasonable reform , since 2010 there is no exit from this hell , every new law is constantly making school worse . 
  i feel you . 
  yes and no . 
  october is going to end and it was 25 \u00b0 until last day . 
  i want the cold now . 
  i had to learn `` my mistress ' eyes are nothing like the sun '' by william shakespeare in high school . 
  in italian , several nursery rhymes in primary school and a poetry by dante alighieri in middle school . 
  i think it 's pretty common in italy . 
  these are the first ones that come in my mind : * alex zanardi - paracyclist * pietro mennea - runner * valentino rossi - motorcyclist * alberto tomba - skier * andrea lucchetta - volleyball player * juri chechi - gymnast * valentina vezzali - fencer * federica pellegrini - swimmer * tania cagnotto - diver * carolina kostner - ice skater plus that are several cyclists and fencers but i do n't know their names . 
  also our volleyball and waterpolo teams are very succesful .
