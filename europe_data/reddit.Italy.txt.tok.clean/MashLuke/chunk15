  it looks pretty normal to me . 
  that 's funny ahah , some italians think the same but if i have to go over my patriotic spirit , pizza is so mainstream that you can find a good one almost everywhere . 
  anyway a thing that i do n't get is the `` deep dish '' pizza , everytime i see it i find it kinda gross , in the sense that it does n't look appealing at all to me . 
  it looks so excessive . 
  a lot of italian dishes became traditional in the us due to the flow of italian immigrants that went there so i do n't find it that weird . 
  we could say that italians `` italianised '' the us . 
  this is n't exactly a good representation but this zone is one of the most dangerous in italy : http://maps.google.com/maps?layer=c&amp;panoid=-ekfhu__h8dgqgyersbu_q&amp;cbp=1%2c70.939026%2c%2c3.0%2c-11.162704, 
  i think britain has always considered britain less european . 
  i laughed . 
   here is extremely normal to use olive oil ( we do n't use anything else ) . 
  for us , butter or sunflower oil is like destroying the food . 
  it 's the same here , i guess this is the effect of being surrounded by the mediterranean sea . 
  few people can speak it properly . 
  adults are rarely able to do it and while more teens know at least the basics just a few can hold a conversation . 
  in my opinion english is taught very badly in public school , the majority of teens go to private schools to learn it , and some ca n't speak it even by doing so . 
  it is . 
  just saw [ this ] ( https://scontent-mxp1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14729305_1593109044329775_1445732174912971995_n.jpg?oh=813e114450d2b2c9cb71b9b12f11057a&amp;oe=585f7a3b ) on my facebook wall also [ this ] ( https://scontent-mxp1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/13497831_901092693353657_2962710248366917775_o.jpg ), 
  things like masterchef and x factor are insanely popular . 
  i think that gomorra might the most popular show althought i have never seen it . 
  these are the most popular names in 2014 : ** boys : ** francesco , alessandro , lorenzo , andrea , leonardo , mattia , matteo , gabriele , riccardo , tommaso . 
  ** girls : ** sofia , giulia , aurora , giorgia , martina , emma , greta , chiara , sara , alice i think `` francesco '' became the most popular name due to pope francis , that is called `` francesco '' in italian . 
  anyway you can get my real name by reading my username . 
  pineapple is love , pineapple is life . 
  just booked a ticket for mexico , i have a crowd following me right now . 
  homosexuality is still seen as a bad or a disgusting thing , because of religion but also because of other social issues . 
  it depends on the people but there is a huge amount of christians , especially , against it , also talking about sexual life in general it 's not considered an appropriate thing . 
  this might sound stupid but for example if every singer did a song about sex like they do in the us it would cause a scandal every single time . 
  i do n't find football so entertaining and pineapple pizza is good . 
  this is interesting , here if you want to learn to swim you have to go to the local swimming pool and have lessons by paying . 
  i think it 's becoming way more popular than before , which is good thing imo , but non-swimmers do exist , especially adults . 
  between kids it 's becoming very uncommon , fortunately . 
  it 's hard because we have different mentalities , school is a public institution so it should be taken seriously , you are there only for studying , not for having fun . 
  if you want to party you do it outside of school . 
  i honestly would n't mind having more breaks throughout the year but i think the real problem is the amount of homeworks we get . 
  our system is based on hard work at both school and home so doing stuff like this would mean wasting time with the program we have to do and it would mean more work later in the end of the year . 
  i 'm still in high school so i can answer you directly . 
  no , we do n't . 
  few schools have their own symbols or colours . 
  we do n't even throw parties like you do in the us , the only time we do it it 's for carnival , and i have celebrated it at schools only 4 times in all my school career . . and just last year for the 1st time in high school . . and they did n't even want to let us do it . 
  everybody lives with this american high school `` dream '' , because of american teen films or sitcoms like `` high school musical '' that had a huge impact here . 
  some of my classmates are now studying in the us for a year and trust me when i say i was shocked when i saw their videos of basketball and football matches , the hype , the atmosphere , everything was unreal . 
  we also care about sports but if you want to do it competitively you must join a private sport association that runs a field or a swimming pool , for example . 
  school teams do exist but they are not taken that seriously like you do , they are only for regional ( and maybe national ) competitions but it 's not like the entire school goes watching it . 
  do n't get me wrong but americans in general tend to be very `` patriotic '' in every sense , we have n't such a strong feeling of membership and union . 
  the truth is italian schools are just boring , you just study a lot , you reach levels of stress out of this world but there are few moments of fun while you have stuff like `` pajama day '' which it 's crazy !, 
  i 'm saying this in a good way , we should do have more moments like the ones you talked about because apart from being stressed and tired , i 'm not feeling anything else . 
  the soldier next to her is like : `` so proud of my queen '' * cries for deep emotions *, 
  they obviously help the economy . 
  i do n't know how they are like in the biggest cities so i 'll talk about my little dimension . 
  they are fine , i have never seen someone being rude or unpolite . 
  tbh we sometimes annoy them . 
  my friends have several times asked many girls to take a picture with us and we have sometimes yelled at boys things like `` hey , she is a single girl ! '', 
  while pointing our female friends . 
  i think in general we are the most inaproppriate tourists , when i went to england i went for the first time to a starbucks and instead of saying my name i told them an italian blasphemy . 
  also playing italian songs around the city and singing the national anthem out loud was a fun time . 
  there 's this unknown food that is called `` pizza '' . 
  it 's one of the most delicious things we have , it 's like a focaccia with tomato sauce and mozzarella and you can put everything you want on it : mushrooms , sausages , other cheese , nutella , pineapple , bananas ... everything . 
  i think it is the perfect representation of italy , you should try it one day . 
  it 's not like a `` wtf ( put country 's name ) '' moment but i do n't understand why some people from central/northern europe do n't put sun cream while they are at the beach . 
  seeing people that look like huge tomatoes it 's painful . 
  it 's not something to not care about . 
  none . 
  it 's not like this stuff happens all the time , as in every big city bad episodes happen ( unfortunately ) and there are certain zones that everybody should avoid . 
  europe is generally a safe place , just stay away from train stations and low-income suburbs as u/idkfa _ cz said , especially at late night . 
  italians are so easy to recognize when they speak english , my accent it 's something i always try to mask because when i hear an italian speaking in that way i find it very cringey . 
  i think this is due to our bad pronunciation , we always italianaze everything . 
  the hairy women is a stereotype even here , especially between italian girls . 
  i would say bread , milk , cheese , vegetables , fruits and sheep/pork meat . 
  the first thing that comes in mind is this : [ tot\u00f2 sapore e la magica storia della pizza ] ( https://youtu.be/lnqvdlh03ew ) an animated film that takes place in naples and talks about the history of pizza . 
  pretty much the most italian cartoon ever made , very well done imo . 
  edit : by searching i remembered other films : * [ la freccia azzura ] ( https://youtu.be/lx9g9aksz6w ) : a story about a tradition that takes place in italy during epiphany where a old lady , called [ befana ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/befana ) , gives gifts to kids the 6th of january . 
  * [ la gabbianella e il gatto ] ( https://youtu.be/iz6qgtbmzc0 ) it talks about a cat that finds a little seagull , the 2 become friends and the cat will teach her how to fly , it 's a kid film so the plot is pretty basic but it had a good response , i remember watching it and it was good one . 
  italy makes a lot of cartoons but very few animated films . 
  anyway kinder , yeah the chocolate brand , used to make several animated films that were insanely popular , here some examples : * [ i lunes e la sfera di lasifer ] ( https://youtu.be/ekxjzfsxku8 ) * [ i rote\u00f2 e la magia dello specchio ] ( https://youtu.be/s00vc5hr8ng ) * [ i lampaclima e l'isola misteriosa ] ( https://youtu.be/b276i3vf1ui ), 
  italian . 
  my parents rarely speak in dialect , it 's more used by elders , in rural areas and in small towns . 
  adults speak it but not like them , it 's not considered a polite way to talk , we avoid it in certain situations like at school , i would never talk to my teachers in that way . 
  maybe french because we use some expressions in it but in your daily life , unless you live in a big city or have to deal with tourists , english is enough . 
  yeah , same here . 
  i think every generation is different , people who lived in the 80s are different from the people born in the 90s and in the 00s . 
  i 'm very young so i would say the approach with tecnology , the possibility of finding all the types of informations in a few minutes and the ability of connecting with people from other countries like we are doing right now . 
  it could be worse but could also be better . 
  basically i spend the most of the time ignoring everything that 's happening around me because it 's easier than actually doing what i have to do . 
  i speak in italian but just not only in italian , example : * a : `` che fai questo pomeriggio ? 
  oh , non aggiu gana '' * a : `` pocu sei mandrone '' translated : * a : `` have you something to do this afternoon ? 
  let 's go playing football '' * b : `` football again ? 
  sorry but i i 'm not in the mood '' * a : `` you are so lazy '' pretty much that 's what happens . 
  i live in northern sardinia and i speak sassarese and sardinian that are actually considered real languages by the italian government . 
  i think in general it 's pretty common in the whole country , it 's not like i speak it fluenty like i do with italian but i do say some words in it . 
  some examples are `` eja '' that means `` yes '' and `` aj\u00f2 '' that means `` let 's go '' that are constantly used in the whole island . 
  i have learned this by listening to the people around me , especially my grandparents that always do a mix of dialect and italian . 
  obviously english , and my dialect with family and friends if we consider it as another language . 
  yeah , each language is interesting . 
  personally i find dutch very funny , for me when i hear it it 's all just guttural sounds . 
  / r/itaglia anyway , we talk shit even in the official one, 
  never been there but it looks too chaotic for me . 
  i know several people who are completely obsessed with it , i think it 's a good city to see but not exactly to live in if you have n't a good retribution . 
  anyway i 'm totally ignorant about its lifestyle but i live in a small city of 100.000 people so that would be a huge change . 
  yes and no , only the part really close to china or japan . 
  technically even australia is in the eastern part of the world but as you said you consider it to be part of the western world .
