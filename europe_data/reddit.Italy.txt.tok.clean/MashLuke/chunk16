  it 's not only the postion but also the culture . 
  we consider east all the arab and asian countries ( and i mean populated by asians ) , west all europe and countries that have a similar culture like the us , canada , australia and new zealand . 
  then it comes africa and latin america that i think can be put apart from these categories for various cultural reasons . 
  anyway , everybody can have their own perspective of the world . 
  i mean , can we consider russia asian ... ? 
  we have a town that is called `` paese '' that means town in italian . 
  so a town named town . 
  `` hey mom look , i 'm on tv !, 
  and so it 's dad , and grandma , and my teacher , and my schoolmates , and the postman and ... '', 
  i mean , i think people in san marino watch italian shows and read italian newspapers . 
  yeah that 's true , he is one of the few exceptions !, 
  even a lot of young people listen to him , he is such a great composer . 
  anyway talking about music in general i personally think italian labels always put into the market the same type of artists because they know they are going to sell . 
  the majority of acts or have been in the industry for a lot of time ( like eros ramazzotti or laura pausini ) or have won a talent show like x factor ( marco mengoni or francesca michielin ) . 
  nobody has a real personality except few people , we lack of creativity , or at least , nobody spends money to support creative people . 
  indila is so great, 
  norway : [ lido - everything ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl3lii-frdz_fjmyv2khgghazzqbqpdgfb ) ( electronic ) so great , if you like electronic music you must listen to him , he 's not like the other mainstream artists, 
  music : it sucks compared to the other countries , i have listened even to german pop music and i think it 's way better than ours . 
  to not talk about sweden , norway , the netherlands and france that constantly put out successful international artists . 
  the majority of singers are boring love singers that ca n't get over their break-ups although they have released all their albums about it . 
  it needs variety , there are a couple of producers that almost write every song and it gets boring . 
  movies : i do n't see that many films but i think we are good at it , we had and have talented people . 
  shows : it 's mainly made for elders . 
  there are very few things for young people and i find national tv very cringey when they put something young in an adult show . 
  totally cringey . 
  well , not that surprising, 
  yeah , same here . 
  right now there is this meme about `` palm oil '' , it started after they spent months talking about its use and some brands starting having the text `` without palm oil '' so now we have stuff like [ this ] ( http://i.cdn-lk.it/blobs/full/c/1/2/4/c1248f83-b36d-4376-b23d-299d17fb71e2.jpg?_636113404602470018 ) . 
  or there 's this current meme about coldplay because the italian website that sold the tickets has probably connection with illegal resellers and just a few people has bought the tickets so you get stuff like : * picture of the film charlie and the chocolate factory '' `` rare picture of a kid holding an unfindable coldplay ticket '' there 's also this idea of picking up random pictures with a text under it that does n't match the photo , like [ this ] ( https://scontent-ams3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14702329_979044592225133_510059538739526463_n.jpg?oh=a2dc562480f4f8bb3d88602814aa7a93&amp;oe=589da45e ) if you want more italian memes this facebook page is awesome : https://www.facebook.com/irreverentitalianmemes/, 
  my bad . 
  in general i would say mussolini because , you know . 
  talking about people still alive there are a lot of politicians that are absolutely assholes , i hate every politician that use social networks to shake masses of people with easy scandals like matteo salvini or alessandro di battista , i do n't think it 's a good way to promote yourself and after reading several posts about the same topics it gets annoying . 
  renzi is an idiot too , he still has to realize is running a country and not doing much to actually improve it , berlusconi is an idiot , i do n't have too add anything . 
  let 's say this , the worst person is the political class but if you want an actual person i still think mussolini is the worst . 
  or brutus because he killed julius caesar , fuck him . 
  he told in an interview that he thought they wanted the other girl to win and that they were on purpose asking more difficult questions to him than her . 
  that program is really popular here and after watching it several times it might be true , they sometimes ask dumb questions to the most eccletic and funniest people and only hard ones to the others . 
  i honestly would n't mind it , it all depends if you can understand the answers or not . 
  nestle and kellogs are popular but i would not say they are that popular . 
  adults usually just drink coffee and eat pastries . 
  these cereals are the most popular i think : https://www.buonalavita.it/sites/default/files/nesquik-330g_780x530.jpg, 
  ask in / r/italy, 
  * https://youtu.be/wtex_droktw ( guy says wrecking things to protest it 's right ) * https://youtu.be/qi77sh9vid0 ( man during a quiz show instead of answering seriously says `` for me it 's the onion '' ) * https://youtu.be/7wmadya8f0a ( neapolitan kid sings about how much he loves nutella ) bonus : * https://youtu.be/jgspqcb4c-8 ( miss italy says she would have liked to live in 1942 cause she is a woman and would have n't fought ) * https://youtu.be/o3apprjxtiy ( japanese man tells a reporter he is japanese ), 
  i first thought it was pronounced `` google '' so i remember it for this reason , i love the way it sounds . 
   italy is a democratic republic , founded on work . 
   sovereignty belongs to the people , which exercises it in the forms and within the limits of the constitution . 
  the first part is kind of ironic now, 
  australia and new zealand have their beauty . 
  brie , gorgonzola , fontina , pecorino , grana padano , ricotta , ricotta mustia and mozzarella . 
  everybody says pizza but i ca n't so personally i would say paella , waffles , gyros , kebab and crepes !, 
  at parties talking about cocktails many people order long island , sex on the beach and vodka redbull . 
   corsica funny , i was wondering if corsica had independent movements like they have in sardinia . 
  they exist even in sardinia . 
  they have the slogan `` sardinia no est italia '' ( sardinia is not italy ) but i do n't know how many people would actually like to be independent . 
  is that considered a news anymore ? 
  i would like to visit nordic countries , sweden especially . 
  we invented banks and radio, 
  well , we have [ eurospin ] ( http://www.pesceinrete.com/php/images/news/eurospin.jpg ) it 's known because it 's very cheap especially for alcohol and beers . 
  they joke about it on facebook but tbh i have never seen one of those people you talked about . 
  anyway some alcohol addicts in my neighbourhood i think go there to buy wine . 
  in sardinia , as well as in the rest of italy , apart from the sardinian language there are several dialects sometimes based just on just a single city . 
  the island was dominated by ligurians , catalans and spaniards and their influence is still present in certain zones . 
  the spoken dialects are : * logudorese * campidanese * nuorese * sassarese * gallurese plus : * catalan * ligurian here 's a [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/sardinia_language_map.png ) our languages sardinian back in time was the most spoken language , even more than italian . 
  when i speak i usually do a mix of my local dialect and italian ( as everybody in italy , i think ) and i understand sardinian but ca n't speak it properly . 
  it is still spoken and understood by everybody but obviously they also know italian . 
  well , even this year your entry was definitely country . 
  oh yeah , i was mainly thinking about the balkans , you are obviously right . 
  talking in general , mediterranean people tend to have black/brown hair , tanned skin , brown eyes and are quite short . 
  people from central and northern europe are usually blonde , tall , have green/blue eyes and a very clear skin . 
  slavic people tend to have that the same features of mediterranean people but they are sometimes taller and have different somatic traits . 
  you can also identify the nationality of person by watching how they are dressed , russians for example tend to wear very expensive clothes and so on . 
  anyway you can find a swede with brown hair as you can find a blonde italian so it all depends , obviously . 
  for americans in general , no , maybe only for the states in the south but it 's not a common stereotype . 
  nobody would think a new yorker is a cowboy . 
  that kind of massage , no . 
  if it is done in a massage center hosted by chinese that is probably going to get closed in a few days for illegal prostitution , then maybe . 
  dude , someone has asked a person that i know what ocean flows through italy . 
  about the use of weed , here it 's a common stereotype , actually , it 's not that dutch are seen as drug addicts but amsterdam is considered a sort of paradise . 
  almost every teen wants to go there and it 's obviously not for the museums or its beauty . 
  talking about nordic people in general , they are considered very civil , responsible and rich . 
  apart from that , you tend to get sunburnt very badly everytime you go to seaside . 
  if i have to talk about each country : * norwegians : kill whales * finnish : do saunas , very shy * swedish : they are all blonde , eat weird fish * danish : love bicycles , hate swedes, 
  damn germany ... you forgot saunas !, 
  they are veneto 's biggest export, 
  i think we swear a lot . 
  i mean , it depends on people but , personally , when i speak with my friends i do swear . 
  we also have a lot of blasphemies and based on the region you might hear a lot of them ahah . 
  if you add these to dialect bad words , you get a beautiful mix of pure rudeness . 
   me cago en la puta madre que te pari\u00f3 aaah romance languages , how beautiful, 
  that 's cool . 
  used to be mosquitoes but they are not a problem anymore as i put mosquito nets on the windows , maybe some spiders . 
  i have to say , although they are not bugs , that i have sometimes found some geckos inside my house . 
  that 's a pity , but not that much because i never realized i had coins europe from so many countries . 
  because everything has 0,99 cents in the price, 
  i have this money box that is full of money but i had never checked where they came from , done this for the first time ever : * 1 euro : 1 x italy ; 1 spain * 50 cent : 3 x spain ; 2 x italy ; 1 x austria * 20 cent : 23 x italy ; 3 x france ; 3 x germany ; 2 x austria ; 1 x finland ; 1 x portugal ; 1 x slovakia ; 1 x spain ; 1 x the netherlands * 10 cent : 21 x italy ; 3 x germany ; 2 x spain ; 1 x belgium ; 1 x france ; 1 x greece ; * 5 cent : 10 x italy ; 2 x france ; 1 x germany ; 1 x ireland * 2 cent : 6 x italy ; 1 x the netherlands , 1 x austria * 1 cent : 5 x italy ; 1 x austria ** 13 countries : ** * italy : 68 * germany : 7 * spain : 7 * france : 6 * austria : 5 * the netherlands : 2 * belgium : 1 * finland : 1 * france : 1 * greece : 1 * ireland : 1 * portugal : 1 * slovakia : 1 the 2 coins from the netherlands ( 20 cent ; 2 cent ) have the text `` beatrix koningin der nederlanden '' , are they rare ? 
  ** total : ** 101, 
  love that series , i watch the italian version , `` braccialetti rossi '' , and is very well made , imo . 
  oh yeah , i 'm not sure if it 's italian or not but there 's a chain called '' [ old wild west ] ( http://www.italianosveglia.com/images/listing_photos/86045_00oldwildwest1.jpg ) '' that has a western theme , i also know this french chain called '' [ buffalo grill ] ( http://www.franchisesales.co.uk/franchiseimages/franchise2736/image2.jpg ) '' that is very similar .
