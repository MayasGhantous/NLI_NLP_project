  we ca n't compete , longest italian word is : `` precipitevolissimevolmente '' , that means excessively fast, 
  ah , thank you !, 
  i thought this expression did n't exist in english , added in my vocabulary, 
  must be a romance thing ahah , swearing in french must be so cool because even bad words sound sweet, 
  the expression is used here too, 
  you need to know the existence of this welsh city called : * llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, 
  vulgar way to say `` testicle '' , it 's used to indicate someone who is an idiot or a dumbass . 
  in formal expressions it 's used in the phrases `` giramento di coglioni '' and `` rompimento di coglioni '' that literally mean `` testicles turning '' and `` balls breaking '' , used to when someone is really annoying or boring . 
  the translation might be `` asshole '' but they are different body parts so it 's not right . 
  it 's a very useful word , trust me . 
  you kidding , i grew up watching that show , they even made one series about the human body but i do n't know its name . 
  one of the best kids show ever . 
  it 's like the thing every teacher make kids watch at school . 
  there are so many : * [ monster allergy ] ( https://youtu.be/6xwdbueqafg ) * [ la compagnia dei celestini ] ( https://youtu.be/w-yyexsitqc ) / street football ( favourite cartoon ) * [ huntik ] ( https://youtu.be/kjs4ynd8gco ) * [ tommy & oscar ] ( https://youtu.be/b4g3rfq7uuw ) * [ geronimo stilton ] ( https://youtu.be/wi5mujqwhw0 ) * [ lupo alberto ] ( https://youtu.be/qpr7wpq9gxk ) * [ code lyoko ] ( https://youtu.be/1rzmvdqxyvq ) * [ martin myst\u00e8re ] ( https://youtu.be/qd8q0thdufg ) ( also this , what a great show ) * [ team galaxy ] ( https://youtu.be/nr3sqpk1gbm ) * [ pap\u00e0 castoro ] ( https://youtu.be/bneaige6s7w ) / les histoires du p\u00e8re castor * [ c\u00e8dric ] ( https://youtu.be/ryg3adriuiu ) * [ martin matin ] ( https://youtu.be/rgplwkqkupm ) * [ titeuf ] ( https://youtu.be/quk8wdujz9q ) * [ pingu ] ( https://youtu.be/sct5j7quo54 ) * [ detective conan ] ( https://youtu.be/kzkfbkky7qk ) / case closed ( still a fan ) ** talking about teen series : ** * [ melevisione ] ( https://youtu.be/6sjsmw7sv3o ) one of my favourite , and imo , best italian show ever made . 
  * [ grani di pepe ] ( https://youtu.be/p50ykrqozc4 ) / die pfefferk\u00f6rner / the peppercorns ( i love this too ) italian cartoons used to be awesome , i realized they used to broadcast a lot of french cartoons but i do n't mind that , apparently rai and france t\u00e9l\u00e9visions used to switch cartoons with each other and even created some together . 
  i also used to watch many british cartoons like bob the builder , teletubbies ( favourite childhood show ) and postman pat . 
  plus disney channel , cartoon network and well known cartoons like the fairly oddparents , pokemon , digimon and dragonball . 
  it 's very common , cursive is considered the most good-looking way to write and teachers pretend students to write in it . 
  personally , after i finished middle school i started writing using print letters , i write faster in that way and i think it 's more readable compared to `` my '' curvise . 
  i find print letters clearer than it , i only write in cursive during tests , my notebooks would be a mess if i write only in it . 
  that 's how i learned how to write in cursive, 
  words with '' - gli '' like `` fo ** gli ** o '' ( sheet of paper ) , `` fo ** gli ** a '' ( leaf ) : many people instead of saying - glio/a say - io/ia . 
  it 's very common , i have a problem with it . 
  definitely interesting . 
  i think it 's the second most popular beer but also nastro azzurro is liked by many people, 
  being an italian and learning swedish would definitely be funny considering words like `` fika '' and `` kaka '', 
  oh thanks , edited that . 
  yeah absolutely , jokes about bitches are the norm when they teach that argument, 
  edited , thanks, 
  weird , i used google translate and it translated the word , anyway , kaka reminds the word `` poop '' so i 'll change that !, 
  my friend `` rutto '' means burp in italian , anyway here 's a list : * skopare : pair of shoes ( norwegian ) , to fuck ( italian ) * kuulo : hearing ( finnish ) , ass/butt ( italian ) * minkia : mink ( romanian , albanian ) dick ( italian ) * kojon : into the leg ( lithuanian ) vulgar way to say testicle ( italian ) * trojka/tr \u00f6ja : three ( bosnian ) sweater ( swedish ) bitch ( italian ) * kaka : cake/cookie ( swedish ) poop ( italian ), 
  definitely when you can easily go there by car , riding through central europe , or even better , by plane, 
  apparently the problem is the lack of funds . 
  there are a lot of backgrounds behind it , there 's a wikipedia page dedicated to it : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/strait_of_messina_bridge, 
  we ca n't build a bridge between sicily and calabria , imagine building that kind of tunnel, 
  i think moretti is the most popular beer here . 
  anyway , i 've found this map on the internet with the most popular beers by country : http://www.ilpost.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/birra4.png, 
  i mean it happens but i do n't think that often , tbh i heard more stories about teenagers dying by jumping off the balcony rather than tourists . 
  i think writing using your own alphabet is way better than using latin . 
  on important events like the olympics it 's necessary because most people use it , apart from that , you also have declensions and some letters that do n't exist in latin . 
  i have seen the `` greeklish '' and i have found it more complicated to read than the actual greek . 
  well that 's true , i have to confess that i did that too for the same reason , but when i visit a country i usually want to eat the food made there , eating lasagne in france did n't feel totally right for me, 
  i 'm almost sure they do that everywhere , it depends on people, 
  why ? 
  the most atrocious thing are tourists that go to italian restaurants in paris, 
  how could they think this was a good idea, 
  they do that to get noticed by foreign girls, 
  everything that concerns two consonants : * words with * - glio , - glia , - gliu * ( figlio `` son '' , foglia `` leaf '' ) ( i still have problems with this , i tend to not say the consonants and just pronounce the vowels , one of the biggest mistakes in italian grammar ) * words with * gn - * ( gnocchi ) * words with * sc - * ( scivolo `` slide '' ) * words wirh * - scia , - sciu , - scio * ( asciutto `` dry '' , sciocco `` silly '' ) * words with 3 consonants like * str - , spr - , scr - '' ( struzzo `` ostrich '' , spremuta `` squeezed '' ) * words with `` pn , ps , pr '' ( pneumatico `` tyre '' , psicologo `` psychologist '' , produttore `` producer '' ) ... 
  there are others but these are enough . 
  personally , as a kid , i also had , and still have , a problem with the letter `` x '' , i struggle so much pronouncing words like * extra * or * fuxia * ( fuchsia in english ) , i tend to not pronounce the sound `` ecs '' and just say `` es '' so instead of saying `` ecstra '' i say `` estra '' . 
  i sometimes feel uncomfortable for this . 
  we use a lot of loanwords , sometimes a bit too much if you ask me . 
  it depends , some words are pronounced like you would pronounce them in english ( like facebook ) but we mainly pronounce them like italian words . 
  social networks like snapchat or instagram are not pronounced like an english speaker would say them , we have a different pronunciation of the letter `` a '' . 
  it also happened that with the growth of social media english verbs got `` italianated '' , for example : * to chat , became * chattare * * to ban , became * bannare * english words usually sound so cool that even our government decided to call our new job law : `` job act '' instead of `` rforma del lavoro '' . 
  we sometimes use english words even when it exists the corresponding italian word and as long as i love the english language , i think it 's pointless . 
  ours is so much perfect that nobody drinks it to not make it bad, 
  definitely free healthcare , it 's absolutely the one thing that i 've always liked about my country , hope this will never change . 
  i should n't say this but san marino is really cute and nice , also , although it 's not that hidden , mont saint-michel in france is beautiful !, 
  obviously , the zones you quoted are good too but in general s\u00fcdtirol is considered the richest region, 
  we are beautiful , yes and we talk with our hands , yes ( not the way you think though ) . 
  talking about economy , probably `` trentino-alto adige '' , `` trento '' is the richest and the best city to live in italy according to newspapers edit : also bolzano, 
  i 'm sure nobody does that , maybe elders , it 's more a dinner dish . 
  it 's alright but sometimes a bit boring , i prefer going to international subs , also , although we are like 60,000,000 people in italy , there are few people that are active , post things and news . 
  but that 's also a reason why i love reddit , nobody that i know uses it . 
  tbh i never read the actual classic italian books , i really liked : * [ la solitudine dei numeri primi ] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_solitude_of_prime_numbers_ ( novel ) by paolo giordano * the solitude of prime numbers * in english * and i 'm currently reading [ sostiene pereira ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/pereira_maintains ) by antonio tabucchi * pereira maintains * in english, 
  not * le petit prince * ? 
  san marino for australia , or better , vatican city . 
  aussies are cool . 
  of course , we eat pasta but definitely not at breakfast . 
  i know elders in my region that eat soup or whatever they did n't eat for dinner but i honestly just need a cup of milk or coffee , some biscuits and i 'm fine . 
  i honestly do n't see the problem with eating pasta at dinner , a big plate of `` spaghetti alla carbonara '' is what i need at the end of the day !, 
  i honestly ca n't think of many acronyms , just a few : * cmq = comunque ( anyway ) * nn = non ( not ) * apparently it was too long * * xk\u00e9 = perch\u00e9 ( why ), 
  i 'm sure they did but as the others said when i have to write something i think about how it sounds in my mind and if it sounds wrong i change it, 
  i like pineapple pizza, 
  never been in veneto so i do n't know , why ? 
  yes , it is . 
  it 's even the only with 2,000,000 people in italy . 
  second biggest is milan with around 1,000,000 people . 
  tbh , i 've never heard it , maybe it 's more common in the north , i do n't know . 
  sorry , my bad ahah, 
  apparently `` quad '' comes from english and it 's an abbrevation for `` quadruple '', 
  it has a future as a eurovision song, 
  history . 
  naples is badville milan is fogville rome is ... 
  i do n't know , the people who live there usually consider it the biggest city in the country so maybe they are a bit presumptuous , also , they ca n't stand the fact that milan is being more important, 
  everyone !, 
  we are also taking a petition to change the religion of vatican city to make it an european mecca !, 
  anyway , we will make the place blow up if they do n't agree . 
  there are many , some people say they are police officers , some say they are part of the income revenue authority or some simply ask for a glass of water . 
  i think few people still get scammed , they are constantly telling elders to not open the door to strangers . 
  anyway i do n't live in a big city so i definitely know the half of the scams that might exist in bigger cities, 
  i did n't remember darude was finnish ahah i actually really like that song, 
  i have heard many people also like queen and rolling stones but not sure about it, 
  lol ahahah well , right now definitely but back then , she was very [ gorgeous ] ( http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/03/54bc1ecec0311_-_hbz-sophia-loren-20-1964-rexusa-210677bq-xl.jpg ), 
  anyway italians and portuguese get along well too southern europe axis confirmed, 
  i like these : * [ bomboloni alla nutella ] ( http://blog.giallozafferano.it/vickyart/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bomboloni-nutella-senza-patate-4.jpg ) * [ cardinali ] ( http://forum-ricette.cookaround.com/foto/data/8000/dscn00338.jpg ) * [ pesche ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_q2eyjzbvs8y/soyvxphc-6i/aaaaaaaaclc/a3mnjclwfnm/s320/p1060424.jpg ) and i add [ cassata siciliana ] ( http://www.gelarmony.it/public/images/cassata-siciliana.jpg ) and [ bab\u00e0 ] ( http://lacucinadirob.altervista.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/bab\u00e0.jpeg ) although i never had them but they are very popular, 
  mm i honestly do n't know what to say, 
  bucharest never fell !!, 
  true .
