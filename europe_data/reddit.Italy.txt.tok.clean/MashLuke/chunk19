  plus vatican, 
  i 'm realizing the question sounds weird but i have written it naively . 
  i have never directly met someone with a different colour skin so i was just curious about it . 
  i agree with you . 
  i have been to paris twice but when i travelled around normandy and brittany it was beautiful . 
  france is an amazing country . 
  also , every spanish city is different from the others , beautiful architecture , good food and atmosphere . 
  uk , the land of right-hand drive , weird sockets and pavements covered with carpet, 
  miss italia is very popular . 
  the winner usually becomes `` famous '' and becomes a model or something . 
  i think recently it 's becoming a little bit shittier than it has always been . . last year a contestant told the judges she would have liked to be born in 1942 to see the war , because she is a woman and she would have not fought in it . 
  they do that here too , but i think many do it to reduce the alcohol inside the wine , especially when they have to drive . 
  i wrote that because , technically , you become an adult when you are 18 , although you are still a teen . 
  prague is like the mecca for young adults in high school who want to get drunk, 
  football fans in general are n't good people , some of them in italy even have relationships with the mafia , not going to say anymore . 
  i have n't a bad opinion about dutch , if i 'm right , after what happened many people made a whip-round to pay the damages done to the fountain . 
  i mean it 's a nice ornament , do n't you think ? 
  it looks like you are talking about italians , a person that i know stole a towelling robe , while another stole the sign that said : `` free wifi '', 
  ah americans , they would add ketchup to everything, 
  i do say that too but not for everything like people think : * `` and that 's the colosseum '' `` mamma mia ! '', 
  * `` oh no , there 's ketchup on pasta '' `` mamma mia ! '', 
  * `` what was the name of that abba 's song '' `` mamma mia ! '', 
  i ca n't believe you know him ahahah, 
  coglione is my favourite, 
  i would say dutch football fans because they destroyed a fountain in rome http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/rome-dutch-feyenoord-fans-permanently-damage-newly-restored-barcaccia-fountain-rampage-1488849, 
  they are asians , who knows why, 
  have we found the new definition of italy ? 
  japanese and chinese take pictures of pidgeons and garbage bags when they are in italy and in their homelands , when they see a black man wearing a basket jersey , they think he 's a nba player . 
  do you think they are going to wonder if `` sombrero '' is a spanish thing ? 
  buying a sombrero in spain is like buying a boomerang in the uk, 
  also that ahah , now i 'm wondering how many tourists do it . 
  i just do n't think it tastes good . 
  i wonder how many people do that , yuk, 
  what 's this ? 
  also , do n't speak with a stereotypical italian accent , nobody speaks like that . 
  personally cardiff is the most beautiful english city . 
  fiume is still ours !, 
  thinking about it , italy and the nearest balkan countries fought many wars to conquer some cities , we are all landstealers after all . . 
  although you more than us, 
  still at school and apart from being boring , because i assume almost everybody found it boring , it 's also extremely hard and what they teach is sometimes ... unuseful . 
  from the first year in high school , or even in middle school , i always had to study a lot . 
  this year i spent entire days studying from 15pm to 21pm and i continued even after dinner . 
  i was always tired , because i also do sport , and some day i could n't handle the stress . 
  in addition to this , this year there has been a revolution in our school system . 
  our pm had the cool idea to make teens go to work , from the third year of secondary school , to `` introduce '' us in the world of work . 
  so , apart from doing my homeworks , i had to work 70 hours in a book shop , for free , just because . 
  it was n't a bad experience either but if you ask : `` do you know more about the world of work now ? '', 
  this law says that in the last 3 years of secondary school we must do 200 hours for high school students , 400 for professional institute students , and if we do n't do it we ca n't graduate . 
  teachers were mad because we could n't study everyday , because we were working , and it happened that in 2 weeks i had 7 tests because they were late with the program . 
  also , many teachers are n't able to teach , seriously . 
  this english teacher at my school , that still works , says things like : `` open the port '' or `` close the finestr '' , mixing italian with english . 
  to not talk about my latin teacher that barely does his work , when he hears a bit of noise he ends up in a sort of depression , he stops talking , he keeps quiet and let everybody chat . 
  they get paid for this . 
  there are other things but it would be too long to write everything , in the end , our school system is old , unuseful things are taught , many teachers are incompetents , or do n't care about doing a good work , it 's too harsh and stressful and all this work , at the moment , is not worth it . 
  we fought in 2006 in germany and guess who won ... :p, 
  yes but he 's from argetina , he speaks italian but he 's not fluent : check this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amaq6pi0se8 the pope that became famous for mispronouncing italian words is pope john paul ii that during his first day as a pope told the crowd : `` se mi sbaglio mi corrigerete '' that it 's like saying in english : `` if i sey something rong you will corect me '' video , skip to 2:00 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgutooon7xe, 
  yep , in fact they do n't use their biggest invention after the guillotine, 
  first trieste and now pizza ? 
  you evil !, 
  it 's just unusual for us, 
  it may be . 
  we also use [ bidet ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/bidet_weiss.jpg/800px-bidet_weiss.jpg ) that is only used in southern europe . 
  because the pope is always foreign and he usually mispronounces some words when he speaks italian, 
  1 ) do n't know , in general we consider ourselves the cleanest people in europe so we tend to think that the others are dirtier than us . 
  they say the same thing about germans and british . 
  try to google in italian : * * insert name * non = * insert name * do n't one of the first results always says : * * insert name * non si lavano = * insert name * do n't wash themselves 2 ) we usually have two bathrooms , so if someone is taking a shower , there 's always the other . 
  i find weird that when i finish i have to go to another room just to wash my hands . 
  also , you , as well as english people , are known for not using [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/bidet_weiss.jpg/800px-bidet_weiss.jpg ), 
  i have n't that much to say , they are probably too religious if you ask me , also , their leader should take elocution lessons . 
  we no speak americano, 
  ** swiss : ** rich , everything is expensive there , good at winter sports , also famous for this chocolate [ ad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cozj7l_wvc8 ) ** french : ** snobs , they take few showers , they are the weirdos that have a room only for the toilet , some women are hairy ** san marino : ** they hate us , banks ~ ~ ** austrians : ** ~ ~ ** mountain germans : ** good at winter sports ** slovenia : ** ? 
  yes it is . 
  it 's the most loved genre between teens and it 's one of our biggest music business . 
  i do n't think it 's that popular outside of italy but there are many popular italian rappers that are successful . 
  some of them : * [ fabri fibra ] ( https://youtu.be/brmnr7lwxgu ) * [ caparezza ] ( https://youtu.be/edchk6jhfzq ) * [ fedez ] ( https://youtu.be/relqxv8m_cc ) * [ salmo ] ( https://youtu.be/litcl3owchq ) * [ j-ax ] ( https://youtu.be/yrtpl9addrk ) * [ marracash ] ( https://youtu.be/du732pbggv8 ) * [ club dogo ] ( https://youtu.be/gipw8lwpu5a ) * [ gemitaiz ] ( https://youtu.be/jjrhufpuxzm ) * [ emis killa ] ( https://youtu.be/vlfnl5ctfoe ), 
  true . 
  i feel that you are honest , just do n't pay too much attention to it , people on the internet are weird all the time . 
  you do n't have to hide your nationality , it would be interesting to see how people talk to you without knowing that you are american but do n't do that because of stupid downvotes . 
  maybe try to not mention `` america '' when it 's possible , i think that will reduce your downvotes , because i noticed that your negative comments contain that word . 
  also , if it can make you feel any better , i upvoted your comments on / r/europe . 
  yeah , that 's the kind of comments that usually get downvoted, 
  i honestly think people sometimes just downvote posts or comments because they are written by americans . 
  i actually do n't mind the presence of americans in / r/europe , if you want to learn about our society and culture , you are welcome . 
  i think some people do n't like all these comparisons between the us and europe , if they are not constructive . 
  many others may perceive an american comment , like yours , that says something positive about your country like : `` yo bros , muricans are better than yuropeans ! '', 
  i guess for them an american in an european subreddit is like a meat-eater at a vegan convention , inappropriate . 
  i never downvoted someone , if i do n't like a comment i just ignore it , unless it 's racist or really offensive . 
  yours is way far from being offensive . 
  sweden or norway !, 
  southern europe and the mediterranean environment are completely different from the scandinavian landscapes so i would love go there , they look so attractive . 
  also central europe looks amazing , especially germany and czech republic , but sweden looks so nice . 
  i live in a hot region so living in a cold country would be completely different , and interesting . 
  the [ swedish ] ( https://www.passportindex.org/byregion.php?country=se ) one looks nice . 
  also , [ the vacitan passport ] ( https://www.passportindex.org/byregion.php?country=va ) looks classy . 
  i know but op asked for officially recognised languages . 
  i searched on wikipedia to be sure of what i was writing althought i know there are more languages in italy, 
  one official - italian however , because of our variety of dialects and languages each region has some idioms that are promoted by our regional governments and some are even recognised languages : * aosta valley : french ( the second official language in the region ) , german * piedmont : piedmontese * promoted : * occitan , franco proven\u00e7al , walser * friuli-venezia giulia : * promoted : * friulan , slovene , german , venetian : * veneto : venetian * sardinia : sardinian , sassarese , gallurese , catalan , tabarchino * sicily : sicilian * trentino-alto adige/s \u00fcdtirol : german ( the second official language in the region ) , ladin , cimbrian , m\u00f2cheno * campanian : * promoted : * neapolitan * apulia : salentino greek , arb\u00ebreshe , franco proven\u00e7al, 
  first of all , you do n't do sports at school . 
  there are sports associations that get paid to make children learn and practice a sport and these companies run fields , swimming pools , courts , based on what they do . 
  grappling sports are popular , especially judo and boxing .
