  at the olympics for example , we win at least 1 medal in judo . 
  british grammar at school but i know a lot of american slang words so i sometimes do a mixture of both . 
  when i write anyway i prefer the `` british '' words . 
  maybe , but at least we directly go to the final, 
  san marino is a bunch of italians who do n't feel italians and that sends bad songs at the eurovision song contest, 
  it depends . 
  police may be seen as a bunch of men who do n't really care about doing their work , who sometimes abuse of their power , or as a good and trusted force . 
  personally , many police officers do n't really do a good job , but that happens in every job i guess . 
  non-practicing christian , who does n't pay attention to religion that much , confused about the existence of god , so i like to consider myself an agnostic . 
  do n't be disrespectful to the monuments or to the museums . 
  writing your name into the colosseum or taking a bath in the trevi fountain it 's not cool , it 's a dickmove . 
  that actually does n't surprise me , only about hospitality or even about other things ? 
  oh god this definitely sounds like italian-english ahahah, 
  sardinia . 
  you would be surprised to know how many people think that and how many times i 've heard someone saying that if we kept the lira our economical system would be better . 
  i was thinking about it but i honestly watched it and i found it really boring ... 
  i mean , it also won an academy award but , i do n't know , it 's very hard to watch . 
  it depends . 
  we are very hospitable if you are a good person , be an idiot and you are screwed . 
  the ones you said are also beautiful films !, 
  personally , i really love [ the intouchables ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_intouchables ) . 
  it 's probably not the best french film ever but it 's pretty genuine , clever and funny . 
  i always watch it when they broadcast it on tv . 
  i love it too , it 's different from the other holocaust films , it 's both sad and funny . 
  it talks about a hard topic with simplicity and sweetness . 
  it shows the cruelty of that time to jews but without making it too harsh . 
  it 's beautiful . 
  * [ ** life is beautiful ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/life_is_beautiful ) ( 1997 ) it 's a comedy-drama film directed by and starring roberto benigni , who co-wrote the film with vincenzo cerami .

  * [ ** la dolce vita ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_dolce_vita ) ( 1960 ) it 's a comedy-drama film directed and co-written by federico fellini .

  la dolce vita won the palme d'or ( golden palm ) at the 1960 cannes film festival and the oscar for best costumes , and remains one of the most critically acclaimed films of all time * [ ** the good , the bad and the ugly ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_good,_the_bad_and_the_ugly ) ( 1966 ) i think you know this for sure . 
  it 's an epic spaghetti western film directed by sergio leone , starring clint eastwood , lee van cleef , and eli wallach in the title roles respectively . 
  it 's one of the most influential western films and one of the greatests of all time . 
  its soundtrack , composed by ennio morricone , is one of the most iconic film 's score ever made . 
  should i add anything else ? 
  does `` one '' list count as `` one '' thing ? 
  1 ) the influence the church and christians have to our political decisions . 
  2 ) the fear of diversity against homosexuals and black people . 
  3 ) the corruption and the mentality that it 's cooler not paying taxes than actually paying them , also the fact that if you do n't do that you are doing a sort of `` rebellion '' against the government . 
  4 ) the freedom of the press to talk about certain topics . 
  5 ) the educational system that literally stresses the shit out of kids without preparing them to the world of work . 
  also , the way some teachers prefer and tend to help more the sons of rich adults , discriminating the others , how some people are completely inadequate to teach , and how studying is considered `` stupid '' and useless while copying is clever . 
  6 ) how our national tv is focused too much to an old audience and does n't pay attention to younger generations . 
  7 ) how eu is seen as a `` trap '' and how many people think that the situation would be better if we did n't join it . 
  also , how many people think that when there was `` him '' italy was better than now with a democracy . 
  8 ) how many people do n't care about the environment , pollute the beaches and throw the garbage in the streets . 
  9 ) the general ignorance . 
  10 ) final thing , how many people complain about everything that happens in italy when they are the first to not do anything to improve our situation , maybe making it worse . 
  honestly at the moment i think we have n't done anything `` bad '' . 
  we had problems before and we still have problems , we did nothing worse or better . 
  when someone dies they usually put the body in a coffin without closing it , then they bring it inside a room called `` camera ardente '' , literally `` burning room '' ( do n't know the exact noun in english , sorry ) , where the relatives and close people of the victim can `` visit '' the gone person and say a last goodbye . 
  at the end of the day they close it . 
  the funeral is held in a church of choice where it 's celebrated a mass to remember the dead , everybody brings flowers and place them near the coffin . 
  when it finishes everybody goes outside and waits for the coffin to be brought inside the hearse . 
  the hearse goes directly to the cemetery and everybody follows it with their own car . 
  at the cemetery the body is buried by the gravedigger and all the people stand near to it waiting for it to be covered by the ground . 
  at the end of it , everybody goes maybe at a caf\u00e9 or everywhere else because it 's tradition that after a funeral you have to go into another place to `` ward off evil . '', 
  then everybody goes home . 
  for the first months a ceremony is held the day the person died to remember him/her . 
  than each year it 's celebrated an anniversary . 
  what 's more european than an european rock group called europe ? 
  [ love love peace peace ] ( https://youtu.be/amgw54hbos0 ) has a special place in our hearts also : [ marc-antoine charpentier - te deum ] ( https://youtu.be/iwu37osokqa ) this is the official ebu theme song, 
  i never bothered about it but i have friends that watched me like a weirdo when i told them . 
  i wish it was a bit more like that, 
  walking naked , maybe after a shower , or only wearing underwear in front of your parents or siblings . 
  when i was in spain the taxi-driver started talking about politics while driving . 
  that 's understandable and not surprising though , also here everything the government does is considered bad and gets criticized , also on facebook there are two types of people : * the ones who offend italians * the ones who offend who offend italians many people think that we have one of the most beautiful cultures in the world but we are the first to hate it . 
  i think it 's just the theory that the grass of the neighbor is always greener, 
  it looks like you have never been to italy, 
  what you said is really helpful !, 
  i know it 's not easy but it 's the only thing i 'm sure i 've always liked doing . 
  now i 'm continuously trying to improve my english , that is the essential , and then i would like to study ( apart from french and spanish ) maybe german and russian . 
  asian languages are also very interesting although they are way harder to learn , but chinese and japanese will be more important than they are right now , as well as arabic . 
  who knows , i still have a couple years to decide what to do but i 'm almost completely sure this is what i want . 
  thanks !, 
  i have always liked studying english since primary school and that 's also why i use reddit a lot , it 's a good way to improve my skills, 
  i mean , it depends . 
  it 's not only that you would not do that in front of an elderly couple or in a restaurant it 's also the way you do . 
  if you for example are in a bus and start screaming bad words everybody will think you are rude . 
  swearing , if used in the right moment is not that big deal , honestly when i 'm in a restaurant and i speak to someone , if i want to , i swear . 
  also with all the beautiful dialect words we have , why not use them ? 
  do n't know right now , i love foreign languages so i would definitely like to study them and maybe become a translator but i still have time to decide . 
  aargh , i forgot them . 
  i spent almost 30 minutes trying to cover the image with `` pizza '', 
  the comments ahah , poor dude , hope he had a nice stay in ireland, 
  yes we have them . 
  wiki says they were introduced into the us from china and then they were spread around the world . 
  i think that after all germany is the worst victim of ww2 . 
  the following years were frightening . 
  ah yeah , the dude that thought he was hercules, 
  italians descend from every population that lived in italy , not only lombards . 
  i do n't get the downvote anyway, 
  i was waiting someone to notice it, 
  holocaust obviously and the italian colonies in africa . 
  a stupid waste of people . 
  i 'm mainly ashamed of what italians have done to italy itself , all the domestic terrorism like the murder of giovanni falcone and paolo borsellino , two judges that were fighting the mafia in sicily , or the terrorist attack in bologna held by neo-fascist that is the fourth deadliest terrorist attack in western europe . 
  the after war was sometimes worse than the actual war .
