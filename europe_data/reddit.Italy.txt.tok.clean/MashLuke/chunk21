  martyn myst\u00e9re is love, 
  alright , i 'll ask on r/outoftheloop, 
  american sports are actually very followed . 
  there are a lot of basketball fans that follow every year the nba , and also the nfl is followed but a big amount of people . 
  personally i like swimming so it happened that i watched the swimming trials . 
  hockey and baseball are not popular in italy , i think hockey is popular in northern europe but i 'm not sure , but the us is well seen in sports especially in basketball , i ca n't describe how many people walk around wearing a basket jersey . 
  it 's funny though that for a country as big as europe you ca n't form a strong football team , but you would probably beat us in a basketball game so that 's fine . 
  is it the same if i do that with training wheels on ? 
  we tend to support every sport , especially at the olympics , but the most followed are : 1 . 
  football ( soccer for you ) 2 . 
  basketball ( less than football but very followed ) that 's it , i would also add swimming , rugby , cycling and tennis but it all depends on people . 
  one thing is certain , everybody here loves football . 
  for an average italian the year is scheduled in this way : ** autumn : ** the serie a is starting ** winter : ** the serie a is started ** spring : ** the serie a is ending ** summer : ** * my team won , let 's celebrate !, 
  * my team lost , fuck it , it 's all about corruption * champions leauge !, 
  ( occasionally world cup and euro cup ) + football market is starting !, 
  ps : serie a is the italian football championship , cheers, 
  i prefer the less patriotic , hilarious ahah, 
  that 's interesting, 
  that 's a classic, 
  god , is this heaven ? 
  i did this when i answered on askreddit : http://i.imgur.com/fxr9i12.jpg, 
  you asked for it : * pizza , frittata * espresso , cassata * grissini , lasagne , rag\u00f9 * focaccia , ricotta , * and the panna cotta , * pandoro e tiramis\u00f9 * cannoli , bruschetta * and the cotoletta * parmigiano e canneloni * grissini , piadina * and the fiorentina , * torrone e maccheroni, 
  why ? 
  pff i do n't know , there 's a long list of things that are not available . 
  i had skittles for the first time in the uk and i loved them , but they do n't sell them in italy . 
  also you wo n't ever find brands like milky way , wonka , cheetos or hersheys . 
  although this the thing that makes me angry is the variety of oreos you have . 
  we only have the classic ones . 
  anyway we have nutella bread sticks so i am not completely desperate . 
  i immediately wanted a pizza after i wrote this, 
  no you are right , i think it 's the norm in southern europe, 
  that 's how it works in italy . 
  the limit is 18 even for beers but usually at shops they sell alcohol to underage people including vodka and gin . 
  it 's definitely not good , but it 's a common thing . 
  the majority of the times when kids want to buy alcohol they say : `` you are all eighteen right ? 
  yeah , of course '' without asking for id . 
  well maybe the second , or fourth considering macarons and cr\u00eapes, 
  i do n't know but i do n't think it 's true , i mean , wikipedia does n't talk about this, 
  the italian flag is derivated by the french flag after napoleon brought it in the peninsula . 
  then the blue got replaced by green because it was the colour of milanese soldiers uniforms . 
  then they gave this meaning to the flag : * green represents hope * white represents faith * red represents love it 's the only think i have to thank france to because i really like my flag, 
  i personally wo n't ever kiss someone in the cheek if it 's not a very close person . 
  we also shake hands obviously but for example nobody would kiss his teacher o work boss in the cheek , unless you have a certain type of relationship that makes it legit . 
  i understand a bit of sardinian language but i ca n't speak it , i have to say though that technically sardinian is not a dialect but a language , it 's the closest language to latin , even closer than italian that is the second one . 
  i also speak and understand a bit of `` sassarese '' that is the dialect spoken in northern sardinia in the city of sassari and it 's basically a mixture of corsican and sardinian . 
  i do n't know that much but when i talk to someone i usually say something in my dialect . 
  sardinian dialect is very strong because we tend to pronunciate consonants way harder than the other italian speakers , when i have been to milan they immediately understood where i came from . 
  also we tend to put verbs at the end of the sentences and that 's a thing i often do when i get angry and i let my dialectic spirit come alive , example : * ho mangiato una pizza ( i ate a pizza ) * italian * * una pizza ho mangiato ( a pizza i ate ) * sardinian *, 
  i just wash them with tap water, 
  wait , what ? 
  then search yung lean ( sweden ) , salmo ( italy ) , cro ( germany ) , supreme nmt ( france ) , sido ( germany ) , martoria ( germany ) , fabri fibra ( italy ) , marracash ( italy ) , mc soolar ( france ) , fedez ( italy ) , seeed ( germany ), 
  ~ ~ stockholm ? ~ ~ ~ ~ berlin ? ~ ~ ~ ~ oslo ? ~ ~ ~ ~ reykjavik ? ~ ~ spain ? 
  ~ ~ portugal ? ~ ~ ~ ~ italy ? ~ ~ ~ ~ france ? ~ ~ ~ ~ vienna ? ~ ~ we have a winner !, 
  ~ ~ stockholm ? ~ ~ ~ ~ berlin ? ~ ~ ~ ~ oslo ? ~ ~ ~ ~ reykjavik ? ~ ~ spain ? 
  portugal ? 
  ~ ~ italy ? ~ ~ ~ ~ france ? ~ ~ ~ ~ vienna ? ~ ~ it 's rainy in northern italy , rome and milan are n't sunny in november, 
  here it 's the normality , when you see a relative , after you said `` hi '' to them , you greet them by kissing them on both cheeks . 
  also girls usually say goodbye to boys by cheek kissing them . 
  you do n't do that to everyone just to very close people . 
  i honestly find more weird russians that greet people by kissing them on the lips although i think nobody does that now, 
  we are classy , bread with [ salami and fontina ( italian cheese ) ] ( http://www.manifestazionesanfioranese.com/content/sites/all/images/menu/panino-salame.jpg ) or ham and fontina . 
  these are the most common . 
  why do you think that ? 
  alright , where do i have to sign to go there ? 
  i 'm not used to this . 
  people go to work around 8/8 :30 , lunch is around 13/14 , and dinner is around 21/22 . 
  with two breaks at 11am and the other at 17/18 . 
  also beer , very good beer, 
  that 's basically how it works in italy too, 
  it depends , only english or even in another language ? 
  i mean what 's the best country for living , i 'm not talking about changing country just what 's the best place for a teen to live in, 
  also why have you dinner at 18pm ? 
  i usually have a snack at that time and then dinner later . 
  man , i have no clue . 
  it is a soft cheese that has a spicy flavour and i can confirm it is very very good but let 's be honest you wo n't ever find a cheese with bugs inside european supermarkets . 
  but if you want to try it , you wo n't regret it !, 
  it depends on the territory , some add ricotta , some add milk , some add chocolate , it changes throughout the country, 
  they are alive , that 's the problem ahah . 
  serious question , have you ever thought about sending the winner of x factor uk or of the voice to the eurovision ? 
  you would have won way more times , seriously you have very talented artists !, 
  [ emma marrone - la mia citt\u00e0 ] ( https://youtu.be/8w5zlalamv8 ) ( 2014 ) she even did not partecipate to fucking sanremo festival but rai thought she was perfect for the esc . 
  i honestly think she had way better songs than this one before joining the contest , however , they thought the song was good apparently . 
  she arrived 21st making it the worst result ever in the eurovision song contest for italy and gave us one of the most awkward perfomances ever , thank you emma !, 
  i think it 's made only in sardinia , that is basically the land of unusual foods in italy . 
  it 's very good , i can confirm, 
  same thing here especially for cheese and cold cuts, 
  well corsica and sardinia are very close to each other , they just speak different languages, 
  here , i do n't remember exactly how it 's made or how it 's called , we make cheese inside the goat 's stomach, 
  here we also have this thing called [ `` cordula '' ] ( http://www.sardegnaricette.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/img_2945.jpg ) made with lamb 's intestines and stomachs then laced together to form a big twist , then it is [ cooked around a spit ] ( https://sardegnaremix.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/000000012.jpg ) or [ cooked with tomato sause and peas ] ( http://www.ricettesardegna.it/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/cordula-piselli.jpg ) . 
  one of the best things we have here !, 
  well ... 
  i forgot about that ... we still cook everything though, 
  god that stargazey pie with the fish heads outside was strange ahah , i hope it tastes good at least . 
  oh yeah , i love sea urchins !, 
  they do n't know how delicious they are , where i live we put them in everything , spaghetti , pizza , bread ... 
  the only bad thing about them is that they are incredibly expensive, 
  raw fish is very good , anyway that must give you one of the worst breathe ever in your mouth ahah, 
  i had lamb 's head several times and i 've even eaten its brain so this does n't seem too weird to me, 
  here too we have blood sausage and it 's called [ sanguinaccio ] ( https://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sanguinaccio_insaccato ) . 
  about the pig chips i 'm curious about them,
