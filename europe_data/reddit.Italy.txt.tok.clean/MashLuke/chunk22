  searched it , that looks actually good !, 
  not me personally but even in my english book there was a discussion between some of the characters about haggis and his strange form and structure . 
  i guess for some people it 's weird eating animal offals but i have not a problem with it . 
  anyway it is far from an ordinary sausage but i would like to try it, 
  mmh no clue , i have done a research right now and i found this festival in france called `` world trance winter 2016 '' so i guess it 's what you are looking for , check more informations here , also this website has all the festivals of the year , hope i 've been helpful : https://www.festicket.com/festival/world-trance-winter-2016/ anyway the netherlands are the land of electronic dance music festivals especially for trance so try to see if there 's something in amsterdam . 
  i think the weirdest thing you have in the uk is `` haggis '' but i 've heard it 's very good, 
  instead of eating raw meat we tend to cook and eat every part of the animals , and i mean everything . 
  oh they look amazing honestly , here we have a similar thing but made with `` lamb feet '' seasoned with tomato sauce , vinegar , oil , garlic and chili pepper, 
  i 've definetely heard of surstr\u00f6mming and of lutefisk , they are usually eaten by youtubers or people on the internet because of their weird taste . 
  because they let the `` cheese fly '' spawn its eggs inside the cheese , then the larvae start eating it inside and they release an enzyme that makes the `` pecorino '' very soft . 
  when it 's ready it happens that these larvae are still alive , also this bug is known because it attacks every type of cheese completely destroying big amounts of cheese wheels because they infect them . 
  in few words it 's dangerous because you are eating gone bad cheese . 
  still very good though . 
  that must give you diabetes in a single bite . 
  but it sounds very appealing , it would definetely be worth it, 
  in sardinia we have this cheese called `` casu marzu '' that means `` rotten putrid cheese '' and it is made with live insect larvae . 
  these larvae are deliberately introduced to the cheese , promoting an advanced level of fermentation and breaking down of the cheese 's fats . 
  it was banned the european union and it 's considered the most dangerous cheese in the world by guinness world record . 
  i had the occasion to taste it and it 's very good , is very soft and a bit spicy , great with bread . 
  made with unusual ingredients or simply a bit weird compared to the ordinary european dishes, 
  when you are stucked in the traffic you can hear the most creative imprecations ever , i think we should do a contest for it edit : grammar, 
  come here !, 
  we are so chill that even our government takes things way less seriously !, 
  i think it just depends , obviously big cities like paris or milan tend to be cleaner bevause they have to look nice for tourists but also because there are lot of people who live there it 's necessary to clean the streets more often . 
  i live in a city of 100.000 people and it 's not that clean so it 's all about perspective imo, 
  i get that but i think almost everybody can understand a post related to europe in general , anyway i also know that not everybody likes memes so that 's fine, 
  i do n't know , personally i have the impression that you ca n't talk about many things in tv and on journals . 
  it recently happened that rai ( our national tv ) has censored a gay sex scene of an american tv series , compromising the whole plot . 
  christianity is still a big `` problem '' here because some topics that go against religion are sometimes censored or taken way less seriously . 
  also i read some news about my country that i would have never known anything about if i had n't been subscribed on reddit . 
  ** san marino : ** just a bunch of italians who for some reason do n't consider themselves italian , also they never vote us at eurovision . 
  ** vatican city : ** good place i guess , what can i say about it ? 
  ** slovenia : ** not that much to say but i guess trieste 's people do n't really like it . 
  i 've heard lubiana is very cute though ** switzerland : ** chocolate i guess ? 
  it 's the only thing i can think of because is hella good . 
  ** austria : ** they had some big problems in the past ( maybe just one big problem ) but they are fine now . 
  never been there so i do n't know what to say . 
  ** france : ** very beautiful thanks to our presence :p, 
  fluent italian and then ... english . 
  i would love to learn at least the most popular languages like french , spanish . . and then i would love to study the others , being polyglottal is like a dream . 
  * paris * madrid * prague * lisbon * rome would love to go above and visit scandinavia . 
  i have to say that i went to london but just passed throught it , i was inside a bus and i `` visited '' it very , very , very , quickly , so i want to see more . 
  also i want to go to berlin , amsterdam and brussels but every country is so interesting and beautiful . 
  spain i guess , but also portugal . 
  oh yeah you are right , i had n't thought about that, 
  budapest and prague but if you like going to the seaside also croatia and greece . 
  yeah i get that , i know adjectives like `` fruity '' , `` cheesy '' , `` corny '' but i never heard this word before , well there 's always something new to learn, 
  61 % , i clicked no on some words that i thought were jokes like `` oniony '' , are all of these common ? 
  right now ice cream , especially this flavour that the ice-cream parlour where i go has that is made of plain ice cream with white chocolate and nutella . 
  addicted . 
  first time i noticed it, 
  this is actually the first time i realized that one part of kazakhstan is situated in europe . 
  then why they never joined european associations while other non-european countries did ? 
  mm do n't know , their industry i guess . 
  films and music are always on point , they have creative people . 
  also the geography is beautiful , so many national parks but apart from that , not that much . 
  i think american culture is a mixture of all the cultures of the poeple who went there and then it happened to turn into its own thing . 
  australia . 
  it looks very interesting do n't know why , it 's at the bottom of the world but it has its own natural environment and culture . 
  also new zealand looks nice and different, 
  sardinia !, 
  it 's beautiful but unfortunately a bit expensive compared to sicily i guess . 
  i was thinking about her but i dediced to comment with something more classical but yeah this song is huge , everybody here knows its lyrics . 
  it 's not the best song ever but german sounds so catchy in this [ song ] ( https://youtu.be/8wqmbv2deyq ) and i really like it, 
  mainly for having very beautiful women , alcohol and also for another thing that people love watching when they are alone , if you know what i mean . 
  hungary is particularly considered like `` the country of porn '' especially because of ilona staller , a hungarian porn star that even became a member of the italian parlament , and also because it 's known that rocco siffredi has founded a porn school in budapest . 
  i also have to say that many people consider it quite poor , here there are many kids that have been adopted from belarus , russia , poland and ukraine , especially after the chernobyl disaster , although it 's also known that russians , for example , are very rich . 
  apart from all these unglorious things eastern europe is also known for its literature , classical music , beer and food . 
  well when something is good, 
  male : * [ domenico modugno - nel blu dipinto di blu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ukht0n1aii ) he joined the esc and arrived third , the song becomes popular in the us , it became the best-selling song that year in the states . 
  * [ andrea bocelli - con te partir\u00f2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_1xhrocd34 ) we can all agree that he has a beautiful voice . 
  female : * [ gigliola cinquetti - non ho l'et\u00e0 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptbw7zymyfm ) one of the two songs that won the eurovision song contest for italy . 
  * [ loretta goggi - maledetta primavera ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmtw8gbalz4 ) one of the most known italian songs , especially known is its spanish version . 
  i would love to tell you italy but it all depends if you can get a job , hard thing to do even for italians . 
  the fun thing is that i knew within temptation but i never heard of lacuna coil , that 's crazy because they sound really good . 
  i like francesca michielin !, 
  i think she was great at eurovision although she did n't get so much points as we would have expected . 
  i did n't know anything about lacuna coil and cristina scabbia , i just discovered them , i think i 've never heard their name in all my life , that 's so surprising . 
  i forgot of sonohra , i just remembered of them right now . 
  i did n't think that italian artists were that known around europe , now i 'm wondering if it 's just me that ca n't stand it ahah, 
  it 's free and nowadays nobody use sms , if you are at home or have a wifi connection you can chat with everyone without paying . 
  also , i pay 10/12 euros a month , i do n't remember it exactly , and i have 200 free messages so it 's stupid to spend more money to be able to send more sms when i can send unlimited sms . 
  but of course , mainly about french . 
  there are tons of jokes about everything , from food to art to football to environment . 
  we joke about them saying that all the things they have are stolen from italy or are second to the italian ones . 
  i have to say though that italian jokes mainly `` offend '' italians themselves , in these jokes there are usually 3 people : 1 italian and 1 french and 1 german , or english , it depends . 
  usually the german and the french are the smart ones , while the italian is always the stupid . 
  but yeah , france , you 're our n. 1 enemy . 
  we all think europe is better than america, 
  at least the capitals , god . 
  i know mr probz , waves is one of my favourite songs , both the remix and the original . 
  back when i heard of veronica maggio i was surprised when i discovered she was swedish and that she sang in swedish, 
  personally there are few italian singers that i like ahah , talking about sound and originality i think we are behind the other music industries , in my opinion . 
  we have few new artists that reach success because radios give more space to well known artists like eros ramazzotti , laura pausini . . and rarely play songs by newcomers . 
  also record companies do n't spend time to find new talents and the only and easiest way to become popular is joining a talent show like x factor or the `` festival di sanremo '' . 
  few people become famous on their own . 
  that 's my opinion but i guess that 's also because i 've always loved foreign things rather than italians , i do n't hate my culture , i love it , but i have always found the others very very interesting . 
  no clue who lacuna coil are, 
  alright , since i live in sardinia one of the foods that i love is `` cordula '' that is made of intestines of lamb or goat intertwined together and cooked on a spit or in a pan with peas , it may sound gross but it tastes delicious . 
  another thing that i love are `` saltimbocca '' that are a typical dish from rome made of veal lined or topped with prosciutto and sage or basil .
