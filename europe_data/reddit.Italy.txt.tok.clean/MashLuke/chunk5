  the near cities are helping the people of amatrice providing food and clothes . 
  i have n't heard anything but i do n't think they will call for help , they are mobilising all the people that can do something helpful , at least not right now , they have 3 months to decide , who knows, 
  i posted news about the earthquake on r/worldnews and i got downvoted, 
  now the `` everybody can dress how they want '' it 's getting a little ridicolous, 
  that 's so bad ... 
  i have n't an opinion about him , i just wanted to spread the news, 
  ** update : ** 4 more people found dead , they are now 124, 
  that 's the opposite , if you are sleeping you ca n't immediately realize what 's happening , also , if it was day many people would not have been in their houses, 
  ** fast summary ** many kids got stucked in the fallen down buildings , some now are safe but some unfortunately were found dead under the ruins : * two kids were saved by their grandmom that as she heard the earthquake made them stay under her bed , saving them . 
  now she is stucked on their house but the rescuers are trying to free her . 
  * a couple have been found dead with their children , the parents were found dead hugged together , one kid was 8 years old , the other had 8 months * a little girl aged 18 months was found dead by his granddad , her parents were on vacation in the city of arquata del tronto . 
  her mother also survived the earthquake in l'aquila in 2009 * two little 6 years old twins got stucked under the ruins of their house , one of the two was saved by the volunteers but the other was found dead . 
  * two girls of age 12 and 14 years old are the only members of their family still alive after the distaster that took place in amatrice , their and grandparents died tonigh, 
  update : unofficial death tool rises to 63 http://www.ansa.it/english/news/general_news/2016/08/24/at-least-21-dead-in-6.0-earthquake_63a1ac6f-acc9-4639-a8d9-718bf6415bb9.html edit : ** 120 ** people found dead now, 
  this might sound as the coolest idea ever . 
  i honestly find it quite stupid because they are spending 290 millions only on people born in 1998 , what about the people born in the next years ? 
  do you think they will spend that amount of money each year ? 
  i would actually use them but i think it 's a waste because they could have spent them in other things more useful , maybe to rebuild old schools or for scholarships . 
  they always do this kind of stuff , one day it 's 80 $ to a few workers , one day it 's 500 $ to teachers and the list goes on but does this really help ? 
  it 's like finding a euro on the street , you are happy for the finding and you go spend it but after that ? 
  you had more money for a few days but your life has not changed , you are not richer or poorer . 
  newspapers say that the number can only grow , the most atrocious stories at the moment : * a kid who had a twin lose his life while his brother was saved * there was a couple stucked under their houses with their children , they were found dead , the youngest kid was barely 1 year old . 
  38 dead at the moment, 
  well there has been an improvement , the number of intolerant people was way bigger back in 1950 , it 's a fact , but i have to agree with you . 
  as a young person i know some young people that still like fascism , not kidding , it 's also illegal in italy but go tell them , and i have a lot of friends that are disgusted by homosexuals . 
  i usually do n't judge anyone but when i hear stuff like : `` they will probably have sex in public '' i feel shocked , come on , why the hell would someone have sex in public ? 
  ignorance is a huge beast . 
  i hope that as new generations go all these acts will end , i still wonder why the fuck would i care if someone likes men or likes girls because god said no . 
  you have never talked to god so fuck off . 
  sweden or the netherlands , because i love their environment and backgrounds and at least i would be way taller, 
  caralho means `` fuck '' , does n't it ? 
  italy at the olympics , we lost 4 semifinals out of 4 * beachvolley semifinal : ita vs bra ( silver ) * male water polo semifinal : ita vs ser ( x ) ; ita vs montenegro ( bronze ) * female water polo semifinal : ita vs usa ( silver ) * male volleyball : ita vs bra ( silver ) however , we are 9th in the final medal table !, 
  in italy it 's very popular because of the talents we had in the past , also both female and male teams got qualified for the semifinals and eventually won a medal !, 
  they also have their own surnames : male team is called `` sette bello '' that means `` the good seven '' while female team is called `` sette rosa '' that means `` pink seven '' . 
  it 's one of the few sports where we are almost sure to win a medal so it 's very followed . 
  i find it very entertaining , i always watch it during the olympics, 
  italy was doing well !, 
  unfortunately we lost against serbia that in the end won gold so that 's fine, 
  kawaii dude, 
  let 's create a new empire where europe is the number 1 !, 
  make europe ~ ~ great again ! ~ ~ great * er * than it has ever been !, 
  let 's beat muricans !, 
  god they must be subscribed on reddit . 
  that 's brazil, 
  yep you are right , russia , as far as i know , is still in europe, 
  uk , france , germany , italy and russia, 
  because they are way way poorer , they do n't invest in finding new talents that can be good at sports and few people can pay to practice a sport . 
  african countries are mainly good at running that does n't require huge amounts of money , also of you are talented you easily find a sponsor that will pay you shoes and other stuff . 
  about north korea is a completely different story , they will always find new talents to show the greatness of the country like ussr did back then , although they are way way smaller . 
  this made me giggle . 
  i remember this comedy video there was this mother who was preparing shool lunch to his son and after she finishes she says to his son : `` tell the muslim kids there 's ham so they wo n't steal your lunch ! '', 
  you certainly do n't expect people to be serious when they say something like this . 
  what would you except from us ? 
  we have vatican inside, 
  i actually like this series called `` polseres vermelles '' ( the original format ) that in italian is called `` braccialetti rossi . 
  i obviously watch the italian version but it 's based on a spanish book . 
  i have to say it 's a show that teens tend to like more than adults so i think it 's something completely different from what you might usually watch but it 's very well done, 
  it seems very good, 
  `` rex '' is huge here too , i used to watch it a lot, 
  still no clue if muslim women want to cover themselves because they want or not , anyway comparing nuns , that are obviously covered because they want so , to women wearing burkini does n't make sense . 
  imo the fact that it exist something called `` burkini '' is like creating a clothing line only for nuns , it 's just a way to speculate on religion ( at least that 's what i think ) . 
  anyway i do n't know if banning it is right or not because from a side everybody should wear what they want , from the other side , it created many controversies so who knows . . 
  yeeeeah , well done girl !, 
  only at burger king when he orders a whopper, 
  oh i consider myself european but i also love seeing my country winnning against our neighbors , that feeling is indescribable, 
  nah , i prefer having less medals than denying my nationality, 
  x-post from [ r/photoshopbattles ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/4y7huf/psbattle_swedish_king_and_queen_at_the_olympics/ ), 
  he used to write facebook posts and say bad things about southern people saying that they were lazy and the reason of the crisis in northern italy , used to say sardianians were sheepfuckers and he also wanted to make lombardy an independent state , he then deleted everything and now even some southern people think that he is a good person, 
  from chinese immigrants, 
  i would love to study there, 
  that 's a good idea !, 
  then we should create some buildings where these people can get a shower , like a metaphor to say that they are n't making our society dirty anymore , i think that would be a great idea !, 
  i guess you can say both , i usually use this [ website ] ( http://www.wordreference.com/iten/case%20popolari ) for words that i do n't know, 
  personally i 've always preferred adidas to armani . 
  obviously the last one is better if we are talking about high fashion but it 's too expensive . 
  i have to say anyway that adidas sweaters are becoming too overpriced , imo, 
  yep , that 's true, 
  damn , i have seen some of these but wow that icelandic church is gorgeous . 
  yeah , it 's not that all the people who live in these buildings are ignorant or bad but it 's also true that the majority is so used to not do anything at all that they eventually not do anything to improve their situation . 
  i have to say that i know people who live in these houses that are even embarrassed to live there and try to improve themselves for their families but seeing people wasting their time in this way is awful and disrespectful, 
  yeah they do n't do this to anyone , only to families that have a very hard situation . 
  basically the government gives a house to those people who ca n't afford one , paying them the running water and the electricity . 
  in italian those houses are called `` case popolari '', 
  these kids usually live in public housing so even if they parents work they do n't have to worry about taxes and other things . 
  anyway even if they have their own houses some parents do n't really care about their kids or they ca n't find a way to make them graduate . 
  also you ca n't imagine how many poeple get paid for illegal stuff or work under the table . 
  many people drop out of school because they usually directly go to work because their parents have their own enterprise . 
  also especially in sourthern italy , some kids do n't want to study anything , do n't want to work and have n't dreams . 
  these people usually spend their time smoking and going around without even having a job . 
  it might sound too pessimistic but i see too many teens that do n't go to school and just waste their time . 
  that 's awful and cringey , i ca n't watch this video . 
  to be honest italian researchers are doing a good job but the majority do n't work in italy and go to the us or in other european countries . 
  anyway for a country that has 60.000.000 people we are not that good but we are trying to improve ourselves . 
  that 's pretty genius , anyway i would have still forgotten it ahah , creative though, 
  not that bad i thought worse, 
  gosh how do you remember your username ? 
  i would have forgotten it since the first time, 
  how do you think he learned to run so fast ? 
  at least we do n't have declensions, 
  also romanian language is derivated from latin so rome 's influence is clear in every aspect,
