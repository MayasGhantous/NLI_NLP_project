  i guess it 's better than crocs, 
  for happiness you mean ? 
  yeah, 
  that wo n't happen because it will lose all the fun . 
  i love watching my country competing against our neighbours and then rejoicing when we win or crying if we lose . 
  that 's an extreme comparison , i just think that without all this stuff like the fact that you have to follow certain rules because someone said so , someone invisible and maybe imaginary , it 's bullshit . 
  you can be christian , muslim , who the hell you want to be but do it using your brain not following a book written years ago . 
  that 's what i think , i do n't want to censor religions , just do n't be an idiot in its name . 
  yeah , and that 's why the world would have been way better without religion, 
  i honestly do n't know , some just give the water and when you go to pay they do n't add it to the check , also , for example , i remember that the waiters in france where the first to ask you if you wanted tap water . 
  it depends but you 'll mostly pay it , even for 0,30 cent for just a glass of water . 
  it just depends on the place . 
  i remember going to french restaurants and they used to give me tap water because it was cheaper that i remember . 
  some places do give you free water because they gain more money with alcohol so they do n't let costumers pay water . 
  anyway , at least in italy for what i know , we do n't use tap water and the fact a place sells alcohol does n't mean they will give you free water . 
  is matteo renzi so well-viewed ? 
  breaking news : putin is fighting in ukraine to host the eurovision song contest in russia, 
  in fact , if you want to ban everyone do it , not just ban someone for 8 years while the others are still competiting . 
  nothing else . 
  the iron lady !, 
  you are doing great but i think you should seriously thank only katinka hosszu because the girl won 3 of your gold medals . 
  she is such a beast , you are so lucky to have such a talent but as a swimming fan it 's known that hungary has very talented swimmers so good luck guys !, 
  exaclty . 
  i 'm shocked and angry because there are russian and chinese athletes that are still competing after 2 bans . 
  to not talk about how much the judges in every sport are always helping these athletes , they must be paying a lot of money to not be completely fucked up at the olympics . 
  he has n't done anything worse than the others , his fault is just to be italian . 
  maybe , but using dope is your decision , nobody says you must do that . 
  it 's not only their government 's fault . 
  they were probably in a difficult position to not accept it but they were conscious anyway , i do n't want to say they have no faults . 
  the russian swimmer in the picture , yulia efimova , was banned not once but twice for doping and another russian swimmer , vladimir morozov , was also banned for doping . 
  they ca n't think that everybody will support them when you do something like this . 
  but russia is not the only , many chinese swimmers were found positive to doping tests . 
  it sucks and what russia did sucks . 
  i do n't read that much but this book was amazing . 
  i had to read it for school and it 's one of the few books i liked reading : [ `` the solitude of prime numbers '' by paolo giordano ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6613956-the-solitude-of-prime-numbers ) it was his first novel ever published and it became one of the best selling books in italy . 
  in 2008 it won the strega prize that is the most prestigious italian literary award and it was the best selling book in italy in that year . 
  no clue if it has been translated in finnish but it 's one of the best italian book of modern times , you have to read it . 
  english and french for sure , but also spanish and german for many reasons : * english : it 's official language for almost everything , if we are speaking english right now there must be a reason . 
  it lacks on bad words so it 's hard to say something nasty except saying `` fuck '' on repeat , pretty helpful if you want a cup of tea . 
  * french : it 's the official language for the eu and for other important organizations and events , like the eurovision song contest . 
  it 's spoken in many african countries and also in south america . 
  it 's the best language to ask a stranger to have sex with you . 
  * spanish : it 's the second most spoken language in the world , it 's spoken all over latin america and in spain , of course . 
  it 's a very funny language and at least when you ask a `` tequila '' you will sound amazingly romantic . 
  \u00a1 ol\u00c9 !, 
  * german : it 's very helpful if you want to work there , one of the most interesting languages in the world and the only language that will make you sound extremely angry even when you ask : `` where is the toilet ? '', 
  russia has won 9 gold medals in fencing ( 29 totals with urss included ) but way less gold medals than the other countries : italy : 48 gold medals france : 41 gold medals hungary : 35 gold medals, 
  ** pay attention ** * if your country is grey it means you have n't won any gold medal , sorry * this map shows the gold medals won by each country after their independence , so countries like czechoslovakia and jugoslavia are not considered, 
  it 's not summer until you see a sunburnt swedish, 
  i can confirm it 's not only germans , i 've seen english , french , and even scandinavian tourists doing the same thing . 
  you easily recognize tourists because you do n't see so many blonde and pale-skinned people in italy , and they are usually sunburnt , very badly . 
  men 's judo, 
  you invaders wo n't conquer our beaches , you little beaches !, 
  omg that 's the funniest thing i 've read today ahahah , thank you scandinavia, 
  shhh do n't ruin everything, 
  yeaah southern italy and greece for the win !, 
  high five greece !, 
  i hope they did, 
  she even won the competition that year . 
  technically , according to the lateran pacts of 1929 made between italy and the holy see they must help our government in every competition or we will have the right to take their territories back to us sooo ... 
  shit , i wish i could change the title , i tried my best to not make grammatical errors before posting it . 
  i even searched the word before writing it , aaaah that 's frustrating . 
  what would you expect someone to do with a username like that ? 
  yeah , a good rap song will make young people vote for them , something like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kppx4bzfaae ) will be very appreciated by the music critics !, 
  perfect , it has that irish/british cheesiness that will help the vatican to win !, 
  almost , what about [ alicia keys ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpaqysd75ak ) ? 
  what about this [ girl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpaqysd75ak ) ? 
  `` and now we are going to vatican city , good evening pope francis '' * weird visual effects * '' < god  evening europe , thanks for letting us join this incredible competition , and now here 's the vatican votes . . '', 
  yeah but can you imagine the vatican jury to judge acts like verka serduchka ? 
  anyway maybe they will give 12 points to italy which is not a bad thing but the pope will start to excommunicate every leader that wo n't give 12 points to them . 
  can i say i would have never known anything about this if it was n't for the bbc and reddit ? 
  no kidding , i did n't read anything on italian blogs . 
  that 's surprising , who would have thought that ... ? 
  it 's the best place to go when you are thirsty and your partner is thirsty but in a different way, 
  honestly i answered the survey and i voted what the majority voted , for many reasons . 
  it 's not a secret that we have problems with our educational system and with corruption and it 's not a secret that there are a lot of young people who ca n't get job . 
  we have some serious problems , look at the section `` graduate or bust '' , we are the only country who completely thinks that the government does n't prepare kids for the job market . 
  maybe us young people are a bit pessimist but we have a lot things to improve . 
  i think the most interesting thing is the difference between north countries , like sweden and norway , and south countries , like italy and spain . 
  scandinavian people seem to be more `` skeptical '' about immigrants while we tend to be more open . 
  not gon na lie , this idea scares me . 
  it 's not that i do n't care about my country but i think it 's not right fighting for something that i did n't want . 
  anyway , the question is pretty generic so it did n't specify if you would be willing to fight against an invader or just in the name of your country . 
  i think this , i would never fight for my country if italy were bound by some kind of alliance and we would be forced to fight in a war that we have n't any interest in joining and i would n't want to fight against an invader , but i would , because i would be forced to do so . 
  i add that for example in italy many young people every year voluntarily join the army so it is composed only by volunteers , we do n't have to join it if we do n't want because it 's not necessary . 
  i honestly say that i kinda agree with the answers given by the people of my country because , that i know , nobody , unless they do for work , wants to randomly kill someone or fight for a government that the majority of the people hates, 
  do you see that orange spot on the italian map ? 
  that 's us . . 
  which question are you talking about ? 
  there are 2 teories : they lie or they have n't hands . 
  hey mate , you are still young, 
  i honestly think this is becoming a news just because nobody would spend 10 days in an airport to the point of being exhausted, 
  that surprised me a lot, 
  ** pay attention ** this is a survey held by ebu and 14 european broadcasters . 
  the results are divided by category according to the topic of the questions , you can change the topic by clicking on one of the phrases above the map . 
  the questions are about many arguments : from work to civil rights but also from sex life to immigration, 
  they are right , it must be covered !, 
  look at us italians , we are all traumatized since our birth because of this kind of sculptures !, 
  when i was a kid i had nightmares when i went to florence !, 
  rapers , thiefs and killers do this kind of actions because they have seen a sculpture of a giant nude man .
