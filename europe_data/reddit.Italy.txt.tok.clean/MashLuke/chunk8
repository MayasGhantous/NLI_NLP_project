  after several posts we created a [ sub ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyamericanrecipes/ ) dedicated to these crimes . 
   how does one do that ? 
  asking for a friend  dutch flair makes sense . 
   malta --  grazzi that 's basically what english speakers say when they pronounce * grazie *, 
  agree , the dutch video is not really criticizing trump but is mocking everything that happened . 
  the others were more direct to him rather than to his campaign . 
  it 's not worth it ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ waiting ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ right ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ moment, 
  i 'm actually really glad he was an idiot but yeah objectively it 's a not very smart idea . 
  wait , is it not a common thing ? 
  my grandpa only eats apples after skinning them and i know a lot of people that do it . 
  personally , i have never learned how to do it so i just wash them and eat them with skin . 
  for its musuems . 
  prague . 
  for its architecture . 
  i wish that was a real competition . 
  the way they make butter is really sexy . 
  beetles of europe : [ european rhinoceros beetle ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/dynastinae_-_oryctes_nasicornis-002.jpg/800px-dynastinae_-_oryctes_nasicornis-002.jpg ) anyway , can anyone create a subreddit dedicated only and exclusively to memes and various shitposts ? 
  like euromemes or something ? 
  it would be a good way to reduce poor effort pics here and give a lot of users another way to waste their time . 
  damn i missed the `` tits of europe '' moment ahah, 
  just searched , you are right . 
  she was/is sort of popular here , for this [ song ] ( https://youtu.be/m3m6qmyieje ) mostly and also for [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/yz2658gzoum ) . 
  i 'm almost sure pewdiepie does but he often moves to l.a. 
  that 's weird but probably not as much as the people that are shown to actually like his tweets . 
  those blue dots in belgium are smurfs i suppose . 
  both wearing adidas track suits . 
  people that say masturbation is bad are idiots . 
  boys have natural expulsions of sperm in the night , in those called `` wet dreams '' , and masturbation helps to avoid social problems and embarassment . 
  if i 'm right , people were initially against it because they thought testicles did n't produce semen constantly so you could have wasted the precious life-bringing gift that god gave you . 
  which is a stupid idea right now . 
  i really like the colours of the lithuanian flag . 
  i 'm in sardinia and i have n't seen it since 2012, 
  sorry they are off market . 
  sure , give me your winter and i 'll give you mine . 
  i will keep my summer though . 
  it 's apparently snowing everywhere , except here . 
   ` if you talk while having sex , your child will be a stutterer ' they ca n't be serious , this is hilariously wrong . 
  oh , that would n't be a pizza . 
  that would be a toxic mess of tomato sauce . 
  thanks for posting , i missed this . 
  we are happy if you do !, 
  sardinia is full of sites but noone really tries to protect all of them , it 's really sad . 
  at the moment i prefer the 11 \u00b0 c degrees outside my house . 
  norway and switzerland are like the cool rich boys in high school that act so just to hide their small penises . 
  i guess they want the english to be unaware . 
  i have personally never heard or studied anything related to any invasion of poland . 
  i have searched on google and the only battles fought by italians in poland happened when an italian unit of volunteers , `` the garibaldi legion '' , fought for polish independence in 1863 :  the unit was named after the italian revolutionary and nationalist giuseppe garibaldi , organized in italy by his son menotti garibaldi and led by the general francesco nullo . 
  nullo arrived in krak\u00f3w from italy in april 1863 . 
  the unit 's first battle in poland was at pod\u0142\u0119\u017ce on may 3 , 1863 where it defeated a russian force . 
  subsequently , it took part in the battle of krzykawka , where along with the french organized zouaves of death it suffered heavy casualties ; nullo was killed and his adjutant mortally wounded and died several days later . 
  francesco nullo is considered an independence hero in both italy and poland . 
  and some polish volunteers even took part in the liberation of italy :  the mickiewicz 's legion was a military unit formed in 1848 in rome by one of the most notable polish poets , adam mickiewicz , to take part in the liberation of italy after the failure of the greater poland uprising of 1848 . 
  after unsuccessfully pleading pope pius ix for support , mickiewicz was joined in milan by a military detachment of polish emigrants , led by mikolaj kaminski . 
  growing to 120 members by june , the legion , commanded by kaminski , engaged in several battles . 
  they fought alongside others in lombardy and on barricades of genoa against the royalists , in the defence of the roman republic . 
  france ( aka bruni empire ) according to italy : * dirty hairy hipsters *, 
  only 489 swedes have taken the survey , it 's not really that much compared to the other countries . 
  for real , what is this due to ? 
  it 's kinda sad for a small island . 
  nostalgic italian spirit will finally rise again . 
  erasmus is like the european tinder . 
  is it ? 
  i know that about french women . 
  god some comments on youtube are so dumb . 
  it 's odd seeing people referring to this action as a `` tradition '' . 
  they lie , i know nobody that does n't use internet , even just for facebook . 
  it 's pretty weird tbh . 
  in general religion is not as strong as it was , especially between young people , but a few people sometimes can make more noise than thousands . 
   if the brain of a transgender person is different , why would we prioritize genitals over brain function ? 
  it 's not that , but the use of bathroom is based on your genitals because females and males have different necessities , women have peroids while men have not , men can use urinals while women ca n't . 
  i have been thinking about this and if someone can really be perceived as a male/female they probably need to use the men 's / women 's restrooms , it would be more reasonable . 
  anyway , when you look like a man and you enter in the women 's restroom is inevitable that you are going to get a reaction , i understand the problem but transexuals consist of a small percentage of population , if we accept men in women 's bathrooms and viceversa someone might easily take advantage of this for their own interests . 
  being in a society means partly renouncing to your personal freedom for the common good and when you do something like this you might go against other people 's freedom and safety . 
  i think it depends . 
  the cases you quoted refer to people that are born males/females but also partly developed physical parts of the opposite sex , transexual people are born males/females but refuse their natural body and identify themselves in the opposite one . 
  about the first , they probably should personally decide to which one of 2 they identify the most , otherwise , for me as long as you have a penis or a vagina you should use the bathroom based on that . 
  i might go against the tide , but identifying yourself as a female/male does n't automatically make you one . 
  if you feel that way your personal life is none of my business but if you are a male physically , you have to use the men 's bathroom . 
  i was wondering the same thing , at least for italy . 
  the average hair colour is darker , from what i see . 
  may be the reason the fact you are leaving ? 
  like , you might be an example of an independent country that has decided to finally quit what for a lot of people it 's an evil association . 
  it 's definitely not surprising , just a bit disarming . 
  the eu in general is not well-viewed , its major members are not as well and russophiles are growing . 
  next year , as the uk will definitively leave the union , italy 's role is going to be more important and without the trust in the other members , it 's going to be interesting . 
  so basically italy hates all the major countries in the eu and prefers the others outside of it . 
   hungary , like i 'm hungry i think this sentence made everything more awkward . 
  yes , correct . 
  but we have the sun , the sea , and you always come to the south on summer / s, 
  am i weird if i say it 's gorgeous ? 
  r/italy the best !, 
  these episodes are becoming clich\u00e9s and it 's so frightening . 
   `` 60s housing bubble collusion in southern italy '' . 
  this hurts ahah but i definitely ca n't disagree with this . 
  anyway , i 'm in sardinia, 
  lol , is the problem the copy and paste from imgur or the part `` goliards free the students '' that kinda make seem school a sort of prison for young people ? 
  if it is the last , this act is called so , `` liberation of students '' , because goliards `` free '' students from their ordinary lives and make them have a little fun before christmas vacations . 
  maybe i should have put that word between inverted commas . 
  i honestly do n't get your comment . 
  first of all , this happens only for 3 days in december , so the other days everybody works/study normally , second thing , this happens in the morning and it 's done by students mostly , so they can easily work in the afternoon if they have to .
