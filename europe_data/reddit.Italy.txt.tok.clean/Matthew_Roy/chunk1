i wanted to get an idea about how many rapes are committed by locals or foreigners in italy , the last data i could find about it are from 2009 ( this article : http://www.repubblica.it/2009/02/sezioni/cronaca/violenza-sessuale-3/stupri-viminale/stupri-viminale.html ) it says : 60.9 % of the rapes are made by italians . 
  the adult italian males are 26 millions , the foreigners were roughly 2 millions ( http://www.comuni-italiani.it/statistiche/stranieri.html ) so the one tenth of the male adults population made by foreigners is responsible for almost 40 % of the total rapes . 
  thank you , 
  does anyone have a link with the expected outcome ? 
  i knew they predicted the green party to win , i just want to see by how much they were wrong . 
  please help me understand this , if the `` no '' wins do we keep the new electoral law ( italicum ) or not ? 
  i still have to decide as there are both positive and negative changes in there , but i would never vote no if it means going back to porcellum, 
  they do n't pay taxes . 
  what they gain from their businesses they send it to their homeland . 
  here is a link in [ italian ] ( http://www.lastampa.it/2015/09/21/economia/quel-mare-di-soldi-finito-in-cina-che-il-fisco-italiano-non-vedr-pi-mk2hjdw5fddjmzfmjkncul/pagina.html ) , it says between the examples that there was one guy who declared to have gained less than 18k to the state and then sent more than 1 million to china . 
  also when you say their employees . . they are not under contract . 
  and 99,9 % of the people that work for them are from their ethnicity , so no jobs for the italians, 
  [ probably ] ( http://www.thefreedictionary.com/probably ), 
  our politicians will spend one minute on their social accounts pointing out how they are shocked and sad for the loss of so many human lives , highlighting once again the need to do something . 
  then they will proceed to avoid the issue entirely until the next tragedy . 
  and that 's just your assumption, 
  i do n't agree with all your reasoning , but i respect you for voting no instead of not going to vote at all . 
  to let the foreigners understand the situation , some of the political figures in italy ( including pm renzi and former president napolitano ) in the last few days have incouraged abstention or considered `` not voting '' a legitimate choice . 
  i understand that the government , who passed these laws in the first place , is trying to defend what they did . 
  but they should do it properly , not asking people to renounce one of the few democratic rights that we have . 
  we will be ready , if by ready you mean ready to rescue an even bigger number of migrants and let them use our coast guard as a taxi, 
  my favourite is [ san marino 's flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/flag_of_san_marino.svg/2000px-flag_of_san_marino.svg.png ) then i really like our islands regional flags , [ sicily ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/sicilian_flag.svg/800px-sicilian_flag.svg.png ) and [ sardinia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/flag_of_the_italian_region_sardinia.svg/895px-flag_of_the_italian_region_sardinia.svg.png ) & nbsp ; outside of italy i like [ spain ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/flag_of_spain.svg/750px-flag_of_spain.svg.png ) and [ estonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/flag_of_estonia.svg/990px-flag_of_estonia.svg.png ) the most, 
  personally i think the flow could start shifting from greece to albania and then back across the sea through the adriatic . 
  you can see how close we are from [ this image ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/adriatic_sea_map.png ) . 
  this used to be a smuggling route for cigarettes and such , so there could be the involvement again of local mafia with speedboats ( transferring humans instead of goods this time ) . 
  i have read an article already saying the costal guard is getting ready in apulia ( ready to rescue people is my guess ) and some priest is already preaching for hospitality . .

  poor girl . . 
  i ca n't imagine how bad her last moments must have been, 
   its super easy to leave it 's not easy at all if you are a woman in a radical muslim family, 
   an 11-year-old home-educated girl ofc they are n't even sending them to school , probably wo n't ever learn the language of the country they live in . 
  and then people wonder why second or third generation immigrants are n't integrated , of course it happens if we let their parents pretty much segregate them from the rest of society . 
  in connection with damage of property or theft , yes . 
  you underestimate the huge influence that cardinals , bishops and priests have in our society . 
  the church entourage is always vocal when politicians try to touch these kind of subjects and there is still millions of people in the older generations that are willing to listen to them, 
  where i 'm from we eat [ chiacchere ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/chiacchiere ), 
  he should resign after saying something so stupid . 
  you should be held accountable for giving these kind of messages, 
  my biggest issue with this video is : why would he use his `` motor '' on a downhill section ? 
  plus it 's not unreasonable that the back wheel was still spinning after falling like that . 
  you wheels do n't magically stop spinning unless you crash in a bad way, 
  for italy it 's probably one between austria , the ottomans and ... ethiopia .

  i have only been in the big cities ( bruxelles , bruges ) when i was 13-14 i could n't believe the amount of people riding a bicycle in a safe environment ( compared to where i lived at least ) . 
  i still remember being amazed seeing all those bicycle lanes everywhere i guess it 's a whole different story when you leave the cities . 
  but hey at least i would get to watch the cobbled classics live , no complaints, 
  belgium it 'd be a great country for someone like me who loves cycling, 
  personally my biggest issue with immigration is economical . 
  we just ca n't afford it ( to take migrants in ) . 
  here is the scenario in italy : - 12 % unemployment rate ( only now has started to slowly decrease ) - 40 % unemployment for population between 15-24 yo - millions of our countrymen that have migrated in the last 5-10 years . 
  i know a lot of stories of young guys of the same age as me ( mid 20 ) that are now in uk , switzerland or australia . 
  i have read that london is the 13th country in the world for italian citizens population ( 250k , close to the inhabitants of venice to make you understand ) - an historical huge economic gap between north part of the country and the south . 
  which leads to millions of people migrating from south to north looking for job and better educaiton we have enough migrants of our own , if we do n't close the gates for people coming in we will inevitably have even more people going out of the country , wether because there will be no jobs for everyone or because the salaries will end up going down making it impossible to sustain the level of life we have been used to . 
  the only solution would be help from eu in making a plan to prevent ships from sailing to us in the first place , once they are in the middle of the sea we pretty much have to rescue them and bring them in . 
  it 's also in the interest of france , germany and such as the majority of migrants that comes here ends up moving north anyway . 
  it 's not an easy task at all that 's why only the resources from eu could at least decrease the influx of migrants . 
  our government does n't seem to care about it , perhaps because there a lot of people abusing the system to make a lot of money off migrant housing and such . 
  and the only party who has agenda about the immigration problem is full of xenophobic morons ( lega nord ) which does n't help at all establishing a positive exchange on the issue . 
  i 've been corrected already , no reason to act as a smartass still does n't change the fact that he was n't running for pm in the last elections , same thing you could say about the two pms before him, 
  technically yes , still we are asked to choose the party or coalition whose leader should end up being the pm . 
  his party won the elections , there was a government crisis and we found ourselves with this clown who was n't even running for pm, 
  i did n't vote for this guy . 
  in fact nobody in our country did, 
  also getting tired of seeing the berlin wall analogy thrown out there just to gain favour against the hungarian fences . 
  they do n't belong with each other, 
  exactly . 
  millions of people are forced to leave their eastern european countries in the first place , what makes you think that they have place for other countries migrants ? 
  he learned from this guy : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvy1pniyc4a, 
  nothing beats our prime minister : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0kjzeh2jn8, 
  which one between this and the haiducii version is the original ? 
  in the last decades we always kept good relations with russia , mainly because we need their gas . 
  other than that the usa . 
  we let them have hundreds of military bases in our territory , you 'd think they would help us out, 
  look , it 's not like i 'm saying that cultural values do n't play their role in this . 
  they surely do , but for me the main reason why most of my generation ca n't move out is simple : most of us ca n't afford it . 
  sure you can look at the higher average wages and say we have it better here but keep in mind that : - you have way lower cost of living - we have 40 % of unemployment for young people , you have what ? 
  - our average incomes datas are skewed anyway , young people are paid like shit in this country ( compared to the other western countries at least ) having said that i do n't think it 's hard to understand that the biggest impediment for leaving the family house is n't just our traditions but the fact the youngsters here ca n't pay for it not even at 25-29, 
  how about all those non existing pages of people like me who never applied because i already knew that i did n't meet the requirements of low income in the first place ? 
  you ca n't just take some documents that say 161 in and 51 out and say it 's good and forget about the hundreds of pages of people from middle class families who are still struggling to pay for education but are n't there because they do n't qualify for any kind of social help . 
  maybe in bari it 's different , when i studied we had the same requirement for everything ( housing , cafeteria , scolarships ) . 
  all i could get with my financial situation was a 50 $ discount on a 400 $ for a shared room which was too expensive for me anyway, 
   i expect that in places like italy the number of sons living with their mothers would outweigh the number of daughters for example . 
  what makes you have this expectation ? 
  other than the stereotype of italian men being `` mamma 's boys '' actually you could argue that men have more chances of leaving the house early , considering we are generally less unemployed than women, 
  it 's easy to go outside early when your country pays for your studies and sometimes pays for your accomodation while you study outside too . 
  then all you have left to pay is food + going out activities , that 's not hard to cover ( plus you can still have your parents cover for that while being `` out of the house '' ) here in italy there is zero support to students . 
  you have to be dirty poor to get exemptions from paying taxes . 
  when i did n't have a source of income i would pay 1000 a year for a pubblic university , my parents have 4 kids and low paying jobs so in no way we could be considered rich . 
  we never got anywhere close to receive any kind of help , i would n't even qualify for the discounts for the campus cafeteria ... and again officially i moved out of the house at 24 , but without the help of parents , extended family ( and working my ass off too ) , there is no way i could have made it this quick . 
  it 's tough to say . 
  few months ago we had a referendum that did n't reach the quorum ( was n't even close ) and everyone tought it was a huge victory for pd and renzi in particular as he was one of those who encouraged abstention . 
  now pd lost this round of elections badly . 
  as you say local politics was a big factor ( in rome in particular ) , but nobody expected them to lose turin and struggle in bologna like they did . 
  so is renzi losing favour ? 
  an answer should come in october , there is another referendum with no quorum about the changes to the constitution made by renzi 's government . 
  if he loses it will mean that the majority rejected one of the reforms that he was appointed for in the first place . 
  how about [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9suaegs-0q ) ? 
  well it 's more like going from 15c to 5c . . but you have a point, 
   beatrice lorenzin said the monthly bonus for lower income families should be twice the current $ 80 just want to highlight the amount of money we are talking about . 
  from 80 $ to 160 $ so guess what ?
