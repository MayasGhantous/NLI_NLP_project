   any crime commited is one crime to many . 
  also it is extremely draconic to punish 1 million people for the crimes that 1000 commited . 
  i never said punish them all nor did i ever say to kick them all out , i l saying we should ask for proper checks on alleged refugees and that we should stop allowing economic migrants to get in ** illegally ** . 
  they are still welcome to come legally and i still think we should get refugees but there must be more control , enough of this nonsensical `` all welcome '' approach based on emotion . 
   also next time , dont vote for fascists . 
  maybe you wont lose people like fermi or yves montand . 
  nice comeback buddy , so are you implying that i 'm a hundred years old fascist or you are blaming all italians for italy 's past problems ? 
  do you also blame syrian refugees and all other immigrants for their troubles ? 
  i thought you accused me of generalising . 
   we do n't really care what problems italy is going through with its brain drain . 
  pay your smart people more . 
  ah so you do not even care about the problems that immigration causes in the countries that migrants are leaving in droves , nice of you . 
   not to mention that in the case of coluche and platini , their parents werent really qualified people . 
  they were random joes . 
  we took a risk and their kids paid off . 
  remind me again , did italians threaten to come in the millions over a short period of time ? 
  did they weigh heavily on the welfare system ? 
  did they come from a culture incompatible with that of the french ? 
  because last time i checked we have been neighbours for a long time and we had been interacting for centuries but hey , immigration between european nations is surely comparable to that between the third world and europe . 
   claiming that immigration is only a negative thing is bs and where did i say so ? 
  i stated clearly that accepting qualified , educated migrants and refugees in reasonable numbers is fine . 
  i am criticising the current situation in europe . 
   we had large amounts of unchecked italian immigration and we survived . 
  we even got some awesome people like coluche , yves montand , platini etc. 
  we also got some criminality : italian mafia , platini , but oh well ... and that was bad for italy as we lost lots of men power and suffered heavily from brain drain ( we still do ) . 
  yep its ** relative ** poverty not ** absolute ** poverty . 
  oh i agree with you , the problem is that moderates on each side are not nearly as loud as the extremists and are therefore overlooked . 
  as if sexual assault was the only problem with migrants , as if they were not a useless weight on our economy who fail to integrate and contribute to society and as if we were under any moral obligation to get loads of ** economic migrants ** . 
  unlimited immigration of young , uneducated men from extremely conservative and religious countries is nonsense . 
  we do not need them and do not benefit from them . 
  limited immigration of qualified individuals who can contribute to the economy is acceptable along with controlled intake of actual refugees . 
  unchecked immigration such as this is a suicide . 
  a thousand immigrants committing crimes is a thousand too many , the well-being and safety of europeans should be prioritised over that of foreigners . 
  these crimes would not have happened were it not for the senseless policies of merkel , not even a single crime committed by migrants is acceptable a thousand even less . 
  they are guests , either they behave or they go , we are under no moral obligation to be nice to them in face of appalling behaviour . 
   1 million rest who did n't do anything wrong . 
  last time i checked they came into the eu illegally , that into itself is absurd , and do n't give me any of that `` its the only way ! '', 
  or `` they do not have any alternative , they flee from war ! '', 
  it 's false , they are pretty safe in turkey and lebanon and they are not even all syrians , plenty of north africans are coming in as well , in fact syrians are a minority of the immigrants that have come since the beginning of the crisis in 2011 . http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11891219/refugee-crisis-many-migrants-falsely-claim-to-be-syrians-germany-says-as-eu-tries-to-ease-tensions.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10865652/illegal-immigration-to-europe-shows-sharp-rise.html http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/b/b7/five_main_citizenships_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants%2c_2014_%28number%2c_rounded_figures%29_yb15_iii.png they are exploiting the situation to get the most benefits and to settle where they can gain the most , those who are actually deserving of coming can get in legally and there are ways to get refugees without having to wait for them to come in droves such as picking them from refugee camps . 
  they come via boat because that way they can bypass the whole system and have a greater chance at getting in , it is quite hard to sympathise with such opportunistic behaviour . 
  way to go pegida , make all of us who want sensible migrant policies look like rambling fools . 
  please do not stop here , start praising hitler and parading with swastikas since you are at it . 
  i swear these guys are utter morons , after the events of cologne you would think they would use a bit of cunning and present themselves as the voice of reason , keep their cool and say `` see ? 
  what did we tell you ? '', 
  but instead of trying to capitalise on recent events to spread reason they go full retard . 
  this way they present themselves as no better than hooligans and do a disservice to all those who want restrictions on migration and sensible policing . 
  because anarchists and communists do n't ? 
  nah , only the ones that fail . 
  give me a break , this guy has been arguing for uncontrolled immigration on the basis of compassion and love regardless of religion . 
  still , he should not meddle in political affairs but most certainly he has not been `` railing up hatred '' . 
  he has been arguing in favour of immigration a lot in the past couple of years . 
  it 's not as much of a problem with press freedom as a problem with press politicization . 
  surely german news outlets keeping down news of refugee / economic migrants committing crimes in neither normal nor acceptable . 
  come on now , it was the ussr that made the call , not the poles . 
  go look at the amount of crimes recently committed by immigrants and those committed by the extreme right ( which by the way they are lumping together with the moderate right ) , see who did more damage to society . 
  last time i checked the migrants were winning by a landslide . 
  ah so it is fine to generalise the whole right wing / anti immigration part of the population as dangerous nazis but when thousands of immigrants commit crimes we should not be so quick to judge ? 
  double standards much ? 
   but right wingers did vandalise a home of ethiopeans in the netherlands . 
  and chanted that `` she needs a dick in her '' when someone spoke out in favour of a refugee asylum in a village . 
  a few extremists not representative of the majority of right-wingers , that is what they are . 
  or you know , you could stop them from coming illegally , deport them if they evade your border control and so on . 
  when did defending one borders become impossible ? 
  are we to let masses of uncivilised individuals just walk all over us ? 
  we set the terms , if they like it and are willing to follow our rules and our culture they are welcome , if not they can go back to whatever backward sandpit they came from . 
  any idea why ? 
  maybe because the vast majority of the population is christian and has been for centuries ? 
  reverse integration . 
  * cough * democracy * cough * european politicians are doing anything necessary to look good and moral instead of doing unpopular things that defend national interest because they fear they might loose their seats in parliament . 
  shoot repeatedly into the crowd ? 
   glad there 's something to laugh at in here too . 
  you find this funny ? 
  i find it infuriating , they know full well we will treat them better than they deserve based on alleged syrian citizenship and they are laughing at us . 
  because branding everyone who is not on board with absurd immigration policy is a legitimate argument worth discussing , k. 
  care to elaborate ? 
  you should visit rome , i was there a few days ago , there are armed soldiers at every tube station and major public place . 
  honestly i like it , at least there is a response from the government and if something happens there is an immediate response ( plus it deters common crimes as well ) . 
  tell this to those who died for our independence . 
  stereotyping would fit better . 
  come back when you are not england 's bitch . 
  yep , we already have our own crazy groups , one more reason not to import more especially when islamic terrorism has killed more people in the last twenty years than all the groups you have listed combined . 
  it 's not going to happen , sure , not because it is impossible but because there is no political will behind military intervention at the moment . 
  if the italian government was actually intentioned to intervene and protect its interests merkel 's opinion would not matter much . 
  it 's not exactly undemocratic , tactical voting is legal , it 's the fact that were it not for the success of the fn people would have voted centre left instead of centre right , the vote to the ump was based on the desire to deny victory to the fn rather than the genuine belief in the policies of the ump . 
  not saying they should not have done that , i am simply stating that the point of casting your vote is getting who you think is best in charge , not to prevent whom others think should be in charge from winning . 
  had they voted according to their political leanings the fn would have won , they chose to vote for a party with different policies and a different ideology just to prevent the vote of others from giving them the legislators they wanted . 
  they are free to do so but is not exactly the point of voting . 
   the french public voted for who they ~ ~ wanted ~ ~ hated less ftfy , instead of voting for their party of choice leftwingers voted for the centre right just to prevent the fn from winning . 
  this is hardly in the spirit of democracy . 
   you think italy can run a land war in libya , a country far more powerful than iraq and afghanistan ? 
  you mean a `` country '' currently fractured amongst two `` governments '' and various tribal and terrorist groups involved in a civil war ? 
  italy would n't even have to fight a conventional war , there is no united libya to fight , besides , we are in good relations with one of the governments , it would mostly be a matter of counter insurgency . 
   us british and french could n't even triple gaddafi without american support last time i checked uk and france merely bombed and armed the rebels who actually did the fighting on the ground and captured gheddafi . 
   italy would get chewed up and spat out with thousands of dead young italian men in less than 2 weeks . 
  thank god we have the insightful opinion of an expert such as yourself . 
  care to elaborate on how few divided , ill equipped and ill trained groups of terrorists are going to `` chew up and spit out '' a modern professional army in two weeks ? 
   lots of butt hurt patriotic italians here i only see a butthurt brit here . 
  yes ? 
  intervention itself is not the problem , military action is a political tool , if you use it incorrectly you are at fault , not the tool . 
  iraq and afghanistan could have been successes had they been managed properly .
