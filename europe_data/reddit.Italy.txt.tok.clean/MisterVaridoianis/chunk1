a russian would have the guts to nail it like luther did ... 
  apparently , russians prefer to [ nail their scrotum to the ground ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/11/artist-nails-testicles-red-square-pyotr-pavlensky?0p19g=c ) . 
  then wait till you learn about spain or , even worse , western china ... 
  it would n't be helpful . 
  we are generally not keen on foreign attempts at making any kind of pizza-like food ... 
   when half the world already speaks your language , you are n't terribly inclined or motivated to learn another one . 
  yeah , but when the * half of the world * you are referring to is [ on the other side ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_language#/media/file:study_of_spanish.svg ) , it does n't sound like a great excuse ... 
  * cechia * is not totally unheard of though . 
  definitely more widespread than czechia is in english . 
  yeah , here in italy we 've had some quite serious voting shifts of our own over the last 25 years , so i get what you mean . 
  but then again , we 're italians , so it 's no surprise . 
  instead , i 'm rather fascinated that even a small nordic country , with a population of 300,000 mostly well-educated people , can still face this level of political turmoil . 
  so your highest in 20 years is still lower than our lowest ( 5.7 % , april 2007 ) . 
  any explanation as to why the pirates lost so much ground in the opinion polls after peaking at 40 % last year ? 
  that 's true , but checco zalone 's movies are basically all the same too , so ... edit : grammar, 
  no doubt about that . 
  just be careful not to do the opposite and think that we can easily cope with more religious fucktards , just because we already have `` our own '' . 
  that 's true , but since religions are just glorified ideologies you can still tell which ones are worse than the others . 
  i mean , all religions equally bad in privileging faith and revealed truth over reason and rational argument , but they 're not equally harmful in what they specifically preach . 
  and i 'm sorry to say , islam is currently the worst of all in that department . 
  this only shows we need to get rid of christianity as well , not that we should tolerate even more religious bullshit . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  it 's the repeat of a run-off that van der bellen had won ( though just barely ) . 
  since then , polls have generally shown hofer to be leading , but never by more than 4 percentage points ( i.e. 
  yeah , but even if we still do n't know how consciousness really works , we do know it 's a product of our brain . 
  to the point that physical damages to each specific part of the brain lead to the loss of a specific mental faculty . 
  finnic paganism ( suomenusko ) is actually pretty cool in that department , as far as i know . 
  to be fair , it 's actually a `` rest of europe '' team . 
  the strongest countries ( czech republic , finland , russia , and sweden ) have a team of their own in the tournament . 
  also , from the next ( 2020 ) edition on , team europe and team north america u-23 will be dropped in favour of two more national teams selected via qualification rounds . 
  on a positive note , though , they 're planning a spin-off event beginning in 2018 , which would see a european all-star team face a north american all-star team in a five or seven-game series . 
   it 's not just some really weird coincidence that the country that has most embraced euthanasia is also coincidentally the country with this massive problem of doctors deliberately killing people without consent , and a lack of criminal enforcement . 
  it 's also the same country that [ once stayed 589 days without an elected government ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010\u201311_belgian_government_formation ) , and the same that [ took 4 months to catch the most wanted fugitive in europe , despite him never leaving their capital ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salah_abdeslam ) . 
  they do seem to have some problems with law enforcement . 
   both of these stem directly from the the moral restructuring that occurs when you entrust doctors with deciding whether or not it 's acceptable for someone to deliberately die . 
  well , we might have found the issue . 
  you apparently seem to think there 's some sort of absolute morality we should all adhere to . 
  on the contrary , i think morality is a collective agreement on what we currently consider right to do or not . 
  moral restructuring , through constant debate , based on rational arguments and factual evidence , is exactly what human society has been doing througout its entire history . 
   what makes belgium special is the degree to which doctors and nurses are empowered with the authority to make a judgement of who should live and who should die . 
  actually , it 's a judgement about who has valid reasons to be allowed to die right away upon request . 
  it 's a lot different . 
   but that 's not what 's happening . 
  1 in 60 administered life ending drugs with consent . 
  zero prosecutions . 
  the law is meaningless , this has defaulted to a matter of ethics . 
  if the belgian authorities are unable to properly deal with such violations , then i 'd say it 's a matter of poor law enforcement , rather than ethics . 
  of course , we can agree that having a lot of physicians , who either do n't understand the law or carelessly push its boundaries , is a matter of bad work ethic as well , but that 's almost tautological . 
   once you 've created a system where doctors have the power to authorize death , there is almost no moral imperative to consider the consent of the patient . 
  why would it be so ? 
  law and morality are two very different things . 
  in this case , the law says it 's the patient who gets to decide and only ** then ** the doctors do all the proper medical and psychological assessment to either authorize or deny access to the procedure . 
  the paper you linked talks about physicians who practice euthanasia without the patient 's explicit written consent , thus ** breaking the law ** . 
  it does n't really matter that it 's morally acceptable to them . 
  it 's still a crime . 
  morality is only relevant as long as a law is being discussed . 
  once a law has been passed by democratic means , whether you morally approve of it or not , you have to follow it , or else you face prosecution ( and if you really think it 's wrong , you can still campaign for changing it ) . 
  i think you missed the point . 
  what i 'm saying is that what you call `` your body '' is not actually yours . 
  it 's just a temporary , mutating arrangement of the universe that somehow results in a self-consciousness that you call `` me '' . 
  but as soon as you die , whatever connection may have been there between `` you '' and that physical body is lost forever . 
  so , your only true legacy will be the knowledge , the wisdom , and the memories you bequeath to others . 
  your physical body just becomes part of the environment for those who are left , and they have every right , as a democratic society , to decide how to dispose of it . 
  you 're made of atoms that were there before `` you '' and will be there after . 
  actually , since most of the cells that make up your body are replaced every few years , billions of atoms that were once part of you are already part of someone else by now . 
  what you call your body is but a bunch of ever-changing particles that the universe `` lent '' you . 
  so if you really care about your so-called legacy , you should focus on the intangibles , rather than worrying about your physical body . 
  the only way to be `` immortal '' is through the memory of the living . 
  [ full reply tree ( aka context ) ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/52dif3/the_sad_reality_of_smoking_in_greece/d7jem9v?context=3 ) . 
  well , it 's thanks to that press conference if i have this beautiful nickname ( misspelling included ) . 
  i was talking about being bad in general , not specifically the smoking thing . 
  the user i was answering to said that in southern europe we all have a tendency to break our own laws , but greece seems even worse . 
  yep , can confirm . 
  whenever i happen to see a eu statistical report of some kind , the greeks are very often the reason we are not dead last ( and i love you guys for that ) . 
  or , more likely , lack of [ bidets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bidet ) . 
  initally it was reported that laicist lower-rank officials had seized power from the pro-erdogan generals and it seemed that most of the military were following their orders . 
  now it looks like the pro-coup soldiers were only a small amount and ended up surrending to the police or even to the civilians . 
  a few thousands of unarmed pro-erdogan hardcore supporters are not going to make any difference as long as the military is unanimously pro-coup . 
  italian tv ( sky ) reported that laicist lower-rank officers took hostage the generals appointed by erdogan and seized the power from them . 
  apparently the army and air force almost unanimously back their new commanders . 
  police forces might still be loyal to the government , as is a large chuck of the civil population ( possibly as much as a half ) . 
   still though , might help out with the aul ' football team further on down the road , silver linings and all that ... why would you want a bunch of english losers on your team ? 
  they 're just pretending in the hope that [ you 'll let them have those juicy irish passports ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-ireland-passports-iduskcn0zd1ka ) . 
  let me tell you , it 's not just spain ... 
  the fact is that italian is currently still in use there . 
  obviously , it 's not the native language for most of them ( except in bolzano/bozen where italians are a sizable majority or meran where it 's 50/50 ) , but they all learn it as a second language in school . 
  so yeah , since you can speak german , you definitely want to go with it in south tyrol ( just like i 'd go with italian if i went to ticino in switzerland ) , but for those who do n't speak german , italian is a better bet than english most of the time . 
  not anymore , really . 
  at least not if they know you 're only there on holiday . 
  you still were n't independent though , that 's why it does n't count ... 
   `` low cost '' ( for lack of a better word ) brand i think the correct terminology might be '' [ no-frills ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_frills ) brand '' . 
  if you can persuade them , help yourself . 
  but i sense that the majority of south-tyroleans would n't be so keen on such a prospect nowadays . 
  we currently grant them the highest level of autonomy , which basically means they get to keep almost all of their taxes , as well as passing a lot of legislation on their own . 
  if they were to join austria , they would just be one of the many * l\u00e4nder * ( or whatever they 're called ) , if not just a part of a bigger tyrol . 
  just make sure putin does n't hear you though ... 
  oops , i totally missed the joke there . 
  my bad . 
   the early 70s was the golden age of south tyrolean terrorism it was actually the 60s . 
  and that 's beacause , even after the fall of fascism , we initally tried to limit their self-governing power by having them be part of a single autonomous region with trentino , so that they would still be a minority even at the regional level .
