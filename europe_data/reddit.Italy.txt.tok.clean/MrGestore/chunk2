  and i 'm quite afraid you definitely know anything about it and am absolutely sure you should take it less seriously ... 
  oh i care , love carrot cakes and cinnamon buns so i 'm quite pleased of starbucks opening , will be easier to find those things, 
  i take my coffee with no sugar , if that 's what you mean by black . 
  but not american coffee of course , that is just filthy water and i rather a way more flavored and creamy espresso, 
  beautiful town , great to swim in the lake . 
  the museum of animation is really nice , lots of nice places to eat . 
  10/10 would recommend, 
  i know chap would love to make a holiday there though . 
  since i was a teen i wanted to go to gucha too , for a week long crazy party . 
  maybe one day i would join the 2 things and visit the balkan region properly, 
  yep , tomorrow morning i 'll go out to buy a pack of cigarettes and , while i 'm at it , drive for those 10 hours straight to buy a 15 $ or less coffee maker, 
  definitely is personal preference , italians are split in 2 on the matter as well, 
  not even 1 $ in most bars . 
  hell , a 2,50 $ espresso would cost 0,50-1 $ more than a cappuccino, 
  [ we like variety too ] ( https://i.imgur.com/mvpwinv.jpg ) . 
  just say a name , not 23 combination of words to have a slightly different order, 
  thank you !, 
  edit : it 's on amazon !, 
  buying it, 
  ehy , if godspresso orders me to sacrifice my child on mount coffiah i comply . 
  absolutely not . 
  coffee machines for homes come in a huge range of prices , and with around 100-150 $ ( like this [ 130 $ delonghi ] ( https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/b003yc1eb0/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=utf8&amp;camp=3370&amp;creative=23322&amp;creativeasin=b003yc1eb0&amp;linkcode=as2&amp;tag=macchinadelca-21 ) or this [ 100 $ saeco ] ( https://www.amazon.it/gp/search?ie=utf8&amp;camp=3370&amp;creative=23322&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=poemia&amp;linkcode=ur2&amp;tag=macchinadelca-21 ) ) you can have a good enough 1or2-cups coffee machine . 
  it 's not the cheapest stuff ever , moka will always be cheaper , but half of italy will say is not as good ( the other half that is better ) . 
  no , it 's not . 
  giove punish them who are close minded, 
  because bitter is good , bitter is life, 
  half the frames for a third of the dimension of the cup ( i could n't find a good long gif of an espresso making ), 
  coffee flavored coffee , on the left is poop flavored warm piss, 
  coffee is to be taken as bitter s it gets , any sugary substance ever should be treated with capital punishment as per impero romano traditions . 
  enjoy fighting some lions, 
  we have a lot of different coffee servings but yeah , almost all of them ( if you exclude cappuccino , caffelatte and friends ) are in the espresso size , the only true coffee size, 
  i 'd rather sacrifice my children than make instant coffee, 
   black piss is the only real piss , end of . 
  we agree wholeheartedly, 
  do n't be silly , a good espresso machine is another dimension of deliciousness than any moka ever , as much as i like my moka . 
  only coffee that can get near it is the one done with caffettiera napoletana, 
  if you have sediments in espresso you did it wrong , that 's why you like black piss, 
  implying `` drip coffee '' should have a dignity and being called anything but black piss . 
  that 's why you are uncivilized !, 
  it 's sugar , to sweeten the coffee ( even tho coffee and sugar is like pizza and pineapples ), 
  that 's a good coffee , what 's the name of that kind of coffee machines , balkan brother ? 
  well , first of all coffee is to be taken without sugar , whoever break the law will be sent in uk the day before brexit !, 
  anyway besides coffee grounds is also about pressure , water used , temperature and the coffee machine , all of these things are important for a good espresso, 
  still shitty sadly, 
  apparently is final and they will open it fo ' real, 
  definitely due to the lenses . 
  it 's more or less 1,3 km from the point the photo was taken to the castle at the end , while in this picture it looks nearer . 
  cool though, 
  this pic used the same trick as the one in sofia from yesterday , am i right ? 
  that should be piazza vittorio , being the end ( or the start ) ov [ via po and getting to piazza castello ] ( https://www.google.it/maps/dir/45.0641613,7.696448/45.0705393,7.6865986/@45.0672349,7.6879039,1601m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!4m1!3e2?utm_source=app-invite&amp;mt=8&amp;pt=9008&amp;utm_medium=simple&amp;utm_campaign=s2e-ai&amp;ct=s2e-ai&amp;utm_source=app-invite&amp;mt=8&amp;pt=9008&amp;utm_medium=simple&amp;utm_campaign=s2e-ai&amp;ct=s2e-ai&amp;invitation_id=493454522602-29907689-e58f-41ad-9dde-bac7e927f427 ) with castello degli acaja at its center ( the brick castle you see at the end of the street ) . 
  via po is actually 700m long btw . 
  oh i saw op already delivered on the location . 
  wait you do n't have them in uk ? 
  here in my country old people 's daily routine consists also of checking the new dead ones on the obituary board around the city , like [ this one ] ( https://imgur.com/nghwtza ) . 
  so kentucky , what are you like ? 
  whatcha do in your spare time ? 
  then i 'm really sorry for you as a human being . 
  you 're totally brainwashed and dehumanized , i really have pity for a person that enjoys become more and more like a caged animal controlled 24/7 by its own fascist country . 
  i hope you 'll start using your brain and hearth one day , cheers . 
  no , i do n't make it sound like that , it is like that . 
  proof is the countless users ^ check ^ just ^ in ^ this ^ thread ^ to ^ see ^ it ^ by ^ yourself and [ politicians ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-minister-david-davis-eu-referendum-single-market-free-access-article-50-negotiations-a7220191.html ) still claiming the right of having free market . 
  it 's full here on the internet , it 's full in the [ real world ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/16/uk-voters-want-single-market-access-and-immigration-controls-poll-finds ) since you voted that stuff , but maybe you 're starting to get what exiting meant . 
  you were a burden when you were in the eu ( and never forget , you begged to enter the eec , which became the eu decades later , and were a founding state in the actual eu , so you were literally a part in every decision that led to the eu of today , but you have short memory ) , now that you 're out we finally do n't have to deal with you anymore . 
  also i see how much you like to be in control , you just passed some protofascist laws that limit your personal liberties and privacy rights lol , you got brainwashed and buttfucked and did n't even notice . 
  mamma mia to you too, 
  i 'm not british, 
  page 3 girls are gon na have a fun time though . 
  maybe they 'll start watching themselves in the mirror, 
  quite so , since eu were crystal clear since the beginning . 
  the little crying and spoiled baby was the country you 're from , not who stayed by its word during all these months . 
  even more of a confirmation of how delusional you are is how you cowardly avoided to answer to the way more articulate post of / u/manthew , but replied to me right after my post . 
  laughable . 
  it will be real bad , expecially if they wo n't be able to make new deals with other countries and institutions , now that the eu is lost . 
  yeah , but a successful negotiation for both parties happens when the two parties are even . 
  they are not . 
  but they wanted a scapegoat and found it in the eu . 
  now that they got rid of it they will have to face reality and it wo n't be easy , so they still have to tell themselves some fairytales . 
   it 's about being adult about the situation , not a petulant little brat . 
  wow , that is just delusional, 
  we 'll get over it, 
  nah , he 's just being pedantic, 
  i did n't say it 's only like french , has a lot of terms in common, 
  piedmontese is also a lot like french , not only valdostano, 
  fine by me, 
   defend your rights to be humans . 
  ftfy but yeah , in your egoistical society it 's fully understandable how you forget that . 
  take your altright , racist bullshit out of here please . 
  it only sounds pathetically funny from a country full of such cowards that first ruin other countries with made up reasons or their own interests , then refuse to help them and leave them in ruin after doing whatever they please and even feel the right to bitch about other countries policies when they decide to not be miserable pussies and let other human beings die . 
  grow a pair and learn to deal with the problem you created before talking . 
  then people undestand it 's said by an australian , and not any aussie , but the one which designed some of the ( if not the ) most inhumane and criminal immigration policies among the 1st world and disrespectful towards human rights and one has only to laugh . 
  conceding anything to the uk would mean mining the foundations of ue . 
  even if that is of the 5th economy in the world , forgetting that the ue got anyway the 4th , 6th , 8th and various positions under that making us as a whole the second biggest . 
  and what uk buys you say ? 
  please . 
  to take on your example ( which was made many times already and debunked many more ) uk buys almost all his gears and components for cars from ye old europe and the market of imported cars is as big as the one of uk cars to the ue . 
  even in only just that sector uk would have way more to lose , bad example . 
  what uk offers is not fundamental , what buys is anything that could n't be sold elsewhere and its supposed requests are absolutely nothing ue can accept without saying a big `` fuck you '' to each and every one of the other member states . 
  sorry but i only see seek of protagonism and naivete from the english people , a constant seek for attention and a way to say `` hey , we 're here , we matter , look at us !, 
  '' , fact is what uk has to offer after exiting is of no importance compared to the importance of the eu . 
  we understood it 's the 5th biggest economy , that 's what you ( those ? ),
