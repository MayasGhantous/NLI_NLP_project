  guys keep repeating to give yourself ( themselves ? ), 
  strength and convince each other to not have fucked up . 
  you ( they ? ), 
  did and not even being the 5th economy will save the ass when discussing the new deal and sure as fuck no free market without the other rights will be conceded . 
  britain export nothing that could n't be outsourced with no big difficulties and is n't that big of a market to lose , confronted to the rest of the eu , to have any word or deman in the discussion . 
  on the other hand the eu accepting any free market/no free movement would have only to lose , because mining the ground of the eu itself . 
  i fail to see how uk could get anything they want . 
  i do n't think he/she was being totally serious , read the second sentence and then the third, 
  you are actually arguing it and know full well they committed fraud . 
  proof of it is how you accurately avoid answering to / u/steppdeckenwolf because you literally have no way to answer to that and know he 's right , but too pussy to admit it . 
  sorry but i fail to see how is anyone 's but the traveller 's fault if that person buys a ticket for another eu destination but , being a cheap mate , decides to make stops outside eu . 
  secondarily , referring to your previous message , [ norway allows ids and not only passports ] ( https://www.visitnorway.com/plan-your-trip/travel-tips-a-z/?lang=uk ) and as far as i know never got back from schengen , that means that id were always allowed as valid documents . 
  they reactivated border controls , but that still allows showing national ids to enter . 
  also can you please be more specific about which northern and southern eu airports are you talking about ? 
  so i can check if it 's true what you say and these unlucky people 's only way to travel is really by making a passport and pass thru a non schengen airport . 
  because shitty lowcost companies like ryanair fir 90 $ take you from north to south europe with no connections , so i was wondering ... 
  thanks , 
  what kind of question is that ? 
  what if i have to fly from rome to berlin passing thru tokyo ? 
  usually a person knows what his destination and connection flights are way before leaving , so he should use the brain and ( if needed ) make a passport . 
  source of the 50 killings and the deportation story to morocco ? 
  got it . 
  in my experience ( and the people i was together with ) i always travelled in all europe and uk with just my italian id and never had any problem . 
  i think that , if netherlands have another kind of id ( i just checked and [ they do ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_identity_card ) ) , that would be enough to travel to and from uk . 
  english people do n't have documents like this , but that is an english problem , because dutch people [ can travel without passport to the uk ] ( https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control/before-you-leave-for-the-uk ), 
  ` ndrangheta is formed by littler clans , usually family tied that strenghten the relations with other clans with combined weddings and brainwash their family all life to the importance of clan and family . 
  even people working outside of the town of birth depend on the orders from the town of birth hq . 
  that takes to a lack of pentiti . 
  think about selling your dad and brother . 
  then think that they maybe will go down , but you just sold family ( and you were conditioned since you were a child that was the 2nd most important thing , after the clan ) and you know from your traditions that they wo n't forgive you , your children , your wife and probably whoever has blood or close friendship ties with you will be thaught a lesson . 
  cosa nostra instead became bigger and bigger , did n't limit their close connections to family , thought to be invincible and decided to fuck up big time with the state and also got hurt by many more pentiti . 
  [ bernardo provenzano ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bernardo_provenzano ) was kept in 41bis even when he could n't interact with other people anymore , when you 're in there it 's quite hard to get out , god or sister death have to give a hand sometimes . 
  the success of ` ndrangheta is also due to their nature . 
  while sicilian ones were somewhat larger , these other ones are smaller , very close , super private and almost like a sect , with blood and religious rituals and shit . 
  it 's hard to find people who repent , it 's hard to track them , to listen to them and whoever betrays them knows well he 'll put at risk himself and all the family . 
  and if they caught and do n't talk they could get [ 41bis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_41-bis_prison_regime ) which is no joke either . 
  as far as i know those are the numbers , migrants that come these years usually want to pass thru italy . 
  in italy ? 
  moroccan and albanian , mostly ( circa 1m ), 
  sort of like bolo\u00f1a, 
  well i guess it 's time for the english people to stink again . 
  the smell of freedom , am i right ? 
  you were not . 
  no common market with no eu , if you want one you get the other and it was like that since before you joined . 
  so if you wanted common market you decidede to join eu by yourselves , now do n't cry like little bitches because you decided to throw in the sink all you had gained . 
   see you in 20-50 years can you please not come back ? 
  we really do n't miss some rubbish, 
  also were n't the uk workers really butthurt and sour pussies about polish and other east european people `` stealing '' their jobs ? 
  which is which ? 
  nice seeing many cities i 've lived ( and still live ) on reddit , i could pinpoint almost all the picture of center-south piedmont, 
  and the cheeses !, 
  nobody fuck with out cheese, 
  because that works anyway for the sake of making a map with equal population . . ? 
  the criteria is equal amount of population , it 's even written in the title . 
  i gave you the reasons , but seems you 're not happy with any reason whatsoever . 
   i am in no way trying to defend brexit positions , if that 's what you think , that should be obvious . 
  also , i do n't think i used any `` you '' for that reason , so . . ? 
  because that 's not about what uk wants , let 's be clear about this : uk has no word . 
  it always was about being all in or all out and that 's it . 
  uk decided to go away and must and will deal with that in its entirery ( not that we lost anything from a country that always was nothing but a leech to the eu , wanting all the benefits and none of the problems ) . 
  so the internal free market is one of the pillars the eu is created on ( aka free movement of people , goods , capitals and services ) , and expecially everything concerning the internal free market is under the title i of the treaty on european union ( meaning that if you want free market you need to be in the eu or have a treat with them , like swiss , and you take it all or take nothing ) . 
  uk actually had all , but decided to lose everything , so yeah , why the fuck should they have any concession ? 
  more importantly , why the fuck the eu should get so low to deal with a country that despises its concept and just decided to opt out and even let them ( the losing and weak side ) decide what they like or not ? 
  i honestly ca n't understand what point are you trying to make and what 's so hard to understand ? 
  what ? 
  are you serious ? 
  yeah , i love rubber . 
  i love many many things about french cuisine , but no , i have no love for their bread . 
  [ my country ] ( http://www.vitadidonna.org/cucina-e-salute/gli-alimenti/8424-il-pane-italiano-tipi-varieta-a-b-8424.html ) takes the prize for me ( this page takes only a to the a-b list ) and even the average premade german bread is superior and has more variety . 
  because that 's the foundation of the european single market and european union . 
  it 's all or nothing . 
  wow you must have really weird ( to say the least ) tastes . 
  but hey , better than liking shit i laughed at bread tho , nice joke . 
  being in the eu means single market and free movement . 
  you want one , you get the other ( three ) . 
  you do n't want one , you get shit . 
  the sense is simple as that . 
  btw wikipedia , about the european internal single market ( aka what we 're talking about here and what ** you ** are - badly - trying to talk about ) , actually states [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_single_market ) :  the european single market , or internal market , is a single market that seeks to guarantee the ** free movement of goods , capital , services , and people ** -- the `` four freedoms '' -- within the european union ( eu ) . 
  emphasis mine . 
  that 's what our single market is , at least learn to quote the proper articles . 
  any source of trying not by war and conquer ? 
  also roman empire , really ? 
  honest question , do you know history ? 
  thye fact that there are many italian immigrants does n't mean shit . 
  source : am italian , travelled with family all life long ( uk , france , germany , belgium ecc ) , met countless italian families and went to countless italian restaurants , found ** maybe ** a half a dozen good pizzas in over 20 years . 
  i think it would matter even less : 1 . more pizza for us !, 
  i do n't think we export pizza from italy to uk 3 . anyway , more pizza for us !, 
  what list is that, 
   i have yet to find a country that does better deserts than the uk it 's literally on the other side of the canal, 
  and we do that in europe too ( eg : italy ), 
  we proceeded to forbid fascism by constitution and saved millions of refugees during many decades ( and still do ) , did n't forget what those hate ideologies did to us like they did with their blatant racism mantained to these days . 
  what the fuck of an excuse is that ? 
  we do n't want foreigners because we 're different ? 
  are we joking here ? 
  coward collaborationists to racist ideologies 75 years ago and now , nothing changed . 
  good job , poland , eu is really proud of you and your total lack of any historical memories, 
  no more prayers ? 
  gosh !, 
  check his answers , it 's pretty clear / u/theoleslippydrip is quite a coward with no arguments, 
  are you quoting your previous reply ?
