   romania comes from latin and if a hand me down from the romans . 
  is true , rome also gave them full citizeship at the time , proto-romanian comes from latin ; in italy we call the roma people , `` rom '' , not roma , the reason it 's obvious . 
  and we know the difference between a romanian and a rom . 
  yeah , i discovered d\u0105browski just the other day , in the anthems thread , but i could n't image that was so important for you ( also due to my lacks about history of some countries ) , well this is a real til . 
  thank you !,

  well ... since i was searching ... [ link ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/alpinism ) [ link ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mountaineering ) , 
   i think that some words here has been misunderstood/misplaced . 
   i think your definition of mountaineering is mistaken . 
  that 's why i tried to explain with my own words the differencies ; gon na tell you in italian , montanaro = / = alpinista . 
  edit : found out that you can call montanaro `` mountaineer '' ... 
  yes and no ... 
  since is sicily , iirc , they had a huge period under islam/moors ( too lazy to check atm ... ) and if i look at the women 's hats , i see a lot of `` arabesque '' ( 2nd and last pic , the base of the headgear ) and same goes for the n. 9 , the helmets of the guards . 
  edit : with arabesque i mean a lot of decorations , not the pattern . 
  i think that some words here has been misunderstood/misplaced . 
  on one hand we are talking about `` alpinism '' like expeditions , highest peaks reached , exploration , in this case english , as you said , did a lot . 
  on the other hand , i guess is what u/standy85 meant , is about `` mountaineering '' as living the mountains and on the mountains , know how to live on them , how to work on them , and so on . 
  is like saying `` italy best sailors in the world cuz colombo & vespucci !, 
  '' , that is not true , great explorers does n't equals to great sailors . 
  sry for bad english .

  i suggest ( if any of you can ) to go to the louvre , and see it . 
  circle around it , to have a 360 \u00b0 view ... and if you can ( and if the louvre gives this opportunity ) try to put eros 's wing against a window ... you 'll gon na see how thin the the wings are , how transluscent they are , you should crave to touch them and chip a piece ... ( plz do n't do it ... ) anyway , [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/amor-psyche-canova-jbu07.jpg/562px-amor-psyche-canova-jbu07.jpg ) and [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/amor-psyche-canova-jbu06.jpg/500px-amor-psyche-canova-jbu06.jpg ) there are some 360 \u00b0 views ... 
  i guess more or less all these kind of theatres have good acoustic , if you mean the phenomenon of standing in the middle and whispering , i do n't know if taormina has the same . 
  velvet everywhere ? 
  yep , i 'm not sure , but this one is smaller than epidaurus , ofc romans rebuild this one on an already greek existent . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:taormina_bw_2012-10-05_16-23-06.jpg ) from another angle . 
  yep, 
  i got it now . 
  [ this is italy equivalent , sung by a french band ] ( https://youtu.be/o-8wlzcmd0a ), 
  well , i dunno where and from whom you learned latin , i had 5 yrs of latin in high school ( talking about 20 yrs ago , in a liceo scientifico , if i 'd chose ginnasio and after liceo classico , i had also ancient greek for 5 yrs + ancient latin ) . 
  in italy they only tell you that is a difference in pronunciation between `` classical '' and `` ecclesiastical '' ( like `` veni vidi vinci , in classical should be pronounced `` weeni , weedi weeci '' , if you are non romance speaker or , using classical , and `` veeni veedi veeci '' if you use ecclesiastical ... as an italian that studied latin , switching from classical to ecclesiastical pronunciation for me there is no difference , i can go both , one sounds `` fancy '' another one sounds like mass at sunday , easy peasy basically . ), 
  since we do n't have recording of live voices from classical latin , we ca n't say if even those pronunciations are right , only ecclesiastical survived for obviously reasons ( example , vatican city and the pope ) but is based on oral traditions , what you refer as `` regional variant '' are basically `` writing styles '' of historians of the time ; this means that back when i was in hs , if in a test you had a `` version '' from cesare talking about gallia , it was easier to translate cuz `` you already know his style of writing '' , that means cesare gon na refer with that word in that context to that meaning or nuance of the word/term ... and the dictionary book already list the different meaning/use of that term related to the author and to the time he wrote . 
  it happend to me in a test during hs , my teacher gave me a recipe on how to cook lamb in ancient rome , can you imagine searching all the words from an low-studied author , with some `` technical '' terms about cooking and seasoning and spices ? ...

  dear french cousins , can we talk a little about marseillaise lyrics ? 
  i mean ... there is something brutal there ... p.s : top lyrics for an anthem ... no joke . 
  by me , one of the best . 
  you wrong , `` il canto degli italiani '' , aka `` fratelli d'italia '' , aka `` inno di mameli '' was written in 1847 by mameli , in 1946 was provisionally chosen , in 2012 was made official in law . 
  yes , correct . 
  you can also book the entire tram . 
  :d np ... upvote for you anyway !!, 
  and ... did you pay the fine ? 
  #teamyurop guys ... spread the word , yo !, 
  well . . / u/roma _ victrix , tbh , i do n't like personally power metal and stuff , and i dunno who sabatons are and why they made a song about italians and greeks ... pls , do not take offence ... but i 'll take your incipit about `` european freedom fighters of the past '' ... and , if i stop for a sec , the only songs about it ... is [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/m17nzq4gjkg ) , in this version made by ( i guess ) a french band ( all credits to them , literally chapeau ... hands down ... ) so , i try to listen to sabatons again , about this `` coats of arms '' ... but ... 
  i ca n't think about [ this version ] ( https://youtu.be/oyma84-mowi ) of the song of the `` freedom fighters '' of europe ... made by a serbian ( you can go to the sziget festival , is cool , yes ... but , if you can , once in your life , go to [ guca trumpet festival ] ( http://www.guca.rs/ ) ... no fancy wine or sophisticated beers ... ) , goran knows how to party ... , 
  i live on garda  if you like [ lugana ] ( http://www.wine-searcher.com/regions-lugana+-+lombardy?tab_f=bestvalue ) those are from lombardy 's side ( personally i always have a case of `` ca ' dei frati '' or `` ottella '' at home ), 
  this chart/site is kinda tricky , they seems to list grapes , but also they list wines ( prosecco ) and not the grapes ... for lugana and and garda 's area , maybe they omitted them due to the fact that those wines are just one step above `` vino da tavola '' , so not so `` prestigious '' ... 
  ... you right , but nothing can compare the sea in greece ... 
   first , not sure why they chose the colloseum ... maybe because 60 yrs ago in rome they signed a treaty that evolved in today 's eu ? 
  yes , also miss in that area valtenesi , garda classico , groppello , chiaretto ... 
  those are basically grapes varieties , not wines . 
  barolo is made from nebbiolo grapes , barolo si the name of the town ... 
   as a wine , falanghina can have a slight pine scent , but is better known for its citrus-blossom aromas , in particular bitter orange . 
  on the palate it typically shows classic apple and pear flavors , depending on where it is grown , with spicy or mineral notes .
