  however , the race had to be cancelled due to the delay in building the new chassis for the new race cars . 
  * the track was praised by mark webber , who stated that he `` did 10 dry laps today around mugello , which is the same as doing 1000 laps around abu dhabi track in terms of satisfaction '' * * four-time formula one world champion sebastian vettel was impressed too , saying that `` unfortunately we do n't have this track on the calendar . 
  it 's an incredible circuit with a lot of high-speed corners '' * * on the other hand , vitaly petrov from caterham f1 complained that `` it is not safe and wide enough . 
  if you lose it , the walls are so close and you will smash into the tyres . 
  it is not for formula 1 and , if you lost the steering or the tyre pressure dropped or whatever , then it will be a big crash . '', 
  nevertheless , it holds a grade 1 fia license , meaning it meets the standards to host a formula 1 race .

   the lighthouse of genoa ( italian : faro di genova , but simply called lanterna ) , is the main lighthouse for the city 's port . 
  besides being an important aid to night navigation in the vicinity , the tower serves as a symbol and a landmark for the city of genoa . 
  at 249 feet ( 76 m ) it is the world 's fifth tallest lighthouse and the second tallest `` traditional '' one , built of masonry . 
  since 1543 and until the construction of the lighthouse on \u00cele vierge in 1902 , it was the tallest lighthouse in the world . 
  considered as a whole with the natural rock on which it stands , as it is commonly perceived and represented , its height is 383 feet ( 117 m ) . 
  it is constructed in two square portions , each one capped by a terrace ; the whole structure is crowned by a lantern from which the light is shone . 
  rebuilt in its current shape in 1543 replacing the former lighthouse , it is the world 's third oldest lighthouse , following the tower of hercules in a coru\u00f1a , spain , and k\u00f5pu lighthouse , on the island of hiiumaa , estonia .

  materazzi , as a player , was a cunt , everybody knew it ( even zidane ) , on the other side , zidane was n't a saint on the pitch , everybody also know this , both true statements ; difference lie in the middle , zidane lost his head during a wc final , this is a fact . 
  materazzi was `` clever '' , `` smart '' , `` cheeky '' , italians do not `` overlook '' what he did , it 's football , every game you have trash talking from both sides ( they are not ballerinas ... ) , if zinedine had a mental breakdown during ( probably ) one of the most important game in his life , it is his own fault , only blame himself . 
  maybe if he did n't headbutt marco , and stayed on the pitch , they all went to penalties anyway , or maybe not , maybe zidane could score the winning goal , maybe not , maybe a good pass for a goal , maybe not , maybe he could score the winning penalty at the end , maybe not ... maybe , maybe , maybe ... 
  * hey man you see that guy over there.jpg * ... 
  ... let 's say he ( was ) a though guy ... 
  welp , zidane  materazzi , obviously ( inside and outside the pitch ) , but , hey , only 3 nt have at least 4 wc ... ;p, 
  him who ? 
  yesterday night , 20:50 - 32 \u00b0 c - garda lake ... 
  gi\u00e0 per queste cose ci sono dei mangiarane in giro , se poi si mettono anche i veneti ... purtroppo molti di loro sognano ad occhi aperti , e lo dico da lombardo ... anyway , i 'll leave alone the politics in this post , just enjoy the stunning view of tremiti , i had the luck to go there , friend of mine own a house ... 10/10, 
  flair check , enjoy jesolo ... 
  fucking useless , and i 'm from lombardy ... 
  i do n't get it , what so cool about phytoplanktons and venice ... ? 
  you ca n't compare automotive sector to food sector , i can build an economy car , or any other machine , pretty all around the world if i have the knowledges on how to craft and assembly it . 
  in this case , the discriminating factor is the `` workforce '' , train enuff any individual from any part of the world , and you 'll get the perfect vw `` das auto '' quality ( skoda is an example , or seat , or even citroen/fiat vans , dacia/renault and so on ... ) in the food compartment , is different , you could try to grow some kind of vegetables ( for example ) in different part of the world , but will not be same , regardless who 's gon na grow them , even if they are skilled as much as the original growers ... 
  so , for me , until they use a `` traditional '' method ( in this case of the video , you can see a guy , non-sikh that `` beats '' the cheese wheels with a little hammer , well , you ca n't replace him with no one in the world , unless he gives away his method ... good luck ... ) for making cheese , and they make it here in italy , using products from italy , if the hand that collect the milk is sikh , or italian , or german or japanese ... still an original product ... 
  can ... can we ... [ ** can we make panavia tornado great again ??? 
  since you posted that video , and thank you a lot for that , i leave [ this link ] ( http://www.caseificizani.it/en/ ) from another dairy farm , little n from cremona , hope you 'll notice the `` new '' products ... , 
  i 'll be more angry if i 'll see `` italian '' on a cheese made in germany , or made in poland , or new jersey or whatever ... as a guy who lives very close to cremona ( where the video was recorded ) i am fully aware of the sikh 's situation , being working in the same field ( farming ) ; they are good people , trustworthy , hard workers . 
  assholes in other countries think that if a sikh in italy can produce parmigiano reggiano , is no longer parmigiano ? 
  well , they deserve to eat plastic food ... 
  this is a good example of real work first , and after , integration ... 
  i have no problems , my country got rid of nuclear plants and waste , afaik ... if it 's all good for them , who am i to judge ... ? 
   try to explain people that make 500 $ a month of which more than hallf is spent just to survive oh , well , i wish you could come here in italy atm and you 'll gon na see no difference in that ... and i come from a country that have no nuclear plants , and only lately start moving to renewable ... mark my words next time you gon na see the italian national debt and ask yourself a couple of questions ... 
  playing the `` eastern-poor '' card is not a good idea ... 
  i already answered about nuclear energy and the ratio , check my comments ... 
  it was said that was impossible also on chernobyl , but still today is not on my top list for holidays , yes , the technologies made huges jumps in security , but you can never eliminate the risk of failure . 
  population boost , yes , but why do n't start from now to search or create new way to get energy , maybe invest in renewable ones ? 
  i mentioned even kite-powered farms ... instead on relying on non eu countries for slags ? 
  also , people here talking about `` ee '' countries , and want to still depending from russia , probably , in the next months , in this sub we are gon na see some people from those `` ee '' countries whining against the same russians ... 
  i mean , dafuq ... really ? 
  weaponizing the waste ? 
  maybe , i dunno , it could be ... but who cares , they are in siberia , am i right ? 
  seems that you are missing my point ... 
  as i told before , i 'm not overlooking nuclear , i said is the most `` profitable '' source of energy atm ( ratio between investment , managing -  power output ) but there is a big difference if the shit hits the fan on a reactor than a flock of geese hits a wind turbine ... if you know what i mean ... 
  oh sure , let 's keep all `` ee '' under siberia 's dump , cuz , the relationship with ru atm are just fine , am i right ? 
  eu did n't sanction in a some way ru ? 
  it 's all fine , all good with the neighbour from the north ? 
  right ? 
  they gon na even make discounts if you dump scorie in their lands ... ? 
  so why even bother joining the eu ? 
  relaying on a crucial point as energy productions/consumption , specially for ee economies , with the love/hated motherland is ok ? 
  i bring out my country slags ' treatment for a reason , but , ehy , if some or a lot of ee country want depending on russia ... 
  * [ who took the jam out of your doughnuts ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/-ns14hrqwy8 ) * edit : oh , well , it could be , but we need to talk about $ urodollars ... ** a lot of $ urodollars ** , 
  so , just build a nuke plant and after bury the slags in s poland ? 
  is that what you are saying ? 
  are you sure ? 
  ... well ... just tell to / u/jjbregsit , not me ... :p, 
  i 'm not being facetious , i 'm aware what `` eco-friendly '' means , i can draw a parallel with e-cars vs traditional engine , both have downsides , is just to see the one with less downsides ... and ofc the environment gon na take the burden , it always had and always will , and it always adapt ... but , i can predict and correct the alterations and choose the place for hydropower dam , and the environment gon na adapt , or i can force to adapt ( thing about when mankind passed from hunting to agricolture ... ) same goes for windturbines , i can put nets for birds preventing the killing ... and so on ... 
  but what when a reactor fault ? 
  i have a huge zone that for the next 50 yrs ( let 's say 50 ... ) the surronding is literally fucked up , not even the environment can work as fast to re-gain a `` friendly '' area , both for humans and for flora & fauna ... where i can stock scorie ? 
  that takes hundreds of yrs to become `` safe '' ? 
  ofc nuclear is the most `` profitable '' energy source atm , if we do n't care about possibly downsides ... if we skip slags , theirs treatment , stocking and so on , probably , by now , renewable are the way , solar , wind , hydro ... even kite-powered sea farms ... you ca n't create energy , you can only conserve it ... sry , angrish ... 
   that is what all of ee does . 
   i am not sure where france dumps . . choose one , my country is waiting from 2017 to 2025 98 % of our ( former ) nuclear plants 's ( produced before 1987 ) scorie to come back after been processed from la hague ( fr , 2025 ) and from sellafield ( uk , 2017 ) , does n't sound to me siberia ... 
  so , this is poland 's masterplan ? 
  btw , siberia * . 
   eco-friendly sure , do you have a 100yrs minimum plan for treating the slags of those `` eco-friendly '' plants ? 
  or , poland have a space program to send the slags on the moon ? 
   does he keep watching after he 's done ? 
   now that would be weird ... [ ... oh , how much `` bad '' ... ?

  good hints ... tbh , and is my fault , always thought s germany ( after alps ofc ) could go `` flat '' until achen , up north to berlin ... that 's why i 'm surprised ... 
   the stupid plan to privatize the deutsche bahn same here man ... as for the stations , if you look up verona - bologna , do a little google search about the 2 cities , well , like , 10 yrs ago ( dunno if they planned to power up the line ... ) between the 2 cities there whhere only a 1 line railroad , that meant , at one point your train had to stop and let the other train pass ... wtf plus , from bologna to bari ( geeez , could we think for a sec about tourism ? ), 
  no improvements ?
