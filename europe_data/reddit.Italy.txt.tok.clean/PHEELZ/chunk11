  so , romania is not against taking refugees , unless they could set theirs own `` assigned '' quote , i 'm not here to convince them to stay in an `` x '' eu country ( ... it 's been 10 + yrs that no one want to stay in italy ... guess why ... ) the problem is about `` manage '' them when they come ... and , for obviously reasons , they unload on italy and greece , and we have to `` manage '' them and identify them ( due to the places they come from , is not easy to track who 's good and who 's bad , and contact governments and meanwhile , we have to `` keep '' them , feed them , give clothes to them , take care of them ... ) and hold them in cie , basically , first aid is upon our shoulders ( check valona ship from albania back in 90 's ) ... and it sounds funny , for some , when a nations like italy or greece , or even germany ( thinking about yrs ago about munich 's trains station full of immigrants after frau merkel said `` komm in deutschland refugees !! '' ... 
  less than a week , munich 's station was knocked out ... ) asks for help and the others ( late joiners of eu market , w/o adopting the $ ... ) are cherrypicking about 2k or 6k immigrants when have a population of 40m , 20m or 15m or 5m ... does it reeks communist for you ? 
  , well , it reeks socialism for me ... p.s. . . no hard feelings , ok ? 
  it is related to [ this ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romania-supports-now-eu-refugee-decision-09-23-2015 ) ? 
  edit : more from the same article ...  `` four countries , romania , slovakia , hungary and the czech republic , opposed the proposed quotas of refugees . 
  but other member states forced the vote to pass , using an eu rule that allows certain decisions to be made without a consensus . '', 
  ... and ...  president iohannis has several times said romania wants to help europe deal with the migrant crisis , adding that the country can take in only 1,785 migrants , due to limited capacities . 
  edit :  as yet , romania has not been hit by the wave of refugees of migrants crossing the balkans towards germany and western europe . 
  only 913 people have applied for asylum this year , 12 per cent more than in 2014 . 
  but polls show many romanians do n't want any refugees while those who are more open to taking in immigrants say the country should decide on the number and not be forced to accept a figure set by the european union . 
  missmatch here , check / u/mezmare post and my reply , if you can get it , i think i 'm not the drunk one here ... anyway , whatever ... 
  i 'm not , are you ? ... 
  p.s : why you think i 'm drunk ? 
  if you have links about the 4k/6k , be my guest , really , i 'll be more than happy to read about romania ( as , for a lot of reasons , how i ca n't sympathize ,  ) not facing the med means , you are not facing massive unloads on your boarders everyday , from ships , rib 's and stuff ... 
  i hope you get it ... again , as for you , pls do not take my poor english as offence or innuendos , i 'm not here for fight or `` represent '' something ... ok ? 
  pm me if you want a `` chill '' conversation ... ok ? 
  oh , well ... and after make another march 14th 1891 , w/o italians this time ? 
  fyi polish gov have a link in english ( check discussion here ... ) ... 
  i 'm waiting for the korean ones , as you said here ... ( since the migrants are unloaded on it 's coast , could i suggests you to ask your govs to put the italian translation ? ... eh ! ), 
   we always helped when needed , however we could . 
  could you `` host '' 2k migrants ( every , like , 6-8 months , well ... you , as nation , do not face med ... ) for , let 's say 1 yr , schedule them , contact embassies and stuff , try to send them back avoiding any uno 's sanctions cuz `` hurr durr , you kept them like nazi 's camp '' ... ? 
   if i do not want to give up a big part of sovereignty and risk to end up like greece ok , so , if me , as an italian , i do n't want to pay money for hungary via eu cuz `` they do n't wan na lose / participate in the union '' and i want them out and do not participate to free markets and put borders tax against them , send them basically 20 yrs back , am i a `` real '' italian ? 
  a real `` patriot '' ? 
  a true `` roman '' ? 
  this could be also for ger , or fr , sp , pt and uk , fin , swe , cro ... and so on ... well ... imho , i 'm not , i 'll be only selfish , ofc i 'm first an italian , but after 1k and more yrs , i would like to be european , after all ... do n't take my words as offences or innuendos , i 'm glad to have this type of `` interactions '' with fellows europeans , even if we disagree ... , 
  meanwhile , could you pls take 2k migrants in ... like ... 6 months ? ... 
  or should italy and greece , and after , only after , germany , have to carry the burden ? 
  sry for broken angrish , pls do not take offence from me ... really ... 
  ok , so `` profiteer '' is a good term for an hungarian like you ?

  ** words of wisdom **, 
  afaik there are differences between `` industrials '' fridge and `` home '' fridges ... that affects temperatures ( like -4 / 6 from -20 ) ... 
  ... it 's ok , just [ gib weisswurst ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/59/66/04/596604fbbabe290d4074b873a13fb5d5.jpg ) ... we can find a deal ... 
  ahahaha ... omg , maybe , it depends from how old are they and , this is my case as i am a partner in a farm , where they work ... but usually if you are italian , by default , you should know that sheep 's cheese is good if is from lazio or sardinia ( pecorino ) . 
  grana and parmigiano is from emilia-romagna , mozzarelle and burrate are from campania/calabria/puglia ... and so on ... 
  the bag\u00f2ss is a very very very local product , i 'll not be surprised if 2/3 of italians never heard about it ... 
  sad to hear about cellulose , i mean , here if you buy grated parmigiano or grana , you already aware that ofc is not top notch cheese ( talking about `` industrial ones '' , for pasta 's topping and stuff ) but at least is made from real cheese ... reading the article , maybe , again maybe , is the ageing in u.s the problem for hard-cheese ... my own 2 cents ofc ... 
  ... well , i agree with you ... ok ... all is fine ... , 
  me , mad ? 
  why should i be mad ? 
  ... `` yes '' ... `` thank you , me too '' . . 
  go cali for fresh , about nc , i dunno what temps range and `` heights '' you have there , goats & sheeps are good , ask frenchies , add herbs to them , top noch , imho , but not sure about nc , prolly they should try grana padano or parmigiano reggiano style , but again , the problem could be the ageing , where i 'm from we have [ this ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/bag%c3%b2ss ) ( sry only fr and it ) hard chesse + saffron ... the small valley-town where it 's made refused any other producers ... we are in the `` hypsters-sphere '' of cheese here , more than [ cazu marsu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casu_marzu ) :d,
