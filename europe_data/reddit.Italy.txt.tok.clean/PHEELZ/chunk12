  [ old story ] ( https://www.altroconsumo.it/alimentazione/sicurezza-alimentare/news/mozzarella-blu-le-indicazioni-del-ministero# ) ( even hard to find something in english ... sorry but is an italian article ... :d ) having a buffalo 's moz for you in the u.s ( meaning original one , like from campania or calabria , is already hard for me , i live in n italy , that means , 2/3 days `` old '' moz ... ) some products from trader joe 's could be good , as prolly they buy locally cuz shipments/logistics , or , as happen here , they pick a good supplier that fits `` your local '' taste ... as far as i can suggest , as an italian , buy local dairy 's products , is basically what we did for years here ... , 
  [ oh cazzo . . ] ( http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/175/637/16d.jpg ) ... 
  [ it 's ok , whateva man ...  ] ( https://youtu.be/-ns14hrqwy8 ), 
  where i live i can buy fresh food for 4 days and make 4 or 5 different recipes for at least 4 days for the same amount of money lidl sells this `` lasagne '' , cheaper and fresh , less than 45 mins for recipe ... did you get what `` italian cuisine '' means now ? 
  no probs , [ here ] ( http://ricette.giallozafferano.it/lasagne-al-verde-con-pesto-di-rucola-e-ragu-di-polpo.html ) some lasagne with rocket 's pesto and octopus rag\u00f9 , sry is in italian , , 
  it 's not about `` italians '' , the ones in op 's `` could '' be lasagne , very `` weak '' , but they `` fit '' the definitions , as rotten grapes are both wine and vinegar for everyone else in the world , as rotten barley malt fits the `` beer '' definition for the rest of the world ... , 
  ... sure ... ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) edit : so , if we want to fit definitions , also beer is that same as wine ... no ? 
  ... same as leaving grapes go rotten is wine ... or vinegar ... it fit the definition , no ? 
  well , where i live we have a lidl , and sometimes , they pick local products ( in my case they buy prosecco that for the price/quality ratio , is not bad ... ) that are made in italy ... 
  ravioli , tortelloni or agnolotti ... 
  this is a good `` incipit '' , in italy we call it ravioli , tortelloni or agnolotti , and also here , are n't so popular , i mean , they are good and you can vary the filling , usually as you , we use melted butter and sage as topping ... 
  i know that in the east they have sort of `` pierogi '' , but they cook them with steam , but afair the filling is meat , so very close to `` our '' , dunno if other nations in europe are used to this kind of dish ... , 
  [ ... well ... get ready ... ] ( https://youtu.be/q2cx20bbnje ) no pierogi gon na save you ... / s, 
  the pics on the label is enuff to take away my sleep ... 
  o mamma mia , just hope r/italy do n't find out this `` lasagna '' ... 
  i know i know the `` pula '' things ' ... :d ... 
  strange to me that some spanish do n't comes up with `` polla '' ...  btw , still one of the best kept arena around ... 
  why ? 
  3rd best `` anfiteatro '' in the world / s. 
  cuz is an `` antique '' way of calling it ... 
  like ... [ bacalhau on pineapple ] ( http://nst.sky.it/content/dam/static/contentimages/original/sezioni/masterchef/uploads/2013/01/tiziana-stefanelli2.jpg ), 
  also in italian it refers to soul ( maybe latin 's heritage ... ) and , also as finnish , is an old female name in it ... wtf, 
  i 'm confused ... 
  afaik could be related to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_throwing ) , very popular in tuscany . 
  thanks !, 
  ehy , serious question ; has the sagrada familia a `` dead-line '' now , or still a continuous building site ? ... 
  well , instead of oslo , why not troms\u00f8 ? 
  ... so , better let 's go back to marino or maybe alemanno ? 
  ... ergo ... `` to big to fail '' , o sbaglio ? 
  ok , now in italian , pls ... 
  sssshhht ! ... 
  do n't spread this !!, 
  ... do you mean the `` too big to fail '' thing ? 
   `` all the working people in my family are frontalieri '' that means they are italians working outside the frontier of italy , in this case , in swiss ... because that what `` frontalieri '' means ... and as the / u/chairswinger said , the trick is here , some swiss can not afford to live in sui ( my guess is you and your people are from ticino canton , am i right ? ), 
  and go work just ourside the border , but , get payed in francs ... and use the suiss `` welfare '' ( do n't be afraid , also `` frontalieri '' from fr and ger do the same ... ) to get the maximum from both welfares ( your case ita/sui . . but again , there are fr/sui , ger/sui cases ... ) . . so that 's why in this maps `` seems '' that swiss gon na `` migrate '' in it ...  and yes , italy is a mess again , i take for granted you are a ticinese , is clear from yours statement + `` frontalieri '' thing ... not all italy is mess , some places are , some places not ... hey , no one is perfect !, 
  but again , you reeks as typical ticinese ... and if you go in my comments history , you can clearly saw where i 'm from , but i 'll leave you some hints : [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_banana ) [ . . and here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/four_motors_for_europe ) ... no hard feelings , ok ? 
  yep , my bad , already self-answered :p,

  life 's cost ( dunno if is the right term in english ... ) for retirement is lower ... 
  have you ever hear about `` frontalieri '' ? . . 
  get paid in sui francs , live in italy with euro = profit ... ( in the last years with the change , something changed , but was a good deal back in the days ... )  and a mess . 
  lol .

  clickbait title , imho , as the article 's title is ** `` francesco totti leaves the field , and romans weep for a living monument '' ** , nice try op . 
  for who gon na read the full article , is a good read ... 
  i suggest [ this one ] ( https://www.theplayerstribune.com/francesco-totti-as-roma-italiano/ ) there is also an en version . 
  francesco 's story is a real modern fable ( and im saying this from a non-roman , juventus supporter ... ) , even if you are not a football 's fan , no need to bring in roma city 's problems ( nor other capitals or cities in eu have any problems ... no ones is perfect ... ) , so thank you francesco , good life after the retirement . 
  here some links about the `` xiii king of roma '' : [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6dvoh0/tottis_farewell_speech_translation/ ) [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/ysasfynttii ) [ and here , click subs ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-qbq-wqthk ),

  yeah , is a thin border , same goes for ours `` carriers '' [ garibaldi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_aircraft_carrier_giuseppe_garibaldi ) and [ cavour ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_aircraft_carrier_cavour ) ... and as i stated in another post , it 's a long story about ger and it army after wwii , same goes for japan ... 
  ... until there is a frank-something ... is ok for me . . :p, 
  quite strange , en wiki list juan carlos as amphibious assault ship ( wasp-class ) ... 
  `` vesuvio '' is the correct form in italian , [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_vesuvius ) ... vezuvio is ok , is a little spell mistake ... stromboli , etna , vesuvio are the volcanoes of italy , basically ... 
  which `` fucking aircraft carrier '' spain 's own ?? 
  0.2634 / 0.2772 ... it 's ok , keep in mind the `` big nerf '' after wwii , ger more , we little bit less ... wonder why france today have a catobar in the med and we stick to svtol , and , why both ger and it needed to make a consortium for panavia tornado and eufighters ... 
  this time ze baguettes haz nukes , no easy stroll in paris for you ! ... 
  back in the days , we were n't the only one signing stahlpakt , and the day after the signing you went full anschluss on poland , a little ruf-phone would be appreciated ... today , frenchy navy is good , can not gib you meds supremacy ( even not back in the days cuz you were too anxious ... and , yes , we lied a little bit . . blame uncle benito , he had been tricked too by italians ... ) ... 
  but dear kartoffel , thiz time i think not even cipan gu\u00f2 can help uz , seems he still under ptsd after h-bomb , he only thinks about hentai and futa ... / s,

  exactly , mines was , already said , a very very worst case scenario where eu will be alone , again , military + `` military supplies '' and u.s alone ... u.s by hiself is ok , today , basically u.s have atlantic on one side ( good luck everybody to deploy carriers ... ) and pacific on the other ( that 's why u.s have 11 aircraft carriers ... )  it just sucks that america has to do so much by ourselves . 
  no one asked `` to do by yourself '' it was and still be , your decision , cuz , again , you basically are an `` island '' between 2 oceans ... mine scenario was about u.s as enemy against eu ... ( hardly happen , aka nuclear warheads ... ),

  ... oh , am i right to guess that `` gay '' in the name does not means `` gaivs '' like ancient romans , but it means what it means in modern times ? 
  am i right ? 
  i was only thinking about `` brutal '' military ... now , i am not * entirely * sure when you put on the table capitalism vs war ... ( i mean , i 'm aware why wars are sparked in last 50 yrs , aka monies ... ) but i was only talking about `` military capabilities '' ... leaving outside soem ( big ) sides of a modern war ... edit : broken angrish ... plz understand , 
  yes ! ... 
  and again , i 'm a pessimist , so i figure out the worst case scenario ... germany , small coastline , no need to build big ships , ok ? 
  but , rheinmetall , good heavy industries , right ? 
  great cannons bores ... ok ? 
  so , guess what , leave france or italy shipyards , you guys build tanks and connons ... and so on ... ** again , i 'm speaking about wars ' worst case ** ...
