  going to answer here about yours comment about eu vs. anglosphere ( dunno how to link specific parts of a comment in reddit , so please , enlight me , via pm , really ... ) mine was a [ extrema ratio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extrema_ratio ) scenario , ok ? 
  if this scenario , in your opinion , never going to happen , ok , all good ... no probs , life 's goes on ... but what if ? ... 
  that 's was my hint , that / u/revolutiontu explained better ... and that what yours last post is about ; if the eu 27 ( again , thinks uk out for a sec ... ) gon na `` integrate '' a military `` scheme '' ( check tornado jets , or eufighters jets , or even it and fr fremm/horizon ships ) , maybe we ( eu 27 * ) all can save money and do not pay more for self-defence or depending on from outside eu ... is a real big topic for me to write , so sry for broke english ... 
  / u/revolutiontu and / u/jan _ hus ... the latter , no difference about % , check latest / r/europe submissions ( atm ca n't link exactly ... ) but just try to make the math about % on military spendings in the eu 27 ( let 's for easy reasons skip uk for a sec , ok ? 
  ) ... and let 's imagine that the threads comes from ** outside eu ** and not ** rus/china/india ** involved ... ok ? 
  is just a `` game '' ... let 's think for a sec in the light of u.s `` hurr durr gdp % / military spendings '' vs. wwiii and nato could be fuck up ... leaving only u.s ( and maybe britain + anzac with 'em , merely military + geographically speaking ... ) against a ( theoretically speaking ) united eu military force ... does n't matter atm who 's gon na be in charge of the military in eu , only number and geography ... can you figure it out ? 
  even w/o nuclear warheads deterent ( again , i only count fr ones ... ) imho , it 's a orwells ' scenario , that 's why , even if is a joke , i personally do n't like when people says `` hurr durr germany % nato or own military % low , lol '' etc. . . 
  since i 'm speaking to 2 germans here ( and i do n't know your age ... ) , i read/studied about what ger made in 5 yrs when she had planned to go to war ( italy was behind , at the time , let 's not talk about japan ... but , this is a long story ... ) so , in ours peers time , if `` my '' worst case scenario could happens ( look above ) , do you think that a united eu is not capable of really `` big '' flick of the tail , military speaking ? 
  since is only an opportunistic joke , the 2 % or whatever % germany gon na put in nato , is pointless , imho ; they do n't even need to negotiate with u.s , aka germany do not need to spend more , they are surrounded by allies , eu members , that in an `` theoretical '' war scenario , gon na sum up their % plus all the others memeber % ... you make the math ... :p,

  the `` real deal '' about it ship 's names is the [ `` caio duilio '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_destroyer_caio_duilio ) , that comes from this [ guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaius_duilius ) . 
  the motto of the ship is : `` numen nomen '' ( `` in ( its ) name the strenght/vigour '' he basically invented the [ `` corvus '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corvus_ ( boarding_device ) ) and won the carthagines ' fleet . 
  rome dedicated a [ columna to him ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/mcr_-_colonna_rostrata_di_c_duilio_1150130.jpg ) ( called `` rostrata '' ) , on the side you can see the prows/rams of the beaten ships ... maybe , he was a kinda of `` pirate '' ... ? 
  hnlms de zeven provinci\u00ebn ( f802 ) ... one of the coolest ship ( design ) ... + cool name :p,

   i deleted the one from / r/europe after it did n't get upvoted . 
  i also posted ugly suburbs of nantes , and an italian ( / u/pheelz ) kept complaining in the comments that i dared posting that . 
  he even went on in other threads . 
  so , you are only doing it for the upvotes !? 
  i did n't `` kept complaining '' ... i only pointed out that in the nantes ' ( lecorbuisier iirc ... ) one thread you tried to pass an ugly example as a good example ... nothing more , nothing less , and after , you deleted the post . . never gave you a downvote for your pics , the opposite , always like your pics , you have a good `` sight/eye '' for beauty ( maybe you are an architect , or artist ... dunno . . ) . 
  and even in the `` nantes ' incident '' ( :d ) i gave you some incipit about `` ugly '' and reasons why they are ugly ... and , if you searched a little bit , you could find some `` beauty '' . . let 's say [ `` sublime beauty '' ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zp_y011qnmq/takhokbpbfi/aaaaaaaaegk/htcib9m7dko/s1600/vele%2binterno%2bx%2bsito.jpg ) or [ `` decadent beauty '' ] ( http://www.campaniasuweb.it/sites/default/files/articolo/immagine/201311/vela2.jpg ) even in my link ... :p ** edit : ** since is 4hr from this public reply and also from my pm ( ... w/o any response by you . . ) to you about this stupid `` beef '' , and is a clear fact that i do n't ever `` complaing '' about you , about nothing , i politely need to ask you to ** do not quote me ** directly in yours post or replies to yours ( deleted ) posts ... 
  if you have to tell me something , just answer to this post , or just keep your silence about me in posts that involves pics about europe .

  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_lucy ) , in n. italy is the 13th december , is a very `` big '' feast for childrens , as big as santa claus . 
  usually , you should leave outside some sweets for lucy 's donkey on 12th 's night ( she ride it ) on a plate , and she 's blind ( her eyes should lay on plate ... ) and `` announce '' herself with `` hand-bell '' , that means you must go to sleep if you want presents ... omg is lucy a big deal in europe ?

  nah , a lot of waste and shit stays up valley ( po starts from turin + a big delta , a lot of things lay in the riverbed ... ) problem is , sediments , a lot of sands on the coast ( rimini-riccione ) and n , venice ( lagoon ) again no sea bottom ... 
  mainly is because of sediments aka , sands ... 
  exactly , families mass-tourism place ( aka `` our '' swimming pool '' ) , if you go s to apulia is frikking good ( look at google maps ) ; i would suggest , whenever you can , to go s. sardinia , calabria ( everything s of rome ) and sicily ... or , plot twist , pre-alps lakes ... 
  our side from like lignano sabbia d'oro to rimini riccione , naturalistic scenery speaking , is awful , i mean , yes you have the sea , but is more like going to a swimming pool ... sand for meters from the beach , families place , cheap fish restaurants ... is ok , for a mass-tourism ... no pearls to discover ( gon na get downvote for this ... but , hey , is the real deal . . ) going s on coast you can maybe find spme good place , and then you get to apulia ( basically split heights ) and is gorgeous like your side ... but lacks mountain , is basically flat in the inner-side . 
  n part of croatia already lost , imho `` the real experience '' , and is close to mass-tourism ( is not a bad athing , ok , is just different ) s + isles could compete with meds . 
  if you can , go once in sardinia , s of the island ... and also sicily and calabria . 
  to me ... meh ... seriously now , i 've been in croatia yrs ago , oto brac ( sry , too lazy to change accent word ) , stunning , the sea was as good as sardinia ( mark my words ... ) could n't believe was adriatic .
