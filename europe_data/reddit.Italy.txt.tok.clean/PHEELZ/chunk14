  so , you suggest that only elder people could run an office ( 45 + ) , is n't what is basically happening ? 
  again , just curious , no fight , ok ? 
  . . mmhm . . like , you can vote when you are , i dunno , 25 till you are 45 , before and after this age , you ca n't vote and ca n't run for politics ... ? 
  something like this ? 
  so , basically , when one became `` too old '' for voting , we should `` ban '' him ? ... so ( and this is an hyperbole ) even if did n't grew up under fascism or stalinism , since he is `` too old '' , we take back the right to vote , and after , what ? 
  euthanise them ? 
  cuz they are too old ? 
  ( ... so we can save on retirements ' paycheck ? ),

  can confirm `` avaro '' in italian today means `` stingy , cheapskate '' ... usually for italians , people from genoa/ligurians are `` avari '' af ... , 
  so , is it kinda correct to say that celts at one point were `` squashed '' between teutons and romans ?

   do you really think posting a picture like this is encouraging them ? 
  quite the opposit this yours opinion ... btw i found one good example of `` social housing '' ( i 'm sorry , but i 'm getting old so sometimes names slips away ) ... [ this is one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/d%c3%b6bling_%28wien%29_-_karl-marx-hof.jpg/1200px-d%c3%b6bling_%28wien%29_-_karl-marx-hof.jpg ) i personally suggest instead of the `` bee-hive '' made by lc ( and i 'm a great fan of lc ) ... still , i ca n't find the windows-rounded one ... edit : [ this ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2015/4/22/1429696338791/a9f6da2a-d5e1-4654-8825-125d335b3e65-2060x1389.jpeg?w=620&amp;q=20&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=60dd69a1a427f6a72b7c02c1779e5865 ) is what you find when you pass the arches in the front ... 
  no , we should not encourage them , do n't you ? 
  especially in social housing , or should we do like bee-hives commuters hotels in japan ? 
  is not strange opinion , is simply different than yours ... 
  ... maybe ... like [ this ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_irpnh4wutcg/th501xsveai/aaaaaaaaahi/8xyjtunjv3i/s1600/vele+francia.jpg ) or ... [ this ] ( https://static.fanpage.it/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2015/01/vele-di-scampia-638x425.jpg ) ?

  is the ugliest part dude ... 
  do you mean ... juno ? 
  right ? 
  rationalism failed when it came on social housing , as your picture proofs , is far away from interesting , it has been the base for social ( ugly ) housing in 2/3 of eastern europe in the years to come ... people = working bees ... atm i cant do a deep search , but should be a condo made by lc that looks like a `` ship '' , with rounded windows and made like savoye 's villa ( means 3 orders from botton to top ) , but this , is not interesting at all ... i 'm sorry , even if you usually loads great pics ... imho , this is a no-no ... 
  did you really choose this one from le corbusier ?

  that 's why i tried to explain surname 's as in italy , so , do in spain the son take the mother 's surname ? ... 
  so that 's why picasso is named after his mother 's ? 
  portugal , fuck yeah !!, 
  ! ... is that what portugal caralho means ? 
  as an italian , we use the father 's surname , not the mother 's one ; and the bride takes the husband 's surname , the sons , get the father 's surname , so , picasso ( if the father recognize him as `` natural '' son 's ) should be named ruiz , but , if he did n't , pablo got the mother 's surname , in this case , picasso ... sry for the broken english , hope you got it ... 
  i got your point , i 'm not here for blaming dutchbat or dutchies as a whole , just to be clear , yugoslavia 's war showed , imho , the worst case scenario for a `` modern '' conflict , that means two armies + civilians in the middle ... yours guys at the time , should take initiative and , at least , try to protect the civilians , even at risk of their own lifes , ( pls do not take offence , really ) but , as you said a lot of bad decisions were taken and add a fucked up scenario at the time ... ( i can recall a newest case about italians in afghanistan with frenchies that issued in a dead of some french soldiers , and we took the blame ... but , we are `` subscribed '' to the `` bad guys '' or `` incompetent '' club in the armies ... so ... is just another story ... ) i hope the dutchbats case will be remember , not for the blame on one side to another , but to show how difficult this kind of missions are ... 
  thank you , really thank you for pointing this out , i 'm not joking ... as i saw that meme , i still remember those days as a 12 yrs old kid , seeing `` remove kebab '' nowadays make me uncomfortable ... and seems some people that `` praise '' that meme do not remember ~ ~ [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/profughi_della_vlora_in_banchina_a_bari_8_agosto_1991.jpg/2880px-profughi_della_vlora_in_banchina_a_bari_8_agosto_1991.jpg ) ~ ~ edit : i pasted the wrong url , i 'm really sorry guys , had many tabs opened , and i got the wrong url cached ...

  i 'm surprised that a portuguese does n't read all the messages chain here ...  milan is a little n than your map ... is `` worse off '' than you ... p.s the map you linked is not op 's map ... 
  austria/other side of the meds ' = bff omg < 3 portugal/close to spain = worst neighbour , get f *** off ... 
  i mean classic spain ... oh , also n italy is cutted off ... / s, 
  half italy * according to this map ... 
  this implies that dutchbat 's known to not move a finger even if a massacre has been protract under their eyes ... ? 
  ok , so , once the peace is estabilished , and a riot/fight starts , do those `` peacekeepers '' step aside and watch people fight each others ? 
  right ? 
  do not even try to stop sides from fighting , cuz you ca n't even use lethal force ... if the other two sides uses lethal force ... 
  given this , why do send them in first place ? 
  p.s ... 
  i 'm not here to blame anyone for what happened ... just to be clear ... 
  so , why they are called `` peacekeepers '' ? 
  what is their purpose ? 
   dutch soldiers become soldier to protect dutch citizens so why they were sent abroad ? 
  i mean , sebrenica is not rotterdam ... 
  . . well ... enjoy s italy ... , 
  milan is a little n than your map ... is `` worse off '' than you ... 
  lel ... do you really want s italy ? ... 
  well ... ty dude , i would make some `` edgy '' reply at your post , but , as you said , it will start a shitstorm 4.0 ... so , ty for the * congratulazioni * ... :p,
