  if you watched `` mediterraneo '' with in mind the `` brava gente '' myth , you got it all wrong ... 
  i do n't know who `` they '' are ... 
  if the word `` celebrate '' is the problem , well , always `` they '' need to study english a little bit more ( ... or better , latin . . , ) to understand what the verbs means . . 
  but that what 25th april exactly means for italians ... is not a celebration , is a memorial day ... 
   for what ? 
  so italians can party and ignore all the blame ? 
  here you are very wrong ... 
  i already answered at another user ... 
  stills , it seems the roman empire at his maximum expansion , not eu or europe ...

  [ another view ] ( https://i2.wp.com/www.langolodeilibri.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/canaculex.jpg?w=1000 ), 
   their small economy is in shambles , they have a smaller total gdp than croatia with over twice the population , buying them off would be quite cheap . 
  ... so buy them , croatia ... where is the problem ? 
  smaller gdp , twice population ... 
   so , you are out ... croatia ca n't into mediterranean ... what ? 
  welcome to adriatic sea ... dubrovnik is basically at the height of pescara ... just google maps , soz for you  it is only a big `` channel '' ... :d  france does not have a migrant sea crossing route . 
  oh , our `` cousins '' ( france ) learnt how to deal with immigrants ( you `` maybe '' know , they had a big colonial empire back in the days , like italians had romans , so they are used to deal with `` foreigners '' ... and if you check history 's tunisia , algeria , and part of morocco and more ... were under their influence ... i skip mali ... sry )  so is all good if you get eu monies , but is `` lol why me '' if you have to host immigrants one is not tied to the other . 
  oh well ... so a 60 millions people 's country should stop contribute to eu budget yearly ? 
  or even italy 's most prolific region ( lombardy ) should gave up ? 
  well , croatia alone could supplies that ? 
  plz make it happen !!!, 
  ( i think you should give a phone call to berlin , paris , amsterdam and madrid and made up an excuse if you can do it ... )  fmw ? ... gn , thanks for the talks ... 
  i would say the same , but i have no idea what the fuck you are talking about most of the time . 
  oh , sweet summer child of mine , at this point , even if mods gon na ban me , i must use a [ meme for you ... ] ( https://youtu.be/xzpndhtdl9a ) good night ... sleep tight ... , 
  send yours ship , if you have one ... ( or buy some from italy ...  fremms looks slick ... trust me )  well , ideally it would be all of us mediterranean eu states so , you are out ... croatia ca n't into mediterranean ...  i would say the same to spain with their crossing . 
  france is optional for you ? 
  sure it is ... cuz croatia ca n't again into med 's politics ...  so , make a vote in croatia asap and accomodate 10k immigrants before july ... ( does n't matter where they come from ... ) lol , why ? 
  so is all good if you get eu monies , but is `` lol why me '' if you have to host immigrants , fmw ? ... gn , thanks for the talks ... 
  wise one ... 
   you easily could . 
  think for a sec as an italian , how can we stop it ? 
   no need , a simple naval blockade would halt everything . 
  why always us ( italians ) ? 
   of course not . 
  so , make a vote in croatia asap and accomodate 10k immigrants before july ... ( does n't matter where they come from ... ), 
   yes , because why the hell should we accept illegals that you should not be accepting in the first place ? 
  we are trying to sort them and grant access to the rights ' one but we can not stop a massive flow on ours coast or we should start killing them with our navy ... even if my angrish is broken , can you get in your head ???? 
   because why the hell should we accept illegals so you do n't want the worst part of being in eu aka accept a part of immigrants ?? 
  tunisia is not a `` hot '' spot ... lybia is worst for immigrants ' route ...  but , as i already told you , since we are `` founder 's '' member , we can not do whateva we would like to do yes you can . 
  so , if croatia says `` you go italy ... just fuck 'em up !!!, 
  you got the `` member 's badge !! . . '' '', 
  are you nut ??? 
  again , if you have ships , you go first !!!, 
  i do n't want my country been fined by eu cuz we started a frikking war ... again , you go first ...  but you , croatia , can you accept 1k/2k immigrants this summer and do as i stated in the previous post ? 
  like this ... we try , but they escape back to germany and sweden . 
  you must be new to this game , is like 20 + yrs on the coast 's of italy ( and i am not counting albanian 's exodus during yugoslavia 's war back in the 90 's ... you should know it ... ) that they do not want to stay here and go north ...  you are not making any sense . 
  so , basically , if italy 's navy gon na drop 2k people in spalato in july , cuz you are a member of eu and you should take some of them , is not making sense ? 
   people are drowning by the hundreds exactly because you refuse to close down that route . 
  we tried back in the days , with gheddafi and berlusconi , and all the international community went batshit crazy `` cuz hurr durr , italy you gon na talk with terrorists and dictators , hurr durr !!! '', 
  ( and check my other post about it ... ) ... and again , italy is not gon na pull `` an orban '' ... and after , gheddafis ' gone , so , as italy , we can not talk with anybody in libya , cuz , there is not a stable government in lybia !!!, 
  but , as i already told you , since we are `` founder 's '' member , we can not do whateva we would like to do , you asked me a lot of questions , but you , croatia , can you accept 1k/2k immigrants this summer and do as i stated in the previous post ? 
  like this ...  feed them , record them , talk with the embassies of theirs own countries ( if they still have a so-called country/government ? 
  ) , organize a flight ( or a ship ... you choose ) and send them back if irregulars ? 
  can you ? 
  pls ? 
  ( oh , if not you , let 's say bulgaria , or slovenia , or poland , or czech republic , or lithuania , or estonia ... you choose ... can you guys pls ? ... if yes , use yours leverage in the eu and make it happens , cuz , italy and greece already are doing a lot about immigrants since decades now ... ), 
   you have one of the most powerful navies on earth , including two aircraft carriers . 
  ... so , nevermind if we rescue children that are drowing for whatever reasons and our `` mighty '' navy bring like , 1000/2000 of them ( with parents ofc , in a 10 days time span ) at split 's port ? , or some of yours islands ' ports ( close to apulia ) and your government feed them , record them , talk with the embassies of theirs own countries ( if they still have a so-called country/government ? 
  ) , organize a flight ( or a ship ... you choose ) and send them back if irregulars ? 
  ... good luck ...  italy could simply state protectionism , italy has the right to deny any ship within its naval borders . 
  sure , but we are eu 's founders , we ca n't simply `` deny '' any ships , you know , cuz , we have the `` founders '' badge like in online games ( belgium , france , luxemburg , the netherlands and germany ... maybe one of them gon na be `` wtf italy ??? 
  did you really start shooting 76mm naval cannon on ribs !!? 
  '' ... who 's gon na take the blame ? ... in his constitution , italy repudiate war ... just saying ... ) p.s : we do n't have `` real '' aircrafts carriers ... they are no catobar , you must page france for that ... ,
