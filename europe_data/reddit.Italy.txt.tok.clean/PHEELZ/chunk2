  ... in exchange , i did a quick search and found [ this pdf ] ( http://www.albertoperconte.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ita-gre.abc1.pdf ) with prefix/suffix from greek , most of them are used in `` technical '' fields , like medicine , engineering ... edit : link, 
  and viceversa latin ... in the `` vino '' post , some greeks said about `` eno '' , in italian we have `` enologia '' , `` enoteca '' ... italian keeps a lot of prefix from ancient greek ... 
  did n't know that greek borrowed a lot from latin tbh , also in italian porta means door ... , 
  apulia ... magna grecia i guess ... we also have the `` omelia '' that means sermon ...

   alcoholics are the same all over the world , just classier in europe .

  / u/doomblackdeath said in another post that is from louisiana , so , i never met any `` southerns '' from us irl ... but due to my interests , both work 's and `` fun '' 's related , they seems warm and kind people , at least is how i picture them in my mind ... he maybe did n't gesticulate whilst typing as a `` supposed '' real italian ... at the end , he should be born on the [ bayou ] ( https://youtu.be/qvqqzmroeqi ) ... p.s : he even maybe hook on spain 's paella , like , real one ... so , give him credits ... ,

  during the summer in italy , you barely reach 40 \u00b0 c in a constant way , maybe except rare spikes of 40/45 \u00b0 ... and s italy usually is ventilated , so you do n't perceive so much hot ...

  oh , now i get it , thought keto was only based on low carb , is the keto a diet for body builders ? 
  well , the mediterranean diet is basically plant-based foods ... edit : mediterranean does n't mean pasta and pizza ... 
  ye probably climate is one huge factor , but also fresh produce and vegetables ; when i was there , i do n't remember a `` heavy '' cuisine , a lot of salads with light dressing ( mostly evo based ) grilled fresh fish ... 
  seems like a diet close the mediterranean 's one .

  did you forgot the '' / s '' at the end of your answer ? 
  well ... sry for you and for france , but in italy , getting a frag granade like the m67 ... is not so easy ... at least you are a criminal ... but stills a unicorn to have such weapons here ... 
   plaster grenade i hope ... or maybe a stun granade , cuz , if a teen could get a frag granade ... 
  it depends from the rifle ... i 'm more worried about the handguns and nades ... 
   hazing ? 
  edit : which rifle ? 
  hunting one 's ?

  question : dassault family is the same of the fighter airplanes ? 
  carbon-14 dating ... or simply try to find info about when was planted , another method , but is not reliable , look at the log , diameter , height and if there are `` twisted '' branches around the log ( twisted branches means that the tree has been cutted at the base for `` regenerative '' purpose ) . 
  like [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/051210-sal%c3%b2-italy-marius.jpg ) is about 150ish years old ... do not cut it to the base if you do n't need olives for oil , just pruning it ... 
  fr/sp/pt are easily recognizable for me ( maybe pt is the least ) , same for finnish/estonian ; nl/ger/aut in english sometimes are not so easy to spot , same goes for w slavic , ca n't hear the differences . 
  for uk , i just can spot differences from scottish/cockney , us/aus is easier . 
  most difficult : irish , they sound `` flat '' , like , no accent , and e slavic/ru , ca n't tell difference . 
  [ neuron ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dassault_neuron ), 
  well , if this chart is based on properties/houses owned , i can tell you that in italy ( at least the region where i live ) at least `` wealthy '' people owns 2 houses ( one where you live with your family and usually one at seaside/mountains for vacations or a property ) some have even 3 houses + property ... a newly married couple first thing first they buy/build a house ... 
  wow ... starting from chickens , cows , pigs and rhinos and we are already at stalin ... that escalated quickly ... 
   milions of chickens , cows , pigs ... the answer is just under your eyes ...

  ... and , how well do romanians understand people who speak italian ? 
  `` furansu-san '' ... make my day, 
  welp ... [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xvwwrid.png ) a view about dialects in italy , [ this is a xpost from / r/mapporn ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/41ashd/incredibly_detailed_map_of_italian_dialects_2000/ ) ... so , at some time , we needed a common language to talk each other , and even today , some italians can barely or do not understand each other if they speaks a `` strict '' and fast dialect . 
  ... mmhmm ... interesting , try also a little spoon of olive oil in the water , `` undercook '' it about 1 min , and check if the pasta is made from durum wheat . 
  at first :  i did n't put cream in the carbonara though . 
  ... and after ...  the carbonara was the dressing  ** why !!?? 
  you were the choosen one !!!, 
  i already heard about `` diesel '' ( if the term for coke + beer is correct ) from you germans , as i live in a tourists place with a lot of germans in the summer , radler is ok for me , i mean , do not sounds so savage , am i right ? 
  or just add some water that you used for boiling the pasta itself ... 
  welp , yes , is true ... shorter and hollow shapes ( conchiglie for example ) could be good for rag\u00f9 or other `` thick '' sauces ( salm\u00ec is another one ) because `` standard '' pastas are made from durum wheats , so they tend to not absord the liquid part of rag\u00f9 , but , thanks to the shape , the can retain some meat . 
  the tagliatelle are made from eggs and flour , `` handmade '' fresh pasta , is more coarse so the sauce sticks better on the surface and it can absorb the liquid part of sauces , that 's why in bologna they use them with rag\u00f9 . 
  have you seen the small pot in the background on the left 's one ? 
  yes , or/and different colors or embroidery patterns ... 
   strangely the `` babaric version '' looks better . . ... * crying in bolognese * ... 
  drinking monster energy drink is basically the same ... 
  go for the easy speaking , just ask `` al sangue '' steak , and you get the maillard 's grey one ... :d,

  i 'm sorry ... so , how do i call that exterior ... let me think ... do you mean the link of the steak ?
