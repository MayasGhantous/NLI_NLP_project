  well ... i thought it too ... and , yes as already told you , in italy we eat both cooked meat ( gave you a link too ) and raw meat ( linked too ) , and a lot of others worldwide appreciated dishes , except , that our dishes do look delicious , taste delicious and are fecal free ... , 
  oh , well , good point , inside/outside ... yes , in italy we also eat fine [ raw meat ] ( http://sanmarcovenice.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/san-marco-116-bearbeitet.jpg ) is called `` carpaccio '' , or , [ `` steak tartare '' ] ( http://apostcardfromfrance.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/001-1024x682-1024x682.jpg ) ... you should try it once , the exterior looks exactly like the interior , and raw meat seems to help you build muscles , but i do n't believe it , tbf ... speaking of it , what worries me , and i already explained to another swedish ( guessing you are swedish , ofc ) is , as you said , the outside/inside of [ swedish `` cousine '' ] ( http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/03/05/ikea-pulls-almond-cakes-after-fecal-bacteria-found/ ) ... cause in your case , i could understand ...

  first try to look for pdo/pgi trademark ( pdo  pgi ) on bottles , prices x l counts ( should be at least  8/9 $ x l ) . 
  the color is also a feature , should be a bright brilliant green ( even if some kind of oils are opaque ) . 
  in the selection i see bertolli ( made by the same company of carbonell ) , monini , same products you can find in italy 's supermarket . 
  i 'll try monini and coricelli . 
  they ca n't speak proper italian , always mess up verbs ... fondue/raclette and the other dish with meat , do n't remember the name ... 
  i 'd say both, 
  the link you posted seems a little bit biased , so makes me very hard to believe , i ca n't find how they calculated this ranking ... and i would like to know which are the differences between italian laws and other countries laws about this . 
   it has more to due with the fact that lgbt rights in italy are on the level of eastern europe . 
  [ just a quick research ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_italy#/media/file:same-sex_marriage_map_europe_detailed.svg ) the pope himself is really like the queen in uk , the problem are some politicians that used the pope/church/catholicism / christianity try to gain consensus in some parts of voters that are keen to religion . 
  we had something like 40 yrs of government by democrazia cristiana ( the `` dc '' , i think is the same `` party '' of angela merkel , cdu ... but i 'm not sure ... ) that were the people you refer to with `` family day '' , political and cultural issues .

  username checkout ... life gives you lemons if your mom & grandma suck at cooking , `` nomen omen '' spot on in your case ... ... you must be fun at parties ... 
  sorry but i do n't agree , you germans do n't eat things that `` taste of nothing '' , is the opposite for me , you have one big flavour that covers all the others ( comes in mind cinnamon in yours cookies/sweets ) . 
  like , schinken haxe ( pork 's shin , dunno how is written in german ) roasted , from yours pigs , with that burnt crust and the fat below , add one of yours senf ... man , is heaven . 
  and also i tasted once a raw ham from the black forest , again from yours pigs , cured so well that can rightly compete with parma 's or san daniele 's raw and even cerrano ... sausages/wurst , sauerkrauts , mustards/senf , cookies and pastries ... hands down on germany . 
  your `` problem '' imo , is that at one point all taste the same , but is not tasteless , is just that your mouth is `` full '' of that flavour and you should avoid the `` one dish meal '' ( dunno how to translate ) . 
  avoid also wines , your wines are like monster energy , basically sugar , plus , you like rosati wine ... not red , not white ... edit : sry broken angrish, 
   we all know it 's italian ... well ... as an italian , i can say that our mediterranean cuisine is superior than france , but if we move a little north , france is superior ; about breads is a head to head , same for cheese and cured meats/coldcuts ; wines hands down on france 's `` big reds '' and also not-so - `` important '' red wines , about `` everyday '' whites , italy is better imo ... and . . well ... they have oysters ... 
  ofc that green is lightyears far from what pesto is ... also another thing that i notice in a lot of recipes is the oil , like , is transparent , pale , i doubt that is even olive oil sometimes ... oh , / r/food ... 
  i already have a discussion with a guy from that sub ... people are weird ... p.s your recipe for pesto is approved , 
  what 's wrong with you !!!!, 
  ketchup on pasta/pizza , why !!!!???? ... 
  why you make cry all the mamme and nonne of italy ? 
  why !!?? 
  why ca n't you take a pan , half onion , some ev oil , sizzle the onion , put in some good ( canned ) peeled tomatoes , pinch of salt and slow cook for 15 mins ??? 
  you can even add some bacon in cubes if you want , is allowed , mamma e nonna will be happy , they never cry again , they 'll be proud of you !!!, 
  did . . did . . ** did they just made a paella with pesto ?? 
  i read once this `` germans like italians , but do n't respect them , italians do n't like germans , but respect them '', 
  belgium and luxembourg too ... 
  nah ... let them talk and save the graph , after show them , take pics of their faces ... 
  fair point , it 's true , a good % of italians are `` self-shittalkers '' , but another good % simply do n't like to brag about where they are born or how `` cool '' is the country ... 
  well , not only uk , we get more pissed when a ger tell us . 
  point of view about the rightness of intervention ... the aftermath is that now italy and the rest of eu do not have anyone there to talk with ... 
  yes , compared to libya , tunisia after starting the `` arab spring '' has been always more `` tranquil '' than libya ; the last one , after gheddafi gone still caos ; 10 + yrs ago berlusconi ( it sounds a non-sense yea and i never been a big fan of him ) dealt with gheddafi and the immigration from libya was n't so strong like in the last years . 
  gheddafi ofc was not a nice person , but at least we had someone to talk about in libya . 
  my 2 cents . 
  well , before 2015 the entire region of n. africa was more stable ... ( at least libya and tunisia ),

  `` ohy , sailors , get in the water '' in veneto dialect ... 
  he could move a little and try to hang to the buoy , but he did n't ; the real question is , why he , in the first place , jumped in the water in the middle of canal grande in january ? 
  [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/quvwceyck3i ) another source , with some audio . 
  the title is misleading , people were n't laughting at him , nor the crowd shouting at him some `` racist remark '' . 
  and , last , the boat 's crew thrown 4 life buoy at him , and he on purpouse did n't catch it . 
  why no ones jumped in the water to catch him ? 
  well , as far as i experimented , jumping in cold water literally `` freeze '' all your body at the point that you ca n't move and hardly you can even breath . 
  you can hear at some point that after the crowd continuosly shout `` throw the life buoy '' ( `` butta il salvagente '' ) and shout him to grab it , some people , i guess exasperated for the situation , says something that could be related to racism ( a female voice says `` if you keep swimming you 'll reach home back '' and `` he wants to drown , leave him '' ) but is more due the fact that he let himself drown than try to grab the life buoy . 
  no ones in the video support or enjoy the situation because he was an immigrant , is the opposite , at some point people were like `` well , fuck it , i 'm done with this , he does n't want to be saved '' .

  ok , so , risotto al radicchio & fonduta di asiago : - 300 gr [ riso vialone nano ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vialone_nano ) - 2 head of [ radicchio rosso di treviso ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/radicchio_rosso_di_treviso ) - 1 blonde onion ( small ) - vegetable [ broth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/broth ) or standard broth ( aka bouillon cubes ) - white or red wine ( 2 deciliter ) - pancetta affumicata ( in cubes ) or bacon - grana padano - 200gr [ asiago ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asiago_cheese ) - 200 ml milk - 50gr butter wash and clean the radicchio , cut it in thin stripes ( remove the root , use only the white/red `` fleshy '' parts ) and dry it a little . 
  chop up/mince the onion and sweat it in a pan with butter , add the cutted radicchio ( not all , save some ) . 
  add rice ( same pan of the onion + radicchio ) toast it for 1 min , after blur with wine ( make sure the wine `` evaporates '' leaving only the aroma ) and cook the rice adding boiling broth ( it will takes like 15/20 mins ) .
