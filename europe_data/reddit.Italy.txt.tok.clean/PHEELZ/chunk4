  meanwhile : separate pan ; brown the pancetta/bacon with the radicchio left , add 3-4 spoons of broth , stew for 2-3 mins after , off the fire . 
  fonduta di asiago ( simplified method ) : in a pot , cut the cheese in cubes , put it in [ bain-marie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bain-marie ) let it melt , add milk , stir from time to time , leave it `` soft '' . 
  rice is cooked , take it off the fire , add butter , pancetta , grana , and `` manteca '' the rice ( ca n't find the exact term in english . . also this is the difference between butter and oil in rice , `` mantecatura '' ) , adjust salt & pepper , let it rest . 
  serve the rice , moist the plates with asiago fonduta . 
  is not as complicated as it seems , and , for the [ fonduta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fondue ) i made a simple one , or you 'll need also corn starch . 
  if you have questions , just tell me ... p.s the link are meant for the ingredients that i usually found where i live , to give you and `` idea '' of what you need . 
  if you find good replaces and or stuff that you like the most ... no problem . 
  10 found alive and saved ... 
  do you like italian chicory , cheese and pancetta ? 
  the oil/butter swap is not heathen ... 
  ... fair enough , but , i see here some ppl with garlic in the carbonara ... 
  ... the cream of his tiramis\u00f9 ... no eggs ?? 
  only mascarpone with some vanilla , sugar and marsala ? 
  just put all in the blender bowl , so why not put also the fingerlady , chocolate chips and mix all together and drink it like a shake ? 
  i ca n't find his carbonara recipe , but i just watched his tiramis\u00f9 ... 
  if there is a god , please have mercy of akis ... carbonara original recipe do not need cream . 
  same for italy, 
  it happened in italy 1 yr ago , it was `` legal '' for medical use , but `` bedrocan '' prices were up like 600 $ / 2000 $ for a 3 months therapy . 
  law changed last year and now you can get `` medical '' use marijuana for like 10/15 $ per grams , thanks to the national healthcare system , plus national plantations . 
  here , or you are terminally ill , or you have to find a doctor that orders you weed . 
  do n't tell me ... :(, 
  seeing your flair , also in italy prescripted marijuana is legal . 
  ... but ... but ... is very yummi ! ... just , close your eyes ... 
  chorizo ! ... yes !, 
  we call it `` salame piccante '' ... and , dear pt friends , how i ca n't mention baccal\u00e0 ... when someone gon na ask me when i feel european , the answer will be `` everytime i seat at the table '' :d, 
  the maggots are also inside the cheese ... so , yes , you eat some maggots ... 
  as i see on the map , i 'm surprised too , also for italians , we too have ( except the cheese ) pig feet , ears and noses , also veil 's fried brain , trippa ( tripe ) , livers ... 
  but i get the `` wet rice '' recipe , we have a thing like [ this ] ( https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcs6fox41btuapmpafjthd1xemnzpazrqckneywgl1iycolwfnrf ), 
  meanwhile ... on the pre-alps sun is shining and no snow/rain ... wtf ... 
  nah , is all about not wasting food as you said in the previous comment , and why spent money on pet 's food ? 
  if you want to use poultry innards for you , check [ this ] ( http://www.kung-food.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/minestra-di-fegatini-3.jpg ) ... is called `` dirty broth '' ... 
  if you have a pet , boil the innards , cut them thin , your dog/cat will appreciate ... 
  the fun part of eating casu marzu is when the maggots start spreading on the table ... 
  cause i never taste it ... and never heard it ... gon na check your link  edit : now i get it , is like a `` soup '' with meat too ... i thought was like plain rice + blood ... looks good btw ... 
  i do n't see any horror here ... maybe , but maybe , portugal ... 
  lombardia already done ? 
  where in spain ? 
  ahhh !, 
  ! ... the good ol' days !, 
  in current italian `` baita '' could be `` lodge '' or `` cabin '' ( for italians a `` baita '' is a house on the mountains ) . 
  in brescian dialect the term `` baita '' means `` home '' . 
  not sure which are the differences in english between lodge/cabin and cottage in detail . 
  ( maybe lodge is bigger than a cabin , maybe one is made with wood only , another one is made with stones ... and so on ? ), 
  if you are italian , you ca n't love alpini , where i live we have the `` monte suello '' branch , that is made by 57 groups from the surroundings valleys ( reading rigoni stern in the article , when he wrote `` the sergeant in the snow '' he was on duty in the vestone battalion , one of the groups of monte suello , that 's why `` gh\u00e8 r\u00ecarom a baita ? '', 
  in brescian dialect ... ) . 
  today , the alpini here in town , oversee a little chapel on a hill , with a small shack closeby , with porch and a fireplace , a grill , benches and tables , in the middle of woods . 
  and it 's free for all , you have only to talk with a `` vecio '' , ask him the keys and tell them when you planned to go and make a bbq , they sure give you free access to the shack , let you use the fireplace , closet and water , basically a free `` baita '' . 
  so , when you see someone with this [ hat ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/cappello_alpino.jpg ) , stand up !, 
  lol , / u/occidetalism is right , why do n't you just admit that you were wrong about `` european police '' ... ? 
  cheeky germans ... 
  slavery pls yes ... and , if you can , the correlation between masters/slaves/society ... i think could be interesting ( i do n't know your studie 's background ) to see how worked back then ... btw , great posts op , `` lavoro eccezionale , complimenti '' ... keep them coming !, 
  and there is also a little enclave that speaks occitan ... 
  a legend says that their dialect ( if spoken fast enought ) resemble english and so , they can also understand english w/o even studing it ... maybe in the past few yrs , pugliesi can also be labeled as `` potheads '' because they are pushing for medical/ricreational weed legalisation . 
  jokes aside , they are pretty cool guys . 
  as an italian , i approve this map , good job op !, 
  well ... it was the [ 1996 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denny_m%c3%a9ndez ) ... 
  your nickname though ... , 
  is `` sechko '' mean dry ? ... and how do you spell it ? ... just curious ... 
  ye , i 'm surprised too ... if you look at n italy , they even put venetian name of the month ... sardo and corso too !, 
  as an italian , i 'm amazed that the map shows different names in dialects ... same for fr and sp ... 
  [ 4x4 or gtfo ] ( http://pandansa.p.a.pic.centerblog.net/4enacaeg.jpg ), 
  iceland = nice football players ... ??? 
  i do n't even ... 
   aelia scupi aelia should refer to a specific `` gens '' in ancient rome ( is like a last name ) , about scupi , probably there was a river or a mountain and they named after it ... 
  damn , just find him now on yt ... if he is italian , his english if too good ... btw , nice post about rome ... keep the good job up !, 
  are you drunk ? ... 
  you ... i like you ... 
  seems clear to me ... no surprises in this charts ... 
  same for italy , tunisia did n't sent the papers for having him back in years , even if he was sentenced to jail ... we can not hold people in jail forever , but , and this is what the article is about , at least we can try to track and have a special eye on some of those problematic individuals , that seems where the italians are good at . 
  proof is that , lucky or not , during a simple id check 2 standard policemen caught a terrorist . 
  this same issue could be pointed to germany , as you said , if the guy was bad news in italy , why germany let him in ? 
  and after , why he was n't watched 24/7 in germany ? 
  italy can not kept him in jail , but at least got convicted , and could n't send him back in tunisia cause tunisia simply does n't want him back , in fact the papers for deportation order came after like 2 days after the attack in berlin . 
  so why after all this the ger authorities did n't sent him back straight to tunisia ? 
  me too :d, 
  oh ... ye ... now i can see the whole post 's exchange , and , yes misunderstood ... really sorry dude ... my bad ... :( ... and ... as / u/spaghialpomodoro said is pretty accurate ... 
  so do you think that because there has been a mafia problems in s italy , the police are trained/used to pull out a gun and shoot so easily ? ... if is yes ... well ... sorry to disappoint you ... 
  i 'd prefer have more and more policemen like the two guys caught amri ... 
  the question is , since he was already convicted in italy and spent 4yrs in jail in italy , how did he get in germany ? 
  you got it right ... what you said is the real concern ... 
  brindisi 's school is not a terrorist attack dude ... what are you talking about ? 
  5 - how the ger police did n't look up for him after knowing he spent 4 yrs in jail in italy for setting fire to immigrants centre and got an expulsion order from italy 's magistrature ? 
  sui/fr borders = / = sui/ita borders, 
  tbh ... no , they are n't used to shoot , it police are not so `` happy trigger '' ... 
  mmhmm . . well , what you linked is not properly the standard checkpoint between sui and it , the picture is probably aut / slo border , checkpoints we have with sui looks like [ this ] ( http://www.corrieredicomo.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/brogeda-1.jpg ) , and this is one of the smallest ( ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/dogana_ch_oria_valsolda_-_gandria_ ( versante_ch ) . jpg ) ) and sure if you try to cross them by feet they gon na stop you and ask id at last ... 
  they corrected the article , no call at the police for gunshot , just a normal check ... 
  `` offre la casa '' is better ... 
  i think that are quite the same , but i did n't know that in portugal also have this kind of meat ... wondering if the pt one tastes savoury or more sweet ... 
  thank you, 
  and , a lot of eu cultures were influenced by ancient romans ... and they did the same at the time , constatly integrate ... so , you get the point right ... 
  i dunno why people are afraid about cultural change ... 
  i just said that the article sums up the point of view of some italians , not all italians ... and p.s. . . 
  i did n't downvoted you ... 
  ok , i mean , his first comment ... 
  ok , now i get it , yes in 2014 after an inquiry emerged this kind of relations , specially between ngos and goverment aid , cg have a little spot in this , the money they get are compensation for the work . 
  what i 'm trying to say that cg are not big actors in this , the great of the money goes to the ngos ( search buzzi mafia capitale , was the name of the inquiry ), 
  sry , i do n't get it , cg gets money from migrants when they rescue them , or they gets money from government/ngos after they had rescued them ? 
  am i right if i say `` barolo ... barolo everywhere '' ? 
  when italy tried to do a similar thing , every other countries ( eu and international ) went batshit crazy saying that we were collaborating with terrorists ... p.s. 
  i dunno why your main comment has been down voted ...
