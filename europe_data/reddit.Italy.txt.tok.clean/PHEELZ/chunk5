  this is [ one ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/10/13/news/migranti_falsi_miti_bonino-149688642/ ) but is in italian . 
  they gets paid an amount for doing their job , if people works and use machines , you have to pay them . 
  the problem that you refer to , is not about the coast guard , instead , is about the organizations that take cares of immigrants after they are unloaded in italy . 
  they get paid 35 $ for each immigrant they ( are supposed to ) take care . 
  the article is pretty on point , is a good read , it sums up some italian 's point of view about emigration . 
  italy already tried to apply an `` australian solution '' back in the early 2000 's , as the article says too , with maroni , even trying to deal with n african countries some policies to contain the emigration , and has been criticized internationally for this . 
  the problem had been not generated in 2013 with mare nostrum , mare mostrum was quite good , having our ships just outside the lybian territorial waters acted as deterrent in some cases , the problem has increased when all the other navy ships from all others eu countries + ngo 's ones pick up migrants and unload them in italy . 
  that is the actual scenario , so , why the numerous countries involved in this operation do not reallocate those ones in their own country ? 
  they could ask more money from eu to sustain this afford , setting up flights and routes and reallocate immigrants in others eu countries . 
  sry for grammar mistakes . 
   the roman empire were an actual ~ ~ country ~ ~ empire ... 
   or dumb enough to get caught the radio between get caught/pass in sicily ... oh , well ...

  `` nederlands scheepvaartmuseum '' ... was really good ... 
  ye , regions here have several `` admin 's '' powers ... like , they can hang out taxes too , on a `` regional '' ( regions = lombardy , piedmont , lazio , campania ) level 's ... 
  seems de has one more level after regions , like you said , nuts-1 ... 
  jeez . . hold on ... i need someone to eli5 me ... while i google some stuffs ... 
  ty for the explanation , so , if i have to trace a parallel with where i live , they are like `` regions '' for us italians ... ? 
   also in different states in germany do you mean `` regions '' in germany ? 
  i mean , eli5 , are de `` zones '' `` regions '' counted as `` states '' ( like , independent , can do a secession by their own ? ... ), 
  i know for experience about the differencies between some de `` regions '' ( like , fines for bad behaviours ... ) , would like to know more about `` differencies '' as de `` states '' ...

   30-year-old canadian tourist from quebec had to post $ 170 bail for performing the salute for a picture ok , but , why 170 $ for canadians ,  the tourists , who were released after posting a total of $ 1,200 in bail set by a local judge while 1200 $ for chinese ?

  wait , so , if you are a french ( nvm if m or f ) you have a `` high rate of marital acceptance '' is like , basically , my wife or husband can fuck anybody and neither me or him feel guilty or at least `` is ok '' ? ... 
  like , france tolerate to be cuckold , so franze is ze most cuckold country in ze world ? ... 
  am i get this right ? 
  i 'm sorry , never get theirs `` humor '' ... ofc is too complicated for me , so , sorry , but i 'll never get the sketch ... 
  but ... 
  i like birds at the end , so , [ i 'll leave with this , thank you very much ... ] ( https://youtu.be/sfm-9linmrm?t=38s ), 
  ok , now calm down relax , breathe , i was joking too ... 
  i mean , like , go to nespoli 's twitter and ask him to sport/say something about poland and space , i 'm serious now , like get him saying in polish `` poland can into space '' ... 
  i mean , will be fabulous ... think about for a sec ... p.s : i do n't remember the mission , but he was photography director when he was on iss , they made a doc about his mission ... so ... worth trying imho ... 
  tbh , is not a rivalry ... is a joke ... * poland can not into space is a running gag in the polandball series that is based in polandball 's attempts to venture into space . 
  polandball 's attempts always end in some sort of mishap preventing the desired goal of heading into space from happening . 
  he got to and landed on space once , but fell back to earth . 
  it serves as a standard and classic way for countries to make fun of polandball , one of the meme 's most core principles . 
  it has been elaborated on to extremities , has seen countless puns made based on it , and - in an event that astonished much of polandball 's followers , and cemented its popularity - is even an achievement in the video games `` europa universalis iv '' , `` sid meier 's civilization v : brave new world '' and `` hearts of iron iv *, 
  yo , / u/fluchtpunkt , do n't you know the polandball/meme about pl space program ? 
  ye , is hard to be italian on iss ... but , at least , we took real coffee in space ...

  astro paolo * ... sounds like a chocolate bar , but is an engineer , welp , this is an [ overview ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paolo_nespoli ) . 
  welp , if they means `` at the stadium '' ; i guess they had before or after the game , some sandwich with `` salamina '' ( i know , is a xbreed from salamella and salsiccia , so everyone from n to s are happy ... ) tbh , when i went to the stadio , years and years ago , i took some `` panini '' ( with `` cold cuts '' ) from home , never eaten at the `` vans '' outside the stadium ( too expensive ... even if ... some of them got real deals ... ) btw , i though it was a `` typical '' home-watching game , so i went for home-made foods ... stills , at home , 66cl beers rules ... 
  no `` gib '' ... the word is `` split '' ... , 
  thank you , / u/voidguaranteed ... ( i mean , i would like to know what is about too ... ), 
   italy : `` the most famous terrace food is a sandwich with ` salamella ' ( or ` salsiccia ' -- depending whether you are in milan or rome ) a grilled sausage , often with onions and paprika , '' according to uefa.com 's paolo menicucci . 
  utterly bs , nice try paolo menicucci ... [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/mocwglrlhg8 ) a very good example , he eats [ `` frittata '' with onions ] ( http://ricettediognitipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/frittata-cipolle.gif ) and a large [ beer ] ( http://www.spesati.com/5020-tm_thickbox_default/birra-peroni-66-cl.jpg ) , or , in case , [ this ] ( http://www.drindrin.it/media/birra-moretti-66-cl-spesa-online_0000026103.jpg ) ... edit : carbonara or spaghetti al pomodoro is a classic too ... 
  o'reilly ? 
  ofc pauly ... the 3 times pole astronaut ... do not forget chrystoforettinsky , first female from poland that can into space ... 
  although after the '78 ... 
   the guy is italian . 
  may i introduce you major ~ ~ paolo nespoli ~ ~ [ @astro_paolo ] ( https://twitter.com/astro_paolo?ref_src=twsrc%5egoogle%7ctwcamp%5eserp%7ctwgr%5eauthor ) ? 
   is this a joke ? 
  is this a reference i am not getting ? 
  no , is real ... 
  he is pauly nespolinsky ... a naturalized pole from italy ... like , you know , the grandma was from poland , the grandpa was from italy ... is a long story ... / s, 
  i 'm sorry , but i still do n't get it . . ( keep in mind i 'm a slowpoke ... ), 
   for a country being that critical of the eu as a whole , it 's still hypocritical to boast about it . 
  ... which country do you refer to ? 
  yo , forerunner of humanitarian assistance , could you also `` run '' to s italy ? 
  i heard there are some asylum seekers there who need `` assistance '' ... 
  brevik will be maybe free in 21yrs even if  in norway , you commit the biggest terrorist attack after ww2 and you stay in a comfortable prison for life ...  in italy , you get to go home after 26 years are n't the systems both fantastic ? 
  but , after mere 6 yrs in a norwegian 's prison , a mass murderer says that `` his human rights '' are violated ... again , too much a stretch for me ... 
  yep , i 'm aware that he 'll never go out , and i agree ( already post to others , pls ... i 'm tired to repeat ... no offence ... ) about the whole norwegian 's system , stays that , for me , after only , 6 yrs ( ? ), 
  he asked for more `` commodities '' even in a `` perfect '' system ... i mean , nor 's criminals are lucky ( even if they are very few ... ), 
   it 's easy to do what ? 
  why can 5 million people manage a prison system in that way while 60 millions ca n't ? 
  r/shititalianssay ... or are you even trying to compare our system to the norwegians one ? 
  aka , our prison 's system is the same of the nor 's one ? 
  so , should be easy for us , even if we are 60m , `` hey , azraelcrusader , look !, 
  in norway if you kill 70 + ppl or robs a bank , you go in [ prison ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=breivik+prison&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjxxu-6spzvahvebhqkhvzpbvyq_auicygc&amp;biw=1215&amp;bih=813&amp;dpr=2.5#safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=norways+prison ) !!!, 
  . . and , guess what , you can even ask for online gaming !!!!, 
  now multiply this for 60m and the crime rate of italy ... auguri . 
  p.s : so , we should get rid of the 41bis ? 
  and this is beautyfull !!! ... 
  no jks ... but , i 'm not here to analyze the whole norwegian 's prisons system , ok ? 
  i 'm talking about a single case ... 
   if your own life is limited to sitting in your room all day playing games and browsing reddit then norwegian prison might be an upgrade . 
  exactly , but i least , i did n't killed 70 ppl ... so , i can go out , do something , meet friends ... for a murderer , even ...  limited to sitting in your room all day playing games and browsing reddit then norwegian prison might be an upgrade . 
  is too much , imho , and he asked for more , even if the norway 's prisons system is top noch ( just google it ) ... again , is a stretch for me ( i 'm not pro-death row or shit like that ... to be clear ... ), 
   when people get out of the us prison system , do you think they are less likely or more likely to commit more crimes ? 
  i do n't argue about this ... since i do n't know the us ( as i 'm not living in ) and he asked me `` what i think about '' ... i do n't think nothing about us prison 's system ... again , i 'm not a us citizen and i 've never had nothing to do with us ' prisons ... 
  but i can argue about a person , that killed 70 + ppl , and asks about internet and a playstation ... can i , / u/pm _ me_your_bdaycake ? 
  and btw , why you argue with me about this ? 
  neither you live in nor ( given your flair ) , so , politely speaking , da faq u want ? 
  p.s : no bad feelings , ofc ... 
  i already apologize for my bad semantics ... sry again ... 
   the netherlands is closing down prisons because it does n't have enough prisoners . 
  17m ... nice for them ...  outside of japan , which is culturally very different than most european countries .
