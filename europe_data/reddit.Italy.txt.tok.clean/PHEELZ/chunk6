   norway is n't the only example of this . 
  again , i was not talking about % , but about a guy ( that happen to be nor , that killed alone 70 + ppl ) and asked for internet/console gaming in a state ( norway ) where the prisons are well know to be very very `` comfortable '' ... and , this , w/o japan , nl and % 's , imho , sounds funny ... hope my semantic is clear ... 
  i do n't know , should we ? 
  i do n't get it dude ... like , really ... 
  i was talking about `` higher standards '' in relation of prison 's system , not average `` murders '' statistics ... 
  thought it was clear ... 
  welp , bastoy 's ( iirc ) prison has plenty of free space ... and even ponies to breed ( again , iirc ) ... so `` physically '' you have your `` room/mini-apartment + space + pets ... ... oh , and a ps4 , ` cuz ... after you killed 70 ppl for whatever reason , `` human rights '' to play online , is too much a stretch for me ... 
  i 'm not living in the u.s. . . sorry ... so , i ca n't argue about it ... p.s : i think in some us states , for a 70 + murder will be death row ... afair , or at least , no ps4 ... 
   he can complain as much as he wants about anything he wants . 
  does n't mean he 'll get it . 
  yeah , i know , but , for a guy that killed 70 + ppl , complaining for a gaming console ( as `` human rights violation '' ) , for me , sounds real real funny ... 
   you have never been truly alone in life then . 
  misanthropes , given what brevik did , well , seems to me a lot misanthrope , so ...  why it is so difficult to grasp the concept that to take away someone 's freedom of movement . 
  again , was/is he a globethrotter ? 
  he complained do not have `` a gaming console '' like a human 's right violantion ... 
  i 'm a simple man , but the one 's complains to not have a `` gaming '' console do not seems a keen one to tour around the world ...  basically taking away someone 's life but without the organs stopping of course . 
  death row is a fact in norway ? ... btw your 's last one , it makes no sense , for me ... 
  yep , but  `` i 'm sure he complains about a lot of things . '', 
  afair , he complained about a playstation ... in jail ... i mean ... given the [ nor 's jails ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35813470 ) ... what 's the `` purpose , aim , goal , objective '' to be in jail ? 
  even if you killed , like 70 ppl ? 
  sounds weird to me ... 
   maria franca fissolo `` shit '' ... lady kinder surprise ... fml ... 
   not being detained . 
  do you mean physically ? 
  air ? 
   my freedom what is `` freedom '' for you ? 
   a cell is in your mind . 
  i disagree ... 
  i got it now ... anti-suicide search ? 
   for example daily naked strip searches . 
  like , he could watch freely x hrs of strippers/livecams girls or pr0n sites ? 
  `` searching '' the internet ... cuz he has a right to fap ? 
  first : sorry for my broken angrish ... my semantic 's , well ... is fucked up , thank you for the efford ... really ... second : thank you , for a `` fair '' point of view on the web , w/o stereotypes/bullshitting on a good/fancy subject ... i 'm not joking ... again take my words with a pinch of `` salt '' ( no negative ofc , just ... elaborate ... ) third : `` i do n't know , i 'm not the expert . '', 
  same as i. . . 
  i 'd sound `` loud '' in my post , but again , i lack on semantics , my fault ( language barrier ) , hope you get my content right ( you see to ... imho ) ...  ending his life as a free person is good enough for me . 
  as for me , but hearing him with no internet access and stuff as `` violations ' of human rights '' ... welp , i urge to draw a line on the sand ... ( again , is a metaphor ... ) p.s : thank you for the convo ... 
   he certainly is n't the only prisoner who has video game access . 
  so , if we kill 70 ppl in norway , do we still get `` toys '' ... it will be a console or a fleshlight ( sexual toy ) are we allowed to keep it even if we kill 70 ppl ? 
  no no no , no torture dude ... da fuck ... no revenge pr0n or whatever ... you are out of the path ... like , really out ... 
  i agree about prison 's reform of the person 's and so on ... 
  but , tbh , no gaming ( or at least no claim bout human 's rights cuz you have no internet or online gaming ) like ... as i said , if you kill 70 ppl with an ar 15 , do you want fries with that ? 
  ( or a console , in this case ... c'mon ... ) ... 
   well , he likes gaming i like fucking females ... 
  so , if i kill 70 + ppl , in norway , they allow me to fuck some girls in jail cuz , `` well , he likes ~ ~ gaming ~ ~ fucking girls '' ... you serious ? 
  after all my post , and seeing how inmates ' , like brevik , are threatening in nor jails ' , would you disagree ? 
  be honest ... 
  welp , norway 's penitentiaries seems not so bad , at least , you have a console and a nice view ... still a cell , but you can go out with no fence on outlook ... plus , someone provide you food ... 
   ( possible heavily restricted ) but afair he said no consoles , human rights ' violation ...  he 's only allowed to talk to professionals ... well ... he killed 70 ppl unarmed ppl ... would you , / u/helm , gon na talk with him in `` fancy '' weekly meet , maybe you can exchange with him some `` smoked salmon '' recipes , would ya ? 
   his life is over . 
  he complained about not having a console , dude ... wtf ? 
  norway is also a 5,267,146 nation ... 5m ... milano + roma , metro area , is like 7.5 m. . . it 's easy when you are few ... stays the fact that a guy that killed 70 ppl ( iirc with a rifle like ar 15 , plus ammo , ofc ... the ratio is like 1/70 ... ) even if theirs `` higher standard '' ... got a console to play with it , for next x yrs , plus time to go outside ... and so on ... just google norways prison ... 
  i mean , i 'm italian , we had and have a lot of mafia 's `` boss '' ... but , 41 bis ( stricht `` jail '' for you ) do not allow ps ... maybe , at least , after x yrs , if you are older , maybe the tv ... btw , i dont ' get the `` norway just has higher standards in general so it reflects in the prison system . '', 
  so , italian , french , canadians , tahilands , japanese , us , chileans criminals should move to norway cuz `` higher standards '' ... da fuq mate ? 
  i know ... but some ppl do not understand the `` limes '' ( border ) between latin and greek ; if i could master greek , prolly i could go `` easily '' to a lot of ee languages ( the `` border '' will be russian , but atm , i 'll have to start learning a new alphabet ... seeing your 's flair , greeks ' one , at least ... ) at a `` worldwide '' level , knowing `` basic latin '' , or `` basic greek '' ... gon na make you learn italian ( 85 % ) , spanish ( 85 % ) french ( i say 70 % ) english ( 80 % ) german ( 70 % ) and so on on romance laguages , ... all out of the pronunciation from dialects ... these goes if you get 5 yrs high-school latin ... 
  if you studied greek ( at least in italy ) in the high school , again 5 yrs of these stuff , if you are skilled , maybe you can get standard greek , and a lot of some ee languages ( at least the written words ... ) ... it 's a long path ...  you put spanish and italian in the same basket we are in the `` same basket '' , and even some frenchs , leave it alone some romanias , gave 3 mins on a beer `` night '' with a spanish , a french and an italian and a romanian , we `` naturally '' hook up on language ... germans hook up to ... put an english in , and we start to have problems ( letters are not `` spells '' as written ... dunno if i get the `` core '' ) ... little for a german , the more we go east , the more the `` letters '' change ... but maybe not the `` structure of the phrase '' ... ( and here we go to the greeks ) ... is a long path man ... 
  i saw a documentary about nor 's jail , they even get out on a park w/o fences ... so , given them x hrs to go outside , is like a uni student that goes outside between `` lessons '' ... given the student `` x hrs to go outside within the `` lessons '' ... is this `` jail '' for norway ? 
   he 's never ever getting out . 
  but he gets a fair good treatment while in `` jail '' ... so , what the point to be in `` jail '' ?? 
   maria franca fissolo in ferrero / u/ankokudaishogun jesus !, 
  i 'd went for emma marcegaglia tbh ... no idea , maffioso ? 
  / u/sjoerd920 hush , my baby ... every kinder 's eggs around the world came from her , we exchange `` maffiosi '' ( p.s : your spell is wrong ... ) for hoes and ganja ... from nl ... ( no tulips , pls ... :d ), 
  a.k.a ? 
  tha fuck is she for italy ??? 
  tbh , i do n't know , and i do n't care , stays he killed 77 ( if i 'm right ) people cold-handed ( excuse my angrish ) ... 
  in my country , maybe after a 8/10 yrs trial , at least he was getting 20/25 yrs without consoles or whatever ... not strict jail ... but ... if he asked a console for violating `` human rights '' ... well ... c'mon brevik ... 
  yeah you right , still the fact that norway 's state feed me for playing videogames , even after i killed 77 ppl ... you could fix 1000 mod 's compatibilities , for free , and ctd 's , but ... 
  i 'm still winning ... they nourish me ... fucking out of my mind tbh . 
  dunno mate , like ... wtf ... like , what about me , breaching yours ' door house , and said : / u/relnor !!!!, 
  you just cold-blooded 77 ppl , or , you just downloaded 79gb of pr0n !!, 
  surrend or i 'll get you in a room with a ps4 + free time outside in the beautiful norwegians landscape , for like ... 6 yrs ? 
  oh , in the meantime . 
  you can get a college degree ... you filthy mofo !!!!, 
  some vikings are strange ... like , hc strange ... :d, 
  yep ... but , at least ... 
  nor 's state feed you ... man , horizon zero dawn for ps is not so bad ... ( i 'm a pc player btw ) ... think about it, 
  hold , my northern-north ( friend ) ... like , for a subject like him , the treatment is too `` light '' ? 
  we are on the same path about the `` idea '' behind ... a middle ( ~ ~ hard ~ ~ harsh way for people like him ) could be ( given rehabilitative factor ) more enforced ? 
  yours tl : dr seems good , a guy spotted a bug , reported to the company ( proof he exploided it ) , the company said `` hurr durr h4ck3r !! 111 ! '' . 
  ofc i 'm not in hungary , but , if they fail , spread the word , with another title ... btw , ty :d, 
   guy has full upkeep and warcraft iii iirc , that 's the life of a happy 12-year old but he is older than me i guess !!!, 
  ( like 40yrs old !!! ), 
  i mean , he 's kept in a room , with ps4 or whatever , free walking in a park ( as i saw in a documentary ) for like x hrs per day ( no fences on sights ... ) , man ... plus , feeded ( ok , like , prison 's food ) but ... if this is the treatment for killer in norway ... p.s : hold the meta , i see yours flair ... but ... think about it , maybe he can even get a sauna ... for free :d, 
   did n't breivik complain about not getting a playstation 4 or something and claimed it was a human rights abuse ? 
  how can i buy 6l of ouzo or whatever you what , m8 ? 
  pm me if you want to go to norway ... ;d, 
  well ... ofc yes , plus , playstation and , as i saw , a lot of free-time , open-nature-time ... seems that norways ' jails are good ... just google ... ( no jk ) p.s : welp , if you are in jail , you have a lot of time , so , education comes if you `` invest '' that time ... still , if i had my own cell + ps + free park in a jail ... given they feed me and let me study ... make the math ... 
   norwegian 's jails  greeks unis ... well ... 
  could you speak `` potable '' at least , or a tl ; dr. . . ?? 
  just saying ... 
  did you check the nor 's jails standard ? 
  did he still have playstation 4 in the norwegian 's prison ? ... 
  just curious ...
