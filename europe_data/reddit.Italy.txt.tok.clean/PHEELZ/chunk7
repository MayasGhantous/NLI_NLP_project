  are you sure ? ... 
  it 's a 500 !!, 
  do i have to take for granted that everybody in mississippi owns a house ( or at least two or three ? ), 
   myself have italian citizenship and passport so it 's easy ... 
   it looks a bit more like zuidoost or something afar , maybe noord . 
  this ^ ... prolly op was wandering around :d ... again , i saw `` little bikes frames '' stripped in centrum ( and if the bikes were stripped , they were locked like from , at least 6 months , aka , ~ ~ worst ~ ~ is ok to stripping imho ... in centrum ... ) and never saw a moped stripped ... edit : a word ... 
   and veneto has always been traditionally a papist region , birthplace of many popes [ `` meh '' ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/lista_dei_papi#xix_secolo ) ... should we put lombardia too ? 
   century and stronghold of the dc for decades . 
  well ... lega nord , but again , n italy is not so `` bounded '' with the `` secular pope '' or catholicism , and , even if , is only for policals pupouses ... ( elections )  anyway these maps and definitions are more like a way to represent stereotypes than a serious scientific rapresentation of society . 
  ... true ... 
   how could you see anything with that bobble hat on ? 
  dunno man , i mean , if op posted a bike 's frame ripped from ams , i 'll be like `` yeah , ok , whateva , been back and forth from ams since 2001 , is ordinary stuff 's ( due the fact of the huge amount of bikes ... ) '' but , an entire ripped scooter/moped ... jeee , are you guys going too far ? 
  / s btw , i ( kinda ) know ams ( centrum and not ... ) in the last yrs , you get too many scooters ... ( but less cars ... ), 
  but , i can testify that in amsterdam i saw at least ( in a span of 10 days in the centrum ... < 3 yrs ago , since 2001 ... ) a lot of bike 's frame stripped to the bone ... 
   in catholic societies and especially italy we never really had a strong relationship with the bible . 
  this is right , as fair as i experienced ...  in the south , catholic customs are often mixed with old pagan traditions but the power of the church has always been strong . 
  in the last yrs ( like 20 ) in s italy , maybe , the church 's would be strong , but i 'm not sure , i would like to know how many ppls attends sunday mass and stuff . . ( leave it alone the votes on elections , ofc ... ) all the other things , maybe are only folklore ( again , leave alone powerplays for votes ... )  be the whole south and center without tuscany , and another important catholic region is veneto . 
  center , roma/lazio ? 
  i 'm 50/50 on the capital/region , tuscany ? 
  historically `` was '' red , but again , we have to separate `` bible belt '' from `` votes basin '' ... veneto ? 
  meh ( :d ) dunno about this map ... until op 's could shown how the data are collected ... is weird ... edit : a word, 
  well ... 
  i 've been in amsterdam a lot of time , and i saw a lot of bike 's frames stripped `` to the bone '' ... ( locked at bridges ... ) as the nl goings to far ? 
  oh , dude , wait ... if you can , add a small translation !, 
  ah , ok , so we are on the same boat ... this map is `` weird '' imho ... 
   bible belt marker what is/how is calculated ? 
   germany has an average marker of 30 with their bible belt hitting 70 , while italy would have an average of 40 again , what is this means ? 
  just curious about `` bible belt '' that , for me , is a u.s ' thing ... 
  subs ? 
  looking at the map you posted , seems not even italy as a whole ( n/s ) is in the bible belt ... edit : maybe it depends what `` bible belt '' means ? 
  ... like , christians/catholics , % of ppl going to mass on sunday ... stuff like this ... just curious ... 
  i 'm confused , so , italy is out ? 
  ( break a stereotype 's ... ? 
  welp ... 
  iceland ... i 'll leave here a nice couple of american 's tourists in [ firenze ] ( http://corrierefiorentino.corriere.it/methode_image/2017/07/06/fiorentino/foto/oksito-593x443.jpg?v=20170707110027 ) ( i think was around june 2017 ... ),

  you mean that italians are use to be `` shoulders on the wall '' situations ? 
  or reckless missions like in the raid on alexandria ? 
  or even the `` beffa di buccari '' ( bakar raid ) or how italians `` invented '' ( and in some case , trained ) what today is shayet 13 ... as italian , i 'm aware that ( taking out 117 ad and s.p.q.r = aka the cradle of western civilation ... ) we do not shine when it comes to military 's stuff , but , some `` weird '' cases involves `` madlads '' from italy ... what can i say , some italians likes to gamble ... 
  welp , imma semi-serious now , italy , due the morphology , needs wheeled stuffs ( imagine moving tracked vehicle on the appennines ... ) btw , i hope fr and ita keep going on litoral 's ships like fremms , all looks so sexy ... :d,

  so , brown sauce is hp sauce !!!!, 
  i 've been scammed for years here !!!, 
  always thought as `` us bbq sauce , but taste better '' ... but it 's not '' til , ty !, 
  ( i suppose is kinda `` intriguing '' sauce ... gon na try to replicate it with fresh ingrdients ... ) p.s : looked up about the ingredients , if you scots like that taste , prolly would like some moroccan 's cuisine ... btw , ty again !, 
  well ... well ... well ... from this map , seems spain is backfiring about `` siesta/lazyness '' stereotype ... :d, 
  i can assure that we are aware about it ... 
   we are still waiting for our legio ix . 
  atm i ca n't quote the oc post from unhcr 's here ( plz , try to search it ... it was good , on / r/europe ) , a lot were for bangladesh , but on the first 10 countries , 4 or 5 were former fr colonies ... african colonies ... do n't get me wrong , i 'm not here to fight or whatever ; what i try to say is ( and excuse my cranked angrish ... ) is ; fr colonized a big part of afr for a lot of centuries , and now , macron ( that is like , less 10yrs older than me ... ) goes out saying that the same countries , whose been colonized by his nation , are lacking of `` civilization '' , to me , this sounds a little bit `` deceiver '' ( hypocrite ) , so , what in the past centuries fr did in afr ? 
  i 'm aware that some regions in afr are not so `` easy '' ... imho , mons . 
  macron just could simply avoid the comment ...  edit : macron ( that is like , less 10yrs older than me ... )  actually he is 3yrs older than me ... fml ... 
  so , explain why a lot of immigrants on med 's route come from some former french 's colony ? 
  ( there was a post in the past week or 2 here on / r/europe about the % of immigrants landing in italy ... ) or just search `` fran\u00e7afrique '' , or just why fr was one of the leading nations ' in 2011 for libya ? 
  ghana is probably the `` only '' example ... no one here talked about belgian congo ... 
   `` fran\u00e7afrique '' seems monsieur macron has a short memory ... 
   italian medite-bro , let 's go to sleep . 
  i ca n't , cicadas starting now here , i traded friday 's night for a free saturday 's night , 30 mins until now , i 'll start my shift ... 
  yeah , i got it , is kinda similar as `` our '' carabinieri , ours got different `` branches '' , so , is not unsual to see some `` policemen '' ( like yours in the pic ) also in italy ; even for us , a lot of them came from army 's trainings ( i have a couple of friends that switched from army to police 's / carabinieri 's just for better wages ... ) but they still have like , 4/6 yrs of military training ... basically , they are soldiers ... 
  i 've never been to lucerne , but i 've been to zurich , the title is ok , i was just `` cherrypicking '' , 
  do you really want to start an `` explorers of europe '' craze ? 
  are you sure ? 
  here is a [ `` topolino '' ( `` little mouse '' ) cabrio ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/fiat_topolino_cabrio.jpg ) , for us , `` cabrio '' means something like this , happy cake day !,

  so , 2 km , `` open air cable '' in lucerne ( sui ) sounds ok ? 
  ( gave you upvote cuz yours cake day ... ok ? ), 
  go to imgur or 9gag if you want some `` memes '' ... tbh ... edit : some can downvote as they please , but , maybe i 'm a stubborn ones , and i 'm close minded that i ca n't even relate to op 's `` meme '' , still saying salieri is mediocre ... or quoting `` amadues movie '' ...
