   1.2 miles ... `` open air , double decker , cable car ( the cabrio ) '' ... are you even try to be european ???? 
  here is the hints : 1.93 km , `` cabriolet '' ... omfg ... 
  its a matter of % , do n't say my comments make no sense , pls ... learn some biology ( ? ), 
   looking at the pics ... 
  the cat in the pic seems ( to me ) fully grown ( the head at least ) , so imho , could be a female one ( check my oc pic in this thread , i have both male and female manxs , where the female is 3-colours , and , as / u/videocracy expalined , usually , 3 coloured fur are females , in % , even if calico , tabby or `` soriano '' in italian , percentile of 3-colours goes to female kittens ... the one is the pics seems `` smaller '' for an `` eu '' ( in this case greece ... ) cats , means that cat weight + / - 2.3 kgs , means is a female ( mine is a male and even in summer weights at least 4/4 .5 kgs , in winter he is a lazy ass , goes up to 5.5 kgs , neutered/spayed ... ) ... as a farmer , seeing this pics , is a she for me ( until op takes a pics of it from the back with the tail up ... ), 
  my buoy from sui !, 
  edit : seems you good at , [ here are 2 manx cat 's , male and female , prolly mom and son , or brother and sister from the same `` spawn '' ... the black one is not fully black , he 's got a white tuft , really small , of white fur on the belly ... both have crooked vertabraes in the tail , smaller one , the female , also had shorten tail , while the male is a `` longy '' only missing the last 2 or 3 vertebrae , plus lowers `` front '' shoulders than back `` shoulders '' ; i know is strange to have islands ' cats where i live , asked vets about the race and they were `` wtf ? 
  seems manxs ! ... 
  they both were strays , and i 've been adopted , ofc ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m0lj1ae.jpg ), 
  usually 3-colours furs ( tortoise , tabby , calico ) is a female , and , by the pics , or this is a young one ( it is small ) or , again is a female ... 
  exactly , 3 colours usually are females ... tortoise/calico/whatever ... edit : a word ... 
  never said calico ... 
  give the 3-colours fur pattern , is a she ... , 
  omg , is like dawn or sunset for me !!!, 
  in which month do you have such light ? 
  like , solstice , equinox ... ? 
  i guess are ore 's mines in the background ? 
  as for italian 's part , ofc , sardinia goes full hipster ... / s, 
  i can only guess why op likes/choose this pics , ofc turin is underrated , but her `` beauty '' lies in her 's `` condos '' , that for us italians , seems regular 's ones ( just 'cause we used to them ... ) . 
  but for some `` foreingers '' our `` condos '' ( or palazzi as we call them ) looks nice ... my `` theory '' because we are used to the [ bugnato ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/bugnato ) ( wiki link is in italian cuz the en wiki version sucks hard ... ) here are some pics : [ link 1 ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/palazzo_medici_riccardi#/media/file:palazzo_medici_riccardi_by_night_01.jpg ) [ link 2 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/palazzo_rucellai.jpg ) [ link 3 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/ferrara_07-05_%2867%29.jpg ) [ link 4 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/thumb/7/76/mantovapalazzo_te-entrata.jpg/520px-mantovapalazzo_te-entrata.jpg ) [ link 5 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/trapani_palazzogiudeccab.jpg/1920px-trapani_palazzogiudeccab.jpg ) [ and even a church 's facade ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/chiesa_del_ges%c3%b9_nuovo_napoli.jpg/2560px-chiesa_del_ges%c3%b9_nuovo_napoli.jpg ) this `` style '' , or `` concept '' , is clearly revamped in the [ casa mil\u00e0 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/mil%c3%a0_28-2-12.jpg/1200px-mil%c3%a0_28-2-12.jpg ) and latetly [ casa battllo ] ( http://static.thousandwonders.net/casa.batll%c3%b3.original.15425.jpg ) ... ofc , in a different `` manner '' ...

   it seems like the majority of these `` pictures of europe '' posts come from france and we can therefore assume that france is the most beautiful country in europe merci . 
  lol , france 's post and is a roman temple ... wait , you forgot to quote nimes 's arena , world famous arena still in use today for concerts ... after verona ... btw , you forgot the / s plus , ehy , it 's / u/loulan , he is used to post saturated pics of frenchies villages with crossed-facade houses for karma ... / s, 
  so , `` italianisation '' of s.t excuses the feuernacht back in the '60s ? 
  exactly , my '' * what , as a lombard , i do n't like , is sud tirolo , valle d'aosta , friuli and sicilia to be `` autonomous '' regions * '' means this ... except sardinia , none of the it 's regions should be `` autonomous '' ... or , in the other hand , everyone should autonomous ... again , only sardinia should be granted this status p.s - sry broken english ... edit : italy is a 60m nation , is not so easy to implement sui 's model ... 
   and south tyrol is part of italy only for a few decades ... 1918 -  2018 , `` few decades '' ... next year i count 100 yrs ... ( or should todays roma 's inhabitants claim 117 ad regions around eu and med ? ), 
   so it 's ok for them to be an autonomous region , since most of the ppl there are culturally austrians , not italians . 
  it 's ok for them cuz they live on a special conditions , that let them hold the 90 % of the taxes they collect ... 
  this condition earned by the bas back in the [ '60s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/night_of_fire ) ( basically , terrorists , but the electricy was brought to those valleys by the italian central `` agency '' , enel ... also payed by all the `` other '' italians ... ) the fact they do speak another language , does n't grant them a `` special '' condition ( just google how many languages/dialects are spoken in italy ... )  all folks from south tyrol i know in vienna speak far better german than italian ( it 's their mother tongue actually ... and they are around 30ish ) . 
  i 'm 37 , we already kept their `` mother '' tongue , as i would keep my benacense dialect , but in this case `` ubi major minor cessat '' ... plus , they can learn a language spoke by + / - 60m in eu ( i 'm skipping learning latin in high school ... ) the fact that they wo n't speak different languages ( as friuli , or valle d'aosta ) imho , do not gave you a `` special '' status about taxes ... 
  yeah i know , lombardy was also included in the 4 motors of europe back in the days ... do n't get me wrong , again as a lombard , i do n't want to be `` independent '' or `` a country '' alone ... what , as a lombard , i do n't like , is sud tirolo , valle d'aosta , friuli and sicilia to be `` autonomous '' regions ... 
  i 'll only give this special condition to sardegna , 'cause , imho , is an island ... 
   wrong . 
  10 % of all taxes have to be sent to the central government . 
  as a lombard , lol at 10 % ...

   scooters in italy . 
  do n't you fear for your life ? 
  why do you drive like that ? 
  is simple , you can get a 50cc scooter ( ofc you gon na upgrade it ) at 14 yrs old , strange statement from a spanish ... 
  til about the cracks ' sap , usually i knew about pest/fungi/ants ... ty, 
  bikes on highway are `` wildcards '' for italian drivers , cuz , most of us can recognise which kind of bike you riding ( like , a supersport , touring ones , down to 500cc shitty one ... ) so , again , in a 2x2 , you ( or me , as i was a ssport biker ) are the ones to `` give roads '' to cars ( a bike + rider weight less than a car , but , is more agile in terms of speed and torque , usually ... ) and cars ' drivers expect the bike go right lane if flashed/honked . 
  you and your friends were n't `` theoretically '' slow , the guy behind you was too fast ... ( as for the limits ... ) even in the take over lane ( left ones ) , just keep your pace in the right ones , even if your pace is like , 180kmh ... 
  sums up , cuz a lot of people around the world says `` hurr durr , you italians are crazy drivers ... '' is not so hard , if you have a right lane empty , go right lane ( 2x2 , 3x3 ) and stick your pace ( even if above limits , that is 130kmh ) , only switch ( a pls , pls , pls use mirrors when change lanes/take over ) if you need a take over , is easy , is not so far away from german 's highway imho ... 
   italy : who the hell gives these people driving licenses ? 
  do you really post the bible ? 
  i mean , really ? 
  yep , i think aerial views helps a lot , but , in general , the proportions are good for me , even in # 6 pic ( rahova ) , `` brutalist '' or `` soviet '' buildings at least have inner `` courts '' ... that is ok for me ... [ a lot places seems good from distance ] ( http://architizer-prod.imgix.net/media/1395001950863villasaracenohero1.jpg?q=60&amp;auto=format,compress&amp;cs=strip&amp;w=1680 ) ... but not so good when [ close to them ] ( http://imgur.com/j5fior8 ) , 
  if i have tbhf , i expected really bad things , turn out is not so bad , wide avenues , monumental buildings , and a lot of green areas ... good job `` cousins '' ... , 
  ye , where i live we know him as `` hermit ibis '' , and some really dumb fellow people from my province shot one [ down ] ( http://www.giornaledibrescia.it/valcamonica/abbattuto-dai-bracconieri-un-raro-ibis-eremita-1.3129841 ) ( gon na add a quick translation if needed ), 
  hold , so , your friends were in a car on the left lane on a 2x2 highway , close to the max limit ( 130km/h ) right ? 
  and you was following them at reasonable distance ( this is good ) always on the left lane ? 
  right ? ... 
  if i get it as i write up here , reasons are : * 1 - 2x2 highway in italy , right lanes are for slower cars/trucks/tirs / caravans/roulottes , like 100/110kmh ( or below ) pace ... and also for normal max speed ( 130kmh ) * 2 - left lanes are for take overs/big cars/fast cars/reckeless bikers/dickheads ... that means more than 130kmh ; is an unwritten laws in italy , on a 2x2 , even if you are travelling at ( let 's say ) 120kmh , stay in the right lane , take over on the left only if needed , and go back to the right , or , if you want to bet a fine or your driving license and keep a pace more than 140 + kmh pace ( we have `` tutor '' system in a lot of our higways , careful ... ) you keep the left lane and flash and honks to the vehicle in front of you to `` asking road '' ... 
  i think your case is the 2nd , you and your friends were on the left lane , cuz , rightly , you where speeding close to limit , but since is a 2x2 , people faster than you honked for a take over ... 
  ok , but , why uk ? 
  why `` now '' ? ...
