  yeah , we react , everyday , we send our cgs + others military and try to catch the smugglers ... and save people from drowing ( we ca n't let them draw , cuz , is a bad thing , worldwide ... )  what is the political situation in italy regarding this issue ? 
  50/50  i would scared shitless if my country took so many every day . 
  luckily not many of this wave reach finland because of so many semi closed borders on the way . 
  i can feel a lack of sisu in you ( :d ) luckily , we italians are used to it , but , cuz , our coastal borders are a lot more than yours borders , and we are a 60 milions country ( just check google maps and have an idea about difference ... ) we ca n't `` evade '' this duty , since we are founder 's member of eu ... 
   which words exactly ? 
  point me to where i wrote it 's all italian fault . 
  please do it . 
  * `` nor is italian coast guard playing a * little * role if the italy is controlling the triton operation . 
  '' * so , if ita 's cg coordinates the operations ( again , 3rd time , all the players are granted to operate within ita 's waters , means , as extend , that if shit hits the fan , is in ita 's waters ... not international , not french/spanish/greeks and so on ... ) and , ita cg 's should obey from frontex hq , cuz , we are in the eu ... we ca n't take initiative , but at the same time , are `` ours '' waters ... so , is our responsabilities , as we are `` boots to the grounds '' ... in a manner of speaking ...  having hq 's in poland does not mean being controlled by poland , nor it should , to be honest . 
  does belgium control the european parliament or should it just because the parliament is being hosted in brussels ? 
  having hq in a specific nation , it means something , as `` proxy '' ( pls as i already stated in other post , have mercy at this time of my broken angrish ... pls focus at the content , skip the form , plz elaborate . . :d ) and yes , it means something ...  ( i personally found it really really funny to give to a nation like pl the cg 's of all eu , i mean `` reddite quae sunt caesaris caesari et quae sunt dei deo '' ... so tbf , i 'll never give to a pole even a windsurf ... ) yeah , thanks . 
  plz do no take offence , but i 'll swap any eu 's agency hosted by my country for the frontex one 's , in my personal view ( `` first boots on the ground '' policy ... ) cuz , italy is used to have immigrations/integrations since s.p.q.r 's times , we know how to deal with islam/med 's people ... even in `` shadies '' ways ...  is poland not participating in the triton op . ? 
  did it not help hungarians with guarding borders ? 
  does it not donate directly to sirian victims ? 
  also , we have both external schengen and eu borders too , you know . 
  it 's not like nobody tries to smuggle people through polish territory . 
  i 'll skip on that , if we ( italians , greeks , spanish , even french ) should we think like poles , hungarians and so on ... about `` guarding borders '' , given the mediterranean sea , and ** we really ** wants to stop ** any ** `` operations '' in the med from gibraltar to cyprus , it will be be a piece of cake , afair back in the years de via eu gave $ bn to turkey to try to stop immigrants ' flow from tr to ee , guess if italy/greece asked for bn for stopping flow in the meds ? 
  btw , thanks you a lot for the convo , no hard feelings , really ... but i 'm tired atm . . pm if you want ... 
  i get you , elvish , but my angrish at 2.00 am is weak ... what you said in this post is true , but some people seems to do not get it , that 's why i said before then if , at least , in the med , we ( eu ) had a shady 's one like gheddafi , ** at least ** we all had/have someone to talk about about it ( immigration ) like `` the ends justify the means '' ... like it or not ... but it worked ... patagarrasu/franco seeing your flair ... , 
  ok , so is all ita 's cg fault , reading your words ? 
   poland is not a the `` player '' here , nor it is coordinating the action but [ frontex ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frontex ) is based in warsaw , and should be coordinate all cgs of eu ... ? 
  ( i personally found it ** really really funny ** to give to a nation like pl the cg 's of all eu , i mean '' * reddite quae sunt caesaris caesari et quae sunt dei deo * '' ... so tbf , i 'll never give to a pole even a windsurf ... ) our cgs ** must ** save any/all kind of people in the sea ( water is not the best environment for human beings ... other way is to display our navy , and cannon them , but then , already ita took blame for this , will be human 's right violations ... even if we never shot anyone in the med ) but this leads to an escalade of violence ... ofc will be ita navy to act as frontline , as usual ... no ty . 
  ita cg , again , is the frontline ` cus all the other navies/ngos are operating in ** ours ** waters ... but sometimes is easy put the blame on cgs , even are other cgs or ngos that do the dirty job ... eh ? 
  and , at the end , drops 8ks , 12ks , 100ks souls in italy , or greece , far far away from frontex 's headquarters ... 
  i dunno if is right in english , but here , we used to say , `` away from eyes , aways from hearts '' ... 
  ofc is under italian control , we own that waters ( again as italian i 'm deeply sorry to have my own country peninsula in the middle of med , as i already wrote , we are trying to remove s italy from med ... )  croatia , iceland , finland , norway , sweden , germany , the netherlands , france , spain , ireland , portugal , austria , switzerland , romania , poland , lithuania and malta well if any of those nations put even a dinghy on ita 's waters , and rescue people , they should organize the logistics on their soil for id 's them , schedule them , feed them , but on lt , nl , ro and so on soil ... again , sry for broken english ... 
  so , firstpost.com is talking bullshit ? 
  also , tunisia and tripoli ( lybia ) has strong stable goverments with whom eu can clearly talk about immigrants policies ? 
  but italy ( and also greece , do not forget them ... ) have to accomodate all of them , record them , feed them ( even up for 1 yr ... ) even if are others ngos , navies from all around the world that dump here ... but when italy , back in the days , told eu , that the situation will go worst and need backup , the answer was `` o mamma mia !!!, 
  you marios bibidi bobity boopa , git gud on this !!! '', 
  and removed gheddafi ( at least , like it or not , as italians , berlusconi was in charge , but we had a `` head of state '' to whom we could talk about it , even in a shady way ... ) but gave money to gheddafi helped to slow down the flux ... ( maybe a single case where bribery was ok ) ... anyway , i regret mare nostrum operation ... 
   * people were pulled to safety by coastguard vessels , military ships operating under the eu 's border agency frontex and aid boats run by privately funded organisations . 
  their efforts were coordinated by the coastguard . 
  *  * `` together with sea watch and sea eye our crew was able to save more people last night under bad weather conditions , '' the german ngo jugend rettet tweeted on tuesday , referring to two other nonprofit groups . 
  *  * spain 's civil guard said one of its vessels serving under frontex 's anti-trafficking operation triton had rescued 133 people found on an inflatable dinghy off libya . 
  * so , what are the `` players '' here ; german ngos , spanish civil guard , all coordinated by frontex ( poland ) , and ita 's cg ( we are sorry for minding our water guys , really sorry , italians are planning to move the entire peninsula away from these immigrants route , we found out is not so easy as we thought ... ) i like how this article avoids telling where all those immigrants will be dumped , let me guess , italy 's ports and id centers ? 
  i 'm a simple man , but , if a ger ngos , spanish 's civil guards vessels coordinated by frontex under `` triton '' mission , rescue them , they should `` dump '' or , at least , organize logistics to germany and spain first , every countries ' military vessels the same ... start sharing the burden from the start ... tl ; dr : title is misleading , ita 's cg played a little role . 
  sry broken english . 
  no problem ... i 'm here to help ... 
  chill *, 
  same here , n italy , living on ( afair the biggest lake in italy ) 00.15 @ 30 \u00b0 , that means nightime ( minima ) , this is not obsessions , or studio aperto ( due to media 's thing ... ), 
  i think is the 2 $ coins / [ penis ] ( http://static2.fjcdn.com/comments/5538847+_79d3b46067ef54d6bd3bcb7438d0f6ef.png ) old joke about swe/fin ... or am i wrong ? 
  40/45 \u00b0 where i live atm is not fucking common ... ( n italy ), 
  you right , but , 23rd of june ... this is the problem , what about we go through july and august ? 
   because europeans are not constructed for such a high temperatures ( thats why we have white skin ) . 
  spotted the non-mediterranean 's one ... 
  90 to 100 % humidity is not about media manipulation , dude , dunno where you live in italy or you came from italy , but 23rd of june , these temps are just `` fuck off , i 'll go to vietnam to feel a little bit of chill ... '', 
  piacenza ( italy ) 10 days ago got 100 % humidity for 4 days , with 30/35 \u00b0 ... `` welcome to the jungle '' ... 
  ^ this, 
  [ because of this ] ( https://www.ansa.it/english/news/2017/06/23/ten-cities-on-heat-red-alert-in-drought-hit-italy_74e80105-4ff3-4256-a30b-091df8a74139.html ) 35 \u00b0 or even 40/42 \u00b0 is not terrifying , is about how many days ( or weeks ) these temps will go , especially cuz is only the 23rd of june , and add a dry winter + spring = no snow on alps ( for me , due where i live ... ) basically , all the pre-alps lakes are going dry , that means , no water for the plains and rivers = no crops ... atm , i have 29 \u00b0 c @ 23.50 gmt +1 ( if i 'm right ... ) and i 'm more n than 44th parallel ... figure it out ... 
  oh , yes , the monster energy drink of white wines ...

  so , you already know about mona lisa and the landscape ?

  ikea ( ofc ) , wannabe cousine , [ some swede 's chefs think they landed ... but is not ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/foodemperor ) , volvo polaris 's series was a good car ...

  i would like to know how they collect these data , i mean ; do they start from italian ( e.g ) and after add the languages studied in high schools ? 
  ( eng , fr , ger , sp ... ) or also add dialects and `` mother tongues '' from parents ( like for 2nd , 3rd gen immigrants in italy ) ? 
  ... if so , well , probably i could speak with a catalan and we 'll both understand each other ... fact is ; as a whole eu , we can ( could ) speak a lot of languages ... 
  ye i know , `` dacia felix '' :p ... so , `` patria '' is a singular feminine for you ?
