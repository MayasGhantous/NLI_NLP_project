because it creates a controversy , that 's all a newspaper need to make any `` news '' . 
  yes , article 54 of our penal code . 
  nothing new here . 
  this is almost weekly news . 
  the problem is that new clans will always take the lead . 
  same thing is happening in naples , where old camorra members are being arrested and young gangs are gaining power . 
  also most arrets ends in short senteces , only some members get life sentences . 
  [ ( 41bis ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_41-bis_prison_regime ) the only real mafia that has been disappearing is the sacra corona unita , weaker than the others , in the last 10 years it has lost a lot of his power and is now fragmented . 
  tobruk government , internationally recognized and the tripoli government . 
  here 's a [ map ] ( http://www.lookoutnews.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/schermata-2015-06-01-alle-12.58.14.png ) and a [ more detailed one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/libyan_civil_war.png ) last decemeber they signed a deal to cease fire and make a joined government . 
  so far every chance of making that government has failed . 
  yes , otherwise we 'll be considered as another aggressor . 
  we need to cooperate with libyan forces before taking the lead in this kind of operation . 
  yes , there is even a competition for tall ships every year . 
  they are the [ `` amerigo vespucci '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_training_ship_amerigo_vespucci ) and [ `` palinuro '' ] ( http://www.marina.difesa.it/uominimezzi/navi/pagine/palinuro.aspx ) , they are used as training ship for young cadets . 
  did you read the article ? 
  they were kidpanned in 2015 , they were employees of an oilfield construction firm linked to eni . 
  eni ( our biggest oil and gas company ) , which is in libya since 1959 , [ has a lot of interest in the region ] ( http://www.eni.com/en_it/world-eni/index.shtml?country_logo=libya&amp;country_path=libya ) . 
  the company has called back all his employees last year , but it 's still running operations . 
  ( i honestly have no clue who works there for them ), 
  the italian embassy in tripoli was closed in february , last year . 
  [ the good old times man ] ( http://www.lultimaribattuta.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/berlusconi-gheddafi-esilio.jpg ), 
  the right wing parties , such as lega nord and forza italia ( berlusconi 's party ) will get a huge boost in the next election if the immigration trend continues and m5s keeps falling apart . 
  i ca n't see them making a majority though , unless they form an alliance with m5s , that is scary . 
  they are already losing great numbers in polls ( 2-3 % ) . 
  [ yellow line ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/electionaveragegraphitalynext.png ) next elections are in 2018 tho , so a lot can change . 
  italian ( native ) , english , chinese and basic french ( learned in school , never used it ) and spanish . 
  also my italian dialect , does that count ? 
  i 'm no economist , so i do n't have an answer for you . 
  italian banks have been struggling hard even before the brexit . 
  they are working to save them . 
  italian here . 
  we ca n't have a referendum on an international matter , so leaving the eu is out of the question . 
  apart from lega nord and five star movement , no other political party , from left to right , wants italy out of the eu or to abandon the euro currency , so they 'd have no approval on the parlament . 
  so here 's that to you , do n't trust any bullshit you read . 
  what is he trying to achieve by mocking the parlament ? 
  honestly . 
  he 's just adding fuel to the fire . 
  i do n't understand the votes on the left wtf, 
  til we eat frogs, 
  the sudden sale of 7 billion worth of italian government bonds in 2011 during the crisis , altering their value . 
  it 's a two weeks program with 4 officer , 2 in milan and 2 in rome . 
   the energy g7 has had to close without a joint statement because `` the us administration finds itself in a process of revision '' of its energy policy , especially as regards climate change and the paris accords , industry minister carlo calenda said monday . 
  calenda said , however , that here had been `` no friction '' with the us and dialogue had been `` constructive '' . 
  blue is the colour of savoia , which was the ruling house of italy from 1861 until 1946 . 
  it 's just a tradition . 
  well , it 's actually made both in france and italy . 
  it should be a leveret , a young hare . 
  no wonder italo 's founder , luca cordero di montezemolo , was also former chairman of ferrari .

  yesterday marked the 94th annivarsary of the italian air force , he took part in the cerimony . 
  looking at the data , romania is decreasing in both fatalities and injuries . 
  well i think we are on the right track , but a lot more things could improve . 
  better roads , less people driving , eu-wide point system with strict rules on driving licences , better responding time by hospitals and such . 
  the list could go on . 
  you can find a lot more data in the [ annual incident report ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/sites/roadsafety/files/pdf/statistics/dacota/asr2016.pdf ) made by the european commission . 
  that 's the gayest thing i 've seen this week , but i like it . 
  except we pay more money to the eu than we recieve , but i guess that 's the recurring joke ...

  i do n't know honestly , homeschooling is somewhat new in italy and so it 's not really controlled or regulated . 
  social services knocking at your door and making sure you vaccinate your children , otherwise you lose them , since you 're de facto hurting them . 
  just from ages 0 to 6 . 
  ( kindergarten ), 
  yes indeed , but i 'm skeptical about the countermeasures adopted . 
  if i understand correctly , parents will just be sanctioned if their children is not vaccinated . 
  even the biggest sanction is not enough imho . 
   the cabinet on friday approved a decree reintroducing compulsory vaccinations for school admissions . 
  the decree had been held up by a row between health minister beatrice lorenzin and education minister valeria fedeli over the age limit for the obligation , with lorenzin wanting it raised to 10 and fedeli insisting it should be left at six . 
  in the end , fedeli won out .
