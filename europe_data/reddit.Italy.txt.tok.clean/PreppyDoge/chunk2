  you think that your personal philosophy is the very definition of moral political beliefs . 
  i can tell because i 've been in your shoes . 
  but there is a fine line when it comes to acceptance and tolerance . 
  and when you tolerate a belief system that says people like you should be killed , that 's nice and all that you 're tolerant but these people actually want to kill you and will try to kill you !, 
  tolerance is only good when it protects human rights . 
  but once it allows behavior that is destructive to human life that is when tolerance needs to end and when you need to sit down and look at the reality of what modern muslims believe . 
  since there are so many nations with muslim populations its difficult to list numbers for every nation , but i 'll try to cover as much as i can in a reasonably lengthy post . 
  * 24 % of muslims in britain believe suicide bombings are justified , 35 % of muslims in france believe suicide bombings are justified , 13 % of muslims in germany believe suicide bombings are justified , 25 % of muslims in spain believe suicide bombings are justified * http://www.pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf#page=60 * 25 % of muslims do not reject violence against civilians * http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf * 20 % of british muslims sympathize with the 7/7 bombers * http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1510866/poll-reveals-40pc-of-muslims-want-sharia-law-in-uk.html * 25 % of british muslims believe the 7/7 bombing was justified * http://www.cbsnews.com/news/many-british-muslims-put-islam-first/ * pew research ( 2010 ) : 55 % of jordanians have a positive view of hezbollah , 30 % of egyptians have a positive view of hezbollah , 45 % of nigerian muslims have a positive view of hezbollah , 43 % of indonesians have a positive view of hezbollah * http://www.pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/ * 25 % of british muslims disagree that a muslim has an obligation to report terrorists to police * http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/2005/07/more-survey-research-from-a-british-islamist * 58 % of american muslims say criticism of islam or muhammad not protected under free speech * http://www.wnd.com/files/2012/10/wenzelmuslimsq8.pdf * 38 % of american muslims says isis ' beliefs are correct * http://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/150612-csp-polling-company-nationwide-online-survey-of-muslims-topline-poll-data.pdf that should be enough to make my point regarding support for violence . 
  now let 's look at support for the oppressive systems of laws under sharia that place women as second class citizens with few to no rights and condones the execution of gays , women who have sex outside of marriage , and the enslavement/taxation/killing of non-muslims . 
  * 51 % of american muslims want sharia law , and 39 % believe muslims should be exempt from us laws * ( https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2015/06/23/nationwide-poll-of-us-muslims-shows-thousands-support-shariah-jihad/ * 19 % of american muslims say violence is justified to impose sharia * http://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/150612-csp-polling-company-nationwide-online-survey-of-muslims-topline-poll-data.pdf * 28 % of british muslims want britain to be an islamic state * http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/sharialaworonelawforall.pdf and now let 's look at the rate of violence among muslim communities in the west , which are disproportionately higher than any other group . 
  * 77 % of rapes in sweden committed by muslim men * http://www.euro-islam.info/country-profiles/sweden/ ( this article is great as it uses multiple sources within it , check the foot notes for more specifics ) * belgian muslims ( 6 % of total population ) make up 35 % of prison inmates * https://muslimstatistics.wordpress.com/2016/05/21/belgium-35-of-prison-population-is-muslim-who-make-up-only-6-of-population/ * 78 % of crimes committed in copenhagen , denmark committed by muslims * http://www.mx.dk/nyheder/kobenhavn/story/10233641 * alarming rate of unprovoked violence against women in germany by muslim men * http://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/jamtland/polisen-varnar-kvinnor-i-ostersund-for-att-ga-ut i would love to keep beating this dead horse , but i 'm afraid my arms will tired soon . 
  you wanted sources , and now you have them . 
  though every group is susceptible to violence , the math proves that muslim communities have a disproportionate rate of crime , hateful beliefs , and support of violence against women and other groups . 
  more than any other group in any other country . 
  and that reality ca n't be ignored . 
  it 's no xenophobic to say , it 's not racist to point out . 
  islam has a problem that desperately needs to be addressed . 
  sweden 's definition of rape is pretty standard , and is any physically forced sexual act or sexual act while someone is incapable of consent ( such as being passed out ) . 
  the issue that in most countries if a woman is say , forced to give oral sex and then anally raped it would be * two * charges but * one * event of rape . 
  but the swedish police count each act as a seperate rape , and that leads to some number inflation . 
  the thing is , according to br\u00c5 ( government agency in sweden that handles such statistics ) only about 20 % of rapes are reported . 
  so though technically inflated its still pretty high . 
  as it relates to islam in the context of my original comment , most sources put the number of rapes by migrants at about 50 % of total rapes in sweden ( it varies as much as 3 % depending on the source , as the br\u00c5 's last official statistic of migrant rapes was in the 1990 's ) . 
  so you have 14 ( ish ) % of the population committing 47 ( ish ) % of the rape . 
  that 's a clear sign of a problem . 
  that said , sweden has always had a rape problem . 
  even in the 1980 's sweden 's rape statistics were three times higher than those of the rest of europe . 
  so it 's not exclusive to the migrants , but their behavior certainly does n't help . 
  i never said that it does n't happen , but it happens at a substantially lower rate and is by and large discouraged . 
  israelis that have committed murders are decried and shamed by israeli media , and likewise in pretty much every modern nation . 
  that issue with the priests is an issue because people are upset about it , and because people demand justice for it . 
  and every major religion with the exception of islam has an overwhelming condemnation of violence . 
  that 's not to say that things do n't happen , that 's not to say there are exceptions . 
  there always will be . 
  but when it comes to islam violence is far to often the common event , and not the exception . 
  you have pointed out exceptions while completely ignoring the fact that muslim communities have a substantially higher rate of homophobia , sexism , sexual assault , violence , and the encouragement of violent behavior than any other group . 
  it 's an inconvenient truth you may choose to ignore , but the truth it still is . 
  when a conservative leader says something regarding migrants the media is quick to paint them as racist monsters . 
  but when hundreds of thousands of mosques and islamic religious centers around the world teach that a woman has no place in society , that gays should be executed , that non-believers should be killed or enslaved , we just pretend it does n't happen or is only a minority , when statics of muslim opinion show quite the opposite . 
  i 'm not far right , or even close . 
  i 'm a liberal , and because i 'm a liberal i refuse to tolerate any ideology that goes against what liberals have fought to achieve since the age of the enlightenment . 
  equality for all . 
  there should be though , as the amish are just as wrong for making their women cover up as the salafists and other muslims are . 
  yeah the catholic church and some other christian groups do dumb shit . 
  so what 's your fucking point ? 
  why do people like you think that pointing at catholics suddenly destroys every argument that shows the rampant sexism and abuse that is found in muslim communities ? 
  i ca n't stand the catholic church , and it has a thousand year history of blood and violence . 
  i would love to see every priest who has been found to abuse someone get thrown in prison . 
  just because one group has some crazies does n't mean its okay for another group to have crazies . 
  but that said the rate of sexism , homophobia , racism , and violence is disproportionately high among the muslim population . 
  * much higher than in any other population . 
  * that ca n't be ignored . 
  i * can * have the moral high ground because rape , assault , homophobia , suppression , and hatred is wrong no matter who does it . 
  and unlike you i 'm not scared to call out muslim leadership for totally failing to reign in their worshipers like all other religions have . 
  we do n't have christians blowing up bus stations , we do n't have jews going on stabbing sprees , we do n't have mormons storming a concert hall and mutilating and then killing innocent people . 
  we do n't have people from / r/atheism standing at a pulpit and calling for the death of all non-atheists . 
  i recognize that not all muslims are terrorists . 
  yes you pc police have made that * painfully clear . 
  * but there is still an absolutely insane amount of shit that goes on in the muslim community , and more often than not the peaceful muslims are the first victims . 
  by pretending that this insanity is n't happening not only endangers us but also endangers our peaceful friends within the same muslim communities you wish to protect . 
  really depends on where you go . 
  england and the uk as a whole is pretty safe , though as the article shows rates of violence have gone up . 
  generally in muslim areas . 
  in france its the muslim areas plus paris . 
  for whatever reason the parisians just seem to hate jews , and the jewish schools and synagogues often have armed military outside . 
  liberals who are anti-israel seem to misplace their anger and target jews as a whole , and then the conservatives like you seen in front national are anti-foreigner as a whole . 
  but some nations are very friendly and safe . 
  italy is great and so is spain . 
  hungary is another nation where jews can live very peacefully and not encounter any problems . 
  it 's a shame that it is like that , that european officials will bend over backwards while islamists ( and i say islamist , not muslim , to differentiate between the peaceful muslims and non-integrating/violent sharia muslims ) attack their own citizens . 
  a lot of people point at merkel , but i say look at sweden . 
  the highest rate of rape in the modern world . 
  worse than a lot of third world nations even . 
  * this just in , a radical lesbian went on a stabbing spree on the london tube . 
  witnesses reported she screamed `` eat carpet '' as she stabbed and slashed fifteen heterosexual couples * * this is a reminder of the attack last month in paris , where a radical group of lesbians chanting `` allahu degeneres '' opened fire in a bus station outside a popular date spot for straight couples , killing twenty . 
  * just does n't seem to fit ... 
  good friend if mine lived in paris for a while , could not even tell people he is jewish for risk of attack by either muslims or crazy parisians : /, 
  but that analogy fails because nudist lesbians wo n't have the shit beat out of them by their partners , or told that they ca n't enter heaven , if they decide to dress how they want . 
  i think the issue , at least for many of the more liberal french , is that many of these women have no choice but to cover themselves . 
  i do n't think its that they rented out the park for a day . 
  its almost like criminals do n't care about laws . 
  think the americans have it right on this one . 
  in this instance i 'd argue it 's pretty authentically portrayed as well . 
  i 'm just trying to figure out why anyone would want a mini in the first place . 
  the american dream in a nut shell . 
  :d ( a few minutes later ) d :, 
  the fact that free speech is so low makes me concerned all the others will not be so high in future years . 
  `` the restored busts are to be returned to a museum in damascus at the end of the month . '', 
  orrrrrrrrrr they could be stored in safety for just a little while longer . 
  just a thought . 
  that 's why the eu is honestly not that beneficial anymore for big players . 
  england , france , germany , spain , italy , and even small but very industries nations like the netherlands and czech republic could all have booming economies with or without the eu or the euro . 
  but smaller countries in the eu and its economic area stand to benefit the most . 
  i 've been way to busy to follow the election in romania closely . 
  what do the social democrats want to do and why is everyone saying its so bad ? 
  i 've been way to busy to follow the election in romania closely . 
  what do the social democrats want to do and why is everyone saying its so bad ? 
  as long as they pay the same taxes what does it matter ? 
  i 'm going to go out on a limb and assume that all 10 % in france that hate jews is concentrated in paris . 
  israel is the only nation in the middle east where being a member of the lgbt community does n't mean risking your life .
