  they were poor before , but it 's only when they became rich that they started donating millions to an electoral campaign . 
  [ more sources . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/11/euromillions-lottery-winners-colin-chris-weir-donate-bulk-yes-scotland-pro-independence-campaign ) dividing it into party lines is no way to think about the issue . 
  the point is that if the rich can , for all intents and purposes , buy votes by injecting money into electoral campaigns , there is effectively no democracy , and that is a shameful state of affairs . 
  further , i do n't know if you know , but their expressly-stated purpose in donating to the campaign was so that it would be on equal footing with the donations of the other side . 
  they are as of date pretty much the biggest donors of the campaign , having donated fully 80 % of the campaign 's funds - if they had n't contributed this money , the other side would have left them in the dust financially . 
  whether you believe their noble purpose or not , the fact remains that the no campaign enjoys much greater sponsorship , and before the weirs ' donations , the imbalance was even more pronounced . 
  since you declared what you are voting , may i ask you what your reasons are out of interest ? 
  i read the article , but i still fail to see how the op made it out to be something it was n't . 
  he says right there in the title that it 's a competition for high school students . 
  that 's how you foster scientific literacy and growth . 
  that 's the definition of an effort in the sciences . 
  i really do n't know what you are trying to argue here . 
  i thought it was a cern competition ? 
  that counts as an effort in the sciences in my book . 
  thanks for this piece of news , we should really have more about european efforts in the sciences in this subreddit . 
  it 's almost exclusively politics . 
  there 's two sides to every story , and i think this article is trying too hard to push one of them as the ultimate and simple truth ( that the rest of us all have missed no less ! ) . 
  i 'd love a little less bias , and a little more objective analysis . 
  you have to consider the possibility that the withdrawal of the motion to postpone the withdrawal will be withdrawn , but with the caveat that even if it 's not withdrawn , it can still be postponed before the withdrawal deadline ( which will then of course have to be postponed ) . 
  after that things may get complicated . 
  that 's as asinine as linking the wiki pages on casualties of the war in iraq and afghanistan every time somebody brings up capitalism . 
  do n't you know we are at a period of vowel-austerity ? 
  i applaud their economizing . 
  god , i know . both plenken and klempen . 
  i 'm sorry , but i can not help but remain unconvinced of what you say . 
  i think you go too far in your denial of the usage of the word fascist . 
  it 's not a taboo to call someone that if their views align with what it means . 
  and i 'm sure you can find plenty of people in france willing to use it to describe the le pens . 
  why , here 's an [ example ] ( http://www.english.rfi.fr/france/20140307-front-nationals-le-pen-sues-left-winger-calling-her-fascist ) , and [ another ] ( http://www1.rfi.fr/francais/actu/articles/081/article_45894.asp ) ( in french ) , and [ another article ] ( http://www1.rfi.fr/francais/actu/articles/081/article_45894.asp ) about how marine le pen is trying to `` clean up '' the party 's image , and yet [ another ] ( http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/04/14/1292061/-is-marine-le-pen-a-fascist-and-a-fraud-french-courts-say-oui ) that contains the result of that libel suit , in which the french courts found the use of the word `` fascist '' permissible . 
  these articles are n't from the nebulous past - they are part of the discussion right now . 
  i 'm sorry , but i 'm talking about the [ gnr ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/groupes_nationalistes_r%c3%a9volutionnaires ) , a different ( and older ) group . 
  i thought the reference to duprat , its founder , would have made that explicit . 
  you may be young and i do n't want to presume to teach you the history of your country , but le pen has had ties with avowed fascists and neo nazis ever since he stepped on the political arena , and to ignore that just because in their latest party programme they pretend to be somewhat reformed is to forget history . 
  i like to think no respected politician or public intellectual would do that . 
  it 's a very well-known fact that expressly neo-nazi groups , such as fane , supported and briefly joined with front national as far back as its creation in the 70s . 
  if you want to call duprat and the gnr something else because he did n't use the moniker `` fascist '' , but instead called themselves the `` revolutionary nationalist groups '' then i find your version of events far more dangerous . 
  other than that you are still arguing semantics . 
  the far right does n't call itself fascist , so we should ignore them and concentrate on those who * do * call themselves fascists ? 
  it 's almost like a bad joke . 
  if these parties then start calling themselves something else in turn , then we should ignore them too because they are n't fascist anymore ? 
  who are you going to issue those `` warnings against fascism '' against , if not those who * actually * promote fascist ideology ? 
  come on , that 's a very simplistic view . 
  of course their political program is n't going to expressly declare they are fascist - that 's the whole point - but what about their views on , for example , immigration ? 
  what about le pen 's denial of nazi germany crimes ? 
  re-introducing death penalty ? 
  their views on the primacy of france and nationalist concerns over other countries and europe ? 
  fascism is passe in europe , but their ideas are rehashed under different names ( and flags ) . 
  if that 's enough for you to call it something else , by all means do so . 
  right , they do n't call themselves fascists , because that 's illegal . 
  but that 's why i said `` in all but name . '', 
  well if you are talking about the same flags , most of them have changed up . 
  the greek one i know is still in parliament , running on a one-point platform pretty much ( `` kick out the immigrants '' ) , but the rest that i can see have evolved into other parties with different flags , such as the national fascist party in italy dissolving after ww2 and then attempting to re-form over the years under various monikers such as [ italian social movement ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_social_movement ) and so on and so forth up until such garbage as [ la destra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_right ) of the present . 
  france also has had a historical far-right party that is fascist in all but name - [ le front national ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_front_%28france%29 ) . 
  it borrowed elements of its logo and such from the movimento sociale italiano . 
  not nearly . 
  he wanted to, 
  thank you ever so much !, 
  i 'd be much obliged to you . 
  jeroom , the creator of [ this gem ] ( https://ondergrauw.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/roeien4.jpg ) that made it into the [ 4chan hall of fame ] ( http://i.imgur.com/er2wl.jpg ) way back when . 
  i am very fond of his work . 
  ... and you 're back to your good old self . 
  i think that comic must be the most pro-greece think i 've ever seen you post !, 
  there 's all kinds of wrong with your statement . 
  they 're not anti-eu . 
  in fact , they 're expressly pro-eu . 
  they 're anti-austerity . 
  i hope you do n't mean the imf and austerity policies are synonymous with the eu now . 
  they certainly do n't represent me , and i 'm very pro-eu . 
  and , greece is a member of the euro and the eu . 
  if it voted for a party against those things , it should still be heard , since that is where its future is decided for now . 
  disenfranchising someone just because they do n't agree with you on an issue is n't really acceptable . 
  you are right , it was a few other countries with a hardline stance . 
  i said germans because all those proposals came from schauble . 
  it may not have been an actual coup but you surely see where the sentiment comes from since you can agree they tried to topple the greek government . 
  saying `` coup '' is a twitter-style shorthand for expressing all that . 
   can you blame them for wanting a new face to speak for greece , democratically elected and backed by all political parties to ensure that reforms would happen that is syriza . 
  that 's the democratically-elected party . 
  that 's the party backed by 250/300 greek mps coming into the negotiation . 
  that 's the party with the 62 % referendum vote . 
  that 's as democratically-elected as you can get . 
  so if they try to topple them , yes , i can blame them . 
  well , that 's the unfortunate condition for them lending you money . 
  you have to repay them back first . 
  if you can read that article and even believe the man being interviewed to quote it , you ca n't make the small leap to believing that the germans wanted to instigate a change of government yesterday ? 
  he already accuses them of as much in the article . 
  i 've read it , it 's been posted before , it 's a greek insider from the negotiating team . 
  he details how they were blackmailed at every turn from their european counterparts to accept harsh terms . 
  if you can read this whole thing , take him at his word , and believe what he says , i ca n't even begin to imagine how you can paint the greeks as the villains . 
  he explicitly talks about how dijsselbloem threatened to collapse their banking system , how schauble offered them money to exit the euro , and yet you think they wanted to create a global crisis ? 
  if not more frequently . 
  more countries are on the horizon . 
  uhh , this article does n't really verify that . 
  it in fact explicitly says the opposite of what you claimed . 
   they went for the referendum , which means that they would have to do what they did in cyprus for a week . 
  they believed the situation would bring them closer to a deal . 
  they did n't want a crisis . 
  if you do please link it . 
  sounds like pretty bad journalism to me to quote as fact . 
  an $ 85m bond repayment being delayed will not cause a shock in the wake of this agreement .
