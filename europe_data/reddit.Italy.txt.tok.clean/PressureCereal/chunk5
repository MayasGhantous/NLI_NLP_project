  profound contradictions in your comments . 
  first  literally nothing good in life is produced fast and without struggle . 
  but then  also the modern world make a lot of stuff much easier . 
  your narrative changes to suit your point , ignoring the reality of what making a debt sustainable really means . 
  except austerity after 6 years has produced no viability of the debt , it only has produced more and more misery and poverty . 
  you just bankrupt your lender and sink them deep into a recession - how is that going to enable them to pay any debts ? 
  answer : not at all . 
   literally nothing good in life is produced fast and without struggle . 
  right , so why does the imf expect greece to enact reforms the rest of europe did over 80 years in the space of 5 , and pay up today , instead of giving them time to produce a viable economy ? 
  your arguments are entirely self-defeating . 
  that is for the eu to decide , however , in the proper democratic way . 
  not unilaterally by the imf or any collection of banks . 
  it should n't be a shock especially to the economists who mandated austerity . 
  a lot of countries use debt as a lever to finance their economies . 
  all peripheral countries in the eurozone did it , the uk does it , the us does it . 
  sustainable debt just means that your economy can support it , but if you mandate the economy shrinks to depression levels with austerity policies , it becomes evident that it wo n't be able to sustain that debt anymore . 
  this has absolutely nothing to do with bonds . 
  this has to do with everyday bank liquidity . 
  if banks in euro countries have to pay out large amounts of euros , they would normally turn to the reserves of their national banks , but since they do n't have national banks anymore , they have to turn to the ecb . 
  if you ca n't ensure banks have enough euros to give out to their customers , then what is the purpose of having the euro ? 
  this is like your national bank not performing its raison d'etre function . 
  but done almost nothing about actually growing their economy , while at the same time still having to pass severe reforms and cut expenditures . 
  in short , roll the debt back , but get no useful income . 
  simply postponing the crisis for when the next round of payments comes . 
  with this strategy we will have a mini crisis every 2 months . 
  it 's absurd . 
  do you seriously entertain the idea that greece has been helped so far by the imposition of this severe austerity ? 
  that we mandated a country shrink its gdp by 25 % , suffer youth unemployment of close to 60 % , cut expenditures on all fronts while trying to pass reforms , and it would turn out ok ? 
  i shudder to think what the `` whole medicine '' would be . 
  even calling it medicine is entirely misleading , when imf officials have admitted mishandling of the greek situation . 
  [ it consists of both long term and short term loans . 
  ] ( http://graphics.wsj.com/greece-debt-timeline/ ) you can see how greece must pay to the ecb $ 3bn in july and another $ 3bn in august , to the imf loans every few weeks for half a billion or so starting today with $ 1,5 bn , and so on . 
  the rates are also included so see for yourself . 
  in short , by the end of the summer greece needs to pay $ 14bn to its creditors . 
  so , the crucial question is , why did the ecb not extend liquidity to greek banks , if greece could supposedly stay ? 
  that 's as political as you can get from what is supposed to be a financial instrument . 
  but the problem is that the conditions we imposed ensure they will never grow their economy , nor use that money in any meaningful capacity other than paying back the older loans . 
  honestly , that 's pretty stupid by renzi . 
  misrepresentations and reproductions of idiotic stereotypes are the order of the day in the entirety of europe it seems . 
  both sides are acting childishly , and it 's sad to see renzi playing his part . 
  it does n't look like you thoroughly read the paper you linked , which reinforces my points . 
  the graph in page 28 shows a very sharp drop in capital flows circa 2006-7 , dropping from 45 % to less than 5 % of gdp . 
  if you do n't call that a drop , then i 'm not sure what qualifies . 
  the graph you mentioned in particular talks about cross-border bank assets in general , and definitely not about from and to the periphery . 
  further , if you look at the debt-equity mix flows , which is the kind we are talking about , the extremely sharp drop in inflows is quite apparent around 2006-2007 - assets drop and liabilities surge . 
  it does make quite a lot of difference whether domestic organizations , such as pension funds or greek banks , were forced to take a haircut , because their prosperity directly reflects on the prosperity of the average greek . 
  a prosperous private sector at the expense of the public sector may sustain an economy with domestic investment ; but a poor private sector * and * a poor public sector is simply unsustainable , as you have witnessed . 
  i 'm not sure you 've understood what i 'm trying to say . 
   first off , the facts on which your point is based : eurozone bond rates did converge , and radically so . 
  converged , but in the beginning , they were unequal . 
  that is the whole point . 
  i simply used your source . 
  check the 10y spreads for the countries involved between 1999 and 2001 , if you do n't believe me , or if that 's trouble , i could conceivably post a screenshot . 
  or alternatively have a look at the graph you posted . 
  investors in the core were happy about the relatively high returns they were getting in the periphery , the periphery countries enjoyed an economic boom financed in part by this easier access to the abundant capital of the core , and exports from the core to the periphery surged . 
  because of this , however , by 2004 there was virtually no difference in interest rates of the periphery countries and that of germany - the capital flow can only last for so long . 
  eventual convergence is a natural consequence , but is beside the point . 
  or , if anything , it reinforces it : capital flow stemmed when the rates equalized - no more `` quick bucks '' to be made . 
   far from the euro driving such flows `` by design '' , your own logic would make it reduce such flows . 
  the logic is that it offers higher rates concordant with * lower risk * and ease of access to investors within the eurozone , by virtue of its common currency and the unified trading zone , is the crucial point . 
  for the same reason that uk rates surged during that time - higher perceived risk due to the effect of the currency . 
  and the reason why the primary holders of greek debt were countries ** within ** the eurozone , not outside it . 
  and lastly , all which i 'm saying about capital flows are n't new or my own invention . 
  they are well documented in historical cases when barriers to trade are brought down . 
  i mentioned two examples , mexico and asia , but there are others . 
  supposing i 'm indeed right , does that affect your thoughts about the 2012 haircut ? 
  should n't be comparing to ireland , ireland 's case is similar to greece 's in terms of capital influx due to the eurozone . 
  such capital flows to poorer countries was by intentional design . 
  one of the perceived benefits of the euro was to make it easier for capital to flow from countries with abundant capital , and thus relatively low returns to investments , to countries that were relatively capital-poor , and that therefore offered high returns on investments . 
  this is considered crucial in the process of economic convergence you mention , in which less developed countries catch up with the more developed . 
  for the 10 year bonds issued at the moment when greece entered the eurozone , and maturing roughly in 2009 , when the crisis started , ** greece paid about 1 % -3 % ** more than france , germany , and the other capital-rich countries that are at the core of the eurozone : the benelux countries , austria , finland , and so on . 
  the adoption of the euro by the `` periphery '' countries in 1999 allowed lenders in the eurozone 's core to take advantage of these relatively high rates of return in the periphery ( and they are higher rates , no denying that , i checked your source to corroborate it ) . 
  and countries like greece were able to benefit from the influx of capital that reduced borrowing costs . 
  in short , the adoption of the euro as a common currency was designed to cause large capital flows from the eurozone core to the periphery . 
  this kind of influx of capital is not uncommon . 
  it 's happened before with mexico and nafta in the early 1990s , and east asia in the mid-to-late 1990s . 
  the problem is that such surges in capital flows depend on the whims of international investors , and therefore have a notorious tendency to come to a sudden stop if investor sentiment changes . 
  and when that happens , severe financial crisis often follows . 
   there was no `` quicker buck '' , because there was no greek risk premium . 
  that is my whole point . 
  there ** was ** a quicker buck to be made : by * design * . 
  so that capital flows could be realized into the periphery . 
  otherwise if the rates were the same , why would anyone lend ireland ? 
  or greece ? 
   because they held most greek debt can you provide a source for that ? 
  i ca n't find any that verifies that claim . 
  i only find ones that say the opposite . 
  [ here is a reuters source for 2010 ] ( http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/images/2010/may/wblog1.gif ) and [ here is a source for 2011 estimates ] ( http://www.emergingmarkets.org/images/516/84516/iif%201%20jpg%20adjusted.jpg ) after selective buyouts and ecb/imf involvement . 
  it did not apply to all banks , at all . 
  it was a private sector involvement haircut and it hit greek banks and greek pension funds the hardest . 
  for example , greek pension funds owned state bonds worth 21 billion euros , with pension funds purchases totaling 7.0 billion euros , while the remaining 14 billion euros were deposits with the bank of greece which were later forcefully invested in new state bonds . 
  pension funds would use state bonds as collateral for their borrowing from commercial banks ( in the form of repos ) saw their bonds nominal value fall to 25 % . 
  a memorandum , later ratified by parliament , envisaged that pension funds could use a mix of state property assets , shares , deposits and other sources to recover any losses suffered by their bond portfolios , which has n't , to this day , happened in any capacity . 
  you do n't have the facts right . 
  greek banks and greek bond holders were forced to take a haircut en masse in 2012 . 
  the rest of the debt , owned by foreign banks and foreign entities , was assumed by the european taxpayers . 
  in short , the foreign banks were bailed out , the greek banks were not . 
  can you explain , if these banks are always going to be bailed out since they are `` necessary '' , and thus never entail any risk of a bad investment , why greece has to pay a higher price in interest than say , germany , to borrow money ( in the form of bonds ) from said banks ? 
  higher interest rates directly mean increased risk . 
  if there is no risk , as you imply , then there should n't be any higher interest .
