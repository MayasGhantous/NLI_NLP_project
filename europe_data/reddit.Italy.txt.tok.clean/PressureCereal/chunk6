  greece , even before the crisis , paid much more money in interest to borrow money than many of its european partners , thus ensuring a quicker buck for the banks which lent it money while assuming none of the risk ( or responsibility ) . 
  heh , no way . 
  the curva would eat him up for breakfast . 
  it 's the dutch sign for `` owl wildlife sanctuary '', 
  that 's funny because ferrero ( which makes nutella and a thousand other chocolate products ) are headquartered since their inception near turin , at a small little town called alba ( which is where half of my family comes from ) . 
  interesting factoid : nutella was made by accident when the first owner of the confection factory added hazelnut to save money instead of using 100 % chocolate, 
  wow , talk about failure to read , my friend . 
  the reports are right there . 
  make an effort and read them instead of embarrassing yourself further and talking about things `` we all know '' . 
  or , if you ca n't be bothered to read a report before you comment on it , as you 've just proven is a possibility , i 'll provide some summaries for you to read the titles of . 
  [ npr : imf admits ` notable failures ' in greek bailout ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/06/05/189005580/imf-admits-notable-failures-in-greek-bailout ) [ bbc : imf admits mistakes on greece bailout ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-22791248 ) [ guardian : imf ` to admit mistakes ' in handling greek debt crisis and bailout ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/imf-admit-mistakes-greek-crisis-austerity?guni=network%20front:network-front%20main-3%20main%20trailblock:network%20front%20-%20main%20trailblock:position1 ) [ wsj : imf concedes it made mistakes on greece ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/sb10001424127887324299104578527202781667088 ), 
  thanks for assuming . 
  i have read the report , as it happens . 
  [ here it is , in pdf format ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf ) , so you can read it too . 
  imf has repeatedly admitted its mishandling of the greek situation . 
  i have read the past reports , too . 
  [ here is one from 2013 ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr13156.pdf ) where they admit ` notable failures ' in the greek bailout process . 
  you can find even more if you try . 
  here 's a quote , straight from the report :  `` there were also notable failures . 
  market confidence was not restored , the banking system lost 30 percent of its deposits , and the economy encountered a much deeper-than-expected recession with exceptionally high unemployment . 
  public debt remained too high and eventually had to be restructured , with collateral damage for bank balance sheets that were also weakened by the recession . 
  competitiveness improved somewhat on the back of falling wages , but structural reforms stalled and productivity gains proved elusive . '', 
  i 'm beginning to think you accuse others of what you are yourself guilty of , skimming headlines and forming conclusions without actually having read the reports . 
  why is that ? 
  are you completely out of touch with reality ? 
  30 % unemployment , 60 % youth unemployment , gdp shrinking of unheard of levels is in no way `` working '' . 
  serviceable debt is not a goal in itself , it 's a result of a viable economy . 
  destroying a country 's financial prospects for years to guarantee serviceable debt is an idiotic and destructive policy that will result in no gdp , no employment ... and no debt . 
  hooray ? 
  further , serviceable debt is not what this solution has provided , as you may have observed . 
  greece is no more able to service its debt now than it was when the crisis started , but it has also experienced a great depression in the meantime . 
  even imf , the staunchest proponent of austerity , came out and said it has n't worked , that its program in greece was a mistake , misguided and misplanned . 
  how you can defend it is beyond me . 
  it 's absolutely delusional to think that . 
  if it were up to me i 'd fit you snugly under our heel `` escape oppression !, 
  come and live under the heel of italy ! '', 
  the advertising writes itself , really . 
  a great scientist has appeared in one of your ~ ~ cities ~ ~ ~ ~ countries ~ ~ continent !, 
  yurop can into scientific dominance !, 
  thanks , i did n't know about that . 
  worth noting the article is a few days old . 
  since , turkey has already [ denounced ] ( http://www.todayszaman.com/diplomacy_turkey-slams-european-parliament-call-for-recognition-of-armenian-genocide_375245.html ) the resolution by the european parliament . 
  [ countries that recognize the armenian genocide . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_genocide_recognition#countries ) of those , the ones in the eu are : * belgium * cyprus * france * germany * greece * italy * lithuania * netherlands * poland * slovakia * sweden some regional parliaments have also recognized it , but not the country they belong to : * spain * parliaments of four regions recognize the armenian genocide : * basque country * catalonia * balearic islands * navarre additionally , the city of burjassot has recognized the armenian genocide . 
  * united kingdom * * wales * scotland * northern ireland -- the countries ** not ** having officially recognized the armenian genocide in the eu are : * austria * bulgaria * croatia * czech republic * denmark * estonia * finland * hungary * ireland * latvia * luxembourg * malta * portugal * romania * slovenia * spain ( see above ) * united kingdom ( see above ), 
  the banks got bailed out , friend . 
  the greeks did n't see that money . 
  do n't you wonder why greece ca n't get back on its feet , even after receiving supposedly all these billions ? 
  oh , i agree completely with bureaucracy reforms , they can only be a good thing . 
  but they take time and money , as evidenced by the fact that our respective countries have n't mastered them yet . 
  about germany 's critical stance , that is a tangential discussion and not really important to what we were saying , but since we got into it : i think it 's more of a series of pr moves that are supported by populist press rather than substance . 
  on your example , for instance , about non-concrete proposals , the greek government published an entire folder of proposals a day after the negotiations to counter the rhetoric that `` they have no numbers '' , and mr. varoufakis later said that he was even asked to keep it deliberately vague so that it could pass in other countries ' parliaments . 
  therefore that is an instance of criticism that holds no water whatsoever , and it 's not the first one . 
  i 'm very disappointed in anyone who adopts it - including my own government at times . 
  they choose to read more on varoufakis 's wardrobe and public stance than the actual discussion that he seeks to have . 
  i agree to begin with , but : a national bank that supports investment is nothing more than a government subsidy , really . 
  does n't matter what you call it , it would still require the greek government budgeting money to such an endeavour that it does n't currently have , and that europe is not willing to provide . 
  i would be completely in favor of what you proposed , european money being put to such uses like you mention instead of repaying older loans with the new ones . 
  about bureaucracy and corruption , of course that is something they are trying to fix , i think it 's some of syriza 's more prominent suggestions , but i do n't think it 's fair to ask the greeks to implement infrastructure changes that other countries undertook in the course of decades and still has n't gotten completely figured out ( just look at every other european country , look at france and italy for example , even germany is plagued by bureaucracy ) , and to do it in 5 years * and * while under extreme austerity . 
  these things take time , because they have taken time for every country that has implemented them , and they take lots of money as well . 
  my point being that you ca n't ask and expect greece to cut down spending on everything , but at the same time repay your loans , stimulate the economy , rebuild the infrastructure , cut the bureaucracy and the red tape , invest in industry diversification , reinvent the tax system , and when they obviously ca n't do those things within 5 years , point the finger and say , well , greeks have n't done anything . 
  not saying that is what * yo * u said , you understand , but it is the prevalent ( politically-motivated ) european narrative at the moment . 
  it 's exactly what the german government and schauble has been doing to an absurd extent - they have been very vocal about syriza for `` losing time '' and not having fixed everything already when they 've been in power for about one month . 
  very right , but it 's impossible to implement building up of different industry sectors under the austerity conditions that greece has been abiding in the last 7 or so years . 
  this is not sound reasoning . 
  like i said , some countries have service-based economies . 
  that is fine . 
  not everyone can be a manufacturing giant . 
  how then do you measure productivity of service industries ? 
  for example , greece has always had a huge tourism industry , which on paper does n't have high productivity , even when it 's profitable . 
  i 'll look it up , thanks, 
  what is the title ? 
  i 'm interested in this . 
  do you have a source ? 
  remember that productivity is affected by the value of goods being produced . 
  in a german-like heavy production economy , the markup of the goods being produced increases the productivity rating significantly . 
  in other words , a country who producing cars will always have higher productivity than one who produces vegetables . 
  also suppose two countries produce the exact same car in the exact same time , but one sells it for a higher price ( for whatever reason ) . 
  that country will have higher productivity index . 
  also , in a service-based economy , it does n't always reflect the amount of work put into producing the end result , either , because how do you adequately gauge a service 's cost ? 
  italy 26-27 .5 %, 
  very interesting , thanks a lot for the information !, 
  you know what , i did n't even know about that period of time . 
  my mistake . 
  you 're right about the first part , but wrong about the second : greece is still in nato . 
  i agree , the western moniker we use nowadays is pretty much a political one . 
  but latin and roman culture is derived to a great extent from the greek culture that immediately preceded it . 
  rome conquered greece and absorbed most of its culture and tradition , starting with the gods . 
  `` western '' civilization was born in greece , not rome , because rome took on the greek culture almost completely . 
  and because the enlightenment was found on mostly ancient greek ideals . 
  the same words exist in most languages . 
  patriotism , nationalism , chauvinism . 
  fix-it felix and wreck-it ralph !, 
  i 've enjoyed our chat so i 'm sorry in advance if i ca n't reply in more detail now as i 'm about to leave work and head for home . 
  let me focus on one-two salient points and i 'll get to the rest in a better time . 
   what remedy do you believe the company has , or do you believe it should have any remedy there at all ? 
  should it just be a case of `` investor beware '' ? 
  because that 's what it is without isds . 
  i 'm unsure if you 've ever worked with government , but in my experience , changes of government very rarely ( at least in states that are n't a total mess ) result in not honoring previous engagements , not to mention that a reversal of law can not retroactively make illegal previous actions - that is a fundamental aspect of law and government , or any change of government would result in a whole bunch of companies suddenly finding themselves out of a job . 
  but if these engagements are indeed not honored by the new government , suitable recourse is provisioned for by the contract in almost all cases .
