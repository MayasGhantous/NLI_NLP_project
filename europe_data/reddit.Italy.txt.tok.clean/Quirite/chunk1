wow ... the things you learn . 
  did we give a train to gaddafi ? 
  keep in mind that none of our trains are actually * that * bad - quite the contrary - but belgium and the netherlands recently purchased a rather terrible batch of pax trains from ansaldo breda . 
  the project seemed ... ~ ~ good ~ ~ decent on paper but turned out to be quite flawed , to say the least : mechanics tried to fix them several times to no avail , and the trains just had to be sent back to the factory . 
  i am sincerely appalled by all this . 
  `` how much did the new sofa cost you ? '', 
  `` oh , just a million '' . 
  convos like this are still fairly common , and my parents are still thinking in lire ... also , when i was younger i managed to amass some 75.000 l. - the pocket money of ( a quarter of ) a lifetime . 
  then we went with grandma at the bank in order to exchange the money , and the teller only gave me 35 . 
  euros . 
  i 'm still disappointed to this day . 
  nope . 
  i swear i had just read `` eu to provide armenia with fresh air '' . 
  the * coperto * is illegal in rome ( and the surrounding lazio region ) , though . 
  i very much like the [ monument to victor emmanuel ii ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/piazza_venezia_-_il_vittoriano.jpg ) , as well as the parthenon in athens : ca n't wait until they finish all those restoration works ( but i know well i 'll be probably old and senile by then ) . 
  thanx both . 
  oops !, 
  no , i meant swedish meatballs ... what 's the correct name ? 
  i love you , sweden : without abba , * k\u00f6ttbullar * , paradox games , garlic-flavoured crisps and ... uhm , * swedish women * , life would n't quite be the same . 
  but i also love you , greece because of the people , of the culture , and * tzatziki * . 
   do you think it is going to be beneficial in general ? 
  * no , i do n't think so . 
   or is it going to a tread for the sovereignty of european people ? 
  * yeah , it might very well turn out to be such a thing ...  do we have to worry just reading what have been already leaked ? 
  * yes - and i do n't like how both parties are negotiating the whole thing behind closed doors . 
   what is the coverage of the demonstrations , if any , in your country ? 
  are there a huge movement in your country ? 
  * the whole ttip issue is getting blissfully ignored by our local media . 
  however , the farcical * five star movement * is - unfortunately - the only one publicly opposing the treaty , which was also criticised during the latest rally in rome ( it took place earlier this month in the circus maximus ) . 
  but what about eu food regulations ? 
  i 'm afraid that the other party wants us to lower them in the name of business and this is something i am not willing to concede ... 
  i 'm also concerned about the many traditional food products covered by the pdo/pgi/tgs labels , which can only be produced in certain european regions . 
  in my opinion , letting the americans freely export their counterfeit version of , say , * parmigiano reggiano * will be detrimental for us . 
  i 'm not surprised in the slightest - the russians have been pulling out this kind of shit for decades now . 
  in italy we 've got * euro * [ \u02c8\u025buro ] and * centesimo * [ t\u0283en\u02c8tezimo ] , whose plural is * centesimi * [ t\u0283en\u02c8tezimi ] . 
  the plural * euri * , while not grammatically incorrect , is frowned upon by most but can often be heard in rome . 
  thank you both !, 
  but what do the people think about it ? 
  is the public opinion favourable to such a development or ... ? 
  just curious , is there any chance that moldova could be ( re ) united with romania ? 
  he 'd better watch out , kim jong-il was an internet expert too ... 
  they come from all over the world , really - but there are mainly americans , british and germans . 
  i used to see lots of japanese too but now there are far more chinese tourists ( some shops are already looking for mandarin-speaking applicants ) . 
  there are n't many russians around , but they tend to be high-end travelers ... where i live ( borgo pio ... near st. peter 's ) you 'd be hard-pushed to spot a single roman ; and if it were n't for the many italians that everyday try to get into the nearby vatican pharmacy - where medication costs 20 % less than over here - i 'd end up thinking to be the only italian in that part of town !, 
  it 's a good plan , but should n't the government focus on removing all those overhead cables first ? 
  i thought both genoa and naples were among the biggest ? 
  just shut the bloody fuck up , asshole . 
   you get croatia and we slovenia + triest , deal ? 
  seriously , wtf spain ? 
  also - was there any need whatsoever to bring back that priest from the ebola-infested backass of nowhere ? 
  perhaps , the fact that the place you 're currently living in was part of italy might have something to do with the locals ' knowledge of italian ? 
  by the way , i live right next to vatican city - i think it counts as a state border , does n't it ? 
  - all i ever see is grumpy swiss guards , health pilgrims ( the vatican pharmacy is just a few blocks away and drugs cost 20 % less there ) plus a shitload of tourists . 
  yep , that 's my impression . 
  renzi is also the ( not that much ) left-wing equivalent of berlusconi , minus the wild sex life and media empire . 
  gaddafi was tolerated mainly because of oil and the fact that italy ( a nato member ) was the biggest - if not the * only * - commercial partner of libya at the time . 
  the regime also proved useful in preventing many immigrants from reaching the italian shores , and this is exactly why our politicians kept dealing with him no matter what ... at least until shit began hitting the fan . 
  i dare say we shot ourselves in the foot in 2011 . 
  well , this is what happened . 
  nope . 
  * before !, 
  our president appointed them . 
  ok , it should 've been `` two unelected pms '' . 
  ( i mean monti & renzi - letta was both democratically elected * and * a footnote to history ) . 
  daaamn , bulgaria , you 're catching up fast ... ... but wait until you get three unelected pms in a row . 
  on the other hand , many of the southerners i 've spoken to think we 're rather * unfriendly * ( go figure ) . 
  also , we 're supposed to be lazy folks who speak in a rather unpleasant accent ... just ask any northerner . 
  why is latium captioned as `` gays '' ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  i 'm afraid that was greece . 
  we did not have many problems while invading your country in 1939 ... 
  [ data expunged ], 
  it could be argued that not even italy as a whole has got what you 'd call a `` mediterranean '' culture ... 
  i think we 'd all vote against any and all such proposals . 
  both ** rome ** and the surrounding region of ** latium ** have been under papal control from the early middle ages till 1870 , and many people would n't be ok with the idea of giving up our sovereignty to an obscurantist theocracy ; this goes without saying that our head of state may very well be a foreigner , so here 's another point against . 
  besides , latium per se is one of the few regions totally devoid of any independence movement : the only shining moment of our history was 2000 years ago and since then we have mattered very little on the international , or even domestic , stages . 
  we 're mostly renowned for our earthy cuisine , the fact of speaking a bunch of dialects which are widely regarded as silly ( or unpleasant ) and generally lacking a well-defined , separate culture . 
  in other words we 're just ordinary italians and little more ... the very idea of becoming something else is pointless . 
  unsurprisingly , my former university 's near the very bottom ( # 202 ) . 
  and that 'd be rome 's main uni . 
   a new election . 
  i think this government will fall ( ... ) i have never experienced this , the last one was in 1958 . 
  wow , and to think we 're used to having the government fall every year or so . 
  ;-) btw , do you think this new party is really willing to address the immigration issue ? 
  what about the equality policies ? 
  are they going to change something ( please pardon my skewed , and a bit clich\u00e9d , perspective on sweden ) ? 
   libya ~ ~ is ~ ~ ** was ** the most developed country in africa ftfy  eritrea is the north korea of africa . 
  that 's true . 
  to be fair , we lost control of eritrea after 1942 and then our former colony was merged with ethiopia in the '50s . 
  the current ~ ~ government ~ ~ dictator , isaias afewerki , came in power after the country 's war of independence ( which ended in 1993 ) so the human rights mess we know today is * not entirely * our fault . 
  actually , eritrea was in the past a decent place to be and the same could be said of somalia before siad barre 's rise to power ( which took place in 1969 , nine years after the country 's independence ) . 
  * what ? 
  we had colonies ? 
  really ?!, 
  * jokes aside , i think the prize goes to ** eritrea ** , our very first colony ( 1882 ) . 
  the country , and more precisely its capital , asmara were - and still are in part - a slice of italy in east africa : there are lots of colonial-era buildings standing , many eritreans speak or ar least can understand our language , some thousand italians still live there and asmara itself has got an italian high school ... plus there 's plenty of good italian/eritrean food to be had . 
  it should also be noted , though , that the current eritrean government is doing its best in order to prevent people from appreciating their country . 
  * ** somalia ** would be a close second ( indeed , it became our second colony in 1890 ) but many people , including our rather short-sighted political establishment , seem to have forgot the country 's very existence after the fall of the communist regime in 1991 and the following year 's military intervention ... much to the somalis ' dismay , it seems . 
  * we are too ashamed to even think about ** ethiopia ** having ever been an italian possession ; besides , we were there for only six years or so . 
  enough said .
