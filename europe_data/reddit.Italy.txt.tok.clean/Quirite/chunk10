  the quality of the teachers can vary from place to place but many - if not most - are old and use the same antiquated approach that end up boring the hell out of a pupil . 
  buildings too tend to be old and grey , albeit not necessarily unpleasant . 
  the so-called * convitti nazionali * ( which often bear the name of a monarch - like the `` umberto i '' , the `` vittorio emanuele ii '' , the `` regina margherita '' etc. , etc. , etc. ), 
  deserve special mention as they represent a somewhat-posher version of an ordinary high school , with the added boon that these have basically been around since forever and are thus seen as prestigious . 
  they could be considered something in between a private school and a public one . 
   do you think education would be better put in private hands ? 
  that 's so 1995 . 
  the concept now belongs to the same place as vhs , fax machines and those weird russian hairstyles . 
  3.5 inches of pure pleasure . 
  it still is . 
  perhaps not even the austrians themselves can stand south tyroleans . 
  naaah , [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/kingdom_of_italy_1924_map.svg ) will do the trick . 
  ;-) if all we wanted was yet another local tv station ( looking at you , tele capodistria ) broadcasting soft pornos at night we might actually prefer to annex san marino instead . 
  unfortunately we lack a valid cb and i 'm afraid that `` acquire porn '' might not actually be considered a legit reason to invade another country ... but who knows . 
  mmmh , come to think of it we could just take istria back . 
  plus there 's still plenty of `` oppressed minorities '' in the area , so ... \\* wink wink nod nod *, 
  forgotten ? 
  we ca n't even stop bickering about them ... plus we should take into account the simple fact that almost every single one of our slimy politicians and union leaders appears rather anxious to remind you just how much they support the country 's `` antifascist values founded upon the heroic exploits of the resistance '' , whatever that means . 
  and god forbid you either point at these people 's flaws or dare mention the other , non-communist formations lest the anpi gets all prissy and you labelled a fascist . 
  oh and let 's not forget about liberation day , allegedly a very popular holiday everybody should kind of look forward to but which has long degenerated into our yearly two minutes ( hours ? ), 
  of hate instead . 
  rocket fuel ca n't melt putin . 
  oh shit , here we go again ... 
  better create a bipolar one then , so as to match putin 's personality . 
  yes , but i personally feel that these are n't that great either ... on one hand you 've got silly ( not to mention forgettable ) comedies , on the other there are many film-makers who not only like to take themselves * very * seriously but actually fail to offer a ` relatable ' portrayal of our society . 
  both of them suck , but in different ways . 
  not quite , but imho de sade 's essay about the customs of the aristocracy in 17th-century france offers a most accurate depiction . 
  did you know that it was totally ok for noblemen to poison their own mothers for monetary gain ? 
  no , not in my experience . 
  none - at least not those made by americans ( which make up a good 99 % percent anyway !, 
  almost good enough for eurovision , i say !, 
  catchy tune ... 
  please press # 1 to beg for mercy, 
  over here you live in a condominium ... and [ you get buried in one ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/images/2013/07/30/211707925-1b94d8c4-c072-4ca9-bc42-c33fedc39f09.jpg ) as well !, 
  i 'd rather be cremated and have the ashes scattered instead . 
  now now , are n't you being a tad too vocal about it ? 
  the bureau of bureaucracy , of course . 
  did we really need more of those cowardly dipshits ? 
  not an expert , but one should keep in mind that the place 's manned by a particular unit whose members are - if i am not mistaken - actual doctors/scientists . 
  it 's not like they put some cpl. 
  nobody watering the plants ... 
  uhmmm , we elected some dude ( letta ) from the now-ruling party but that guy was a weak leader with all the charisma of a brick , who also got eaten alive by a power-hungry youngster ( renzi ) in no time . 
  the prez then appointed renzi as pm because ~ ~ he had a soft spot for bastards just like him ~ ~ the other guy barely lasted ten months . 
  edit : love the downvotes , renzi fanboys ? 
  basically , it 's just a new law allowing quick ( by italian standards , obviously ) divorces within a year of one party filing the request - which become 6 months if the both of yous want to do so . 
  compared to the 3 years and counting of the old system , it 's an unprecedented step forward ... truuuly worthy of las vegas ' seediest chapels , i say !, 
  it 's * congressional backstabbing 101 * , really - tell an opponent you 'll do something for them , have them pass your laws and when it 's your turn ... have your guys elect as president somebody who 's totally not cool with the party of your former `` ally '' ( all of this with the complicity of some of the opponent 's own men , thus creating a rift in his own party ) . 
  i hope i got that right , more or less ... 
  they 've got to start somehow ... production will likely increase over time . 
  yeah , looks can be deceiving ... `` babyface '' is not that stupid actually , just think about the ( brutal ) way he got rid of berlusconi !, 
  even though i do n't like him in the least , i too recognise that he can pull some truly machiavellian shit . 
  not everybody 's able to take out a seasoned shark twice his age !, 
  i understand where you 're coming from , but the army 's chemical branch just came first ( we 're talking about the 1800s here ... ) so there was no need for us to have yet another state-owned entity - and we got many !, 
  - doing the exact same thing . 
  as far as money is concerned , i still think this to be the solution that works best for us , also because we 've already got all the personnel/equipment/raw materials we may need ; nationalising a company or relying on private entrepreneurs ` because of an emergency ' may be a tad bit too costly , or turn out to be a process too slow . 
  on a second thought , it 's not ... if pharmaceutical companies found themselves for a reason or another ( embargoes , wars , disasters , whatever else might ever happen ) unable to continue production , there 'd be always the army 's own chemical plant . 
  and should someone attack the country with a chem/biological substance the corporations do n't have a cure readily available for , there 's always the army 's own stuff as some kind of fall-back plan . 
  not to mention the fact that soldiers can be issued the state-produced drugs , thus letting the afore-mentioned private companies concentrate on the civilian market ; this way one can minimise a shortage of such essential goods . 
  because its chemical establishment is secure enough and has all the equipment/experience already available - not to mention the fact that it is owned directly by the state , so there 's no relying on private corporations . 
  and it 's not like the government is doing this for free , in return they 're getting some cash back ... a future state monopoly on these kind of drugs would be indeed a desirable thing imho . 
  they usually come with toilet paper and when you get home you can clean yourself properly , yes . 
  however , schools and other public buildings ( \\* cough * army barracks \\* cough * ) are notoriously lacking in that department - what colleagues would do is to make a whip-round in order to buy some tp , since the government could n't care less . 
  some do , most do n't ... 
  yeah , but , you brits do n't have bidets to begin with ... 
  mmmmh , nope ? 
  at least ours do n't . 
  got ta say that i 'm all for this . 
  it 's a win-win , any way you look at it - patients in need can get their drugs from a trusted source at decent prices , the state gets some cash out of it and the dealers might even get less money . 
  btw - first a truly modern law on divorce and now this ... are our politicians actually proving useful ? 
  they can speak the local dialect . 
  it 's an interesting contrast , even compared to other european countries ; i 've noticed that in france or britain you 've got , say , 2nd/3d generation descendants of immigrants who still seem to speak french/english with whatever accent of the place their family comes from . 
  over here , in my experience , it 's just the opposite - they soon get * our * own accents and mannerisms while forsaking theirs ... they get * truly * assimilated . 
  what is really nice is that in 25 years we could be just as poor as ukraine . 
  was it a promotional video for that girl 's ass ? 
  actually , no - that rumour too is unproved ( and likely unfounded ) . 
  indeed it is . 
  the others are `` bastard '' , `` greedy '' and `` indulgent wastrel '' . 
   why so sad , hungary ? 
  they have nothing to eat ... 
  here 's my attempt ... ** russia ** would probably be the dim-witted , but large and aggressive , school bully ; ukraine - his deskmate - had the misfortune of having to share the same desk as him and no matter how much she complains about russia trying to put his dirty hands under her skirt , the teacher wo n't allow her to change seats . 
  the ** baltics ** are seated in the row in front of russia and they too are mildly unconfortable around him , especially since the guy 's got a penchant for throwing rubbers and pencils at their backs ; but he 's also stolen their lunches more than once . 
  ** estonia ** likes very much finland 's style , and is always trying to dress just like him . 
  ** poland ** is seated a few rows away ... she 's a moody , somewhat paranoid teenager but this should not surprise , given the fact that she 's seen some tough shit and her family was quite dysfunctional . 
  however , after having being taken into a loving foster home , her ways have become more and more relaxed and now she 's all grown up - meaning that the other boys too arestarting to see her in `` a different way '' , if you catch the drift . 
  much to russia 's displeasure . 
  ** czechia ** is the fedora'ed resident atheist , and apparently had some sort of ` meaningful ' relationship with ** slovakia ** . 
  but the pair ended up being bored with their story and have parted ways - they now see each other as friends and nothing more . 
  ** france ** is the kind of buxom , long-legged and rather attractive girl all the males in the classroom are lusting after ; everybody ogles at her rack , and whenever she smokes a cigarette she makes sure to do that sexy thing with the smoke . 
  but deep inside she 's somewhat insecure , and because of that she tries to be noticed every time . 
  she 's also starting to fancy germany , but he really needs to polish his manners as his first attempts at courting her were definitely a lil ' bit too rough . 
  ** britain ** , the cocky jock other males resent , is still in love ( albeit he will never admit it - not even to himself ! ), 
  with france but has n't managed to get over their break-up ... and is precisely because of that of he pretends not to like her anymore , sometimes by openly mocking her in front of his friends . 
  ** finland ** is the only guy who 's dared steep up to russia when he demanded his lunch , but got beaten nevertheless ; yet , he set an example for the others to follow . 
  an emo kid , he does n't have many friends and is just content sitting alone the last desk near the wall , careful not piss russia off as he 's now seated at the desk next to him . 
  ** sweden ** is quite the high-school feminist and does n't waste a chance to complain about `` the patriarchy '' and `` male oppression '' , even though she does n't quite understand what she 's talking about . 
  despite her best efforts to appear as a plain jane , she 's still quite the stunner and gets perved on by the other boys - much to her chagrin !, 
  ** denmark ** , however , just finds her unsufferable and would rather ask norway out ( if only had the courage ... something which netherlands always tries to sell him , despite denmark being still underage ) . 
  and as far as ** netherlands ** is concerned , he should really stop trying to introduce pornographic magazines and weed inside the classroom . 
  he got scolded for `` inadvertedly '' destroying italy 's nice drawings once . 
  ** norway ** is the class ' very own daddy 's girl and likes hanging around with ** switzerland ** , who 's just as wealthy as she is - however , the latter is rumoured to be some kind of cleptomaniac and the other peers do n't trust her that much .
