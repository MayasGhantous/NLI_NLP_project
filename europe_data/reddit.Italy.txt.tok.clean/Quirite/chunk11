  she feels so lonely , but is lusting right after ... ... ** italy ** , the resident bad-boy and class clown who 's totally , like , her exact opposite . 
  there literally could n't be a worst match but somehow she still ( secretly ) likes him , despite her appearing to disparage him every single time . 
  italy , on the other hand , just thinks her to be a pretentious - and rather stuck-up - rich airhead and is too busy messing around with the other girls to care about his own grades , something which more often than not has gotten him in trouble ( the teachers even wrote his parents a concerned letter ) . 
  speaking of whom , mum and dad are quite religious but he could n't care less to their horror ; and in the past he got in a couple of fights with austria but the two tolerate each other now ... even though austria often complains to the teacher about italy not wanting to give his pencils back . 
  italy 's sitting right next to ** spain ** , the funny cousin from another town , but has literally no idea of * slo-who ? 
  * and * cro-what ? 
  * might be even though they sit at the desk right next to his . 
  ** portugal ** is basically italy in disguise ( only much sadder , quieter and nostalgic ) . 
  he 's lost his favourite pet and boy , wo n't he stop weeping about it !, 
  if the country was a student , he 'd be the guy playing * wonderwall * at parties . 
  ** serbia ** is an amateur film-maker , but when he showed his * opera prima * to the class everybody had to puke . 
  he really does n't like kebap , no matter how it 's served !, 
  ** croatia ** and ** slovenia ** seem to fear him and his impressive collection of knives , which he 's said to have ` shown ' them once ; he 's also got a younger sis , ** montenegro ** , who once entered a * very * personal union with italy in his car 's backseat . 
  ** bulgaria ** sees people , goes to places ; but you would n't see him that much outside school ... ** austria ** was the one who spiked germany 's drink at a party just because he wanted to see his bro making a fool of himself ; but everybody ended up regretting it . 
  he 's still bff with ** germany ** , though , who gets a lot of flak for being the teacher 's favourite and for having snitched on poor ** greece ** - whose family just got kicked out of their apartment , mind you - while he was cheating his way through an exam . 
  notwithstanding his nice and jovial appearance , he 's got a dark past the other kids are afraid of ; but he 's totally chill now , or so he says . 
  ( poland did n't quite appreciate his rather straight-forward , drunken avances ) . 
  ** san marino ** feels neglected , but has been mistakenly punched once or twice while walking on a brawl . 
  ** romania ** wants to be cool , looks p to france and italy and tries to imitate their fashion ... if only his parents gave him more money !, 
  but he 's catching up . 
  ** hungary ** really does n't like the guy , though , because of an old story of when he left a toy on his table and romania took it without its permission claiming that it was his ; hungary tried to take it back but the teacher awarded it to the other kid , then took it back again , only to finally give it to romania - much to hungary 's displeasure !, 
  then russia came , demanded their lunches and beat them up anyway . 
  ** belgium ** gets constantly made fun of by netherlands for the perpetually-sorry state his shoes but he 's a swell guy , as long as he remembers to take his meds ; if he does n't , there 's the concrete risk of him getting possessed by two different personalities . 
  once he disapperared for a couple hundred of days and was found alone in the woods , not having eaten anything in the meantime - how he survived , it 's a mystery . 
  ** turkey ** , a kid from the other class , just wants to be part of the group . 
  but armenia once showed everybody her bruises and told it was his fault - something which he denies fervently . 
  this caused a few problems with the head-master , who wo n't let him change classroom until he apologises . 
  are you really sure romania was the only country that did n't ? 
  because we do n't , either . 
  we just ` celebrate ' a controversial change in government every 2nd of june , otherwise we 'd have to hi-jack the festivities for st. patrick 's in honour of the proclamation of the kingdom of italy ( which took place on 17 march ) . 
   i think the most popular one is the one involving one 's dead relatives that 's a pretty popular pastime in rome , as well ( not just romania ) . 
  in this moment , i am euporic ... 
  the ol' fountain at piazza di spagna . 
  we had just finished restoring it ... 
  well , uhm , at least we have n't smashed someone else 's artistic heritage on purpose ... you know . 
  andy vagina ? 
  what ? 
  as shitty as the situation currently is , i do n't think the libyans would appreciate . 
  neither they , nor our coffers . 
  you 'd be hard pushed to spot a person in my neighbourhood , let alone an earth-worm . 
  well , i too would n't have followed them to libya tbh . 
   king juan carlos killed drunk and pregnant bears well , those bears certainly were n't going to be responsible parents anyway . 
  i 'm not the most knowledgeable person on tuscan , umbrian or other central italian dialects - i 've only been studying the one in my city , and as far as it is concerned it still uses the letter j ; therefore any map detailing the extent of that dialect could very well do ( such as [ this one ] ( http://www.zingarate.com/pictures/20140702/mappa-dialetti.png ) ) . 
  and thank you for taking the time to update it !, 
  edit : as far as could gather from wikipedia - yeah , i know !, 
  - the other dialects of latium , umbria and central/southern marches ( map [ here ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/dialetti_italiani_centrali.jpg/250px-dialetti_italiani_centrali.jpg= ) ) seem to make use of that letter in a way similar to that of romanesco , its apperance in words such as * cavaju * [ ka ` vayoo ] ( `` horse '' ) being rather common . 
  but , again , i 'm not an expert . 
  the guy on the right looks * dead * serious . 
  we do n't have one . 
  yet . 
  but libya , on the other hand ... \\* wink wink nod nod *, 
  italian too * used * to have a letter j , but we 've looong done away with it and have ( mostly ) replaced it with i. 
  the letter 's simply not used anymore except for certain names , brands , loan-words and whatnot ... 
  yes , but aspi is for those who have been employed * regularly * , something which ( as you certainly will know ) is not a given in this country . 
  what 's in for all those young people who , like me , have never held a ` proper ' job ? 
  if i ca n't seem to get one in the first place , what could i possibly ever get out of the system ? 
   [ ... ] deals targeting italy surged more than 400 percent year-on-year to a total value of $ 19.3 billion [ ... ] of course they have , everybody can now get what 's left of our companies for peanuts . 
  but apart from this i still think that renzi is the supposedly-left-wing equivalent of berlusconi ( minus the sex life ) - all talk and no action !, 
  at least ( as far as i could understand ) you can get something out of the system !, 
  here even if you register , all the state does is to put you in contact with those ( few ) companies that are actually still hiring and there 's no guarantee they 'll take you ; you do n't even have the right to get discounted medical care , to be eligible one either needs to have been * legally * employed before * and * to have been without a job for the last 2 years ... or belong to a family with an impossibly-low income . 
  other than that , you 're literally on your own . 
  i do n't know , either . 
  over here we do n't have much in the way of unemployment benefits , and many people simply choose not to register within the job centre system because they know it 's so useless - thus skewing the data ... 
   but , your jobless do n't look for jobs so much . 
  we do n't ? 
  really ? 
  what about the fact that pretty much nobody is hiring or wants to hire nowadays ? 
  speaking from personal experience ... got laid off , sent a few hundred cvs , got just three/four interviews over a period of nine months and here i am - still unemployed . 
  and to think i had to drop university to keep working !, 
  italy is in the shitter right now . 
  i 've also applied for a few public exams but did n't make it ; both temporary employment agencies ( etjca , randstad , workexperience , you name it - i 've tried them all ) and the government 's job centres are equally as useless . 
  so no , my impression is that there really is n't anything to do but to pack up and go somehwere else while renzi keeps saying that everything 's swell and fine and that we 'll eventually - * when * , it 's a mystery - recover ... ... in the meantime , the chinese and germans are buying up what 's left of our industries . 
  we 're damn fine , are n't we ? 
  i 'm so proud of being right down there with belarus and russia !, 
  fyi that one 's been abolished in 1999 . 
  it seems like / u/happyrectangle did n't get this part right ... actually the roman dialect does use the letter j and with a certain regularity , too - something which is indeed pronunced as the y in `` yes '' ( the city and its environs should have thus been couloured as purple on the map ) . 
  * fijo * , * pajata * , * gajardo * , * cojone * [ ko ` yone ] are only a few of the words with that letter ... and our dialect 's rife with them !, 
  edit : i think that the other central italian dialects ( those of the marches , or umbria ) might use it as well . 
   italy   penalisation ( s ) : blasphemy this report is outdated - indeed , the very ( common ) act of uttering blasphemies was decriminalised in 1999 , and even before that date the law was seldom applied or else the police should 've fined pretty much everybody ... ... possibly including themselves !, 
  `` one euro a day keeps the russkies away '', 
  have n't i already seen that model in * mafia * ? 
   [ ... ] the more recent ships did not find much success here . 
  are you referring to the fremms ? 
  or the new horizon-class ? 
  wannabe armchair general here . 
  i 'm a bit skeptical of this programme - while the navy could certainly use some more upgrades , i still think that the bulk of the investments should have gone to the army instead . 
  ( time to retire those sidams !, 
  it 's an omen !, 
  actually , central africa under bokassa or idi amin 's uganda * may * have been a tad bit worse . 
   what did italy do wrong ? 
   not much ... but the ussr-backed dictators who overthrew their post-independence governments did . 
  as well as the us and france , who first bombed libya to shit in the hope that the new government would 've been just as friendly towards them than it had been with eni , and when they got nuffin ' out of it they left the mess we know today . 
  \\* tinfoil hat off * and actually - both somalia and eritrea were n't even that bad before the war ; as far as the sorry state of today 's eritrea is concerned , i think you can blame the british and the ethiopians for it !, 
  as well as that afewerki dude . 
  the uniform in the first pic looks so fake !, 
  did he make it with a carpet or what ? 
  italy ca n't into eurovision . 
  that 's right guys , we 're warming up for the great leap backwards !, 
  i 'll tell you what , it 's all [ this guy 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp8fkrd2kja ) very own fault . 
  the dude 's a walking stereotype ... and the japanese like him .
