  not enough . 
  oh , a little green man . 
  wait ... 
  no , i mean the [ vatican gendarmerie ] ( http://insidethevatican.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/gendarmeria-x.jpg ) - the * carabinieri * have no jurisdiction there . 
  dude i have obviously earned enough xp points to digi-evolve into my current , white form . 
   [ ... ] vatican city still has some of the crusade knight orders as its defence agencies . 
  i 'm afraid that this claim can be considered dubious , at best . 
  afaik the knights of malta do cooperate with the * italian * army , and there 's no such thing as a vatican military : that of italy is responsible for the city-state 's defence ( the swiss guards being ` just ' the pope 's very own security detail , while the gendarmerie performs police duties ) . 
  nowhere to be found , and this is also the reason as to why the king of italy was n't present as well : both were not related to the recently-deceased monarch , and a telegram would have probably been considered enough on their part . 
  actually conscription in italy has n't been abolished - just suspended . 
  it 's still better than the shit they pass on tv , though . 
  everybody watches rai 1 ... but only because it 's the first channel you skip after having turned the telly on !, 
  tv here is utter shite - only our geriatric audience could possibly enjoy it , and i 'm not even sure if they * really * do . 
  probably i 'd opt for primogeniture with the laws of the kingdom , as well as crown authority , set to `` high '' . 
  but i do n't think the ~ ~ vassals ~ ~ other members would appreciate it . 
  now , where does one sign up ... ? 
  upvoted because of the special effects . 
  is there any popular support for the restoration of the romanian monarchy ? 
  ... and not just one , but * three !, 
  serbia ca n't into ( air ) space ? 
  or you could just apply one of the two pieces on your forehead and pretend to be teal ` c. 
  ssssh ... how dare you doubt of his manliness , not to speak of the unquestionable gun-slinging skills he 's mastered in years of gorilla warfare ? 
  do you not realise he 's gon na kill us all ? 
  to him we 're nothing but just another target !, 
  wait a sec ... we 're green too !, 
  * we 're green tooooo !, 
  his first book . 
  ca n't say he 's that much better now ... 
  sounds like someone 's been reading dan brown !, 
   [ ... ] english was the one language the vatican had not yet embraced [ ... ] they considered english a polluted , free-thinker 's language for profane men like chaucer and shakespeare . 
  \\ - that very same scribbler , * angels and demons *, 
  it needs a [ white cat ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/blofeldpleasance67.jpg ) . 
  it means that there 's no such thing as slovenia , obviously . 
  is it just me or does that merkava look like something a goa'uld would use ? 
  you still wish you had one , though ... ... even if it came with a broomstick . 
  and it 's been made by the government , at that !, 
  who would 've ever thought ... 
  it saddens me to no end how old buildings ( and i mean the * really * old ones , not the commieblocks ... ) are being torn down to make space for new developments in bucharest . 
  i 'd like to see something along the lines of warsaw 's reconstruction , so as to give the city at least some of its pre-war lustre back ; but who knows if this is possible . 
  needs more ivan drago . 
  according to regional law n. 21/2006 ( which is still in force ) yes , it is . 
  the text of the law in q. can be found here : www.comune.roma.it/pcr/resources/cms/documents/lrlazion21_06.pdf . 
  have a good , hard look at art . 
  where 's eritrea ? 
  and why is libya german ? 
   a european missionary 's map of africa * `` the wells missionary map co. , 3612 prairie avenue , chicago '' * does n't look all that european to me . 
  i doubt it . 
  renzi dealt a serious blow to what was left of his party by electing another candidate of his own choice for president ; moreover , politically speaking belusconi 's pretty much dead and has never truly recovered from 2011 . 
  not even the northern league wants to associate with him anymore , an eventual comeback is imho out of question . 
  vladi 's coming-out party , of course !, 
  it 's gon na be * fabulous * . 
  as i 've already written in another thread , f35s are going to replace the three older models ( harrier ii , amx ghibli , panavia tornado ) currently in service with our navy and air force - which , in addition to having become quite obsolete , have reached the very end of their life-cycle and whose spare parts are expensive , incompatible with each other or simply not in stock anymore . 
  these aircraft 's maintenance is , perhaps unsurprisingly , quite costly nowadays and the few times it 's not is because a number of them has to be grounded and ` cannibalised ' in order to get those parts . 
  this said , i hope the plane in the photo 's unpainted ... otherwise that 's truly one ugly fucker . 
  could be both things , actually . 
  well , but it 's not like most italians are * that * hairy to begin with ... 
  it 's exactly because it was made by our lovely neighbours that we wo n't be buying any . 
  no , as far as i know ... perhaps some metrosexual hipster , certainly not your average joe . 
  such as ... ? 
  keep in mind that money is n't the only factor , but the very fact that f35s would be assembled here ( thus creating more jobs , partially reviving the economy ... as well as finally making use of local expertise instead of letting it emigrate to other countries ) was decisive - something which probably would n't have happened , had we chosen another jet . 
  that aircraft will replace three older models ( harrier ii , amx ghibli , panavia tornado ) and their relative shoot-offs which , in addition to having become quite obsolete , have reached the very end of their life-cycle ... and whose spare parts are expensive , incompatible or simply not in stock anymore . 
  their maintenance is thus quite costly , and the few times it 's not is because a number of aircrafts has to be grounded and ` cannibalised ' in order to get those . 
   * northern * italy is fact a very advanced patch of land [ ... ] hey !, 
  it 's not like the rest of the peninsula is made of illiterate peasants , either . 
  to give you some examples - here in rome we 've got the [ enea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enea_%28italy%29 ) , which does some pretty interesting stuff ; maccarese ( near fiumicino ) is home to the * international plant genetic resources institute * ( now [ bioversity international ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bioversity_international ) ) ; the mountains of abruzzo host the state-of-the-art [ laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laboratori_nazionali_del_gran_sasso ) , and so on and on and on ... 
  i 'd suggest some sharks with friggin ' lasers beams attached to their heads instead . 
  there are worse things around , though . 
  if i had a penny for every time i 've scoffed at the portrayal of ` italy ' in foreign films , i 'd be filthy rich ... 
  whoa , speak for yourself dude ... :-), 
  to be more precise , trieste has never been part of an independent slovenian state - considering that it was administered by the * free territory of trieste * under un supervision and then re-incorporated within italy . 
  you take that back !, 
  only a dastardly french would ever eat that cardboard-tasting thing you 've got over there ... ^ ^ ^ / s the chocolate-filled * cornetto * is the best invention in history right after the wheel , democracy and mia khalifa 's videos . 
   [ ... ] lithuanian murderers are a common thing abroad yeah , i had heard of that hannibal dude ... 
  1890 to 1949 , and then a u.n. trust ( always administered by italy ) until 1960 ... not exactly '15 minutes ' if you ask me . 
  this reminds me of one certain scene from * a clockwork orange * ... 
  land invasions now 20 % faster !, 
  yeah , these times you 've got to make do ... 
  well , mussolini may have dreamed of a new roman empire ... ... looks like we 've gotten a romanian one instead . 
  same thing here , in most mountainous areas ( abruzzo comes to mind ) there are n't gas pipes but canisters . 
  when it 's finished , you bring it back in order to get a full one . 
  rome can not into quality ... 
  fantastic , even slovenia 's ahead of us !, 
  ^ ^ ^ / s and to think that just 20 years ago we were among the biggest car exporters ... 
  these romanians ' cars had probably been targeted either by one or more unknown arsonists ( who recently wroke havoc all around town ) or by loan sharks - an hypothesis which becomes suddenly far more plausible when you learn that the families affected by the burnings have refused , for some reason , to press charges ... another theory is that these people might actually have been involved in something less than legal . 
  hope a patch comes out soon . 
  all 25 of them ? 
  unbelievable . 
  god gave the fog to the milanese so that not even they would have to look at their own city . 
  infinite mercy indeed . 
  her majesty would definitely benefit from a thorough defrag . 
  oh great , thank you sooo much for having forgotten * central * italy ... 
  suggestion : restore the casino in constan\u021ba and turn the whole town into romania 's very own , vat-free montecarlo . 
  it worked here . 
  hey !, 
  * central * italy 's got some pharma and automotive industries as well . 
  latina might be a shithole but it 's a high-tech one ... 
  1 ) i do n't even know what they look like , the only clue of their existence being them using our lift ; once i caught one of those guys while he was nailing something down at 11 pm ( wtf ?! ) . 
  the rest of the condo is made up by rich arseholes who refuse to pay for communal heating and take up all the parking spots ... they can burn in hell . 
  3 ) the gubmint 's gon na need a korea-style gulag if it wants to re-educate such a bunch of cunts anyhoo !, 
  & nbsp ;  [ ... ] the majority of the c\u00f4te d'azur have never been italian speaking [ ... ] & nbsp ; nizza , mentone and their environs certainly were before the annexations of 1860 and the following exodus .
