   [ ... ] there is always a judge in berlin actually , the saying translates more properly as `` there * has * to be a judge in berlin !, 
  no shit !, 
  who would 've ever thought ? 
  anyhoo , it does n't take a genius to understand how renzi is nothing short of a snake-oil salesman . 
  he 's a chip off the old block - and by `` old block '' i really mean silvio berlusconi , with whom that very scumbag happens to have a lot in common ( save for the extravagant sex life ) . 
  just why ? 
  or how ? 
  i would n't be so sure about that ... not only they depend on the mainland for just about everything but the island has already gotten its fair share of cash/autonomy . 
  and if sardinians were to become non-citizens then i 'm pretty sure we would lose a good 30 % of all the personnel in the army/carabinieri/gdf !, 
  no , the * coperto * is actually an ( illegal ) extra charge ; personnel costs are already factored in the prices . 
  i 'm afraid that 's the case of public aqueducts as well ; i knew that sardinia itself was kinda short on water but i 've also just read that the one most towns actually get is n't of good quality because of the chemicals that can be found in it . 
  and the low levels in the reservoirs ( which get even lower during summer ) allow for a bigger concentration of those ... 
  apparently the water 's not safe ... but i do n't know why ( yet ) . 
  imho the tap water in rome is * infinitely * superior to any bottled water there might be ; no contest !, 
  & nbsp ;  do people in your country buy bottled water for home use ? 
  & nbsp ; rarely , unless you live in certain places ( like sardinia or some parts of the countryside ) where it 's not drinkable . 
  & nbsp ;  how about in a restaurant ? 
  & nbsp ; we do , but purely 1 ) out of habit and 2 ) because restaurateurs here are unwilling to provide anything for free . 
  hell in most italian regions - latium is an exception - you must pay for the privilege of having to sit down ... let alone water !, 
  ok , that 's a fair point . 
  i 'm not a native english speaker , and it shows ...  [ ... ] if lewis hamilton himself were on a pubic road [ ... ] aaaall riiight . 
  but i do n't think you can drive on a landing strip anyway !, 
  yeah , anas does take care of the * autostrade * . 
  but most local roads are the responsibility of the regional government ... 
  naples is the exception to everything , though . 
  i 'd say no , most of us are n't actually bad drivers ( quite the opposite ... as far as skills are concerned ) . 
  but , but , * but * - we 're reckless . 
  and selfish . 
  what is worse , people see nothing wrong with that !, 
  i suspect that an excellent healthcare system is kinda easy to achieve when you 're swimming in petrodollars . 
  and having a rich , absolute government that does n't have to worry about labour unions or budget cuts helps a lot ... 
  here in latium we do n't need the mafia to make our motorways look terrible ... astral 's already taking care of that . 
  think of comcast ( just with roads ) . 
  i must point out that the traffic here is not quite the kind of lawless chaos a foreigner would expect ; there 's some logic behind it . 
  actually , it sort of works like a well-oiled machine as motorists * usually * know their place in the flow . 
  believe it or not most of us make it home in one piece ... the poor state of many local roads is a far bigger danger !, 
  somehow i 'm convinced this is none of sweden 's business ... 
  sicily already has a large degree of autonomy ... which its local government has been eagerly squandering for some 70 years now . 
  the region has utterly failed to get on par with the others despite all the support , and is probably the only one in which taking away said autonomy would be entirely justified . 
  the sicilians themselves are well aware of this . 
  if anything they might want the government to * revoke * its special status !, 
  dude , we 're talking about something that 1 ) happened almost a thousand years ago ; 2 ) is only very loosely related to the concept of ` padania ' as it is posited by the league and 3 ) the average italian hardly gives a fuck about anyway . 
  there is simply no homogeneous , monolithic northern bloc to speak of and the fictitious geopolitical entity conceived by the nl has just as much legitimacy as sealand or ruritania . 
  so while scotland , catalonia , the veneto and the like are all very real places padania , on the other hand , definitely is not - and i am quite certain the * leghisti * too know this . 
  if there was a real claim and the actual will to secede , the party would n't have discarded the idea so easily ... 
   when i was there most people of venice ( the ones who capable of talking english ) do n't see themselves as italian . 
  such a detached attitude is relatively common here , but it should not be taken seriously . 
  the venetian independence movements are a complete joke though - and so was the ~ ~ internet poll ~ ~ ` referendum ' . 
  mmmh ... while a few people might have actually bought into it , the northern league 's * real * selling points were them being against two things : taxpayers ' money being redistributed to the poorer southern regions and immigration . 
  it could be argued that the second point in itself has always been the main reason behind their popularity !, 
   [ ... ] the only regions that really have an independent movement are veneto [ ... ] actually those movements are just too small and fragmented to achieve anything ; quite the joke if you ask me . 
  besides they seem to capitalise more on a generic opposition to taxes/immigration , rather than independence ...  [ ... ] the whole north [ ... ] you sure about that ? 
  i mean , ` padania ' is not a real entity - and has never been !, 
  it was just a gimmick by the northern league to get more visibility and votes . 
  are n't all those russian girls enough of an incentive ? 
  reeepooost ... btw this does n't actually have anything to do with terrorism ; renzi 's just doing another electoral gimmick of his . 
  ***** edit : and with `` investing in security '' he actually means to find enough money so as to raise the salary of all those poor , * totally * over-worked souls that are our heroic traffic cops ( and hopefully get some votes in return ) . 
  the bastard . 
  yeah , but keep in mind that berlusconi himself is actually a by-product of the socialist party !, 
  he was the dauphin and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the party 's secretary ... that 's how the guy got started . 
  i see . 
  so i guess the closest thing we 've got to a ` truly ' left-wing party is [ sel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/left_ecology_freedom ) - they 're the ones pushing for reforms on immigration , citizenship , civil unions , adoptions and whatnot . 
  but they make for a fairly minor force in parliament so that 's the reason as to why they 've chosen to ally with the [ pd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_party_%28italy%29 ) , italy 's current ~ ~ single ~ ~ ruling party ...  tho they sadly have betrayed allot of their values soooo yea ... ... aaand the same can be said about the pd , especially since mr. renzi has taken power !, 
  it 's more of a catch-all party with no particular ideology behind it . 
  really ? 
  ours collapsed around 1991/2 , along with most other parties . 
  it was the end of an era !, 
  both the socialist and communist parties are looong defunct . 
  thankfully , i might add ... 
  my two pence on the matter : * sicily - the island 's got autonomy and a fair share of money , most of which gets promptly wasted by the local government ( s ) . 
  having seen the impressive results achieved so far people are * hardly * clamouring for more power . 
  * `` padania '' - what is this , 1996 ? 
  besides there has never been something akin to a `` padanian '' identity . 
  as for the reason as to why foreign journalists keep falling for that ( dated ) load of horseshit , it 's a mystery : the northern league was just pushing for more monies !, 
  the whole thing about ` independence ' being pure propaganda ... something all italians with a brain had seen through . 
  a padanian ` nationalist ' would be met with jeers . 
  of course - but their local culture certainly does n't make them appear ` foreign ' to me . 
  well , but ... naples is the exception to everything !, 
   [ ... ] italian is practically a second language to italians due to their own individual regional cultures ; the italian language is n't even the language many people speak in many regions of italy , at least it 's not the language they think in . 
  [ ... ] & nbsp ; now now , while the situation can vary from region to region even then we all do ... things , speak and think in italian . 
  source : was an italian teen , am an italian adult !, 
  & nbsp ;  [ ... ] when italians are exposed to another region 's culture , it can be like visiting another country for them [ ... ] & nbsp ; again , it depends on the place you 're in but even in that case the whole thing about the country 's actual diversity is kind of overblown . 
  most of italy definitely * does n't * feel foreign to me , a roman ... places like the abruzzi , umbria or tuscany are hardly any different from latium - we 've got the same things , same language , same sheepshaggers . 
  but areas like alto adige or the val d'aosta or , to a lesser extent , sardinia make for a different story . 
  that 's true !, 
  afaik they * do * have a beef with us ( after all italians are a favourite of the local party ) but usually we do n't reciprocate ... 
  i mean , a good chunk of us does n't give a fuck and the other half ca n't point ticino on a map !, 
  unless of course that very party comes up with that [ wonderful propaganda of theirs ] ( http://www.ilprimoamore.com/old/imgpost/ratti.jpg ) - then the public gets all worked up and outraged for five minutes before promptly moving on and getting incensed at something ( or someone ) else . 
  tbh i was expecting it to be ticino ... was not disappointed !, 
  it 'd still be worth it . 
  good to know !, 
  i think i 'll accidentally ` lose ' mine anyway ... 
  i look 14 on that photo !, 
  does it ? 
  they never asked me for one and that space is taken up by a stamp . 
  mine is from 2009 , though . 
  what 's the point of a nucular torpedo anyway ? 
  you mean it 's not a theory espoused almost exclusively by a fringe of whingy , or otherwise uninformed , people sharing a political alignment ? 
  not only that 's * literally * some northern league-level bullshit ( probably conceived as a response to it ) , but all those ` works ' dealing with the matter are neither 1 ) written by historians nor 2 ) peer-reviewed . 
  unsurprisingly they have no place in academia ... and if you or your prof buy into that drivel , well , it 's your problem .
