  awful ? 
  awful ?!, 
  you take that back , chocolate-filled cornetti are just the best !, 
  i 'm not a frenchie and i 'm * so * not gon na have some cardboard for breakfast ... 
  not particularly , at least here in rome . 
  the only ( truly ) local sweets we can boast are * pangiallo * and * maritozzi * but i have n't seen those in a looong time !, 
  personally i happen to be torn beween multiple delicacies ; my favourites would be either horse beef or * fegato alla veneziana * ( pork liver with baby onions ) . 
  another , * very * particular dish i enjoyed very much is * animelle * ( sweet-bread ) . 
  if you 're brave enough you might also want to try veal brain - it 's so light it literally melts in your mouth !, 
  have you guys already forgotten who 's heavily influenced your beloved cuisine first ? 
  if it were n't for caterina de ' medici and the thousands of courtiers she brought with her , there would be no modern french gastronomy to speak of ... :-), 
  you * do * know that the eu is n't a country but rather 27 separate states trying to push their own agendas , right ? 
  :-p edit : what you guys see as a shockingly pro-russian stance is regarded as a reasonable defence of our very own interests here . 
  do n't forget that the sanctions you 've fought so much for have bitten , hard ... and not just russia . 
  you might also be ( un ) surprised to learn that russophilia has long become a right-wing affair !, 
  our history with russia is nothing new , though , they 've always been an important commercial and diplomatical partner of ours . 
  anyhoo - lately we 've been focusing more on its up-and-coming ( not to mention resource-rich ) neighbours such as azerbaijan , kazakhstan , turkmenistan , uzbekistan ... we should proceed in that direction imho . 
   am i right ? 
  yeah , you surely are . 
  never seen a wooden building here ( except for those tacky garden sheds people like so much ) . 
  our closest equivalent would be the half-timbered homes in the alps but as the name suggests , they 're only partly made of wood ... 
  yes . 
  if only to make our lives slightly more bearable ... 
  surely i must 've heard about that woman somewhere else ? 
  i bet this one loon is n't new to such things ... 
  it 's basically italian with the genders reversed !, 
  you still have lol , though . 
  i think it 's a nice series - albeit there 's very little in the way of spoken language ... 
  good ol' * central * italy !, 
  thanks for reminding the world of our existence . 
  as we use to say whenever a northerner gets a bit too fond of himself ... 
  [ * pbbbbbbbbbbt !, 
  * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vehxvzmeiyu ), 
  milan used to have one , though . 
  and so did naples ( until 1980 ) therefore you guys are by no means an exception . 
  i might also add that the kind of * via milano * we got here leads straight into a rather smelly , loud and dark tunnel ... ... that 's some truly powerful imagery if you ask me . 
  as it 's already been noted almost every town here 's got a * via cavour * , * via garibaldi * , or a * via vittorio emanuele ii * ( most of the references to his successor were expunged after the war ) . 
  other common names i 've noticed include * via/corso umberto i * and * via roma * but streets dedicated to the first two queens are relatively easy to find as well . 
  every other town 's also guaranteed to have either a * via piave * ( the country 's main front in ww1 ) or a * via dante * . 
  & nbsp ; ** fun fact !, 
  ** mussolini decreed that every big and medium city have a main street dedicated to the capital in 1931 ... 
  oooh , so the vatican 's got lots of money ? 
  and their buildings do n't even pay local taxes ? 
  who would 've ever thought ... 
  they are n't even trying to hide the monies anymore , mind you !, 
  our relationship 's rock-solid . 
  probably san marino ... and if it was n't behaving so badly , russia . 
  nobody expects the spanish inquisition !, 
   so there is no active movements for independence right now in italy ? 
  no , no , i was not clear enough . 
  there actually * are * some separatist movements left but they 're small , irrelevant and often made fun of . 
  hell , most of these happen to be even more irrelevant than the monarchists are ( and i 'm one ! ) . 
  * the one in south tyrol used to be a real nuisance ( think of a slightly less deadly equivalent of the eta ) back in the day but now the province 's long been autonomous , it gets a whole load of public money/subsidies and many south tyroleans hold public jobs - so the movement has effectively been neutered . 
  oppression ? 
  hardly so . 
  * as for the valle d'aosta , they actually fought off a rather clumsy french attempt at annexation in 1944 and with the kind of statute they got shortly after , they certainly have little intention of leaving italy anytime soon - not least because the place 's almost completely italophone now and the use of french/patois is fairly limited . 
  * in sicily there used to be two strong independence movements between the latter stages of ww2 and 1947 . 
  the king graned the island autonomy but the new administration soon became a hotbed of inefficiency and corruption , while the place has n't improved that much ... a few have even considered revoking the statute !, 
   i heard there is a right-wing party in the north that wants the independence for the south , am i wrong ? 
  you mean the northern league ? 
  that separatist agenda they were ( or were not , see below ) pushing in the '90s had no basis whatsoever in either history and culuture . 
  unlike catalonia , which is a * real * entity with a culture and a people behind , padania was an artificial construct that encompassed all of the northern regions - which prior to the unification were a hodgepodge of different states with different dialects , cuisine , etc. 
  - even though their idea of ` north ' was quite fluid and rather incoherent at times . 
  it often even included central italian regions such as the marches . 
  the motivations for this were purely economic and parochial in nature , as all the league wanted was not seeing part of their precious tax money being redistributed among the other regions , particularly in the south . 
  their separatism was little more than smoke and mirrors ; needless to say , few took that proposal seriously ... not even the league itself . 
  when the old party leadership proved really no better than the sterotype of the corrupt southerner they despised so much ( the founder 's son - a real tool if there ever was one - did n't even finish high school but somehow got a degree in albania and a place in the regional administration ; he was also routinely given party money ; the party made deals with the * n'drangheta * etc. 
  etc. ), 
  in 2012 , the nl almost collapsed and the line was subsequently changed . 
  `` no more padania . 
  no more separatism ( not the real goal anyway ) . 
  no more shitting on southerners . 
  instead , let 's go get all those sweet southern votes by taking it out against dem evil immigrunts , gypos and moosleemz ! '' . 
  & nbsp ; edit : a last consideration . 
  it 's also worth noting that while catalonia or or navarra are fairly ` big ' entities their closest italian equivalents , except for the islands , are a bunch of tiny little provinces spread trougout the peninsula - each with its particular dialect , cuisine , customs and rivalries . 
  campaigning for their ` independence ' would make little sense . 
  & nbsp ; ** tl ; dr ** the northern league has * looong * become a generic , xenopobic right-wing party . 
  if there 's something i appreciate about my own country it 's the fact that any such initiative would very probably end up drowning in a sea of hysterical laughter and jeers ... to say the least . 
  other students would have a field day with it . 
  but seriously , what happened to anglos and their common sense ? 
  if those guys are anything like our politicians then they 're * so * not going to declare things . 
  after all , this still a ** local election ** , not a referendum , in which the winning parties are there because of a ** minority ** ; as far as independence is concerned that 's not much in the way of legitimacy ( no enough votes , so the results are hardly representative of the popular will ) at least because what mas plans to do is not only illegal but also something along the lines of me trying to declare the room i 'm in a sovereign nation . 
  and when confronted with the hardships an unilateral declaration would likely entail , either the whole alliance breaks ^ ** 1 ** or the guy steps down ... always assuming mr. mas actually manages to get elected as president , which is n't a given because something something political allies . 
  therefore 1 ) the current , shaky coalition will probably fall after a month or so of boisterous claims ; 2 ) there 'll be both local and national elections in which a similar , but a clearer scenario will emerge ; 3 ) the new local and national governments surely wo n't consist of people like mas and rajoy head-butting each other just for the pleasure of doing so . 
  more reasonable colleagues will hopefully take their place and start talks . 
  4 ) a middle ground will eventually be reached and catalonia will get a revised , expanded statute ... 
  even though they do n't get independence , the catalans will have brought the spanish state to its knees and forced it to listen to their demands , which is already a big step forward . 
  the very fact of there being talks will please most and the new agreement is going to please even more people except , of course , for the hard-liners . 
  & nbsp ; ** 1 ** - people have lives besides politics and politicians are people too ; regardless of their beliefs , both would n't probably risk the relative comfort of their lives for what is basically a scary leap in the dark with more cons than pros . 
  they also ca n't tell the rest of the world , or at the very least the bits that count the most , to fuck off either !, 
  debatable . 
  if our very own history , as well as the years spent getting bored to tears while being forced to read * the betrothed * , ever taught us anything ... is that even the plague itself was preferable to a spanish administration !, 
  still , they 've been damaged by the quakes . 
  nope , i was actually referring to [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ponte_principe_amedeo_savoia_aosta ) [ two . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ponte_giuseppe_mazzini ) if they close , half of rome is fucked . 
  no sarcasm involved - restorers really * did * clean and reinforce the monument 's facade ( special cements were used , and the old iron supports that were keeping certain stone elements together were replaced with a few more made of a particular titanium alloy ) . 
  as far as a thorough reconstruction of the colosseum is concerned , well ... this is kind of a minefield !, 
  and italian archaeologists tend to be veeery conservative in that regard , so . 
  pls gib job, 
  bullshit , the colosseum 's just been restored .
