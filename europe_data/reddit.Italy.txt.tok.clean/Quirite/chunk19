  we also have rednecks . 
  woah , that 's heavy . 
  and i thought we had it bad because there was no tp in the barracks and had to wipe with newspaper clippings ... 
  & nbsp ;  and those 100 soldiers who asked for humanitarian aid in italy & nbsp ; wait , what ... ? 
  when did that happen ?!, 
  anyway , at the very least they 're not ` tourists ' . 
  yeah ... too bad there were still plenty of italians in istria and nevermind such small trifles like , i dunno , the [ istrian exodus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istrian_exodus ) . 
  or the [ foibe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foibe_massacres ) . 
  what a swell guy tito was !, 
  sooo much better than the very fascists he was fighting against . 
  just to be even more clear they did some * truly * horrible stuff ; there 's no disputing that ... ... but so did the partisans , whose hands were no less bloody than those of the fascists . 
  personally i do n't find either party quite worthy of praise . 
  i just wanted to point out that we 're definitely * not * bankrupt and while our debt is , by all accounts , fairly massive it 's still in our very own hands . 
  in other words ... we 're not greece and if we were , europe would have already disintegrated a long long time ago . 
  not quite . 
  the provisions in the treaty of uccialli did not include a description of the new border and the tigr\u00e8 was an autonomous entity only formally subjected to the ethiopian emperor who , by the way , chose to take no part in the fight against the italians ; he only intervened when the local ruler ( an enemy of his ) ended up submitting to them . 
  the emperor then rounded a hundred thousand warriors and invaded ... 
  nope - believe it or not the ethiopians were the ones who actually invaded italian eritrea in 1895 !, 
  fyi italy invaded ethiopia in 1935 ... 
  absolutely , i do agree with you . 
  imho if you send 200.000 people among colonists , workers and soldiers , and give them plots of land , then you are in fact colonising a place . 
  but yes - it did n't last long and ethiopia was still recognised as a sovereign country , so the italian annexation was deemed illegal by the league of nations . 
  the country itself never ceased to exist ... ... hence the term occupation . 
  from a purely legal pov , ethiopia was occupied ; but it was also * de facto * colonised . 
  these two things are n't mutually exclusive . 
  ethiopia was actually colonised , even though the settlers only stayed for a few years and had to be forcefully evicted during [ a two-year guerrilla war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_guerrilla_war_in_ethiopia ) by both commonwealth and ethiopian troops . 
  hostilities finally ceased in mid 1943 . 
  as for eritrea - the place was ruled by the italians from 1890-1942 , then by the british between 1942 and 1952 ( but they left the old administration in place ) and was then `` federated '' with ethiopia , which proceeded to annex and occupy it until 1993 ... when it finally became independent after a decades-long ~ ~ bloodbath ~ ~ insurgency . 
  if there 's something wrong with the map 's portion of east africa that 's * british * somaliland !, 
  the pyramid is indeed ancient , but was completely restored in 2014 . 
  yes . 
  aurelianus wanted to cut corners and included the pyramid in the city walls . 
  that 's capitalism for you . 
  finding a job in it would n't be actually that much of a struggle from what i gather - this kind of degree being very sought after - but entry and mid-level positions are horribly underpaid by the standards of most western countries . 
  but what do i know ... 
  i 'm studying industrial chemistry !, 
  oh , i do n't hate you !, 
  :-) most employers here are small ( mum & pop kind of place ) to mid-sized companies and they would n't check those references anyway . 
  as long as you know what you 're doing , you 're golden . 
  they want cheap ... they get cheap . 
  and it 's not like i lie about the places i 've worked at or my position ; the devil is in the details , i just fuzz them . 
  fake it 'til you make it !, 
  the harsh truth is that nowadays , cvs need to be padded and/or stretched somewhat . 
  of course you ca n't lie about having a degree or being a coding genius just because you watched an episode of mr. 
  robot but * sliiightly * stretching dates/competences was what allowed me to land my second job , followed by a third one ... you need to get your foot on the ladder first . 
  by whatever means necessary . 
  then you can gain experience . 
  it helps not to go to uni immediately after graduation ; of all my friends who enrolled right after hs , not a single one of them has managed to land any job and none have any experience except for `` that week they worked at footlocker '' . 
  sadly i 'm the only one who managed to weasel his way into a job at age 18 and build a cv from there . 
  by age 25 you 're considered old and if all you got on your cv is fuck-all you 're unemployable !, 
  & nbsp ; ** tl ; dr ** competition in the ( asphyctic ) italian job market is * really * ruthless . 
  just some bald hothead by the name of mussolini or something . 
  so , ropes-on-the-sky ? 
  nope , afaik they 'd always been there . 
  they also speak an otherwise unintelligible language ... just like the welsh . 
  why does that sound familiar ? 
  ah , yes ... * `` back in the day * he * made the trains run on time , drained the marshes and built all those council houses ! '' . 
  i wonder why op chose the ugliest of trams ? 
  the [ older ones ] ( http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4091/4959989589_c7972f2234.jpg ) are much better than this ... thing . 
  these are so shitty they 've been quite literally cannibalised out of service . 
  * fert , fert , fert * ( pity , it was such a cool motto ... whatever it meant ) . 
  i have become a statistic ... again !, 
  i think it may depend on the place !, 
  afaik it 's co-official in pola but perhaps not in the other italian-speaking parts of the istrian peninsula , where it 's just recognised as a minority language ? 
  do n't know if it makes sense ( but it probably does n't ) . 
  however , the region 's [ official bulletin ] ( https://www.istra-istria.hr/fileadmin/dokumenti/italiano/bollettino/2010/nro12-del-29-10-2010.pdf ) is published in both languages and we did in fact manage to get italian-language documents from the city hall - whose minutes are also in italian - so it has to have legal status there . 
  it 's all very confusing . 
  some coastal cities , like pola , have bilingual signage and city acts are redacted in both languages . 
  but there are smaller towns further inland where italian is co-official or at least recognised ... grisignana , anyone ? 
  this is also true for parts of the slovenian littoral such as pirano or capodistria ( whose university has courses in italian , which is also used in primary/secondary education - i may be wrong on this one so do n't quote me on it ) . 
  & nbsp ; edit : in case you were wondering , both parties recognise minority languages as mandated by the treaty of osimo . 
  yeah , what about online banking just to name one ? 
  this has to be the most retarded proposal ever . 
  at this point why not use the irish for encryption purposes ? 
  freud claimed that they 're impenetrable to psychoanalysis , and nobody really understands their language anyway . 
  fyi the poles had already cracked enigma in 1932 . 
  [ the bc-52 is where it 's at . 
  ] ( http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/bc-52.htm ), 
  foss is the only answer . 
  stallman was right all along . 
  jesus harold christ on a pogo stick !, 
  someone please stop this fascist , orwellian shit . 
  this wo n't solve anything apart from making encryption effectively useless and exposing billions to attack . 
  obviously all those three-letter agencies wo n't be the only entities exploiting these backdoors , either . 
  btw what about cas ? 
  are they going to get even more broken and unreliable than they already are ? 
  time to start using pgp ... 
  just make sure nicholas cage does n't steal this one too . 
  ... and italian !, 
  [ thermojets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caproni_campini_n.1 ) may have been useless but they 're still cool . 
  dutchies wanted cheap , they got cheap . 
  besides , breda has always been a joke ; at least since the 1930s !, 
  true that - but while an empire can indeed be multicultural that does n't necessarily mean that the minorities who live there are treated well , or even fairly ( see the case of italians , czechs , jews or pretty much everybody else who was n't a native german speaker in austria-hungary ) . 
  the russian one too was made up by a veritable variety of people and cultures but poles and jews did n't have a single reason to like the czars one bit . 
  it 's even more glaring when you think about all the czechs and slovaks who chose to fight for the entente rather than their own emperor !, 
  quite a few of them were on our side during ww1 , they sent their own division ... 
  * posto fisso * is a state of mind . 
  no shit !, 
  last time i bothered with one such public competitions ( it was for a place in the army ... basically you get to become a nco and also get a degree at the local diploma mill ) there were some 6000 people for 167 openings . 
  not making this up , it was ridiculous .
