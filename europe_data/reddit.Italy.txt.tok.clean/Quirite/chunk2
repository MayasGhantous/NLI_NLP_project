  * ** libya ** is imho the least favourite of the lot because of what happened in 1970 and during the gaddafi era ( y' know , back when its government showed a slight tendency to actively promote international terrorism ) . 
  but , hey , there 's oil and lots of immigrants ready to land on our shores down there ... this is why our politicians decided that dealing with gaddafi was a-ok , at least until shit began hitting the fan in 2011 . 
  * edit * : the damn android spellcheker wo n't let me write something that makes actual sense . 
  again . 
  most italians , including our myopic government , probably do n't even know we had colonies . 
  enough said . 
  we just wanted to forget and be done with it . 
  the comments below the article are even worse than the piece itself . 
   [ ... ] is that just a small but vocal minority whining about it , or do most italians feel that way ? 
  luckily , the naysayers belong to a small , vocal and ... rather * annoying * minority . 
  yes , i do see them . 
  but most happen to be tourists or otherwise foreigners ... do n't know about weed , had some friends who smoked a few joints and that was pretty much it . 
  is it that weird ? 
  in my experience it is certainly frowned upon - we did it once and got all sorts of dirty looks and comments from passersby . 
  i would n't do that again !, 
  afaik few people are willing to get shit-faced with colleagues ... not to mention the fact that generally you do n't see many drunk folks on the streets . 
  at least not here ( i am from rome btw ) . 
  no drinking songs over here . . in fact , there 's ( almost ) no drinking at all going on with the notable exception of the country 's north-east . 
  and getting drunk is considered rather shameful in italy !, 
  ... which is not to be confused with * ti voglio bene * . 
  the latter sentence translates as `` i love you '' ( as in : `` i love you , daddy ! '' ), 
  but is only used with family and friends ; * ti amo * , on the other hand , is only ever said to a lover . 
  yeah , but i still think that such an expense is out of reach for most , with or without state subsidies . 
  and i honestly ca n't think of any decent alternative ... 
  i 'm afraid that happened almost 1000 years ago - muslim rule only lasted some 150 years in sicily ( even less in the southernmost tips of the peninsula , which was all they ever got hold of after having tried to conquer the mainland ) and the invaders themselves were totally outnumbered by the locals , before being expelled by the normans . 
  i believe that such a thing has absolutely no impact whatsoever on the italian `` volunteers '' ( but i suspect the term `` traitors '' would be more fitting ) , who are by and large northerners coming from relatively well-off families . 
  by your logic , a good chunk of spain should be a perilous nest of jihadists ready to take over the west ... 
  as pointed out above , l'aquila is mainly an historical city - meaning that a lot of its buildings were built long before modern seismic regulations ; moreover , retrofitting them is too expensive for most families i reckon . 
  some more contemporary edifices , however ( such as the one hosting the casa dello studente ) , were likely made with low-quality material ... but during the postwar building craze little to no attention was paid to such concerns and decent regulations were only passed in a second time - people wanted houses , and builders were eager to satisfy the enormous demand by spending as little as they could . 
  the mafia is n't * necessarily * involved with all this . 
  the results of such unscrupulous work are under the eyes of everybody . 
  the costs of retrofitting this kind of buildings can be prohibitive , too , and i think few families can afford the expense . 
  i know i am four months late ( sorry !, 
  ) , but i just wanted to point out the fact that central italy * definitely * is n't a fucked-up mess ; it 's far , far more like the country 's north ... not quite like it , granted , but close . 
  my country 's national holiday is ** june 2 ** - republic day , that is . 
  we keep celebrating a change in government ( the day in which the monarchy was abolished by a ~ ~ clearly rigged ~ ~ somewhat controversial referendum in 1946 ) when imho we should be celebrating ** march 17 ** instead . 
  and no , i 'm not referring to st. patrick 's but rather , to the proclamation of the kingdom of italy in 1861 . 
  there 's a military parade taking place at via dei fori imperiali , schools are closed and i suspect that 's pretty much it ... 
  i 've taken a look at the article you linked and i do agree with the author ( and with you , of course ) . 
  i must point out , however , that there 's no such thing as `` la dolce vita lifestyle '' as claimed by the woman in the video - there 's no such thing and there 's never been one !, 
  workers here do n't take midday naps or have 3-hours-long lunch breaks . 
  * la dolce vita * is just the title of a film - which is n't even among fellini 's best imho - and nothing more . 
  ** edit ** : the damn android spell-checker wo n't let me write something that makes actual sense . 
  i think the prize would go to ** palmiro togliatti ** , head of the italian communist party during and shortly after ww2 ; a close friend of stalin 's , he purposefully ignored the pleas for the safe return of thousands of pows from the eastern front , hated his own countrymen with a passion and would have gladly turned over large swaths of italy 's north-east to yugoslavia - not to mention the simple fact that he wanted italy to become a satellite of the ussr . 
  a grade-a prick , if you will . 
  bear with me , we 've got another winner : marshall ** pietro badoglio ** . 
  a mediocre commander during ww1 who suddenly found himself appointed viceroy of ethiopia just because he happened to be best buddies with someone powerful at court , and then became the guy in charge of what was left of the country after 1943 . 
  perhaps the king had in mind a close italian equivalent to petain but he was mistaken - badoglio turned out to be ( unsurprisingly ) an incompetent , boisterous babbling baboon . 
  his glorious legacy ? 
  leaving the royal italian army without instructions , to fend off for themselves while the nazis invaded the country 's north and turned against them ... thus becoming a ( now obsolete ) byword for `` traitor '' . 
  then there 's ** silvio berlusconi ** . 
  even his supporters are ashamed of him . 
  i 'm afraid , however , that uncle ben is more divisive than hated so he would n't quite qualify ... 
  * football ; * football ; * football . 
  honourable mentions : cycling and rugby , but only when the media acknowledge their existence or italy wins something . 
  the part about 44 % of the youth not attending school is pure fiction , though - that statistic actually refers to the rate of unemployment among young people . 
  he 's a bit too much , even for us . 
  i 'm pretty sure we 'd hang him the very moment we learn he 's gon na be king ... 
  that 's an urban legend , i 'm afraid - not only there 's no such law , but there are actually buildings ( located in the eur district , if memory serves me well ) which are a bit taller than st. peter 's dome . 
   italy , rome that 's actually a view of vatican city which , incredibly , is not rome ( or even italy , for that matter ) . 
  if a good skyline of the city is what you 're looking for then check [ the view ] ( http://www.coolturehunter.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/vista-dal-gianicolo.jpg ) [ from the janiculum . 
  the pretender to the throne of italy is not vittorio emanuele , but his cousin , amedeo di savoia-aosta ; not only was v.e. 
  disinherited by his father ( umberto ii , the last king of italy ) but the * unione monarchica * officially recognises his cousin as the pretender . 
  oh , and apart from being an arsehole , he 's also a murderer and a tax-evader . 
  i dare say we 've got a bit more than just `` two submarines '' ... 
  most favourite : malta . 
  least favourite : all the countries that share a land border with us . 
  sorry , guys !, 
  typical inner city rome house . 
    italy 2 : that 's just uninspired . 
  looks like a normal house . 
  actually , both seats of the italian parliament were originally built as patrician mansions in the 16th/17th centuries and were requisitioned by the government in 1871 . 
  also , i 've got to say that our chamber of deputies ( palazzo di montecitorio ) looks great - [ even the building 's rear fa\u00e7ade . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/106palazzomontecitorio.jpg ) but yeah , the senate building can be best described as `` disappointing '' . 
  they actually use the same kind of train ... [ and an italian one , at that . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ansaldobreda_driverless_metro ), 
   only brits and germans looking for fun/a quiet retirement/sex/tapas . 
  i thought i had read `` fun , quiet retirement and * sex tapes * '' . 
  now that should make for an interesting vacation ... 
  for once i can be proud of something my government has done !, 
  seriously , i did n't think i 'd have lived long enough to see this day ... 
  besides , our department of national heritage and cultural activities ( that 'd be the * sovrintendenza * ) would n't allow something like that anywhere near my city 's ( rome ) historical centre . 
  `` no no no , that 's a total eyesore !, 
  '' , that 's what they say - and this is * also * why we are stuck with a ridiculous public transit network . 
  actually , the * sovrintendenza * would n't approve of pretty much anything be it tram , trolleybus or metro . 
  if our mayor was to act on every single complain of theirs then we 'd all be commuting via flying carpet ... 
  i 'll tell you what , i do n't even think it 's about god anymore . 
  i suspect most people get their children baptised just because it 's customary to do so and , well , because it is something a lot of people in their families are more or less looking for - especially if they 're older . 
  my grandma threw a fit when she learned that my half-brother was n't going to get baptised anytime soon ( i was , but at my mother 's insistence ) . 
  of course , this is just my personal opinion and should thus be taken with the proverbial grain of salt ... 
  a very large religious community ? 
  in italy ? 
  a good 90 % of us may be ( nominally ) catholic but very few here , apart from our rather servile media and political establishment , actually give a hoot about the church . 
  if anything , your average italian is rather pissed at the vatican because of its nosy attitude towards our internal affairs , because of the ridiculous privileges it to bestows upon its employees ( vat-free petrol , supermarkets , medications and * electronics * for pete 's sake ! ), 
  and because of it owning lots of properties throughout italy without ever having to pay a penny for them . 
  oh , and also because it used to cover up paedophiles and terrorists alike ... 
  my two pence : i think the low rate of internet users can have something to do with the fact that many people in their 40s and 50s - which are still the predominant demographic in our workforce - simply `` do n't trust the internet '' , whatever that means . 
  it is not uncommon for them to shy away from services such as e-banking , e-commerce and the like ... also , i would be inclined to believe that a good chunk of them has never learnt to fully use a computer , simply because they never had to . 
  i 've worked with a lot of these people at the office and i swear that most of them required continuous assistance to do everything that was n't simply punching data into a spreadsheet or surfing the internet for shit and giggles . 
  my theory is that many of that generation have never been truly exposed to the internet and therefore do n't / ca n't see its advantages ( note that is is n't necessarily true of everybody who 's above 45 , though ) .
