  i actually passed every damn test with flying colours but did n't even make it among the top 900 . 
  btw the first pic in the article happens to be from the very class in the very base i did the tests in , it 's the national selection centre in foligno . 
  the base itself is nice enough but the ghost-town in question is one depressing hellhole with fog and mosquitoes ; when i went all shops were closed , there was only one pizzeria with a single customer ( me ) and a single slice of pizza awaiting for me . 
  then i just went back to the hotel to sleep . 
  at four in the afternoon . 
  i 'm terribly sorry . 
  humour just does n't translate very well on the interwebs . 
  a-h started the war , which italy had * no obligation whatsoever * to join under treaty terms - the triple alliance being a purely defensive pact . 
  and we would n't have done it anyway , not least because we knew the austrians were n't going to uphold their end of the bargain anyhoo ... 
  nothing personnel but , hey , that 's how interlocking alliances work . 
  bros ? 
  actual bros do n't try to pre-emptively strike you ( 1908 ) , or refuse to abide to the treaties they themselves have signed and ratified ( 1908 again ) because they somehow do n't apply to them , or discriminate against your own countrymen . 
  there is a reason if the czechs - despite being austrian subjects - chose to fight them instead ... 
  yeah , but they also created italy in the first place ... which kind of is the point of this very holiday ? 
  btw the king did not drag us into world war one ; like the queen and his father before him , victor emmanuel was pro-german . 
  blame our prime minister ( salandra ) and intellectuals ( d'annunzio ) who pushed for a bloodbath instead . 
  no takesies backsies on this blessed day !, 
  still a holiday , but for some reason it 's a minor one . 
  perhaps because of its association with the monarchy ? 
  that 's a silly taboo we got over here ... they went to great lengths to hide , or remove , the coat of arms from historical flags during the parade in 2011 . 
  and do n't expect to see it on flags on the 4th of november , either . 
  our politicians like to sweep everything under the carpet , better pretend italy did n't exist before 1946 i guess ? 
  no , no - thank * you * for your service !, 
  yes . 
  we do . 
  & nbsp ;  [ ... ] could not get enough of the big warships & nbsp ; ? 
  not surprising , condos have been around for 2000 years ( hell , we 've literally invented them ) . 
  the traffic , awful public transportation , lack of parking spots , badly-planned neighbourhoods , drab architecture , fucking useless ancient shit , dirtiness , duplicate embassies that make entire blocks and sidewalks off-limits when they do n't take up even more parking space , the deadly roads , asshole cops , housing situation ( flats are old and decrepit but still cost you a fortune so it 's either inheritance or nothing ) , the overall lack of opportunities . 
  and we definitely have a problem with gypsies . 
  the city centre is hardly representative of rome itself , it 's the kind of theme park locals have little access to and the 2.8 million of us live elsewhere anyway ( it is also a nuisance because you ca n't drive through it ) . 
  it very much does n't . 
  by that metric alone rome would be the bestest place on earth but it 's still an unliveable , depressing , congested , jobless and overall decrepit shithole of a capital city . 
  the province of venice does n't even exist anymore . 
  & nbsp ;  hey , but at least we got no anti-gay laws ... 
  i mean - what else should we do anyway ? 
  & nbsp ; they inherited our penal code of the time - the one of 1890 which had homosexuality decriminalised . 
  had vatican city been released two years later , in 1931 , it would 've gotten the fascist one ( and its discriminatory provisions ) . 
  yes , but not that much . 
  and you 'd better not confuse the two , people may not appreciate it ... 
  yep . 
  you forgot the gratuitous anglicisms and spelling mistakes , reading * repubblica * ( our version of the grauniad but with a little bit of daily heil thrown in ) has long become an embarrassing exercise ... btw that category also includes politicians . 
  and possibly all the doctors who like to write their prescriptions in goa'uld hyerogliphs . 
  yes and no . 
  the * patois * , while obviously far closer to french than it is to italian , is not a dialect of either language but rather , its very own thing - just like occitan . 
  and the answer to your other question would be `` not much '' afaik . 
  and libyans ( part of my family is from there ) . 
  libyan arabic also has plenty of italian loanwords . 
  btw somalia was administered by italy until 1960 , and italian was the language of learning in somalian universities until 1991 ; as far as eritrea is concerned , it was small enough and we held on it long enough ( 1890 - 1952 ) for it to be heavily colonised/invested upon . 
  for some reason they like us down there so ... that 's not surprising at all . 
  journalists . 
  fyi they do n't actually speak ` proper ' french up there , the val d'aosta has its very own * patois * ( as well as smallish occitan-speaking pockets ) . 
  but the whole point is kind of moot anyway as everyone just speaks italian nowadays ... edit : sorry , it 's arpitan . 
  thanks for pointing that out . 
  as long as you do n't do that in public and near children !, 
  that 's the president 's direct line to moscow ... you know , in case shit hits the fan . 
  heresy !, 
  at home we all have our very own bum-towels , thankyouverymuch . 
  yeah , i do n't think you 're supposed to wash your bum with pipin ' hot water ... 
  it was a euiii reference . 
  of course not . 
  besides , the local resistance in val d'aosta not only actively resisted de gaulle 's propaganda efforts but also chose to side with * the fascists * against the french in 1944 because they did n't want to be annexed by them ... they 've been part of savoy , then sardinia , then piedmont-sardinia , * and then * italy for a good millennium now . 
  so , no * rattachement * for you !, 
  then i must have wrongly interpreted your previous statements , because they seemed to suggest just that . 
  & nbsp ;  [ ... ] they did n't and do n't want to be part of italy , the cultural and the nation-state & nbsp ; i could understand the part about nation-states , but the one about them somehow `` refusing '' to be culturally related to the peninsula is utter bull i 'm afraid ( how exactly would a tuscan accomplish that ? 
  and in the 18th century , no less ? 
  it 'd make just as sense as me refusing to consider italian a romance language ) . 
  besides , they were fighting the genoese because * of taxes * which , truth to be told , they [ the genoese ] were quite fond of . 
  and in case you had n't noticed ... it 's not quite like they want to be part of france , either . 
  they did n't spend the better part of the last century planting bombs and killing people out of sheer affection for the french state . 
  of course - but my point was about a common * cultural * identity , which does n't necessarily coincide with a nation-state . 
  & nbsp ;  [ ... ] never expressed any desire to be part of this country . 
  & nbsp ; [ pasquale paoli ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pasquale_paoli ) would like to disagree . 
  wrong anthem , mate ( that 's the one co-opted by the northern league !, 
  really ? 
  i was under the impression that something had actually happened . 
  1 ) our [ queen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elena_of_montenegro ) was from there !, 
  2 ) do n't they also have a small italian-speaking community ? 
  3 ) there was a russian-backed coup earlier this year ... 4 ) ... aaand the country 's an eternal nato candidate . 
  5 ) does [ milena vukotic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milena_vukotic ) count ? 
  spies ? 
  looking for secrets ?!, 
  i thought they only served to fabricate claims or sow discontent ... 
  does n't italian too have some vestigial cases , at least for pronouns ? 
  things like * egli , lui , gli * ( he , him , to him ) or * ella , lei , le * ( she , her , to her ) . 
  but can one change covers like in the old model ? 
  i still have the weed-themed one i found in middle school ... 
  good thing op specified the country , or else people might 've gotten confused . 
  traitor * and * art looter , no less . 
  no worries , if you want cheap just come to abruzzo ( and do n't forget to bring the monies ) . 
  same-ish mountains for half the price !, 
  what 's not to like ? 
  & nbsp ; ^ ^ ^ seriously , ^ ^ ^ check ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ out . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ pretty ^ ^ ^ ^ please ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ we 'll ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ pay ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you !, 
  yeah , get 'em nords out of cyrodiil !, 
  it 's victor emmanuel ( and cavour was the one who actually signed the deal ) . 
  but anyway , i guess that ruling over the whole peninsula was well worth it ... ? 
  and i 'd like to be able to park near home for once !, 
  i do n't want even more diplomatic missions taking up all the spots ... 
  to be fair - we already have fao , ifad , the nato defence college , a shit-tonne of diplomatic missions ... most of the countries that have an embassy here also have another one dealing with the holy see ; it 's double the inconvenience .
