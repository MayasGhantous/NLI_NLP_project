  that 's the point . 
  nothing . 
  it just stops there . 
  no shit !, 
  but the difference is that we get nothing in return . 
  at least you 're not addicted to crusader kings 2 . 
  yes , but let 's also not forget that poland was invaded by those very same soviets in 1939 . 
  you 'll be be surprised to hear that often , foreign destinations are actually less expensive than italy itself . 
  unless of course you go to southern italy but the other two thirds of the country ... eh ... 
  besides , mieulet 's map is an actual forgery whose author moved the border in such a way that the summit of the monte bianco appears to be entirely on the french side , and which the french government still claims of being valid . 
  whoops . 
  the typo stays ... 
  it never will be unless we recognise that nuclear energy + renewables is the only way . 
  but try to talk about nuclear and vaccines to my cuntrymen ... 
  nothin ' but a lotta talk and a badge !, 
  of course , the soldiers are only a part of the whole picture but then again i would also guess that if you , or i , were to call those rebels `` ukrainians '' to their faces we 'd be in for a beating or at the very least quite a nasty quarter-hour . 
  this not too unreasonable of a guess , especially if you consider that we 're talking about a certain ( and really sleazy ) guy called putin who by chance happens to be the autocratic ruler of russia and who 's not above murdering his own people , or invading other countries ~ ~ for shits and giggles ~ ~ in order to reassert dominance and protect his nation from the evil west . 
  but who am i to judge ? 
  i 'm sure he 's a man of peace , his moral stature is on par with kadyrov 's . 
  you must be right !, 
  there are no russian troops in ukraine , just like there were no germans in gleiwitz . 
  russian tourists too can be dangerous ; sometimes they even shoot down civilian planes . 
  i 'm glad we do n't allow things like nail clippers , hairspray or buk missiles inside carry-ons any longer ... 
  `` pro-russian separatists '' we all know those are actual russian soldiers without insignias ... 
  see [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/basilica_di_san_pietro_1450.jpg ) and [ here ] ( https://www.picclickimg.com/d/w1600/pict/282466518972_/antique-magic-lantern-glass-slide-photo-bridges-and.jpg ) ( minus the outer walls , moat and papal apartments - which did n't exist yet during ezio 's lifetime ) . 
  no , i meant the fact that places like st. peter 's and castel sant ` angelo were modelled after their modern-day counterparts and look nothing like the buildings ezio would 've actually interacted with . 
  but then again i 'm the kind of person who mods the shit out of crusader kings 2 and other paradox games for better historical accuracy ... 
  rome not so much - * brotherhood * was one of the best ac games but it was pretty meh on that side . 
  recon purposes ? 
  you know , a submarine is like a ship but it can dive underwater . 
  i 'm sure the beatles did a song about it . 
  * again . 
  * they were mandatory until 1998 , then rosy bindi said fuck it just because . 
  hey !, 
  i actually climbed that one in * assassin 's creed : unity * ( shit game anyways ) . 
  this is going to be a pretty big mission ( by modern european standards ) given its scope ; other [ italian-language sources ] ( http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/politica/2017/07/28/cdm-vara-missione-italiana-in-libia-navi-aerei-700-militari-_82cfdb5f-f546-4cd0-91f1-315fcee5b703.html ) speak of at least five navy vessels , a submarine , lotsa drones and a 700-men-strong ground force . 
  not quite - but i would argue that he 's trying to create his own bloc in the region . 
  now , the flow of azerbaijani oil may become a cause of concern in and on itself ... 
  in the meantime , italy [ has just green-lighted ] ( http://www.ilsecoloxix.it/p/italia/2017/07/28/asbvqlai-parlamento_missione_italiana.shtml ) its naval mission to libya in accordance with al-serraj 's official request ; five vessels , a submarine , an untold number of drones and 700 men will be assisting the libyan coast guard ... of course the libyan government denies ever having sent such a request despite official indications to the contrary ( a protocol was signed , after all ) but this has more to do with al-sarraj 's wanting to save face in front of his own people . 
  it is , at least nominally , but it seems like the sultan is doing everything in his power to undermine it . 
  and i 'm not just referring to turkey 's squabbles with other nato members , but also to the more recent deals with russia ... or erdogan 's behaviour toward nato troops during and after the fake-ass `` coup '' of 2016 ... 
  if * modern warfare * taught me anything then makarov has to be behind all this . 
  so macron is basically the french renzi ? 
  the parallels are truly striking . 
  azerbaigian and turkey have a very chummy relationship , i would n't be surprised if erdogan had a hand in it .

  more like reichsburger king , amirite ? 
  it 's interesting that the author of this piece of shit article appears to be italian herself , even though she may very well be one of those annoying fake italians from new jersey or something . 
  i mean - no actual italian would ever agree with such a crappy football analogy , it 's almost as if she knows jack-shit about the country she supposedly is from . 
  i just wanted to let you know that i appreciate the boobies , op . 
  you da real mvp !, 
  i was thinking specifically about the colonial competition with france . 
  all we have to do is ~ ~ follow the damn train ~ ~ go to mecca , do the hajj et voila !, 
  no longer decadent . 
  no , but rome definitely is n't clean by ~ ~ northern ~ ~ any standards . 
  the city centre should be ok though . 
  about damn time ? 
  more like [ 1881 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_conquest_of_tunisia#colonial_competition ) . 
  that money goes to charity , and i see plenty of tourists throwing coins in empty fountains anyway . 
  not many . 
  most of the historical fountains are still fed by the ancient aqueducts which carry non-drinkable water and whose springs are located in entirely different parts of lazio ( the kind of water households and drinking fountain get comes from a different system altogether ) . 
  as far as the vatican is concerned , the water flowing from the fountains in st. peter 's square is the very same one i 'm drinking right now ... one of the few perks of being a roman i guess ... 
  drought my fat roman arse !, 
  more like : `` our aqueducts are decrepit and leak slightly less than half of the water they 're supposed to carry because acea is too busy paying fat dividents to its shareholders to even care for basic maintenance ; our mayor is an idiot and sure likes headbutting with whoever happens to be in charge of the region , which should n't exist anyway '' . 
  and the current heat-wave is n't making things any easier , mind you . 
  * notorious tax haven * their football team is still better than that of san marino * basically san marino with catalan speakers and even more mountains but no katanas * ? 
  they 're concentrated in bolzano and merano , mostly . 
  i found [ this article ] ( https://lavalleedelaroyaterredefrontieres.wordpress.com/2016/03/19/1947-le-rattachement-de-tende-et-la-brigue-5/ ) ( it 's in french ) albeit it 's about briga and tenda . 
  by means of rigged plebiscites , crimea-style . 
  they attempted the same shit in ventimiglia . 
  hell no !, 
  if i could choose , i 'd rather get istria back than keep hanging on to south tyrol . 
  who gives a fuck about the olympics and that guy who screams his love for bottled water from mountaintops ... 
  funny thing is , the local resistance [ chose to ally with the fascist militia ] ( http://torino.repubblica.it/cronaca/2015/04/25/news/quando_fascisti_e_partigiani_si_allearono_per_difendere_la_val_d_aosta_storia_inedita_della_resistenza-112821647/ ) rather than accept french rule ( which would 've meant no autonomy ) - the americans had to intervene and ~ ~ repel ~ ~ escort the french forces to the border . 
  & nbsp ;  how does your employer not pay you on time ? 
  & nbsp ; they just do . 
  we also have `` voluntary '' ( read : mandatory ) unpaid overtime ... & nbsp ;  what do they say when you ask them why your paycheck has not come yet ? 
  & nbsp ; * `` sorry , your paycheque is late this month because of [ bs excuse ] . 
  got ta wait until the 10th '' . 
  * & nbsp ;  what are you supposed to do in the meantime for money ? 
  & nbsp ; keep pestering them about it ? 
  threaten legal action ? 
  resort to a union lawyer ? 
  & nbsp ;  how much is rent/transport/etc in locations where $ 800 salaries are ? 
  & nbsp ; rent alone is at least 600/700 $ in rome ( even in the crappiest of districts with a gypsy camp next door ) unless of course you happen to find someone to share an apartment with but even then , at least half of your paycheque goes to the landlord . 
  public transportation is around 150/250 $ a year ; cars and petrol are much more expensive than that . 
  now you see why people here tend to stick with their parents ? 
  i did n't factor bills , tuition , taxes or even other expenses - like eating out . 
  have fun with those . 
  ( always assuming they actually pay you and in a timely manner , at that ) . 
  after - but then again , most new workers do n't get to have any kind of social security contributions paid because of the new and improved `` apprenticeship '' system ( which is basically the 21st-century equivalent to indentured servitude , thanks renzi and whoever came before him ) so talking about taxes is a moot point anyway . 
  and nowadays , 800 euro is considered a pretty good salary by most young people . 
  i used to get paid 300 quid a month `` just '' to clean toilets at the stadium !, 
  it already is . 
  no shit * more news at 11 *, 
  it 's just grey and foggy and terribly pretentious . 
  genoa is a close second - the only city where just about everything closes at 8 sharp . 
  trieste is a city-sized retirement home . 
  rome is an unliveable shithole with a nice centre and naples , well , * it 's naples * .
