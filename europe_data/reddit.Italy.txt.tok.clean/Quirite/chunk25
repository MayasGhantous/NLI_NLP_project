  foligno is what silent hill or raccoon city would look like irl ( surprised they did n't twin it with pripyat ? ) . 
  latina and pomezia should be nuked into oblivion , never to be rebuilt or spoken of ever again ... 
  * stability -1 *, 
  there 's no escape !, 
  op 's probably doing the nasty in the pasty . 
  this is retarded on so many levels, 
  lizzie the lizard would be better suited to rule over mankind imho . 
  * that krum guy from the harry potter franchise ? 
  * most ( all ? ), 
  asylum productions are shot there * they invented and use the cyrillic alphabet * their king of old became prime minister * cloned credit cards and atm skimmers * formerly part of the commie bloc * formerly part of the axis , too * the byzantines hate them !, 
  * this other guy [ todorov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tzvetan_todorov ) * birthplace of yogurt * [ ken lee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqt-h753jhi ) * ? 
  seriously , the guys at paradox need to nerf the seduction focus . 
  that 's not exactly a `` debate '' - afaik most italians ( and the other parties ) are against this , the pd is quite alone in its push to expand citizenship rights . 
  personally , i find it some form political suicide given the current climate but whatever ... the italian left - or whatever 's * left * of it - always had a knack for self-destruction anyway ... are they planning on losing every election from here to eternity ? 
  because that 's how you hand the country to the populists . 
  hell , they 've even succeeded in the difficult task of making forza italia ( and berlusconi ) relevant again ffs !, 
  truth to be told i 'm not too happy about giving ms raggi my own tax money , either . 
  really ? 
  the recurring ban on alcohol is as much of a summer-y tradition as tourists being fined for bathing into historical fountains and drunk american students getting run over by trains or falling down the tiber 's embankments . 
  nothing to see here folks !, 
  even then , latium is among the regions which gives more money than it takes . 
  un-belly-evable but true . 
  anything south of emilia-romagna is central italy and south of the liri ... the south proper begins . 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  did i hurt someone 's precious padanian feelings ? 
  you 're aware of the fact that we too are plagued by them just as much as you are and have to pay the highest irpef/local taxes in the country , are you ? 
  it 's not like we sit here all day long syphoning money from the rest of the country ... ... albeit sometimes i wish we did that just to spite you guys !, 
  thankfully , whoever took this pic was n't looking at the casino . 
  it could be argued that modern-day ostia is a toilet , too . 
  do explain ... 
  to be fair , neither did regions and the so-called `` devolution '' only made things worse . 
  not much , given the sheer amount of british tourists i saw there . 
  you ai n't even cheap anymore !, 
  username checks out !, 
  er ... sorry ... wrong monument . 
  more like a covfefest amirite ? 
  i would n't know * but * afaik the temple had its fair share of renovations in the 19th century and knowing how people like viollet-le-duc conducted their restorations , whatever it must 've been through had to be a pretty thorough job . 
  to be fair , i do n't think this is the only preserved temple of the ancient world ? 
  the [ temple of portunus ] ( http://i.static.ilvelino.it/blobs/variants/3/9/b/a/39baf36c-2733-4b22-a600-f6e88d6343d5_large.jpg?_635405859430286087 ) is another ... so is [ the one to hercules victor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/temple_of_hercules_victor ) and the pantheon ... 
  i do n't think that laptop would last a few years , it 's probably going to fry itself in a matter of months ... if you want something that lasts decades then you would definitely want to get yourself a thinkpad , no questions asked . 
  as the duchy of athens , they 're such a pain in the arse !, 
  i still have my nokia 3200 from the days of middle school . 
  it 's a fucking tank . 
  good . 
  good . 
  i wonder if anyone has tried to repair , or even open , [ a surface laptop ? 
  ] ( https://www.ifixit.com/teardown/microsoft+surface+laptop+teardown/92915 ), 
  can confirm - i 'm italian and quite proficient at operating drilling equipment , * if you know what i mean . 
  you wanted cheap , you got cheap . 
  that 's the magic of the lowest bidder !, 
  i agree that individual austrians probably did n't want a war but their government surely did , or else it would n't have sent that ultimatum !, 
  there 's no way it could 've stayed a local conflict - the russians were n't going to allow them to steamroll through serbia at their leasure . 
  and a-h was backed by germany , which was n't exactly a small power ... 
  yes - you 're most definitely right but then again , italy was n't the one who actually sent an ultimatum to serbia knowing fully and well that they could have never accepted it ... austria wanted war and ended up paying for it . 
  such is life . 
  & nbsp ;  anyway italy has already commited an unprovoced attack on its former ally austria in 1915 ... & nbsp ; oh but it 's definitely not like austria was n't planning to do the very same thing to italy in 1908 , while at the same time happily engaging in widespread discrimination of italians within the empire . 
  wonderful , wonderful allies indeed !, 
  ( especially if we include that other paragon of virtue , the german reich ... with genocides and all ... ) by the way let 's talk about that time after the annexation of bosnia , the one in which austria-hungary was legally bound by treaty clauses to cede some lands as compensation but decided that legal provisions did n't apply to them ? 
  why the dodecanese though ? 
  we only got that in 1912 after beating the ottomans . 
  as for savoy , it was so irrelevant not even the kings wanted it and they were more than happy to trade it away ... 
  [ i summon d'annvnzio !,

  it 's still kind of alive in the val d'aosta , though . 
  kind of . 
  day of the jackal 2 : electric boogaloo, 
  for that to happen islam 's moral authority must be over 90 % , then you 'd need 500 piety and control all holy sites . 
  not sure about culture tech ... 
  tolerance iii may help ... 
  what 's even more amazing is the fact that it has been completely rebuilt , along with a good chunk of the city centre . 
  i for one would like to see the dresden model being applied to other cities like bucharest or warsaw ... 
  we should n't be too hard on windows 10 ; it was the very reason i switched to debian !, 
  well , no wonder they call it e-stonia . 
  could that be the colonel 's niece ? 
  * cyprus is an island indeed ... * ... half of which has been occupied/colonised by turkey for some time now * in eu2 ( and 3 ) they 're always allied with both venice and the knights * there 's a gothic cathedral which has been turned into a mosque * marcantonio bragadin was flayed alive in famagosta * britain has a couple of military bases there * venus/aphrodites was born near paphos * anna vissi too is from cyprus * they use the $ uro * ? 
  ah , but it 's richard lynn !, 
  i 'm surprised he did n't quote goebbels ( or at the very least lombroso ) . 
  but if you work in a sector not regulated by one of these contracts - nowadays this is a very common occurrence - you 're screwed , and completely at the mercy of your employer . 
  i used to clean toilets for way less than $ 4/hour ... 
  you have a few bits of molise ... 
  i mean , it 's not much but it 's on the other side of the adriatic ... 
  so , mount `` five fingers '' ? 
  and they say that studying ancient greek in high school is useless !, 
  amateurs . 
  we actually had l. 500.000 banknotes and paycheques used to be in the millions . 
  we even had actual billion - and trillionaires !, 
  have an upvote , for once i do n't have to look at that soviet excuse of an emblem !, 
  well , even from a purely infrastructural/economical point of view these regions are fairly similar to each other ( plus you 've got aerospace and big pharma in latium , steel plants in umbria , plenty of light industry in the marches and abruzzo ) . 
  as far as abruzzo itself is concerned , that 's a bit of an odd case ... culturally and economically-wise it 's part of the centre but istat considers it part of the south simply because it used to belong to the kingdom of naples . 
  speaking of infrastructure , the region is on par with the rest of the country and as far as commerce goes you ca n't really take it apart from latium ( civitavecchia , not ancona , is the main port of choice for the local companies ) . 
  it may be slightly poorer than the rest of them , but it 's miles ahead of the south . 
  no comparison . 
  and they 've got the infn ... 
  tbf nothing about these regions strike me as particularly northern but you might have a point about tuscany ; i still have my doubts about the other two , though . 
  do n't forget about latium and - depending from your pov - abruzzo . 
  not least because umbria and ( northern ) latium are basically interchangeable . 
  thank you for having forgotten central italy , mate !, 
  by the waaay , i 'd rather welcome matteo renzi as my personal lord and saviour and serve him babies for breakfast than be forcibly lumped with either bloc . 
  * i buy my medicines there * but i also want to work there * filthy rich and sort of a tax haven * you can listen to radio maria from your buzzer * the pope 's too nosy , really * it 's mussolini 's fault * shady af * ? 
  the power of logic compels me !,
