  what a time to have been alive !, 
  please , no . 
  unless you like being oppressed and financially exploited by a bunch of foreign inbreds with prominent mandibules ? 
  16 years . 
  he 's already in jail and the ruling is pretty much final . 
  it really is !, 
  perhaps the b/w photos were n't that good ? 
  here 's the [ link ] ( https://www.google.it/maps/@41.9459061,12.5340704,3a,75y,109.78h,98.18t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1snb024yq7pfsipfcfjkbgqg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) you requested . 
  btw , yes ... these are all council houses . 
  yeah , there 's plenty throughout the city . 
  sure . 
  not my own housing but [ this is ] ( https://www.google.it/maps/place/via+tonale,+00139+roma/@41.9467401,12.533937,3a,75y,23.53h,96.9t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sztwr-jm3vf7gdflgivowkq!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo1.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dztwr-jm3vf7gdflgivowkq%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d102.271126%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x132f6402fdf901fd:0x5036074d6903c511!8m2!3d41.9491594!4d12.5330109 ) [ almost ] ( http://www.archidiap.com/beta/assets/uploads/2014/09/via-tonale-2-1024x575.jpg ) [ the ] ( http://media.getrix.it/1/6107/2574373304_hd.jpg ) [ same ] ( http://www.simonamizzoni.com/wp-content/gallery/tufello/iacp-tufello-roma-2.jpg ) [ district ] ( http://www.simonamizzoni.com/wp-content/gallery/tufello/iacp-tufello-roma-10.jpg ) . 
  our block 's much older , less `` square '' and wayyy nicer though !, 
  1 ) rent is very , very cheap ( 150 $ / month plus heating ; other bills are on you ) . 
  2 ) both . 
  tenants also have the exclusive right to buy the flat they live in , ours is for sale at around 60.000 $ ( which we do n't have but that 's another story ! ) . 
  further discounts are available if you choose to pay all at once and in cash . 
  3 ) no and no . 
  waiting lists can last decades and my cousin only got in because she used to live there with her grandma and `` inherited '' the contract when she died . 
  then i moved in with our other , ` common ' grandma and aunt . 
  4 ) a state entity . 
  there are council houses run by the municipality but they 're even harder to come by . 
  5 ) ours is no commieblock - the condo we live in was built in the 1920s - but maintenance is kept to the barest of minimums . 
  we ai n't got no lift , the marble of the stairs has gotten incredibly slippery from ninety years of use , many of those apartments originally did n't even have `` proper '' bathrooms and the external plumbing means you get hot water in summer or ( figurative ) ice cubes in winter . 
  at least the individual homes have been renovated over time . 
  6 ) not at all ; ours is a fairly pleasant condo with a garden and we make for a nice community . 
  during summer there 's plenty of old people chatting on the benches , children playing football ... that kind of things . 
  a few sundays we even had one of those communal lunches in the sun . 
  pretty relaxed atmosphere . 
  we all know each other as the original tenants were civil servants , many of their families still live here ( but unlike us they 've bought their flats ) . 
  make the papal states great again !, 
  my 3200 surely never di ( e ) d. still going strong 10 + years later . 
  * new phone , who dis ? 
  * yeeeeeeaaaaah !, 
  yeah , that was the joke . 
  going for the ascension victory i see . 
  it is known . 
  that 's the joke . 
  besides , being a full-time demigod sure must be exhausting . 
  indeed . 
  if you ever happen to visit trieste , have a couple of glasses with the locals and call them * furlani * then i can guarantee with the utmost certainty that ice is n't the only thing that 's going to get broken that day . 
  truly an amazing city ... and * friulians * are such hospitable people . 
  spain ? 
  portugal ? 
  unless your arms are broken ? 
  lots of sex and weed , possibly at the same time ( but of course you have to wait when nobody 's home ) . 
  we do have closer families than n. europeans , indeed , but what you describe is not the case anymore - and has n't been for 30 years !, 
  besides , i do n't think italian-americans ( always assuming you can make generalisations on such a broad demographic ) could be considered representative of their european kin . 
  oranges and apples and all that . 
  i did n't enjoy my predicament one bit and gtfo as soon as i got the money . 
  you 're all too right , this is a vicious cycle indeed . 
  payroll taxes are too high --  employers are less inclined to hire people properly ; illegal , poorly paid jobs abound --  payroll taxes increase because someone has to make up for the lost revenue and our social security system is on the brink of collapse --  employers are even less inclined to hire people legallly --  rinse and repeat . 
  and this goes without mentioning the rampant unemployment , economic stagnation , etc. 
  surprise !, 
  turns out you need a stable job with a decent paycheque in order to be able to afford a place of your own , neither of which are easy to find at the moment - at least not in this country . 
  when all you can find is a shitty , 600 $ / month under-the-table gig and the only prospect you have is the concrete possibility of getting the boot at any moment ... well ... 
  you 've never left the historical centre , though , and the centre is where tourists are . 
  locals do n't - actually , ca n't afford to - live there anymore and businesses too have been fleeing the premises in order to make way for even more tourist-related shit . 
  the rest ( 90 % ) of the city is completely different and devoid of visitors ... 
  tbf the russian campaign was doomed anyway from the very start . 
  with or without the intervention in greece . 
  not only because of environmental factors but also because the soviet union was much more resilient than lil ' stache thought ; turns out you ca n't just kick the door `` and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down ! '' . 
  turning the various nationalities of the ussr against the russians would 've been a sensible move which could 've helped the nazi cause a lot but their war goals/racial policies obviously did not allow for that ; and truth to be told , neither did their industrial capacity ( or their tiny supply lines . 
  or awful quality control . 
  or lack of planning . 
  barbarossa would 've failed regardless unless you go back in time and give the nazis plenty of nukes . 
  and even then they would have trouble using them , * arische physik * does n't account for that !, 
  oil reserves ? 
  well , to be fair , trickle-down economics actually * do * work . 
  the proof ? 
  shit always rolls downhill !, 
  you ca n't deny that !, 
  & nbsp ;  2 ) increase workers mobility & nbsp ; but there 's no need to . 
  southerners have been moving up north for like , what ? 
  120 years now ? 
  in fact the southern half of my country is slowly turning into a demographic desert ... 
  yes , they used to be . 
  that 's kind of the whole point of this holiday . 
  you too - and pray the nsa does n't come knocking at your door !, 
  no doubt about it . 
  but at the very least we have n't been spending the better part of the past sixty years trying to make the whole world despise us by actively screwing the middle east , propping dictatorships left and right or , y' know , denying the existence of climate change . 
  enjoy your nucular deterrent , hun ... ... you 're gon na need it next time someone jokes about the hand size of glorious orange leader !, 
  u/quirite over and out . 
  & nbsp ;  you mean italy 's allies ? 
  & nbsp ; yes , of course i do . 
  see ? 
  you 're not as thick as truman said you were !, 
  & nbsp ;  we 've got nukes too . 
  you know who does n't ? 
  italy . 
  & nbsp ; truth to be told , you need those more than we do . 
  with glorious orange leader in power you never know !, 
  you 're all too right , man . 
  but who needs decent generals when you can just ditch your men in the loving care of the japanese ? 
  btw let 's hope you do n't manage to piss the chinese off ... again ... they 've got nukes this time !, 
  of course you are , sweetie . 
  of course you are . 
  thank god we have none other than general macarthur to remind us of our rightful place !, 
  by the way , i hope you found that torpedo boat comfortable . 
  how was the trip from the philippines ?
