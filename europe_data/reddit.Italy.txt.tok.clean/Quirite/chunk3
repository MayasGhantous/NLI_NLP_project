  finally - the fact that italy has got some of the most expensive phone/internet providers in the eu , coupled with a broadband network that was until recently very limited did n't help , either . 
  fun trivia : my former workplace , which is located in rome 's very city centre ( not exactly in the middle of nowhere , i dare say ) did n't get broadband coverage until late 2009 . 
  i did n't believe my coworkers when they first told me . 
  ** edit ** : my english is just terrible . 
  the [ sanremo music festival ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sanremo_music_festival ) takes the cake . 
  it is probably the most boring song contest in the whole world , during which a bunch of ` stars ' are chosen to perform the same bland , cheesy songs over and over again . 
  there are also guest stars but most of them are either long-forgotten singers or actors who were likely past their prime in the '80s . 
  sometimes , in a desperate attempt to spice things up and save the festival from total oblivion , the organisers will : * invite ( at our expense ) foreign ` celebrities ' in dire need for a cheque ; * let a scantily-clad model with an exotic name ( whose rack should help gain more viewers ) host the show ; * stage a completely fake scandal that will , hopefully , make the next day 's headlines . 
  * sanremo * is bad . 
  and it 's been around for some 63 years now ... 
  yeah , titles should n't be edited like that but neutrolgreek 's concerns do have a basis in reality . 
  some of the policemen who were working with immigrants have been recently found positive for tuberculosis . 
  i agree but , technically , he 's still under trial ... therefore , for the time being he 's free to attend as many parties as he likes before being thrown into jail . 
  i only hope someone 's going to punch that bloody coward in the nose . 
   i chose to ignore religiousness , political choices and lack of interest in the world  religiousness ? 
  our media/politicians may be rather pro-vatican , but your average joe does n't give a shit about it . 
  agree with the lack of interest in the world , though - that 's especially true for romans ( and i 'm one ) . 
  i 'm italian and i 'd like to add my two pence ( you know , i did n't find the paragraphs about italy that accurate ) . 
  the northern league is , nowadays , little more than a second-rate bunch of nutjobs . 
  scandals , corruption , and links with the calabrese ( ! ), 
  ` ndrangheta - coupled with the simple fact that most people have long realised how ridiculous the nl is - did the rest . 
  during the past elections , the party has lost a great deal of power ( its candidates having been voted out from almost any of the towns they controlled ) and even cassano magnago , formerly a nl stronghold as well as umberto bossi 's hometown , turned its back on them . 
  there are two other factors that may have contributed to the decline of the northern league : the first is that unlike catalonia or scotland , the very idea of `` padania '' has got almost no basis in reality . 
  secondly , nl politicians rarely ( if ever ) delivered what they promised , which is a constant in italian politics . 
  as for the pro-independence faction in veneto ... the so-called `` referendum '' was , in reality , an online poll . 
  and the turnout was less than 150,000 ` voters ' , some of which casted their ballot from abroad . 
  i think that says it all !, 
  uhm ... 
  i am italian and i do , in fact , like the internet !, 
  and i think that `` top italian philosopher '' thing to be an exaggeration - this is the first time i hear of that weirdo . 
   italian : `` 30 years of triangular friendship meeting '' ( not even sure what that means ) it does n't make much sense in the original italian , either . 
  grow up people , it 's just a typo . 
  may i ask you why ? 
  imho having a machine-gun pointed at me during random road checks can be a bit intimidating . 
   or is this handled by the cabinieri as well ? 
  the carabinieri have military police duties as well . 
  afaik most of us were rooting for argentina . 
  being from italy , i just want a slightly competent ( and , preferably , * lasting * ) government . 
  i 'm not asking too much , am i ? 
   dear europeans , jokes aside . 
  what comes to your mind when you hear argentina ? 
  i ca n't help but think of other italians ? 
  sorry , but just every argentinian person in my university ( there are lots of them lately ) speaks near-flawless italian . 
  and they may just as well be of italian descent themselves , many having italian surnames and/or dual citizenship ... oh , and of course messi , maradona ( i do n't care what napoli fans say , he 's a damn tax-evader !, 
  and teen soaps that were/are all the rage ( floricienta , patito feo , violetta ) with girls over here . 
  and beef . 
  believe it or not , rome and its inhabitants are looked down upon by pretty much the rest of italy . 
  according to the sterotype we 're a rude , arrogant , crass and sailor-mouthed ( did i say work-shy ? ), 
  bunch who speaks an horrible dialect . 
  add to that all the other amenities that come with being a capital city , because the very fact that rome * is * the capital ( some people just ca n't wrap their heads around it ... just ask the milanese ) seems to be a source of discontent . 
  and there are the football rivalries : from that perspective too we 're disliked by just about everybody else and - what is worse - we 're proud of it . 
  i think i should mention the ever-present north-south divide , too ; from that point of view , southerners get bashed a lot and sadly , not just by the northern league . 
  but , hey , there 's an advantage in being roman ... we could n't care less about the whole north/south thing ( surprise , we 're neither !, 
   `` we want to see a single , unified european-eurasian entity '' `` possibly under our control '' , putin later added . 
  well , compared to most italian politicians renzi really * is * a kid ... 
  agreed ( and i 'm what you 'd call a right-winger !, 
  let us hope so , even though i do n't trust renzi that much ( there are * far * worse politicians around , granted , and the kid has got some good ideas ... but i think he 's still too na\u00efve to be an effective leader ) . 
  common sense prevailed , at last . 
  i do n't - and pretty much everybody i know does n't , either . 
  mine would be umberto ii , the last king of italy ( the choice ai n't too hard : we only got four monarchs reigning for a grand total of * 85 years * , and two of them were n't exactly brilliant ) . 
  he was overall a decent human being - quite different from his father - and the few policies enacted during his reign were rather sound . 
  plus , he had the merit of knowing when to step down ... this is why we did n't have another civil war in 1946 !, 
  too bad he did n't reign longer . 
  i see your point , and i agree . 
  however :  ( no clue about the abruzzi region , they are geographically center but culturally and economically south ) economically speaking , abruzzo is * way * better off than the south ; and the infrastructure too is on par with the rest of italy . 
  as for the the culture , well , that 's far more like the rest of central italy ( the dialect though is something strange that manages to sound both roman and neapolitan at the same time ) . 
  the only reason people tend to group it with the south is because istat does so . 
  and istat , in turn , is doing that just because once upon a time abruzzo was part of the kingdom of naples ... 
  i would love for italy to be a monarchy again ( but i certainly would ** not ** tolerate that crony , vittorio emanuele , or his illiterate son on the throne ) . 
  as mentioned above , article 139 of the constitution explicitly forbides it though : * the form of republic shall not be a matter for constitutional amendment . 
  * and it should be noted that a consistent majority of italians regard ( somewhat understandably ) the house of savoy with contempt , so there are not many chances to bring the monarchy back . 
  i used to live in a small hamlet in the far away backwoods of abruzzo , in central italy - a place so shitty even volwes refused to get anywhere near it . 
  population : some twenty people or so ( including myself ) during winter . 
  pros : * the landscape , with the mountains and all ; * the air is actually breathable , unlike rome ; * some of the architecture ; - the pros end pretty much here . 
  cons : * having to drive to a city some 27 kilometres away in order to find something fun to do on a saturday ; * having to drive to the nearest town for trivial things such as having a coffee or buying a packet of crisps ; * the dialect , which is a ridiculous caricature of a language spoken by creatures incapable of human speech ; * most of the girls left the place at the same time i hit puberty ; * everybody 's breath smelled of grappa ; * week-ends sucked donkey balls . 
  that 'd actually be an epithet used towards southerners ... 
   die begabung is this the german version of bunga bunga ? 
  then they could have been into something fishy , there 's no way you would n't press charges after that ... 
  grampa lost his three brothers in epyrus and russia , but was nevertheless posted with the royal ( italian ) navy until 1943 . 
  he was then discharged and met my grandma right before the germans occupied her village - she was being paid to clean uniforms for them !, 
  but then the allies came and she happened to be proposed by an american , with whom grandpa had an altercation and gave him a good beating before returning to rome . 
  grandma 's recently deceased sister hid two commonwealth soldiers from the nazis ... they gave her some money and a bar of chocolate as a token of gratitude . 
  she still had some kind of official document proving her efforts - and if i am not mistaken it bore gen. alexander 's signature - but i could n't take a good photograph of it as it was framed . 
  my other grandpa on the paternal side was drafted despite his profession ... one of his brothers , or his cousin ( i ca n't remember as i 've never met him in person ) was an anti-fascist who got imprisoned and had his properties seized . 
   [ ... ] or unpaid protection fee ( this is italy after all ) . 
  protection fee ? 
  unless you 're into something illegal ( say , prostitution ) or own one of those places in the city centre that might have a connection with organised crime , there is n't usually the danger of ` that kind of people ' coming after you ... and your car . 
  quite a few relatives own shops all over town , and not a single * mafioso * was ever spotted . 
  in ( parts of the ) south , however , the situation is different . 
  personally i do n't think it has got anything to do with romanians - indeed , lately lots of cars have been set on fire ( mainly in the city 's northern suburbs ) by one or more arsonists who have n't been caught yet . 
  as a whole ? 
  there are some smaller ones such as the venetian one or that of south tyrol , but as far as the latter is concerned they would paradoxically be better off by staying here - lest they lose all the free money courtesy of the government !, 
  venetian independence campaigners recently organised a referendum in which , of course , a good chunk of the voters turned out to be in favour of it ... perhaps unsurprisingly , the so-called ` referendum ' was nothing more than a sham online poll in which many votes came from known venetian heartlands such as germany and paraguay . 
  imho , these movements are a joke ( mostly ) . 
  roman here and yes , i 've been there yesterday out of sheer curiosity . 
  there were quite a few people but a significant part of the rally felt staged - the neo-fascists brought their very own team of stewards over who , as far as i could see , were too busy telling their supporters to wave their flags higher and boo a gal from the other party ( that 'd be giorgia meloni from * fratelli d'italia * , which is more moderate ) . 
  piazza del popolo was n't even * that * full actually , and the far-right supporters were told to get nearer to the podium when the cameras zoomed in !, 
  other than that it was little more than the usual trite , empty slogans - we all know they wo n't do anything once ( better , if ... ) they get in power . 
  they have ... ... as soon as they got wind of how many votes they could get simply by not shitting on the country 's other two thirds . 
  a parliament seat is a comfy place indeed , is n't it ?
