  & nbsp ; ** democratic party ** - formerly a leftist party , now just another avatar of the christian democracy of old . 
  matteo renzi is their lord and saviour and the pd is his personal fief ; their heads are so far up their arses they do n't see any contradiction in adopting right-wing economic policies that represent a u-turn from their previous positions . 
  beware , many a hipster has fallen for the charms and empty promises of the try-hard from rignano !, 
  & nbsp ; ** five-star movement ** - a bunch of cultish cloud-cuckoolanders with a penchant for moral fascism and authoritarian tendencies ( beppe grillo and his - actually not * really * his own - blog ) are the ultimate source of truth and whoever disagrees gets the stalin treatment . 
  they also like to rewrite facts to better suit their views and renege on prior declarations , * we 've - always-been-at-war-with-eastasia-style * . 
  they also do n't understand economics , or vaccines , or urban planning , or ... did i mention chemtrails ? 
  illuminazi bankers ? 
  reptilians ? 
  other assorted bollocks ? 
  its voters have an iq of less that 70 and will rabidly defend the party line to the death regardless of its validity . 
  your opinion otoh is automatically wrong because you 're not from the movement and if you do n't belong to the movement you 're an enemy of the people on the payroll of the bilderberg . 
  hell , i wish i was on the payroll of the bilderberg !, 
  & nbsp ; ** forza italia ** - whatever 's left of berlusconi 's party . 
  we 're still waiting for the old bastard to kick the bucket . 
  old people , gold-diggers hoping for a chance encounter with the silvio \u2122 and tax evaders flock to its ranks . 
  & nbsp ; ** the northern league ** - formerly an independentist ( but did anyone really buy that shit ? ), 
  party which recently shifted its focus of hate from southerners to immigrants . 
  btw yes , they do steal as much as anyone else . 
  surprise . 
  racist rednecks from the north and anyone who just wants to kick immigrants out of the country vote for them . 
  & nbsp ; the rest is a colourful if slightly irrelevant assortment of crypto-fascists , cassock-chasers and ex commies . 
  could n't find an english-language source , sorry !, 
  it 's army day , basically the italian equivalent of memorial day - albeit we used to commemorate victory in ww1 on that date . 
  the holiday in question was abolished and resurrected multiple times throughout the last 40 years . 
  yeah , sort of , and [ yes ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/giornata_dell%27unit%c3%a0_nazionale_e_delle_forze_armate ) . 
  kind of . 
  you 'd be surprised !, 
  sure , it can get freezing in the winter but vancouver is actually quite ok during summer . 
  i have a good friend from vancouver , which i plan on visiting again . 
  pretty cool place , it 's like america without any of the drawbacks ( bible thumpers , gun violence , lack of safety nets , ridiculous healthcare ) plus its gay scene and weed laws are ... huh ... much chiller than in italy ; both are * very * good bonuses for me . 
  not to mention the career opportunities , i can speak english and french so it 'd be very stupid of me not to give it a serious try . 
  there 's also australia but then again i only know that one from the * airport security * franchise . 
  though it 's admittedly very close - all i have to do is cross the brennero and voila !, 
  i 'm already in the fabled upside-down land of kangaroos , basements horrors , drop bears and mozart-themed chocolate genitalia . 
  i 'm tempted to say libya if it were n't such a dangerous country ? 
  just curious to see the place my dad grew up in . 
  i would also like to add argentina to the mix . 
  eerily familiar yet incredibly foreign at the same time . 
  [ gabriele d'annunzio ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/d%27annunzio ) , maybe ? 
  i can see why he could be considered a controversial figure abroad . 
  napoleon is not that well regarded in italy , either - he split venice and the whole north-east poland-style then gave it to the aussies ( ushering some 200 years of oppression ) so that he could fuck the emperor 's niece , looted the peninsula in order to enrich the louvre 's collection and turned his back on his very own supporters . 
  he was nothing short of a tyrant and a traitor . 
  the south was piss-poor well before that , though ... 
  same thing for the parts of lombardy bordering ticino , the * frontalieri * get to earn a swiss wage with an italian cost of life ; petrol is one of the few things that is actually cheaper in switzerland because of all the surcharges we have here . 
  none . 
  the language they teach you at school , or you can hear in films , is actually an artificial standard that no one speaks in real life - local varieties of italian ( think of something like uk accents ) being much more common . 
  in case you were wondering about rome , no , the local accent is definitely * not * standard even though the aforementioned pronunciation was partially based on it . 
  neither is the milanese one nor , to the surprise of many , the one you can hear in florence ... 
  more like immune to its consequences - female pickpockets get pregnant , they get caught and then released immediately because of the child . 
  they even carry ultrasounds in their purses for that purpose . 
  rinse and repeat for as many times as needed ... 
  pd , fi , the northern league and m5s . 
  deputies from the first party pretend not to steal anything yet they do it as much as the others combined ; the other party has no qualms whatsoever about stealing openly ( and has been for 20 + years ) ; the league is quite apt at embezzling money while screaming `` roma ladrona '' and the last one is made up by a bunch of cultish cloud-cuckoolanders with a penchant for fascism . 
  of course ; their favourite habitat is the city 's metro system . 
  you mostly see them stealing shit from other people ( including the wiring of streetlamps or manhole covers ) , littering , begging , starting wildfires and generally being a nuisance . 
  they 're also immune to law . 
  last time i checked the military interventions in afghanistan , iraq and ... whatever is going on in sirya all took place within the last fifteen years , if memory serves me well . 
  not to mention libya but that was more of a french/british mistake was n't it . 
  `` moderate rebels '' my arse !, 
  quite the liability if you ask me . 
  not just because of [ all the shit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strategy_of_tension ) it was indirectly responsible for during the 1940s and 1970s , but also because of its recent fuck-ups in africa and the middle east . 
  so yeah , i 'm not too happy of the role the u.s. played in my country or those near us ... 
  you 'd be surprised !, 
  it 's a race to the bottom over here . 
  today you have a job , tomorrow ... who knows ? 
  work days are monday to friday ; get to the workplace at 8:30 / 9:00 , expect a full hour ( actually 50 minutes , sometimes 45 ) for lunch at around 13:00 and then you 'd better stay for as long as the boss wants because unpaid overtime is one of the sacred principles that keep the motherland afloat . 
  a few former bosses of mine would also argue that turning off your phone for the night constitutes grounds for treason which should be punished by means of flogging , public decapitation or - worst case - a month without pay . 
  i wo n't even mention e-mails . 
  you want holidays ? 
  what else ? 
  a coffee and a blowjob ? 
  consider yourself lucky i 'm actually paying you !, 
  btw your paycheque is late this month . 
  got ta wait until the 15th . 
  tough shit but what can i do . 
  & nbsp ; * of course none of this applies if you 're a civil servant or in a highly unionised field . 
  do n't forget the likes of berlusconi , gasparri and scilipoti . 
  i do n't find that word particularly offensive , if at all ? 
  it 's rather neutral in italian . 
  yeah , mine 's an old house and i just ca n't let random guests know i grow my own pot can i. 
  he 's neapolitan ( and it shows ) . 
  no contest . 
  a veritable bunch of wankers , i 'm telling you . 
  hey !, 
  i know that one from ck2 !, 
  i just have to wear socks * and * slippers . 
  even in summer . 
  my feet tend to be terribly cold and sweaty , besides , i really do n't like them getting dirty anyway . 
  now you know [ what ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjay5vgiwt4 ) kind of [ shit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moqovwrr_ge ) us italians [ have to put up with ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsb8u014hs0 ) every summer . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oqertbey8c ) fucking [ guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm7qm3t8tis ) right [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htcqc5runcc ) ( girolamo panzetta aka giro-san ) . 
  he 's big in japan and korea but completely unknown in italy , or the rest of the world , for that matter ... 
  you forgot [ this little gem . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrlqbsd8lse ), 
  yup . 
  i 've actually had ( american , british ) tourists asking me for info in spanish ... :-(, 
  everytime sometimes tries to argue how latium or abruzzo are part of southern italy i die a little inside . 
  we 're * central * italy , folks . 
  we exist . 
  i swear !, 
  no , generally there are few of them and most are located in thermal towns ( e.g.
