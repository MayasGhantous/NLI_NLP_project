  anywhere in abruzzo and especially the little towns along the ss80 . 
  pietracamela , crognaleto , fano adriano , etc. , etc. 
  judging by the sheer number of sketchy chinese establishments that have popped up recently in which one can apparently get a `` massage with happiness '' , i 'd say very . 
  in case you were referring to ordinary spas , not much . 
  it 's wealthy people 's stuff . 
  definitely not uncommon - no one will bat an eyelid if you do n't drink . 
  and the mere act of getting pissed in public is still quite frowned upon , too , but then again we do n't even drink that much ( unless you are in the north-east ... ) . 
  anything . 
  apparently italy is too italian for most of them so they end up bitching about everyone and everything , as if they represented some ridiculous outpost of civilisation !, 
  i 'll agree about the horrid bureaucracy and that steamy pile of shite and that is our postal system ... even taxi drivers , though i was one not too long ago ... but still , most expats are a bunch of arseholes imho . 
  they come here expecting to live * la dolce vita * ( whatever that means ) surrounded by colourful caricatures of gesticulating , olive-skinned , wine-drinking italians eagerly awaiting to meet them and to act as a backdrop for their wanky journey of self-discovery then they get shocked to find out that the people here are pretty normal , do n't especially care for strangers ( let alone their kids ! ), 
  and have to work impossibly long hours for shit pay in a work environment that 's more reminiscent of colonial ethiopia . 
  seriously ? 
  i think ours is the wolf ? 
  anyhow , it 's a good reminder of just how happy we are to jump at each other 's throat . 
  wait a second ... how did they know american soldiers were circumcised ? 
  yes , an ordinary house the likes of which you can see in hollywood films . 
  not going to find one unless you move to the ( fairly depopulated ) countryside and even then , they tend to be old or the climate 's too shit for a swimming pool . 
  one exception are coastal towns where * villette * are all the rage but even there you 'd be more likely to find condos . 
  & nbsp ;  [ ... ] from the context i 'm guessing apartment is the standard living situation in your country & nbsp ; yeah , you 're right . 
  but what did you expect ? 
  we 've literally invented ~ ~ insulae ~ ~ condos ... 
  what colonies ? 
  / s we have a rocky relationship with libya : blaming italy and italians for any occurrence used to be a favourite pastime of theirs during the last regime plus my paternal family had all their properties , bank assets and social security contributions requisitioned before being expelled following gheddafi 's coup in 1970 . 
  therefore , they are n't too keen on `` that shithole '' and its people not least because we 've been waiting for compensation for almost 47 years now . 
  i mean - we were almost going to get some in 2009 but then 2011 happened ... thanks france ... eritrea ( they sure do love us down there !, 
  ) , ethiopia and somalia do n't exist and our government not only does a terrible job of teaching our colonial past but as a rule of thumb , likes to pretend we 've never had any colonies at all . 
  well , no . 
  not least because it 's unusual to have a detached house ( let alone a backyard ! ), 
  in the first place . 
  italy is not a `` pretty religious '' country , though , and has n't been since the 1970s . 
  true - it 's more on the culturally conservative side of things ( mostly ) but religion does n't actually have much to do with it and views/values can vary wildly between different generations . 
  are we ... ? 
  no , like , seriously ? 
  * something something mandatory school subject *, 
  sorry , mate , but i 'm definitely not the one with a chip on my shoulder here . 
  my god . 
  you northerners are masters at it , there 's no way a lowly provincial from rome could possibly beat you guys at your own game ... 
  i 'll also have you know that i 'd rather pass for a peasant than be forced to speak with the kind of effeminate , nasal accent you 're so fond of up there ; at least i do n't sound like a granola-munching fashionista who 's yet to hit puberty and unlike the lot of you , i do n't do my damnedest best to butcher italian grammar with gratuitous anglicisms or hideous constructs ( `` settimana prossima '' ? 
  who 's illiterate , again ? ) . 
  now please do the rest of the country a favour and go back to whatever glitzy turd of a city you crawled out from . 
  u/quirite over and out . 
  yes , your answer is not only very exhaustive but also quite the generalisation indeed . 
  thank you for having provided proof of your low character - whatever we might have done to you must 've been bad enough to leave such a mark on your delicate psyche and warrant such a bitter response , which is by no doubt indicative of some deep-seeded trauma . 
  so ... sorry for having stolen your girlfriend or whatever , mate !, 
  have a nice evening . 
  btw remember what they say about wankers ? 
  try not to touch yourself too much on your way out will you . 
  thank you very much for the gratuitous epithet . 
  it 's much appreciated . 
  may i enquire as to what actually caused you to have such a low opinion of 2.8 million of us ... ? 
  til i 'm attractive, 
  i live in a council flat located in a condo from the 1920s . 
  which means external plumbing , high ceilings , steep and slippery stairs with no lift ( those 90-year-old marble steps make for a very polished death trap ) . 
  it 's not far from my workplace ... 
  i 'm unemployed !, 
  [ here 's a view ] ( https://www.google.it/maps/@41.9459061,12.5340704,3a,75y,109.78h,98.18t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1snb024yq7pfsipfcfjkbgqg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) of my district and yes , those are all social housing blocks . 
  my old boss had all the file folders in my office renumbered so that they went from 16 to 16/bis . 
  rather often ; cars still cost a few millions , at least according to my family . 
  in rome , however , we also have quite a few eritrean and ethiopian restaurants . 
  ( mesob is particularly good !, 
  i would have loved to have been born and grown up in a swiss city like zuerich , basel or bern . 
  you know - the kind of place that 's reasonably clean , wealthy , efficient , quiet and where most importantly the people actually mind their own damn business . 
  cannelloni , pasta al forno and anything involving green beans . 
  i have traumatic memories of when my grandma forced me to eat those !, 
  they 're squishy and oily and taste like shit ... they 're only slightly worse than broccoli ... 
  most seafood is also pretty disgusting ( deep-fried calamari being the only exception ) . 
  back to back champs of peggiore ferrovia d'italia !, 
  i thought libero was just an e-mail provider ? 
  til . 
  `` our '' beach would be ostia , which is located some 30 km from rome proper . 
  *** il giornale *** ~ ~ would be ~ ~ no , actually very much is italy 's equivalent to the daily heil . 
  no further description needed . 
  *** il fatto quotidiano *** is a publication reserved to all those who believe that the movimento 5 stelle can do no wrong , and the kind of place where five star supporters can congregate to worship beppe grillo , our new prometheus , or denounce the evils of the illuminati/bilderberg/reptilians / democratic party/big pharma/silvio berlusconi by means of a collective struggle session . 
  *** il messaggero *** is a safe space for all those readers who enjoy spending their time lamenting the fate of rome . 
  as such , they would like `` that bitch of a mayor '' to do something about it for example by repairing potholes , increasing rubbish collection , flogging fare-dodgers , beheading pick-pockets or re-opening extermination camps for gypsies , immigrants and other `` undesirables '' . 
  *** l'unit\u00e0 *** is a newspaper that has been put out of its own misery multiple times , basically the kind of rag that nobody ever reads but which is kept on life support by public subsidies alone . 
  as such , it is to matteo renzi what the * pravda * used to be to the soviet politburo and its readers - assuming there are any - are very careful to toe the party line . 
  whatever that is . 
  *** repubblica *** is fake news with plenty of typos and we all know it . 
  & nbsp ; r/italy is a loose federation of stem-lords plus a bunch of assorted shills who get paid by the democratic party in order to fellate matteo renzi and organise cyber-attacks on web platforms owned by the m5s . 
  their main hobbies are downvoting things and getting triggered by food pics . 
  saying something nice about [ current government ] , now this is guaranteed land you in a whole world of trouble !, 
  jokes apart , in italy people tend to be quite ... * politically incorrect * so if the gubmint were to arrest anyone for some post on fb there 'd be a public uproar . 
  it 's only illegal-ish to deny the holocaust but as far as the rest is concerned you could go around rambling like a friggin ' klansman and not be bothered by the authorities ( you might get a broken nose , a black eye or something like that though ) . 
  defamation , on the other hand , is a whole other issue . 
  yeah , we also do that . 
  too bad we despised each other and have n't kept in touch . 
  to be fair , that 's not how it works in italy . 
  1 ) you make most of your real friendos during high school ; 2 ) universities have limited resources and are generally poorly connected with the private sector , so no internships unless you 're into a decent field like medicine or some other shit or you go to one of the fancy ( private ) universities and business schools ; 3 ) professors are the kind of arseholes who have to teach to huge numbers of students , they ca n't be bothered to remember your name or even care about whatever it is that you do . 
  italian unis are very much `` swim or sink '' - meaning that you 're all by yourself ; 4 ) no you do n't . 
  at least not here . 
  public universities have no special reputation therefore such kind of name-dropping would sound ridiculous , try doing that with your gymnasium ... `` oh , but i went to mcsomething high school !, 
  toughest school in the country i 'm telling you ! '' . 
  besides , it would be a bit complicated to hire fellow alumni , first because we do n't care about whichever uni you graduated from and secondly , but the sapienza is so huge ( 120.000 students/year ) that half of southern italy goes there . 
  hell no !, 
  in italy we pay high enough taxes and tuition , why would they want even more money to blow ? 
  they can frig off . 
  plus all those who happen to be wealthy enough to make a donation mostly flock * en masse * to the more prestigious , private universities anyway . 
  nope , no , not at all .
