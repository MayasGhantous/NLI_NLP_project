  if anything it 's the university which keeps pestering you years after graduation with stupid surveys and shit ... you also have to consider that 1 ) italy 's still a country of high school diploma holders , mainly 2 ) most of our unis are run-down , not to mention terribly uncool and boring and 3 ) we just want the study bullshit to be over in order to never think about it ever again . 
  close enough to the present day , plus i get to have a second chance at life . 
  i 'd do things differently and start with actually studying/doing my homework ... 
  we did ? 
  i do n't think anyone knows the lyrics save for the first two stanzas . 
  and we certainly did n't learn them at school , albeit they only started teaching these around 2012-ish ? 
  i remember it was a controversial move at the time . 
  nope . 
  first you 'd need to be an italian citizen , then have an extremely good command of the language allowing to waddle through the legalese in order even know about eventual openings and lastly , you 'd have to pass a series of ridiculously difficult exams . 
  you 'd be also competing with thousands of job-hungry southerners ... so no . 
  not much . 
  hell , most people over here only have a high school diploma and an awful lot of folks over the age of 50 can boast the * middle * school equivalent , which up until the 1980s was more than enough to find a job . 
  i think less than half of young people here have a bachelor 's degree or even bother enrolling at a university ( i did n't - went straight to work the very day i turned 18 but in my defence , i 've always been a terrible student and flunked high school multiple times ) . 
  to be fair , we only visited ( surprise surprise ... ) london . 
  mostly . 
  plenty of italians in there . 
  i 'm glad to hear that about the carpet thing but i must admit i was surprised to find out your homes are even smaller than ours somehow !, 
  the food in britain can be edible and , sometimes , even palatable provided you know where to look and pay attention into avoiding all italian-themed places ; in fact , i had one of the best meals of my life at a vietnamese joint in soho . 
  also - i was shocked at just how much polite the subway/railway workers and policemen were ? 
  had i asked the very same questions in italy they would 've probably told me to fuck off while pointing a gun ( the lack of which i found slightly disconcerting ) in my general direction . 
  not to mention the british love for carpeted bathrooms ... btw just how many fucking italians are there ? 
  you ca n't walk into a pub or a caf\u00e9 without having to deal with an italian waiter . 
  and why does the automated teller at tesco hate me ? 
  what are those `` stones '' you speak of ? 
  how can it be acceptable to be drunk and puking at 6 pm ? 
  and how could anyone enjoy walking around half-naked on nye ? 
  lastly , i want to say i am sorry ; i thought i knew english but i really did n't understand jack-shit most of the time . 
  you mean neapolitans ? 
  we 're used to them . 
  you mean pre-euro ? 
  because we 've quite literally founded the eu . 
  anyway , yes , life as far as i can remember was generally better in the 1990s ... just ask my father ... but then again we still had lots of problems ( the ludicrous pension system , even worse debt , locked democracy , even more useless state entities , fiat getting public subsidies at the tune of 200.000 * billion * lire over thirty years , etc. ), 
  which we 've only had to deal with relatively recently . 
  life before the euro was fun - but definitely unsustainable . 
  did n't help when shopkeepers took advantage of the new conversion rate in order to to quadruple prices !, 
  i 've only met a few of them and it was mainly argentinians , with the odd russian here and there . 
  but then again most italian universities are barely able to keep native italian students from leaving , let alone attract foreigners ... on the other hand we get lots of americans but they are a special bunch in that they sincerely believe they 've come here to learn our language and culture but they end up in their own american universities , study their courses in the english language , hang out with other english speakers and so on . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  not much ; possibly not at all . 
  foreigners always have this weird assumption about cheerful italians enjoying * la dolce vita * ( i just threw up a little attempting to type that ) but in fact , the exact opposite is true . 
  we 're a miserable bunch . 
  a classy but old-fashioned kind of liquor ? 
  i can almost picture a sleazy lothario wannabe from the 1970s ordering a glass of cognac while burning money in bitches and blow at some swanky night-club in the costa smeralda . 
  how is the current system any worse than the one you are proposing ? 
  sure , the ssn could use a bit more funding but i 'm getting top-dollar treatment ( at a public hospital , mind you ) that would otherwise be either unavailable or for which i 'd have to pay out of my own pocket - and who knows just how fucking much it may have ended up costing me . 
  what are your reasons for wishing such a thing upon the rest of us , again ? 
  & nbsp ;  yeah because all those countries in europe that follow the bismark model and have consistently better healthcare have such a prehistoric system , right ? 
  & nbsp ; please !, 
  our system is not the mess you make it to be and you know it . 
  besides , no , i do n't want to end up in the kind of country where you can either choose private coverage or be stuck with the basic state plan and be treated as a second-class patient . 
  fuck that shit . 
  if you like insurance companies so much move to the u.s and enjoy the free market ... better yet , stay here . 
  all you have to do is to get involved in a car accident first and see for yourself just how smoothly they work . 
  & nbsp ;  [ ... ] we should also get rid of the national healthcare system altogether , replacing it with a multi-payer system . 
  & nbsp ; as someone who 's been suffering from kidney trouble , no thanks !, 
  you 'd only send the country some 40 years back and besides , i 'd rather have my ssn funded by taxes than to be subjected to the kind of shenanigans insurance cartels are known for ... and considering the way car insurance companies operate here , i would n't want them to `` take care '' of my health as well . 
  there were many good reasons for the * mutue * to go the way of the dodo , i 'm glad they got rid of them . 
  ( not least because they all went bankrupt !, 
  i think we should just abolish regions altogether ... they 're useless and , all things considering , kind of artificial ( e.g. 
  northern latium and umbria are basically interchangeable whereas the southern-most part of the region has got more in common with campania than rome , or even the roman castles ) . 
  provinces are much more representative imho . 
  i 'm all for further centralisation - all attempts at devolution have been utter failures ( most of these legislative atrocities having been enacted for political gainz by the berlusconi administration in order to appease the yokels belonging to the northern league of old ) and only generated further waste of taxpayer money/bureaucracy/confusion . 
  there should only be provinces , * comuni * and some revised form of the administrative abomination currently known as * citt\u00e0 metropolitane * . 
  the ssn would be supervised and run directly by the ministry of health , as it used to be . 
  ** trentino-alto adige ** would be split , with the province of trento being stripped of its autonomy and the one in bolzano keeping most of its prerogatives ; ** sicily ** too would be stripped of its autonomy and only the provinces would continue to exist , as in the rest of the mainland ; the ** val d'aosta ** stays unchanged . 
  i 'd advocate almost the same treatment for ** sardinia ** and ** friuli ** , with sardinian and friulian being taught in the provinces belonging to the former regions along with slovenian in the ones near the border . 
  ** molise ** woulds ' t exist for real , a single province in campobasso is enough !, 
  ofc rome gets to be an autonomous entity , a g7 capital ca n't be subjected to the whims and wits of the lazio region . 
  my own birth took place via c-section ... that stork was taking so fucking long my mother would 've been better off using the italian postal system to deliver me !, 
  my parents were so grateful i ended up taking the doctor 's name and 25 years later i was delighted to learn i had been named after an embezzler and money launderer ( guy 's in jail now ) . 
  but yes , i think they have always a doctor on hand at the hospital . 
  yes , but do they weigh at least 90 kg and can be shot at over 300 metres ? 
  to be fair i did n't even know they had football over there . 
  i mean - hockey ? 
  sure . 
  that other weird sport with fishing nets on sticks ? 
  yeah . 
  football ? 
  mmmh ... 
  like basements ? 
  & nbsp ;  how much do you guys use the flag of your respective countries ? 
  & nbsp ; never , unless our football team somehow manages not to disappoint some 60 million people . 
  & nbsp ;  and what is your relationship to it ? 
  & nbsp ; in the end it 's just a piece of cloth ; the * state 's * own piece of cloth , and the people 's too but to a lesser degree . 
  & nbsp ; appendix - if you 're shameless enough to find it acceptable to frolick around with 1 ) a savoy-blue tracksuit plastered with italia in all-caps ; 2 ) football jerseys with the italian flag on them or 3 ) our flag anywhere on your clothes i can guarantee 100 % that you 're a gypsy , a tourist or one of * those * italian-americans . 
  yes , i 'm referring to the orange kind . 
  malus points if you dare to sport a shirt with [ one of those horrid , geographically-inaccurate shapes of italy ] ( https://s14-eu5.ixquick.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?ref=https%3a%2f%2fwww.pinterest.com%2fpin%2f523965737880017286%2f&amp;ua=tw96awxsys81ljagkfgxmtsgvtsgtgludxggaty4njsgzw4tvvm7ihj2ojeuos4xljcpiedly2tvlziwmdkxmjixiezpcmvmb3gvnduuma&amp;uadata=47b706c4fb70d4f25ec8e7db0a3dc93a&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fs-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%2foriginals%2f06%2fc1%2f09%2f06c109114b47b1789a469e2ab4c67ce7.jpg&amp;sp=10400c638705cea2b3bc4894a47e7c9d&amp;f=3cb09bf14868119eb347ad62086fde90.jpg ) usually missing sardinia or some other place ... then you deserve to be arrested on the spot and deported asap !, 
  appendix/2 - if you fly it and there 's no football match going on then you 're either a fascist , a demagogue or both . 
  appendix/3 - imho our flag looks garish and empty without the coat of arms ( not the soviet one ! ), 
  on it . 
  roman here , and the answer is ... not much . 
  municipal bureaucrats are an untouchable caste of useless ( not to mention rude ) cunts who only got there thanks to someone else 's patronage ... as for the traffic cops , they 're another bunch of arseholes who are nowhere to be seen for the better part of the day unless they need to levy a fine ; god forbid you have an accident with a person who happens to hail from the same little shithole said copper is from . 
  you 're gon na get screwed , big time . 
  getting * elected * does n't seem to be difficult , though - if a fascist thug , a neurosurgeon and now the administrative calamity going under the name of virginia raggi managed to get elected as mayor of rome then so could i. 
  but * i * would need money !, 
  or at the very least the backing of some big-name party , and that 's not going to happen . 
  we do n't . 
  we used to have a similar holiday , the 4th of november , until a few decades ago but nowadays the president just stands in front of a wreath before the parade ( or whatever 's left of it ) on ~ ~ vote rigging ~ ~ republic day starts ... ... so no , we do n't . 
  not least because we have a * big * problems coming to terms with our not-so-recent history . 
  & nbsp ; edit : what veterans ?
