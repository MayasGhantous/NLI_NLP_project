  italy has one of the finest selections of far-right scum in the whole continent . 
  casapound , fn ( forza nuova : not to be confused with the more famous french party ) , and the like ... they 're all small enough but troublesome and idiotic . 
  & nbsp ;  do they do anything besides holding rallies ? 
  & nbsp ; of course they do !, 
  casapound , like most neo-fascist groups , are very found of random beatings and they like targeting innocent bystanders - especially if they happen to be gay or too `` left wing '' for their taste . 
  them cowards like to gang up on people so that they can be sure to win . 
  rome is not the south !, 
  central italy best italy !, 
  reeeeeeeee but yes , they do feel the same as the rest of us in that regard . 
  i agree fully with what you said . 
  afaik the army tends to be dangerously top-heavy ... too many big brasses with a * very * fat paycheque and time to kill ( just look at my former boss ' husband , he was technically still in service but spent almost every day at his wife 's shop ) but not enough grunts . 
  i 'm also in favour of reintroducing conscription . 
  let 's give 18-year-olds something to do , and pay them for it ; at the end of the * naja * most of them still wo n't find a job , granted , but at the very least they 'll spend six months learning useful shit and generally becoming adult . 
  also - while i think the f35 to be an expensive mistake just like the ariete , at the very least it 's going to replace four different types of ( now obsolete ) aircrafts whose maintenance has long turned into a logistical nightmare . 
  did you just assume my southern italian-ness ? 
  how dare you ?!, 
  ( anyway , no , i 'm roman and the phobia of wind is pretty much universal here ) . 
  crusader kings 2 obviously !, 
  closely followed by hearts of iron iii , then europa universalis iii and ii ... personally i would also include fahrenheit in the list . 
  other vidyagames i really liked were call of juarez ( devs are polish ) and stalker , especially clear sky . 
  but what about the silent hunter franchise ? 
  if i 'm not mistaken those should count as european games . 
  the first mafia and hidden & dangerous 2 ( both czech ) were reeeeeally good games too . 
  & nbsp ; i know , i 'm old . 
  gusts of wind are the source of an untold number of aches and with time they can - actually , will !, 
  - kill you . 
  you should n't get rid of your coat until mid-may and god forbid you happen to take a seat next to an open window ... or else . 
  do n't even think about sitting on the floor , walking without your socks on , or leaving home with wet hair . 
  ( britain is where your average italian 's worst health-related nightmares and concerns take shape ) . 
  the late [ giulio andreotti ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giulio_andreotti ) fit this description to a t. we 're not even sure he 's really dead , either . 
  berlusconi tried to follow in his footsteps but got expelled from parliament at the tender age of 77 . 
  & nbsp ;  littoral - mona 's ( inside joke ) [ ... ] & nbsp ; does that mean what i think it means ? 
  not that it would surprise me , i swear i 've heard quite a few slovenes swearing in italian . 
  i 'm sure they do spend their holidays here - just not in the place i used to work at . 
  and even if they did i would 've probably mistaken them for germans , unless they showed me their passports . 
  to be fair i 've never had to deal with austrians on holiday ... 
  i have an australian landlord , and he 's stark raving mad ( when he 's not high on barbiturates ) . 
  apart from him the ones i met were pretty much ok save for that one dude in a tour group who wanted to walk the entire length of the city on foot because he wanted to buy baby clothes , even though he did n't have any babies ... only met a few kiwis and all they wanted to talk about was rugby . 
  pretty chill otherwise . 
  same thing in rome . 
  just go to campo de ' fiori at night ; there 's some primal shit going on . 
  especially when pub crawls and party hostels are involved . 
  think magaluf is bad ? 
  you should see kavos . 
  ** russians ** are just rude . 
  like , * real * rude - even by roman standards . 
  and kind of crass . 
  the ** dutch ** do n't seem to have a filter between brain and mouth . 
  i appreciate honesty , but come on ... ** danes ** tend to have kind of a smug and demeaning attitude - just seek a swede and learn how to chill . 
  ** chinese ** like to form tight legions and march from landmark to landmark , stomping everything in their path . 
  ** americans ** like to discuss their sex lives in public and in varying degrees of detail yet keep forgetting that we too understand english . 
  they also have a worrying tendency to drink too much and fall from high places , or get hit by trains ; whenever this happens ( roughly every summer ) their media wo n't miss the chance to jump at us . 
  ** brits ** like to spend much of their time getting shitfaced and screaming obscenities , or getting sunburnt and screaming obscenities , or getting pissed and sunburnt and behaving inappropriately while screaming obscenities at coppers . 
  ** germans ** are nice enough if a bit too cold ( provided there are n't important football matches involved that is ) . 
  ** spaniards ** could n't speak english to save their lives and this is coming from an italian !, 
  the ** french ** are ok but they could ... try to smile a bit more and throw a few thank yous here and there ? 
  ** belgians ** have a bad habit of asking for info and then just walk away . 
  what the fuck . 
  ** greek ** tourists ( they exist ) are pretty chill but think no one on the bus can understand them . 
  i do . 
  ** canadians ** are * lovely * . 
  everybody likes canadians . 
  they 're perfect . 
  how could you not like them ? 
  ** swedes ** too are very pleasant and sometimes rather outgoing . 
  i could n't believe it . 
  & nbsp ; other italians are annoying because they 're not from here and are therefore incompatible with the roman mindset ; northerners complain too much , southerners end up clogging our universities and driving rents through the roof . 
  also , my accent 's not silly - yours is . 
  and both of yous fail at pronouncing vowels properly . 
  we invented vowels so shut up . 
  it sure is , [ a lot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiat_tagliero_building ) [ of its pre-war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/governor%27s_palace,_asmara ) [ buildings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cinema_impero ) are still intact somehow . 
  eritrea ? 
  asmara is basically `` littlest italy '' and i found the elders quite eager to practice their italian . 
  my family on the paternal side used to live in libya ( dad was born there ) until 1970 and from what i gather tripoli - do n't know about the rest of the country - still has plenty of italian influence . 
  so do the cuisine and libyan arabic . 
  somalia too used to be like that , at least until 1991 , but who the hell knows what it 's like these days !, 
  you either pack your own lunch or out at the bar you go , canteens are almost non-existent here . 
  when you 're not bringing your own food ( rice , pasta , salads , fruit ... ) you have sandwiches/pizza/kebap . 
  well , he 's a great coach and the reason we won the * scudetto * in 2001 !, 
  edit : nevermind , wrong zeman ... 
  yup . 
  swedish actually has a very ... uhm ... `` rhythmic '' feel to it , for lack of a better description . 
  for those who attended a gymnasium , it sounds like someone [ reading latin poetry in hexameters ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rqwoilzlym ) . 
  tv tropes would probably define italy as the text-book example of a `` crapsaccharine world '' . 
  just imagine living in one of the most stagnant countries in the whole wide world , one which has been in a perpetual state of crisis for as long as anybody can remember . 
  there are few jobs ; most of those jobs are little more than shitty gigs provided by shitty employers ; you probably will never be offered a proper contract or have your social security contributions paid ; the hours are long ( hi mandatory unpaid overtime ! ), 
  and the wages ridiculously low ( they have n't changed since 1995 ) ; and you will never ever own a home unless you 're lucky enough to inherit one , too . 
  politicians need a reality check and yet they refuse to recognise the state of things ; everyone 's been busy pumping out reforms after reforms but things are n't improving . 
  justice is a joke and there are , in fact , too many immigrants . 
  they 've been slashing social security , education , healthcare spending , military spending , and ... just about everything but their salaries . 
  thanks to the wealth accumulated by the previous generations life 's still kind of confortable ; society feels stifling ( it 's a country for old people after all ) . 
  you wo n't end up homeless but there is really no future . 
  we 've been waiting for the `` big one '' to come , bring everything down and finally put this country out of its misery . 
  heh , the alto adige/south tyrol is a pretty good example !, 
  but trentino too barely feels like italy , at times ; trento and rovereto have to be among the cleanest ( and quietest ) towns i 've ever seen . 
  quite an eerie experience if you ask me . 
  from our very own pov , apart from the afore-mentioned istria , there is also the italian-speaking part of switzerland ... just do n't remind them of the fact that they 're like the rest of us suckers on the other side the border or else . 
  bonus mention for tripoli and mogadiscio - albeit these are n't exactly countries ( let alone neighbouring ones ) and no longer resemble the little italies in the way they used to until the 1970s , when libyan/somalian-italians still lived there . 
  if you 're looking for that kind of feelz you should visit eritrea ; the resemblance can be uncanny at times . 
  even more bonus points for italy 's very own version of hong kong , tientsin .
