  yup . 
  they still do that from time to time . 
  but then again , it 's utter shite of a programme !, 
  you mean striscia la notizia ? 
  imho gratuitous nudity in ` bawdy ' tv shows/comedies ( and i 'm not just referring to the kind of programmes aired by privately-owned tvs ... ) used to be ubiquitous until the 1990s . 
  it 's been toned down * a lot * from what i can tell . 
  excellent , now please gib job and numbered bank account . 
  hold my beer , i 'm going in !, 
  of course not !, 
  everybody knows about the proclamation of the kingdom of italy . 
  all the roads lead to rome , true , but none of them allow you to get out of it . 
  poof !, 
  i have been summoned ... 
  i 'm sure that place is piazza venezia ; you ca n't avoid it if you 're going to the other side of the city by car , the only viable alternatives being the ever-clogged * lungotevere * or the ring road . 
  it 's also the very centre of the centre . 
  once i tried to buy a packet of crisps at the vatican supermarket ( annona ) . 
  turns out it 's for employees only , you have to slide your badge at check-out !, 
  rai is a giant pile of overly-politicised shite whose journalists get paid handsomely to fellate whomever is in power . 
  btw , no , the `` tv tax '' is a ridiculous gimmick that makes no sense in 2017 ; despite all the taxpayer money flowing we still get an awful lot of commercials ( plus most of the programming is aimed at an audience of 90-year-old farts ) . 
  i got rid of my tv so that i did n't have to pay the damn fee to those incompetent fat-cats ... 
  pretty sure op was also describing italy 's work culture . 
  worrying ... 
  if it 's a sunday , off to fiumicino we go !, 
  it 's our [ fried squid ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/e2/70/c6/calamari-fritti-al-cartoccio.jpg ) & beer day . 
  then we hit the beach and have a look at the ladies ... if it 's any other day then my activities sure as hell include getting up at 10 , having a scrumptious breakfast at the bar and dicking around with my friends usually at a park , the city centre , shopping precinct or something . 
  evenings are for pizzas and vidyagames , injecting marijuanas and/or getting shitfaced at the pub . 
  of course he was n't , whenever things went bad he just switched parties . 
  ( btw adua was his fault ) . 
  greatest : camillo benso , conte di cavour . 
  worst : everyone who came after him . 
  but especially the balding hothead from predappio , the shady hunchback motherfucker , that other shady fucker from milan , the idiot from florence and now the cult leader from genoa . 
  what did little liechtenstein ever do to you ? 
  she 's going to be 2770 years old this april ... 
  do n't forget to ask them if they can annex us on a week-day !, 
  preferably on a monday , possibly between 8:30 and 18:30 ... ? 
  mmmmh . 
  tough call . 
  i do n't quite care for the rest of europe , and the swiss franc would be better than the lira , so ... yea ? 
  i , for one , welcome our new swiss overlords . 
  i `` expatriate '' whenever i need to buy my meds at the vatican pharmacy ( everything 's 20/25 % off ) . 
  the only thing you ca n't get there are condoms but , hey , i 'm a redditor so it 's not like i 'm going to need those anytime soon . 
  :-( wish i could use the vatican supermarket , tobacconist and petrol station as well - they have one and it 's just as vat-free - but these are for employees only . 
  i 'd also like to get the chance to work in the vatican city ; museum staff get paid $ 3000/month and they have no payroll taxes whatsoever . 
  my cousin got lucky and now he cleans toilets there , paycheque 's a whopping thousand quid ( and something ) a month but that 's pretty noice all things considered . 
  priests and the bs they preach i ca n't stand and in that regard vatican city is , well , some friggin ' laundering scheme established by a certain balding tyrant asshole looking for cheap approval from the populace . 
  as far as the pope is concerned , he can frig off for all i care but if he 's the one paying my bills then i 'm more than okay with him . 
  lastly ... these priestly hypocrites and money launderers have no fucking business in italian politics !, 
  i would n't consider d'annunzio a divisive figure ; at least not anymore . 
  most people only know his literary works because they had to study them at school , his war exploits ( which are generally seen in a positive light ) or his ... * interesting * sex life . 
  but otherwise he lived a full century ago - too much to really be considered controversial . 
  atac drivers already get paid handsomely for loitering , striking and generally not showing up on time . 
  i mean , do i even have to thank them for their ( dis ) service on top of all that ? 
  and why would one go around thanking random people anyway ? 
  & nbsp ; oh boy , where do i even start ... & nbsp ; * a classic : ** north ** vs ** south ** vs ** centre ** but the latter only happens whenever they remember we exist , too . 
  * ** rome ** vs ** milan ** ; ** rome ** vs ** naples ** ; ** rome ** vs all them savages who happen to `` live '' past the sacred confines of the ring-road . 
  especially the rest of ** latium ** ( * burini * with an iq in the single digits emitting ape-like grunts ) . 
  * speaking of whom ... ** cassino ** ( mountain-dwellers , not neapolitans ) vs ** formia ** ( actual neapolitans and * pesciaroli * ) ; ** latina ** ( * cispadani * , northerners in disguise descended from the glorious aryan race ) vs the rest of *** southern *** latium ( * marocchini * who live in caves or hovels unlike the more civilised - and recent !, 
  - inhabitants of the plains ) . 
  *** northern *** latium : ** viterbo ** barely exists , ** rieti ** definitely does n't . 
  ever met someone from rieti ? 
  * *** northern *** rome ( poshy , arrogant , effete pronunciation , desperately tries to hide any trace of romanness ; daddy 's a doctor or a lawyer or an asshole and bought you one of those girly 500s you ca n't drive for shit ) vs *** southern *** rome ( the plebeian masses live there ) vs rome *** east *** ( basically the third world ) vs ** ostia ** ( literally the mafia ) . 
  city centre ? 
  what 's that ? 
  and above all , are we sure * there 's such a thing as rome west ? 
  * * ** milan ** vs ** naples ** ; ** naples ** vs rest of the country ( it gets especially bad in the salento during summer ) . 
  * ** palermo ** vs ** catania ** vs ** messina ** ( who 'd ya call * buddaci * eh ? ), 
  vs poor , lawless , backwards ** calabria ** . 
  * other big island that 's not sicily or corsica : ** cagliari ** vs ** sassari ** . 
  but what is this ** gallura ** you speak of ? 
  * ** livorno ** vs ** pisa ** ; ** florence ** vs ** pisa ** ; ** lucca ** vs ** pisa ** ; ** pisa ** vs ** tuscany ** ; ** tuscany ** vs itself . 
  * ** pescara ** vs ** chieti ** ( stingy people with an attitude ) . 
  the seaside is civilised , the mountains are n't . 
  * ** molise ** is an alternative fact but the gubmint keeps peddling its existence . 
  as such , it ca n't have rivalries . 
  * ** emilia ** ( pinkos , fog , rice paddies ) vs ** romagna ** ( sun , sea , easy women ) . 
  of course romagna wins . 
  vs ** trieste ** ; etc. 
  & nbsp ; * bonus football bantz : ** a.s. roma ** ( `` it ai n't our fault !, 
  all referees are biased cucks ! '' ), 
  vs ** lazio ** ( fascist redneck losers with delusions of grandeur and racist tendencies ) ; ** a.s. roma ** vs ** napoli ** ( vandals in the street , crybabies in the field ) ; ** hellas verona ** vs any other team with black players ; the entire ** serie a ** vs ** juventus ** . 
  everybody hates them cheating hunchbacks , there 's a reason if their uniforms have black and white stripes !, 
  hundreds , even ; a couple thousand nation-wide . 
  surprisingly enough it 's not just old people , either ... there 's plenty of guys and * feeeeeemales * my age ( i 'm 25 for the records ) in there . 
  imagine my face when i discovered that !, 
  :-p monarchist movements used to be much more relevant , there was even one such parties in parliament . 
  i had n't noticed . 
  :-) & nbsp ;  [ ... ] never have been to the italian parts of svitzerland wats up with them ? 
  & nbsp ; well , think of the northern league - just worse . 
  imho they 're a cesspit of unpleasantness . 
  to give you an idea , * il mattino * makes * der stuermer * look good ... 
  & nbsp ; nice try , but italian does not have inverted exclamation marks ... they 're a spanish thing . 
  btw no one - and i say no one - wants to have to deal with the ticinese ; as long as they stick to their side of the border it 's all fine and dandy . 
  ticino is thus righful swiss clay . 
  other notable points of contention are : & nbsp ; 1 ) friuli and part of the so-called venezia giulia are already , well , in italy ; 2 ) malta otoh has never been part of italy and most people would n't normally give a fuck about it , except when it comes to the yearly debate about who gets to pick the migrants ( but 1934 is still a rotten trick anyhoo !, 
  ) ; 3 ) what you call `` dalmatia '' was actually just the province of zara that is , the town and its immediate environs ; 4 ) there may be or have been a case for istria but that 's a ~ ~ literal can of worms ~ ~ very delicate issue ; 5 ) nizza and corsica are french and have been for 300/150 years , cores have long expired . 
  & nbsp ; points 3 and 4 however are no laughing matter , especially among older italians and the * esuli * . 
  easy !, 
  we 've only had four monarchs , and they were : vittorio emanuele ii ( 1861-78 ) , umberto i ( 1878-1900 ) , vittorio emanuele iii ( 1900-46 ) , umberto ii ( may/june 1946 ) . 
  the current heir to the italian throne - due to a bunch of legal , dynastical and inheritance shenanigans i wo n't be explaining in this post - is aimone di savoia-aosta . 
  he 's also the only one who 's officially recognised as such by the u.m.i. , so there 's also that to consider .
