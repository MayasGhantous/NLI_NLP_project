  sauce : am monarchist ... 
  easy there , dual is a walk in the park compared to the fuckery that are [ russian cardinal numbers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_declension#declension_of_cardinal_numerals ) . 
  they 're the reason i stopped learning russian in the first place ... 
  yes ... and no . 
  but mostly yes . 
  while the main political parties are pretty much interchangeable ( save for a few key issues ) here , the dichotomy is still felt on a more ` popular ' level . 
  and it begins early , too ; everybody becomes a wannabe `` communist '' or a wannabe `` fascist '' within the first year of high school . 
  then of course you grow out of such edgy teen shite but the general orientation tends to stick until later in life . 
  most young adults regain their sanity upon graduation . 
  so if you want to insult & discredit your opponent , covertly suggest that they 're the kind of baby-eating pinko traitors/goose-stepping thugs with a penchant for arson you would never want to associate with ; if all you want is to spice up your social life with an argument , see where a person 's political loyalties * really * lie or find an excuse to cut all contact with your extended family , just ask them what they think about the 25th of april . 
  works every time !, 
  do n't forget to bring the popcorn and , possibly , some backup . 
  slovenian has a dual number !, 
  i had n't seen something like that since the days i was studying ancient greek at the gymnasium ... 
  come to think of it , yep , she does !, 
  so do i. 
  but most of us do n't look like the stereotypical caricature of a ( southern ) italian you see in films . 
  [ mario monti !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mario_monti ) there used to be a lot of fun facts about him back in 2012-ish . 
  & nbsp ; `` mario monti is so professional he congratulated his own mother when she gave birth to him '' . 
  `` jesus walked on water . 
  chuck norris walked on jesus . 
  mario monti made both of them pay the toll '' . 
  `` when mario monti 's nephews go to bed , he rolls up their sleeves and kisses them good-night '' . 
  to be fair , we eat them too . 
  my grandma waits for the snails to pop up after the rain , goes on a collecting spree , puts them in a bag and then she boils them alive !, 
  and they make such nasty noises in the pot , it 's just ... eeewww . 
  same thing for italy ( i blame hollywood for that ) . 
  ca n't help but cringe whenever i see an american film set here ... 
  my ideal job is to be employed as a bureaucrat at some big , labyrinthine government agency and getting paid to make photocopies of photocopies , waste time on reddit or shoot the shit with colleagues m-f from 9 to 5 . 
  i 'm veeery lazy . 
  just kidding ( but not that much ! ) . 
  i have a high school diploma - classical studies , so it 's basically useless - and am currently employed at a travel agency `` thanks '' to the youth guarantee programme . 
  now studying industrial chemistry ... salary is technically 600 $ a month but i only get half of it from my employer ; i get the other half every * three * months from the local government . 
  this arrangement sucks ballz and i 'm trying to bail ship asap . 
  i mean , rome 's fine for visiting . 
  living here , on the other hand . . 
  of course we do , we live rome after all !, 
  we 've got the freshest , tastiest and overall bestest water in the whole wide world ... if you do n't mind kidney stones or pissing bricks that is . 
  there 's definitely too much calcium in it . 
  & nbsp ;  rome [ ... ] too many tourists [ ... ] & nbsp ; i honestly would n't worry about it if op 's planning to work and stay here ; all the real jobs ( assuming there are any ) are elsewhere - hell , most of our 2.8 million lives take place somewhere that 's not the city centre . 
  what tourists see and experience is only a small fraction , the very core of the old town ( which fyi is almost totally devoid of locals nowadays ) so neither op nor the ordinary romans would be interacting with them anyway . 
  sad but true . 
  ca n't help but chuckle whenever i read of americans who want to come here to study italian ... they 're going to stay in their own , english-speaking colony that is the historical centre and will probably never meet an actual roman . 
  as a roman myself the only suggestion i can give you is not to move to rome if you value the quality of your life . 
  you 'd be surprised to learn just how much of a drab , congested * and * jo ( y ? 
  ) bless backwater it actually is . 
  not sure italy has one ... what about southern latium ? 
  we 're currently transitioning from manufacturing to biomedical/aerospace but still , [ latina ] ( http://www.prodottipontini.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/latina.jpg ) and [ pomezia ] ( http://pomezia-eventi.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pomezia-creative-commons.jpg ) have such a depressing atmosphere you could cut the depression with a knife . 
  then there 's ** mestre ** ( formerly home to one of the biggest chemical plants in europe ) and ** taranto ** ( same but with steel ) . 
  if it were n't for the navy the latter would be a * total * shithole , complete with poisonous fumes . 
  i would also classify ** potenza ** as such - it 's the ugliest city in italy but hey , they got oil fields !, 
  ** carbonia ** is a former mining town in sardinia and now one of the poorest provinces in the country . 
  also , ** terni ** ... once an industrial city renowned for its arsenal / arms factories and now just , ugh . 
  nope , no , not at all . 
  socrates lashes out at the corrupt journalists who always forget his enemies ' misdeeds ; during a speech in the agora , he denounces the `` commie '' prosecutors who hate him because of his guts , then pledges to drink the poison but recants everything and runs for prime minister . 
  twenty-five years later , he gets acquitted of all charges . 
  also his disciples are definitely * not * underage , the niece of the egyptian pharaoh is actually the one to blame as she said she was 18 but was n't and looked , like , 30 ? 
  he also never said he would drink the damn poison , the communists - especially that asshole meletus who 's just envious 'cause socrates gets loads of poon and he does n't - fabricated everything ( fake news , i 'm telling you ) . 
  what ? 
  where did he find the money to start three philosophical schools ? 
  that 's none of your damn business !, 
  * roma sotterranea * offers some pretty interesting underground tours , the bunkers are well worth it !, 
  both mussolini 's and the king 's wartime shelters ( i mean the ones located beneath the villa torlonia , palazzo venezia and villa ada ) have been restored and should now be open to the public . 
  so is the one beneath termini station . 
  have n't been to rome , or sicily , i see . 
  last time i went to siracusa the weather was 45 degrees ; 40 are n't that unusual in rome . 
  yeah , we call it `` august '' . 
  yes , it 's the * accademia della crusca * - and it inspired the establishment of the acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise !, 
  but it does n't have any official standing ; despite it having a very long history ( it was founded in 1583 ) the accademia does not serve any real purpose and is severely underfunded . 
  there was a proposal to officially make it the standardising authority in 2010 - said proposal would have also established a council of the italian language - but it was considered `` fascist '' and immediately discarded ( go figure ) . 
  it 's a shame that our language and culture are so neglected by politicians !, 
  yet i do n't think we 've ever had , or needed , a spelling reform since like the 1300s ? 
  i wish , i wish ... 
  we 've had them for decades !, 
  if anything , they have actually disappeared since the 1990s . 
  back then all you 'd see on local channels was soft porn , `` hot '' lines with naked chicks or seers who could read tarots and lotto numbers ... 
  not many unfortunately - this is not something we talk about ( kind of a taboo subject ) and my father was pretty young when they left anyway ; grandma died when i was fourteen so i never got to hear her side of the story . 
  afaik my ( paternal ) family had a home and a small activity in tripoli before gheddafi came to power in 1969 . 
  the revolutionaries confiscated foreign properties in july 1970 ; even the social security accounts were frozen . 
  libyan jews and italians were expelled by october 1970 so my family moved back to the mainland ... they had to leave with their clothes and whatever could fit in a suitcase !, 
  but they were lucky , they had relatives who could help them . 
  the friendship treaty with libya was supposed to enter into force by 2011 - one of its provisions being the unfreezing of said social security payments - but it 's unlikely we 'll ever get to see that money again . 
  such is life . 
  i learnt received pronunciation because the lectors at my university had a bunch of different english accents , so i pretty much had to choose one and stick with it !, 
  besides ... 
  i find the american varieties of the language to be phonetically awkward , they just do n't roll off my tongue as easily . 
  i also use british spelling . 
  plus - i 'm a european learning another european language so i think that it would make more sense for me to choose the european variety over the american one ; and foreign girls tend to * really * like my accent so yeah , that 's a bonus !, 
  none , but maltese and ( libyan ) arabic * do * have plenty of italian loanwords . 
  source : grandpa settled in tripoli , dad was born there and can speak the language ... 
  i 'd love to , but i 'm already having trouble trying to sell trevi fountain !, 
  but why do n't you sell it to one of those fabulously wealthy nigerian princes ? 
  luck ? 
  no , just a yahoo e-mail account . 
  not a nigerian prince but apparently i had a relative who was an engineer and , one day , he died in a car accident in kenya . 
  i was on my way to inherit a few millions but unfortunately they were stuck in some god-forsaken african bank !, 
  the guy in question flat-out told me to fork a thousand quid in order to `` grease the cogs of bureaucracy '' . 
  another time , would you believe it ? 
  i won the lottery in gambia .
