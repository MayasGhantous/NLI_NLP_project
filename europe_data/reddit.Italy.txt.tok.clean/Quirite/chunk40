  i also got propositioned by a u.s. army general ... 
  so do we , so do we !, 
  :-) glad we got our differences sorted out . 
  have a nice evening . 
  wheter it is debatable , this is not for us to establish . 
  that 's the deal we got handed , whether we like it or not , so if you still want to take revenge on the rest of us italians for whatever one of our grandparents might have done to one of yours , i encourage you to read the findings of the slovenian-italian cultural-historical commission ... and pray - better yet , make it so - that neither you or i or our families have to go through such horrors ever again . 
  never again . 
  & nbsp ; u/quirite over and out . 
  & nbsp ;  i mean you kinda did lose a war ... & nbsp ; yessir , damn right we did - and paid for it dearly , in case you did n't notice !, 
  ( just not the actual fascists but that 's another story . 
  you can thank the cold war for that ) . 
  & nbsp ;  [ ... ] also all villages around the city were majority slovene . 
  so italians might not be majoritly in the land . 
  & nbsp ; this is true , but then how would you handle such a situation in a way that does n't involve throwing innocent civilians down a sinkhole and telling the others to pack their shit if they do n't want to get the same treatment ? 
  how could anybody claim with a straight face to be any better than the fascists you so rightly despise ? 
  do two wrongs make a right ? 
  if so , when does it end ? 
  where do you draw the line ? 
  this line of logic is scary and , frankly , fucked up . 
  by those standards so was ceding capodistria , portorose , and a whole bunch of other towns to yugoslavia - but i hardly see anyone getting worked over it apart from my grandparents . 
  why are we having this discussion , again ? 
  i might also argue that trieste has been , for most of its history , a city with an italian majority * as well as * a very consistent slovene presence . 
  tell me - why should my family not live there and consider themselves italian ? 
  why should they , or the other inhabitants for that matter , become slovenian ? 
  just because you guys are butthurt ? 
  have we really learned nothing from history ? 
  i was referring to both periods . 
  besides ... 
  i do n't consider the period from 1919-47 an occupation but i can see why a croat , or a slovene , would regard it as such . 
  it is a very delicate topic to which i also happen to have a very personal , familiar connection . 
  istria was/is fairly significant to our history not just because of its venetian past but also because - to put it mildly - a friggin ' world war was fought for the sake of it . 
  a world war whose shenanigans led us to fascism , then another world conflict followed by more humanitarian tragedies and associated trauma * for all parties involved * ( gonars , arbe , the holocaust , the * foibe * , the istrian exodus , you name it ) which somehow leads us to the very kind of basket-case nationalist dick-waving hysteria you can see in the comments above . 
  and yes , it 's [ current year ] . 
  if that is n't significant then i do n't know what it is !, 
  seems like you 're not the only one ... 
  the sack ( s ) of rome ? 
  the gothic wars ? 
  the italian wars ? 
  the war of the mantuan succession ? 
  do n't put yourself down ... you 're second to none when it comes to it , i can assure you . 
  i 'd rather not . 
  unless you 're up for some genocide olympics ? 
  i hear it 's a popular pastime on both sides of the border ... 
  * istria ( and zara , which is in dalmatia ) . 
  no other words needed . 
  * corsica was never part of italy but the genoese , being the stingy bastards they are , sold it to the french . 
  * nice used to be italian until 1860 , then we gave it to the french in exchange for military assistance to unite the rest of the peninsula ; the ligurian inhabitants were promptly expelled and garibaldi was understandably not pleased . 
  then there 's briga and tenda and the sham referendum but now we 're talking about hamlets . 
  * i 'd also add savoy but it was so irrelevant no one 's ever given a fuck about it - not even the king . 
  i mean , he supported bourbon royalists during the revolutions of 1799 and had [ francesco caracciolo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francesco_caracciolo#trial_and_execution ) hung from the mast of one of his ships . 
  not exactly the nicest of guys , at least if you get to see him from our side of history . 
  `` attractive '' and `` strong '' traits give you 40 points when interacting with characters of the opposite sex . 
  however , if you 're `` brawny '' or `` gregarious '' you only get 5 ... 
  it 's tor bella monaca , a slice of medellin just past the ringroad . 
  he is actually fairly good with money ... his own , that is . 
  it 's the son who 's a terrible boss and is driving daddy 's empire to the ground . 
  thankfully , berlusconi did not have a nuclear arsenal at his disposal !, 
  or he would 've gotten the rest of us very , very tanned in no time . 
  well , i 've seen a serbian film once . 
  but only once . 
  `` political correctness '' is very much not an italian thing , i 'm afraid . 
  any hint of pc usually gets mercilessly mocked by italians who , as a rule of thumb , tend to make fun of everyone and anything . 
  and i really mean * anything * . 
  in all fairness we do have a couple of politicians ( boldrini , kyenge ) who tried to open a `` serious '' debate on political correctness , and look how it ended up . 
  boy what a cheeky bunch we are !, 
  and the mockery gets amped 100x whenever politicians are involved ... 
  nope . 
  i mean - here in rome we have something that might ( somewhat remotely ) classify as such but it 's a former housing estate full with druggies , hookers and thugs . 
  plus it 's so far out in the boonies not even romans have any reason to go there or stumble on it by accident . 
  there are unsavoury neghbourhoods in naples and palermo but that 's pretty much it . 
  besides , in every single one of those cases da mooslims are not involved so ... 
  i do n't think most people know anything past the first couple of verses . 
  it 's a long-ass slog of an anthem . 
  & nbsp ;  also does hearing your anthem give you some specific feelings ? 
  & nbsp ; yes , it 's called `` second-hand embarrassment '' . 
  please bring back the royal march , or at least something cooler than that damn circus tune , so that 1 ) no one has to sing it and 2 ) i do n't have to suffer through the sight of football players trying to maintain a dignified appearance while pretending not to have forgotten the lyrics on live tv . 
  buffon always tries so hard , it 's painful . 
  for the same reason you do n't remember about that guy who blew himself and a few other people up in baghdad ... 
  well ... huh ... no . 
  at least not to the same extent as the u.s. . our * carabinieri * do , in fact , road-checks with submachine guns - and they can be somewhat trigger-happy at times . 
  but the few times `` that '' happens it becomes national news . 
  in the past ( 1940s-1970s ) however we * did * have an issue with rampant [ banditism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salvatore_giuliano ) , [ kidnappings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sardinian_banditry ) , [ terrorism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/years_of_lead_ ( italy ) , mafia shootings , bombings and whatnot so this kind of things used to be a relatively common occurence of daily life . 
  thank god we live in such enlightened times . 
  shamelessly plagiarising my own answer from another thread , here 's a few reasons as to why 2016 may not be all shit : & nbsp ; 1 ) the new [ general data protection regulation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_data_protection_regulation ) was approved . 
  2 ) an eu court struck down the uk [ snooper 's charter ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/dec/21/eus-highest-court-delivers-blow-to-uk-snoopers-charter ) and [ other data retention programmes ] ( https://www.accessnow.org/victory-eu-court-rules-indiscriminate-data-retention-not-permissible/ ) . 
  3 ) that same court [ ruled ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20161027225130/http://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2016/10/eu-dynamic-static-ip-personal-data/ ) that dynamic ip addresses constitute personally identifiable information . 
  4 ) the eu passed a very important directive on net neutrality ; it 's not perfect , granted , but it 's good . 
  5 ) italy finally recognised civil unions , and it was fun to see the crypto-fascist scum in parliament getting triggered !, 
  6 ) matteo renzi got kicked out of office and the mayor of rome seems eager to follow his footsteps ( hopefully ) . 
  7 ) duuude we were , like , * this * close from actually legalising weed !, 
  better luck next time . 
  8 ) at least we 're a little step closer to viable nuclear fusion tech ?

  of all the italian writers - whom i largely despise - gabriele d'annunzio definitely resonates with me the most ; and he 's nowadays very much underrated , almost forgotten as an author . 
  never understood the appeal of writers like calvino , montale ... they seem to be famous just because our school curriculum and the intelligentsia wanted them to be . 
  hate dante and his bullshit with a passion . 
  i would also include giacomo casanova , even though he chose to write in french . 
  his memories are very good . 
  as far as foreign authors are concerned , i like some of joseph conrad 's works ( heart of darkness , an outpost of progress ) as well as stieg larsson ( the millennium trilogy ) .
