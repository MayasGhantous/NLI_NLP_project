  tried to like tolkien so badly but could n't get past the first door-stopper in the lotr saga . 
  jack london is very good as well ( anybody read the star-rover ? 
  they tried the same thing with germany in 1920 . 
  did n't work then , ca n't see it working now . 
  even if israel willingly gave up most of its military assets , you can be sure that its neighbours would be glad to act on such an occasion and try to reduce the whole place to ashes ; it 'd be like asking 1939 poland to please stop mobilising , nazis are no threat . 
  oh , wait a minute ... 
  were you in ostia ? 
  the water there is different and tastes like it came out of a clogged boiler . 
  which is bizarre , as our water definitely is n't chlorinated . 
  you meant it was heavy in calcium ? 
  i do n't know which kind of water you 've had but ours is one of the freshest and better tasting around . 
  that 's what helped spark fascism , so yes . 
  what about central italy ? 
  are you assuming we do n't exist ? 
  & nbsp ;  [ ... ] their land used to be part of austria before it was given to italy after italy switched sides in wwii . 
  & nbsp ; south tyrol had already become italian in 1919 . 
  and for your information it was the austrians who had already gleefully invalidated , multiple times , their own * defensive * treaty ... first by pushing for a pre-emptive strike on italy ( 1908 ) , then by annexing bosnia without consideration for its allies ( 1908 again ) and finally by declaring war on serbia ( 1914 ) . 
  we had no obligation to join them . 
  that place was n't even among the reasons we 'd gone to war in the first place ; at versailles our government realised that trentino , one of the provinces the entente promised in the pact of london , had in fact a very precarious strategic position . 
  therefore italy needed higher mountains in order to ~ ~ build a wall and make austria pay for it ~ ~ have a more defensible border . 
  and in case you really meant ww2 - it was the allies themselves who , having seen through the bullshit the newly-formed austrian government was putting up , refused to take action in that regard essentially allowing both parties to resolve the issue amicably . 
  if you close the faucet with a finger , the water shoots up from another hole . 
  [ like this ] ( https://formaggioheads.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_0368.jpg ) ;-), 
  well , we * do * drink [ from ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/fontana_del_facchino_a_via_lata.jpg ) [ those ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/fontana_della_botte.jpg/382px-fontana_della_botte.jpg ) actually . 
  by ` catholics ' i mean those christian parties which , despite the formal prohibition of the church - the various popes still being salty about the annexation of rome in 1870 - had nevertheless chosen to engage in italian politics . 
  apart from that , ours was mostly a catholic country with pockets of home-grown jewish and protestant ( like the waldensians ) communities scattered around . 
  basically the last step of the * risorgimento * after which most italians were finally united under the same flag and within the same kingdom , but a bloodbath nevertheless ; cadorna was a monster with a penchant for frontal assaults who used incredibly brutal methods ( decimation , barrier troops machine-gunning deserters ) to discipline his own and almost cost italy the war until somebody in parliament woke up , had him sacked and replaced with the much more humane - not to say competent - diaz in 1917 . 
  catholics and socialists opposed the war whereas many intellectuals pushed for intervention but they either regretted it or died in the trenches . 
  the world war in question later led to a bunch of other shenanigans such as the red biennium , the rise of fascism , etc. 
  almost every town has a plaque or memorial with the names of the fallen but apart from the vittoriano , rome does n't have a single monument ; rather , each [ ward ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-maurrx6clpa/vu07v7jboti/aaaaaaaacdi/avv8nk2coba/s1600/img_4327.jpg ) and [ district ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qxwiocdmxcq/vyge4pjomdi/aaaaaaaaczw/lzobii4wrcu/s1600/img_5864.jpg ) has [ its ] ( http://www.festadenoantri.it/images/luoghi/targhe/caduti_i_guerra/targa_caduti_i_guerra-01.jpg ) [ own ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-skgmznhociu/vx1tvfv5j2i/aaaaaaaacs4/_e25cs3_lqi/s1600/img_5095.jpg ) [ memorial ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ghyvgpa5jb4/vyophqc7sti/aaaaaaaaeis/zvnjeudwtzs77y7hhpravjmz4lhgl4bpqclcb/s1600/img_3632.jpg ) with the [ names ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-g8blsitme-y/vyrgqy03udi/aaaaaaaacx4/qay1la9xyoq/s1600/img_5812.jpg ) of the residents who lost their lives in the war . 
  there are also a few specific monuments lying around . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.gdf.gov.it/multimedia/foto/anno-2014/giugno/deposizione-di-una-corona-di-alloro-al-monumento-al-finanziere/06.jpg/image_large ) for example is dedicated to the fallen from the guardia di finanza ; [ this one ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q3runftnda4/vscw-bzsrzi/aaaaaaaadaw/h4lqpjuzroe/s1600/img_1504.jpg ) is dedicated to those from the army 's engineer corps ; [ this one ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fimsa7esrpw/vu__jnq4evi/aaaaaaaads0/4a6i0los_h45cx7sm07uz4hqhytq3cvsg/s1600/img_2539.jpg ) is dedicated to the workers of the city 's electrical company . 
  yeah , but feyenoord fans did n't like them ... 
  huh !, 
  come think of it we used to have a poorly-photocopied , a5 format school pamphlet with terrible drawings and unfunny jokes every ... sometimes a year . 
  probably . 
  but then again we did n't have a gym or toilet paper so that does n't surprise me in the least . 
  not quite . 
  actually , st was n't among the lands promised with the pact of london ; it was only added in 1919 when the italian high command realised that newly-acquired trentino was hardly defensible , and needed the new border to be pushed as further north as possible not least because a line of fortifications - the [ alpine wall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alpine_wall ) , whose bunkers deserve a visit btw - was then being planned . 
  it was pretty much an afterthought in that regard . 
  wrong world war ( i 'm referring to the one which got a shiny new battlefield game ) . 
  this is more how you spot non-italians , though . 
  invicta backpacks . 
  uh-oh , i stand corrected !, 
  we surely would have been better off if he stuck with his teaching career anyway . 
  but sure , the years of lead were pretty shitty too ( not least because of all those cia shenanigans ) . 
  & nbsp ; there 's just too many parts of our history worth being angry over !, 
  especially anything from 1494-1870 and 1922-47 . 
  & nbsp ; * like every time a pope called foreign kings to invade and stomp all over the peninsula because he felt threatened or tried his damnedest best , by way of getting even more foreigners involved , to prevent italians from uniting ( lookin ' at you , pius ix ! ) . 
  * whenever we had the misfortune of being ~ ~ squeezed ~ ~ ruled by the spaniards ( thanks for helping turn the southern third of the peninsula into the economic powerhouse it is today ; and let 's not forget about those advanced social mores you imported ) , french ( when they were n't looting they were too busy spreading venereal diseases ) and austrians ( whose love for secret police , censorship , gratuitous repression , executions , discrimination and absurd tax rates endeared them to the locals ) . 
  * what about that traitor , wannabe-frenchman napoleon b ** u ** onaparte ( i , not iii - even though the other guy was n't blameless ) who invaded italy , turned against the revolutionaries who supported him , dismembered venice plc-style , gave northern italy away to the austrians and then looted the hell out of us so that the louvre could be well-stocked on masterpieces ? 
  * what about the bald idiot from ~ ~ emilia ~ ~ romagna who marched on rome and proceeded to send our country down the shitter at the cost of a few hundred thousand lives ? 
  this goes without mentioning : 1 ) the death of italian democracy ; 2 ) the creation of that meddling theocracy smack-bang in the middle of rome , thus reversing a century of risorgimento ; 3 ) the racial laws , the persecution of ` suspected ' homosexuals and other minorities ; 5 ) our participation to the holocaust ; 6 ) the regime 's [ war ] crimes ; 7 ) the nazi/allied occupation and civil war ; 8 ) the partition of italy 's borders with the humanitarian drama that followed ; 9 ) the fact that the same fascist cadres who brought italy to ruin in the first place were allowed to stay in power and retire peacefully as if they had rendered our country a great service . 
  no one was brought to trial . 
  collaborators even got pardoned in 1948 . 
  & nbsp ; tl ; dr - italians lost the war and paid for it ; the fascists pretty much did n't . 
  probably the roman one ; most of those who do n't hail from the capital seem to have an issue with it . 
  does n't help that the dialect itself can come across as un-belly-evably crass and rude ... 
  ca n't be worse than the italian ones !, 
  to sum it up with an old joke - `` the crisis is so bad , shopkeepers started treating customers properly !, 
  the old anthem i was referring to , the * canzone del piave * , has been the provisional anthem of the republic for a few months in 1946 before the current one was chosen . 
  it does n't have absolutely anything do with either fascism , fascists or the regime . 
  yeah , the royal march would indeed make more sense if we were still a monarchy but as far as the association with fascism goes it 's pretty null - the party 's anthem was in fact * giovinezza * and we 've had the march since 1831 . 
  not to mention the fact that we 've fought three wars of independence and two world wars since it was adopted so it 's fairly significant !, 
  by that logic germany 's current anthem , which predates the nazis by a long stretch , should also be changed because it was used by them . 
  why ? 
  last time i checked , we lost a world war . 
  then our post-war governments realised there was a shitload of money to be had so we officially ` lent ' those bases to the americans who , afaik , pay their rent and generally bring some monies into the local economy . 
  but as it turned out , citizens do n't quite like having foreign bases anywhere near their homes and some soldiers tend to be the kind of troublemakers with a less-than-stellar attitude . 
  also , [ shit like this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cavalese_cable_car_disaster_%281998%29 ) is another good reason for not wanting u.s. troops on our soil . 
  this goes without mentioning the blatant oil-grabbing in iraq , afghanistan , etc. 
  brb going to france to steal some women, 
  & nbsp ; there are too many things to list !, 
  wish i could share them all . 
  here 's a few personal favourites of mine : & nbsp ; * until 1889 the death penalty was enforced throughout italy save for tuscany , which had abolished it in 1783 . 
  * it was then scrapped in 1890 , reintroduced in 1931 , partly re-scrapped in 1948 and abolished for good in 1999 . 
  * the country got its very own version of hong kong with blackjack and hookers at [ tientsin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_concession_of_tientsin ) ( 1900-1946 ) . 
  * the last stand of the duke of aosta and his 6000-men-strong italian/somalian/eritrean garrison at the amba alagi , in which they managed to hold off some 41000 commonwealth troops during a two-month siege in april/may 1941 . 
  * amedeo guillet led a few thousand italian colonists [ in a guerrilla war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_guerrilla_war_in_ethiopia ) against the british and ethiopians . 
  * did you know ? 
  italy 's fascist-era civil ( 1942 ) and penal ( 1931 ) codes are still in force ; what 's even more surprising , so are most royal decrees despite the country having been a republic for some 70 years now . 
  those born in 1985 were the last cohort to be drafted afaik . 
  draft has been * suspended * in 2005 but still , most ( 30 + ) adults had to go through it . 
  being in the military does n't carry much prestige though it is certainly a cushy state job !, 
  do you guys worship the ladies at the dmv ? 
  soldiers are little more than civil servants in uniform here . 
  plus everyone and their dog has been conscripted at some point in their lives so ... no . 
  should 've specified `` here in italy '' ... in the 1990s serious proposals were made to replace it . 
  oh you 'd be surprised by how many people here would disagree . 
  i do n't have a preference in styles but i happen to really like russia 's !, 
  they 're just [ better ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th-z6le3bha ) at propaganda . 
  as far as the current italian anthem is concerned , well ... it 's a pathetic tune better suited for a circus . 
  either we get the [ old one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynqck2bozlm ) back , stick with the [ royal march ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxjfeodl8le ) or choose [ something ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooyau0nurg0 ) [ else ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1jkhnocxgo ) . 
  anything is better than that unsingable piece of crap with operatic pretenses . 
  bonus points for the royal march not having words , thus sparing us the sight of footballers faking their way through the anthem . 
  & nbsp ;  a weird tradition that russians have is putting photos of the deceased on gravestones . 
  & nbsp ; huh ... to be honest that 's not weird at all , at least in my country . 
  99 % of gravestones have the deceased 's picture ( [ example ] ( https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcs-tzneamy2ndrnntvxyeeq1kru4idywbd5vgn-femi_tl1ri9ffq ) ) , as well as a little space to put fresh flowers . 
  personally , i 'd be more inclined to put the blame on the italian government . 
  but it 's not like we were going to take those urns home anyway ...
