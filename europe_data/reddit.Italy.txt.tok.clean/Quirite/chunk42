  & nbsp ;  what 's the attitude to cremation in your country ? 
  what are graveyards like ? 
  & nbsp ; cremation is not very widespread ; my uncle was , though , and had his ashes scattered at the local `` garden of memories '' which is basically a plot of land next to the facility . 
  you can have the urn buried there but ca n't take it home because of health regulations . 
  most tombs resemble literal [ condos ] ( http://roma.repubblica.it/images/2011/01/25/201122999-96ec5085-c6da-4599-8d48-0017e8b86159.jpg ) [ for the dead ] ( http://www.municipioroma.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/prima_porta_albero_2-620x310.jpg ) - unless you 're rich or nobility that is , then you get to be buried in your family 's private ( and often [ tacky ] ( http://www.repstatic.it/content/localirep/img/rep-roma/2015/08/15/131654084-494a051a-581e-45ac-b5f8-2d9c3d4c871c.jpg ) ) mausoleum away from the rest of them commoners . 
  if you 're really loaded you can buy a fancy plot in the vip cemeteries . 
  the ` ordinary ' ones in big cities are literal towns of the dead ; you have to get in by car and drive to the tomb . 
  indeed , whenever i visit i have to stop at the office and request [ a map ] ( https://www.bing.com/th?id=oip.m893a5ac0679ff412b1e87a8f39e1c4a3o0 ) of the cemetery with the grave 's location ... btw due to space constraints , when you die you get buried in a smallish [ plot ] ( https://s1.qwant.com/thumbr/265x200/3/8/ba766bef04bbd20ffd68f20376421f/b_1_q_0_p_0.jpg?u=http%3a%2f%2fimages-3662.kxcdn.com%2ffidelitynews%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f03%2fcimitero-prima-porta-disservizi.jpg&amp;q=0&amp;b=1&amp;p=0&amp;a=0&amp;b_id=oip.m5ab19da90a0d794e3958b94f30f47ebfo0 ) of actual land for 10 years ; then you get dug up and moved to one of those condos for another 25 ; then your bones get `` reduced '' ( crushed ) and put in a small recess near the ossarium ; then after a few more years ( do n't know how many ) whatever 's left of them gets dumped in with all the others . 
  it ai n't a pretty sight . 
  & nbsp ;  are any foods or drinks specifically associated with funerals ? 
  how often do you visit graves of relatives ? 
  & nbsp ; not that i know of . 
  it is however customary to visit one 's dead relatives every 2nd of november . 
  well , technically he 's the president of the council of ministers . 
  politicians are evil incarnate and come in four flavours : the thieving crypto-fascist , the revolving christian democrat who knew about gladio , the guilt-tripped socialist , that other dude who may have worked for the kgb . 
  ballot papers are the size of a newspaper . 
  [ i 'm not kidding ] ( https://searx.me:3000/?mortyurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.prefettura.it%2fpadova%2fcontenuti%2f17939.htm&amp;mortyhash=f16ed2fd8c78f94e0de771abcf5393849b32833d21642969f3fb0060847ed85d ) ( pics do n't do them justice though ) . 
  & nbsp ;  2013 update : we now offer anti-vaxxing , chemtrail-chasin ' conspiratard cloud-cuckoolanders in the guise of m5s ` activists ' . 
  & nbsp ; when you vote , you have to unfurl the whole thing on a 4 x 4 cm shelf and cross one among the 99864 same-ish looking symbols ( be careful not to confuse the south tyrolean union of mall workers with the national retiree 's party against nuclear power or one of the 167 micro-incarnations of the fascist/communist party of old ! ) . 
  this said , which symbol you mark does n't really matter because half of the people on that list will have probably switched parties at least a couple of times before the first half of the term ; failing that the mps in question may create yet another microparty which is 99 % like the one they just left , except for the blackjack and hookers . 
  during national elections it is customary for the incumbent party to give blatant hand-outs to the populace ... as is tradition . 
  a terrible war conducted by terrible people with terrible means , but one of national liberation ; in a sense , it was ww1 that ` truly ' made italy and italians because it was the first time in centuries so many people from all over the peninsula fought together for a common cause - to retake the territories lost during the partitions of 1797 , and reunite all the italians that had been under foreign domination under the same flag and the same kingdom . 
  some textbooks even conflate it with the other wars of independence . 
  uh , no , never heard of them . 
  briga marittima and tenda were annexed after a sham referendum in 1947 , at that . 
  the french wanted the coast ( including ventimiglia ) plus the valle d'aosta ... 
  yeah , but perhaps coroner is n't the right translation . 
  do you have to deal with a state-appointed half-lawyer/half-doctor whenever you need to have your driving licence renewed , want to become a gun owner or a taxi driver , or need to have your disability certified ... ? 
  and do you have to shell out big-time dosh whenever you see one ? 
  over here we have the so-called * parcheggiatori * , who have become like a plague in rome . 
  mostly shady guys from the south who place themselves near hospitals , cinemas , other trafficked places in the city centre , etc. 
  and pretend to ` help ' you find a spot ; you got to park in the one they tell you and give them a ` tip ' or else your car 's gon na be scratched . 
  quite illegal but traffic cops often turn a blind eye ... swines the lot of 'em i 'm telling you !, 
  we had those in rome as well , but they have n't been around since the 1980s . 
  is that pronunced tee-shach ? 
  not really - these women were often hired by the wealthy families of a particular deceased to follow the funeral procession all the way through town to the church ; for them it was more like a show of wealth and power than anything . 
  still creepy of course !, 
  i 've read somewhere that this was the continuation of a 2000-years-old ancient greek practice ... 
  notaries , coroners - * medici legali * - and , until the 1950s in parts of the country , matchmakers ... who used to arrange marriages . 
  in the deep south ( sicily and environs ) there also used to be the * prefiche * , women paid to mourn other people at their funeral !, 
  btw my grandmother got engaged thanks to a matchmaker , her mum hired one and got her married to a perfect stranger ... 
  the difference between the accent of the roman middle/lower classes and that of the upper ones is very straightforward ; the latter only speak standard italian and refuse to ever make use of the dialect as it is considered extremely crass , coarse and rude . 
  but then again - unlike milan or turin , rome historically never had a proper burgeoisie apart from the few noble families with roots in the city so 1 ) you wo n't find many of them in the first place and 2 ) most of those belonging to the lower/middle/middle-upper classes will sport , to varying degrees , that particular roman inflection ... much to the dismay of the rest of the country or so it seems . 
  the whole thing about an ` inner city accent ' does n't apply to rome simply because its now-historical centre represented much of the city until the 1920s ; many of its inhabitants were evicted and relocated to the suburbs during the demolitions of 1870-1936 and then , starting in the 1980s , many of those who stayed behind sold their properties and left - with the result that the place 's been held hostage by tourists , hotels , b&b s , shitty eateries , overpriced pubs , souvenir shops , ` artisanal ' hipster bullshit , politicians and a few rich wankers for decades now ; i would n't even consider it part of the city . 
  the accent is very even throughout town ( the only exception of sorts used to be trastevere but it has long lost any peculiarity whatsoever - at least since 1870 ! ) . 
  even the half million people who relocated here from the marches and abruzzi in the 1960s/70s adopted the local accent , so . 
  ah but of course , we did it so that you could get a taste of your own medicine !, 
  :-p ( actually they just needed big-ass mountains , it was an afterthought ) . 
  of course , and i 'm not blaming you guys - i was just giving some background to the other user 's ` evil empire ' comment . 
  but yeah what we know about austria comes from history textbooks , mostly , and they do n't exactly paint it in a positive light ... 
  afaik many italians would like to disagree ( the guy above you with no flair is one of us methinks ) . 
  it was n't called a `` prison of peoples '' for nothing , especially after venice and milan were dismembered plc-style ; for us , spending - roughly - a couple of centuries under the austrian jackboot was n't that nice of an experience . 
  the regime was fairly brutal here . 
  & nbsp ;  and of course italy later switched sides . 
  & nbsp ; i see this repeated often but actually , italy just signed an armistice ; it never joined the allies . 
  anyway the answer to your question is `` nope , not at all '' ( especially after the treaty ) . 
  well , it 's not easy because we get such stupid views drilled into our heads as early as high school . 
  there 's either the shitheads from fn/casapound or the maoist dumbasses from the communist youth distributing leaflets and soliciting for donations outside school property , then there 's the quasi-fascist student union as opposed to the quasi-communist student union ; both hate each other even though they only differ in the way or place they roll their joints at during recess . 
  all of this is incredibly pointless and retarded . 
  in this country everyone and their dog 's either a fascist or a communist , regardless of their actual political leanings . 
  and the same stale , 70-year-old recriminations get repeated every 25th of april ( `` why are we even celebrating a defeat ? 
  '' , `` we are n't ... eat shit and die , fascist ! '', 
  `` no you do , partisans were a bunch of fucking traitors ! '', 
  `` better a traitor than a nazi !, 
  '' , etc ) . 
  the fun part is that usually , none of the people who engage in that kind of shit-talking were around during ww2 . 
  plus cigarettes and all kinds of medications are 20 % off !, 
  ( no condoms though ) . 
  `` if you wo n't visit russia , russia will visit you '' . 
  yes . 
  ah but they certainly have an interest in visiting other countries ... ukraine is especially popular with tourists . 
  & nbsp ;  [ ... ] do schools in your country do anything to come together and celebrate your community ? 
  is it common to use school songs , colors , or mascots in your country ? 
  [ ... ] are there things like school bands , school newspapers , and school magazines ? 
  & nbsp ; no , no , no , no , no , no , no and no . 
  to all . 
  many schools here do n't even have proper gyms or toilet paper , let alone sports teams and mascots !, 
  even though we did have something akin to a newspaper , but it was an a4 photocopy of a hand-written pamphlet and it was published irregularly . 
  all you do during high school is to get in , attend classes , recess ( smoke break ) , then go home at lunchtime ... ... you can do all the other things on your own free time and money . 
  schools in italy do n't have the kind of identity yours do . 
  i have no strong feelings one way or the other . 
  not our wars , but thanks for having dragged us along i guess ? 
  and for what , exactly ? 
  you 'll understand if i have little to no interest about who 's killing who ... 
  that 's because you do n't have glorious telepass system . 
  on new years ' eve , he can make some 60 million italians change channel at once . 
  we can do without a few hundred ambulance drivers with literary ambitions , thank you very much . 
  and we shall meet again at vittorio veneto to give you aussies another good spanking !, 
  [ * i 'm sorry , dave , i 'm afraid i ca n't do that . 
  * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj8cagm6je ) ( as an evil roman imperialist myself i take great delight in talking shit about them norn ` ers ) . 
  ok then ... thanks a bunch !, 
  btw north ? 
  independence ? 
  it 's not 1996 anymore mate - the northern league discovered the joys of southern votes a long , long time ago when they shifted the hate towards immigrants . 
  they 're too smart and like ( taxpayer ) money too much to leave . 
  besides , padania as an entity is as real as teletubbieland . 
  ah , sorry , it 's difficult to get the nuances through the interwebz . 
  and i could ask you that very same thing ... 1943-1949 much ? 
  look , mine was a joke and i have no intention of taking part to the genocide olympics . 
  peace .
