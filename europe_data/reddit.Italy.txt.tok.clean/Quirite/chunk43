  gee what 's with you balkanites and cleansing ? 
  it * is * a commieblock , complete with druggies and prostitutes . 
  same in italy - we all fear the * corrente * over here . 
  but yes , my grandmother too warned me to never sit on the floor at home because the cold may travel all the way up to my back and then i could get an ache , possibly catching pneumonia or death in the process . 
  oh oh oh , you wish !, 
  1919 best year of my life . 
  ( and even if you did you 'd be getting italy 's own retirement home , which is not that nice ) . 
  have n't you heard ? 
  wind is the number one cause behind all kinds of aches and ailments , especially those localised in the neck area ; you should never , ever leave home without having thoroughly dried your hair first otherwise you might catch a cold and die . 
  do n't say we did n't warn you . 
  then you 'd better start making decent beer , or they ai n't gon na let you join the club anytime soon !, 
  london , new years ' eve 2013 . 
  think of polar temperatures coupled with the kind of wind that would put trieste to shame . 
  what do we see ? 
  scantily-clad - actually almost naked - girls everywhere !, 
  to my italian brain , which is naturally hard-wired to fear even the most innocuous gusts of wind , this is unacceptable . 
  that , and the people puking their guts out on the pavement at 6 pm . 
  i wo n't actually be mentioning the separate faucets for hot and cold water because at this point it 's like beating the proverbial dead horse ( but i 'm definitely going to mention the exotic , and admittedly most curious , habit of carpeting your bathroom of all places ) . 
  toll booths . 
  ever heard of them ? 
  i mean , even croatia has those ... just let that sink in for a minute . 
  sure , as long as you have good dentists and cheap petrol . 
  but seriously , fuck dars !, 
  historically speaking , the alps have always been italy 's best ( and perhaps only ) friend . 
  legend has it that the architect who designed it died shortly after seeing the finished thing . 
  i do n't know much to dispute it , but it sounds plausible !, 
  i understand the political angle but did n't it become a rather iconic building ? 
  they very much do , and rome is no exception . 
  you know , proles generally do n't live in the quaint city centres tourists see ... 
  the entirety of rome 's outer suburbs should be nuked from outer space imho . 
  as well as all the shitty housing that sprang up between the 1950s and the 1980s ( not least because half of it was built illegally , almost overnight , with subpar materials and is an eyesore ) . 
  but wait , there 's more ... europe 's longest housing project : [ the snake !, 
  ] ( http://www.arvaliastoria.it/public/010286.jpg ), 
  of course , we need government approval even to take a shit . 
  this is kinda reasonable though . 
  if you have an undiagnosed heart defect , join a gym and suddenly die after perving at the hot girls during yoga class then it 's the owner 's ass on the line . 
  there 's legal trouble to be had . 
  absolutely haram !, 
  general practitioners are not `` public officials '' the same way police , judges or ... coroners are . 
  and while gps do visits for free , they still charge you for things like those certificates you need to join a gym or swimming pool ( prices are at their discretion : it is perfectly possible for one doctor to charge 60 $ , while another may ask for 80 ) . 
  exams coroners give you are considered beyond the so-called `` essential levels of assistance '' so you have to pay for them yourself as they 're not covered by the ssn ; prices are high despite being set by the government . 
  1 ) yes , 2 ) nope , even though they work with and for the ssn . 
  appointments are about 15-20 quid each ( prices vary ) but keep in mind that you 'll be going there relatively frequently and for relatively minor things as well . 
  then there are all the medical/drug/psychological tests they will tell you to do at your own expense ; in my case ( taxi driver ) the arsehole in question prescribed * every single one of those in the list * even though i had already done many of them while in the military , not even a year before . 
  i ended up paying about 600 $ , and good thing i pestered him or he 'd have forgotten my case even though the hospitals i had done the exams in had sent their results weeks before so all he had to do was to have a look at them , scribble a few lines on a piece of paper and put a stamp on it . 
  but `` no paper no registration '' - the local chamber of commerce was n't having any of that . 
  the kicker ? 
  i have to do this every three years . 
  that 'd be the forensic specialist - * medico legale * - tasked with investigating suspicious hospital deaths . 
  in italy , however , you also need to visit this ~ ~ villain 's lair ~ ~ person 's office whenever you need a certificate stating things like your degree of disability , professional competence ( for jobs like security guard or cab driver ) , eligibility to be a gun owner and whatnot . 
  this is also the person will be evaluating you should you ever happen to get your driving licence suspended or revoked , possibly because of a dui ... ... and every time you 'll set foot in that dingy , smelly little office , you 'll be safe with the knowledge that you 're about to be treated like the absolute worst criminal piece of scum on earth and have paid good money for such privilege . 
  what a time to be alive . 
  & nbsp ; edit : btw happy cakeday !, 
  same here !, 
  ok , i see where you 're coming from . 
  but let 's be honest : the whole thing about lower incomes is a joke , as the government has set the bar so low that one would almost have to be on the brink of starvation in order to qualify for any kind of discount . 
  this goes without mentioning the waiting lists , and good luck trying to claim your unemployment or doing anything useful with it . 
  prices in conventioned clinics , on the other hand , are still obscene and borderline unaffordable . 
  let 's not forget about what kind of butchers populate the asl , last time i checked they did n't even have anaesthetic !, 
  no biggie , right ? 
  after all who does n't want to have their cavities done without the thrilling prospect of at least some pain ... 
  the ssn does an admirable job overall but the italian dentistry sector is simply undefendable ; in fact , it 's utter shite and i 'd rather make the trek to croatia all over again than give a single penny to such profiteering fat-cats . 
  teeth are not a luxury !, 
  that shitty rip-off of `` titanic '' . 
  you know , the one with the rapping dog and all ... 
  i 'd say that the italian system works , and fairly well at that . 
  now if only it included dental care ... too bad the dentists here are a friggin ' cartel !, 
  they would give colombian narcos a run for their money . 
  it is cheaper to cross the border at trieste , stay in a hotel , enjoy the beaches of istria , have your teeth fixed in a local clinic and get back home via train than having a single capsule fitted here . 
  they even speak italian and accept euros , so what more could you possibly want ? 
  god forbid you ever need to speak with a coroner ... bunch of arseholes the lot of 'em . 
  they think they 're doctors but they 're not , they think they 're lawyers but they 're not and yet they want to be paid like one , they have an inflated ego the size of a drug lord 's fuck-off mansion ( complete with coke plantation ) and are incredibly rude to boot . 
  expect to shell big-time dosh whenever you see one . 
  i think they 're the most hated professional category in italy after traffic cops , notaries , taxi drivers , civil servants and politicians !, 
  ** spanish ** ... you know those ads in which the speaker has to warn the public of contraindications of a given drug in a ridiculously short time ? 
  or that sound videocassettes used to make when you rewound them ? 
  that 's spanish . 
  the ** french ** sound like they 're doing their best to talk while trying to hold their mouths as closed as possible . 
  ** english ** has no middle ground ; you 're either milord or a chav , sometimes a cowboy . 
  sometimes all of them . 
  ** portuguese ** is what you would sound like when you 're all bunged up and still attempt to speak italian . 
  ** welsh ** is what dead cthulhu would probably ` speak ' if it ever wanted to interact with us puny humans . 
  ** dutch ** sounds like a german trying to imitate a scotsman while coughing all the way through . 
  ** modern greek ** has a singy-songy feel to it and random , unexpected italian words abound . 
  ** polish ** is surprisingly smooth and sexy on the ears - a true slavic pantydropper of sorts !, 
  ** albanian ** is what an hypothetical bastard child of french and turkish would sound like . 
  sardinians sound like latin-speaking robots who talk in reverse , like master yoda . 
  venetian tends to have that slurred feel to it , you can almost smell the grappa . 
  tuscans have a most hilarious lisp and sometimes they talk real funny . 
  calabrians sound like they 're having an hiccough all the time . 
  the milanese , well ... they just sound effeminate !, 
  & nbsp ; finally : & nbsp ; roman , my dialect , is what harambe would sound like had it been given the faculty of speech . 
  still quite fond of it though !, 
  & nbsp ;  they do n't even speak the letters that are right there !, 
  & nbsp ; wait until you have to read fre - sorry . 
  heil no !, 
  not quite , i for one ca n't understand a word of spoken spanish !, 
  & nbsp ;  how does your country view ... the army ? 
  & nbsp ; the military has no particular prestige here ( everyone and their father has been drafted at some point ) so its members tend to be seen as little more than civil servants with an uniform on . 
  still , it 's a state job and once you 're in ... you 've made it for life .
