  yep . 
  many young people - at least in the centre/south - want to join the armed forces not least because for many of us this may be the only chance of ever getting a decent job with a decent pay , timely paycheques , an actual contract and benefits . 
  hell , if you manage to join you can even hope to retire one day !, 
  at this point they do n't even need recruiters or campaigns of any kind so many are the people who want to get in ; problem is , the positions available are very few and assigned through open competitions ( in 2014 there were some 3000 candidates for 167 vacancies , and i 'm talking about ncos so nothing special really ) . 
  i find this a tad absurd . 
  & nbsp ;  how does your country view ... conscription ? 
  & nbsp ; we 've had conscription from 1846 to 2005 - it 's been suspended ever since - so not many of those who 've had the chance to ` go under the arms ' miss it . 
  but i like to think that it provided , at the very least , an occasion for many 18-year-olds to actually do something useful with their lives which , due to the hostile socio-economical climate , has now become sort of impossible . 
  this said the general consensus among the ` older ' generations is that conscription made you a grown man with balls and a spine . 
  if you managed to survive all the hazing going on there that is ( dangerous pranks , juke-boxing , brawls , etc. ) . 
  & nbsp ;  how does your country view ... military spending ? 
  & nbsp ; depends on who you ask . 
  politicians of all parties have been desperate to cut anything but their fat salaries so you can imagine just how beneficial such a policy may been for our armed forces ( but there 's plenty of waste , especially among the top brass ) . 
  ordinary people do n't care that much about it . 
  & nbsp ;  h\u010di & nbsp ; bless you !, 
  i spent around 10 , 20 quid for each photocopy i bought from the uni 's printing shop ; the professors themselves made these . 
  you can also ask them to send you the relevant pdfs/slides , most will comply . 
  naturally there were a couple of courses which required actual books but you can easily find second-hand editions around , and even the '' required '' textbooks never costed more than 30 $ . 
  actual monarchist here !, 
  here 's a few corrections : 1 ) emanuele filiberto is not - and has never been - the heir to the italian throne , seeing how he was born well after his father was disinherited by the late king himself in 1970 . 
  amedeo di savoia-aosta is the current heir , the u.m.i. 
  recognises him as such . 
  2 ) the guy in question is not a prince ... or even part of the royal family for that matter . 
  neither is his father . 
  3 ) we have n't had a monarchist party since the '70s ; the u.m.i. 
  is simply an organisation ( albeit one with royal assent ) . 
  roman here . 
  currently living with grandpas in a council house ... 
  i happened to lose my previous job and could n't find another ever since , parents got divorced so i had to move there . 
  at the moment i 'm an apprentice electrician under my father but i get no money out of it . 
  it 's not that bad because my grandparents truly need a hand with chores and i 'm glad to help , it 's the least i can do !, 
  the flat in question ( 80 m \u00b2 ) is located on the third floor of a condo from the 1920s with no lift and external piping ; this means you get warm water in summer and ice-cold in winter . 
  nice . 
  stairs can be a bit dangerous because the marble used in most steps is still that from mussolini 's times and it 's slippery/sloped/chipped in more than a few places . 
  there 's a kitchen with a giant-ass hood right above the stove - a relic from the times in which these used to run on coal - plus two bedrooms , a bathroom and a living room . 
  the layout of the house is kinda weird due to it being basically a looong corridor and all the rooms have high ceilings for some reason . 
  rent is 300 $ / month , minus the bills but including heating and other expenses . 
  & nbsp ; edit : in case you were wondering , council estates are fairly normal places in italy ... not necessarily a hotbed of crime and corruption . 
  in fact , ours happens to be fairly nice ; it 's mostly families with kids and there 's even a garden where they can play . 
  edit/2 : yes , they still have a rotary phone and the wallpaper is utter shite from the 1970s , when diarrhoea was all the rage . 
  many , if not most people , hardly give a fuck nowadays but one of my grandfathers had his property seized then had to flee tripoli with his family in 1970 ... when the local italian and jewish communities were forcibly expelled by gheddafi 's new regime that is . 
  he was glad to hear that the old bastard had been shot by the rebels even though the libyan government of the time was about to finally unfreeze these people 's social security accounts ( with relative benefits ) and pay them indemnities after 30 or so years . 
  we 'll see if he lives long enough to see his hard-earned money back or if anything good at all comes out of such a clusterfuck . 
  but , dude , she looks like she belongs to friggin ' jurassic park or something . 
  even then zara was the only dalmatian city to be part of italy . 
  and it had an italian-speaking majority ... not exactly what i 'd call a colony !, 
  the transition itself was fairly gradual , it was the prices that doubled almost overnight !, 
  i agree , but then how can they guilt-trip the government into milking the rest of us for more money ? 
  ( oops ... 
  i really meant `` autonomy '' . 
  you mean student unions ? 
  pretty sure we do n't have anything even remotely comparable to fraternities over here . 
  hell , we do n't even have dormitories or proper campuses at that ... 
  anyway - these exist within the student council which , at least theoretically , is the body representative of all the students ( duh ! ), 
  but what you actually get is a system with a myriad of one-person parties ranging the gamut from `` nazi-eco-stalinists '' to `` marilize legajuana '' to `` altar boys , inc. '' nobody really cares about . 
  except for the latter ; they 're said to be well-connected with certain professors and the many hospitals that are run by the church . 
  boring , useless but at the same time kind of harsh ; basically a left-over from the 1940s . 
  i may be slightly biased , though ... not least because i flunked a couple of years !, 
  the honour goes to [ napoleone di buonaparte ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/napoleon ) ... we 're talking about the kind of guy who first invades a foreign place with the support of local revolutionaries , then promptly betrays them , then proceeds to loot countless artifacts from all over the peninsula so as to ship them to paris and * then * sells venice with its istrian/dalmatian possessions to the austrians just because he could therefore ushering some 200 years of oppression and brutality throughout north-eastern italy which , fyi , ended in an even more tragic bloodbath ( of the kind you had to study in high school ) . 
  second pick would be [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pietro_badoglio ) - when he was n't too busy sabotaging a couple of war efforts or committing war crimes on the side he managed to get hated on by royalists , fascists , partisans and common people ... all at the same time !, 
  i speak the roman dialect ... or whatever 's left of it ... which , in case you do n't know , is considered quite coarse and tends to be looked down upon by pretty much everybody else . 
  teachers have always given me shit because of my accent , which is why around the tender age of 8 i started talking like one of those anchormen you see on the telly . 
  later in life i just stopped caring and reverted to my native accent - much to the the joy of my own family !, 
  & nbsp ;  [ ... ] how does it differ from the standard language ? 
  & nbsp ; it used to be * quite * different but now that dialect has an awful lot in common with standard italian ; but still , pronunciation is not exactly the same and neither is the vocabulary . 
  the prosody too is different . 
  si sounds fairly uppity , fast-paced and ... singy-songy whereas the roman variety flows more slowly , is kind of monotone and tends to have that heavy/slightly slurred feel to it ; * doo giiive ya n'aideea , ding ov an idaaalian whoo 's ander anesdesyyy * . 
  romans also chew and garble words , whose endings get decapitated ( too lazy to pronounce all the syllables ! ) . 
  btw we also have a tendency to pepper our speech with profanities , which is what it makes it so damn colourful ... 
  really . 
  also a good place if you 're into postage stamps ... 
  somehow i pictured the guy squatting * and * wearing an adidas tracksuit while doing the trash-typing !, 
  [ * i 'm sorry dave , i 'm afraid i ca n't do that . 
  * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj8cagm6je ), 
  fair enough , but * that * napoleon sold much of italy to the austrians and then he became emperor anyhoo ... ... let 's just say that napoleon 3.0 x was a vast , * vast * improvement over his predecessor . 
  & nbsp ; edit : we may be willing to forgive you ( but only if you allow us to clone aliz\u00e9e ; you know , for science ) . 
  thieves ? 
  shall we mention all the priceless art you guys have stolen ? 
  i wo n't even talk about the * gioconda * because it 's the only one painting you 've actually bothered to buy . 
  how nice of them !, 
  but we 'd already given them most of northern italy to trample on , and for some 200 years at that . 
  it 's only fair . 
  ** fluent in ** : english , french and modern greek . 
  ** can understand ** : veeery limited german and croatian ( it 's a long story ! ) . 
  ** currently studying ** ... polish , because it 's just * so * damn smooth . 
  & nbsp ; as far as italian schools are concerned , we attempt to learn whatever mangled version of english our professors are trying to teach us . 
  in middle school you could - at least theoretically - choose between latin , french or spanish . 
  i say * theoretically * because the first year of ms we had textbooks but not a teacher ; the second we got neither ; during the last one our 14-y-o selves had a true bombshell for substitute ... you can see were this is going . 
  it 'd gotten so bad i resorted to just speak italian while adding an - s at the end of every word !, 
  ( still passed the final middle school exam with flying colours though ) . 
  & nbsp ; edit : south-tyroleans also get to learn german at school . 
  edit/2 : do n't know about the * valdostani * but i 'm pretty sure that they , like leprechauns , do n't exist . 
  ** vatican city ** ... 
  i can just leave home , temporarily immigrate and buy medications ( but not condoms ) 22 % off . 
  ** san marino ** ... used to be that tax-haven next door ; now it 's just weeaboo central . 
  cheap katanas , anyone ? 
  ** france ** ... the best thing about it is that there 's a rather conveniently-placed mountain range separating us . 
  ** switzerland ** ... order , precision , efficiency , peace , and everybody actually minds its own business ; this goes without mentioning the landscape , high wages , quality of life and strong privacy laws . 
  what 's not to like then ? 
  ** austria ** ... the country that gave us mozart , his balls and sachertoerte .
