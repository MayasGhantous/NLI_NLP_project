  yeah , i really meant * sub * - machine guns ( such as the pm-12 ) . 
  my bad . 
   my impression of rome was that people seemed to be open and spontanious towards one another this is because the city centre is almost devoid of romans altogether and you have probably interacted with a few southerners , who seem to populate the local restaurants ... but try have a look at the rest of the city instead - we do n't even know the names of our neighbours and only have to ~ ~ fight them ~ ~ attempt explaining common sense at them during the ( thankfully ) annual condo meetings . 
  and everybody 's so paranoid , no one trusts the other ... granted , it was n't always like that and switzerland is quite different from italy in that aspect . 
  in the case of rome , most have already sold out their homes for peanuts and quite a few places are indeed getting a facelift courtesy of the big corporations . 
  problem is , this is not a desirable outcome as the city 's historical centre is slowly turning into a theme park of sorts - something even faker than victor ponta 's degree , that is . 
  or do n't get into a taxi at all . 
  i happen to be a taxi driver and , well ... speed is money , to a degree . 
  you want to keep that taximeter clicking . 
  you can thank a long , long slew of amazingly-incompetent mayors for that . 
  rent the scaffolding , deal with the paperwork , make sure to pay all the ridiculous local taxes ; for many this is too much - always assuming that the tenants/proprietors manage to find an agreement . 
  oh , the joys of living in a condo !, 
  plus ... if you live in the city 's historical centre , the local * soprintendenza * ( the entity in charge of the local archaeological sites/historical palaces/whatnot ) is the one who gets to decide what colours you 're allowed to paint your building in . 
   driving in naples , italy is absolutely crazy . 
  nothing in europe is even close . 
  traffic lights are purely for decoration . 
  to be fair , we 're talking about * naples * here . 
  naples is the exception to everything , it 's ... in a league of its own . 
  berlusconi was neither the founder nor the one in charge of the northern league - umberto bossi was . 
  and no , rome is located in * central * italy ( a place many southerners/northerners/foreigners alike tend to forget about ) and has committed the mortal sin of having been chosen as the country 's capital ... much to the milanese 's chagrin , it seems !, 
  according to the * leghisti * , rome is the source of everything evil and as such it gets just a tad less flak than the south does - but we got used to it since time immemorial . 
  oh , and we 're all lazy and corrupt ( tbh our government really is ) . 
  i swear i have seen a few of these gun-toting * carabinieri * on the metro and elsewhere ? 
  not that machine-guns are an acceptable way of dealing with pick-pockets ... at least not yet !, 
  naaah - the * leghisti * used to say far worse things , and we were n't even mad . 
  it 's sort of cute actually . 
   turned out to be a brazilian guy who felt that ~ ~ italian ~ ~ roman people were really cold and always avoided eye-contact . 
  ftfy but , hey , a few neapolitan friends of mine told me the exact same things ... 
   do you feel personally insulted when the gauls defeat the romans again and again ? 
  no , because i know it was some gaul 's wet dream all along . 
  hey , i am roman myself and this is the impression i have of my own city ; but i would actually be inclined to believe that this is not the case in the south - people are far more sociable there . 
  do n't know about the country 's north ... 
  well - the ariete was indeed given two different `` protective kits '' during the iraq campaign , but none of these actually included any kind of reactive armour . 
  and as far as i could understand , the scudo system ( our very own variant ) appears to be still at testing stage ... personally i would n't be surprised if further research had already been halted because of the chronic lack of funds ; hell , we ca n't even seem to get new engines !, 
  let alone futuristic armour . 
  right ? 
  rome is probably the european capital of gratuitous rudeness and anti-sociality - we are renowned for our grumpiness , our hospitality can be compared to that on tatooine , we like to jump at each other 's throats for nothing , plus `` avoid thy neighbour '' seems to be the most sacred commandment in town . 
  and there 's the rampant paranoia ... apart from elders , i would n't recommend trying to start a conversation at the bus stop . 
  you probably would n't enjoy the fact that they carry actual machine-guns over here . 
  i was pleasantly surprised by the londoners ' friendliness and amiable manners . 
  and no , i am not being sarcastic !, 
  yeah , but they also said we 'd have jet-packs and hoveboards by 2015 ... 
   the armour is a steel and composite blend , similar to the british challenger 2 and the american m1 abrams . 
  mmmh , i do n't think so - as far as i know , the ariete lacks any kind of reactive armour ... 
  i 'm afraid the c1 is hopelessly outdated ; the project could have looked good in 1985 but due to its unnecessarily long ( and slow ) gestation or the concurrent techological advances , by 2015 it seems utterly inadequate ( powertrain , armour , suspensions , you name it ) . 
  imho we should have stuck with the leopards , and they would 've costed us less . 
  we do n't even have the money to upgrade it !, 
  the tank 's probably going to share the same fate as the sidam . 
  edit : the ariete 's not that bad actually , but it 's not the best either . 
  just `` meh '' . 
  reverse triathlon !, 
  otoh , i really was n't expecting such high levels of anti-semitism ... 
  does this surprise anybody , really ? 
  he was ; mussolini was not . 
  the only thing is , berlusconi has n't actually been in power for 20 years ; he served four , non-consecutive terms - two of which lasted less than a year while the other two ( 2001 , 2008 ) three . 
  and he may have not even served some of them , had the left-wing parties abstained from traditional pastimes such as infighting and self-destruction . 
  having to vote the lesser evil for lack of credible alternatives is something you do n't want to experience . 
  `` sorry , but a country that has democratically voted hitler into power should n't be trusted '' . 
  you see ? 
  it goes both ways ... 
  he was a decent mayor though . 
  if that bridge 's so shitty then why do n't they replace it ? 
  you 're right , let 's hope they are n't into fluggaenkoecchicebolsen ... 
  deal !, 
  ca n't believe they 're having trouble procreating with all the gorgeous chicks out there . 
  as a european citizen , i feel i have the moral duty to do my part and ~ ~ thrust ~ ~ push for closer integration ... 
  here , have a couple of $ and a bag of crisps . 
  i 'm pretty sure that showering every * other * day is fine ... doing it too often is n't good for your skin . 
  t-that 's bullshit ... 
  i 'm rather fine . 
  actually , i 'm * damn * fine !, 
  you hear that , eu ?!, 
  i 'm damn fine !, 
  yeah , i agree that the budget is totally inadequate !, 
  but the fun thing is that our government is still trying to entice young people into enlisting nevertheless despite the ( too ) many , many cuts they themselves have imposed ... 
  actually , uh , most eritreans * do * like us and quite a fair bit at that - even the libyans are n't that resentful . 
  i 'd worry more about the russkies ... 
   an amendment by italy 's left-leaning , populist 5 star movement ( m5s ) oooh , that explains everything ... do n't worry - it 's just a bunch of paranoid , yet somewhat-harmless conspiratards who fail to understand both economics * and * politics getting all worked up over something of no relevance whatsoever . 
  next time you 'll hear about them they will be too busy getting indignant about `` those kid-diddling reptilians '' , finding a 100 % organic cure for cancer with the help of the daily mail 's brightest minds or exposing the illuminati 's latest plans for world domination . 
  i do n't think molise would be a happy place , even if if it existed . 
  if it can be of any consolation , the kingdom of italy was actually ~ ~ among ~ ~ the very first european country to de-criminalise homosexual relationships in 1889 . 
  but we have far more pressing issues to think about right now ... ... besides , this is not a competition !, 
  can confirm , people here barely know about it . 
  hell , i actually learned about the festival * from reddit !, 
  the water at ostia is so clear that sometimes you can even see your own feet !, 
  in fiumicino ( the town , not the airport ) instead it 's got such powerful healing properties you 're guaranteed to grow an extra limb just by looking at it . 
  sounds like the plot for another installment of * speed * . 
  * ooops !, 
  i did it again ... *, 
  boo-hoo , everybody has nice old emblems and all we got is that pseudo-marxist thingy . 
  what pathetic excuse of a roman would i be if i passed on such a wonderful opportunity to make fun of neapolitans ? 
  that 's literally parochialism 101 . 
  bet those 21 fat people all live in naples ... ^ ^ / s, 
  well , * that * flag with the eagle was actually [ the one ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tkv99xkzoqa/uw1gvhxkksi/aaaaaaaauf8/t6e0f1bkwco/s1600/16117_230684880396975_2047694329_n.jpg ) used in mussolini 's social republic ... and it 's considered a fascist symbol over here , so i do n't think anybody would be willing to ever adopt it . 
  the flag i linked above instead is that of the kingdom , in use from 1848/61 to 1946 . 
  got to say that ours looked way better with that [ coat of arms ] ( http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/regno_d%27italia_%281861-1946%29#/media/file:flag_of_italy_%281861-1946%29.svg ) on . 
  now it 's just kind of ... * bland * . 
  our public schools may not be among the best but they can still offer a good formation all-around ; most private institutes otoh are a total joke indeed , a phrase that in this context means `` some kind of parking lot for the often dim-witted , twice-flunked kiddos of rich wankers '' . 
  but i suspect this is the case pretty much anywwhere . 
  the problem is that our public schools are perpetually underfunded and often lack any kind of amenity whatsoever ( sometimes even gyms : we played volleyball in the parking lot before the parents came to pick us up ) .
