  i agree that we should show solidarity . 
  i 'm just saying that 's not how it works . 
  seeing the russian flag obviously wo n't cause riots in the streets but it can send the message `` russia is our ally '' since this stuff has been done mostly for our allies . 
  a message europe does n't wamt to send . 
  that sucks but that 's it . 
  people use the tram to get in their car . 
  that sent me in a new dimension, 
  not in diplomacy though, 
  the bottle of wine xd, 
  [ we are replacing that class though ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lss,_logistic_support_ship ), 
  we do have the fleet to support them in combat . 
  but i agree , we are behind the uk and this index will show us behind the uk when they complete their carriers anyway . 
  also this index does not take into account nuclear capabilities , the uk has his own nukes . 
  we rely on nato for our deterrence . 
  i 'll give you an answer here . 
  i think that ca n't work cause it 's weird for the intersection and harder to do . 
  why not accept half of the italian flag near the uk and let the european dream happen ? 
  it 's better for everyone . 
  see my plan below . 
  man , this means well ` have a permanent pixel-war south of the eu and you wo n't be able to expand north . 
  i want to avoid that . 
  think about it . 
  you 'll mantain another spot ( in the area where italy and the uk are ) and you 'll have a more stable situation at the european intersection . 
  italy was a founder of the eu too . 
  and it looks like spain ca n't form a flag without an agreement . 
  if tayllerand had that attitude , france would have been destroyed during the talks for the congress of vienna . 
  we all need to be flexible to achieve the best possible outcome . 
  think about it . 
  it 's way better than the current situation . 
  for everyone . 
  why ? 
  do you really prefer this unstable situation ? 
  how ? 
  you are still above the eu flag ( and you can work to expand there ) . 
  and most importantly you `` ll get a second spot in the map . 
  it 's actually pretty good . 
   your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries . 
  chill dude , chill, 
  in order to do that we need an agreement : \u2606 the germans help to do the spanish flag \u2606 the blue of the french flag gets replaced by the green of the italian flag \u2606 in exchange for that , italy gives to france half of the flag next to the uk, 
  that of italy next to the uk . 
  what if we paint blue half of it and make this plan happen too ? 
  let 's start negotiations on r/italy and r/france or here . 
  then there wo n't be a european flag in the middle of all of them . 
  what if itay and france share that place next to the uk , cutting it in half ? 
  let 's do this !, 
  so your plan is just to buy time . 
  there are already two years for the negotation in which the eu can prepare to replace or delete the british contribution to the budget . 
  so i do n't see why the eu should let you have three years of single market without freedom of movement if you go out of it anyway . 
  and there is also the possibility that eu rejects parallel trade talks . 
  if a transictional period ( like the one the parliament endorsed ) happens , it wo n't be single market without freedom of movement imho . 
  i don `` t get what happens after 2022 according to your plan . 
  then you 'll have to pay and mantain freedom of movement . 
  i mean there 's no alterative . 
  do you think the eu is that stupid to let you to stop pay after 2022 and remain in the single market without freedom of movement ? 
  that will be crazy . 
  and europe invented america , do n't forget that :d, 
  he is president mattarella himself . 
  ouch , my fault : i thought it was [ gioia del tauro ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gioia_tauro ), 
  eu nations should develop a similar intelligence pact the five eyes have . 
  it 's funny ( or maybe not ) cause he was going in [ calabria ] ( http://i.imgur.com/suqne8u.png ) for a cerimony . 
  # ** a baby demon is growing inside him . 
  ** or maybe it 's a hearing aid . 
  well i 'm sure he 's talking about a * political * problem . 
   third largest member , paid into the system more than they got out of it . 
  same for italy . 
  actually in some years the uk paid less than italy despite having a bigger population and less than france despite having a bigger economy . 
  [ they are trying ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_civil_code ) they even made a common frame of reference . 
  but the project was watered-down , if i 'm not wrong . 
  that of japan is more than 200 % and it 's sustainable mostly for the same factors of italy . 
  it has been sustainable for decades , it will likely be sustainable for the next decades . 
  of course an italian debt crisis will bring down the eu , but my point is that our problem is how the growth relates to the debt , not the debt itself . 
  let 's put it this way : it is a problem cause italy has to find a way to grow . 
  italy used to grow increasing the debt , now it has to find alternatives cause that ca n't work anymore . 
  ( the alternatives are probably keeping the structural reforms and making a serious spending review to increase public and private investments ), 
   but still , italy is such a big systemic risk for eu not really . 
  the debt is more like a risk for italy itself , in the sense that italy has to find a way to grow which is alterantive to increase the debt ( which is what italy did from the 80s to mid 90s ) but the italian debt is sustainable for a variety of japan-like reasons ( high private wealth and savings , primary surplus , debt mostly in italians ' hands , low interest rates and other factors ) . 
  for italy it 's because there was the opportunity to develop a gas hub in southern europe . 
  we lost that opportunity accepting european solidarity . 
  on the other hand , germany has no problems with nord stream ii even if it 's a time of sanctions . 
  from that moment italy has started to be much more skeptical of sanctions . 
  not saying italy is right and germany is wrong , but there are conflicting interests, 
  still trying to figure out why south stream closed while north stream is fine . 
  i remember a huge confrontation between italy and germany at a european council . 
  [ renzi accused merkel of a political double-standard over the involvement of german companies in the construction of a gas pipeline with russia , nord stream , at a time when the eu is about to approve the extension of sanctions against moscow , according to a diplomat ... during the summit , leaders discussed the merits of the controversial project after several others raised concerns ... he also accused germany of profiting from the euro crisis , pointing to moves by the german airport operator fraport to buy airports in greece after merkel urged greek prime minister alexis tsipras to privatize them ... `` you can not say that you are giving your blood to europe , '' renzi told merkel after the german chancellor spoke of berlin 's push for europe ... ] ( https://www.google.it/amp/www.politico.eu/article/matteo-renzi-picks-fight-with-angela-merkel-brussels-summit-eurozone-pipeline/amp/ ), 
  well in a way that 's not illegimate of course . 
  anyway i 'm not taking one side or the other . 
  if i was may i 'd have the referendum as soon as possible . 
  the more time pass the more you 'll lose the support of scottish people . 
  furthermore if you win twice in two-three years then you pretty much killed the affaire . 
  if you let them wait until the early 2020s , scotland will likely leave , especially if brexit has a bad impact on the economy . 
  it is becoming more meaningful only in recent years due to the debate around wealth inequalities . 
  also it was harder to measure it in the past . 
  it 's basically the total sum of private wealth in a nation . 
  it 's not that useful for public budget then , this is why the gdp is more used . 
  [ source for exports is the cia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_exports ) [ source for the gdp are the imf figures ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) [ source for the wealth is global databook of creditsuisse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_wealth ), 
  i know all of that . 
   spain is barely a middle power dude , it 's not like south africa is a superpower ... and yet it 's a member . 
  anyway i 'm italian so it 's not my fight . 
   nato ? 
  the group is full of nato members , ** all with a much bigger role than spain ** how are germany and italy ** much ** more influential than spain in nato ?
