  we have to cut somwhere . 
  `` low '' home ownership rate, 
  cause there 's a lot of wealth in the uk so wealth per adult is very high and this map is about that . 
  [ median wealth is actually lower for each country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult ), 
  i think that 's it . 
  if you look at the [ report ] ( http://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/index.cfm?fileid=ad6f2b43-b17b-345e-e20a1a254a3e24a5 ) , the financial wealth in switzerland is particularly high ( it 's around page 95 ) . 
  the article says that data for ukraine , belarus and moldova are poor . 
  u/lupaine is likely right . 
  the map includes all monetary assets , both financial and non-financial wealth . 
  including savings . 
  also , this map includes both financial and non-financial assests . 
  just type on google * global wealth report 2016 * . 
  all financial and non-financial wealth is taken into account , including savings , i guess . 
  they also have the * median wealth * which is obviously lower for every nation , maybe that 's where to look at . 
  wealth is defined as the total value of monetary assets and properties at a set point in time . 
  both financial and non-financial wealth . 
  it 's possible cause the home ownership rate is lower in germany or the netherlands while it 's higher in italy or france . 
  at least that 's what i think . 
  [ global wealth databook for 2016 is similar ] ( https://www.credit-suisse.com/us/en/about-us/research/research-institute/news-and-videos/articles/news-and-expertise/2016/11/en/the-global-wealth-report-2016.html ) i 've seen other reports and they are similar too . 
  well they are not low . 
  but it 's not the gdp nor the income . 
  it 's private wealth , so countries with more properties and an higher home ownership rate are * favoured * by this statistic . 
  a country 's national wealth is usually bigger than its gdp , so they are not the same . 
  [ look ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_wealth ) . 
  wealth is also more unevenly distributed . 
  more like : france : hey , wan na kill gaddafi ? 
  italy : are you crazy ? 
  france : have nothing to do and want ~ ~ oil ~ ~ peace britain : yeah i 'm in america : you go , i 'm gon na lead from behind italy : ok , i 'll be in too and give you the bases ^ butleavemetheoil ** gaddafi killed ** germany : the fuck you did , now who is in power ? 
  italy : something like 300 tribes . 
  now we have to support serraj france : yeah let 's support ~ ~ haftar ~ ~ serraj usa : do n't give a shit , just going to bomb here and there . 
  just how i like it . 
  yeah , i was talking about [ lexical similarity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lexical_similarity ), 
  but italian is closer to french . 
  both if you look at the family tree and also if you look at the vocabulary . 
  this is debatable . 
  when there was no operation ( 2014-2015 ) the numbers were also rising , there were just more deaths, 
  so they are against scenario 3 , but what scenario do they support ? 
  i 've seen the press conference . 
  she was vague , but hollande and gentiloni talked about [ enhanched cooperation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enhanced_cooperation#european_defence_initiative ) . 
  in that case you do n't really need support of the v4 for greater integration , but who wants to join can join . 
  i guess that 's what they have in mind . 
  i kinda agree with you . 
  but that 's how the world works unfortunately . 
  if i am not mistaken , [ obama won primaries in 2012 too ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_party_presidential_candidates,_2012 ) . 
  you just do n't know cause he had the advantage to be in office so he did n't have to campaign and no one knew who the other guys were . 
  it 's not something related to spain . 
  and spain is n't usually invited because the other countries veto spain 's partecipation in such meetings . 
  so it 's not because `` it 's not rich enough '' or other weird stuff . 
  it 's the same reason why spain is a only a guest at the g20 or the g7 . 
  it 's more about size . 
  germany sometimes tries to decide things alone , sometimes they share within the franco-german motor and sometimes with france and italy . 
  at that point italy does not want another southern european country in decision-making groups and germany does n't want three mediterranean countries balancing its weight during talks . 
  france usually agrees because spain is not a founding member . 
  this time is different cause rajoy is somehow stable compared to merkel , hollande and gentiloni . 
  also , there is n't renzi around who was the fiercest opponent of rajoy ( the two guys never had a bilateral meeting in three years while renzi actually met various times pedro sanchez calling him `` the next spanish pm '' ) . 
  they 're going to support the third option of the white paper proposed by the commission ( a multi-speed europe ) , the new military hq , a budget for the eurozone , migration ( there 's also a big africa conference expected to take place in germany ) , hard brexit talks . 
  some of this stuff is probably going to be mentioned in the declaration for the 60 years of the eu in the next european council . 
  i do n't know if there is going to be real change though . 
  there 's no representative of the ec , so that 's not a good sign . 
  you mean you thought there were less people ? 
  or you did you thiink the boot was smaller ? ... 
  monaco , san marino , malta and vatican too . 
  ( * micro-states yeah * ) edit malta is included, 
  yeah . 
  a padania without lombardy and veneto ... tell that to the northern league, 
  gdp ppp is used to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries . 
  so i 'd say it 's maybe better when using `` per capita '' data . 
  that said , gdp ( pppp ) does not reflect the economic power , the value of the output in international trade etc. 
  so nominal gdp is generally more used when talking about `` economic size '' , `` economic power '' etc. 
  and we were talking about that . 
  i just looked it up imf 2016 estimates : 8 italy 1,852,500 millions 9 brazil 1,769,600 millions 10 canada 1,532,340 millions 11 south korea 1,404,380 millions 12 russia 1,267,750 millions 13 australia 1,256,640 millions 14 spain 1,252,16 millions, 
  our gdp is actually bigger , it 's the eighth largest in the world . 
  that of russia is the size of spain . 
  it looks like a laurel wreath , and that was a roman thing too . 
  meh , there 's bologna but not milan ... 
  we had a meaningful impact in world war i to the point that we were recognized as one of the five permanent members in the league of nations ' secutiry council . 
  so i guess we would 've had a meaningful impact even if we were on the side of the central empires . 
  but at the same time he wants to leave the eurozone and reduce the debt . 
  i told you : grillo is everyhing to everyone . 
  most of our debt is owned by italians and our wealth per capita is pretty good . 
  our deficit is also not that bad and interest rates are not that bad . 
  so we are not going to default , just like japan which is now over 200 % and still does n't default . 
  our real problem is that , because of this debt , we ca n't really make investments or detax labour so we have a weak growth since a couple of decades . 
  it 's weird no one thought of `` exitaly '', 
  ca n't say i disagree with that . 
  there 's also the motto `` only paris is worthy of rome , only rome is worthy of paris '' . 
   with pantheon , colosseum , st. peter \u00b4 s basilica , or trevi fountain , the capital of italy has more attractions than most eu capitals combined . 
  take that , paris !, 
  i agree . 
  i mean , tajani is probably the least evil in berlusconi 's party but there 's no way he will be better than schulz . 
  are you sure ? 
  i 'd say the average redditor of r/europe is wolfgang sch\u00e4uble, 
  who ? 
  it 's an intelligence body . 
  its job is to give informations ( mainly classified reports ) to the eu institution and member states . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_intelligence_and_situation_centre the eu also has a military staff , a situation room and a satellite centre . 
  here 's how the organisation works when it comes to foreign policy and security : http://eeas.europa.eu/background/docs/organisation_en.pdf, 
  are you sure ? 
  i thought sylvie goulard was the one behind the cancellation of the deal . 
  the whole alde group had a meeting at a certain point and he ( ver . ),
