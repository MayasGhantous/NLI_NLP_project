  italy wants to see the creation of an eu prosecutor general and perhaps even a european version of the fbi nice idea . 
   de maiziere said that germany 's constitution would not allow the formation of a european fbi and said that better monitoring and surveillance and data sharing represented the only practical way forward . 
  end of the dream . 
  last time i saw the king of spain in video ( 2015 , maybe ) he looked much younger . 
  that 's the whole point, 
  but steinmeier is the head of state , so the map is right . 
  it 's steinmeier, 
  no , merkel is your head of government . 
  and your president is more than cerimonial , he has reserved powers ( dissolving the parliament , veto laws , naming the chancellor , ) . 
  the chancellor , on the other hand , is the `` de facto '' leader of the country because he/she has a majority in the parliament . 
  [ example ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/pomo_della_discordia ), 
  in italian you can also say `` pomo '' . 
  it 's more poetic but it 's correct . 
  jupiter optimus maximum smoking a joint . 
  the french constitutional system is very effective in that regard . 
  voting for the parliament a bit after electing the president and after the president has named his government leads the voters to give the majority to the president 's party . 
  spending does n't mean more effective either . 
  what matters today is power projection and deterrence . 
  ok but corbyn may need to form a government with the lib dems and with the snp . 
  in that case he will have to deliver a soft brexit and give scotland a referendum in 2020 or before the 2 years of negotiations end . 
  romans had their first month named to mars , the god of war . 
  then they added january and february . 
  this is also why you have october , november , december as the 10th , 11th and 12th month . 
  originally they were the 8th , 9th and 10th month , just like the names suggest . 
  why ? 
  that hdi meas that they are basically at the same level , in fact both are in the same group when it comes to standard of living ( very-high ) . 
  unemployement is lower in slovenia , which obviously means it 's easier to find a job but it 's also more likely that if you find a job in spain you 'll have a better life , cause per capita figures are still better for spain when it comes to gdp per capita , or even better when it comes to wealth per adult . 
  my point is that we ca n't look at a single number to give a picture of an economy . 
  but anyway i agree that slovenia has a pretty advanced economy now . 
  and i knew slovenia had good statistics . 
  i 'd argue that you do n't even measure an economy 's sophistication by only looking at the gdp per capita . 
  there is the human development index , there is the wealth per adult , there is the unemployement rate . 
  we ca n't just look at one statistic . 
   i believe this image was taken before berlusconi had it painted in yellow : now it looks like [ this ] ( http://www.dagospia.com/img/foto/12-2013/matteo-renzi-nell-288794.jpg ) .

  russia has the permission of syria ... as much as i dislike putin their presence is absolutely legitimate . 
  you ca n't use force in another country unless : a ) the un or the sovereign government of that country approves it b ) you or your allies have been attacked without these conditions you commit a violation of international law . 
  looks german, 
  sounds like the enigma of amigara fault, 
  my sister had to sleep with sergej lavrov :(, 
  11.78 popes if you consider that there 's also benedict xvi, 
  yes . 
  gentiloni ( and shinzo abe ) wanted to have russia back in the group but this plan was probably stopped by may . 
  italy has always had good relations with russia even during the cold war . 
  i 'd say it 's for diplomatic reasons ( realpolitik ) , so italy acts as a bridge between the us and russia when it comes to european affaires . 
  you can see this in italy 's positions regarding the sanctions or syria . 
  i agree with you on that , they probably took into account the fact that he bombed that base in syria and therefore thought he is n't that `` warm '' to russia . 
  maybe , i mean she is so strong and so stable ... she can do it . 
  she is the only leader pushing for more sanctions at the moment . 
  you are right , but shinzo abe is trying to improve the relationship with russia : he is probably the first japanese leader to put a lot of effort in it . 
  so this is why he is considered warm to russia just like trump is in the middle even though there are us sanctions in place against putin . 
  this is more about the leaders , i guess . 
   is it real ? 
  < ---------------------  save the planet i laughed so hard, 
  that could have a bad impact on the economy . 
  i mean , if you eliminate tax allowances in order to put money in the pockets of people that do not pay taxes at all , you are : 1 ) creating a hole in the budget in the long-term 2 ) basically promoting unemployement . 
  i mean , if you really want to change the situation for people without a job , it 's better to spend money in public investments rather than create a new small subsidy for the umpteenth time ... 
   but the church is just so autonomous ... people down the ladder say `` oh , i do n't agree '' or `` oh , nice pope '' and that 's it . 
  diplomatically , the holy see speaks for the whole church . 
  and the holy see is basically the pope plus the roman curia . 
  only one case in germany , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  hollande is the son of soros , the man in black is his secret twin ( just in case to replace him ) . 
  every leader has a jewish clone somewhere . 
  the man is basically a clone of hollande ( with the beard ), 
  pianoforte ( piano = soft ; forte = loud ) vaffanculo ( five words actually , you can also say `` vai a fare in culo '' ) affresco , chiaroscuro , terracotta and a lot more , i guess . 
  you need a permanent naval blockade in front of libya to do that . 
  i remember this plan was agreed in april 2015 , so i think the correct term is `` failed '' not `` failing '' . 
  really ? 
  do you mean the tornados ? 
  i think the gop is waiting for a big scandal to replace him with pence , a more traditional conservative ( he may be worst than trump btw , sounds like a religious a fundamentalist basically ) . 
  that said , pence would absolutely lose the 2020 elections ( and the gop knows it ) , trump can win . 
  maybe not on that level ( breitbart is more like `` la verit\u00e0 '' , a right-wing ) . 
  `` il fatto '' is serious at times but often makes huge mistakes by looking for scandals even where obviously there are n't . 
  so this is why i say it 's better to wait . 
  this is what `` il fatto quotidiano '' jut said , i 'll wait informations from more serious journals . 
  in fact , berlusconi 's girl is like 50 years younger than him ... 
  fascists gon na fasci, 
   leonardo sacco is a friend of the italian foreign affairs minister i do n't really like alfano , but this particular guy simply has a photo with him during some sort of public meeting . 
  he also has a photo with the pope . 
  anyway let 's wait for more informations . 
  well , if we want further integration we need eurobonds . 
  well , i mean you can say that you are a [ european argentinian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argentines_of_european_descent ), 
  well , at least he is coherent / s, 
  [ 0:40 berlusconi mimics to shoot a russian journalist who asked a question to putin , putin approves ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfv0x1e4zzs ), 
  france deserved waaay more points . 
  i hope the guy does n't do that for his lover, 
  r/firstworldppoblems r/icallbullshit, 
  no it 's not just the banking system . 
  it also includes non-financial wealth and homes etc. 
  the point is that they lack these data for some countries ( russia , belarus , ukraine . . ), 
  yeah , so that 's what it is, 
  i know , but it 's the most used indicator to represent the income ( not median of course ) . 
  probably a mix of poor data for these countries , low value of properties in eastern europe and private debt taken into account ( while obviously pensions and incomes are not taken into account ) . 
  tbh the median wealth of ukraine ( or russia or belarus etc. ), 
  must be a combination of poor data , low value of properties in eastern europe and large private debt . 
  it would make no sense that the average ukranian owns 133 $ of stuff . 
  the first you said . 
  gdp per capita is the one closer to represent the income .
