  this is more like the sum of properties and savings . 
  to be a federation you need to be a single sovereign entity . 
  member states in the eu share their sovereignity but they are still sovereign . 
  so we are more like in between a confederation and a federation . 
  yes , that does n't change the fact that there is an agreement between the us and germany that basically says '' if you are attacked we wo n't prevent you from using them '' . 
  now of course the point is that it 's up to the us to decide if they want be on the side of a uk that attacks or on the side of the defensive germany of this scenario . 
  nato nuclear sharing . 
  see how it works . 
  he won the elections three times though, 
   the only candidate states are balkan states . 
  yes but you have ukraine that wants to join and countries that would join in a second if they become candidates ( norway , switzerland ), 
  wo n't work . 
  when there was no search and rescue operation ( in between operation mare nostrum and operation sophia ) they were coming anyway . 
  there were just more deaths . 
  ( examples : this case of 2013 that happened even before operations were put in place ; or april 2015 with more than 1000 deaths in less than a month with no operation ongoing ), 
  it is different . 
  look at the euro . 
  everyone is supposed to join it except for the fact that there are some de jure ( or de facto ) opt-outs . 
  so some countries do not join it . 
  on the other hand the multi-speed europe ( not two-speed apparently ) proposed right after brexit by the inner six and opposed by the v4 would be based on `` opt-in '' , thanks to enhanched cooperations . 
  so basically we go from : \u2606 all 27 agree on something and accept who has an opt-out to : \u2606 some states ( at least 9 ) agree on an enhanced cooperation and then it 's up to the other members to decided if they want to join in the future . 
  enhanced cooperations have been rarely used , the euro is not an enhanced cooperation for example : itis the currency of the eu , except for opt-outs . 
  what has changed after brexit is that now it looks that we will see the use the instrument of enanced cooperation , maybe in the field of defense . 
  i 'd be ok with brussels tbh . 
  an alternative is rome . 
  maybe in the eur area . 
  we have no idea . 
  btw it 's not even needed to have 2/3s for the electoral law ( that is required for constitutional amendments ) . 
   articolo 1 and si for the election to come ? 
  articolo 1 wants to form an alliance with pd and is supporting the government . 
  si does n't . 
  but there is a possibility . 
  it depends on what kind of electoral law the parliament makes . 
  together si and articolo 1 poll around 6-8 % , i guess . 
  this is some detailed shit , i wonder how the guardian got access to documents of the italian intelligence ? 
  elections are in 2018 but we may have early elections as soon as the parliament approves a new electoral law ( but it will take time , i doubt they will make it ) . 
  renzi stepped down as prime minister and then as secretary of the party . 
  now there are primaries in the democratic party to choose the secretary of pd and renzi is likely to win ( according to the polls ) . 
   what does renzi want ( was n't the reform his prime idea ? ), 
  probably he wants to prove that he can win the elections . 
  renzi came to power without passing through elections ( like may in the uk ) . 
  so a lot of people claimed he was illigititmate ( that it 's false , but he got called un-elected etc. ) . 
  this is why he designed the reform as a sort of `` confirm my government or i will resign '' . 
  it was a stupid move , as all opposition parties , and even a minority of his party , allied against him and he got defeated . 
  now he wants to prove that he can win the elections , but the five star movement is higher in the polls ( because a small part of the pd left and formed another party polling around 4 % ) and the current electoral law is basically a pure proportional system , so no one will really win and we 'll end up with some sort of grand coalition . 
  melenchon policies can not be implemented ? 
  what bet ? 
  what 's jamaica ? 
  * listen from 0:17 to 0.20 * i 'm gon na say no , he doesn `` t have the x-factor . 
  so what is this ? 
  so le pen is much stronger with an electoral college vote . 
  i believe it 's because the electoral college gives more power to smaller regions/states . 
  it 's often the case that poorer regions are also the less populated , because people from those areas migrate to the richer parts of the country . 
  and one thing that we know is that poorer citizens ( and therefore smaller regions ) tend to vote for populist parties cause they feel they are not supported by the establishment ( while populists promise them unrealistic simple solutions ) . 
  if you really want to defeat populism you need to reduce unjust inequalities . 
  i do n't think he said that, 
  no , i mean operation atalanta and stuff like thatm, 
  i agree , but there are dozens of eu missions around the world , and few eu countries can act as `` framework nations '' in such operations . 
  the uk has often been the framework nation , giving most equipment , troops , logistic contribution etc. 
  both the uk and the eu will lose economically . 
  claiming otherwise is stupid . 
  i think the uk will lose more in the long term . 
  and both ** may ** have a political gain . 
  the eu can win politically given that the uk has always prevented further integration . 
  but , even there , not only the uk but also germany etc. 
  have stopped various integration attempts when contrary to their interests . 
  and britain will have a political gain if it will be able to become a bridge between the us and the eu . 
  so this is a complicated shit , it 's not like there is one side winning and one side losing . 
  if you lose a p5 and g7/g20 nation you ca n't gain influence . 
  and if you lose access to a single market of half a billion `` rich '' people , you wo n't increase your trade . 
   to take properly care of those people [ this is exactly how you take care of those people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herd_immunity ), 
  i think you are confusing belgium and bulgaria . 
  and there is n't such a big difference between 9 and 10 millions . 
  true , john oliver joked about it in the video about the french elections, 
  that 's what she probably wants . 
  i know . 
  my point is that prime ministers call for general elections in countries with a monarch . 
  in italy , that ca n't happen , it would be considered unfair and it 's up to the president to dissolve the parliament and call elections when the pm resigns or ca n't find a majority . 
  i mean ancient rome, 
   toltec , olmec , zapotec and mor ** ec **, 
  he is n't counted, 
  blood means little though , every culture has a foundation . 
  in the case of italy that foundation was rome , wheter we look at the birth of the italian state during the risorgimento or the birth of the italian nation during the early renaissance . 
  we should also consider that rome was the only power able to unite italy apart from piedomnt-sardinia . 
  our instability is our stability, 
  that 's a good queastion , i do n't remember . 
  tryng to figure it out, 
  [ less than a month ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/year_of_the_six_emperors ), 
   tacitus and cassius dio wrote that rumours persisted that augustus was murdered by livia , but these are mainly dismissed as malicious fabrications spread by political enemies of the dynasty . 
  some say he was poisoned by his wife livia , hence that `` possibly assassinated '', 
  sure, 
  [ a better image ] ( http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/roman-emperor-reigns-deaths.png ) . 
  [ nice ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/nizza-c\u00f4te_d%27azur.jpg/1200px-nizza-c\u00f4te_d%27azur.jpg ) greece : ancient greece china : ancient china italy : ancient rome bolivia & peru : inca mexico : aztec & maya iran : persia egypt : ancient egypt irak : uruk/sumerians/babylon i think turkey ( hittites ) and syria ( assyrians ) are missing . 
  oh ok then , cause in my country it 's always the head o state that dissolves the parliament and calls for elections . 
  the pm does n't have that power . 
  i do n't understand one thing . 
  who calls for a general election if the opposition wins a motion of no confidence ? 
  it was n't me . 
  i found it on google images, 
  so you basically have china supporting free trade and european integration while the us is somehow protectionist and against the eu .
