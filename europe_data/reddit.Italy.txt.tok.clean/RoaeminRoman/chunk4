  though of those three only the uae can be classified as a moderate dictatorship . 
  besides sex in public in many ways you are more free there than you would be in europe . 
  our governments are always broke because of constant changes in regime , constant waste of money on useless people and foreign aid , and constant waste on infrastructure investments meant more to employ voters and undermine the other political faction than they are for the long-term interest of the nation . 
  add to that the barrier to entry to the economy by foreigners so high that foreign governments from every part of the world try to undermine their regimes . 
  libya and iraq were overthrown in order to de-nationalize their resource reserves , control of which created the utopia that existed in libya regarding free gasoline , health , schooling , and reduced rent even . 
  dictatorship offers consistency , no changing directions every 5 years but 20 or 40 year plans . 
  i can see the appeal , unfortunately in europe dictators tend to be warmongers and butchers rather than economic and social planners with personal excesses that you find in north african and west asian regions . 
  yeah , i support assad too for this reason . 
  our media hides the fact that the syrian anti-assad movement demanded genocide at the protests more than they demanded democracy . 
  you make a valid point , and i appreciate that that factor is more important than their reasons or excuses for using those firearms . 
  the attitude muslims have toward their christian co-nationals these days is very similar to the attitudes european christians had toward their jewish co-nationals in the early 20th century . 
  it 's not quite at the ` stabbed in the back ' myth , but christians in muslim majority countries are among the most persecuted and abused people in this world . 
  you kind of should care . 
  your attitude would basically be like walking into auschwitz as its smoldering with the nazis on the retreat , looking at the piles of bodies and saying ` well i do n't care who started it !, 
  this is wrong ! ', 
  you have the correct moral compass , but christians from muslim majority regions and nations are at risk of genocide . 
  they 've been ethnically cleansed from iraq and syria , turkey historically , and all over north africa with the exception of egypt . 
  however , there are ** a lot ** of muslims who stand up for their christian brothers , but when they 're sitting in a sinking boat or a migrant camp many will view their christian brother 's life as expendable and without a community to judge them they 'll take those lives if necessary . 
  france ... christian ? 
  bro the 50s were a long time ago . 
  well that does explain why cities are more violent than the fields . 
  then again germany is denser than russia but the latter has a much higher rate of violent crime . 
  it does n't really happen . 
  then again there 's plenty of sunlight and good food in the mid east and they seem to kill with enthusiasm . 
  i 'm not sure why we 're so relaxed but its pretty good . 
  yeah dude , there 's 80 mill in germany and 300 mill in usa . 
  lots of people think population is n't a factor to consider when making these evaluation but i think the size , age , and divisions within a society are the prime factors to analyze when asking a question . 
  one should hope so . 
  its not hard to get a doctor to say you 're in good health , so at least there should be this hurdle . 
  never tried to buy a gun before , does n't seem so difficult . 
  yeah , there might have been millions were it not for the holocaust . 
  a few had already begun to leave before the war , and after many of the survivors left . 
  well , there is substantial legislation across europe that goes beyond the mere psychiatric evaluation . 
  arms trafficking is illegal , high powered weapons are illegal etc. 
  i dont know if our gun laws are all that effective in that regard tbh . 
  in italy specifically i think its really a cultural and age-related thing , the sharp decline in gun violence since the 1980s . 
  we never had a problem with the school shooting type of thing so thats probably not what our gun laws are aimed at . 
  ** edit ** : i have a slightly unacademic source of evidence that i often think of . 
  the organized criminal gangs sometimes , or at least in one case , test batches of heroin on addicts and sometimes just let them die or execute them with firearms ( usually the former ) . 
  usually there 's no statistician or journalist around and because the victim is a homeless addict there 's usually nobody to care either . 
  they went to israel, 
  why are you insulting australia ? 
  did you disregard a genocide ? 
  turkish military has a long history of exterminating non-turkish christian populations . 
  i 'd prefer to see the eu as a whole since germany is quite small . 
  again , i made a good point that its most likely an age factor . 
  americans are younger than europeans on average . 
  because the invaders did n't massacre women and children ? 
  also if you want to follow the chain of causation : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istanbul_pogrom which followed : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_genocide edit : better yet , fucker . 
  2,000 greek cypriots were disappeared by the turkish government , taken to a death camp , and never heard from again . 
  you know i 'm not sure if there are . 
  the us collects a lot more data than many european countries . 
  you have a lot of people who live off the grid and up until the 80s and 90s there was a fair amount of gun violence in western europe , domestic terror groups , and mafia wars . 
  europeans are more old than young now which i think is the main reason there is less violence . 
  there are more random massacres and more gun crime in the us , but from what i can see its not much more difficult to acquire a gun there . 
  my guess is that its not only a younger society , but also the racial , cultural , and economic divisions are intractable . 
  they probably are in europe too , and it does seem europe is being americanized in this regard as well . 
  statutes of naked men are n't a central aspect of my culture , they 're just expensive things that we have . 
  italy does n't need to stand up to others to defend its culture , it sits above all others . 
  i do n't feel an injury to my pride when i 've invited over a guest who feels intimidated it . 
  good point, 
  what does that say about our strict approach to gun regulations ? 
  it seems they 're rather ineffective . 
  what i find interesting is how little the international media speculated as to how these jihadist terrorists , who were european nationals , acquired and stockpiled military grade weapons for their attacks . 
  when such things happen in america they blame legality of firearms and gun culture . 
  in europe ? 
  what i want to know is how a supposedly marginalized group in a society that makes it hard to acquire weapons is able to build its own armies . 
  i would have put out her eyes . 
  yeah , and spain was among the most backwards countries in europe until about 20 years ago . 
  the whole concept of gay marriage is also about 20 years old . 
  your country ran to follow the trend because it is ruled by leftists who needed to insult the old fascist elite in your country that was deposed recently . 
  italy has nothing to prove , and there 's really no reason why anyone should be surprised about a country hesitating to do the gay marriage gay adoption thing . 
  this is a first in the history of mankind , any sensible person would prefer to wait and see . 
  gay marriage is a 17 year old concept , i think we can forgive some people from hesitating , no human society has ever had widescale gay weddings, 
  italy is one of the first countries in western europe to decriminalize homosexuality in 1890 . 
  the french were the first , and imposed it on europe in 1822 , many recriminalized italy but italy redecriminalized quite early compared to spain . 
  wouldnt they fall under the same category as spain ? 
  friendly neutrals ? 
  most of your original comment is accurate . 
  its a fair stance , the soviets oppressed many people ( finns , baltics , ukrainians , chechens and ingush etc ) , nothing morally wrong with siding with the enemy of your enemy , most people in the world didnt know about the holocaust until 1944 , up till then it was one army or another . 
  not saying its justified to deport and punish a whole population . 
  the insurgency and the nazis did have things in common , the nazis assisted them and there 's nothing wrong about a pro-independence faction like finns , ukrainians , baltic peoples , or the chechens siding with the nazis out of convenience . 
  but they certainly were n't a maligned loyal minority , the population preferred independence but definitely a lot more chechens and ingush fought for the red army than any insurgency . 
  again , does n't justify punishing the whole population, 
  thats not completely accurate about chechens not seeing nazis before . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1940%e2%80%9344_insurgency_in_chechnya a german expeditionary force helped the chechen insurgency . 
  chechens have been rebelling since russia ever since chechnya was conquered . 
  hope they named him and hope he 's treating the frostbite by drowning himself in bitches . 
  bullshit , the chinese had slavery until 1912 . 
  it doesnt count as a precedent if it starts and stops with one emperor and is reintroduced later . 
  pointless comment bro . 
  not one nation has ever attemptedto abolish the worldwide slave trade . 
  the church did ban slavery in italy several times in the middle ages but each time it banned things like ` slavery of christians ' for instance and ` slavery of children ' and so on and each time it didnt stick and each time it was never meant to reach beyond italian borders . 
  i 'm not so retarded as to pull up your bullshit china example and pretend as if an isolated abolition of slavery is the same as the beginning of a centuries long deliberate policy to ban slavery in every part of the world . 
  the british alone invented that concept and they deserve your respect . 
  empires are definetly a legitimate source of pride . 
  if you look at how and why nations become empires they , more often and not , get dragged into a fight by a prick on their side or the side of a rival power and won . 
  often outnumbered i might add . 
  and what they built and left behind always benefits the conquered whether as a unesco heritage site or invested knowledge of infrastructure , industry , organizational theory , advantageous social or cultural customs , new language ties to other populations conquered by the same nation with whom they would never have interacted were it not for the same experience . 
  most of the proponents of the ` shame ' movements are descended from people who aided and assisted conquerors or they would have been destroyed .
