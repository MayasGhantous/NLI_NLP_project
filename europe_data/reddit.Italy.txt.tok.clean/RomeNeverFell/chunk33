  these tend to make us feel well , kind of like when you 're standing in front of a bonfire or sunbathing . 
  of course it 's a much lower intensity exposure , but having it everyday for several hours a day makes a difference . 
  that 's also probably why those long tube-like ceiling lightbulbs in work/school buildings feel so depressing/annoying . 
  oh c'mon , a 4 years old has the intelligence of an animal . 
  you can not achieve much through mere conversation . 
  it 's like trying to talk your dog out of chewing your shoes . 
  of course it should be something only a parent should be allowed to do . 
  but after the 10th time you tell your child not to draw on the wall a good old spanking is the only thing that can carry the message through . 
  let us be fr\u00e8res . 
  those f1 fans are really hard to stop . 
   where spain is just at italy 's levels fuck man , maths is hard i know . 
   the truth is , you have no idea about spain 's labour market and how it works , other than `` oh you have a higher unemployment rate so it might be worse hurr durr '' . 
  pretty much the same can be said about your knowledge on the spain 's different industries . 
  while you provide not a single argument in favour of your points . 
  aight . 
   ... aaaand yet spain 's gdp per capita is surpassing italy 's . 
  might want to consider write another paper . 
  or use it to clean yourself . 
  yet u poor . 
   you should give a lecture to yourself what ? 
  i think the word you 're looking for is '' read '' . 
   it 's not a situation when you have a high unemployment rate but still grow at 3,5 % , but rather when you have very low growth rates optionally combined with a high unemployment rate . 
  [ ... ] even though the growth rate may be nominally higher than in other countries not experiencing economic stagnation ' . 
  which means , as i advocated before , that a 3.5 % growth is by itself not enough to declare the country is not stagnating . 
   how our labour market works or rather does n't work . 
   you do n't understand because you wo n't be able to explain why we grow at more than 3 % with a 19 % unemployment rate . 
  yes , i explained it before . 
  foreign companies are assuming a predatory behaviour on your [ weak labour market ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) by hiring people to produce things you wo n't reap the benefits of . 
  thus inflating your gdp levels . 
  this is not possible in italy because , differently from you , we already have some of the world 's largest corporations . 
  or maybe you can come here and rewrite neoclassical and philips ' theory . 
   there 's an important amount of undeclared work , and thus not entirely computing in the figure . 
  and still we manage to grow more . 
  we have by far europe 's largest black labour market , with [ the ` ndrangheta 's revenues which are larger than the deutsche bank and mcdonald 's put together ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/26/ndrangheta-mafia-mcdonalds-deutsche-bank-study ) . 
  if we were to include those we 'd probably have a gdp per capita larger than france 's . 
   about something you have a slight idea of it . 
  the fact that i wrote different papers about the subject in one of the world 's 50 best universities suggests i might have some idea about what i 'm talking about . 
   meanwhile , spain is overshadowing italy in gdp per capita while having the czechs at your rear . 
  sure , now hurry up a dutch tourist is waiting for his italian coffee !, 
  [ by production it is meant output , not growth ] ( https://www.google.nl/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gnp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;idim=country:ita:grc:fra&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gnp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ita:esp&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=638488800000&amp;tend=1427410800000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) . 
  which is also known to be off for spain since it does n't reap the profits of its products . 
  for instance many cars are produced in spain , every car produced increases the gdp of spain by its value , on paper , however the profits go to the germans . 
  which is not reported on the gdp data . 
  italy on the other hand has several car industries , which are mostly produced abroad due to lower manufacturing costs . 
  same goes with spanish olive oil being rebranded and sold as italian by italian companies . 
   growing at 0,5-1 % when others are growing 2-4 % is being in stagnation , not actually growing , and the reason why italy fell behind . 
  no , that 's not the definition of stagnation . 
  the us has been growing at around 2 % for the past 20 years and their economy not stagnating . 
  spain on the other hand is stagnating more than any other european country due to its incredibly high unemployment rate . 
   not assumptions , your nationalistic views wo n't allow you to see it . 
  but we do n't need you to see it , do n't worry . 
  a condescending tone does n't make up for basic education . 
   ... which still has 2015 data . 
  and for good reason , it takes time to detrend the data and gather reliable data for a larger basket of products . 
  the imf 's are mostly estimates and aggregates and that 's why no one would use them in an econometric analysis . 
   it 's only logical though , considering italy 's growing at 1 % while spain is above 3 % it 's logical because you were incredibly less productive than us for all of the 20th century . 
  it 's easier to grow when you 're undeveloped , it 's basic convergence theory . 
   and italy has been stagnating for decades . 
  actually in the last 2 decades we 've been always growing except for maybe 4 years . 
   this is not something spain has done well ( although being the fastest growing country among the big ones helped ) ... it 's something italy has n't done well . 
  definitely , we can not devaluate our currency anymore in order to make our exports more competitive . 
   and very soon the czechs will be catching you up , it 's a matter of time unless you do something else . 
  we 've been one the 8 most productive countries in the world since wwii , a mere long wave downturn is not going to bring us to the level of eastern european countries . 
   these are facts these are the assumptions of someone who knows nothing about growth theory . 
  not according to the world bank . 
   you 're comparing spain 's todays figures with italy 's 2008 figures . 
  yes because that 's how you measure potential natural output . 
   spain 2008 figures were 35k which is still way under italy 's . 
   and they 're not 25k $ today , either . 
  yes they are , at least by the world bank measurements . 
  which is the main source we use in economic analysis . 
  a tiny fluctuation in an export product quantity . 
  also the world bank did n't publish its data yet , so i 'll take it with a grain of salt . 
  http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&amp;series=ny.gdp.pcap.cd&amp;country=ita the point is that spain 's current gdp per capita of $ 25 ' 800 is still far from italy 's 40 ' 600 of 2008 . 
  meaning while you 're close to overheating we 're still far from our steady state . 
   spain far behind and get close to the economy size of italy despite less than 1/2 of the population spain has still a lower gdp per capita and a much smaller population , so it 's not close at all . 
   unlike italy that expects its population to decline the nordics will add millions in the next 30 years . 
  bitch please , even all the nordic countries combined have a population which is less than half italy 's . 
  we might decline by 1 million people , and you might grow by a few millions . 
  that wo n't change much . 
  these fucking brits , always stealing italian jobs . 
  that 's rich coming from slovenia . 
  fuck i live just across the border , when was that ? 
  that 's nor ... ah hahahha, 
  his grandfather was in the wermacht ? 
  yes but wales does not deal with foreign policy issues . 
  the whole uk does it , and they do n't do it in welsh . 
  yeah yeah but i 'm referring to the catholic indoctrination . 
  it puts some strong ideas into children . 
  yes they do that . 
  that 's why we 're okay with german war crimes guilt . 
  if you were born in the 90s or earlier yes . 
  pfff it 's just because there 's more of them . 
  and some of the best europeans remain here , while all of genius asians leave their continent . 
  if you go to the riviera romagnola during summer you already see that . 
  that and spaghetti with jam . 
  why then name it just '' the empire '' leaving out '' roman '' and '' holy '' ? 
  i know i know , it turns me on when they cry . 
  we 're still pretty cool . 
  pls rule us and make us solvent again .
