  we also do n't know shit about portugal . 
  i know this will trigger all the portuguese here , but we know much more about brazil . 
  or maybe having scotland in the eu is better for us and them , and that 's it ? 
  di dove sei ? 
   anyone got to montmartre recently without being harrased or groped ? 
  i did . 
  it 's absurd how racist a country that has an emigration problem can be . 
  meh , if you were a barbarian until last week anything you 've done more than once is a tradition . 
  with our help they can succeed this time . 
  also in ni . 
  i really do n't wan na know what that is supposed to be . 
  the fact that you put pesto on everything that is not pasta tells me you made things worse . 
  after trying your food i ca n't say they were wrong . 
  '' breaking news : austrian diplomat stabs putin '', 
  dude fuck off . 
  we 're an impoverished nobleman who wears his father 's white tie and lives in a dusty villa with a large garden which is not taken care of . 
  let us at least impress you with our silverware . 
  and yet fishermen still come home drunk and sleep with the wrong wives . 
   if you ca n't help but stuff your face with pizza every day then that 's your own problem . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_body_mass_index_ ( bmi ) #who _ data_on_prevalence_of_obesity _ .28 bmi _ . e2 .89 . a5_30kg .2 fm2 .29 _ .282014.29 if someone here can not help but stuffing his face with shit food it 's not us . 
   nobody works 100 hours a week except for ceos and bankers i see you 've never met a banker nor a ceo in your life . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:italian_economists we have some of the most prominent economists in the world including mario draghi , the president of the ecb . 
  the second best uni for economics in the continent is in italy . 
   what country ? 
  noneofyourfuckingbusinesstan . 
   i went to a top 15 engineering school in the world and got an undergrad and grad degree , and yet you find yourself trying to defend your country ( as pretty much every of your comments point to ) on r/europe , from which you 'll be banned from pretty soon i reckon . 
  either you 're a fool or lying . 
   and got an education that italians could only dream of . 
  but i live in the u.s. so i have that privilege yeah right bahahahahah, 
  yeah whenever i wan na get shot by a cop or an autistic 16 years old , work 100 hours a week with little to no vacation in order to pay for education and medical bills i 'll call you up . 
  i 'm already majoring in econ in one of the top 80 unis in the world so yeah . 
  oh and i 'm paying like a 1000 euros a year . 
  be careful not to do that in your local high school !, 
  blah blah blah turning to personal comments because you 're full of shit , as if one would expect any other kind of response from an americhien . 
  hope one day you people can one day have enough confidence not to freak out every time one says something negative about your country . 
  '' on mass shootings , which disproportionately involve weapons like the ar-15 , a civilian version of the military m16 rifle '' so yeah it 's an assault rifle . 
  also , no shit handguns kill more people since they 're much more common . 
  2 % of murders committed using military grade weapons is still a fucking large number for any developed country . 
   this chart categorizes all rifles under one category how does this prove any of your points ? 
   the thousands of gang related murders that are never solved in which it is not known what kind of weapon is used . 
  how the fuck you do n't know what kind of weapon was used . 
   http://goal.org/newspages/awb-truth.html so you post a link from a sketchy website with '' facts '' from the '' national shooting sports foundations '' whose mission statement is '' nssf is working day in and day out to promote , protect and preserve our industry and our sports '' . 
  and i 'm not supposed to call you a stupid cunt . 
   because you 're obviously misinformed on the matter . 
  oh maybe i misread how many people are killed by firearms in your country compared to other developed countries . 
  or maybe you 're a stupid gun-loving cunt . 
   it was stupid bullshit  looking like a moron talking about class huh ? 
   objectively wrong [ source needed ]  [ source needed ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srkfdcx_72c https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnzn3q-vgwi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mwn5ndajws https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mwtwz_agyk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yicyjrgxw0 also , again , trump . 
   anecdotal evidence ? 
  typical italian does n't know how facts work . 
  ( see , you 're not the only one who can peddle generalizations ) . 
  not really , a randomised sample is what statistics are based on . 
  if we consider the people i meet randomly and have a conversation as random ( which is pretty weak assumption to make ) then i can come up with a reasonable model to predict that , overall , muricans will have a lower culture than the average western european . 
  also people can come to their own conclusions without having statistics about it and be generally wrong . 
  i do n't need statistics to have an idea of which neighbourhoods i will most likely to get mugged . 
   and you elected berlusconi . 
  end of argument . 
  berlusconi is a man who came from a poor family and made his way up to become the richest man in the country . 
  before being elected into office he was a family man . 
  debates between the two major political parties exponents looked like this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbgv8kpcdgg rather than this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dolkmdrmuc . 
  when it became obvious what kind of person he really was we impeached him , while you knew exactly what you were buying and still went for it . 
   a trash economy the number of hobos per capita in your streets compared to ours is more than 10 folds . 
  also you have a much higher gini coefficient than we do ( yours is between oligarchic russia and fucking qatar ) , meaning that you have more money overall , but it 's in the hands of so little people the median american is poorer than the median italian . 
   that produces nothing in the way of scientific and technological advancements https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_italian_inventions both the number and importance of italian inventions vastly exceed the murican ones . 
   it has to do with having a basic respect for other people regardless of where they were born . 
  respect is earned . 
  in the last 70 years the american people have done a lot in order to lose the basic respect we had . 
   are you going to comment on the fact that you assumed he was american and were completely wrong ? 
  it was some light-hearted banter , i ca n't be assed tbh . 
   how would you feel if i said `` ha !, 
  typical italian ca n't do five seconds of research ! '', 
  would you consider that `` well founded animosity '' ? 
  not really , of all the true or untre stereotypes we have this not really one of them . 
   suggesting that all americans are stupid and do n't know basic geography is not only completely false , but it 's bigotry . 
  i never said that , but it is true that most of them do n't . 
  i lived in the us and it 's a well known trivia . 
  also the fact that you elected donald trump makes us pretty sure you 're the ones who can not do 5 seconds of research ( and are stupid ) . 
   if you have any integrity at all you 'll delete your bigoted , incorrect comment and try to have a little bit more class in the future . 
  pointing out how you 're the cultural sick man of the developed countries has little to do with class . 
  also , chill . 
  oh shit , i did n't know you were deaf and illiterate . 
  non lo so , ma ha a che fare con il clero . 
  it 's mostly because you do not necessarily know your neighbour and it could be an important or expensive item . 
  you 're just taking a risk for no useful reason . 
  which is what most europeans think about american/british songs before learning english . 
  indeed . 
  nah we use dolphins . 
  much water . 
  wow . '', 
  yeah but it 's also not my duty to look after my neighbour 's shit . 
  like if i drop your package and break something or just lose it i should n't be liable . 
  and that 's why i would n't have my neighbour do it . 
  nah giving it to your neighbour would be weird . 
  when they did it here in the nl i was kinda pissed . 
  i doubt venice really stands a chance . 
  perhaps a bestemmie-powered cannon or an artisanal tank could be implemented . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur43q6a_afq ) is a much better example . 
  you mentioned a personal experience which does not really prove shit , said that a gun which is clearly built for military purposes is not such , and finally you mentioned a statistics which is blatantly bullshit . 
  wtf am i supposed to say except calling you a stupid cunt ? 
  and for good reasons .
