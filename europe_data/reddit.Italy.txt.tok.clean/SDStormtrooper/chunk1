russophillic means that we have a fetish for russian people . 
  i think you mean that italy has the most russian supporters in terms of political decisions in europe . 
  or maybe because this is a subreddit about europe , where the vast majority of men are `` uncut '' , as you put it . 
  maybe because france has a bigger music industry ? 
  i do n't know man , letting them sneak to northern european countries is often not a solution . 
  there 's a saying in italy : `` the times were better when the times were worse '' i think this parade incapsulates it . 
  especially for louis theroux . 
  cheeky . 
  cool , thanks . 
  so what 's the general opinion on wogs ? 
  i thought `` wogs '' was a term for dark skinned europeans ? 
  ( greeks/italians etc ? ), 
   suggesting the local politicians preferred the method currently used because it is rather labour intensive and might boost the local economy seems like a pretty good idea to me , actually . 
  yeah , but maybe the language part makes it a bit too easy . 
  also romania is way bigger than belgium . 
  is this / r/atheism now ? 
  oh , sorry for my dumbness then !, 
  that 's what a nation-specific subreddit is for . 
  that 's a very dumb line of thinking . 
  i like to grow my own tomatoes , and yet there 's plenty of tomatoes produced from huge farms , does that mean i 'm wasting good tomatoes from the supermarket ? 
  it 's probably going to be that company that sells vegeta . 
  that shit is amazing . 
  fret not thyself !, 
  he 's going to start paying the pesky debts by selling his unusual hats on the market . 
  definitely , we got some of the worst cheddar imaginable over here . 
  ugh , such is life . 
  that 's because you 're getting italian and spanish olive oil in the uk , not in italy or spain . 
  just like greek olive oil here is ... let 's say subpar . 
  i agree , my friend . 
  come to italy instead . 
  nutella + mango condom + coke + mentos = record del mondooooo, 
  # [ italia ] ( https://youtu.be/59l51ywufiq?t=1m34s ) # [ sii ] ( https://youtu.be/59l51ywufiq?t=1m34s ), 
  i read it as `` girl gets community service '' , and was even more confused . 
  apparently spying on allies is a good thing now . 
  i ca n't believe how adamantly citizens defend their government . 
  you do realize by conceding that your government fucked up you do n't concede that * you * fucked up ? 
  this is the thing that bugs me most on the internet is blind nationalism , the government does n't necesserily speak for you , you can share a different view that does n't agree with fucked up spying shenanigans , as a normal person would . 
  he/she did n't !, 
  if you are in germany/italy/france / spain and a bunch of other countries we have our own way of speaking latin which goes back to the middle ages . 
  for example the italian pronunciation follows ecclesiastical latin : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecclesiastical_latin chart of latin pronunciation : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_regional_pronunciation, 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/europa#latin the pronunciation following classical latin ipa is there . 
  the people who sing in that video seem to pronounce it as / \u0254yr\u0254pa / ( atleast that 's what my untrained ear in german hears ), 
  i do n't know about that . 
  you can how many years there are left in the future ? 
  well ... it does . 
  also those people speaking latin in that anthem seems to be german ( ? ), 
  by the way they pronounce europa . 
  those are n't germany . 
  nor did they come from the geographical place where modern germany is , they came from denmark . 
  germany ? 
  err ? 
  i like all the macrons in latvian , reminds me of reading latin in high school . 
  she experienced the fucking war , i bet that would convince anybody why europe should seek unity . 
  how odd , 3 out of 4 countries you mentioned are in a certain union . 
  days ? 
  an italian politician was arrested in sweden for slapping their child once . 
  croatia is one of the few places in the balkans italians know about because it 's a cheap vacation place , because of venetian colonization , the [ foibe killings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foibe_killings ) and because istria was party of italy . 
  yeah , i never said they were n't . 
  i guarantee you a vast number of those protesters are n't actually from rome itself , but from some small towns that have been secluded from the bigger world for centuries and have recently refused to change their trash ideology . 
  source : i was from one of those places . 
  i hope this is what happens, 
  10/10 edgy response i would expect from reddit , great job . 
  i did n't mention a thing aobut corsica , unless you think corsica is part of italy . 
   arabs  huge influence on italy you 're trying to prove that someone 's ignorant while being ignorant yourself . 
  please stop saying such idiotic things and spreadic misconceptions . 
  it might 've had huge influences in sicily , the `` huge '' influence that the arabs posed on mainland italy was a city being controlled by them for 30 years . 
  yes, 
  nevada is n't in italy lsat time i checked . 
  are you a female by any chance ? 
  traditionally in what span of time ? 
  the last 100 years ? 
  sure . 
  you are what ? 
  there is no gene which differentiate romans from other populations . 
  you mean you are genetically close to greeks or southern europeans ? 
  yeah , probably . 
  but as a matter of fact , a vast number of non-convert ethnic greek population went away from turkey during the population exchange . 
  ( fyi : i 'm aware the exchange was n't based on ethnicity , but on religious grounds ), 
  you think we want them or can handle them ? 
  a very bad one at that , considering the genocide of ethnic greeks , the massive population exchange or the fact that constantinople had barely any inhabitants left and roman identity was very weak by the 16th as a result of de-urbanization caused by a weak roman economy . 
  the point is that roman did n't mean turkish . 
   romans - which meant the turkish no it did n't , it meant what we now call byzantium or eastern roman empire . 
  well , first of all because literally nobody else would see that message and the op in your picture was romanian . 
  what ... 
  what a shitty , sweeping generalization . 
  as opposed to germany , italy , spain and france where before the unification they did n't speak different languages or had an ounce of national identity ? 
  [ this should answer all your questions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq0csdlua9a ) disclaimer : i do n't know if that man in the video is chinese, 
  all 10 million of you are n't into photography , what an unfortunate fate !, 
  you should 've checked out some villages outside of rome , people are nice there . 
  i like the italian version better  sono pazzi questi romani ( these romans are crazy ) check out that acronym  edit : changed porci ( pigs ) to pazzi ( crazy ), 
  definitely , i remember there being a lot of romanians even in the early 2000 's . 
  there 's little truth to that , while romanian immigration was definitely facilitated by the eu and romanians are [ the main immigrant group ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_italy ) , literally every other immigrant group comes from outside the eu . 
  they ca n't , darwin awards are for people who have n't spread their genes . 
  it would be nice if you wrote in a language most other people on reddit understood . 
  that 's not what a euro coin is . 
  nope , it actually is . 
  ( source : french teacher from long ago ), 
  there is no animal on the italian coin ( unless you count humans ), 
  i 've never been to naples but i ca n't imagine it 's that bad . 
  though there are certain stereotypes about it ...
