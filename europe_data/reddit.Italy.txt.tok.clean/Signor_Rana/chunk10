  there are also italian armed forces . 
  so nope . 
   scotland is a country because it is considered a country in the international organization for standardization ( iso ) list of countries it 's not though : http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm also here : http://data.okfn.org/data/core/country-list and here : http://userpage.chemie.fu-berlin.de/diverse/doc/iso_3166.html the only part of iso 3166 where scotland shows up is iso 3166-2 : gb , which is the list of principal subdivisions of the united kingdom : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_3166-2:gb cheers !, 
  so then you 're a tier 1 subdivision of the united kingdom that calls itself a `` country '' ? 
  cool beans bro , that 's what i was saying all along . 
  in some other countries they call those `` states '' even !, 
  who is the ambassador plenipotentiary of scotland to italy ? 
  lol no , you 're a region/province/tier 1 administrative subdivision of the uk . 
  the fact that you call that level of subdivision `` country '' does n't make it so .

  no , i think you guys might be too focused on the routine task of having to explain that `` public school '' means something different in the uk to realize i do understand it and i 'm making a joke about something a user said . 
  as for what i specifically said above , there are still some male-only public schools , but more than half of the recognized ones are co-educational according to wikipedia . 
  i 'm sorry but none of these are in english , which is the purpose of this list . 
  added !, 
   anti human rights does fit with anti-immigrant no , it does n't , and it 's very dishonest to try to connect the two . 
  `` anti-human rights '' can be `` fit '' to pretty much any political position , you just need to push it in a way that breaks human rights . 
  for example , i can promote socio-economic equality by purporting to murder all the rich people . 
  does that then mean that defenders of socio-economic equality are against human rights ? 
   and testimony of brexit , also anti-immigrant correlates with anti-eu . 
  yes , the point is that they are not the same or similar to `` authoritarian populism '' . 
  added !, 
  added !, 
  i know but i 'm pretty sure there are n't only male-only public schools . 
  `` totalitarian '' has a specific meaning , it 's not just `` people who are mean and impose their will on others '' . 
   apart from female ejaculation and ** menstruation ** i thought these were standard practice in public schools . 
  are female pupils put on massive dosages of hormones to stop menstruation completely ? 
   and that italian island i forgot the name of . 
  sardinia . 
  do n't worry , we tend to forget about it too . 
  added !, 
  added !, 
  ah , so just like in italy . 
  here we do n't have one minimum wage but rather many different ones based on the specific industry , but it is always skirted using legal and illegal means . 
   i wonder why these parties seem so surprised that the working class have turned to the more right-leaning parties in the west when they 've been abandoned by the left for so long now . 
  because of their perspective . 
  the party elites are human beings , just like you and i. 
  they inevitably are influenced by their environment , especially the people they spend their time with , and who do they spend their time with ? 
  highly educated , wealthy ( or at least comfortable ) party functionaries , politicians , analysts , journalists etc , the same is true for much of the press . 
  and so they are almost only exposed by viewpoints of these same people . 
  they do n't get the sense of urgency and rage that other classes of people feel regarding things like immigration or the eu , if they see issues at all they are distant in their minds , not close and pressing . 
  the independent has become complete garbage since they went digital . 
  in terms of pure density of factual errors , misconceptions and misrepresentation per article , i am not joking when i say it feels * worse * than the damn daily mail . 
   with some controversial topics it is hard to ask direct questions , because people will know the `` right '' answert to give . 
  in these cases you have to ask different questions with less obvious answers to reveal the preference , using statistical methods . 
  put it another way , specifically investigating actual authoritarian populism would yield unimpressive low results , so they muddy the waters by asking about things that some authoritarian populists also agree with , and pretending that therefore everyone who agrees with them is an authoritarian populist . 
   what ever happened to the left caring about the poor and working classes of their own countries real talk here : successive generations of leftist leaders in nearly all european countries became more and more removed from the labour movement and more and more engaged with party politics . 
  and party politics is an environment of educated , wealthy people , reflecting inevitably an educated , wealthy perspective , where the scale of priorities is inevitably skewed towards those of educated , wealthy people . 
  and some point or the other , differing based on the country and party , there was a realization that the ideas held by the party elite were more in line with those of culturally-left , educated , middle-class and up voters than with those of uneducated , poor , working class voters . 
  and then the party that used to be on the left became center-left , and then in many cases barely distinguishable from center . 
  this is the trajectory that the italian mainstream left followed , and it seems to me that it 's the one the british mainstream left followed as well , for example . 
  the culturally-left elite has lost a sense of working class consciousness because it 's a ) not made up of working class people for the most part and b ) not even engaged with working-class organizations , groups and struggles anymore , again for the most part . 
  none of this makes sense , sorry . 
  first , they are not calling it a map of correlations , but a map of europeans `` with authoritarian populist views '' . 
  it 's a declarative statement . 
  second , they could just ask directly about authoritarian populist views , there 's no point in seeking ** only ** correlations with other views . 
  the truth of the matter is what / u/raskol _ explained : they 're fitting a political lens that was developed in britain for thatcher 's policies to everything else in europe . 
  which , predictably , has ridiculous results . 
   `` authoritarian populism '' was a term created by british left-wing academics to describe the policies of margaret thatcher in the 1980s . 
  thank you for the info . 
  it may be appropriate as a descriptor for british politics ; i 'm not enough of an expert on it and wo n't comment . 
  but it 's ridiculous to extend that idea to the rest of europe . 
  `` authoritarian '' and `` populism '' have their own meanings , and it 's at best confusing and at worst knowingly disingenous to use them anyway while earkening back to a little-known piece of political analysis from one european country . 
  is it enforceable ? 
  by which i mean : does spain have those devilish type of work contracts that are supposed to be for `` flexibility '' or apprentiships or young people , but in reality are just a way to skirt legal limitations like minimum wage ? 
  the us is totalitarian ? 
  france and the uk in the first half of the 20th century were totalitarian ? 
  the counter-examples mount a little fast for that generalization to hold . 
  added !, 
   the theoretical foundations of authoritarian populism ( anti-human rights , anti-eu , anti-immigrant , pro-strong foreign policy ) thank you for digging this out . 
  of the four `` foundations '' that they cite , only the first has anything to do with authoritarianism , and the latter are not necessarily populist . 
  what a crap , biased study . 
  aaaand it 's published in the independent , what a surprise ... 
  added !, 
  i 'm gon na need to see the definition of `` authoritarian populist views '' . 
  in fact the whole study would be nice . 
  edit : it looks like their measures were `` anti-human rights , anti-eu , anti-immigrant , pro-strong foreign policy '' , as discovered by / u/hungriges _ skelett right below . 
  you make of that what you will , to me it seems that throwing opposition to the eu in the same cauldron as opposition to human rights is exceedingly dishonest . 
  added !, 
   honestly , if the shoe fits . 
  there are serious similarities . 
  hitler came to power on the back of a large paramilitary , in a time of unparalleled political violence , where the topic of the day in the reichstag was the enactment of special laws to punish the mounting number of political murders . 
  he had been running for a few decades on an open platform of superiority of the aryan race and the necessity to conquer lebensraum in the east . 
  trump wants to stop illegal immigration through the southern border and introduce extreme vetting of anyone who applies for a us visa and comes from a country that stands at a high risk of terrorism . 
  people do this bait-and-switch whereby they find loose similarities based on nationalism , and then extend it far past the point those similarities end to imply that trump could be going down the same path as hitler . 
  and that 's misguided at best , if not knowingly dishonest . 
  added !, 
  so trump is also de gaulle then ?
