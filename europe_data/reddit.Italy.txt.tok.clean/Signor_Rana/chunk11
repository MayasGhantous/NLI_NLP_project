  do you mind if i only put in the free site ? 
  the idea is to have a resource for people wanting to get informed about a european country 's matters , which means almost certainly they wo n't a subscription to sta . 
   what percentage of these boats manage to complete their journey , i.e. 
  land on italy 's shores almost none . 
  even years ago , when they actually attempted the full crossing , the smugglers usually sent the migrants swimming away from shore , to avoid being caught . 
  now they purposefully put themselves at sea knowing they wo n't reach land , so they 'll be rescued . 
   or greek islands most of them make it . 
  greece and turkey are much , much closer to each other than libya and lampedusa ( italy 's southernmost island ) . 
  in the aegean it 's easy to physically land on a greek island starting from turkey . 
   the european union should have forced the arab league , oic , and gcc , to pay for shelters and camps to house these people in temporarily . 
  but that 's the mistake though : these are not refugees . 
  the vast majority of these people do n't qualify for asylum according to italian law , not even for subsidiary protection . 
  it 's not a matter of sheltering them anywhere , it 's a matter of making sure these people no longer think they can abuse asylum laws to set foot in europe and then establish themselves here . 
  they are part of eurmedfor , a eu sea rescue mission . 
  they do n't station themselves off the coast of libya , but they answer emergency calls from there . 
  there are ngo ships that do station themselves there , purposefully to help migrants cross with as little risk as possible . 
  personally i consider them complicit in human trafficking and in every death that 's caused by ships capsizing or sinking .

  you guys are making the list !, 
  i just put in the first three and then i 'm editing in the rest , which is no big deal at all . 
  once it 's ready we all benefit , me first since i plan on making an rss feed and finally be able to read european news from european sources , 
  added !, 
  added !, 
  you tell me . 
  the idea is to have european users put forth what they think are passable news sources for their country in english , so if you think that 's a bad source we can avoid adding it .

   france needs labour market reforms , nobody denies it . 
  i hope you guys wo n't be taken by the same mania for labour market reforming as we have . 
  we 've had a reform from every government since 1994 , each one progressively reducing worker 's rights . 
  the result has been stagnating labour productivity ( enterpreneurs stopped investing in innovation of products and processes and started hiring cheaper workers thanks to new contracts ) , stagnating wages and high unemployment . 
  we needed labour reforms , just not the ones we got . 
  and from what i read of this guy , he 's likely to go in that direction .

  it 's the new normal because the incentive structure is fundamentally unchanged since last year . 
  to stop people coming we need to change the incentive structure : prevent migrants from exploiting the asylum system for the purpose of economic immigration , and use the leverage of aid and investment to force african and asian countries to take them back . 
  only by making it completely clear that entering illegally will never result in you settling in europe will we stop the influx of people . 
   no clinical guideline , but a couple of years ago a popular musician , otherwise a healthy man in his forties , died from flu complications , which made rounds in local press . 
  that 's a bit of a far cry from a generalized `` you stand a risk of complications '' statement . 
  the musician might have had an unknown condition , or he might have been the 1 in 100,000 unlucky case . 
  to determine whether the risk of complications in a healthy individual are higher than the risk of complications from the treatment itself is why we use clinical guidelines . 
  the joke is actually about trump legally opposing a wind farm near his golf course in scotland : http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-loses-battle-to-stop-wind-farm-near-his-scottish-golf-resort-1450275439, 
  i have a good friend who is a physician and , for his little part , he can confirm . 
  he says that there 's a lot of overmedication in italy , too much doing things just because people want * something * done and do n't want to hear that you just have to let your body work through certain things like infections and small injuries . 
  there are also trends and fashions in medicine that influence this , such as when a couple of decades ago it became in vogue to remove the tonsils from everyone , which was completely unnecessary in the vast majority of cases . 
   for starters , even if it were true , it 's rude and unnecessary . 
  uh , no , it 's kinda necessary to make sure a person understands that her age might make something she wants to do much more dangerous . 
  like it or not , older women are at an increased risk of miscarriage , and after your friend had two it 's part of her ob 's duty to make sure she understands the risk factors since she might want to attempt a third pregnancy . 
  i do n't know if he put it in terms of `` your fault '' , which would have been unnecessary , but a doc giving you straight facts about your health is kind of fundamental . 
   if left untreated , flu can result in serious life-threatening complications . 
  i mean , can you back that up with some clinical guideline ? 
  i know they do flu vaccine shots for at risk people such as the elderly , the very young and those with certain chronic conditions , but i 've never heard of healthy adults needing flu treatment to avoid the risk of seriously life-threatening complications . 
  thanks , that 's fantastic . 
  thanks !, 
  films !, 
  i like everything about this . 
  i like the planetary rings design of the spacecraft , i like the stretch design of the alien ( or their exosuits ) , i like the prospected ambiguity of whether they are dicks or maybe the conflict arises for other reasons . 
  i like what i assume is a russian chav from some infamous neighborhood ? 
  i hope this comes out with good english subs . 
  and if any russians have other interesting russian sci-fi i 'd love to hear about that . 
   implying isis is even real that 's an interesting theory , tell us more . 
   isis was supported by the west when they werent killing westerners but only shiites . 
  to be more precise , radical islamists that later coalesced into isis were supported by several , but not all western countries so long as they appeared useful in overthrowing assad . 
  nobody had an interest , negative or positive , in shiite deaths . 
  lol who the hell made this ? 
  the democratic party in italy is a mainstream political party with the usual atlantist/anti-russia standpoint ... 
  i 'd like to know who these `` individuals '' are and what exactly their `` association '' is . 
   yet the us still produces more then it did before . 
  looking at aggregate data means masking those who lost out by pretending their lives are better because someone else won . 
  the rust belt just turned on the democrats for this , you sure you want to commit the sama analytical mistake ?
