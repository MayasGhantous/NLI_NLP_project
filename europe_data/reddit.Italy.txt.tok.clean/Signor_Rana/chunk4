  i was more interested in the merits of the actual issue though . 
   so what you are saying is we did n't close our borders . 
  i do n't understand why everyone in this conversation is so eager to rephrase what i said in ways that better suit their narrative . 
  i said what i said , i doubt you did n't understand , but just in case : no , what i 'm saying is that they refused to block passage to a known , specific set of people whom the authorities knew had no right to enter austria and germany . 
  i have made no calls for a general closing of the border . 
   because this `` they all came because of mutti '' argument is basically a clone of the swedish rape story , where every non-swede right-winger is convinced the country is a mad max-ish hellhole as the real swedes quietly cringe about it interesting how you systematically need to bring up irrelevant strawmen . 
  by the way , a young boy was gang-raped by five afghanis in a swedish forest just a few days ago . 
  it 's not mad max , but maybe there is a little bit of a problem ? 
   as for those who were already in hungary , that was nothing but a question of logistics . 
  with or without arrangements they all would 've arrived to germany anyways most definitely not . 
  they arrived in busses near the austrian border , where they could have been stopped easily - and the same if they had attempted to go by train . 
  both highways and trains are very easy chokepoints to control . 
  the problem with doing that is that it would have required riot police - and nobody wanted video of policemen beating migrants . 
  at least i 'm glad that we came to discuss the specifics of the matter . 
  it 's a refreshing change of tune from the rest of your comments in this conversation . 
   a perfect solution ah yes , remind me in which commment did i call for a `` perfect '' solution ? 
  any link ? 
  then stop arguing against strawmen , thank you . 
  germany has a border and a border patrol , germany has control of its train and road networks , as did austria . 
  the column of immigrants from hungary that started this mess could have been stopped at any time much the same way any column of unauthorized people can be stopped - with riot police and physical barriers . 
   right , so her appearing welcoming was the reason of it all . 
  i doubt you truly did n't understand what i wrote , so why do you engage in this nonsense ? 
  is it so unthinkable to consider that it might have been a mistake to open the gates and facilitate the onward transfer of those inbound for hungary ? 
  we ca n't build a wall in the med , but we can : - prosecute the ngos who are complicit with people smugglers and sieze their ships : https://giphy.com/gifs/l3vr2he3ofe19bajg - suspend any and all forward rescue missions , maintaining only regular maritime patrol - begin forcibly taking the prints of migrants all of these things we can do with reasonable ease , if we get over the unfounded notion that enabling dangerous sea traffic saves rather than imperils lives . 
  facts speak much louder than words , and germany opening the gates was much more of an invitation than anything merkel could have said . 
  this `` but she did n't * say * it '' circlejerk needs to die . 
   wishful thinking never led anywhere good either . 
  i agree , the commission should definitely stop deluding themselves and deceiving the european people into thinking turning greece into a migrant camp will lead to anything good . 
  i was hoping someone from luxembourg would show up and say that . 
  it 's true , the corporate tax rate in luxembourg is higher . 
  in fact , if you incorporate in luxembourg city , it 's an astonishing 29 % . 
  are all these companies then mad to incorporate in luxembourg ? 
  of course not . 
  because the 29 % tax rate is on commercial activity . 
  on intellectual property income and royalties , though , there 's an 80 % exemption , for a grand total of 5.8 % . 
  which is much lower than the corporate tax rate of even the most fabulous european alternatives . 
  and is further lowered by individual tax agreements , which can allow a company to structure its business in such a way as to minimize its tax exposure even to the lowered tax rate . 
  which is why all of these companies , which are not run by idiots , incorporate themselves in a tiny city-state with little else to offer in terms of business opportunities . 
   ** logic ** is against marine le pen , as it was with trump and brexit . 
   it is , of course , ** unthinkable ** that the leader of the rightwing , populist , anti-immigration front national should become president of the french republic in elections next may  to be sure , ** most of those i talk to ** are still confident that she will lose to fran\u00e7ois fillon  a resentment one encounters at every turn against ** a political class seen as remote ** , self-serving and corrupt here 's another of that abundant breed of leftist politicos and professionals who lives in his own class bubble and thinks his class interests and perspectives coincide with logic , reason and inevitability . 
   but people like you did n't catch that . 
  instead you got feed the media dribble that she was `` opening the gates '' . 
  you and half the world . 
  and now you think she was a unthinking bleeding heart i understand your dick gets hard when you can imagine yourself smarter than random strangers on the internet , but you should n't base that on fantasies . 
  if you had asked me ( but then were you interested in finding out ? 
  no , just in stroking your `` i 'm smarter than the rubes '' boner ) , i 'd have told you that merkel 's move was dictated by spur-of-moment political opportunism , made at the very moment a column of refugees set for the austrian border and not even intended to be an opening of the gates . 
  like i said thrice now , what she said and what her actions communicated are two entirely separate matters . 
   rather than the person who pushed italy and greece to the limit for 4 years by giving them no support . 
  yes i surely would n't be aware of that . 
  after all i only live in italy , down here we are totally unaware of what merkel had been saying for years while the migrant crisis mounted . 
   if dublin was enforced the entire point of what happened last year was that dublin * could not be enforced * . 
  there were simply too many people for greece or anyone else to handle in the normal manner . 
   if you are against merkel 's migration policy , you will welcome this reversion back to dumping everyone in greece . 
  the only thing i 'd welcome is detention until expulsion of all illegal economic immigrants . 
  dumping them in greece is no solution . 
   it 's not like denying children of illegal immigrants is not racist how is it racist to deny something based on visa status with zero variables relating to race ? 
  under le pen 's plan , a white australian visa overstayer would not be able to send his children to school for free , but a black frenchman or black legal immigrant would . 
   dear media , can you stop being worthless and retarded lying sacks of shit for like a year or something so we can try to not have the eu die ? 
  the amount of self-criticism that the mainstream media would need to undertake in order to start giving fair treatment to topics like nationalism and immigration is mind-bending , and i mean that literally . 
  reporters live in a world of wealthy , highly educated people who mostly share an establishment view of issues ; it would take an incredible individual and institutional effort to recognize the biases inherent in this state of things and consciously counteract them . 
   the context of a last remaining solution considering it 's not a solution no , it does n't put it in the correct context at all . 
   if you want to direct your criticism to the only agent that made an effort i 'll direct my criticism to all that i think deserve it , but this article is about an action undertaken by the commission , so i think it 's understandable to focus on it . 
   if you remove eu and the commission from the picture , you 're left with a continent that would have told greece and italy from the very beginning would something along the lines of : `` they 're coming to you , deal with them . 
  oh and by the way do n't you dare violate human rights conventions . 
  here 's some token financial support , have fun . '', 
  but this is exactly what happened . 
  my country and greece were told to deal with them ourselves both before , during and after the peak of the crisis . 
  at no point did any other country or any european institution take an interest in solving the problem for the sake of italy or greece : the interest was always and only in solving the problem for themselves . 
  the issue did not even get on the european agenda until it spilled out of greece . 
   even if they can still leave i.e. 
  bulgaria and live illegally in germany instead , assigning them a country regardless of their wishes would be a big deterrence for economic migrants . 
  it 's not illegal for refugees to move within the eu , as they are granted the same freedom of movement as anyone else ; what they are not granted is asylum support outside the country that granted them asylum , but it 's a very simple calculus to conclude that working in germany is a far more lucrative opportunity than getting a pittance in asylum support in eastern europe . 
  so no , the deterrence is flimsy if it exists at all . 
   i remember her saying to her own people we will help syrian refugees and we can do this . 
  not inviting everyone . 
  see above as to the relevance of what she said vs what she did . 
   it did voice an opposition for the past 2 years this does n't magically erase its current support , so no the criticism is pointed precisely where it 's due . 
   then they would be accused of being out of touch i 'm sure they would be accused of a lot of things , but i do n't understand why you 'd expect me to care . 
  of course the commission exorting the member states not to take the easy way out would piss them off . 
  that 's what it 's supposed to do . 
  a eu commission that does n't act as a unifier but rather an enabler of destructive behaviour is useless and the integrity of their precious feelings is of no value to me . 
   but they already are the buffer zone . 
  no , they are not . 
  as evidenced by the million + people that went right through that buffer zone into your country . 
   if the goal is to contain them in greece , all that is needed is to enforce current law . 
  which is exactly what is happening . 
   why bother trying to push through quotas against immense pressure , if that 's your end goal ? 
  because a show of effort to find a solution that did n't * exclusively * rely on screwing greece over had to be made . 
  all such plans require two parts : the carrot and the stick . 
  if you use the stick only , you create resistance and look rather cruel . 
  remember when merkel invited the entire middle east into europe ( no , the fact that she did n't literally say `` you are invited '' is meaningless , she opened the doors which was an even clearer invitation ) , then wanted to force the consequences of that mistake on nations that opposed it from the start ? 
  well this is a consequence of that . 
   the idea was that they 'd eventually get distributed from there so greece would only have to take a fair share . 
  this is a pitiful delusion : the idea was always to first make sure greece became europe 's migrant buffer zone , and then once the problem was contained there some kind of solution might eventually hopefully perhaps be worked out . 
  the second part was not essential : it 's the containment aspect which was the key and core of it , and it 's why it was implemented first and forced on the greeks with all the pressure the eu could apply . 
   it 's fundamentally unfair to say they 're giving this plan a `` full-throated support '' `` the european commission on thursday said greece has improved in hosting and registering arriving asylum-seekers . 
  ** it recommended that eu states be allowed to send back to greece asylum-seekers ** who enter the bloc that way and make it deeper into europe from mid-march onwards . '', 
  if you do n't support a course of action , you do n't recommend it . 
  things they could have recommended instead : - that members states quicken the pace of expulsions of illegal immigrants - that member states send extra personnel to help greece deal with its situation - that member states do anything except just dump migrants back into greece and wash their hands of the whole affair so no , the criticism is neither unfair nor misdirected . 
  the commission maintained the full ability to voice an opposition to this lunacy ; it did n't , which means it does n't want to .
