   eu gets its mandate from the member states and is primarily ran by member state politicians . 
  the eu commission , which is the entity in question , gets its mandate from the european parliament and is primarily ran by commissioners without a member state affiliation . 
  the entire point of the commission is to put overarching eu interests front and center and act as an executive counterbalance to the council of ministers , the organ wherein member-state interests are meant to be represented . 
  so no . 
  their job is to * not * go along with the shitty selfish things that member states want to do . 
  it ca n't override them ( i never said it can ) , but it should n't give them its full-throated support either . 
  `` keep in mind that this is an extreme oversimplification , just to give you the idea . 
  in reality , it 's a game of cat and mouse between regulators being pressure by the public to put a stop to these schemes , and corporate lawyers come out with new ones to get around new regulation . '', 
  that national governments would pursue their interests and dump the refugee problem on greece alone is sad but expected ; that eu authorities would not just tolerate , but endorse and empower this behaviour is shameful and despicable . 
   why do we allow companies to choose where they pay taxes for the whole union and why do we allow companies to pay taxes outside of the eu for profit made within ? 
  you are * supposed to * pay taxes where you generate a profit . 
  what happens is that very highly paid corporate accountants and lawyers devise legal fictions by which a company pretends its profits where generated in a different , more `` tax friendly '' country . 
  a classic scheme is the following : - mcdonalds italia operates fast-food joints in italy , where it sells food and beverages for a profit . 
  - mcdonalds italia pretends to license its brand name , men\u00f9 and marketing material from mcdonalds luxembourg ; the italian subsidiary gets to claim these license fees as expenditures , reducing their tax liability in italy . 
  - of course , this means that those license fees are now paid to mcdonalds luxembourg , which consequently earns a tidy profit . 
  but , would n't you know , coincidentally mcdonalds luxembourg is located in a tax jurisdiction with very low corporate tax rate and , what 's more , the local government gave it a `` tax ruling '' that allows it to pay even fewer taxes than normal !, 
  - mcdonalds italia now legally does n't make a profit in the high-tax italian jurisdiction , while mcdonalds luxembourg pays very taxes on its totally legitimate ( tm ) made in luxembourg profits . 
  keep in mind that this is an ** extreme ** oversimplification , just to give you the idea . 
  in reality , it 's a game of cat and mouse between regulators being pressure by the public to put a stop to these schemes , and corporate lawyers come out with new ones to get around new regulation . 
   if your documentation is inaccurate , not because you 're trying to cheat the system , but because it 's the best you could do under the circumstances , do you contradict what it says on the documentation ? 
  you are writing as if these are novel problems that have never been considered before . 
  verifying an applicant 's story is a normal part of the asylum process , as is dealing with dodgy or absent documentation . 
   not to mention that , actually , a lot of people do n't know when and where they were born . 
  no , actually there are n't a lot of people that do n't know that . 
  again , it would be helpful to abandon tear-jerking but paternalistic stereotypes about how the third world works . 
  they are not savages living in a state of ignorance : people know the name of their village , the names and family names of their parents and other similar things in the vast , vast majority of cases . 
  they are turned over to immigration authorities . 
  or should . 
  the reality is that ngos play loose with the rules , and quite a few have an open borders mentality that sees immigration authorities as the enemy . 
   i 'm sick of this , i 'm sick of the ultra left ngo 's that are picking them up 20 miles of the libyan coastline and shuttling them hundreds of miles to italy . 
  i 've been a bit repetitive through this thread but there are so many comments where this is relevant : https://giphy.com/gifs/l3vr2he3ofe19bajg, 
  nah , i do n't like renzi and i think he 's been limp-wristed on immigration , but i do n't believe he actively partook . 
  the problem is that no one wants to make a tough choice on ngos pulling shit like this : https://giphy.com/gifs/l3vr2he3ofe19bajg, 
   we are seeing the birth of a new major smuggling channel . 
  not to rain on anyone 's picnick but people smuggling via libya has been a major channel since gaddafi was ousted . 
  it never drew as much attention because it did not reach the peaks of the balkan route , although it killed far more people in drownings . 
  and when they call it `` ferry service '' , it 's not an exaggeration : https://giphy.com/gifs/l3vr2he3ofe19bajg, 
   legitimate documentation can be pretty hard to come by in oppressive regimes/war zones . 
  if you are n't accepting refugees with dubious documentation shieldare said nothing of the sort though , he specifically said that ** lying ** should be punishable . 
  let 's not infantilize migrants to the point where we pretend they wo n't know where they come from without a piece of paper to remind them . 
   i do n't own the boat he said , translating , `` i do n't have a bot , i had one , i sold it '' , he did n't say `` the boat '' . 
  sorry but you 're just not translating this correctly . 
  `` la barca '' would be literally `` the boat '' , but the expression `` avere la barca '' means to generally own a boat , not to own a specific boat ( much like `` avere la villa '' or `` avere la moto '' means to own a villa or a bike , not a specific villa or bike ) . 
  if someone says `` you owned a yacht , you hypocrite '' and you 're trying to set the record straight on that rumor , why would n't you ... set the record straight ? 
  he had a boat , he sold it . 
  in fact that entire post is about dispelling these kinds of rumors . 
  he starts by saying `` i 'm tired of having to explain myself , so here are a few things about me '' . 
  considering he 's from genua , and more generally from liguria , that he owned a boat is not exactly surprising . 
  my father owned a boat and i do n't think he ever set foot on a yacht . 
  he owned a ferrari in the 80s , in which he very infamously killed some people ( which is why he refuses to stand for office himself ) . 
  the yatch thing refers to a when he was spotted last year on a yacht , which some tabloids alleged was his ( it was n't ) . 
  i do n't know if he owned one in the past , ca n't really find any italian sources on it . 
  it 's not a bad article , but it wades too much into the muck ( the yacht and ferrari thing are both false , for example ) and misses some key things . 
  casaleggio 's role is really , really understated . 
  casaleggio is the one who transformed the confused but charismatic ramblings of grillo into a consensus-building machine . 
  he 's the one who gave the party its grounding in e-democracy and created the veritable war machine of its web presence . 
  casaleggio is also the one who had the ruthlesness necessary to keep the party together during the tumultuous first years of having real power , when inevitably the idealism of the first hour clashed with the pressures of real-world politics . 
  the performance of the m5s is , imho , judged rather myopically . 
  they have a list of failings a mile long , that 's true . 
  but most of those are due to them not being an established party , rather a group of idealists that were upjumped from obscurity to major city administrations and a large parliamentary presence almost overnight . 
  they suffered an attrition rate of 25 % , which i actually think is a rather admirable result in those circumstances . 
  [ mrw americans ca n't handle dark humor ] ( https://media0.giphy.com/media/rx3vhj311hkle/200_s.gif ), 
  of course mr. shekelstein , just step into this air-tight waiting room , do n't mind the vents ... 
  it was a jew joke , of course it was cheap . 
  oh will you ? 
  and what happens when i drop ( shows closed fist ) these ( rattles coins ) shekels ? 
  that 's just what a jew would say !, 
  oy vey why do jews always want to preach about the history of fascism ? 
  we get it !, 
  i 'm disappointed in my country , we should be doing better than this , especially in regards to jews . 
  i mean , just 24 % ? 
  mussolini would be so disappointed . 
   what 's with greece and jewish people ? 
  greeks feel screwed over by banks ? 
   those of being struck by a lightning in your lifetime ( around 10,000 no , 1 in 10,000 do not get struck by lightning in their lifetime . 
  that 's just plain retarded . 
  wikipedia lists it as 1 in 960,000 . 
  for context :  however it also found that 31 % believed the us government was behind the 9/11 terror attacks with a further 7 % blaming the jews and only 4 % saying al-qaida was responsible . 
  yep . 
  apparently , only 4-fucking-percent of british muslims think aq did 9/11 . 
  everyone wants * their * reform and changes , and from that it does n't follow that they should support just any reform or change that a government wants to make . 
   could really make our economy better we 've been making people easier to fire since 1995 , has that worked yet ? 
  also , you just agreed with me that looking at gdp is a sensible metric when it comes to judging the results of labour market reforms . 
   we were obviously overprotective in the past years . 
  that 's not obvious at all . 
   being more flexible ( more easily fired , ** more easily hired ** ) it 's always been very easy to hire people . 
  the problem is that there is n't enough demand to justify hiring enough workers . 
  and that 's not solved by making people easier to fire . 
   `` my experience of government finishes here , '' mr renzi told a press conference that will be true when , if he resigns as secretary of the democratic party . 
  as it is , he has stepped down from the premiership only . 
  that means the mess will be someone else 's to sort , while he retains control of the party and thus the majority in one house of parliament , making him the kingmaker for the next government . 
  considering the complete lack of self-criticism in his resignation speech , and considering renzi 's boundless arrogance , i have a lingering suspicion he thinks his only problem was one of marketing , and that in due time he can engineer a comeback . 
   the outcome energised the anti-immigrant northern league party , an ally of french far-right leader marine le pen . 
  the nl coalition is the weakest one in all polls . 
  it 's the m5s that might have a shot at the next general election , yet the international press seems obsessed with seeing a rising far-right behind every event . 
   the risk of political instability in italy , europe 's fourth largest economy , led to stocks and the euro falling in early trading in asia . 
  the euro fell to a 20-month low against the dollar at $ 1.0505 in after opening at around $ 1.0685 , but later pulled back up to $ 1.0562 . 
  both statements already belied by market returning to trend , which is fairly obvious given that a ` no ' victory had been expected for months . 
  but leave it to the telegraph to spell doom for europe , and write things like :  analysts : this could be first step of italy 's exit from eurozone they even had to massage their analysts ' opinions , because what they actually said is :  holger schmieding , at the berenberg private bank , said the risk that italy could choose to leave the euro , ** while still remote ** , had increased . 
   we 're not talking about gdp here .
