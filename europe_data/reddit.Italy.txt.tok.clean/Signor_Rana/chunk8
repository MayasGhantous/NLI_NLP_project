   he also wants to take some of the senate 's power and give the final say on a range of ordinary issues to the second chamber correct : the senate would only have significant powers over constitutional and electoral laws , as well as laws modifying the relationship between state and regions , as well as on the election of certain officials . 
  it would also no longer vote for confidence in the government , which is probably the biggest single change . 
   the fear here is that this could lead to early elections and the five star movement ( a populist eurosceptic movement ) could come to power and trigger another brexit . 
  the m5s is not for leaving the eu , they barely if ever back their own proposal of a referendum on the euro , and they ca n't have it anyway because it 's unconstitutional to have referenda on international treaties . 
  polls close at 23 , after a few minutes we 'll get exit polls , then at least an hour to get a general picture , detailed results will take more . 
  by tomorrow morning the count will be almost completely if not entirely over , we are generally quick . 
  it is about far more than that , but he introduced that line of reasoning himself by pledging to resign should he lose . 
  he did that when he was ahead in the polls and thought his popularity would help the reform . 
  he has since tried to back down . 
   until now , both houses of the italian parliament need to approve every piece of legislation , making the process of lawmaking lenghty , complicated and expensive . 
  can we please not introduce yes talking points into the explanatory text ? 
  the lawmaking process is as quick as the european average , far more productive , and not particularly expensive at all ( the projected savings with the reform are $ 57 million , all due to the lowering of the total number of senators ) . 
   the proposal also includes a change to the electoral system , giving the party that wins the most votes in the election for the lower house a large number of additional seats in order to strengthen governments . 
  absolutely not , this is just wrong . 
  we vote on the constitutional reform , not on the electoral law . 
  please remove this . 
   the problem is that since the beginning of the crisis greece had a large brain drain that increased the problem of low productivity . 
  yes , my question is whether that is ** the ** problem or just ** a ** problem among many others relating to productivity . 
  renzi has set up his referendum campaign on the basis of the following ideas : - vote yes , because otherwise italy will remain stuck in the past - vote yes so that we stop paying so many useless politicians - vote yes because otherwise the financial markets will punish us - vote yes because otherwise you get grillo or salvini these are simplistic , mostly fear-based arguments . 
  this is populism , like it or not . 
  your side is not the only one entitled to swing the `` populist ! '', 
  rhetorical baton around . 
   many will vote no because a yes vote will allow their government to strip powers from the special/devolved regions such as friuli or sicily . 
  they are specifically excluded , so no . 
  i see . 
  yes he 's indeed the only italian leader capable of opposing pro-establishment populism to the anti-establishment variety , that 's very true . 
   this referendum will affect italian politics for a very long time  you keep on denying it '' ** we are choosing which constitution will govern us for the next several decades . 
  ** some of us see choosing well in that respect as a greater priority over possibly nudging this or that party closer to government in the next election . 
  you are free to pick different priorities of course , but do n't pretend you know what 's in the heart of all or most no voters . '', 
  i 'm getting tired of making complex multi-line comments and be replied-to with misrepresentations and strawmen . 
   the city centre 's also a theme park for tourists so no wonder you did n't see anything referendum-related , let alone actual romans ... username checks out . 
  schools and a few other public buildings . 
  our polling stations usually contain a lot of actual booths and are provided in a very large number , so queues that would be visible from the outside are so rare i ca n't remember ever seeing one . 
  it is in general a very well organized system . 
   renzi is the only italian politician capable of swimming against the tide of history that is an ... interesting statement to say the least . 
  renzi himself would say that he 's the leader to finally make italy go * with * the tide of history , dislodging it from its supposed immobilism . 
  in fact he built most of his political persona over the idea that he 's the `` rottamatore '' , the one who will finally force old politics into retirement and push italy into the future . 
   my priority should be the same as yours : living in a prosperous country . 
  this is a platitude . 
  the entire point of discussion is how to reach this objective , which means which other or sub-priorities we have . 
   you 're free to vote `` no '' for whatever reason you like , but do n't pretend that most people will vote based on their leader 's campaign . 
  but this is exactly what i 've been saying : most people will vote based on their evaluation of the reform rather than simply following a party line . 
   you 're telling me to argue against your argument regarding m5s , but you do n't have an argument . 
  you 're just dodging the whole point of why i think it 's wrong to vote `` no '' : the consequences of the vote . 
  i 'm dodging nothing , i 've explained quite clearly a ) why i think the immediate political consequences of this vote are not a primary consideration and b ) why i do n't believe m5s ' electoral fortunes are particularly tied to this referendum . 
   regarding your last point , i 'm not voting on the basis of which party i prefer : i 'm voting on the basis of which country i prefer . 
  nice slogan , but a ) that 's true of people on both sides of the debate and b ) you 're the one that brought up the next elections and which party is likely to win , not i.

  the secondary source is page 26 of this [ pdf ] ( https://media.wix.com/ugd/14a30c_40e29a7edc7a4bea8394cd59c42f6371.pdf ) . 
  the primary source is data from our chamber of deputies , not cited further and probably provided by its internal research service . 
  it 's an interesting angle , two items though : - was greece 's productivity high before this loss of workers ? 
  i 'm inclined to doubt it - is that the only reason for greece 's low productivity ? 
  for example , a quick look at world bank data tells me that greek r&d spending is very low for a european country , which i suspect is part of the problem, 
   there is no bottleneck in terms of government stability ? 
  ` bottleneck ' refers to a constricting passage that slows the flow of something , and in general a singular point in a system which reduces its performance , so forgive me if i did n't take your meaning . 
   i believe quite a few italian governments bit the dust in the senate ( including prodi 's government ) that legislature was elected under the calderoli electoral law . 
  that law is better known in italy by the name of `` porcellum '' ; the suffix - um is a habit of our political culture ( not unlike the - gate for scandals in english ) , whereas the `` porcell - '' part comes from `` porcello '' , a diminutive of `` porco '' , or pig . 
  in italian , `` porcata '' means `` something a pig does '' , which means something ill-made or made with devious intent . 
  the electoral law gained that name because its author , senator calderoli , went on television and happily declared it a `` porcata '' that he had designed to make the next parliament ingovernable : it was meant to create radically different majorities in the two houses of parliament . 
  this is because calderoli 's coalition expected to lose those elections and it wanted to poison the well for the incoming center-left executive . 
  ( edit : and a big chunk of that law was later ruled unconstitutional by our court )  stability is what italy needs definitely not . 
  we have had both strong and weak governments , governments that lasted long and governments that last far shorter , and i 'd challenge anyone to show a trend that stronger longer-lasting governments produced better results on average . 
  they certainly produced more laws and more initiatives ; more is not , though , in any way equal to better . 
   i almost do n't dare to ask about it to prevent coming over as pedantic , but could you source this ? 
  i can source it in italian if you like . 
   the italian system where the senate is at least as powerful as the lower house is quite exceptional and i wonder whether the bottleneck it creates let me stop you right there . 
  the italian parliament has passed more laws in the last 20 years than the legislatures of france , germany , the uk or spain . 
  the vast majority of laws only have a reading in the chamber and one in the senate . 
  there is no great need to make it more productive , nor really any bottleneck . 
   voters do n't only decide on the constitutional reform . 
  they also decide on which country they want to live for the next few years we are choosing which constitution will govern us for the next several decades . 
  some of us see choosing well in that respect as a greater priority over possibly nudging this or that party closer to government in the next election . 
  you are free to pick different priorities of course , but do n't pretend you know what 's in the heart of all or most no voters . 
   and a country where `` no '' wins is a country that , ** whether you like it or not ** , will make a m5s government much more likely i 'd appreciate it if you could stop arguing on the basis of `` you only believe what you believe for emotional/irrational reasons '' . 
  i explained in plain language what i think of the likelihood of an m5s government and it has nothing to do with whether i 'd like one . 
  you are free to argue against my argument , but argue against ** it ** , not something else . 
   voting responsibly means also taking into account the consequences of your vote . 
  i return the same consideration to you . 
  is it truly `` responsible '' to vote on a large constitutional reform on the basis of which party it is likely to help in the very next election , given that this constitution will govern us for many more elections to come , elections in which we will not just have a repetition of the current political situation ? 
   a debt write off wo n't magically fix that unemployment , you know . 
  a debt write off is far more likely to help with unemployment than stripping workers of rights and bargaining power . 
  the improvement in investment due to being able to hire dirt-cheap workers will be more than offset by the fall in aggregate demand due to those dirt-cheap wages . 
  this is a mechanism that we 've seen in my own country . 
  advanced economies can not become competitive by lowering cost of labour , purely because we are just not poor enough : developing countries can provide costs of labour that are far below subsistence levels for our workers . 
  the only outs are either leveraging unique points of strength , like local historical heritage , or invest heavily in innovation . 
  raising productivity by worsening worker rights and compensation is a terrible idea though . 
  greece wo n't become competitive with low cost of labour countries any time soon , there will always be a china or a vietnam or some other developing country far ahead of them in that respect . 
   this is true though . 
  no , it 's not . 
  voters decide on the constitutional reform , not on whether they want to recall renzi 's government . 
  i like neither salvini nor grillo and i 'm still voting no , based on the content of the reform . 
   and it is also true that if `` no '' wins a m5s government will be very likely , sooner or later . 
  m5s has been polling ahead of pd for months before this vote . 
  an m5s government is likely or unlikely purely as a political question , that is more italians support them than anyone else . 
  and that 's due to true and perceived failures of the establishment far more than anything else . 
   he himself is the most popular politician in the country . 
  yes , and like i said that does n't tell the whole picture because pd is currently the only ~ ~ party ~ ~ sorry , only coalition which relies on a single frontman . 
  are n't we going in circles ? 
  the way i see it , a decision for yes or no hangs in the balance of whether you want an institutional system that is geared more towards representation ( i.e. 
  making sure that government action has democratic legitimacy ) or one that is geared more towards efficacy ( i.e.
