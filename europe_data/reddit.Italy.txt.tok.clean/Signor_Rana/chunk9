  making sure that whoever is in power has the means to enact their will , not necessarily with the support of most of the population ) . 
  personally i think we 're going into an age of increasing degradation of democratic institutions , where pressures other than the will of the people are likely to sway government action even against said will of the people ( something which my country has seen plenty of during the last few years ) . 
  i definitely , definitely do n't want a constitution that makes it easier for the government to steamroll over both parliament and local communities , and especially not one that lends itself to majority rule electoral systems of any kind ( like the electoral law that has passed together with the constitutional reform ) . 
   ti be honest it is extremely common for the incumbent party to poll behind opposition parties . 
  of course , i was simply pointing out that your statement concerning renzi 's popularity did n't tell the whole story . 
  have you tried reading the article in the op ? 
  this is the subtitle :  voters to decide between the political establishment ** and rising populist forces ** in referendum that could see renzi resign like i ** just ** said , i 'd like it if we could talk about this without resorting to automatic thinking and assuming that our position is obviously correct and unassailable and anyone who disagrees is obviously stupid , wicked and peddling bullshit . 
  thank you . 
  also : beside the economist , which foreign publications endorsed the no ? 
  more important to my argument , which had little to do with official endorsements , how much coverage followed this article 's template of casting the vote as renzi vs populism ? 
  here are a few samples : http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/world/europe/italy-referendum-matteo-renzi.html http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38155968 http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/italian-referendum-seen-as-populisms-next-big-test-with-worrying-implications-for-eu/article33122088/ https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/27/matteo-renzi-politics-italy-european-union-brexit-trump http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/italy-approaches-its-own-choice-between-liberalism-and-populism, 
   he 's still more popular than any other political leader . 
  does n't mean much when renzi 's main opponent is a party led by three different people . 
  the m5s currently polls ahead of renzi in both a first and second turn vote . 
  i only wish that this would n't be painted by so much foreign media as a vote where there 's some kind of obviously good , smart , correct choice that might only lose because the unwashed masses are swayed by populism . 
  this is just automatic thinking , recycling narratives from the brexit referendum or trump 's election for a vote whose only similarity to those is that it happens during the same year . 
  can we stop decrying anyone we disagree with as obviously wrong and plainly unreasonable ? 
  there are perfectly sensible reasons to vote no , thank you very much . 
  hell most yes voters will admit to as much . 
  maybe learn something about the reform before reasoning on the referendum via automatic thinking ? 
  it 's nothing of the sort . 
   98 % of afghans between 18 and 39 are rejected and will be deported . 
  as they should . 
  international asylum is for people who are unable to avail themselves of the protection of their birth country , and while there are areas of afghanistan which are dangerous , there are also plenty of areas that are n't . 
  afghanis should flee to those , not to a place halfway around the world that just so happens to be fantastic should your objective be economic immigration . 
  because they believe that the european union actually is weakening european countries . 
  at least in its current form . 
   i just pointed out that it is indeed possible to be `` racist against a culture '' it 's possible to form the sentence `` racist against a culture '' , that it makes sense to do so is something that you have yet to show . 
   what is immigration ? 
  something that people oppose for , among other reasons , what / u/the-great-swiss pointed out . 
   those unsourced data the data is from [ this wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_the_united_kingdom#demographics ) , which takes the numbers from academic sources . 
  so disliking negative aspects of other cultures is automatically racist and therefore impermissible ? 
  this is a thought-terminating clich\u00e9 , the end of intelligent discourse . 
  we ca n't be capable of criticizing our culture exclusively , while somehow infantilizing others as incapable of doing wrong . 
   you talk about white identity and ca n't fathom that there are differences within a culture i 'm yet to meet a nationalist that thinks his country is culturally uniform with no differences whatsoever . 
  what nationalists usually point out is that while there are definitely many variations in their nation 's culture , they 're still far closer to each other than to cultures of non-european immigrants . 
   his is not what the nationalists want , they want isolationism , division and weakness in europe . 
  that 's your imagined strawman , and nationalists would say that multiculturalism and mass immigration are terrific sources of division and weakness . 
  here you can find a collection of surreptitiously published polls : http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2016/12/01/referendum-sondaggi-da-conclavi-e-ippodromi-lassemblage-o-san-norberto-davanti-ma-non-sicuro-di-vincere/3230292/ tl ; dr poll n. 1 has `` no '' in the lead by 6 points poll n. 2 has `` no '' in the lead by 4 to 8 points poll n. 3 has `` no '' in the lead by 6 points so i think it 's fair to say that pre-election polls have `` no '' in the lead by 6 points . 
  however the last full polls i saw had a large percentage of undecided voters , so it 's mathematically very possible for `` yes '' to win . 
   i was expecting valdid criticism  i bet if you demolished those medieval buildings and built more modern looking cities/towns , you would not have so much problems with unemployment . 
  we too . 
  added !, 
  added !, 
  added !, 
  you are factually wrong on each of those points . 
  i do n't know what to tell you besides to read the sources i provided and do some extra research . 
  i 've read through the entire article , and for something that purports to explain `` why so many muslim women find it hard to integrate in britain '' , and especially for something that cites an upcoming government report , it 's too light in data for my taste . 
  the only integration-related data they cite is occupational statistics for muslim women , which are given without context , analysis or explanation . 
  i did not come away from this feeling like i have a better idea of what 's going on than before . 
  we also had them in the form of fake horse races , for elections . 
  for example , forza italy ( berlusconi 's party ) would be called `` the stallion of arcore '' , arcore being where berlusconi has his famous mega-villa . 
  the whole problem with that mechanism is that it makes it even easier to shield corrupt people from prosecution . 
  you do n't even need to get them elected as senators in a national election , just get them a spot as regional councillor ( much easier ) and then push them up to the senate . 
  but you know , that 's not my biggest gripe . 
  my biggest gripe with the new senate is that the senators will have two jobs : senator , and then either mayor or regional councillor . 
  how can you remotely do both of those well ? 
  one will be sacrificed to the other . 
  what 's the advantage of this system ? 
  none that i can see . 
   the economist keeps confusing the electoral law with the constitutional reform the two are inextricably tied together : if the constitutional reform passes then the electoral law comes into effect , if the reform fails then the electoral law is automatically invalidated by its own stipulations . 
  it 's no kind of confusion , they are exactly right in linking them . 
   senators have no immunity from prosecution . 
  no , you are completely wrong here . 
  [ even the yes campaign 's own website ] ( http://www.bastaunsi.it/immunita-parlamentare-referendum-costituzionale/ ) admits senators will have parliamentary immunity . 
   in fact , the legislative power is in the hands of the government that uses `` emergency decrees '' to pass laws `` emergency decrees '' is a horrible translation that evokes the idea of `` emergency powers '' , extra-legal procedures and other undemocratic means . 
  what you are talking about are `` law-decrees '' , something akin to the us executive orders . 
  they are government orders , having the force of law , which come into effect for 60 days and must then be confirmed , amended or repealed by parliament . 
  in practice , they are a way for the government to force parliament to vote quickly on governmental legislation . 
  i do n't understand how the yes campaign can pretend to be scandalized at this : their reform would introduce a law-making procedure whereby the government can introduce a bill and then force parliament to vote on it in ... 60 days . 
  the reform also does not abolish law-decrees , and writes into the constitution the same limitations on their use that had already been established by the constitutional court , so in essence it does n't restrict them in any new way . 
  voting against a resolution to start a eu propaganda effort means you 're pro-russian now ? 
  this is embarassing and pathetic , and reeks of `` everyone who does n't fall in line is a traitor '' mentality . 
  one can oppose russia 's hegemonic pretences over eastern europe and still think a eu propaganda arm is not something we should have . 
  this polarization of `` you either vote along these lines or a you 're a russian fifth column '' is taking on some very worrying undertones . 
   you can support russia then as much as you like ? 
  i mostly oppose russia because i think its government has a predatory mindset regarding eastern europe . 
  at the same time i do n't like the eu parliament openly building itself a propaganda arm , no matter whether its stated aim is to counter russian disinformation . 
  i do n't trust them not to turn it against political enemies - say , european parties that most meps do n't like . 
  it 's not something a democratic body should have . 
  does that make me a friend of russia ? 
  the problem is not just unemployment , it 's loss of productive capacity in a strategic sector . 
  going into the 21st century with china owning our steel supply is simply dumb . 
  they 're not our friends and we should n't assume that our current ok relations will last indefinitely . 
  `` my friend '' is just an expression , chill . 
  for someone who keeps resorting to calling others emotional and saying that their arguments are just to `` make them feel better '' you 're getting quite irate yourself . 
  let 's stop here . 
  i 'm stating facts as well . 
  what is `` emotional '' about calling out label-reasoning for what it is ? 
  you 're assigning labels to unknown actors whose arrival you tell us we must fear , pre-emptively dismissing anything they might say because they belong to the enemy label-group . 
  * that * is emotional reasoning my friend . 
  your use of `` offended '' to dismiss my argument as an emotional complaint is also a propaganda technique . 
   post-truth  putin bots you 're using labels in place of reasoning to create a moloch of an enemy against which you urge us to rally . 
  this is propaganda my friend . 
  but that 's what i said , scotland is called `` country '' in the context of internal british politics . 
  that 's fine , they should keep doing it if it makes them happy . 
  i 'll call them `` country '' when they become one . 
   would you call yourself a tier 1 subdivision of the eu ? 
  i 'm pretty sure there 's an italian embassy in the uk . 
  probably a consulate in scotland to be honest .
