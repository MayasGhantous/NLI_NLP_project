  ( france ), 
  yeah , it 's a shame that an european country ca n't sell weapons to someone that could use them against europe . 
  c'mon , do n't be so surprised , my friend ... 
  ... even without an actual attack . 
  among italian ones , `` pane e tulipani '', 
  i was going to hope `` rolan barbaren '', 
  what 's their alternative ? 
  journalism paid by big companies ? 
  ca n't see how this could go wrong . 
  i 'm worried . 
  lol that made my day, 
  . . for scale . 
   pro-putin bikers turned back at polish border they are actually officially supported both by kremlin and ortodox church, 
  expressing friendhsip and respect for some people 's dream ~ ~ of their private fiscal paradise ~ ~ . 
  [ do n't go in france .

   with people who are not traitors . 
  fix 'd, 
  hey , they declared independent , so it 's not our problem anymore . 
  ( i 'm just trolling , of course . ), 
  well , maybe if america would n't have spread war and poverty around the world to have access to resources and oil , people would n't have to flee their countries at all ... 
  they are so slow and uneffective that it 's like they are not available at all . 
  that 's why people choose boats . 
  this will escalate to children going at school with arquebuses . 
  or we could shoot them as they land . 
  in this way , 0 deaths in the sea . 
  ( yeah , i 'm being sarcastic . ), 
  italy is ready to trade them with the 20000 that came in the last week . 
  democracy works only with correct and precise informations given to the people . 
  otherwise , you are right . 
  and if some people claims that 9/11 never happened ? 
  seriously , i 'm tired of giving each `` opinion '' the same dignity . 
  if you say something , i will give it weight and value in proportions of your motivations , explanations , and intelligence . 
  postulating that it 's ok to throw people from a boat lacks all of them , imho . 
  ehm , off board . 
  sometimes there is actually only one acceptable opinion . 
   for arguments sake , how different would your ( i do n't mean the mods ) reaction be if it were christians throwing muslims overboard ? 
  exactly the same . 
  even if atheists threw both on board . 
  in the boat , it was . 
  i have a better idea : we do what you say , then fish the dead bodies and let them rot in front of your house . 
  you have no problem with that , i suppose ... or dead people smell less if they are far from your home ? 
  you know what 's not evil ? 
  accepting 6k migrants . 
  the problem is that even if you tattoo a number on their arm , they just wo n't care anyway . 
  if caught they ca n't be sent home , and ca n't be kept in jail for long , so they just do n't care . 
  already done , completely useless . 
  if they want to commit crime , they will anyway . 
  papers get lost in 2 seconds , or , worse , are sold . 
  probably it already has one, 
  what kind of measure are you suggesting ? 
  asking their names ? 
  getting fingerprints ?

  italy : usually no one gives a fuck , but some are socially stigmatized, 
  are these the guys we are going to let enter europe ? 
   british food is delicious just no . 
  i disagree with most of the following . 
  italian thinks that : - french are gay - germans are without feelings - spanish are quick to anger and lazy - greeks are good people - all eastern europeans are alcoholics and criminals ( thanks , right winged press ) - swiss are rich nazi - scandinavians are all the same : tall blond alcoholic vikings nothing particular about other countries . 
  brb , selling fake work contracts for 150 $ in belarus . 
  they wont close plants . 
  china buy the stuff , gets the technology , move it to china to its national factories , then rule pirelli out of the market . 
  lol , i did n't know that, 
  i 'll need an explanation for this joke , please . 
  y u no come here ? 
  spoiler : not poisonous, 
  both . 
  if you are moss . 
  spain . 
  i would be missing the sunny weather , relaxed colture and economical problems . 
  sad but true . 
  as / u/mike _ freyrie and / u/terenzio _ collina said , they are oportunistic parasites that delve where the state is n't strong enough , but before that it 's a cultural problem . 
   it 's all fun and games until someone gets transformed into jam . 
  ftfy, 
  not phallic at all . 
  sadly , yes,

  rip 'd . 
   my dog that sounds like balkan ska , not roma music ... 
  that 's a big mistake . 
  hitler was not an individual . 
  hitler was the apex of a cultural movement , of collective will , fear and hate . 
  it 's to easy to say that hitler was evil : it helps us to control the fear , the idea that anyone of us , inside , has the same evil intangible side , that is too scared to come out . 
  `` she '' as `` i do n't care about the gender so i used she as a form of respect '' . 
  some halberiers . 
  well , technically she 's right , the origins have a lot in common . 
  charles darwin is now sad . 
   the thing is that you do n't go to jail just for being lame .

  leave vodka spiced with rat poison in the streets . 
  if his res label has a reason , i 'd say the second one . 
  not bad . 
  10 % is still not a majority , or a significant sample . 
  that kind of questions can still be biased : `` do you judge your food as very variant ? '', 
  ( yes/no ) -  10 % no -  food is boring . 
  `` did you have sex lately ? '', 
  ( yes/no ) -  10 % no -  no sex if you want to massage data it 's very , very easy to do it . 
   apparently times have changed .
