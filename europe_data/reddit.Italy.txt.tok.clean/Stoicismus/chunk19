  if anything , they actually uphold the laws . 
  lmao bullshit sources . 
  pravdareport ... by the way http://tg.la7.it/cronaca/zuccaro-su-ong-indagini-provano-interessi-delle-mafie-per-soldi-accoglienza-09-05-2017-115711 the ngo hypotesis was just that , an hypotesis . 
  he pretty much retracted everything he had said . 
  but local mafia ( in b4 mafia funded by soros ) was found culprit of exploiting the situation . 
  everyone is a descendant of people that at some point of history got murdered by neighbor countries . 
  that 's like claiming that europeans should n't be allowed in israel because of ww2 . 
  arabs imported the drying process , which is what ultimately made paste a popular dish . 
  but pasta itself already existed prior to that . 
  what has to do xenophobia with success . 
  their moneys do not come from that . 
  flashmobs music videos are the cringiest stuff ever . 
  turning beethoven 's music into a joke . 
  not even comparable . 
  in one case you get punished for what you are , in the other for what you 've become . 
  just like by modern laws you get punished for ** committing ** a crime , not for being black or brown . 
  how can you have democracy when billionaires can buy politicians ? 
  classical greece flowered due to people not having any working purpose in life , so they could do philosophy and arts . 
  this one too https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donation_of_constantine, 
  yes we should force people to behave good for the good of society as a whole . 
  that includes paying taxes for stuff they may not even make use of in their entire life . 
  no , private charity does n't have the same influence as state organized fundings . 
  they better do n't read their bible then . 
  because in acts the early church is portraied as a communist community where everything is shared , nothing is owned . 
  they may as well start building their own roads , and bridges . 
  muslims are not the only people on earth and in europe circumcising their children . 
  african christians do too . 
  jews do too . 
  in fact the day of circumcision of jesus ( circumcisione domini ) was still a holy day until recently ( it is the 1 of january ) . 
  besides , even many pagan gods came from the east . 
  christianity just managed to win out of dozen similar oriental cults . 
  jews have been in the roman empire since caesar at least , and palestine was roman territory . 
  after 2000 + years we ca n't really call judaism `` foreign '' , albeit being born outside mainland europe ( a modern concept anyway ) . 
  muslims lived in europe for 600 years . 
  why should they not be associated with european history ? 
   there is in fact an ongoing italian judicial report accusing ngo 's of collusion with human traffickers . 
  accusing nothing . 
  there are just some doubts regarding some smaller ngos . 
  not all of them , just some . 
  even if some ngo were actually misbehaving that would n't affect others like msf whatsoever . 
  you do n't know shit . 
  she 's like trump , she 's in touch with the people . 
  ah ye , globalism is only brown people `` invading '' white countries . 
  us dogs pissing on the rest of the world ? 
  just fine !, 
  not even 20mil poor iranian girls ? 
  every altrighter should . 
  they all suffer from insane paranoia . 
  i agree , let 's support christian traditions . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turning_the_other_cheek if you are authoritarian you are denying your very christian roots . 
  also  but every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head -- it is the same as having her head shaved . 
  6 for if a woman does not cover her head , she might as well have her hair cut off ; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved , then she should cover her head . 
  you insult yourself by posting , thereby making your arguments even less strong than what they are ( 0 , just like any other comment with the buzzword patriot ) . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/69mb5o/rle_canard_right_now/ lol, 
  classical globalist americans trying to impose their culture on others . 
  everyone can finance ngo , go to their website and make a donation . 
  of course soros is gon na finance those who share his views . 
  people are not objective . 
  notice how islam is always `` invading '' , while european empires were just , you know , bringing civilization . 
  greeks and romans conquering asia minor ? 
  fine . 
  muslims conquering asia minor ? 
  bloodthirsty religion !!, 
  exactly , there is tons of literature that developed later , but so can be said for islamic law , there is tons of literature which is only loosely based on tradition , or pretty much freely made up , which is agreed upon anyway . 
  so nothing is actually keeping islam from modernizing today , just like it did during its 1400 years of history . 
  as you seem to have knowledge of the tanakh i 'm sure you are annoyed when someone comes out ( expecially on worldnews or atheism ) with random verses from it disregarding prior and later developments . 
  if we can accept a book where women are sold like cattles and stoning is a valid punishment ( tanakh ) why ca n't we accept another one which is just the same ( quran ) ? 
  besides , the first 5 scrolls are supposedly written by moses `` himself '' , try changing the text and tell me a hoarde of orthodox jews are n't going to be very upset at you . 
  first quote has nothing to do with apostasy . 
  it 's about war . 
  this is normal stuff that happens even today in the western world in war times , if you switch side be ready to be bombed by your former allies . 
  all the others are from later hadith , so it can be found a way around with some work . 
  just like muslims always found way around every other prohibition , even those straight from the quran . 
  also , lol if you think muslims actually read hadith books . 
  that 's like thinking that christians read the early church fathers . 
  islamic interpretation changed for centuries . 
  in fact the islamic legal tradition is absolutely gigantic , they also have different school of thoughts working side by side . 
  you do n't need to change the text to change the meaning . 
  see christianity , they built a new religion by re-interpreting the jewish bible . 
  in the qur ` an no phisical penalty is given for apostasy , it is god 's matter . 
  death penalty for apostasy come from a later hadith and was developed during the civil wars , where changing religions basically meant switching political side , aka treason . 
  in the western world treason is a punishable crime as well , until very recently with death . 
  whatever it is , this means that the tradition could possibly be changed expecially because some passages in the qur ` an could support that . 
  so not saying it is easy , not dismissing the problem , but i think that we could help islam to undergo specific reforms . 
  after all the fact that the qur ` an is so tied to historical events could be used to restrict general views to very specifical situations . 
  please respect our european culture and use proper european words , liberal in europe does n't mean what it does in the usa . 
  dude , it 's all shit and trash produced by the ** african ** - ~ ~ americans ~ ~ . 
  ca n't even spot a white man in the picture !, 
  this is proof the ethnical war is real !, 
  they are part of mediterranean europe and occupy the lands of the former eastern roman empire . 
  also the cradle of christianity . 
  part of their modern nation and population is geographically and culturally european . 
  just because they now speak turkish does n't mean we have nothing to do with them anymore . 
  if it was done to another country trying to re-establish the death penalty we would be calling for the end of democracy . 
  ayy even modern science is a soros led conspiracy now . 
  spanish ? 
  relativist ? 
  should we also accept islamist propaganda then ? 
   arcadia well , it 's the land of pan after all . 
  it does n't matter if it helps human traffickers .
