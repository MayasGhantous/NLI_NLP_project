  `` all studies '' are not definitive . 
  many american studies pointed out , in the racist past , that blacks where more prone to violence and less mentally developed . 
  turns out the problem where not the data themselves but how they were obtained and used . 
  ** warfare and the norms of islam ** the earliest compendia of scholarly opinions related to the rules of war seem to be those associated with the iraqi jurists who styled themselves as working in the tradition of abu hanifa ( d. 767 ) . 
  a collection of opinions related to jihad and jizya ( i.e. , to questions about military affairs and taxation in the regions that came under muslim rule during the postprophetic expansion ) is associated with the work of abu yusuf ( d. 798 ) . 
  even more significant is the collection associated with muhammad b. al-hasan al-shaybani ( d. 804 ) , which later generations knew by the title kitab al-siyar , or the `` book of movements . '' as the contents indicate , the movements in question are those between the territory in which islam is established ( d\u0101r al-isl\u0101m ) and the territory where it is not ( d\u0101r al-\u1e25arb ) . 
  as the arabic suggests , the latter is , under certain conditions , the object of war intended to expand the dominion of islam . 
  given this interest , the text is preoccupied with the rules of engagement for muslim forces : how they should approach the foe , what targets and tactics are appropriate , what is to be done with enemy persons , and how war prizes are to be distributed or managed . 
  the opinions collected in the text are presented as responses to particular questions : must the muslim forces issue an invitation to the opposition so that its people have an opportunity to submit voluntarily and thus avoid war ? 
  what if the muslim forces find themselves in a situation in which they must employ tactics that will result in the death of children ? 
  are enemy captives to be killed , or must they be transported to the territory of islam ? 
  may the muslim fighters keep prizes ( horses , money , etc. ), 
  they capture , or must they place these at the disposal of their commander ? 
  in these and other cases , the text reports the opinions of abu hanifa , abu yusuf , or shaybani -- and sometimes of all three . 
  answers are crafted in consultation with verses of the qur ' an , reports of muhammad 's words and deeds , and the practice of the early muslims , but these scholars also appeal to the notion of `` that which is salutary , '' meaning ( at least in part ) `` that which works , in order for the muslim community to carry out its mission . '' here , their interest is in the ability of the muslim forces to attain victory . 
  thus , when faced with questions regarding tactics that will result in the death of children , the responses grant considerable latitude in the interests of the muslims ' ability to carry out their mission . 
  looking at the text as a whole , we may reconstruct the argument as follows : 1 . 
  the prophet forbade the killing of children ( along with a number of other categories of persons whose noninvolvement in fighting classifies them as noncombatants ) . 
  there are cases in which muslim armies must employ tactics that would result in the death of children or else stop fighting . 
  these include siege warfare , in which the use of hurling machines does not allow for precise targeting , and cases in which an enemy tries to deter the muslims by tying children to the city walls , so that archers firing into the city are likely to hit at least some of the children . 
  in cases like those previously mentioned , the muslim armies should do their best to avoid harming children and other noncombatants . 
  but they can not be prohibited from doing what is necessary to win . 
  as shaybani puts it , `` if the muslims stopped attacking the inhabitants of the territory of war for any of the reasons that you have stated , they would be unable to go to war at all , for there is no city in the territory of war in which there is no one at all of these you have mentioned . '' -- from : islamic political thought : an introduction ; princeton university press ( 2015 ) so while expensionistic war may be permitted by classical islamic thought , it should still follow typical war rules . 
  the same rules that were not followed by western nations when they bombed civilians during ww2 ( let 's say it clear : usa ) . 
  forcing someone into the muslim faith is frowned upon in the quran itself . 
  punishing them is god 's duty . 
  that is still not acceptable by today 's standard . 
  but very far from modern terror-jihad . 
  -- now i ask you : why do you talk about what you clearly dont know ? 
  just to fish for karma ? 
  * jihad * * john kelsay * literally meaning `` struggle , '' jihad may be associated with almost any activity by which muslims attempt to bring personal and social life into a pattern of conformity with the guidance of god . 
  nevertheless , early in the development of islam , jihad came to be associated particularly with fighting or making war `` in the path of god . '' in thinking about jihad , then , we may learn a great deal through a focus on war . 
  muslims have written about war in a variety of genres . 
  lambton once remarked that philosophical treatises , the mirrors for princes compiled by court officials such as nizam al-mulk ( d. 1092 ) who were interested in communicating the lessons of statecraft , and the compendia of juridical opinions collected in the schools devoted to shari\u2018a reasoning constitute three distinctive and important styles of muslim political writing . 
  one could speak similarly about war . 
  for political thought , legitimation is the great issue : what form of order best coheres with the good , with practical wisdom , or with the guidance of god ? 
  and because experience indicates that establishing and maintaining political order often involves the use of military force , discussions of war ordinarily follow . 
  a comparison of world civilizations shows that questions like `` when is war justified ? '' `` who decides ? '' and `` how is war to be conducted ? '' are typically tied to notions about the purpose of politics and the distribution of power : both are related to ideas about the nature and destiny of human beings , so religion comes into the mix as well . 
  in tying religion , politics , and war together , muslims are hardly unique . 
  they continue to speak and write in the distinctive ways previously mentioned . 
  indeed , lambton 's list of three types of writing is probably too short . 
  for the fullest possible exposition of muslim thought about war , one would need to consult the treatises ( adab ) of men of letters like jahiz ( d. 868 or 869 ) or the histories compiled by tabari ( d. 923 ) and others . 
  works of fiction would have their place in such a survey , as would poetic texts . 
  nevertheless , one can speak of the relative importance of certain forms . 
  the compendia of opinions or responses to questions by experts in the practice of shari\u2018a reasoning constitute a source of inestimable importance for understanding the islamic experience of war . 
  this is true because the shari\u2018a ( i.e. , the `` path '' or way of living most conducive to human happiness in this world and the next ) suggests a focus on the questions of when , who , and how outlined earlier . 
  in addition , the practice of shari\u2018a reasoning , in the sense of a transgenerational argument about the guidance of god , goes to the heart of what it means to submit or to bring oneself and one 's world into a pattern of behavior consistent with the purposes of the creator . 
  the attempt to relate the `` sources of comprehension '' ( i.e. , the qur ' an , the sunna of the prophet , and the consensual precedents set by recognized experts ) to contemporary situations ( by means of reasoning , especially analogy ) is perhaps the most characteristic attempt to think about war in an islamic `` voice . '' as such , changes in a\u1e25k\u0101m al-jih\u0101d ( the judgments pertaining to armed struggle ) across the generations reflect the changing fortunes and political conditions of muslims , thus opening the door to wider areas of muslim experience . 
  ** foundational motifs ** in speaking about shari\u2018a discourse about war , it is useful to be aware of the following issues : ( 1 ) the story of muhammad and his companions , ( 2 ) theological ideas , and ( 3 ) accounts of the development of islam across the centuries . 
  * the story of muhammad * while the historical accuracy of traditional biographies of muhammad may be in question , the outline of the story muslims tell about the struggles of the prophet and his companions are not . 
  once the prophet began his public ministry , the primary response in mecca was resistance . 
  the small community that gathered around muhammad experienced discrimination and persecution . 
  when this rose to the level of physical abuse , some of the prophet 's companions urged retaliation . 
  according to the story told by muslims through the centuries , muhammad refused , saying that he had been given an order only to preach . 
  this was not the final word , of course . 
  sometime during the negotiations by which muhammad and his community moved to medina , god sent the verses recorded in qur ' an 22:39 -- 40 : `` ** those who have been attacked are permitted to take up arms because they have been wronged . 
  god has the power to help them ; those who have been driven unjustly from their homes only for saying ` our lord is god . ' if god did not repel some people by means of others , many monasteries , churches , synagogues , and mosques , where god 's name is much invoked , would have been destroyed ** . '' the clear import of this text is that the muslims now had different orders . 
  in medina , muhammad added the roles of military commander and statesman to his preaching in the effort to achieve security for the believers . 
  as the story continues , we understand that the `` permission '' of qur ' an 22:39 -- 40 evolves into the `` destined '' or `` ordained '' of qur ' an 2:216 ( `` warfare is a thing written for you , though you do not like it '' ) and the direct command of qur ' an 2:190 -- 94 ( `` ** fight those who are fighting you , but do not become aggressors ** '' ) . 
  in qur ' an 4:75 , god challenges the believing community : `` and why should you not fight in god 's cause and for those oppressed ... ? '' in qur ' an 8:39 , the order is to fight until god 's cause succeeds , and in chapter 9 , fighting against those who violate treaties or otherwise prove dishonorable is authorized `` wherever you find them . '' the order of the verses is given in the story so that the intensity and expansiveness of the order to fight mirror developments in the military and political struggle with unbelievers . 
  when in the end the muslims prevail , muhammad proclaims that `` arabia is solidly for islam . '' the narrative of struggle thus ends on a note of hope . 
  it also ends by reinforcing the message that runs throughout : from the muslim point of view , the question is not whether the muslims should go to war or not . 
  rather , the issue from beginning to end is obedience . 
  when the companions in mecca urge retaliation as a means of justice against mistreatment , the response is negative , not because of any direct rebuttal or refutation of their appeal , but because of god 's order . 
  similarly , when fighting is justified in connection with the migration to medina , the decisive factor is the command of god . 
  the emphasis on obedience suggests the ongoing importance of ascertaining god 's directives . 
  the development of the shari\u2018a discourse on judgments pertaining to armed struggle provides a noteworthy attempt to address this issue . 
  * the natural religion * this emphasis on obedience has its corollary in the notion that muhammad 's entire career constitutes a divine summons -- a `` calling '' of humanity to the condition signified by islam , or `` submission '' to god . 
  whether by the `` beautiful words '' of preaching or the strong persuasion of military force , the point is to bring human behavior , both personal and social , into a pattern consistent with the guidance of god . 
  in this , the story of muhammad and his companions suggests a certain view of the nature and destiny of human beings . 
  qur ' an 7:172 -- 73 describes the primordial encounter between god and humanity : `` when your lord took out the offspring from the loins of the children of adam and made them bear witness about themselves , he said : ` am i not your lord ? ' and they replied , ` yes , we bear witness . ''' the text goes on to say that the establishment of this covenant means that , on the day of the resurrection , no human being will have an excuse . 
  all are bound by the fact that human beings are creatures of god whose very purpose is to serve the divine will . 
  in accepting this -- that is , in submitting themselves to their maker -- human beings find happiness , purpose , and dignity . 
  those who reject the divine calling do harm to themselves . 
  their fights with one another mirror conflicts within themselves . 
  they suffer in this life , and if they do not make things right , they will also suffer eternal punishment in the next . 
  the point here is that nothing in muhammad 's approach to unbelievers is an imposition on or violation of their rights . 
  he is god 's messenger , calling human beings to act in accordance with their true nature and thus their best interests . 
  like other messengers before him ( most importantly , moses and jesus ) , muhammad summons people to submit to , or obey , god . 
  even the strong persuasion of war should be seen in this light , with one important proviso . 
  war may create a sphere of security for the practice of true religion . 
  it may be used to enhance such security by bringing non-muslims under the protection ( dhimma ) or `` superintendence '' of muslims . 
  ** but it should not be used to bring about faith in the sense of heartfelt acceptance of god 's service . 
  it should not because it can not -- in islam , as in other faith traditions , unwilling faith is a contradiction in term ** s . the prophet and his companions are a blessing to humanity because they call everyone to live as god intended , according to the `` natural '' religion . 
  and they give particular groups , with their individual members , as much of the blessing as possible .
