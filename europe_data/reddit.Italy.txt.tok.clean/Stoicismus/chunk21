  yeah i 'm sure those desperate people willing to risk life to migrate would just stop doing so . 
  i mean , they did n't exist before , did they ? 
  in the name of `` culture '' you can trash any human decency . 
  you should read more reddit . 
  turkey already turned into saudi v2 . 
  where do you live ? 
  gay already means happy . 
  there is a shared european culture but that does n't stop a given location to mix its culture with other non european countries . 
  there are many parts of greek culture which are closer to the mena world . 
  there are many parts of italian culture that are of arab origins ( food , words , name of locations , buildings , literature , music ) . 
  if we have to defend european culture ( from who ? 
  every book would prove them wrong ) at least let 's do it right , not buy claiming the false . 
  historically it is not even comparable , greeks have been an half middle eastern country since before the classical time ( ever heard of asia minor colonies ? 
  orientalizing period ? ) . 
  greeks have historically been part of the mediterranean culture , only recently the cultural landscape shifted northwards . 
  definitely not since `` millennia '' . 
  it is sad that you and others try to sever these ties out of some kind of shame . 
  barbarious users still defending their archaic barbarious institution . 
  sei italiano . 
  ti rendi conto la cultura italiana \u00e8 un misto di culture ? 
  i live in one of the most muslim populated cities of italy and still have to witness this invasion people on reddit talk about . 
  unless you had martel in mind , in which case `` europe '' did n't even exist back then . 
  besides , many of the current european peoples were invades . 
  no big deal . 
  muslims lived in european land for centuries . 
  christian values are n't compatible with fn values . 
  let me remind something to you  34 `` then the king will say to those on his right , ` come , you who are blessed by my father ; take your inheritance , the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world . 
  35 for i was hungry and you gave me something to eat , i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink , i was a stranger and you invited me in , 36 i needed clothes and you clothed me , i was sick and you looked after me , i was in prison and you came to visit me . '  37 `` then the righteous will answer him , ` lord , when did we see you hungry and feed you , or thirsty and give you something to drink ? 
  38 when did we see you a stranger and invite you in , or needing clothes and clothe you ? 
  39 when did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you ? '   40 `` the king will reply , ` truly i tell you , whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine , you did for me . '   41 `` then he will say to those on his left , ` depart from me , you who are cursed , into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels . 
  42 for i was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat , i was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink , 43 i was a stranger and you did not invite me in , i needed clothes and you did not clothe me , i was sick and in prison and you did not look after me . '   44 `` they also will answer , ` lord , when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison , and did not help you ? '   45 `` he will reply , ` truly i tell you , whatever you did not do for one of the least of these , you did not do for me . '   46 `` then they will go away to eternal punishment , but the righteous to eternal life . '' ------  8 `` you have heard that it was said , ` eye for eye , and tooth for tooth . ' [ h ] 39 but i tell you , do not resist an evil person . 
  if anyone slaps you on the right cheek , turn to them the other cheek also . 
  40 and if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt , hand over your coat as well . 
  41 if anyone forces you to go one mile , go with them two miles . 
  42 give to the one who asks you , and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you .

  check this link for more values which are not taken seriously by the right , when not reject altogether https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5&amp;version=niv besides , france is not a religious country . 
  that is like saying there is no point in gender equality because in the end men and women will always be different . 
  altruism is bad ? 
  they are loyal to their ideologies . 
  muslims were living in europe before some modern europeans even existed . 
  italian name but everything is german . 
  people 's republic of prato . 
  also the_d user judging by his nick . 
  culture is not a justification to be barbaric . 
  what i got from reading op 's posts in this thread : the world is going to end the moment they wont have their semis anymore . 
  2012 all over again . 
  poor souls , they may get offended . 
  which is a meaningless quote that is spammed on reddit by uneducated americans . 
  more than half of the comments are not about the genocide itself but about how shit turkey was/is , how bad turks are , how the media are hiding stuff from us , and so on . 
  because they come here spamming their shit . 
  or they post stuff like this https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/671ze8/rape_is_now_legal_in_germany_woman_is_raped_by/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=the_donald which is believed by many ( even non americans ) who in turn come here to repeat this bs . 
  to be fair , given that you said you are muslim , the sentiment is shared even by many in this sub . 
  can we do something for all t_d posters who magically start posting here every damn election day ? 
  yup , european countries have n't been sharing a common culture since the roman times . 
  but lepen is actually a fascist . 
  do you realize the distance between africa and europe ? 
  they would n't stop trying . 
   who will rape and commit crime mr. crystal ball right there . 
  far right propaganda is responsible for the rise of the far right . 
  actually magna grecia refers not to sicily but to greek colonies on land . 
  also a trouvere https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljez4oduuk4 suggest to listen to it while reading the text . 
  classical sufi thought does n't reject armed jihad . 
  does n't seem to be like this . 
  i 'm out of the loop . 
  what is this about ? 
  it makes absolutely 0 sense to judge the ancient world with modern outlook and label something asian or european . 
  another potentiallty interesting discussion turned into a / r/atheism spin-off . 
  couple a week ago a moroccan man in italy tried to force his wife to wear a burqa by force , she or someone else called the cops on it . 
  the fact is that no one in morocco wears a fucking burqa as it is banned altogether . 
  so not like he could 've developed this tradition before migrating to italy . 
  expel who and where . 
  3rd generation french-maghrebi back to their grandfathers ' lands ? 
  i know very educated persons ( graduates from university @philosophy ) who think the western media are controled by soros and other shadowy figures who are trying to destroy european civilization . 
  putin is himself a victim of them even tho he 's actually caring about us . 
  poland is not as import as the major countries targeted . 
  men of science did n't have problems supporting ethnic cleansing while blabbling about superior and inferior races during the nazi regime . 
  education is good but it 's not the ultimate enlightenment . 
  satan 's too strong !, 
  so studying and working in poland makes you polish ? 
  got any scientific reason for that or talking out of belief ? 
  women do n't need to live in a traditional society to adopt traditional roles . 
  the important thing is to give them choice , not to force them to either be free at any cost ( as if studying and being forced to work all day meant freedom ) or slaves of the men . 
  but everytime a woman expresses a positive opinion about herself enjoying the housewife life she 's depicted as a poor soul victim of the oppression . 
  a woman who needs to be helped and freed . 
  so whatever she chooses is taken as political stance by either side , in which the woman is nothing but a political tool to be used . 
  not all women want to study and be equal . 
  some actually enjoy the `` traditional '' roles . 
  ca n't dismiss this everytime by painting them as victims of propaganda , as if women did n't have a brain to think with . 
  does a moroccan even need to integrate in spain ? 
  i 'd suspect they are way more simar than turkey and north european countries . 
  this sub as a whole is quite hypocritical . 
  one day you 'll see posts drooling over `` traditions '' ( religious traditions , traditional clothes where women costantly have their head covered , and so on ) , the next you 'll see another post bashing muslims because `` these things '' do not belong to our culture . 
  what ? 
  i do n't know what to think of this . 
  but here 's a personal story : when i was a kid the teenager son of my neighbor mugged someone on the streets . 
  he was coming home , walking up the building 's stairs , feeling cool and mighty . 
  in small towns gossip spreads fast and the mom had already been told what happened , so she was waiting for him at the door . 
  as soon as he happened to be on sight she threw a slipper at him ( you know , those with very hard clog like [ this ] ( http://www.vitiellocalzature.it/foto/1018_scarpe-donna-ciabatte/ciabatta-inblu-colore-corallo-con-velcro-regolabile-zeppa-alta_3155_grande_pgd5aib00gz11co_400.jpg ) ) hitting him right in the middle of the forefront . 
  he never dared to do anything remotely as dumb ever since .
