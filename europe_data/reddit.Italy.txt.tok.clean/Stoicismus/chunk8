  you do n't know your words . 
  omnivore means you can eat everything , not that you must . 
  i 'm sure you most likely do n't eat bugs even tho you being omnivore means you could , if you wished so . 
  there are no rational position to defend meat-eating but that you do it for personal pleasure . 
  which is fine , but do n't hide between pseudo-science to feel better . 
  the conspiracy is so strong . 
  maybe jews were behind hitler too , so that in the future they could play the nazi card and expand in palestine . 
  such geniuses !, 
  history . 
  you are the product of history , giving up on your history is like killing your parents . 
  there is a mooc on this subject on edx : a global history architecture . 
  which focuses on global contacts . 
  one of the lessons is about the contacts between the greeks and the far east and how this was ref l ected in indian art and architecture . 
  worth to watch the teacher is super good . 
  - they colonized my land ( south italy ) , and i love them for that . 
  it 's the hummus . 
  explain the past 5000 years of scientific development led by religious persons whose intelligence was probably greater than the whole r/atheism put together . 
  but `` common good '' can mean everything and nothing , depends how you try to pursuit it in reality . 
  but culture changes within the same country and within different social strata . 
  so which one is the defying one ? 
  it 's very hard to pinpoint a cultural border and characterise it as unique . 
  can you provide sources for these `` many '' europeans who want islam to grow for economic reasons ? 
  why is he talking like trump ? 
  and their supporters are even proud of the growth of their countries , as if it was achieved without outside 's help . 
  yeah , how dare you not like someone who has your totally opposite views . 
  politics is just a pc game am i right ? 
  for those who likes the genre https://www.reddit.com/r/zettairyouiki/, 
  so how come this realism comes from people that could n't even point sweden on the map if asked ? 
  til : all muslims are hidden rapists . 
  r/badhistory europe would n't be islamic . 
  the homosexual lobby !, 
  why do girls cover their hairs ? 
  only because 2 things look similar does n't mean they must be related . 
  just like there are differences between a far right and a far left european . 
  the west is not a place where everyone think alike . 
  these videos are so cringe . 
  yakuza in paris ? 
  reminds me a post i 've read on here years ago where a guy would n't go into some zones because the high amount of kebab shops scared him . 
  mena in europe : when in rome do as the romans !!!!, 
  must follow our culture !!!, 
  europeans in mena : she shouldnt follow their customs shes european !, 
  she 's above them sand people !, 
  totally not racism . 
  but men are required to follow other customs , which women are exempt from . 
  it 's not like men can run around naked while women are forced to dress up from head to toe . 
  never question the police . 
  it 's not only automation , the job market is simply saturated unless you have a very sought after degree . 
  but not everyone can/want afford that . 
  but at this point you can always find someone willing to work a basic job for a slave pay . 
  `` shadow '' ? 
  more like southern italian economy . 
  does n't change the fact that the countries that bash muslims the most for being `` incompatible '' are the ones that are actually incompatible with modern western europe themselves . 
  we must absolutely defend europe 's lgbt rights from these hordes of backwards europeans . 
  extreme poverty is no better than war . 
  but it is . 
  muslims have been living in europe for centuries , before poland even was a thing . 
  and arabic was widely spoken in parts of europe . 
  this to me smells like center and north european countries thinking the only history that matters is theirs . 
  it 's my duty to defend my roots and my history . 
  expecially because i can still walk past arabic monuments . 
  so just like modern states ? 
  because the laws of my country control every aspect of society in a way or another . 
  why so ? 
  that definition of extremism is quite debatable . 
  extremism means to fulfill those 3 goals by any means , that is even by ** extreme ** force ( terrorism , war ) . 
  thinking that things were better in the mythic past is not extremist . 
  i mean , here in / r/europe every time some muslim attack happens most comments are exactly about going back to our mythic golden age european roots when everyone was living in peace and people were going to church every day and cute girls in `` traditional '' clothes played in the streets . 
  when a group of people feel excluded and threatened it is a normal reaction to cling to the mythic past and to put it above the wicked present . 
  this has been studied by anthropologists since forever . 
  often times , just like some muslims are doing now , these groups straight up make up a mythic past that never existed in the first place ( see isis ) . 
  that said 1 ) the study talks about fundamentalism , not extremism 2 ) `` fundamentalism does not necessarily include or justify violence , as this is a form of behaviour and not an ideology , '' so what 's the deal ? 
  is everyone forced to agree with progressive views of the world ? 
  also , this guy is not really credible  the specialist compares this fundamentalism with fascism and communism , other ideologies that are not synonymous with violence . 
  how is fascism not synonymous with violence ? 
  violence is the primary mean of control of fascist governments . 
  now you added too much :d, 
  the more you steal the less you get punished . 
  everything comes with a cost , even helping people . 
  wild at heart , women , your nick . 
  some people might not know but some polish porns , shot in poland , are then published through an italian label ( centoxcento ) . 
  i do n't know why they do n't publish them in their country but they are funny to watch as someone trying to learn the language . 
  i think he meant that in polish h and ch have the same sound ( = ch ) , so when poles try to spell normal h in english words they spell it ch as in polish , which is a different kind of sound . 
  i know that everyone should watch this https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/dzie%c5%84_%c5%9bwira witty , funny , intelligent . 
  and his following https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/wszyscy_jeste%c5%9bmy_chrystusami, 
  to be fair even north italians called sicilians africans and bedouins =p, 
  i 've listened yet again 2 days ago to celtic viol i and ii . 
  i cry everytime , no joke . 
  please have a look at this ensemble too , they have two discs of celtic music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6er7vqnkfku https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8t_5s2ndwq please irish and scots keep your traditions safe in your pubs !, 
  =p bit of interesting info : italian violins were popular in the british isles and many of their fiddlers studied in italy with no other than arcangelo corelli , at the time god on earth and buried in the pantheon !, 
  he 's really a limitless man . 
  he explored the following musical traditions : european medieval , renaissance , baroque , classical , celtic ( irish and scottish ) , arabic , turkish , jewish , balkans , armenian , japanese , native american/hispanic and his new release deals with the african music during the slave trade . 
  they did n't . 
  but they influenced it . 
  european music is still european music , arabic music is still arabic music . 
  but the arabic influences are accepted by many medieval performers ( even in sacred music there are ensembles that perform medieval music blending mena styles with european polyphony ) . 
  here 's with eduardo paniagua , a scholar of medieval european and al-andalusi music states about troubadours  en la actualidad es complejo afirmar cuales fueron los or \u00edgenes de su existencia : la tradici\u00f3n latina medieval de los himnos del siglo vi , los versos de san marcial de iimoges , las carmina burana , las canciones profanas de los cl\u00e9rigos itinerantes ( goliardos ) , la poesia popular y las leyendas celtas ... ** y la imitaci\u00f3n de los poetas arabes ** there 's also a miniature in the cantigas , n120 that show a brown-skinned guy playing some sort of lute ( an arabic instrument ) next to a white guy . 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/cantiga_120_baldosa.jpg talking about `` inventing '' is wrong in this case , whatever the truth may be . 
  we 're not talking about science , no one really invented medieval music , it just happened as a result of multiple inputs ( arabic music/poetry just being one , not the only one ) . 
  edit : forgot to say that some medieval writers directly quotes arabic literature . 
  the tradition of the miraj https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isra_and_mi%27raj the book `` kit\u0101b al-mi\u02bdr\u0101\u01f5 '' ( liber scale ) is quoted in fazio degli uberti 's dittamondo ( italy , xiv century ) and dante 's teacher brunetto latini worked in toledo at the court of alfonso x , the same place where the cantiga miniature above comes from .
