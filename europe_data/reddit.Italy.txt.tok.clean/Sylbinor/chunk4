  f = ma is still a valid natural law in the rear seat . 
  no , i do n't feel bitter . 
  it is necessary to do a choiche , and unless we want to revive latin , we have to use a language that is already in use by someone . 
  but it is a bit annoying that native-english speaking countries do n't want to put a foreign language course in their schools ' core curriculum . 
  it would be nice , and useful , to have them learn at least the basic of a foreign language , as we do . 
  it 's impossible that genetics can change so drastically in such a short span of time ( 3000-4000 years are really nothing in evolutionary terms ) . 
  they worker harder , true , but so everybody did until a couple of hundreds years ago , but we do n't have paintings of a ripped soldier from 1600 or something like that . 
  ( plus , you really have to know what you are doing with your workout to reach a good definition . 
  no way you can sport a 6 pack just because you work in construction ) i guess that the real answer is that professional athlets were actually able to reach a very good shape , and then the sculptor just exagerated some feature . 
  you do n't really have to have just one model , you can use the torso of one athlet and the leg of another one . 
  do n't forget law . 
  civil law is a direct continuation of roman law . 
  my father did something very similar with my grandmother . 
  my uncle , his brother ( not twin ) , died 7 years ago of cancer . 
  the whole family , and i guess my uncle before dying , agreed to not tell her anything of the cancer and then of the death because she was fragile and had a lot of hearth issue . 
  they told her that my uncle was sent to africa by his company , thus he would not be able to visit or telephone her very much . 
  she used to have memory problems and she mixed up my father with my uncle all the time by phone . 
  so sometimes my father just went along whit it when it happened , and more rarely they would tell her that my uncle had visited her , but that she forgot it . 
  this seems like something mean to do , but she spent her remaining 2 years as an happy woman , instead as a grieving mother . 
  well , if you put it that way , schumacher litterally means `` shoes maker '' ... 
  neither did 99.9 % of us italian . 
  ferrari does not mean smith at all in standard italian . 
  it is probably a corruption of the regional word `` ferrai '' which means `` someone who work with iron '' * . 
  and even '' ferrai '' it 's not standard italian and is an old world . 
  the standard italian world for `` smith '' is `` fabbro '' . 
  it was n't the most voted party . 
  the numbers are out there . 
  it was n't . 
  nah , they speak italian and have the same culture ... they are way too small to really differentiate from italy . 
  take this sentence : `` we should build new houses '' . 
  if it is pronounced by mr x head of a ngo involved in assistance of the poors , it means one thing . 
  if it is pronounced by mr y , head of an huge building company , it means something different . 
  who said it * is * part of the context . 
  and you need context to fully understand a text . 
  that 's really interesting , it show how this is mostly a matter of culture . 
  here someone who receive welfare and spend it to live on his own would be seen as a freeloader by most people . 
  yup , there is a strong cultural component in this . 
  some countries just do n't have the `` go out of home as soon as possible '' , regardless of the income . 
  economic crisis is not the driving factor here , it is just causing that more people stay at home than usual . 
  it is mostly cultural . 
  there is absolutely no way that this is going to happen . 
  migration issues are a tiny speck of dust compared to the benefit of the schengen area . 
  that would be like cutting of your hand because you have a split nail . 
  in italy is two kisses , no particolar order . 
  man-woman / man-man / woman-woman , everybody kiss everybody . 
  in younger folks is less common to kiss man-man , but usually the same folks will kiss with no problem someone older than them ... 
  it 's even completely fine in formal situation , if you know already the person you are meeting . 
  it 's definetely worse , if you ask me . 
  but as i said it 's a different mentality , use of guns is seen as a relatively normal thing . 
  thus both criminals and police feel ok with using weapons . 
  some years ago a crazy man shot on the policemen guarding the government building during the ceremony of the formation of a new government , seriouously injuring two policemen . 
  he was blocked and arrested without a single shot fired by the police . 
  and italian pollice is ** not ** known to be particularly progressive . 
  it 's a different mentality . 
  americans tends to have a distrust for the government , any kind of government . 
  so a government with the capacity to watch them is hitting the wrong spots with them . 
  no , it works only with your own balls . 
  they may mimick the act of scratching `` their '' balls , usually saying `` let me scratch , even if i do n't have them ... '' again , this is pretty rude even with close friends ... 
  but it totally happens , sometimes . 
  yup , we `` knock '' , or actually just touch , iron . 
  the italian '' knock on wood '' is `` tocco ferro '' , which means '' [ i ] touch iron '' . 
  or we scratch our balls . 
  no , seriously , while the iron thing is to wish the good outcome of something , if you have to go against something bad happening , you are supposed to scratch your balls . 
  obviously that is ** very ** rude . 
  even with close friend is still borderline . 
  the reason why the law will be valid only next year instead of immediately is because the law to reform the upper house has still not passed . 
  ( this is normal , it 's a constitutional modification and you need a way longer process to do it ) . 
  it 's very improbable that the senators will decade when the new law will be passed , as that would basically be the same as dissolving the parliament , a power which his in not in the hand of the government or the parliament itself . 
  only the president of the republic can do that . 
  also , politically it does n't make much sense to put a deadline on your own government , i guess ... 
  who ? 
  tell me the sources , please . 
  the police should never beat the fuck out of anyone , no matter what . 
  actually they are anarchist , who are the polar opposite of the left . 
  it 's * the * world fair , actually . 
  the expo is just the modern name for the world 's fair . 
  you know , i never understood that whole `` italians talk with their hands '' until i had to explain how to reach a metro station to a tourist , and he could n't resist staring at my hands . 
  it was a bit rude of him , but that was the firs time i realized that i use a lot of very specific hand gestures . 
  that 's actually good ... 
  i mean , it 's gibberish , even if he mostly use actual words , but it 's refreshing to hear another `` version '' of what an italian accent sounds like . 
  honestly i have never understood where the `` it 's - a me mario '' accent came from ... 
  well , you can have an head of state democratically elected . 
  you have to give him no real power but a lot of `` representative '' power ( like he is the one who formally appoint the government and he is the one who do the end of the year discourse to the nation ) and make sure that he can be elected only by an high majority , thus being a person who is respected by more than one party . 
  during the peak of winter it 's dark at 6 o'clock everywhere in europe . 
  wait , gladio is n't a conspiracy theory in the sense of `` crazy stuff '' , it 's existence and it 's purpose as a stay-behind organization are an historical fact . 
  even the plane which was shot down it 's pretty much certain that something strange happened , but we do not know who did what . 
  public transport in europe is present almost everywhere . 
  a bus or a train will stop near where you live at least a couple of time a day , it is very , very rare to find a place that you ca n't reach without a car . 
  but it is actually pretty normal for the parents to drive their kids to school . 
  if we are talking about teenagers , some will buy a , hmm i do n't know the english name , a low power motorbike , which can be driven since you are 16yo . 
  stability . 
  luxembourg is surrounded by friendly and powerful neighbours . 
  imagine doing the same while bordering russia ... 
  if anyone is wondering , italy uses blue as the color for our sport teams because it was the color of the savoy house , which was the house of the king . 
  we just keept the color after we exiled the king . 
  yes , absolutely . 
  you guys in the usa are the only one with this strict no alchol rule . 
  do n't get me wrong , no parents encourage their kids to binge driniking or to get drunk . 
  but that a 16 yo at a party will drink alcohol is no big deal , everybody knows it . 
  it 's absolutely * not * encouraged , but it 's ok . a bit like `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' .
