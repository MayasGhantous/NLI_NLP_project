  for police to break up a party , in europe , you ** really ** need to be doing something bad . 
  if the police come , and they usually come only if they receive a lot of complaining , they will jus ask everybody to turn down the music or whatever . 
  they should , like , find people smoking weed in their face or something like that to break up a party . 
  i did some reasearch on it , and it seems that you can find words meaning poop , or poop related in several language , back to sanskrit . 
  it is unclear where this came from , but at this point is probably that this is one of those words that are so `` basic '' that they were conserved independently in many language since their indo-european origin . 
  there is mainstream support for it , but not major . 
  i mean , it 's not something that you only hear on the web , there are several parties that propone some sort of basic income , but they are usually `` average-small '' parties . 
  the problem is that in several european country the discussion about basic income was hijacked by populist party who tried to sell the idea as `` we can just give people money without changing whatsoever in the system '' , and thus they alienated a big chunk of the electorate . 
  compulsory militare service was abandoned in italy in 2005 . 
  i assure you that those problems did not arose after 2005 but where there since decades and decades . 
  also , since the compulsory draft was male-only , you are not explaining what was causing girls to behave correctly in society . 
  really ? 
  crap as in `` poop '' ? 
  in italian `` cacca '' litterally means `` poop '' . 
  i wonder if this is a coincidence or this is one of the few german word which entered the vocabulary of neo-latin languanges ... 
  what can you but with that ? 
  what is the average price for rent and food ? 
  we still watch it . 
  just watched it this morning on rai 2 ( public chanel ) . 
  in tuscany babbo is widely used as `` dad '' . 
  even if in the rest of italy is not commonly used , it has nothing to do with grandpa . 
  uhm , no . 
  babbo means dad or daddy . 
  absolutely not grandpa . 
  that is nonno . 
  babbo is a mostly tuscan world , you are right , but santa is babbo natale everywhere in italy . 
  well , shit . 
  i do n't know what is going down out there , then . 
  it 's because nobody wants to live in towns , if they have the chance to move . 
  we , as a society , are moving towards a model where living in a small town is way less convenient than living in a city , so a lot of people are moving in a city , sustaining an extremely high rais in prices . 
  i live in rome , and the value of my moderately sized flat it 's about as more than that of two houses of the same size in a small town . 
  if i want to rent a place , an average price is 400 $ ... * for a room * . 
  basically everywhere else ( except for milan ) you can rent a * whole flat * for 500 $ . 
  internationalism is an huge part of the left ideology , historically . 
  ideologically makes perfect sense . 
  well , the last time europe was so paceful was during the pax romana ... 
  a 100mq house goes for about 300.000 euros right now in my neighbourhood ( not the centre of rome , of course ) . 
  but you are talking about some neighbourhoods . 
  in europe you usually can draw concentric circle based on the income . 
  if i am in the centre of rome there is no way that i can afford an house in any direction in a radius of about 5km basically . 
  it means `` who 's paying you '' . 
  it 's purposedly written with a bad spelling to mock those kind of people who are absolutely convinced that you can not say something good about anything without someone paying you for that . 
  they are . 
  but at the same time half the country is ready to yell `` ki ti pakaaaa '' to people advertising good things . 
  it 's fub of this thing goes , you have tons of pizza and kebab place run by turkish , while here in italy they are almost everytime egyptians . 
  i wonder what cause this massive presence of immigrant from a country in an business . 
  free beaches are not very common since a lot of beaches are privately run . 
  since it 's public land with the specific purpose of giving people a chanche to go the sea for free , leaving your towel the night before and then showing up at 9 ' o clock it 's really a dick move . 
  it 's not first come , first serve , it 's more like exploiting a loophole . 
  100 years , or even 200 , is a really short time for a word as common as `` tea '' to be lost from records . 
  if there are no records of tea being called `` chay '' in venetian it means that they never called it that way . 
  well , banning war as a whole would be cool , but a bit unpratical at the moment . 
  they did n't learn . 
  they litterally changed a part of grillo 's website where they said that they wanted a referendum on the euro erasing that part . 
  without telling anyone about that , it was discovered by people on the web casually reading his website . 
  they are not `` productive '' by any means , they litterally support anything that can benefit them , no matter what . 
  because it 's something highly tecnical . 
  the italian constitution explicetely forbiddens referendums for international treaty or monetary policy . 
  ( i said monetary , not economically ), 
  they sell a shitload , thus they can cover most of their expenses with advertisiment . 
  also , printing a newspaper is cheap as hell . 
  i mean really , really cheap . 
  at those number of prints each copy will probably costs 3 cents or so . 
  i 'm italian and catalan is always strange to read , because when is written is often a bit easier to understand than spanish , but when it 's spoken it 's way harder than spanish to understand . 
  i do n't know if this is the case here , but stuff like this happens all the time . 
  it is more than enough that the minority is an elite of some kind , and people will start to imitate their way of speaking . 
  you know like in english there are a lot of words for food that are of french-origin when cooked , and german origin when talking about the animal ? 
  that 's because the french ruling class talked about what to eat , while the anglo-saxons peasant talked about the living animals . 
  they were a minority , but people wanted to be like them . 
  what ? 
  a degree in biology has nothing to do with vet stuff . 
  the most is some comparative anatomy . 
  and i assure you that knowing the name of a dog 's bone is not enough to cure a fracture in that bone . 
  really ? 
  poland is in the italian anthem too !, 
  not really . 
  we have a lot of evidence for the period , that did not change . 
  it 's just that during the ' 700 - ' 800 people had an hard on for the classical period and thus viewed its fall as the beginning of an age of dark . 
  but this is not based in anything , there is no evidence of a significant stagnation or setback in science or arts . 
  they probably progressed a bit slower for some decades , but nothing more . 
  italian singers are usually big in latin american . 
  and there are a couple of guys who for some reason are big in russia . 
  i do n't remember about frequent germanic tribes invasion of the po valley , the area was in celtic hands before the roman conquered it and the celts were n't germanic . 
  but do n't quote me on that . 
  the geopolitical centre of the area was for thousands of years the mediterranean sea . 
  north africa and the middle east were extremely rich places . 
  rome was in a strategic position in the mediterranean sea . 
  you really do n't need a river valley , you need a river . 
  and rome has that . 
  sigh . 
  the cassazione ** can not ** make something criminal . 
  we use civil law , not common law . 
  only and exclusively the parliament has the power to make something illegal . 
  the cassazione ca n't even judge about what happened . 
  they ca n't say if you are innocent or guilty . 
  what they do is check for errors or bad interpretations done during the trial . 
  they can uphold or dismiss a decision taken by a lower court , but they can not say anything about the validity of that decision . 
  the next time a case like this come up it can be ruled as legal , and if the lower court did everything by the books the cassazione will uphold the sentence . 
  yep . 
  `` helicopter money '' it 's an half-serious half-joke idea of literally throwing money from an helicopter to stimulate the economy .
