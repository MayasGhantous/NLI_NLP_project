* the marriage can be contested by both spouses if the spouses have agreed on not fulfilling the obligations and exercising the rights whence they came . 
  * it 's civil procedure though , not penal . 
  i posted in merit to the italian legislation , which does n't have a specific category for sham marriages for two reasons : they are a non-factor in italy and there 's already ample provision provided by the article 123 of the c.c. 
  which describes * marriage simulation * as a situation were the spouses do n't oblige with the duties of marriage ( for example , living together ) right from the start and deliberately . 
  evidently for the legislator , adding more would have been redundant .

  brie , nduja and cranberry jam is the stuff of legends . 
  i 've also tried brie + condensed aceto balsamico and arugula , and it was just divine . 
  i think brie is by far one of the most underrated sandwich cheese , and now my mouth is watering . 
  [ duetto ] ( http://www.eredibaruffaldi.com/images/prodotti/pon-gorgonzola-mascarpone.jpg ) , which is gorgonzola and mascarpone mixed together to form one glorious , heart attack inducing , block of creamy goodness . 
  [ brie ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/brie_de_meaux.jpg ) is amazing in toasted sandwiches , and there 's nothing better than eating feta with olives and stale bread , pretending to be an ancient greek philosopher . 
  lately i 've been trying out british cheese , and while good cheddar is horribly expensive here , it 's worth every cent . 
  oh man , those silly italians jurists , what do they know ? 
  it 's not like the cc is applying the principle of * counter-limitation * which is one of the basis of european constitutional tradition , even in ( ! ), 
  germany . 
  the lawyer championing the cause is german , by the way . 
  and by the way , who 's they ? 
  you mean the clearly money-grabbing duilio bergamini , who was imprisoned in a concentration camp and did it to honor the memory of a friend killed by the nazis ? 
  or are you implying that no one could possibly be alive after the end of wwii ? 
   they have such a awesome and rich history that i 'm surprised that their historians are only lagging behind by 60 years . 
  what surprises me is the neverending amount of sanctimony on this subreddit . 
  how insults are hidden behind a thinly veiled amount of paternalism , like being in a better economic situation automatically makes those less fortunate blubbering idiots . 
  usually they backtrack , saying it was only a joke , and * it 's the internet , man , take it easy * .

  mostly americans . 
  in florence you get people from all over the worls , but most hail from the us of a. 
  there 's a parallel florence which belongs to the yanks : they have their own pubs , clubs , places to eat , schools ( there 's a branch of the nyu in villa la pietra , and florence fashion school is like half japanese and half american ) . 
  i like it , personally . 
  sorry for the late answer . 
   because those clothes can be manufactured much more cheaply there than in europe , not only because of labor costs , but also because they have much bigger scales . 
  that is a fact of life . 
  we used to have textile and clothing manufacturing in finland , those days are long gone . 
  the firms that are left either specialised to segments that are small and need special knowhow , or moved their production of the country and concentrated their efforts here to marketing and design . 
  not trying to diss finland at all , but there are entire ** cities ** in italy that revolve around textile manufacturing ( prato , for example ) or metalworking . 
  you just ca n't discontinue your industrial base when you reach a certain size . 
  again , i 'm trying to avoid the * tiny homogenous nordic nation * stereotype , but it is true that certain solutions can only be applied on a certain scale . 
  you ca n't completely subsitute a centennial industry that is deeply embedded within the social , economical , political and cultural structure of a nation without dire consequences that frankly do n't even seem to pay off at all . 
  let 's just put aside the causes because i think we both agree on what 's the problem and how to solve it : make labour laws less convoluted , streamline bureacracy and so on . 
  great , let 's do an * ad absurdum * . 
  the necessary measures and reforms have been made . 
  now we just have to decide in what direction to push . 
  you say that we should subside a significant part of our industry to countries with less labour cost , which is something that is already happening to a degree in every western country , and keep the design process and the excellence of our engineers , designers and whatnot . 
  i think it 's not really thinking in the long term . 
  sure , italy has a history of excellence when talking about design , clothing , engineering . 
  china does n't . 
  bangladesh does n't . 
  that 's true , of course . 
  but eventually the gap closes . 
  in thirty , forty years , do you think there wo n't be a generation of respected engineers , designers and whatnot hailing from beijing or chengduan ? 
  i live in florence , which houses one of the most prestigious design school in europe ( and consequently the world ) . 
  the majority of the students are chinese , or from adjacent asian countries . 
  already china and india are building a reputation around the world concerning their engineers . 
  eventually design will also shift places , it 's a slippery slope . 
  on the advanced machinery sector i do agree with you . 
   the textile manufacturers had plenty of time to move from low value manufacturing to more specialised and more valued manufacturing , but they were too lazy and incompetant to do so , thus they went out of business . 
  i love this kind of logic . 
  stop producing on a mass scale !, 
  do n't you know that you can sustain your economy with just ferragamo and lamborghini ? 
  clothes that are under 500 $ a piece should only be produced in china and bangladesh because ... reasons . 
  just turn your mass producing factory in a high end prada boutique , with one hundred times the advertising costs and one thousandth of a market . 
  this is just a naive stereotype . 
  you do n't sustain an entire economy and 60 + million people with high end sports car , expensive clothing and wine . 
  is the problem immanent in the italian labour laws ? 
  it is . 
  is turning into a nation-sized apple the solution ? 
  it is n't . 
  un law or eu does n't supercede ** anything ** that could possibly be contained in a constitution . 
  the constitution of a country is by definition the highest autority in terms of law , and the spanish constitution only remits sovereignty to international treaties that do n't infringe the core of the constitutional prerogatives . 
  ok so there 's one everyone dislikes because apparently he was a genocidial maniac . 
  so let 's not talk about him , let 's talk about this mofo right here , [ amerigo vespucci ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amerigo_vespucci ) . 
  not only he was first to realize that he was exploring an entirely new continet , he was so good at his job that cartographers decided to name an entire continent after him . 
  he rediscovered alpha and beta centauri after centuries of obscurity , was the first one to reach the bay of rio de janeiro and rumors say he had a hand in the naming of venezuela . 
  apparently he did n't try to enslave the natives , so there 's also that . 
  the most famous one is probably [ la leggenda del piave ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vluxujvsmw0 ) which talks about the decisive battle of the piave river , which italy won after a terrible defeat at caporetto ( even now caporetto has the same idiomatic meaning in italian as waterloo in english ) . 
  there 's also [ bella ciao ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ci3lhynkfo ) , an antifascist song sung by partisans and eventually became one of most recognisable songs associated with communism . 
  another one is [ fischia il vento ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=telagblqhzq ) , which is not completely italian , since the melody is from a popular russian war-song , katyusha . 
  the text was written by a young poet named felice cascione who died in a gunfight with fascist soldiers . 
  there are four different licenses , with the same basic entry bars : various medical requirements , including minimum 8/10 visual acuity and no history of mental ilnesses . 
  you also must have a clean criminal record and follow a weapon handling course certified by the uits ( unione italiana tiro a segno ) . 
  two licenses are for sport and hunting , the other two are for personal defence . 
  the first is for small arms + carry , and it 's almost always denied ( usually , if you need protection that badly , that means that the mafia is trying to sic you and the police is already protecting you ) . 
  the second is for rifles , and it 's usually given to people living relatively far from civilization . 
  sport/hunting licenses are valid for six years , while personal defence ones are yearly . 
  in the immortal words of italy 's greatest satyrist corrado guzzanti : * oh sure , if you need a proof for evolution look no further . 
  other countries , you know , the advanced ones , they 're like those beautiful and colorful parrots of the tropical jungle . 
  they 're incredible to look at , everybody likes them , and they 're perfectly adapted to their environment . 
  now look at italians : nobody likes them , nobody trusts them , nobody thinks anything of them , yet they persevere . 
  like coackroaches that thrive on noxious radiations , they have withstanded foreign rule , a government that constantly tries to fuck them over and even themselves . 
  yet they are still there , like an ugly , persistent bug whose only redeemable trait is its resilience . 
  * at the end of this speech the theatre was roaring with applauses . 
  i guess we do n't really have an high opinion of ourselves . 
  in italian you can either use * lei * , which is the equivalent of * she * ( the expression meaning * be formal with someone * is * dare del lei * , literally * give the she * ) , or * voi * ( plural of you ) like many other european languages . 
  however , * voi * is increasingly uncommon for historical reasons : during the fascist years , using * lei * was prohibited because mussolini deemed it `` too bourgeois '' . 
  so in modern days , * voi * is almost never used except by old people and in some rural communities ( especially in the south , where it was common to use the * voi * with parents ), 
  if by * pronounced the same way * you mean with an additional affricate , which is pronounced in a completely different way from a nasal .
