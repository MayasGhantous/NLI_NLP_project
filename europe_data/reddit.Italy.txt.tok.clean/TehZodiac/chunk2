  you 'd need to have hearing problems not to hear the difference . 
  unless you tell me you ca n't distinguish between * scene * and * since * , which according to your logic should be practically indistinguishable . 
  you 're asking too much from the nyt . 
  just be grateful that there was n't any mention about the * bella figura * , the tuscan countryside and how the author passed a summer in italy and as such is able to tap into the conflicting and relaxed italian attitude to life and present it to the average british/american worker , hardened by honest work and lack of gesticulating . 
  you italians sure are a contentious people . 
  the voting agenda is decided in voting sessions between the * capigruppi * of the various parliamentary groups , no bureacracy here ( we 're also talking about parliamentary works , so the term is more than improper , flat-out wrong ) with that said , i 've checked the working calendar of the senate , up until the 1st of april , and there was no mention of bill . 
  so it 's probably going to be voted after the new corruption ddl . 
  i probably came across as * that guy * . 
  [ ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) ] ( http://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2015/03/26/double-digit-contract-growth-in-jan-feb_2545d8d4-c354-4cb0-9bf4-9402371309c3.html ), 
  dota 2 , a game that truly brings europe together in its hatred for russians pubbers . 
  why , yes , i * have * missed a double pull . 
  sure , you can call me a pederast , if you so desire . 
  although friend , mayhaps we should converge upon the middle lane and push lest we find our rectum violently ravaged by a six-slotted medusa ? 
  after all , it 's 40 minutes in and you 've done is farm - yes , yes i 'm quite the * blyat cyka idi nahui * , lovely . 
  1 ) there 's no chief of executive , constitutionally . 
  the pm ( in italian presidente del consiglio ) is a primus inter pares , and does n't hold the same powers as a say , german chancellor . 
  politically , the personalization of politics worldwide and the fact that the eu chiefly speaks and organizes through national governments means that like everywhere else the pm has become the key political figure in italy , even if the constitution does n't give it particular importance if any . 
  2 ) italy will remain a parliamentary republic tout court , so you do n't directly vote for the pm . 
  specifically in italy the winning party or coalition presents their candidate to the president of the republic , who then gives provisional clear for the candidate to select the ministers . 
  then the government present itself to the parliament and undergoes an immediate vote of confidence . 
  3 ) the president of the republic is already the commander in chief of the military , always has been . 
  also , the pdr is in no way a figure-head , has numerous relevant powers and is very much relevant politically . 
  not to mention that since the start of the 2000s the consiglio supremo di difesa has become , under the push of various pdr , the main decider of italian military foreign policy . 
  4 ) italy is a liberal democracy , so the judiciary powers are fully indipendent . 
  in fact , a common critique to the italian system is that they are too indipendent , leading to politicized trials . 
  debatable , but not wholly false . 
  the consiglio superiore della magistratura ( commonly shortened to csm ) is the self-government institution of the judiciary and has the authority over the careers , promotions , relegations , etc. 
  of all the magistrates in italy . 
  the guardiasigilli can ask for disciplinary actions on a specific magistrate but the csm is under no obligation to follow through . 
  he took it from contemporary history . 
  the relationship between france and italy has been rocky ( if not semi-hostile in very specific period ) to say the least since the early 80s . 
  do n't take this subreddit with its regional pizzas threads and proclamation of love for fellow latin/romance language brothers as an indication of anything other than friendly people discussing on the internet . 
  there was a serious diplomatic crisis between italy and france for the better part of two decades , from 1985 to 2002 . 
  not to mention that historically france tried with success , ( and a big help from italy itself detaching itself from european politics ) to exclude italy from the franco-german decision-making axis , and still does it to this day . 
  geopolitically france and italy are almost always at odds . 
  of course we 're talking about the highest levels of government , obviously there 's no beef between the general populace . 
  the special statute regions not only retain the majority of their local tax money , but they also do n't have to pay local law enforcement . 
  not to mention that the enlightened and practically austrians ( so above reproach , unlike italians ) sudtiroleans are infamous across the country for having a bloated public sector ( over the national average by ** 32 % ** ) and for having oustanding emoluments ( the former president of south tyrol , luis durnwalder , got a totally deserved 12.000 $ a month , ** net ** , higher than the president of the us ) , and for overcharging public services so that rome is forced to give them more than what they 'd actually need ; sudtirol is also the region that receives the most liquidity from rome per capita , almost 9000 $ in bozen ; compare it to the national average of 3600 $ . 
  well , there are places ( actually only new zealand ) where the constitution can be amended with regular law . 
  also there is something called excess of costitutionalization , the french costitution of 1791 required , if i 'm not mistaken , 4 different parliaments to vote favourably , in succession , on the same text . 
  in an old 19th century swiss constitution there were provisions on the institution of a kindergarten in a specific city of the german canton . 
  i study it so i kinda cheated , eheh . 
  comparative constitutional law is very interesting but kind of checklisty . 
  italy employs another common device , aggravated procedure with double voting ( timed ) with a qualified majority and optional referendum if 2/3 majority is not reached ; if so , 5 regional councils , 1/5 of the members of a chamber or 500k voting citizens can request the referendum . 
  it may sound weird , but this form of constitutional revision ( for a revision to be voted upon by two different parliaments ) is actually one of the most common in the world : art . 
  94 denmark ( 1915 ) and art . 
  88 denmark ( 1953 ) , art . 
  79 iceland , art . 
  114 luxembourg , art . 
  68 romania ( 1953 ) , art . 
  viii art . 
  15 of the law on the instruments of the government sweden , art . 
  112 norway , art . 
  137 netherlands and the list goes on . 
  actually , that is not true . 
  there is a clear and unabashed scienter in how common law in the us and the uk is jurisprudential in nature , meaning that the judges and the court actively contribute to the creation of law , even if they do n't draft acts or vote them in the parliament . 
  it 's not a matter of different praxis . 
  in common law systems , judges make law , that 's how they want it and how they like it . 
  stare decisis is the key point here : in civil law systems , higher courts and their sentencings bind only the interested proceeding , not the entirety of the law . 
  well , i ca n't read german , so i can only rely on the translated article , which has no mention of the * greater democratic accountability * that would subsume this proposal . 
  and that is still a non-sequitur , by the way . 
  i do n't see how transfering more sovereignty to the eu institutions would result in more democracy . 
  it 's basically implying that the more the member states are absorbed in the eu , the more democratic the eu will be ? 
  makes zero logical sense , like i ca n't literally follow the thought process behind it . 
  the eu is undemocratic because the executive branch has no political accountability and is the only one with the power to initiate the legislative process . 
  the only organ of the eu that is directly elected by the citizens and that has parliament ( ! ), 
  in its name , does not have that prerogative ( !!!!!!!!! ), 
  and has to share the legislative process with guess what , an unelected institution that is completely and utterly redundant . 
  basically we have an institution where the only the government has the power to write laws , and the parliament has to share its prerogatives with an unelected semi-kinda government . 
  and the big idea is to give more power to this institution ? 
  i legitimately do n't get it , if you can shed light on this please do because i really do n't get it . 
   german , french yeah , right . 
  why am i not surprised ? 
  anyway , the best way to take steps forward the federalization process , and show that the eu is not just about the monies and bureaucracy ? 
  forget about reforming the treaties , pushing for a centralized identity , an hymn , an actual european constitution , a well structured form of government suited to an actual confederation , more democratic participation from the european citizens , fuck that noise . 
  what we need , is member states renouncing basically one of the tenets of sovereignity , control over one 's economic policies , without amending this deeply convoluted , inefficient , undemocratic , half-finished mess of a union . 
  and of course this joint finance minister wo n't be a part of the economical orthodoxy northern-european block , no siree , it will be totally * super partes * , and with the best interest of the eu in mind ... are people actually falling for this shit ? 
  making an ever closer union by creating a joint finance minister for the eurozone that overrides national decisions is like learning how to drive using an f1 car . 
  there 's jumping the gun , and there 's this ... 
  you realize that all these critiques are the tell-tale signs that you know absolutely nothing about communism and marxism ? 
  you even admitted , with no regards to your intellectual honesty ( and apparently the few who upvoted you ) , that you have n't read das kapital ( and i presume not a single line by marx , proudhon , engels , lukacs etc etc ) and then you point out presumed flaws in communism , completely self-assured . 
  i mean , how can you process , in your head , the fact that you consider the champagne socialists hypocrites , but not yourself ? 
  you wan na know why people still study and use marx in academic settings , while not being marxists themselves , even though enlightened internet warriors like you pointed the numerous failings of marxist theory ? 
  it 's because they 're stoooooopid ? 
  or maybe it 's because they 've actually read marx and know that this * communism does n't work irl becoz people be greedy * and * how is marx so stoopid dont know people like power * is absolute bullshit ? 
  and i 'm sure you 'll ask me to disprove it . 
  all you have to do , is pick up das kapital , or the gotha programme , or the german ideology . 
  it 's right there , black over white . 
  but in the internet era , things must be easy , and easily digestible , so if someone ca n't provide a graph from euobserver or a terrible wikipedia article , it 's like he/she 's not even there . 
  fuck reading the actual books before discussing economics , philosophy and sociology . 
  let 's watch a five minute video from vsauce or whatever . 
  the facts are that zadra was in open contrast with martin selmayr ( a german ) since past year , and coincidentally he was removed from duty a couple of days after renzi and merkel had an argument over the monetary union . 
  you can interpret that however you want . 
  i personally believe it 's unfortunate timing , but i would n't bet on it . 
  the failure to understand what berlusconi and berlusconism actually is is one of the symptoms of why he managed to get elected multiple times . 
  inflating the concept of berlusconi to some kind of noumenic * bad politician * archetype is very topical here , a * reductio ad berlusconem * , if you will . 
  nothing of what was actually wrong with berlusconi is truly comprehended and addressed , he 's just conveniently used as a label ( just as hitler , not joking ) to make politicians we do n't like look less credible . 
  renzi is by no means perfect and i disagree with many ( if not all ) his championed reforms . 
  but he has nothing , and i bold the ** nothing ** , in common with berlusconi . 
  his reforms , his way of interacting with the electorate , his electorate , how he talks , the medium he uses to express himself , the way he sees and talks in europe , there is no point of contact whatsoever .
