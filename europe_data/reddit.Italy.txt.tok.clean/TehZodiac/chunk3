  you 're downvoted because you 're completely detached from the political reality of italy . 
  for the italian center-left/neolaburisti ( renzi and renziani ) and for the moderate left and socialists ( bersaniani , d'alemiani , cuperlo ) obama is a well-liked leader and a very positive example of governance . 
  he 's a moderate leftist with some socialist streaks in policy , so there 's something to like for everyone . 
  his opinion and endorsement are very much relevant for that political elite and their electorate , which currently represents the majority of the voters in italy . 
  glossing over the fact that half of what you said this vignette straight up is n't there , and the other half is just stereotypes you commonly associate with ... you know what , let 's not gloss over it . 
  if i make a vignette satirizing the rapist nature of mexicans , i 'm not satirizing anything but myself . 
  always associating italians with corruption , mafia and laziness just shows the inwardness , sanctimony and ignorance of the culture that spawned the so called satire . 
  after all , if i make a vignette about a monkey with a french beret raising a white flag in front of a terrorist while wolfing down a wheel of cheese , what am i satirizing ? 
  nothing , because those are simply stereotypes ( the cheese eating surrender monkeys ) , they are not representatives of anything of worth in french culture , they do no give pause , they do n't make the french reflect , because the french are ** not ** cheese eating surrender monkeys so you 're literally criticizing a vice that is not there , it 's just a simple and offensive stereotype . 
  do you think italian satirists are about le kek pasta pizza mafia ? 
  they must be , right ? 
  after all , that is all there is to know about when it comes to italy , pizza and mafia jokes . 
  usually good satirists have the modesty to understand that one can rarely understand more than a set of national vices in one lifetime . 
  aristofanes did n't write about persian or egyptian vices . 
  he wrote about what he knew , and knew very well . 
  so did twain , jerome and such on . 
  so , assuming that everything you said is there ( and it is n't ) , it says a lot more about the culture that spawned the satirist that the culture that is supposed to be satirizing . 
  read the clouds if you want to see what actual intelligent , thoughtful satire looks like . 
  or three men on a boat . 
  or the great gatsby . 
  or asterix and obelix , why not . 
  this is just drivel made to sell copies . 
   however , both police and prosecution usually are appointed into positions of leadership by the executive power . 
  in this case italy differs from the usual . 
  prosecutors and judges in italian law belong to the same order , and they can switch from one position to the other ( meaning a prosecutor can become a judge and viceversa ) more than once in their careers . 
  so the prosecution does represent the executive power in court , but it 's not appointed , governed , reprimanded or run by it , but rather by the csm , the self-governing body of the judiciary branch . 
  also , theholeinsidemychest is right , the expulsion order in this case is the one described in article 13 of the t.u.i. , an executive order , pertaining exclusively to the ministry of interior , the judge is involved for the nulla osta only . 
  non-eu citizens are granted the basic human and constitutional rights . 
  but if you do n't have citizenship , european or italian , the state has full authority over whether you 're allowed to stay or not , and it 's discretionary . 
  it sounds harsh but that 's the way it is , and the way it has historically been , not just in italy , but almost every country . 
  you 're just mixing together a lot of things . 
  as svizzero2016 points out , kis also factors in pa , which is the main employer in all northern states and really murks the numbers . 
  also you 're assuming that advanced sectors , the more you have them , the better off you are , which is n't true . 
  for example , in italy , tuscany , marche and veneto are heavily industrialized and highly competitive in the international markets while have nothing to do with electronics ; the long tradition of textile and shoe-making , centuries long , combined with a series of specific structural ( abundance of public funded externalities , small , lean factories which work in a sub-contracting web ) and political factors give them an edge over other regions in europe , who had to `` cave in '' , and switch to technology and r&d . in short , these are regions which did not have to take the * high-road development * strategy . 
  so there are few technological and electronics industries , but they are still very competitive and innovative . 
  looking outside of italy , another region who did n't take the high road and still came out a-ok is the jutland in denmark , which has very competitive textile industries and is very similar to tuscany in more than a way . 
  the gdp per capita does n't really factor in at all . 
  in short , you 're equating economic well being with abundance of high tech industry , while it is merely a correlation , or rather the successfull strategy of a very specific group of countries who could n't compete otherwise . 
  you 're contradicting yourself . 
  gaining influence in an other northern african country necessarily means sabotaging the country which has the influence . 
  it 's not like lybia was ripe for taking and there were a couple of small italian industries just lying there . 
  lybia was a major italian stronghold on the other side of the med , crucial to security and energy policies , and an historical colony . 
  sarkozy deliberately tried to expand on lybia to take over italy 's place , it was n't an afterthought . 
  he failed miserably because the french establishment still thinks it 's 1830 and that they are actually a world power . 
  being liked or not it 's irrelevant . 
  france forced the hand on lybia , indirectly booting eni out of it , and ( what a coincidence ) , french business conglomerates decide now it 's the time to start buying up majority shares in several important italian ventures . 
  the same champions of france that are the posterchild of french * statalisme * . 
  surely it 's just a coincidence . 
  i do n't get it , for once there 's literally no intrigue or acute powerplay , it 's so banal and straigthforward and in your face . 
  as for your question , mitterand doctrine , avio attempted takeover , libya ( duh ) , the mattei murder ... 
   why would france ever want to destabilize the italian economy ? 
  italy is one of the very few true ally france has . 
  no it is n't . 
  france and italy have been sabotaging each other geopolitically and diplomatically for at least 50 years . 
  and the downvotes on malverno are completely nonsensical . 
  the fact that france wanted to destabilize syria to force eni and other italian companies to move out the region and take their place is considered a given by contemporary historian . 
  italy has tried to do the same , to a lesser extent , in central africa . 
  the attitude on this , * oh , we 're all latin bros * has no bearing on actual geopolitics . 
  they 're not an international outward looking organization . 
  camorra is a collection of several dozens warring clans around campania . 
  you 're just throwing together hollywood romanticizing and gomorra . 
  also the idea that there wo n't be a referendum because camorra ( really , of all the ones you chould choose , you chose the ** least influential ** and the ** most inward looking ** , which makes me think you 're just basing this off movie and stereotypes ) ? 
  that 's so puzzlingly nonsensical that it 's actually kind of offensive . 
  actually , it is offensive , you just assume everything of political relevance in italy is related to organized crime , but i assume you get mad if people stereotype romanians as thieves . 
  and what 's even more amazing is that you present it as an acute revelation that is so ** obvious ** now that you just assume people will get it even if you speak in riddles . 
  also good job on completely botching not only the organization which is supposed to rule italy from the shadows , but also on completely misreading the m5s as a political organization . 
   social sciences are not built on a foundation of quantifiable fact neither are `` hard sciences '' , but i doubt anything i ( or people far smarter than me ) say is going to burst through the thick layer of mental onanism around your head . 
  i mean , the fact that all sciences by methodology are axiomatic in nature is a given in epistemiology and philosophy of science . 
  but considering this is reddit , you 'll probably rebuke with an example that has nothing to do with the matter at hand ( say , for example , that philosophy or sociology never took the man on the moon or created a car or a computer ) , or maybe ( but that 's a lot rarer ) you 'll actually try to somehow justify the fact that hard sciences are better with the fact that they land you a higher paying job ( debatable at best , straight up false in most countries ) : the market considers them more important . 
  congratulations , you just used a ** social science ** ( economics ) to try and prove that ** social sciences ** are worthless . 
  the cowardice of the king is not in question : he had at the time , and for the entirety of the regime , the almost complete loyalty of the armed forces . 
  declaring the state of emergency during the march of the rome ( as the general staff advised him to do ) is considered probably the most straightforward historical what if by italian historians : there would n't have been a fascist regime . 
  if it was only that , it could have been forgiven , but he enabled the fascist regime in its entirety every single time it faced a crisis , escaped rome leaving it in the hand of the nazis when the grand council of fascism betrayed mussolini and brokered an armistice , and was never even repentant , not even once , for the pain and the suffering his cowardice caused for his subject . 
  a george vi he was n't . 
  the hypothetical current king of italy is a repulsive individual , addicted to gambling , antisemitic , confirmed member of the p2 lodge , accused of murder , exploitation of prostitution and other savory activites . 
  his son ( the prince of the article ) is a normal person , but we 're still yet to receive a formal apology from the savoy , after all these years . 
  they almost took the country to complete ruin thanks to their cowardice and it seems extreme to you ? 
  the constituents had family and friends killed by fascists , fascists that the savoy family helped in more ways than one . 
  as for the widespread support , there 's no way of knowing for certain , as there were n't any demoscopic companies at the time ( duh ) . 
  `` back then '' does n't really tell anything because mussolini lasted 20 years , and his regime had many ups and downs in popularity . 
  but if you 're asking if there was a time when basically the entire country rallied behind him , there never was one . 
  keep in mind that a civil war was fought between the fascists and the communist in 1921 and 1922 : those people did n't disappear . 
  the regime was never much popular in the northern part of the country ( more industrialized and inclined to socialism ) and the central part of the country ( strong communist tradition , thanks to people like errico malatesta ) . 
  they were sold with fraudulence . 
  the info investors were given were completely false , on the risk , on the interest rate , on everything . 
  i suppose in the netherlands pensioners are biologically immune to fraud . 
  either that or you 're going to tell me even if they were lied to , it 's still somewhat their fault . 
  and what the fuck is the ** we ** ? 
  it 's a bailout plan financed by the italian government . 
  what do you have to do with it ? 
  this is italian taxpayer money we 're talking about . 
  you do n't have ** anything ** to do with it . 
  or you just simply assumed that since it 's italy =  southern europe =  muh debt =  muh northern european money . 
  i swear to god , this * in the netherlands , germany , sweden , shambala we do n't ... * is becoming the new * as an american * . 
  partly it was to `` protect '' the lateran treaties or nato treaties with the vatican from a possible referendum by the communist party , which was ** huge ** in italy ( the biggest in the western world ) , partly because , as sylbinor said , the laws on which you ca n't have a referendum are either completely out of the depth of normal , every day people ( tributary and budget laws ) , ca n't be left to the political whims of a specific moment ( international treaties ) or have no reason to be judged fit by the voters ( amnisty laws ) . 
   that 's because people earn more now , so they do n't need to begin working at 6 or work until they die ( assuming they bothered to save for their retirement ) . 
  that has nothing to do with the ( undisputable ) fact that work hours , work days , work weeks and work years have been shortening since the start of the century . 
  first of all , there was a massive political campaign by socialist political forces in all industrialized countries for the better part of a century to gradually reduce the working day , and it succeded . 
  after that , working productivity continued to rise immensely thanks to technological and sociological advancements ( for example , a better understanding of the worker 's psychology , or new ways of production like the toyota way ) , up until to a point where a `` society of work without work '' , as hannah arendt put it , is starting to appear . 
  a society where welfare policies are tailored ( in case of anglosaxon countries ) or are starting to shift ( everybody else ) towards the need for a job to be a recipient , where taxes and income breaks , where services rendered and rights are centered around the `` working man '' , but with not enough work for everyone .
