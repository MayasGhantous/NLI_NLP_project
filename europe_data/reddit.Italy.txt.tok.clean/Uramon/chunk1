the fact that you replied to my comment where i was specifically talking about italy , are you even aware of what you 're doing ? 
  i thought you were referring to italy . 
  brraking news : there are countries not as rich as germany / s, 
  umm it 's 46 %, 
  please note that what this guy is saying is 50 % true . 
  i mean , a lot of italians live with their parents but it 's because of economic reasons , the real estate market here is awful and generally expensive , people often start working and wait to have collected enough money to afford the rent ( or the selling price ) of new apartments . 
  do n't listen to the dumbasses spreading the `` mammoni '' legend , it 's no more like that since 50 years at least, 
  [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/6/63/cannabis_trend.png ) the trend of cannabis consumption in eu countries till 2010 . 
  according to a more recent source ( [ repubblica ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/salute/2017/06/06/news/consumo_cannabis_italia_seconda_in_europa-167396233/ ) newspaper ) , italy is second at cannabis consumption at 6 june 2017 ( only france did better ) , while we are 4th for opioids use and 8th for cocaine . 
  [ this ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/diffusione_delle_droghe_nell%27unione_europea ) is a nice wikipedia page with datas from all the eu , too bad there 's not the english version , use google translate, 
  [ yes of course ] ( https://i.imgur.com/75k2xmp_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=high ), 
   burying power lines in just a single state can cost tens of billions of dollars . 
  it 's impractical on a large scale . 
  when a million other things are competing for budget money , burying power lines becomes a very low priority . 
   http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/12/us/winter-storm-power-lines/index.html so why do we have buried power lines almost everywhere in the urban part of the county ? 
  are we way richer than united states to afford the mantainance and installation ? 
  come on be honest, 
   underground power lines can cost up to 10 times as much as above ground lines come on what are you , a micro-nation with no money ? 
   they also do n't last as long false  are more expensive to maintain and replace i do n't think so , sources ? 
  i swear to god i did n't saw the other italian guy pointing out the same thing until i posted this comment, 
  in usa ( l.a. in particular ) they still use poles with transformers and high tension cables [ like this ] ( http://www.temcotransformer.com/poletransformers.jpg ) while in europe it 's all under the ground since decades . 
  i was a bit concerned when i saw them, 
   how it 's different i 'll make it easy : countries do n't really collaborate but everyone try to get all the possible advantages for itself not caring for the common interest that should make europe stronger than everything else . 
  some countries in particular are greedier and more opportunistic than others , i 'll let you guess which ones, 
  here it 's exactly like austria . 
  the vending machines require an italian health insurance card ( owned by every italian citizen ) to verify your age . 
  cigarettes and all tobacco products in general can be sold only in those places which have a license for that , called `` tabaccherie '' ( tobacconist or tobacco shop ) . 
  most of the bars have this license and a `` tobacco area '' where products are exposed and sold , but not all the supermarkets have it . 
  it 's definitely not like russia where ( apparently ? ), 
  you can get cigarettes litterally everywhere , despite i would ' t say it 's hard to buy tobacco in italy . 
  there are tabaccherie like at every corner . 
  small packs of 10 cigarettes have been banned since this january , only packs of at least 20 cigarettes are sold now . 
  prices : it 's around 4.50 $ ( taking chesterfield blue pack as example ), 
  pineapple pizza, 
  most of europeans do n't know much about the policies of dem and rep parties in usa , aside from the `` big topics '' like the ones you mentioned, 
  you can find a couple of aloe vera drinks in almost every market but they are not popular at all, 
  better than our . 
  why did you have to open two threads for this ? 
  two related questions are legit in one single thread, 
   you did not show any evidence . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6n8dfp/which_region_in_your_country_is_known_for_being/dkab8oz/ ) . 
   * south tyroleans are the largest `` catalysts '' of public money allocated by the state to local authorities , administrations and funds . 
  * let me focus  * public money allocated by the state to local authorities * does it really say  *** public money ***  *** allocated by the state *** ? 
  well looks like i did tell you where they come from . 
  state . 
  italian state . 
  not south tyrolean state , right ? 
  and guess what , the italian state collect taxes from all the regions to redistribute afterwards . 
  they not only keep their own 90 % . 
   if you dislike them so much , and everybody thinks they get money from the others , may be let them go ? 
  no , just end these useless privileges that were given after ww2 ( 1948 ) since it 's obvious they do n't need them any longer , their economy , infrastructures and administration can survive without the special status perfectly . 
  after ? 
  like between 1945 and 1955 ? 
  because that 's  the very next period of social , political and economic reorganization i was talking about . 
  or maybe you mean after 1955 ? 
  i bet you do n't , since in 1960 an international jury interviewed by the `` financial times '' had in fact attributed to the lira the `` oscar '' of the strongest and most stable currency in the western world . 
  ( [ source ] ( http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/cultura/2011-10-23/miracolo-umano-081547_prn.shtml ) ), 
   special conditions beeing a consequence of high gdp this has no sense by any mean . 
   they have an excellent local economy never denied that , but that alone is not enough to get the welfare they have . 
   the people in tourism let the money coming into the region trickle into the region , they spend for local arts and crafts , food , services etc. 
  this seems to work really good from what i saw , and it makes perfect sense . 
  nothing that any other region does n't do as well . 
   the german speaking community sticks together , and spends the money in the region , with success i would say . 
  the thing is they ** do n't ** only spend ** their own money ** but special status grants them to get back from the state more than what they give , as a region . 
  how many times i 'm supposed to repeat this ? 
   have an unbiased look , and see if they do may be some things better than others . 
  i have been there several times , there 's nothing they do significantly better than other north region to explain the surplus of money . 
   i see things there which are better than in germany like what ? 
  are you saying that lira was very volatile during a world war and in the very next period of social , political and economic reorganization ? 
  i do n't want to seem arrogant , but i 'm still not surprised at all, 
   they profit from their work and do only transfer 10 % of taxes to rome let 's assume it 's actually like that ( and of course bolzano has the highest gdp per capita due to being a province with special status that give it all the benefits i was talking about before , not just because `` they work better than other regions in the north '' ) , why south tyrol can do that in addition to all the befefits it already has while a region like lombardy which has 20x the population , 100x the infrastructures and administrative charges , and it 's the main reason for which italy has n't already drowned , has an ordinary status and ca n't spend 90 % of its taxes for itself ? 
  what free fall are you talking about ? 
  [ this ] ( http://st.ilfattoquotidiano.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/italia-lira-ecu.jpg ) is the value of lira compared to ecu ( * european currency unit * that gave to the euro it 's value ) . 
  i ca n't see any free fall . 
  there had been a lowering of value since 1995 but i would n't call it free fall . 
  do you mean that ? 
  do you mean that central european bank take advantage of that ? 
  what a surprise, 
  i have found something , looks like a law to grant a special fiscal federalism to the provinces of trento and bolzano and enforce their financial autonomy . 
  also looks to be applied to these two provinces only . 
  this would widen the gap of benefits even more , since the taxes in ordinary statute regions are managed more or less as i explained before, 
  what i did mean is that he is n't true indeed . 
  nazi germany is over since 70 years , europe is not like that . 
  yes some taxes can be adjusted by the region within limits , and fractions of some taxes do n't actually leave the region to be invested by the region itself and for itself ( sorry for repetitions ) , but the biggest ( by far ) part of the total taxes collected are redistributed through the central state . 
   mailand treaty 2010 i 'm not sure about what that is , any link ? 
   if they region can spend 90 % of the taxes they collect in the region no wait , it does n't work like this , we 're not a federation . 
  i 'll try to explain in the easiest way possible : citizens pay taxes ( some more , some less , depending on the region ; in the case of south tyrol , less than any other region ) . 
  most of these taxes are sent to the central state that subsequently redistributes the money to the regions basing on various things , like population , economy , and of couse * special statuses * owned by some regions , like south tyrol . 
  they basically pay the lowest amount of taxes to get one of the highest money return for an italian region, 
  i 'm sure to have heard it by some americans, 
   ** almost ** 1 $ = 2 german marks = 6 finnish marks = 6,55 french franks = 166,386 spanish pesetas = 1936,27 italian lire , and so on . 
  [ only 4 countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:euro_adoption_past ) had a more convenient conversion for exports , countries that could n't threat german domain anyway, 
  no country has the same influence in eu as germany . 
  this is their economic reich . 
  how comes german marks converted to euro currency 's first value with almost 1:1 ratio ? 
  now people wonder why germany has the most powerful economy and exportations in all eu by far , while other countries got a massive stop of exportation because of higher value of their new currency at the time . 
  and that was just the beginning, 
  `` fragole di bosco '' is litterally `` woodland strawberries '' , while `` fragole selvatiche '' = `` wild strawberries '', 
  `` fragole di bosco '' or `` fragole selvatiche '', 
  probably the most common woodland fruits here,
