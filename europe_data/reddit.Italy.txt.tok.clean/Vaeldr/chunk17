  rome and the italian peninsula were attacked an devastated by those very same tribes who got citizenship of rome . 
  the vandals ( conquered germanic tribe ) set rome on fire * twice * . 
  goths and lombards were the ones who destroyed the roman empire . 
  but they had been citizens of rome . 
  bye bye rome , hello middle ages . 
  well are we describing 1940 's america as multicultural ? 
  i think it 's pretty clear how things were back then and different cultures were all but not equal . 
  also as i said in another comment from the moment the japanese bombed pearl harbor they were doomed . 
  why ? 
  americans and europeans ( the wehrmacht and the italian army included ) had guns that were vastly superior to any japanese weapons at the time . 
  emperor caracalla gave roman citizenship to everyone in the romans empire . 
  that was about the same time when barbarians started actually winning stuff . 
  in the end these same barbarians who had become romans were the ones to burn rome to the ground ( yes i am mostly referring to germanic barbarians ) . 
  they were accepted into the roman armies , and they were the ones who conquered italy , eliminating the empire . 
  learn from history , they say . 
  well japan was and is pretty homogeneous . 
  east asian cultures are alike but that does n't make them any less homogeneous . 
  also you ca n't compare europe to africa , to asia or to america ( which became great * after * europeans settled there ) . 
  you ca n't compare europe 's success to anyone 's simply because we are hardly in the same category . 
  but let me ask you this : other countries , especially from east asia started catching up with us . 
  since when ? 
  we were light years ahead of them before ww2 , that 's for sure . 
  because europeans were to be feared . 
  nobody dared to fuck with europeans , or as much speak a bad word . 
  because europeans ruled the world . 
  you may say that countries like japan and china were never colonized , but they were still de facto ruled by europeans . 
  so when did we turn from the masters of the earth that everyone feared to the bunch of pussies who can barely protect themselves that we are now ? 
  about the same time we started being tolerant and multicultural . 
  well rome was n't multicultural all the time . 
  when romans were romans and the bosses of everything and everyone the empire succeeded . 
  when everyone , roman by birth or not , became roman , the empire started it 's way to self-destruction . 
  the byzantine empire is imo more greek than it is roman . 
  and the japanese empire arguably still exists today . 
  they had the misfortune of getting into a fight with people who were well ahead of them . 
  in a war that was in absolutely no way suited for their capabilities .

  these are just the discussion threads i found in about 2 minutes . 
  there are probably more , not to mention all the articles on immigration which also inspire a debate and you can see the general opinion of / r/europe . 
  as for my contribution : the way i see it , it has been an epic fail and although some good things have come out of it they are vastly overwhelmed by the bad things . 
  but it is to be expected : throughout history there is not a single empire or country that multiculturalism has n't ruined . 
  this is exactly why the roman empire fell and the japanese empire succeeded : japan was homogeneous . 
  yes you are right . 
  the manifesto is well written . 
  especially like the part `` to the italian reader '' . 
  two small pages , and yet so good at manipulating you using some sane arguments and tingling your patriotism . 
  really ? 
  i do n't know if you 've read das kapital but i do n't appreciate the writing . 
  while the second and the third book are better made ( by engels on marx 's notes ) the first one is complete hell . 
  marx takes about fifty pages to express an idea that is easily explainable in one . 
  that produces a 1000 pages book which gets boring at some point . 
  yeah , that 'd be horrible.but then again it 's better than getting a loan that enslaves you for years ahead just to move out . 
  italians are reeeeal practical . 
  damn , why is dawn so popular with nazis these days ? 
  damn . 
  i wish i lived in the world you have heard described :d . it exists but i would n't say it 's massive . 
  anyway i have always seen france as kind of a closer place to italy . 
  but whatever , we 're still close to spanish people . 
  well okay . 
  i just do n't wan na sound offensive or anything so i apologize in advance first of all i find the lifestyles completely different . 
  first things first : simple things like discipline . 
  i see italians as much more disciplined people . 
  or at least such have been my personal experiences . 
  the way of life is imo much different , seeing as most people 's lives are concentrated around doing something . 
  spanish people have the `` why is there no fiesta ( literally have heard that question ) '' attitude . 
  being friendly and family matters . 
  spanish people just seem so much more friendly and care so much more about their family . 
  maybe your girlfriend had an exceptional family which i 'm happy to hear but most families these days are so split and always in conflict . 
  also italians seem to have more of an `` mind your own business attitude '' . 
  you have no idea how long it 's been since i last had a big family get together . 
  the people kind of look different . 
  i do n't mean physically but more of what everyone looks concerned with . 
  the fact that languages are close goes without saying , but the way i see it there are more different things than alike . 
  same goes for greek people who have tried to convince me that we are basically the same people . 
  my experiences are very limited and i may be very wrong , but these are the conclusions i 've drawn . 
  so again to the main point . 
  what is it that you found so much in common ? 
  i am genuinely interested . 
  yeah , a far right xenophobic rally . 
  the russians are such barbarians . 
  that would never happen in a west european country . 
  well our gdp would become less than america 's i think . 
  hahahahaah . 
  i 've never heard anything more wrong in my entire lifetime . 
  calling red sauce bland is much similar to calling ferrari a shitty car . 
  pomodoro sauce is not only one of the most delicious sauces but also it 's very easy to make . 
  and we all know ragu ' is n't perfect ragu ' until you add some red to it . 
  pasta is a proud italian . 
  spaghetti al pomodoro is made with basilico with a reason . 
  it clearly says : green , red , white . 
  it proudly stands above us like out national flag , protecting people from hunger and sparing them time on hard to make sauces . 
  while carbonara looks like puke . 
  such as ? 
  also , it is important to mention which part of italy . 
  that 's the copy of spaghetti ai frutti di mare . 
  i disagree . 
  when i was little and my dad made me carbonara ( which was the only spaghetti he made ) he used to say `` we only ate this in the army so close your eyes and eat up like a man '' . 
  my hate for spaghetti alla carbonara is deep since then , and i never ever eat them . 
  best sauce is red sauce . 
  everyone knows that . 
  also , all yellow is the same .
