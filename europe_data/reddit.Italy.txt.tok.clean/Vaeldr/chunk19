  barbarians may have defeated rome 's sword but they never defeated rome 's soul . 
  most likely . 
  the romans classified northern italy as celtic . 
  the vast majority of slaves that the romans brought were celtic/germanic . 
  after the fall of the romans empire italy ( and especially the north ) was settled by germanic tribes , mostly goths , venetians and lombards . 
  throughout the middle ages italy ( again , especially the north ) was small states that just passed from hand to hand like coins . 
  much was in austria-hungary . 
  we had some time in the holy romans empire . 
  so yeah , that is most likely my ancestry . 
  the core of the italian population right now is romans + the germanic ( which were again lombards and goths ) tribes that settled the fertile padana valley . 
  so it 's safe enough to assume that 's the ancestry we have . 
  i have lombard and goth ancestry , okay ? 
  okay , okay . 
  i know this is mostly in the joke spectrum but i would actually love to know in what way italy has ever betrayed anyone . 
  in ww1 : italy , germany and austria-hungary had a defensive pact . 
  which would mean that if germany or austria got attacked we needed to help you . 
  however , you guys turned it from a defensive pact into an attacking one so we no longer felt bound to participate in you aggressive conquests . 
  so we fought on the side we saw as right . 
  in ww2 . 
  pietro badoglio took control over the kingdom of italy . 
  something german officers had tried but failed . 
  however if the germans had succeeded they would be `` heroes '' however we are traitors . 
  after the capitulation of the kingdom of italy the italian forces in russia and greece and yugoslavia were disarmed , their weapons were given to the nazis as a last act of friendship . 
  we capitulated but tried to help you with the little we had . 
  the italian soldiers were slaughtered on their way back to italy by the nazis . 
  maybe that is why we declared war on nazi germany . 
  not to mention that in 1943 mussolini announced repubblica di salo in northern italy . 
  while the americans and the southerners were advancing north , the germans and the northern italians were fighting back for two years . 
  brothers turned against brothers . 
  two fucking years . 
  for every village , for every field . 
  for a lost war . 
  with you . 
  eventually all of italy capitulated on the 27 april of 1945 , just a few days before germany with the death of mussolini . 
  we killed mussolini . 
  you died until the very end for hitler . 
  sorry for not sending our 13 year olds to fight and die for a lunatic , i guess . 
  i do n't know about asians but they surely did n't kill that many europeans . 
  they only had russia , belorus and ukraine of europe which were n't very populated zones . 
  so no , i 'm pretty sure they did n't kill more europeans . 
  on the other hand europeans colonized much of asia for hundreds of years . 
  in which they were killing plenty . 
  the mongols killed about 25 million people which is about the number ( well less by 8-10 million ) of asian people killed by europeans . 
  i guess that throughout it 's history asians killed the most asians . 
  but no the mongols alone . 
  anyway , europeans are heavyweight killing champions of the world . 
  who has killed the most asians ? 
  europeans . 
  who has killed the most africans ? 
  europeans . 
  who has killed the most middle easterners ? 
  europeans . 
  who has killed the most europeans ? 
  europeans . 
  we do n't judge you on how you were born . 
  we hate and kill everyone equally . 
  see ? 
  we were n't racist we were just killing other white people .

  fun days would limit to mostly these things : [ nutella on bread ] ( http://www.adonemagazine.com/sites/default/files/users/gilda%20furgiuele/inimagine.jpg ) or [ these biscuits ] ( http://www.grancaffevuotto.com/images/mulino_bianco_abbracci.jpg ) . 
  with milk . 
  you put the biscuit in the milk . 
  other than that a great day would limit to : a [ bike ] ( http://www.fahrradhaus.it/upload/getfile/uploadfiles/images/buben-aurora02-big.jpg ) , [ lego ] ( http://www.marketscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/lego.jpg ) , [ yu-gi-oh ] ( http://whsword.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/yugiohcards12.jpg ) , [ this beautiful game ] ( http://www.pool-and-snooker.com/tables/football-tables/mini-football-table.jpg ) . 
  and last but not least . 
  [ football ] ( http://www.pacificyouthsoccer.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/children-soccer.jpg ) . 
  ^ do n't ^ show ^ [ this ] ( http://travelcuts.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/kinder_egg1.jpg?w=300 ) ^ one ^ to ^ the ^ americans . ), 
  the reason for this is that the rich expat is probably going to contribute to the country a lot more . 
  going to a country when you are sent by your company or offered a job there and then possibly returning is completely different than settling to a country for ever with no clear idea of what you want to do there . 
  i did n't find it all that bad . 
  bbq from the south slavs is the best bbq you can ever have . 
  most of the traditional food looks awful but tastes great . 
  from what i know it 's called popara and it looks disgusting . 
  it 's name also sounds disgusting . 
  but it 's pretty good actually . 
  and i 'm not sure why op said that 's tea . 
  from what i know it 's just hot water , not herbs or anything . 
  as it should be . 
  why do n't we vote for rules or something ? 
  for example you put a one week warning there will be voting ahead . 
  then you open a mod thread with proposed new rules and keep it up for two weeks so most people who come often can vote . 
  you post each proposed rule as a comment and do n't let anyone else put comments . 
  agreeing with the new rule would need a like , disagreeing a dislike or something . 
  in order to not affect the karma of the mod who posts the new proposals maybe the new proposed rules can be posted by a bot . 
  and all the rules that get an overwhelming majority of upvotes can be accepted . 
  in order to not strip the mods of their power too much new rules can be proposed in 2 ways : by mods . 
  if people message the mods and the mods approve that the rule is interesting enough to be voted on by us . 
  i know it kinda ruines guideline 2 but this could be an exception . 
  that way the people will decide how the subreddit is ruled . 
  i 'm sorry but if you put a little thought into it both sentences are the exact same thing except one sounds fancier . 
  most of the eastern europeans i see integrate fairly well . 
  very well , some are just like natives . 
  the same can not be said about non-european immigrants . 
  the way i see it a second generation eastern european is already a full on italian whilst other immigrants ( especially those who come from muslim countries ) massively refuse to integrate . 
  not only that but the second generation arabs are even more far away from this country than their parents . 
  what is more ( and i think this is a result of communism ) eastern europeans have a very strong feeling of work and labor and duty , unlike certain other groups . 
  some people do n't actually think it 's in europe due to the fact that it 's located in the caucasus mountains with happens to be the border of europe . 
  the capital is tbilisi . 
  they used to be part of the ussr and had tensions with russia . 
  i remember russian tanks there . 
  much like the russians they are orthodox christians .
