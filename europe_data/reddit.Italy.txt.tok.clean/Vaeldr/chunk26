  the rights is again their fault . 
  they should n't have sold them . 
  of course europeans will want to buy them . 
  we do that in europe-for example the italian enel owns a big deal of electric centrals in europe and america . 
  they even own 92 % of spain 's largest energy producer ( which leads to the questions why italians pay so much for electricity but whatever ) . 
  i do n't see slovenia and slovakia living in hunger . 
  they should start owning them . 
  or increase taxes on foreign owners or something . 
  or a politics of protectionism , i do n't know ** something ** . 
  of course the west wants to control african politics . 
  the west tries to control western , eastern , southern and all kinds of leaders . 
  it 's a matter of politics . 
  the fact that they do it means nothing . 
  brain drain ? 
  from africa ? 
  i see how we can talk about brain drain from europe , and especially eastern europe , but from africa ? 
  it 's not about being whacked . 
  it 's about being unable . 
  if you ask me africa will be best if they stopped trying to be like us ( countries , politics ) and just go back to the things they culture originally had-living in tribes . 
  we should n't have pushed them to the modern era as we did-look at what happened now . 
  it 's the same reason we do n't let kids vote-we ca n't give them responsibility they are n't ready for . 
  well if the aliens have been around for as long as us on our planet it 's our own fault we were n't advanced enough to fight them back . 
  the killing of africans has passed . 
  i said the people who lived there back in the day suffered but that no longer has any impact . 
  dividing our countries ? 
  we already have established countries . 
  when we went to africa there were no countries . 
  the harvesting of resources and the controlled head of state is just bullshit . 
  that 's stupid propaganda , we do n't so that . 
  we buy their resources at costs they set for them . 
  with a continent as rich as africa i do n't understand how they do n't all live in piles of gold . 
  i did n't expect italy to have used so little to be honest . 
  not giving ideas , but could you sue them for this scene ? 
  i mean it can drive away potential tourists or something . 
  plus it 's giving the country a shitty reputation . 
  some slovakians were really mad about that hostel movie . 
  tobacco is taxed . 
  smokers are n't . 
  i think you did n't get the sarcasm of my comment . 
  i placed it with the same possibility as colonizing space with mutant baby squirrels from the moon . 
  depends on weather you 're willing to sacrifice all your valuables . 
  i will . 
  i 'm the guy who thinks that it 's 3rd world countries ' own fault they have problems and that immigrants should go back from where they came from and try to fix things . 
  same is valid for italy . 
  succeed or die trying . 
  the jokes about italian corruption have a point . 
  that is why i added loyal and highly paid ( so they do n't actually need bribes to survive ) . 
  italy can be disciplined and nice , it just takes a strong hand to do it . 
  an iron fist if you like . 
  italy has been very disciplined and nice for a long time . 
  sadly that iron fist has been missing for 20 years now . 
  but that will change in time . 
  you have my word for it . 
  actually that is logical . 
  but i do n't think that saving a little on pensions is worth the life or health of people . 
  well according to the native americans we were gods . 
  like literally . 
  i guess the africans must have took it in similarly . 
  which can be fought with a strong , loyal and highly payed police force and a working , severe justice system . 
   i would generalize that to `` stop extremist violence '' . 
  islam is just one cover extremists use to justify hurting people . 
  islam gives birth to extremism . 
  it 's an extremist and dangerous religion and it should be treated on equal ground as nazism . 
   also known as cleaning up the mess that colonialism left behind . 
  do n't go there . 
  colonialism was bad for the people who lived back then but it 's good for today 's africa . 
  look at all the technology we brought them . 
  we basically spared them work for thousands of years . 
  imagine aliens come here . 
  they can do bad shit to us but they also give us technology to travel stars and reach light speed and increase our lives . 
  on top of that they keep aiding us long after they 've left us alone . 
  sounds like a good deal to me . 
  so yeah , we did that for them . 
  colonialism is an excuse . 
  besides with all the steps we spared them , how long does it take to get your shit back together ? 
  oh wait , shit in africa was never together . 
  i think i 'll even do a cmv on the subject . 
  hopefully it stays like this . 
  actually that 's a good idea . 
  seeing as smokers are more likely to use the healthcare system anyway we should tax them more . 
  same goes for fat people . 
  although 1 % per pack is a bit too much . 
  but no , take a years spending on cigarettes and tax the person like 5 % of the money he spent on smokes . 
  it will reduce smoking ** and ** give us money . 
  i like you sir . 
  haters gon na hate . 
  props to you . 
  you found the one that is the most likely to happen among the four . 
  there are four equally possible things we can do within our lifetimes . 
  integrate the roma . 
  stop muslim violence . 
  civilize africa colonize space using mutant baby squirrels from the moon . 
  globalusm is bad because when two cultures meet , eventuall , one destroys the other . 
  the eu exist so european countries do not get pushed around by global forces . 
  let us establish what you need to try to be in the eu . 
  territory in europe . 
  european culture.population that mostly lived in europe . 
  they are not europeans . 
  the fact that they have european culture is not enough for it is one out of three factors necessary . 
  globalism is stupid .
