  the eu is for europeans . 
  it 's not just a name . 
  it 's a union of europeans . 
  we ca n't just add all of the fucking world in the eu . 
  that defeats the purpose of the eu-being a power that can be competitive . 
  continent . 
  russia : most of russia 's population is european . 
  russia 's culture is european . 
  russia has 2/3 components to try and join the eu . 
  turkey does n't have one . 
  why would non-europeans join the fucking european union ? 
  are you retarded ? 
  it 's a damn european union . 
  the un is for the whole world . 
  how can you not comprehend this simple concept ? 
  greenland is oversea territory of denmark and it 's population is insignificant . 
  definition is pretty strict . 
  the ural mountains , the caucas mountains , the mediterranean , the bosphorus , the atlantic , the northern sea . 
  you have to be part of europe to be part of the *** european *** union . 
  do you not see why this is necessary ? 
  yeah but you have to be at least partly in europe ** and ** have a mostly european ( living in europe ) population ** and ** have european culture . 
  you have to be fit in at least 3 of the conditions to even try to be in the eu . 
  both australia and turkey fail on two of them . 
  european culture is n't enough . 
  you have to have an almost entirely european population as well and turkey has neither . 
  no , i just think that cultures should be distinguished and not mixed too much in order to preserve their integrity . 
  right , which belong to european countries with european culture . 
  the geographical qualification is wrong and badly done . 
  if turkey is in i 'd like to see my country out please . 
  no , point is for european nations to unite in order to stand a chance in a global competition against everyone else . 
  against the usa , china . 
  europe as one , so we can stand our ground . 
  similar unions are taking place in africa and asia with the same purpose . 
  if we accept , say , china we are defeating the whole purpose of the eu and are going to be thrown around all the time . 
  right , except this is the eu . 
  you know , the * european * union . 
  by your logic we should accept japan in the eu-they qualify in every way . 
  at least they have european ( greek ) culture . 
  too bad they are n't in europe . 
  yeah , everyone is trying to bring some `` if '' or `` maybe '' . 
  democracy is a system where throughout a set period of time , people get to chose the people who rule them according to their ideas without engaging in any violent actions . 
  that is democracy . 
   do you think there 's a democratic system ( as in terms of voting ) preferable over others ? 
  yes . 
  you get to chose . 
  in italy 's case you get to chose who 's going to fuck you up . 
   do you think europe can be more democratic ? 
  according to the definition of democracy it already is democratic . 
   do you consider the eu a democracy ? 
  it is such by definition . 
  how dare you not have a home ? 
  well i was confused when i saw your downvotes too but youknow , it 's how the internet work . 
  i upvoted you if that 's of any consolation . 
  i think i can answer this one . 
  for the record i would never and have never voted for him . 
  so berlusconi is a very influential person . 
  his propaganda is in every house . 
  the owns mediaset who enlarge his influence on italians 100 times . 
  owning such a huge media network is huge . 
  he is super rich , and when you hear him talk he actually sounds like he wants to do something good for italy . 
  berlusconi also gathers every person that is a bit rightist . 
  because the other main choice is a leftist party who basically want to give citizenship to everyone born in italy and other stupid shit like that , people on the right go for him . 
  he has very nice offers . 
  he promises things such as the removal of certain taxes but he never does . 
  or if he does he just replaces them with other , equal taxes . 
  but people believe him . 
  due to berlusconi i start agreeing with some ancient geek phillisophers-people in charge of countries should not be given any private property . 
  i 'm not a fan of the idea but berlusconi makes me reflect . 
  if he was n't so rich , italy would n't be in seep shit right now . 
  yup . 
  you see , i 'm not saying he has to give a fuck about italy . 
  i do n't care if he does . 
  the guy is was a kid when fucking mussolini was in charge . 
  but leave italy alone for god 's sake . 
  you know , i just do n't get it . 
  i do n't get berlusconi . 
  i understand some people , evil people who did horrible things . 
  i understand mussolini and hitler . 
  they may have been evil but they had an ideology and were people who loved their countries . 
  they thought they were doing it for the good of their nations . 
  yes , he may have been a murderer but he wanted glory and a big empire , to be remembered for ever . 
  he believed in an ideology , he wanted to change the world for the better . 
  he was a vicious criminal , but he did it , in his eyes , in the name of the chinese people . 
  i understand the slave owners-yes , they were evil , but in their minds they though they were doing the right thing by exploring some people for the benefit of others . 
  these are all bad people . 
  but they stood up for something . 
  their twisted logic made them to believe they are good people . 
  because the way i see it everyone wants to be good , even if they turn out evil . 
  but berlusconi ? 
  i do n't understand him . 
  i just do n't . 
  why ? 
  how can he do this to his own nation ? 
  has he no shame ? 
  i can not describe him . 
  i do not see any kind of logic in him or his supporters . 
  i mean okay , the supporters-they may be stupid . 
  but him ? 
  he 's not stupid ... 
  i truly believe berlusconi is worse than hitler .
