  gets kind of annoying when you have to listen to the same voice of the dubbing actor in every movie but at least it promotes italianness . 
   what is the basis of these claims ? 
  first of all i think we can all agree that alexander the great is greek ( macedonians claim he 's macedonian ) . 
  so that 's not the beginning of their nation . 
  i ca n't speak for the serbian arguments . 
  anyway once upon a time khan asparuh made bulgaria . 
  later bulgaria became a big country , the biggest on the balkans and of the strongest in europe . 
  they fought against the byzantium empire and won many times . 
  during these times macedonia was always a part of bulgaria ( then again so was most of serbia and romania so that 's not a huge argument ) . 
  but unlike serbia , macedonia never really had wars with the bulgarians . 
  it always seemed they were part of bulgaria unlike the serbs who were often at war with bulgaria . 
  later the bulgarian king samuil ( who macedonians now call `` sam ** o ** il ) had his capital in ohrid . 
  he has a good story google him , it 's interesting . 
  anyway he was a bulgarian king , his capital was in today 's macedonia . 
  but then , the really big thing came . 
  bulgarians were enslaved by the ottomans . 
  in the 1800 's the ottoman empire made a map showing which regions were inhabited by indigenous bulgarian population - [ here 's the map ] ( http://lambo.blog.bg/photos/29038/original/bulgarian%20land.png ) . 
  so that is where the fist real claim about macedonia ( and parts of serbia and greece and romania ) comes from . 
  later the russians as you very well know liberated bulgaria and made the [ san stefano treaty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_san_stefano ) in which bulgaria still included a lot more lands than it has today . 
  here is bulgaria of [ 1878 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/bulgaria-sanstefano_-%281878%29-bytodorbozhinov.png ) later in berlin the great powers gathered to decide the future of the new country . 
  the conference started with otto von bismarck saying : `` today we are gathered here not to think about the happiness of the bulgarians , but to discuss our own interests . '', 
  this conference resulted in cutting bulgarian land leaving it only a small autonomous country giving land to the neighbors and this was the [ result ] ( http://www.sbv.hit.bg/images/4-3.jpg ) . 
  they did n't want a strong country on the balkans under russia 's influence-who can blame them ? 
  the cutting of the land was `` the national question '' . 
  today many of these lands are still not in bulgaria ( including macedonia ) . 
  what we are sure of is that by the 1900-1930 macedonians described themselves as bulgarians . 
  the serbian rulers did many things to wipe out this bulgarian feeling in macedonians , including changing the used alphabet . 
  today many of the people macedonians consider as their revolutionaries though of themselves as bulgarians - misirkov and gotse delchev . 
  they are macedonians as much as alexander the great is one . 
  they died in bulgaria and though of themselves as such . 
   but can we really say that macedonian is just a `` dialect '' of bulgarian or serbian ? 
  yes . 
  macedonian is almost the same as bulgarian . 
  as i am a person who speaks bulgarian i ca assure you there almost no difference . 
  the ` awakening '' of the macedonian nation is the creating of them as a nation-one they have never been before the 1940 's . 
   was `` macedonia '' as an idea created by the yugoslav republic to troll bulgaria ? 
  yes . 
  i 'm sorry but yes . 
  it 's the truth . 
  especially tito . 
  now , what i have stated and provided maps and documents for is absolute historical facts . 
  you can decide on your own if they are sufficient . 
  if i 'm not clear with anything i would be delighted to answer your questions and enter a discussion as long as it 's civilized . 
  sadly domestic violence in italy is on the rise so it 's a good thing to try and fight discrimination but i have the feeling someone will take this too far . 
  i can assure you that is not the case in macedonia . 
  what 's the difference between a catholic priest and acne ? 
  acne waits until you 're 13 to cum on your face . 
  totally relevant since obviously the consent age there is 12 . 
  by the way why is there an age of consent there anyway ? 
  i though catholic priests ca n't have sexual intercourse ... 
  we will fuck your motherfucking homosexual asses ' . 
  so heterosexual of you !!, 
  berlusconi , a true protector of law and order in italy and the world , bliss his courageous name . 
  are you british or american ? 
  i 'm glad that the allies won the war but just for the record if it was n't for the ussr we 'd all have pictures of hitler in our workplaces . 
  how is germany not a sovereign country ? 
  my english is pretty bad so i fear i have obviously mistaken the meaning of the word `` sovereign '' . 
  should n't you be like `` zis ist not fu *** ng funny '', 
  [ do n't ignore the germans-you know what happened last time you angered them ] ( http://humanrightsgroup.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/londonbombedwwii_full.jpg ), 
  10/10 would live in . 
  i though it was invented by some american guy ... george washington carver ? 
  you could n't let him have it , huh ? 
  anyway peanut butter is not that hard to find in bigger shops . 
  i 'm pretty sure they had it in lidl . 
  maybe they stopped importing it . 
  anyway , nobody buys it because we have nutella and peanut butter is disgusting ( in my opinion ) . 
  but it 's possible to find i think . 
  sadly we hear of him . 
  name a canadian product and i 'll tell you if we have it . 
  you win this time . 
  oh i get it now . 
  cause we 're like mafia and stuff . 
  yeah . 
  i 'll have you know that in the part of italy i inhabit there has never been mafia and i can assure you that the only real mafia in bulgaria is the politicians . 
  not sure what i should make of this . 
  1 ) i hoped italy would win that one . 
  do we even do it ? 
  2 ) humanity is lazy . 
  i 'm kind of scared that we 're gon na be driven around by machines . 
  i know i sound old-fashioned but damn , i wan na drive around . 
  i do n't get it ... 
  highly unlikely . 
  the crisis is now pretty much over , now we 're on our way up . 
  now 's the time to rebuild . 
  the worst has passed ^ i ^ hope ^ so, 
  in what way was i beaten ? 
  auch ... you 're an asshole . 
  it 's europa in italian so ... there you go . 
  plus add evropa for some slavic countries . 
  not a bad idea although i do n't see a point in it . 
  you can learn how europe is in all languages easily . 
  not yet it is n't . 
  on the balkan peninsula 2 . 
  a lot of immigrants from there to italy 3 . 
  they are mostly muslims . 
  they speak a language that has nothing to do with the southern slavic languages ( serbian , bulgarian ) or with greek . 
  they had a pretty strict communistic leader enver hoxha who tried to make the atheists . 
  we 're usually with the expression the country sucks but people who go there enjoy it . 
  they have a lot of rocks .
