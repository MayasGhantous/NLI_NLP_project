  i never said stupid . 
  there is a huge difference between stupid and uneducated . 
  i love that every time people do n't agree they just say `` racism '' and it 's like they won the argument . 
  is it not true that ** you ** brought the africans from africa as slaves ? 
  historical facts , my friend-not racism . 
  would you please fuck off now ? 
  here we go again with the `` every single one '' argument . 
  not everyone was obviously . 
  generally , yes , they were . 
  those who were n't criminals were poor uneducated people . 
  the rest were the slaves brought from africa . 
  maybe there was 100 guys who were rich and went there or something . 
  jokes aside . 
  if this would happen it would n't be a one way street right ? 
  it would mean that europeans can go to north america as well . 
  europe 's native population is on a massive decline and demographic crisis . 
  the last thing we need is more people running away . 
  on the other side we sure as hell do n't need a foreigners who have a very different life style than ours ( i mean that ** is ** why their ancestors went to america in the first place , right ? ) . 
  we do n't need our criminals ( or their descendants ) back . 
  nor do we need a bunch of former slaves . 
  also look at our situation-you get all the immigrants from romania , bulgaria , poland which is bad for both the country that receives immigrants and the one who gives them out . 
  because these countries lose citizens and we have to get people with totally different ideas and life style . 
  it would be the same just bigger and worse . 
  maybe first we should fix our problems in the eu and then think about americans . 
  when we sent them there ( or they went ) i do n't think anyone wanted them here . 
  why would that be different ? 
  the fact that your friend is out of job or something does n't mean he can just come here . 
  am i right that he is probably of italian descent immigrant to america ? 
  with all the economical problems that italy has right now plus the high unemployment the last thing we need is someone just coming back and taking the job of some local dude or even worse-feeding off our welfare system . 
  he should have though when he left his country-now he can fuck himself for all i care . 
  edit : capitalize some letters . 
  i did n't believe the day would come when even serbs would lose their balls ... 
  gypsies-you could give them money but they will still make gypsy things ( architecture ) .

  so great job romania looks like you integrated them . 
  well france , your turn . 
  really ? 
  stupidity at it 's finest ... 
  i 'm not as much bringing it . 
  i 'm just saying that countries with financial issues are n't culturally inferior and that it 's a stupid question . 
  what ? 
  i 'm ready to bet that italy has been pretty relevant after the renaissance . 
  in both good and bad ways . 
  are you saying that people like alessandro volta are irrelevant ? 
  like enrico fermi ? 
  as a matter of fact ( and this is a bad thing ) fascism was made in italy . 
  are you saying this is irrelevant ? 
  i mean what is your definition of a `` relevant '' country ? 
  which country is relevant ? 
  and it is exactly our history that makes our culture . 
  when a country has no history it probably does n't have any culture either . 
  i think that saying nations such as greece and italy are culturally inferior goes much further than stupidity . 
  i mean , you do realize that that 's where democracy was made and firstly used ? 
  and like the renaissance and shit . 
  furthermore as i have said multiple times this is temporary . 
  not so long ago germany was in crisis while italy was the fastest growing european economy . 
  tables have turned and that is natural . 
  there is not a cultural difference-just a temporary situation . 
  it 's not even hard working / lazy nation . 
  it 's just the way it is right now . 
  well you see after the fall of the roman empire the north was taken over by germanic and gallic tribes . 
  also the north has been part in the holy roman empire which on it 's self helped the mixing of the genes . 
  the blond and blue eyes is complete bullshit . 
  as a son of a blond woman and having an aunt that is a redhead ( together with quite a few cousins ) and coming from a whole green-eyed family on the side i think that saying italians are dark is rather funny . 
  i think that this goes for spain and portugal as well , although not as much . 
  as i am obviously not familiar with the history of every european country i ca n't speak for all . 
  but from those i know italians ( especially the north ) have really mixed genes . 
  i mean there are slavs , germanics , darker ones ( hispanics i guess ) , french . 
  this is due to the nature of italy that is really nice so it attracted various tribes to move in . 
  bossi is a complete idiot who is trying to separate our nation . 
  it is true that we have a little different genetic material but that is irrelevant since we speak the same language ( regardless of the dialect ) , we have the same culture . 
  people died for us to be together , strong and united . 
  bossi is pathetic . 
  nah we really do that . 
  but i have to say this picture is n't really accurate . 
  i for once touch my thumb with only the index and the middle finger . 
  the pinky and the other one stay closed in a fist . 
  hahaha what a bunch of fascist and nazi bastards ... oh wait ... 
  the latino thing is pretty bothering . 
  we are n't into that category . 
  actually if you learn about our history northern italians are closer to germans than to anyone else as genetics . 
  i do n't really see what we have to do with arabs . 
  sure they conquered spain so maybe there goes the conviction for spain . 
  but us ? 
  i mean , yeah , the south was ruled by arabs but it was also ruled by normans . 
  everyone seems to miss that . 
  and the northe has nothing to do with arabs . 
  true that . 
  these people are complete idiots . 
  you made me laugh . 
  i like you . 
  well it was yugoslavia . 
  italy . 
  no , we have nothing to do with spain . 
  really damn offensive . 
  i have nothing in common with mexico either i do not understand spanish and i have no idea what paella is . 
  also the whole looks of people thing . 
  when it 's a joke i do n't mind because i also make these kinds of jokes for other countries .
