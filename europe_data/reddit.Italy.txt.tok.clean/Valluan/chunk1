hmm , i wonder if when letta vaporised he left a puff of blood red mist behind . 
  he 's so frighteningly similar to frank underwood ( just think about the whole `` unions are useless '' deal , it strongly resembles some events of the first hoc season ) that i 'm starting to think he might have physically disposed of enrico letta . 
  that guy just vaporised into thin air .

   are you sure the beach-side success of salento is n't taking customers away from the crowded beaches in rimini , thus leaving the overall balance unchanged ? 
  living in salento , i can report that although the majority of summer tourists come here from southern italy ( mostly campania , naples and salerno ) , there 's a fairly large share of northern italians ( especially from piedmont and lombardy ) who come here instead of going to rimini and the whole riviera romagnola . 
  ** italy ** * italian politics might be corrupt and everything , but it sure is fun as hell . 
  for the first time in our republican history , on january 29th house speaker laura boldrini interrupted a filibuster led by m5s mps with the so-called `` guillotine '' : essentially , she automatically rejected all amendments to a particular decree and sent it to a vote that passed . 
  [ chaos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpmk-57tum4 ) [ ensued ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffipfn6govq ) . 
  the vote concerned a government decree to sell off about 7 billion euros of central bank gold and had been held up for days by the anti-establishment 5-star movement in effort to time it out . 
  during the brawl , an mp of the centrist party civic choice ( scelta civica , sc ) [ hit 5-star mp loredana lupo with his elbow ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdo73w_0rhi ) and later apologised . 
  5-star mp massimo felice de rosa allegedly entered a committee room and yelled `` you democratic party women are only here because you 're good at blowjobs '' ; he was later reported to the authorities and reprimanded by the house speaker . 
  on january 30th , as an act of protest against the new electoral law which is being planned by the democratic party and berlusconi 's go italy !, 
  party , 5-star mps occupied at least two parliamentary committees . 
  on thursday evening , president of the republic giorgio napolitano commented that he 's worried about the heated debate in the lower house . 
  on friday , 5-star movement beppe grillo asked lower house speaker laura boldrini to resign and one of his mps wrote on his facebook wall that she 's a woman without dignity , unworthy of consideration and a zombie . 
  after meeting his mps in rome , grillo tried to tone harsh criticism down , but then clashed against prime minister letta when he said that m5s 's actions could n't be tolerated any longer . 
  * m5s presented an impeachment petition against president of the republic giorgio napolitano . 
  it 's unlikely anything will happen , but it 's still relevant . 
  on tuesday , a 5-star mp compared napolitano to an executioner ( * boia * ) who cuts the throats of the oppositions , sparking general uproar over the use of such a strong language ( fascists loved that word ) . 
  * car group fiat announced its new name , fca ( fiat chrysler automobiles ) ; the company will be headquartered in the netherlands but it 'll have fiscal residence in the uk .

  * amanda knox and raffaele sollecito were found guilty of manslaughter by the appeal court and sentenced to 28 years and 6 month and 25 years of prison respectively . 
  this trial was a re-run of the previous one , since the acquittal sentence was invalidated by the supreme court .

  i know , right ? 
  i really hope it gets heavily modified while examined by the constitutional affairs committee , but i doubt that 's going to happen . 
  ** italy ** * talks over a new electoral system continue , after bits of the last one ( labeled `` porcata '' by its own creator , hence the name * porcellum * , `` pigsty '' ) were found unconstitutional by the constitutional court in december 2013 . 
  following last week 's controversial meeting between renzi ( mayor of florence and freshly appointed as secretary of the main centre-left party partito democratico , pd ) and berlusconi ( the convicted , expelled-from-senate leader of forza italia , fi , the main centre-right party ) , renzi presented a draft of the new electoral law : proportional method with run-offs in case no one reaches 35 % ; closed , short lists ( 4 to 6 candidates for each electoral district ) ; 5 % threshold for parties inside coalitions , 8 % for single lists , 12 % for coalitions ; 18 % max . 
  majority bonus to coalitions obtaining relative majority ( 35 % ) . 
  renzi also called for the end of the so called * bicameralismo perfetto * ( in italy the two chambers have the exact same role and power ) , turning the senate into a house of regions . 
  m5s ( grillo 's movement/party ) , other currents inside pd itself and parts of the public opinion heavily criticised both renzi 's decision to negotiate with berlusconi and the outcoming draft deeming it unconstitutional , as several constitutional lawyers already warned . 
  journalist giovanni sartori , the man who came up with the name * porcellum * for the previous law , called this one * pastrocchium * , meaning `` botch '' , `` pigswill '' . 
  pd 's president gianni cuperlo , one of the most passionate internal critics of the draft resigned after monday 's heated debate , stirring unease and confusion over a supposed breakup of the party . 
  on the other hand , the draft received enthusiastic support from ( obviously ) berlusconi and its party . 
  alfano , berlusconi 's former heir apparent and now leader of the ncd party , is still * en garde * but tends to support the act . 
  prime minister enrico letta ( pd as well , but not renzi 's same current ) said he 'd rather have a law with open lists , but renzi replied `` it 's ok only if everybody agree '' . 
  * former pm silvio berlusconi , together with his lawyers/mps pietro longo and niccol\u00f2 ghedini and 42 other people , [ are being investigated for witness tampering ] ( http://ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/english/2014/01/23/berlusconi-lawyers-probed-alleged-witness-corrupti_9951686.html ) . 
  apparently , during the ruby-affair trial berlusconi regularly paid large quantities of money ( several thousands of euros in fact ) to the girls who were his `` guests '' during his crazy parties in order to convince them to deny everything when called to testify . 
  * more depressing news about the economic crisis : [ poverty and unemployment are growing ] ( http://ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/english/2014/01/21/andor-says-poverty-growing-italy-well-unemployment_9936397.html ) , more than 12 % of employed italians can not afford to live on what they earn ( only greece and romania fare worse ) and according to a european commission report about employment , italy is the worst country to lose your job in , as chances of finding a new one in one year are about 14 % . 
  * as another austerity-driven decision , the government is planning to sell large parts of poste italiane and enav , the former being state 's post office company and the latter being a public air traffic agency . 
  the sale of the stake in poste italiane could yield as much as $ 4.8 billion .

  sorry i missed that by a thousand miles ... 
  i do n't have any doubt you can find both kinds in northern italy , as i can find both kinds in southern italy as well . 
  anyway , i 'm merely reporting what a pizza maker told me . 
   italians have a fatalistic attitude to life . 
  they know italian politics is corrupt , and berlusconi is a buffoon , they know they 're smothered in red tape . 
  but why bother too much about it ? 
  there 's little they can do personally . 
  is that a fantastic attitude ? 
  oh boy ... that 's why we 're stuck in the 20th century ... 
  well , it 's not totally the same . 
  the dough is actually quite different . 
  northern italian pizza tends to be thinner and crispier , while southern italian pizza is `` puffier '' and softer . 
  source : an italian pizza maker from vicenza ( if i recall correctly ) working in a pizzeria in kyoto , japan . 
  well , that 's not an excuse in my opinion . 
  he 's the president of freaking ecb , he 's expect to know his field of work . 
  if he does n't understand that derivatives are risky , why is he working in the field of economics in the first place ? 
  what 's worse is that some economists warned * ages ago * that the uncontrolled adoption of derivatives and market deregulation was dangerous for worldwide economy , so i guess he was among the people who deliberately * ignored * those warnings and dismissed them as socialist/communist propaganda . 
  probably . 
  i would n't be surprised . 
  for instance , in the case of italy , if mario draghi ( now president of the ecb ) did n't sign incredibly risky [ derivative contracts ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-06-26/italy-embroiled-latest-derivative-loss-fiasco-through-another-mario-draghi-headed-sc ) when he was director-general of the italian treasury ) , i do n't think italy would have met the requirements to adopt the euro . 
  and you know , draghi is n't exactly a minor , mostly unknown politician , so i would n't be surprised if other people knew about the issue and did n't act . 
  well , that probably happens in bigger cities ( milan , rome , florence , turin ... you know , the usual ones ) . 
  as for myself , i see both more bikes and the same number of cars . 
  if you live in a regional capital , where public transport is supposed to be good ( especially in northern italy ) then it 's logical for people to start ditching cars . 
  but if you 're not among those fortunate people you just have to keep using a car , as both public transport and infrastructure are just too uncomfortable to use ( where i live [ this ~ 60-year-old `` train '' ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:fse_ad_02.jpg ) takes about 1h10m to do 30km , and since about 90 % of the local railways are n't electrified there 's no other choice ) or simply non-existent . 
  the average internet connection here in italy is about 6-8 mbps down and a mere 384kbps up for $ 20-25 / month . 
  digital divide is still a prominent issue and in the areas with no copper broadband monthly fees can be even higher for generally lower speeds over hiperlan and wimax wireless connections . 
  needless to say , if you need to upload something heavy and do n't live in a fiber-served area , you have to : a ) upload it overnight , or b ) start uploading it early in the morning and let it continue throughout the day . 
  oh , and i forgot the mandatory thing : * pray it does n't just randomly disconnect while uploading * . 
  i 'm the maddest of you all . 
  $ 30/month ( including landline ) for this is utter bs . 
  sadly , you 're right . 
  here in italy many people found guilty in 1st grade trials decide to appeal the sentence and wait for the statute of limitations to kick in , so that they can get away safely from the law and pretend they were acquitted from all charges ( just like our dear b. and his family-controlled media corporations did many times in the past ) . 
   now , we have nepotism [ ... ] this . 
  in the italian dubbing scene , usually a male dubber marries a female dubber and their children are going to dub movies and tv shows since an early age . 
  this is why the quality of italian dubs is slowly declining and , being very interested in dubbing , it 's really sad to stay at the window and just watch , unable to do anything about it .
