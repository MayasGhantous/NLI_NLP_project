  oh so now everyday proofs are not a thing anymore ? 
  would you think that in a place in which sexism was a thing women could be executive chiefs ? 
  would husband beating their wives be in prison ? 
  would women be allowed to abort or divorce ? 
  no , that 's why our country is not sexist . 
  if you can not give me specific evident examples of why our country ( or yours ) is sexist , then i ca n't believe it is . 
  it 's just like my attitude towards religion : if i ca n't see it , i ca n't believe in it . 
  my attitude has never been sexist and , as you said , i 'm not stupid nor bad , so i could never treat a woman with less respect than a man just because of her gender . 
  never . 
  no , do n't tell me that i have n't realized it . 
  never . 
  i 've always been respectful to anyone who was respectful to me . 
  and i think that 's what society here wants us to be . 
  are there some mysoginist assholes ? 
  yes , but they are a minorance . 
  they 'll always exist , like neo-fascist will always exist . 
  but that does n't mean they represent our country in anyway . 
  if you ca n't call a nation `` fascist '' because there are `` some fascists '' , then you ca n't call a nation `` sexist '' only because there are some `` sexists '', 
   being poor or rich does not define you as importantly as your gender omg that 's one of the most retarded statements i 've read on this subreddit . 
  no woman here is discriminated by `` society '' the episodes of sexism here are private and isolated , and firmly punished by laws and institutions . 
  our women can have a career as much as our men . 
  it 's all a matter of whether they 're capable of doing it or less . 
  do you wan na see institutionalised sexism ? 
  then you might want to go to the middle east , where sexism is actually a problematic issue and women are actually discriminated . 
  want an example ? 
  my father works at a regional department and his boss is actually a woman . 
  my mother is the chief of the library she works in . 
  i ca n't believe in institutionalised sexism because i ca n't see any example in the place where i live ( which is the `` retrograde southern italy '' btw ) . 
  discrimination in society ? 
  in 2017 , in europe ? 
  do you really think that women are discriminated to day in france ? 
  there is no discrimination today in our society , especially not against women , and things like this law show why . 
  if you want to believe that `` old white males '' are the problem today , go on , get angry at your granpa or all the other white people ( so i guess all the french males , since the french ethnicity is white ) but do n't think to be on the right side , since you 're stating something wrong . 
  ... but if the assembly is full of white male ( or black women ) it does n't mean that the others were discriminated , but only that those white males/black women were more qualified/responded more to what the people wanted . 
  i 've eaten that `` pasticcio '' but did not like it too much : / your tsatsiki and feta are more than fine though , as well as souvlakis and pitas . 
  i live in apulia , and taranto was the capital of magna graecia . 
  i mean , we 've always been invaded by someone . 
  to make italy the north invaded the south , so i personally would n't feel that bad . 
  edit : on second thought , your alphabet is crazy pls let me speak italian i wan na eat my pizza, 
  translation for the non-latinists : `` greece , conquered , conquered the brutal winner . '', 
  [ referring to romans , ofc ], 
  southern italy is rightful greek clay ? 
  i want to join the argument . 
  our cheese is better ( ? ), 
  i loved spain ( even though i mostly went to catalogna ) , and spanish people ( and portuguese ) are weirdly similar to us italians . 
  but more exotic , more open to `` the ocean '' if you catch my drift . 
  when i went to ireland i said i wanted `` two beers '' at the bartender , making that gesture , and he looked at me kinda weirded out and offended . 
  i went home , i looked it up , and i understood . 
  fuck my italianism and my hand gestures , it was not the first time it gave me problems ... 
  we actually do n't have many swamps here in italy ... 
  but we have a lot of mosquitos anyway, 
  saw that . 
  i 'll look this up on the pc when i get home, 
   be me in 1850 . 
  italy ? 
  a country ? 
  ahahahahah yeah sure , and that stupid red shirts of the garibaldinians are really gon na defeat our powerful king ferdinand the second by promising our gullible farmers that he will give them the land they 're working in , so that they 'll start riots all over the kingdom mining its stability . 
  what a stupid idea . 
  fun fact : in italy we do n't use `` ettogrammo '' too much , except for when we 're buying prosciutto , or salame . 
  i do n't know why but we always ask for one/two/three `` etto/i di prosciutto '' at the butcher . 
  it 's latin actually . 
  `` subtilis '', 
  celts = / = normans, 
  lol u wish . 
  more like occupatio , am i right ? 
  i like being old . 
  old is the new new . 
  morocco was n't bombed . 
  apulia , the `` heel of the boot '' which is full of you germans on summer . 
  nice weather , best beaches and best oil in italy . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ remove ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ pineapple, 
  well , i 'm a native italian :d ^ ^ ^ want ^ ^ ^ sum ^ ^ ^ pizza ? 
  also because by this idea the only `` true , hyphen-less '' americans would be the natives . 
  which is partially true . 
  wow , do you really think that of us ? 
  because that 's extremely accurate . 
  that 's why he got elected . 
  i 've met a lot of them . 
  online , of course . 
  i 'm not partying for anyone ... 
  wait . 
  this makes no sense . 
  i live in bari , which is literally i front of albania : how can my water be so pure compared to its ? 
  pfft these fucking emigrants, 
  as an italian i 'm legitimately curious , what is that makes this office `` very italian '' ? 
  most of them do . 
  i am just wondering : if they want a `` black people '' safe space where they can be the dominating race why did they come to europe ? 
  : thinking :, 
  i do n't understand i feel like you were talking about another site , anon ... 
  i mean , barakokula . 
  i did . 
  oops . 
  i still think that turkey is european , though . 
  i think that the mentality and the history of the nation used to be a lot more european than in the other middle eastern countries . 
  i really hoped for them to join europe , but unfortunately they opted for a dictator ... 
  yeah , it 's that country next to sweden , the one where toblerone comes from . 
  shh !, 
  you 're not allowed to say that on this subreddit !, 
  went to germany ( bavaria ) , lots of italian tourists . 
  looks like we love each other , deep down in our hearts .
