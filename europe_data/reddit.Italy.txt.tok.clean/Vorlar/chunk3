  people are so entrenched in the belief that their own political views are infallible , they freak out when someone with an opposing world view bursts the bubble . 
  and you 're making disservice to yourself but pushing this idea of everything being russia 's fault . 
  not to mention that no one gives a damn about russia or china , people vote to solve their own local issues . 
  `` royals '' . 
  people with no power , say or real consequence kept as a national token , just like a pet . 
  truly royal position . 
  interesting . 
  you 're dismissing people based on their ethnicity . 
  i ca n't even begin to imagine what kind of logic is in your head behind this reasoning . 
  what 's your nationality and ethnicity by the way ? 
  put them on trains and ship with no stops directly to germany . 
  if merkel wants these people , she can have all of them . 
  same with anti-turkish and and-serb sources so do n't worry , you 're no unique in this . 
  the solution of the problem would be simple , germany just should stop inviting all of these people . 
  city 17 called , it wants its citadel back . 
  and yet for some reason we 're not allowed to just ship everyone coming to our shores directly to germany . 
   all those contries are developing while ukraine is recently developed/partially developed . 
  do n't think you understand the term [ developing country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/developing_country ) . 
  he 's a muslim . 
  of course there is nothing unusual in his words . 
  if he 'd start protecting lgbt people or act as a civilized human being , that would be unusual . 
  europe ? 
  sure , it 's the future . 
  not so much in case of european union though . 
  funny how no one who commented here seems to notice that there are 6 videos representing both sides of the * debate * the west treats russia unfairly \\ the west does not treat russia unfairly . 
  still everyone jumped the gun . 
  wonder of the op himself have n't even noticed this and simply read the first title or it 's deliberate to troll everyone in r/europe where most people never look past the headline . 
  again . 
  what 's your point ? 
  what are you saying should be done about it ? 
  [ yes , for real . 
  ] ( http://www.osce.org/odihr/83387?download=true ) and again . 
  one-sidedness of the arguments in this subreddit is astonishing . 
  what 's your point ? 
  years of propaganda and distorting reality does that to peoples perception of the world . 
  i suggest you to never learn about history in reddit commets , you will always get a distorted version of any given even that represents the autors biases . 
  what bout [ soviet famine of 1932 -- 33 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_famine_of_1932%e2%80%9333 )  unlike the previous famine of 1921 -- 22 , russia 's intermittent drought was not severe in the affected areas at this time . 
  [ 7 ]  some historians , such as robert conquest , claim that the government 's forced collectivization of agriculture as a part of the soviet union 's first five-year plan , forced grain procurement , and political repression in the countryside were the main reasons for the famine . 
  conquest , and others , additionally claim that the famine was a deliberate act of genocide against ethnic ukrainians , although some disagree . 
  [ 8 ] :507  historian mark b. tauger of west virginia university suggests that the famine was caused by a combination of factors , specifically low harvest due to natural disasters combined with increased demand for food caused by the collectivization , industrialization and urbanization , and grain exports by the soviet union at the same time . 
  [ 9 ]  a similar view was presented by stephen wheatcroft , who has given more weight to the `` ill-conceived policies '' of soviet government and highlighted that while the policy was not targeted at ukraine specifically , it was ukraine who suffered most for `` demographic reasons '' . 
  [ 10 ] i always find it interesting how in this sub everyone is so eager to `` protect '' anyone except serbs and russians . 
  even in this case . 
  the famine affected large areas of the ussr but it 's all ignored but ukraine . 
  and if you claim that it was all russians fault anyway ( like it 's a legitimate argument to ignore deaths of certain group of people ) , i suggest you to check [ who was in charge back then ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_stalin ) and look at his origins . 
  interesting how you 're not providing even a link to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgian_civil_war ) to back up your claims . 
  i guess because it might actually contain some factual information about the conflict which goes against your narrative . 
  so we 're calling it a protest now ? 
  interesting . 
  definition of [ protest ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/protest )   1 : a solemn declaration of opinion and usually of dissent : such asa : a sworn declaration that payment of a note or bill has been refused and that all responsible signers or debtors are liable for resulting loss or damageb : a declaration made especially before or while paying that a tax is illegal and that payment is not voluntary   2 : the act of objecting or a gesture of disapproval resigned in protest ; especially : a usually organized public demonstration of disapproval   3 : a complaint , objection , or display of unwillingness usually to an idea or a course of action went under protest   4 : an objection made to an official or a governing body of a sport definition of [ riot ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/riot )   archaic : profligate behavior : debaucheryb : unrestrained revelryc : noise , uproar , or disturbance made by revelers   2 : public violence , tumult , or disorderb : a violent public disorder ; specifically : a tumultuous disturbance of the public peace by three or more persons assembled together and acting with a common intent   3 : a random or disorderly profusion the woods were a riot of color   4 : one that is wildly amusing the new comedy is a riot, 
  inconsistency is one trait all career politicians share . 
  clinton or trump , i doubt there is any real difference for russia . 
  clinton changed her stance on relations with russia more than once . 
  i think trump is going to do the same . 
  however , i really hope the us and russia are going to be able to find any sort of common ground . 
  the nonsense of the last few years is getting way too far . 
  the ukrainian problem can be solved within a day but no one seems to be interested in it . 
   `` i said it was obsolete . 
  it 's no longer obsolete , '' where is is the word `` uninformed '' ? 
  you do realize that this remark was made after the member states actually agreed to start pulling their weight , right ? 
  his problem with nato was always about money . 
  fascinating how every opinion contrary to your own is an `` uneducated '' one . 
  also , what do you even know about trumps position on nato ? 
   lol that 's triple sweet . 
  but your right using high demand natural resources to force your politics in the neighborhood is something that never happen near russia borders and it 's just a smear campaign . 
  so ... no examples then . 
  edit : nope . 
  no examples indeed , just downvotes . 
  how benevolent . 
  poland just seeks a better future for all of the eu and a crappier one for russians . 
  totally has nothing to do with billions that can earn by the sheer virtue of having a pipeline going though your territory . 
  i wonder if poland decides to finally start pulling its own weight then , instead of just leeching money out of the rest of eu while smearing shit all over it all the time . 
   and no longer russia will be able to cut deliveries as a form of `` punishment '' . 
  as usual . 
  provide examples of this actually happening that later have n't turned out to be caused by your new besties , ukrainians . 
  yeah , here 's the thing . 
  they do n't want to assimilate . 
  for no reason ? 
  i guess the fact that he attacked me personally , instead of my position , is n't the reason enough . 
  i see poland wants to become a transit country for gas pipes going into the rest of eastern eu . 
  this explains a lot about their attitude towards russian-german pipeline . 
  business , nothing personal . 
  and here 's the pro-eu superstate warrior . 
  interesting post history , everything is up-voted and fit right into pro-eu \\ anti-trump narrative . 
  considering that you 're not even living in a country that is part of eu , this zealousness is quite disturbing . 
  are you one of those people in montenegro that dream about joining eu ~ ~ budget ~ ~ non stop ? 
  i especially like your comments where you 're counting money italy has to pay to eu and where you 're trying o convince italians that it 's only natural and these are not their own money anyway . 
  simple example . 
  is this subreddit pro-eu ? 
  yes it is !, 
  everyone who 's against the glorious eu superstate is supressed and agressively downvoted . 
   i am saying this subreddit is not a circlejerk is it because you 're part of the majority , maybe ? 
   you are ** objectively ** mistaken bold statement . 
  care to back it up with * objective * facts ? 
  are you saying this subreddit is n't one of the biggest circlejerks on reddit ? 
  as usual . 
  follow the narrative , label those who do n't follow it as shills . 
  i like how `` peace on the ** european continent ** '' is listed so high . 
  cold war \\ violet anti-ussr uprisings , transnistria war , kosovo , chechnya , now ukraine . 
  all of it took place in europe , conflicts never stopped but i guess those do n't count because it 's all those eastern barbaric countries fault anyway , right ?
