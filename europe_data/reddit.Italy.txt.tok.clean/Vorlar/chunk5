  oh and [ the numbers are overly inflated and rarely correspond to reality as well as allegations of ngo collusion with smugglers have little to no basis ] ( https://theintercept.com/2017/04/02/new-evidence-undermines-eu-report-tying-refugee-rescue-group-to-smugglers/ ) . 
  not to mention all of this was scrapped with the [ eu sanctioned triton ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_triton ) and frontex boats are no longer going anywhere near libya . 
  however , you can keep consuming your propaganda desperately looking for a scapegoat or reason why you should n't pull your weight in eu , it 's just easier to leech money of others , money you never earned and the only reason get is to keep you away from russian or chinese sphere of influence . 
  in case of ukraine it 's like having a severe heart disease and a few amputations but striving to become an astronaut . 
  it 's delusional . 
   i already acknowledged asking for quotas could be legal , and made points that it not really , you have n't . 
   stop changing your original posts and add sentences after i answerd to them . 
  it 's pathetic . 
  this was your entire post when you first submitted it : well . 
  as long as we 're at telling what other people should or should n't do : stop removing your original posts you 're apparently too embarrassed to show . 
  and this exchange is the prime example why i hope that brexit is inevitably going to lead to more secession . 
  it boggles my mind that we have to contribute a ton of money to eu budget , disregarding the fact that we have a ton of economical issues of our own , so that this money could go to countries that spend it on propaganda directed to smear us . 
  and for what ? 
  so that your government , that was [ all too happy to jump into bed with putin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_stream ) until stopped by the rest of eu , could avoid its responsibilities . 
  what ? 
  i provided documented evidence that your points are nonsense . 
  i 'm not running away , i 'm stating that you 're spewing propaganda probably fed to you by your corrupt government . 
  and now you 're imagining that you 've won the argument by believing your own lies and refusing to look at the evidence . 
  that is truly pathetic . 
   you have a few dozen ngo boats and some unarmed africans in them , but need other countries to help you with it ? 
  you mean ... navy and coastal guard that obliged by the maritime law to save those poor bastards purposefully drowning themselves in our territorial waters ? 
   you made no point nor refuted any of mine with this statement . 
  i made point by linking the text of the regulation which contains non of the nonsense you said . 
  dublin regulation explicitly sates that in case of the of excessive pressure on the asylum and immigration system of the member state , easo shall assist by working a plan of relieving the pressure to ensure minimum standards of reception . 
  well , guess what , they did , by introducing quotas . 
   the reality is that the eu is not a country , but a set of sovereign states . 
  each state has the responsiblity to guard its borders . 
  you know what the eu common security and defence policy is , right ? 
   you are doing the exact same thing with your inaction against the ngo 's ferrying thousands of migrants to your shores more unfounded bulgarian propaganda . 
   which all illigal migrants are returned to the country of first entry . 
  is that the kind of propaganda you 're being fed in bulgaria ? 
  because i do n't think you understand the point of the [ dublin * regulation * ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:32013r0604 ) . 
  except you 're part of the union already . 
  comparison is n't valid . 
  we 're not forcing migrants on ukraine . 
  so you wo n't be able to wiggle your way out of it , unless you want to return all of the money you leached out of eu , remember that italy is actually contributing into the budget , bulgaria do n't . 
  yeah , yeah , and putin is literally hitler . 
  it 's frankly amazing how both sides of this conflict managing to call each other fascists . 
   that 's how wwll began . 
  not really . 
  historical analogies are non-existent . 
  it 's not an opinion . 
  you have a contested territory . 
  please solve your conflicts yourself and do n't drag the rest of us into it . 
  exactly my point . 
  huh ? 
  it means nothing in terms of nato membership . 
  i 'm not asking if they want in , i 'm asking if ** we ** want them in . 
  even more so . 
  as long as they have contested territories , they wo n't be accepted . 
  well , this picture explains why baltic states are always so angry and rarely consistent . 
  because they 're doing their jobs ? 
  i wonder who told them they 're wanted in nato anyway ? 
  i doubt that they 're interested in straining their very limited resources to protect a bunch of freeloaders . 
  interesting way to start a war . 
   turkey did n't invoke nato article 5 . 
  france invoked the eu equivalent of nato article 5 . 
  article 5 ? 
  against terrorists ? 
  have you even read the treaty ? 
  it 's an incredibly weak strawman . 
   yes erdogan pushed this for some cheap nationalist us vs them propaganda . 
  well , maybe eu and eu leaders shou 've not been cheering to the coup d'\u00e9tat attempt . 
  some were visibly disappointed it failed . 
  i second that . 
  just some senseless nonsense . 
   he and a bunch of volunteer controbutors ( a lot of whom were/are actual weapon and defense experts , just check the contributors section of the site ) have you , yourself looked into their contributors section ? 
  literally random people . 
  writers , self-employed `` journalists '' , consultants in economics , phd students researching social media , a bunch of ngo employees , it specialists . 
  oh a and one british ex-officer not providing neither his rank or spec . 
  let me get is straight . 
  we 're by far not the richest country , we have quite a significant unemployment rate , we get to bear the blunt of the migrant crisis and yet we have to pay contributions to a country like poland that refuses to take their share and does nothing but pushing their political agenda down the rest of eu throats . 
  how is it fair exactly ? 
   the main problem is that many dutch people do n't realise they live in one of the richest countries in the world . 
  they just do n't realise how good they have it . 
  problem for whom ? 
   investigators who investigate the plane wreckage concluded that it was brought down by a buk anti-air missile , since there were missile fragments in the plane fuselage . 
  like it was ever in question . 
  the question is who pressed the button . 
  and by the way [ current operators of buk missiles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buk_missile_system#current_operators ), 
  i do n't think you get the point of my comment . 
  my beef is exclusively with the attention this particular site gets . 
  i 'm not disputing the buk origin or jit conclusions . 
  also . 
  in case of bellingcat it 's all too easy for them to fabricate whatever they call evidence when the conclusions already were made . 
  why ? 
  because some unemployed brit randomly found himself as the center of attentions and have all means to profit from it . 
  can you point what is ** verifiably ** not false ? 
  the fact that people who are clearly not qualified and with zero knowledge of the subject , getting all of their `` intel '' from social media , `` intel '' that is impossible to check or verify , is n't enough to question the resource credibility ? 
  my problem with this website is that people are taking it at face value . 
  false or not , it besides the point here . 
  it boggles my mind that this is now a credible source of information that anyone can really take seriously , it should be classified on par with alex jones . 
  if anything it pushes a very clear narrative . 
  [ yes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eliot_higgins ) , that 's exactly what i mean . 
   eliot higgins was born in 1979 . 
  [ 1 ] in 2012 , when higgins began blogging the syrian civil war , he was an unemployed finance and admin worker who spent his days taking care of his child at home ; [ 1 ] he is married to a turkish woman . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] higgins took the pseudonym brown moses from the frank zappa song `` brown moses '' on the album thing-fish . 
  [ 1 ]  higgins ' analyses of syrian weapons , which began as a hobby out of his home in his spare time , are frequently cited by the press and human rights groups and have led to questions in parliament . 
  [ 1 ] his brown moses blog began in march 2012 by covering the syrian conflict . 
  higgins operates by monitoring over 450 youtube channels daily looking for images of weapons and tracking when new types appear in the war , where , and with whom .
