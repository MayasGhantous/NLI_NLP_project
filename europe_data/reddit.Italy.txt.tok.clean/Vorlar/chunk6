  [ 1 ] according to guardian reporter matthew weaver , higgins has been `` hailed as something of a pioneer '' for his work . 
  i like how people are using the website as a credible source , website made by an unemployed brit , with zero knowledge of any sort of weaponry , and no military background . 
  are you familiar with the term `` confirmation bias '' ? 
  edit : a word, 
  why would they admit it if no one can prove it you anyway ? 
  social media pictures of * a * buk , articles produced by an unemployed brit , as well as `` everyone knows '' ca n't be used in court . 
  let 's be honest here , if someone had any solid evidence , it would be presented already . 
  with all of the narrative and the need to smear russian government as much as possible yet there is no real legal action , just media narrative . 
  if whoever is responsible for russian pr would n't be dumb as hell , they 'd just keep silent about the entire thing instead of presenting some outlandish theories , in which case they 'd even be able to get on top of this entire debacle . 
  fortunately it 's too late now for them but legally it means nothing . 
  and whoever did press the button , even if alive , wo n't be making any statements , surely russian intelligence made sure of it . 
  erdogan 's turkey is stable enough though . 
  seriously ? 
  they are terrorist !, 
  then again people like you used to call taliban and chechen jihadists `` freedom-fighters '' . 
   when it 's possible to peacefully act to prevent conflict and instability then that 's desirable : like in libya ? 
  or syria maybe ? 
  you people draw some flawed analogies with ww2 . 
  if anything the us has profited immensely from `` helping '' you and the soviets . 
  the us profited from ww2 70 years ago . 
  incomparable situation . 
  plus turkey is n't trying to start a war with eu . 
  they 're free to do whatever within their own borders . 
   human rights abuses are everyone 's problems , mostly because the victims are often the ones who need protection the most . 
  why is it my problem ? 
  i 'm not the one who allowed a state like this to flourish by doing nothing and then just hoping that some 3rd country would accept me instead . 
   which grants europe a say in these matters which i believe is nonsense . 
  how about for change we focus on eu instead of solving everyone 's else problems ? 
  i see they 're already spinning the narrative focusing on favoring even more surveillance and censorship . 
  of course they did . 
  why would anyone expect a eastern and central eu countries to accept something that will ruin them ? 
  they live off the rest of eu . 
  how about you let turks to deal with their own problems themselves ? 
  i suspect that huge parts of russia might actually become habitable instead of being frozen wasteland or swamps . 
  i wonder about the contents of their exchange . 
  what kind of argument could lead anyone to doing this ? 
  another `` leak '' ? 
  i see references to the documents in the article and yet no links to the documents themselves , no names of the sources or signatures on the documents ( if there are any signatures at all ) . 
  is n't it funny how many convenient political `` leaks '' are out there lately . 
  no need to prove anything , no need to state you name under whatever lies and misleading conclusions , so convenient . 
  why would you expect that someone would want you there or anywhere else though ? 
   main regions in europe map that includes turkey but completely misses half of europe by omitting most of the eastern europe . 
  you do know the difference between ethnicity and religion , right ? 
  and the point of this comparison is ... ? 
  this is the point of deterrent . 
  russians have theirs , we have ours . 
  only a fool would argue against reasonable military build up . 
  people like to preach about how terrible nuclear weapons are , without realizing that these weapons on both sides are the thing that keeps many heads cool . 
  right or wrong , all things considered a war with russia would be disastrous for all of us . 
  especially nowadays with all of the propaganda and narrative directed against putin and his government , i dread to even imagine what would happen if anyone tries a lybian \\ syrian scenario with russians , even without nukes . 
   russia has nukes pointed at them and ** does not abide by nuclear disarmament deals that it enters into ** . 
   look up the ** budapest memorandum of 1994 ** as one prime example . 
  [ well i looked ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances ) . 
  it has nothing to do with nuclear disarmament of russia . 
  no , you see . 
  we 're good guys here and russians are bad !, 
  our nukes and weapons are purely defensive !, 
  we never attack anyone , only russians do !, 
  funny how everyone forgot about lybia and iraq . 
  nukes are deterrent and not offensive weapons . 
  plus i do n't think that china or sk would appreciate a nuclear wasteland at their borders . 
  agent orange is n't ok either !, 
  the list is surprisingly short actually . 
  especially if we take 2010 and later . 
  i expected more considering that even though [ violet crime rate in russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_russia ) is dropping when compared to what it was 20 years ago , it 's still insanely high . 
  [ russia has the highest homicide rate in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate ) . 
  it 's not like they 're targeting specifically journalists , it 's a messed up country in this regard . 
  still though . 
  there are many countries where conscription is a thing . 
  however , throwing such an enormous masses of people into service does n't make much sense . 
  what are they even doing all day long ? 
  it 's not like nk is in any real war with anyone . 
  not really . 
  unless you want to bomb every square meter of the country . 
  47.8 per 1000 capita in north korea . 
  31.6 per 1000 capita in eritrea . 
  what the hell ? 
  how is it even possible or economically \\ socially viable ? 
  1190000 of north koreans can still wreck havoc all around . 
  they wo n't be able to go far or win a war against china but they 're more than capable to turn large parts of south korea into smoldering ruin and they wo n't go down without fighting . 
  it 's ministry of foreign affairs rep , not russian ama stand . 
  by definition they do n't have a position on something concerning internal matters of the country . 
  you people realize that erdogan will then start questioning if turkey should stay in nato and use it as a bargaining chip , right ? 
  political posturing now will result in consequences reaching far beyond this summit . 
  she actually raised a fair question , what does it have to do with ministry of ** foreign affairs ** ? 
  [ he approves this message !, 
  what was proposed by you is n't `` sending back their people '' but building detention centers on foreign soil . 
  the solution is simple , just enforce our own borders . 
  that 's it . 
  a few sunk boats ought to dissuade the rest from attempting the same . 
   if there 's no functional government then the eu can just build a refugees center in lybia . 
  it 's called a military invasion . 
  first trash the country , then occupy parts of it . 
  it 's expensive as hell for starters . 
  plus no company would allow a bunch of migrants to trash their ships . 
  not to mention , cruise ships are n't prison ships . 
  how are you going to keep these people at bay ? 
   italy is , so there are countries who do . 
  it 's not like we have any choice really . 
  merkel does n't look kindly on those who do n't like to pay for her hospitality and italy is in no position to stand against german economic grip .
