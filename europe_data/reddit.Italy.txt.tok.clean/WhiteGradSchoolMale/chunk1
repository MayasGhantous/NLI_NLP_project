we do n't have a problem with the concept of a trans-atlantic trade agreement , we have a problem with the actual implementation . 
  it seems to us that we are giving away some our precious consumer rights and standards for no clear benefit and no comparable concessions from our counterpart . 
  our lega nord is only nominally separatist . 
  it used to be a bit more active on that front , but has since effectively abandoned any effort towards secession . 
  they are an autonomist movement on a heavy decline , due to competition from other populist movements and a string of scandals that have plagued it for the last few years . 
  in any case , about your question : the ultra-local separatist movements have even less of a chance at success than the ln . 
  if a secession of the northern regions ever takes place , they will secede together to form a new state , not several smaller ones . 
  of those who have already moved , one was at cambridge ( moved to king 's college for her phd ) , three are at ens paris , one at lmu in munich , one at university of amsterdam , two at imperial college in london , one at another london university whose name escapes me right now , three are in zurich either at ethz or uzh . 
  that 's for those that stayed in academia . 
  a good many went to work in finance and are now mostly in london , as you would expect . 
  as for those that are still finishing school , the destinations are basically the same as above . 
  i have a couple of friends who have applied to programs overseas , one of them guys is almost certainly going to madison for his phd . 
  of course they do . 
  it 's happening here as well . 
  especially for university graduates who want to stay in academia or r&d , foreign institutions and companies are as attractive as ever . 
  think about it . 
  you are young , educated , top of your class or close . 
  you have passion for what you do and the skill to do it . 
  what does your country have to offer ? 
  - 3,4 $ / h internships ? 
  ( i am not kidding ) - 1.100 $ / month starting salary as a mechanical engineer , with little prospect of advancement ? 
  - a 1 in 4 chance of admission to a medical residency , regardless of skill , because of budget cuts ( and we do need the newly-trained physicians , according to our own forecasts ) ? 
  - 1000 $ / month salary for a full-time phd candidate ? 
  - horribly slashed research funding , so even if you do n't care about your own income you do n't have the funds to do your job ? 
  right now , the incentive to go abroad is enormous . 
  i 'm in my last year of school and all the best students are looking for opportunities abroad ; very few are willing to stay , and most that do end up in one of the few exceptional institutions or companies that still make competitive offers . 
  and i can only imagine how much worse the situation must be in greece . 
   that will raise awareness . 
  it 's the one website , apart from facebook , whose loss could piss off enough ordinary people for something to happen . 
  but of course they could roll it back from youtube and claim that it 's fixed , go back to your censorship now , nothing to see . 
   in the meantime the new privacy regulation places a lot of emphasis on individual control over information . 
  how many people have even heard of privacy-violating laws ? 
  i can tell you that , in italy , the mainstream media has barely even talked about * our own * obscene extra-judicial censorship law , nevermind cameron 's internet filter . 
   why are so many countries worried about inflation , when it 's below 1 % ? 
  ( it 's actually a bit higher than 1 % in certain countries , but your point still stands ) i think the trouble is with the wording of the question . 
  `` inflation '' is a technical term whose connection with everyday life not too many people understand . 
  however , everybody understands what `` raising prices '' means and nobody likes it . 
  if you ask what two items are the most worrisome , you can bet a lot of people will choose `` raising prices '' as one of the two . 
   i was talking about the population , not the politics . 
  both of those laws were subject to their own popular referendum and both passed with overwhelming support . 
   and even in politics , gay rights or euthanasia still seem a very long way off in italy as well imo . 
  euthanasia is only legal in a [ handful of countries ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/euthanasia_and_the_law.png ) ; we are probably going to see at least civil partnerships in the next few years . 
   italy : why does n't everybody die the first day they come near a road ? 
  we have developed a complex communication system to deal with this . 
  it 's based on the liberal honking of your car horn to warn anybody that might potentially be getting in your way that it is , in fact , * your * way . 
  it also produces a beautiful cacophony of sounds that turns your brain into pudding in about 5 seconds when you hit a major road . 
  just kidding though that happens only in the south . 
  up here drivers are as civilized as ever and in the last decade they 've even learned to always stop at pedestrian crossings . 
   and i 'd have guessed that italy being catholic would also be prosecuting the map shows the exact opposite . 
  prostitution is legal but not regulated and brothels are illegal ; neither the client nor the prostitute is prosecuted . 
  actually , there have been several attempts by conservative local administrations to prosecute prostitutes and clients on civil grounds by using fines and similar instruments , but they have been repeatedly shut down in court . 
   italy , ireland and poland are still very religious and conservative you are mixing apples and potatoes there . 
  italy is pretty religious and conservative , but unlike in ireland and poland voluntary abortion has been legal since 1978 , divorce since 1970 ( in ireland it is since * 1996 * ) etc. 
  spaniards : is it really so certain that it will pass at the parliamentary stage ? 
  cause i want to believe there 's a chance for sanity to prevail . 
  strange , as an italian i had n't heard of napolitano expressing fear of a `` violent insurrection '' . 
  and it 's because he did n't . 
  he talked of `` social unrest '' , but at this point it would be ridiculous to talk about insurrection . 
  the latest protests were the largest grassroots protests we 've had so far and they were rather peaceful . 
  in terms of turmoil , the most pressing threat is the possibility that workers in the transportation industry will launch a prolonged strike . 
  that 's a far , far cry from the idea of people violently raising against the institutions . 
  sure , but it still beats freezing in winter and going broke in spring . 
  considering they also bought 15 billion in ukranian bonds and thus gave them a credit lifeline , i 'd call that `` mace and pastry '' : you either refuse us and freeze to death then go bankrupt next year , or you stick with us and you pay less for gas and we save you from bankruptcy . 
  exactly . 
  pernicious lies must always be fought against lest they turn into `` everybody-knows '' . 
  well , at least we 'll save 1.50 $ a year each . 
  i 'd say it 's worth it in return for instituting a financing system that strongly favors the influence of the rich and the connected in politics . 
  berlusconi 's party being by far the best financed , now that 's a result we were all hoping for . 
  ------ seriously though , this is yet another spectacular failure of a government so devoid of any original idea it has taken up time and again the rallying calls of the worse populists just to show they were doing something . 
  earlier this year they abolished the property tax on private houses because berlusconi had promised it during his electoral campaign , then they ended up re-introducing it under a different name because - big surprise - we could n't afford that tax cut . 
  just brilliant . 
  maybe they 've tried ? 
  problematic parents might not respond to traditional incentives or punishments ( e.g. . parents with no money will hardly be bothered by yet another unpaid fine \\ bill \\ tax ), 
  same here . 
  never heard of social workers having to go wake up the kids but if it works , why not ? 
  the right of the parents to not have their door knocked on does n't trump the right of the kids to get a basic education . 
  thread title : `` prostitution now illegal in france . '', 
  body of the article : `` under the new bill , ** prostitution will remain legal ** and the act of soliciting will now not be punished . '', 
  please let 's not just turn / r/europe into / r/worldnews ( aka r/sensationalizedheadlines ), 
   do n't be a dick and misinterpret other people 's arguments . 
  it 's the exact same situation . 
  there are perfectly legal and reasonable reasons to maintain personal information ( like political affiliation ) private . 
   offensive slogans against spain ? 
  why would you even offend your country ? 
  would n't your goal be to offend the government and not the country ? 
  `` the government sucks '' could very easily be argued to be offensive against spain , since the executive is a constitutional entity and part of the spanish state . 
  also , the fine does n't have to stand up against appeal to be oppressive , since its very existence will discourage people from taking the risk . 
   only people planning on rioting and neckbears wear masks during protests . 
  `` only people planning on doing something illegal want privacy in their emails . '', 
  maybe i do n't want my family or friends to know that i went to some political demonstration . 
  maybe i do n't want my employer seeing me demonstrating against something he supports . 
   `` so yea , that thing that happened back then ... maybe in hindsight it was n't such a good idea . '', 
  fuck him . 
  it was more like `` yeah it sucked but hey , it was retaliation for a previous attack on us and i was acting under orders so i do n't really feel like i 'm guilty of anything '' . 
  keep in mind that this guy did not just pass the order along , he took charge of the thing and physically made reluctant officers shoot when they were refusing to . 
  ** italy ** : - one of berlusconi 's former , uh , party girls gave a long interview on tv . 
  among the choicest bits the shocking revelation that berlusconi 's current girlfriend might be a gold digger and a lesbian ( the latter generated way more scandal ) . 
  - as we finally decided we were * not * going to dump nazi war criminal priebke 's body in the ocean ( he is being buried in a secret location ) , his lawyer released a statement saying he was happy about `` finally winning out against the abuse from the jews '' . 
  you just ca n't win with these people . 
  - the government needs to come up with 5 billion for a budget adjustment .
