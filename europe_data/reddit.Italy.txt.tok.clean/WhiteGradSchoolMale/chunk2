  they thought to take that from the healthcare budget but it was calmly explained to them that at this point we 'd have to start shutting down hospitals to do that . 
  now they are thinking of selling off non-controlling stock in government-controlled companies , which apparently did n't occur to them before . 
  - no worries though , the budget adjustment will also include tax cuts amounting to an extra 15 $ a month for each worker . 
  wild celebrations have been held in the streets of rome but fortunately the police managed to disperse them before they set fire [ 1 ] to the treasury building . 
  - berlusconi got his ban from public office recalculated to 2 years , down from the previous 3 . 
  his lawyer called this a `` perversion of justice '' and is appealing the decision . 
  - apparently one of the new taxes that are going to be introduced is going to be called taser . 
  yes , like the stun gun . 
  [ 1 ] ok that 's hyperbole , they just threw a few firecrackers and three homemade pipe bombs ( weirdly filled with bullets ) were found abandoned in an alley . 
   everyone is talking about how we do n't have to worry like japan and europe because we have so many immigrants coming from latin america and east asia . 
  i get japan which has really strict immigration policies but europe ? 
  in the eu the contribute of immigration to population increase has been higher than that of births [ since 1992 ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/population_and_population_change_statistics#eu-27_population_continues_to_grow ) and the overall population growth trend is the same since the [ 1960s ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/images/thumb/e/ef/population%2c_eu-27%2c_1960-2012_%281%29_%28at_1_january%2c_million_persons%29.png/350px-population%2c_eu-27%2c_1960-2012_%281%29_%28at_1_january%2c_million_persons%29.png ) . 
   and you 're forgetting spain . 
  no , i 'm not forgetting it , i 'm purposefully excluding it because it 's much smaller in terms of population and gdp . 
  germany , the uk , france and italy are the four eu countries with a gdp over 2 trillion and they are the core of the eu . 
   i do n't know about italy , they have two aircraft carriers we have two mini-carriers , as i have already explained to you another post , which are * not capable * of launching long-range aircraft , which makes them unsuitable for power projection . 
   yes , i 'm sure being allied with the world 's largest military and only remaining super power only played a small part in their decision . 
  it was only a small part of the `` attraction '' . 
  the us does not have the world 's largest military and a large military is not the only important thing . 
  if russia had been wealthier than western europe do you think the eastern european countries would have still gravitated towards the eu because of nato ? 
  you sound like you are straight out of r/murica . 
  edit : nevermind , i looked through your post history and you basically in every thread that 's slightly critical of america going on about how your country is basically doing everything right or at least better than anyone else . 
  why i did n't catch up to that earlier is beyond me . 
  [ a boatload ] ( http://it.wikisource.org/wiki/trattato_di_pace_fra_l%27italia_e_le_potenze_alleate_ed_associate_-_parigi,_10_febbraio_1947 ) . 
  some of those are circumvented in the context of nato by having equipment formally be the property of some other country , or by tricks like re-designing equipment class to some non-prohibited type . 
  a lot actually apply and severely curb the capability of our military , especially when it comes to actual force projection . 
   tl ; dr my point is that there 's enough blame to go around . 
  it should n't distract from this conversation nor europe 's need for a more capable and integrated military . 
  now is not the time for the blame game . 
  that 'd be a nice sentiment if you did n't spend the rest of your post `` playing the blame game '' . 
  by the way , if the worst thing that could be said of italian foreign interventions is that some our * corporations * ( not even our state itself ) did * environmental damage * in somalia , i think we have a pretty decent track record compared to most others . 
  especially to the us . 
   i 'm not sure about germany , but there 's no us ban on italy 's military . 
  treaty of paris 1947 :  art . 
  that means `` no aircraft carrier ship '' . 
  the other articles impose limitations on various other types of weapons systems . 
  it 's the reason why we re-classify the cavour and the garibaldi as * portaeromobili * ( sub-carriers ) and why they are built * without * the ability to launch long-range bombers ( at least with current technology ) . 
   libya has shown that europe , as a whole , is incapable of regional power projection and when it needs to be brought to task , it has to rely on america for several critical elements of support . 
  you know , considering the media narrative i had taken you at your word , but i do n't find much evidence that us help was needed or called in . 
  looking at the [ timeline ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_libya#proposal_for_the_no-fly_zone ) , it seems the us was going to intervene whether we did or not for its own reasons . 
  looking at the [ expenses ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_libya#costs ) , just the top three eu contributors easily outspent the us , even if we take the highest estimate for us expenditures and the lowest for uk expenditures . 
  so no , i 'm not convinced that libya proves much of anything . 
   mali also shows this , but too a hugely lesser extent , but regardless , american logistical and intelligence support was still needed , even if not to the degree in libya . 
  again , i find no evidence that it was needed . 
  it helped , it was a good thing , but did france lack the capability to act on its own ? 
  i do n't know that . 
   and the arrangement you have now is inefficient and incapable . 
  judging by results , it 's actually working out quite nicely . 
  the places we have most invested in seem really willing to align with us . 
   what european union foreign policy has shown is that whenever they need to do something that requires hard power instead of soft power , they have to constantly rely on , as i 've mentioned many of times before , the united kingdom , france & america . 
   [ ... ]  you 're doing things with one hand behind your back and you 're being constantly reliant on the u.k. , u.s. & france . 
  i do n't get why you constantly separate europe on one side and the uk and france on the other . 
  the uk and france are part of europe , actually two rather important parts . 
  the other major countries by gdp and population , germany and italy , have wwii-era limitations on the size and capabilities of their militaries . 
   also , as for eastern europe , many flocked to the e.u. , but do you think they would 've been so keen to do that , especially with russia hot their tail trying to drag them back into their sphere of influence , if it was n't for a u.s.-backed nato and security guarantee ? 
  russia did try its hardest to not let them go west and of course nato ( which , by the way , is a * joint * us-western europe endeavor ) protection was part of the attraction , but let 's not pretend like it was the us ' work that lead them towards the eu . 
   if we want to go back , how about we just settle on the fact that most of the middle east 's problems today can be directly traced back to the way europe drew up the map after de-colonization . 
  so `` it 's no longer the cold war '' is a good time scale to call out europe on its supposed deficiencies in regional interventions , but for judging who 's responsible for the situation in the middle east suddenly the correct time scale is 60 years ago ? 
  how convenient  the fact of the matter remains that most of the current problematic situations in the middle east were direct results of us involvement . 
  the us armed the talibans in afghanistan when it suited their aim to stop soviet expansion . 
  the us armed saddam when he was fighting iran . 
  the us toppled a popular iranian government directly resulting in the islamist revoution and present theocracy . 
  the us , by the way , is the * one * country staunchly supporting israel and blocking all attempts , even at a un level , to force its compliance with basic international law ( such as stopping the settlements in occupied territory ) . 
  no silly , those are * portaeromobili *  it 's a thin-veiled re-designation to allow those ships despite the ban imposed with the paris treaty . 
  they are miniature aircraft carriers with built-in design limitations that * prevent * them from being used for force projection : the type of aircraft that can take off from them are suitable for local defense but not for deep operations . 
  their role is to provide a maritime air component to italy 's enduring role within nato , namely to protect the tirrenian shipping lanes and otranto straits . 
   she can have a path to citizenship which is independent from the political asylum request of her parents . 
  zero-tolerance is a stupid course of action , considering that the majority of this girl 's life was in france and she 's still a minor . 
  ( ok , hollande says she can return alone , but only after the ridiculous show his government put on ) i agree she should n't have been taken from her school bus in such an inconsiderate manner ( and , by the way , so does practically everybody ) . 
  but i think it was a more than reasonable compromise to offer her to return , this time legally , in light of her upbringing in the french system . 
  is n't this what you said when you wrote :  she can have a path to citizenship which is independent from the political asylum request of her parents . 
   interventions like mali were highly important for european interests for example , france ( and the uk ) should n't be expected to do everything when it 's our common interest . 
  was france ready to have german or italian aircraft in n'djamena ? 
  did it ask its european partners to participate ? 
  beside the specific mali situation and talking more generally of force projection : are france and the uk ready to lift the ban on germany and italy possessing aircraft carriers ( and various other weapon systems ) ? 
  or the ban on italy having military bases on the smaller mediterranean islands ? 
   here you have one girl who stayed in school and it is integrated etc. . . and you deport her . 
  because she is not legally in the country . 
  her ethnicity has no bearing over her right to be in france . 
  she is a citizen of kosovo and thus needs a permit to be in france . 
  her family lost a legal case to obtain asylum and was consequently deported . 
  the big scandal was about how the police took her from a school bus , which was quite inconsiderate . 
  the fact that she was lawfully expelled from the country was not a point of contention . 
  also , i find that judging whether illegal immigrants should stay or not by their degree of `` integration '' to be a bad idea and rife with problems . 
  who judges it , and along what lines ? 
  how is this not supposed to promote illegal immigration in the hope that one will later be found `` worthy '' and be allowed to stay ? 
   i never once hinted that the `` glorious us of a protected europe alone '' . 
  i never wrote that the usa protected europe `` alone '' , you added that in the quotes . 
  i actually pointed out that it was mostly european resources that protected europe . 
   and that 's just as bad . 
  you have all of europe piggybacking off two countries and a foreign country . 
  you see nothing wrong with that ? 
  nothing irresponsible ? 
  what i see is a continent that has very recently acquired full sovereignty and is still trying to decide how to organize its common institutions . 
  we 'll create whatever arrangement we believe is right for us , with many thanks to america for its suggestions . 
   if the european union wants to integrate further militarily , if it actually wants to have some kind of effect and cohesive military if , you mean , we are to step into america 's boots and manage things exactly as america used to ... except , you know , we might want to do things differently . 
   and it is no longer the cold war . 
  exactly . 
  the scary soviet monster has crumbled and it was not because of military pressure . 
  in less than twenty years its western provinces have joined us and many more are clamoring to do the same , all of that without firing a single shot .
