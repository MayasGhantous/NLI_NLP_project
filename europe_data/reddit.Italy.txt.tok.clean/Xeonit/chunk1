you got it right . 
  the existing mentality is the only fuel that keeps mafia alive . 
  we are in 2014 dude , not 1920, 
  but we speak english here , exactly to eliminate language barriers , so stop behaving like you 're the special kid . 
  saluti, 
  pasta is ready guys, 
   to expand a little bit more - being a ` turk ' in america does n't make you less american . 
  being called a turk in germany does imply that you are less german . 
  no , being turk in germany means that you 're turkish and not german . 
  its not all about your fake multiculturalism where you `` can just show up '' . 
  this so called issues come from the fact that we are multicultural , because europe has been the seat of various empires/reigns/civilizations during the last 3000 years , so we developed many national identities . 
  this is something americans cant say , so everytime people bring up the `` hey just show up and you can be american '' it feels like youre trying to deny the value of millennia of history and say `` who cares , i can do whatever i want '' . 
  truth is , your multiculturalism is just an empty concept . 
  after all , what is the place where black people and other minorities are sistematically treated with less respect than white people ? 
  hint : not europe if i were to move to the us , say for working , i would still be italian . 
  not american . 
  if they 're from turkey theyre turks , if they 're from italy they 're italians , if they 're from mars , theyre martians . 
  i dont understand the nonsense of the x-american thing . 
  a few days ago i asked a guy with an italian username if he was italian . 
  he said yes . 
  i then proceded to tell him hi in italian , but he suddenly said `` no im italian-american , i only speak english and spanish '' . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  in italy we call people from turkey ( turchia ) `` turchi '' . 
  so basically that would be racist ? 
  so since there have been cases of contamination now you can go around saying that hundreds of people die ... as a joke . . my humor must be outdated, 
  from wikipedia : `` pizza berlusconi is kotipizza 's name for its smoked reindeer pizza . 
  with pizza berlusconi , kotipizza won the america 's plate international pizza ** contest in new york ** in march 2008 , beating the ** italian-americans ** , who got second place , and the australians at third . 
  [ 5 '' so , the contest was held in new york . 
  theres no chance that pizza could have beaten an italian one if the contest was held in the country that invented the pizza . 
  [ i would still eat it though ], 
   it 's not like hundreds dying because of poisonous oil or high amounts of enviromental toxins bear any relevance here umm . . what ? 
  anyway , i said apart fromt he berlusconi thing because i already knew how ridiculous he looked/sounded . 
  do you live in nosarcasmland or something ? 
  apart from the berlusconi thing , did some italian participate in the contest ? 
  by italian i dont mean italian-american . 
  also , where was the contest held ? 
  i swear journalists always find a way to fucking exaggerate . 
  apartheid ? 
  are you even serious ? 
   africa  more fertile, 
  you 're reading that from your bunker ? 
  yeah let 's all go at 40km/h . 
  how about thougher driving schools ? 
  milan is the team with the most titles in the world . 
  i think only real madrid could have more titles than milan . 
  not sure . 
  what should they read ? 
  you dont have to . 
  while i agree that dubbing makes a movie lose a bit of value in terms of jokes and cultural related stuff , i do still enjoy movies dubbed in my language . 
  luckily , in italy we have one of the best dubbing schools of the world , so we get a professional product . 
  also , i enjoy more watching movies in my language , since even being very proficient with another one does n't allow you to fully appreciate the content . 
  those buildings werent made by `` americans '' , they were made by natives . 
  you are not descendant of those natives , so by extension you cant count those . 
  and your oldest building is . . what , 200 years old ? 
  pretty paranoid about being insulted ? 
   i ca n't even imagine the lives of my ancestors then you really ca n't comprehend this subject . 
  every single person of european origins is too proud of their heritage to just forget about it . 
  my ancestors go back to latins greek and byzantines , and before that even older and smaller civilizations . 
  * im not writing this to say that your cultural heritage have no value . 
  * what i 'm saying is that i cant and wont ever forget about mine , just like everyone in europe . 
  it 's not a case that europe 's motto is ** `` united in diversity '' ** . 
  americans truly have difficulties understanding that each country in europe has millennia of history , not just 2 centuries, 
  my friend , i know this story better than you , thats sure . 
  its the 4th fourth time i see it posted here and people still insist on saying that the reason those scientists were convicted wasnt for `` not foreseeing an earthquake '' , but rather for not letting people know in advance of a potential danger . 
  also potential = high probabilities that it can happen , but it could also not happen, 
  wait ... maybe they condemned them because ... they didnt warn about a potential earthquake in time , and not for not foreseeing when it was going to happen with a millisecond precision ? 
  oh , what am i saying, 
  sarcasm is strong within this one, 
  i know people from all over europe , and even though their economy may be better then ours , i never heard that they had such high quantities of money . 
  maybe its the east that is very poor , so what is normal for us seems exaggerated for you . 
   abroad in the developed west - where money falls off the sky do i live in a different west or something ? 
  such is life, 
  if this is sarcasm , i dont understand it, 
  kid ? 
  man i hate this attitude, 
   might have been yeah they were totally going for a fishing session, 
  italy not even that bad : [ gabry ponte - geordie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwzuki6yzkc ) its a remake of an older song from fabrizio de andr\u00e8 , which was not even closely related to dance, 
  thanks for reminding me of this one , i love it !, 
  i hate that song to much, 
  la dance spacca . 
  period . 
  ahh good old 90s eurodance feels, 
  i used to sing it when i was little . 
  i 'm a male . 
  no regrets . 
  ^ ^ ^ ( didnt ^ ^ know ^ ^ the ^ ^ meaning ), 
  im from the south . 
  in order to get to my city you can have the pleasure of taking a fairly new train ( 5-6 years ) which rides in parallel with a few trains from 1973 . 
  . . thats why i mentioned northern and southern dialects and accent , or local slang , if you want . 
  also , anvedi its indeed incorrect , but its a local variation , so a different form of speaking . 
  your accent is not proper italian accent . 
  the closest one is tuscan . 
  so you 're telling me that saying `` ao anvedi sto fiodena '' its italian ? 
  spoken tuscan and roman is different from italian . 
  not much , but it is . 
  this difference , together with dialects , wo n't disappear anytime soon, 
  do you live in italy ? 
  in the south , dialects are still used , a lot . 
  the accent of rome or the tuscan one will not disappear anytime soon . 
  i dont know about thw north .
