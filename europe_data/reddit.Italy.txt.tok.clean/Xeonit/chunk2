  the blasphemy thing is indeed true . 
  maybe its the result of the church being in italy for too long . 
  anyway , mannaggia a cristo scalzo in una valle di chiodi . 
  ( christ walking barefoot in a valley full of needles ), 
  americans drink it at lunch . 
  i 'd say modern italians ~ romans, 
  im italian and i put them in random order , btw . 
  im definitely biased , but i think that italian is the best of the three because its so close to latin . 
  french is very elegant , and spanish resembles the two . 
  i just love the fact that when we speak italian we still casually use latin words/phrases . 
  your ancestors were really good at speaking latin, 
  not to sound picky , but english is not comparable in terms of beauty with spanish , italian and french . 
  in italy , during those years , nobody really cared much about the war . 
  there where the `` politicians '' , general etc. . but the average italian would have avoided nazi germany and being allied with it like the plague if it wasnt too late . 
  seems weird . 
  maybe they add a wrist rotation to give it more emphasis . 
  the center of rotation is not the wrist but the elbow , always remember this . 
  wow such inspiring yet clich\u00e9 words !, 
  nobody will go at war with anyone . 
  how can you even believe that, 
  separarists only look at the economical side of the coin . 
  have you ever heard of military integrity ? 
  the more you split , the weaker you 'll be . 
  dumb title is dumb . 
  you nailed it with your first sentence . 
  in italy there 's the trend of calling everyone whos not on the left side a fascist . 
  also , lega nord and people who support it are dumbasses, 
  where , for example , the first one was induced by butthurt colonialist countries who didnt want any competition ? 
   in 1938 the italians invaded greece * wrong . 
  * the greco-italian war , also known as the italo-greek war , was a conflict between italy and greece , which lasted from 28 october ** 1940 ** to 23 april 1941 also : world war ii ( wwii or ww2 ) , also known as the second world war , was a global war . 
  it is generally considered to have lasted from ** 1939 ** to 1945 . 
   ran into a bit of trouble * true . 
  when did we start a war , exactly ? 
  we do my friend , we do . 
   they have started both world wars wat, 
  dont use this as a fucking excuse to come here and post nonsense . 
  i hope tomorrow will be a better day for you . 
  spaco botilia amazo familia, 
  a spanish friend of mine called portugal el hermano retrasado de espa\u00f1a . . hehe , dont know why, 
  thats a huge generalization dude . 
  huge . 
  3rd world country . 
  you 're even offending . 
  lets not even start to talk about its like , that . 
  does unification tell you something ? 
   you are implying that spain will attack diplomatically nooooooooooooooo !, 
  no attacks . 
  just worsened relations . 
  jfc . 
  you did n't even understand my post and you call me childish ? 
  childish ? 
  the hell was that ? 
  i said what i wrote , nothing else, 
  i just followed logic though . 
  who would risk their relation with spain by recognizing catalonia ? 
  yeah let 's split the eu in many more states , so that organization become harder !, 
  you 're ~ ~ fucking ~ ~ delusional . 
  a strong union is n't made of thousands of tiny counties , but of a few big ones, 
  i 'll laugh when not a single country in eu recognizes catalonia , and you 'll be sitting there without much to do . 
  while i understand your sentimentalism , independence is not an option . 
  you wo n't become a second switzerland , you 'll just become a small state that will probably be used for political moves by the highest payer . 
  plot twist 9 : there 's no twist, 
  do you work in the redundancy office of redundancy ? 
  what the hell does that mean ? 
  you ancestors did n't fight for nothing . 
  the culture we have now is the result of millennia of fighting , and finally we 're stable, 
  oh lol , alessandra mussolini . . she just has his grand father face and surname , that time is long gone . . do n't give her much importance, 
  in italy there are people living in `` momentary tents '' due to their city being destroyed by an earthquake , like the irpinia one . 
  the catch ? 
  the irpinia earthquake happened 20 + years ago . 
  they 're still living in momentary housing , which is a tiny bit better than a tent a whole lot worse than a house . 
  20 + years . 
  but of course the clandestines have priority . 
  what ? 
  you do n't know what hate is, 
  merkel, 
  found don quixote, 
  i 'm sure italy will happily give you an island / s, 
  so what ? 
  the fact that he was a kid does n't affect me more than if he was an adult . 
  his parents knew the risks . 
  and why should this interest us ? 
  let 's play the `` that 's how things work , the strong win and the weak loses '' game instead . 
  that 's how the world works , and now the same thing is just covered by politics . 
  idiotic comment . 
  let 's ask italy to repay for the conquest of thr mediterranean , or the french for the conquest of southern italy too . 
  my little brain ? 
  you 're funny, 
  `` hey look they do n't write like me . 
  if stormfront does n't write like me , and neither do they , they must be from stormfront ! '', 
  yeah it literally is the only one being reported, 
  i dont feel any guilt , honestly, 
  here is some more advice : skin colour has nothing to do with it, 
  apparently its too hard for him to form an opinion based on past and repated events . 
  you know how they say , history repeat itself !, 
  but he probably doesnt know it, 
  and your point is ? 
  the subject was the validity of marriage, 
  after a christian marriage you have to register the act at the municipality , which is n't the case of these arranged sharia marriages edit : i 'm not sure if you 're going for the `` 2edgy4me '' effect or not, 
  that 's why they need some automation . . you 've been caught crossing illegally or whatever ?
