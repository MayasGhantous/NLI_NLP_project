  you get a sentence proportional to the offence . 
  i do n't think they need a defense since they would be caught in the act, 
  what about setting up a separated and specialized tribunal for such cases ? 
  you could even automate some stuff . 
  maybe it was too hard for them, 
  you should answer it yourself , since this question shows an absurd lack of historical knowledge, 
  we do n't have `` millions '' of muslims , read some statistics, 
  yeah you 're ** definitely ** exaggerating . 
  what do you do if you see the short video of hitler with glowing sticks and techno music ? 
  call the police ? 
  lol, 
  i chose it for his facial expressions , if you cant see the funny part of it you may be taking it too seriously, 
  i just see it as a simple `` deal with it '' / `` 0 fucks given '' gif . 
  haha thank you for finding it , i had lost it !, 
  well , i agree ... to a certain degree . 
  i noticed that a huge chunk of the population isnt very bright , take for example the 43 % of functional illiterates . . but saying that almost everyone is like that . . i dont know , maybe i dont like the idea or maybe being for years in an academic setting has `` sheltered '' me, 
  - i speak 3 languages - i do move my hands , just like a normal person - not catholic - the ruling class is corrupt , dont offend all the population - im not sexist - yes i love food edit : ok im obsessed with food and a bonus : - i dont generalize wildly, 
  lol what ? 
  we 're 60 + millions, 
  roses are red violets are blue i have a knife get in the van, 
  could be because they were almost . 
  killed off ? 
  edit : holy shit i just realized !, 
  the natives do n't want to integrate !!, 
  are you fucking kidding me dude ? 
  hahah what the hell, 
   as for the fear you feel when you go out of your house , ever consider that maybe it 's a highly irrational fear ? 
  i feel scared when im outside , who the hell wrote that ? 
  its about insecurity . 
  when i go out i expect to be perfectly safe , and thats always the case . 
  what about the people on that train ? 
  how the fuck do you think thay feel ? 
   all i see from you is ignoring historical realities the great migration periods , and it sure was n't between europeans themselves you numb-nuts . 
  i didnt ignore them , since . . you know . . im italian , so i know about the barbarian invasions . 
  my mistake not to include them though . 
  anyway , those represent a perfect example of why unregulated and excessive immigration is a problem . 
  unfortunately for the romans , even if they wanted stop them , they were technologically limited and basically disgregated , so they couldnt have done much to avoid them . 
   ** some ** of them are well educated , others are not a very little part , probably . 
  and they are welcome . 
  not their savage counterpart . 
   furthermore , just because someone is uneducated does n't mean they want to steal or murder , uneducated people are n't evil by default and neither are poor people . 
  no , but statistically low education and poverty breeds crime , as you probably already know . 
   justify european ` purism ' there 's no european purism . 
  the people from my region themselves are a mix of latin-greek-byzantine-spanish and a little bit of french . 
  with time , however , the difference between these mixes normalize , and you get a good homogeneity . 
  it also helps that these culture were quite similar . 
   you generalize that all the immigrants are uneducated criminals i really dont , and there you have the proof that you didnt understand what i wrote . 
  i said that there are regular immigrants and clandestines . 
  its not hard to guess which ones are probably better educated . 
   the chances of getting hurt are very small , but when something happens it makes the news and it makes people freak out yeah when you hear every week that somebody went crazy and killed someone people may freak out . 
  also , you know . . they dont come from peaceful countries , so people dont know what to expect, 
  yeah your contribution really brought the level down . 
  the papers ?? 
  what is it with reddit and the papers ? 
  thats basic physics , and believe it or not it works the same way in sociology . 
  those would be tremendous changes ? 
  wow . . a genocide , and epidemy , a long war . . these are tremendous changes , not the invention of a smartphone, 
   tradition does not equal culture oh really ? 
  my city is very religious , and they organize a lot of processions during the year . 
  that come from the very religious culture that created this tradition . 
  i doubt that in helsinki they have a lot of religious processions . 
  culture is indeed a mix of traditions , and it takes centuries for it to stabilize , or to put it in a physics term , to reach an equilibrium . 
  you cant expect a well estabilished culture to suddenly change some core aspects . 
   values change . 
  culture changes . 
  yes , exactly , it adapts to new eras . 
  but you are aware that a slow adaptation gives better results than a fast adaptation ? 
  see again the part about equilibrium, 
   it was n't just territorial wars between nations , there was a lot of migration yes , between european themselves . 
  there were a lot of indians , chinese and arabs in europe from the year 0 to 1900 , right ? 
   are you voluntarily ignoring the fact that a few hundred thousand people is never going to destabilize a country like germany or italy for that matter ? 
  most of these immigrants wo n't even be granted a refugee status you know what destabilizing means ? 
  it means not feeling safe when you get out of your home . 
  or when you get on the train !, 
  im sure you read about the avoided accident in belgium . 
  thats not destabilizing for you ? 
  the fact that you have to fear this shit even if you want to fucking travel ? 
   it 's retarded that you think western civilization is so fragile as to break under the weight of a few hundred thousand immigrants . 
  right , and i never said that . 
  besides , a few hundred thousands is nothing for you ? 
   although i guess it 's easy to fear this so much when you presume that every immigrant is a terrorist , a criminal , or a lazy bum oh of course , theyre all well educated people . 
   maybe if you would accept the fact that the vast majority of them are regular people that want to have a better life , ** not to steal or kill people ** , you 'd realize that this is n't something that will destroy europe . 
  youre goddamn deluded . 
  say that again after seeing them scream allah akbar and throwing stones at the police in macedonia . 
  say that again after seeing them throw the food given to them on the floor because they dont like it , when thousands of more deserving people starve each day . 
  oh really ? 
  so people from bavaria forgot their traditions for the sake of globalization ? 
  i 'll remind you that my country , italy , was unified 154 years ago , and you can be sure that certain things never changed . 
  may i ask where are you from ? 
  i should write a book called `` effects of rapid and unregulated immigration and the voluntary refusal of adapting to your host nation customs '' . 
  the `` surface '' elements of some country 's culture can change , but the core will remain there unchanged . 
  yes , millennia of territorial wars that led to the formation of the modern nations through a gradual rise in homogeneity . 
  are you voluntarily ignoring the fact that an excessive amount of people that refuses to adapt is dangerous and destabilizing for a country ? 
  it 's adjusted on your income and goes from 300 to 1600 euro per year ( books and transportation excluded ), 
  in the 19th century . 
  what else did we lose before ww2 ? 
  he said that he doesnt want to see his people erased by an excessive amount of immigrants . 
  i think the same thing , with the addition of illegal when talking about immigrants . 
  are you syrian and you wish to stay in italy to work and make a family ? 
  cool !,
