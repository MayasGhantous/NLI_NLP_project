because capitalism is reaching saturation . 
  if the races to the bottom to appease corporations and the bourgeoisie continue to go on people will continue to get more and more angry ; and given the lack of strong radical left parties , or lack of unity of such , the rage gets captured by right wing demagogues . 
  it 's cyclical and it 's intrinsecally linked to our present economic system . 
  oh with that i agree , however likely with stark a difference from your opinion , liberal democracy is built to uphold the interests of the bourgeoise class . 
  however i have faith in the people/humanity , we will overcome capitalism too at last . 
  so in your opinion if you vote , for example , for a candidate which promises less taxes and he/she loses you are entitled into paying less ? 
  that 's not how it works . 
  you work trying to build consensus and winning next time . 
  that 's why there 's no italian flag . 
  i am honestly skeptical . 
  the ( low ) level of english at the university level also worries me , i often suggest to my collegues `` look at this article on wikipedia , but check it out in english , it 's more complete '' and it get scared/panicked glances . 
  at levels lower than university , beside who has to work in contact with foreigners only gamers/nerds know english at a decent level . 
   venice  the tide thisisfine_but_underwater . jpg, 
  the cost of not doing so , however , is cheap . 
  less than 100 ' 000 $ in bribes . 
  that and marble plaster , for the fancier places . 
  i replied to the parent . 
  oh there are supermarkets/shops that have only slightly higher than normal prices , but they are either found in the residential areas of the city or they are hidden in the not-usually-used-by-tourists roads . 
  it takes me ~ 1/4th of the time of an average person to go arround the city , and not only because it walk faster but because i know the lesser known ( therefore with less people ) alleys . 
  anyhow yes , for who has the time to dedicate one morning a week shopping for gorceries , going to mestre saves you from 20 % to 30 % ( the biggest difference in prices i noticed is red meat , i have no clue why ), 
  salt is also a deadly enemy for infrastructure , things just start crumbling down after a while . 
  it 's illegal to use concrete to make plaster , because the salt eats it so fast that it would start crumbling and falling on people 's heads . 
  / lives in venice . 
  my house 's front wall is slowly sliding off . 
  just to give prospective, 
  a mass murder that kills less people than another is a genocide if it completely eradicates a particular ethnicity . 
  all genocides are mass killings , not all mass killings are genocides . 
  * who * is killed is more important than how many people are killed in telling the difference . 
  and no wallets leave it . 
   are we just ruled by hedge fund billionaires or are we ruled by ai robots ? 
  corporations in capitalism are paperclip maximizers . 
  so i would say `` yes '' to that question . 
  it lasted four centuries , i 'm fairly skeptical that all those people were muslim in name only . 
  book burning was done by all kinds of ideologies , even anti-scientific murders are n't unheard of ( hypatia ) . 
  this obviously is n't an excuse for their crimes against knowledge and humanity but neither diminishes their relevance they had in the building of the knowledge we presently have . 
  the fact that today , in some countries , they are living in their dark ages under factually theocratic does n't make them retroactivelly and universally `` bad '' . 
  i am not aware of any direct influence , and i did n't mean that , however the `` golden age '' they went through was instrumental for a lot of ideas/concepts which there then taken and are now . 
  the [ golden age of islam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_golden_age#metaphysics ) is interesting . 
  i find it deeply ironic that in all likelyhood the values of those `` muslim conservative values '' are in fact best represented by fn , they also hate muslims which muslims ( extremist ) often do too ( based on which current they follow ) . 
  it 's like fascist ideologies share a lot of similarities , shocking . 
  europe had the enlightenment also thanks to the work of many islamic scholars , before they went full thoughtcrime after the 13th century . 
  i never claimed about being anti-immigration , i do n't believe in closed borders . 
  i believe that integration is more than possible , and that not enought is being done about it since a political side benefits from it and therefore defunds those attempts . 
  however i believe human traffiking to be extremely immoral , first and foremost because most of the immigrants have a good chance to end up being exploited regardless of the place they end up with . 
  no social safety net and difficulty to communicate simply compound the issue , they are not the cause ; local criminality who seeks cheap and/or illegal labour are the issue . 
  furthermore immigration has to be regulated because the countries the people emigrate from may well need the labour that goes abroad , mostlikely a fraction of those people were educated throught public money therefore causing a loss to that particular society . 
  i am in internationalist , i have no problems with international relations and various agreement on the condition that both nations benefit from them . 
  i try to refine my positions to the daily , however i 'm in no ways right-wing . 
  i strive to keep my views rational , consistent and based on fact . 
  my starting point was very close to your position right now . 
  i think that it started changing since when i started reading into seular humanism / egalitarianism . 
  i agree that who does something which has an extreme social benefit he/she should be rewarded proportionally to that , i do not agree that someone 's discovery should become someone else 's ( the employer 's ) intellectual proprety . 
  i do not agree that the value of your labour should be skimmed off by who happens to employ you . 
  i do not agree that unemployment should be a thing , people who seek work should have it avaliable to them ( and it increases the wage of everybody since the private sector has to compete for employees ) . 
  i do not agree that private entities should be legally bound exclusivelly to the maximization of profits , and even if they do something illegal to do so they are penalized by a fraction of the profit made through the abuse . 
  i am wholly convinced that capitalism is inherently abusive , finding a ballance is like keeping a supercritical nuclear reactor stable , it needs continuous effort and the expenditure of resources . 
  you can allow capable/skilled/lucky person to profit without allowing them to use their accumulated profit to rewrite the rules in their favour . 
  i 'm both a meritocratic and an egalitarian person , the two things are n't mutually exclusive , people should n't be allowed to be successfull only because they were born in the capitalistic neo-aristocracy . 
  i am for a moderate ammount of private proprety , but there should be a socially choosen limit , uncapped individual wealth is an extremely dangerous poison . 
  i do n't want free riders neither , and the biggest free riders are the ownership class , a few were able to buy into it , most were born into it , neither ** deseve ** to be able to accumulate orders of magnitude more resources than anybody else . 
  i do n't see why you call yourself right wing them . 
  your position seems left , maybe a bit towards the center . 
   my question was about ideologically `` pure '' communism that can never be implemented and somehow always ends up in a dictatorship that truly benefits very few and brutally exploits nearly everybody else . 
  i disagree with that , given that pure communism happened like trice and in my opinion is n't sustainable if there are other nations with different ideologies ( pure communism requires the lack of a state ) . 
  you 're thinking about state socialism easily devolving in state capitalism , which i can agree with . 
  i 'm for state socialism with a strong constitutional and democratic basis . 
  i find it more possible now than the early 20th century because nowdays the instability caused by flash industrialization would n't happen . 
  i am in a country that affords social protections by standing strong against the most extreme greed of the capitalists . 
  i 'm in the `` bourgeois '' class myself , but i 'm a firm believer in the fact that extreme individualism , the one which is encouraged by capitalism , tends to be a net-negative in long-term economic growth . 
  while i find a mix of social policy and capitalism acceptable , since i in live in such a system , i find it inherently unstable , and therefore undesireable : there continues to be an untold ammount of internal and international pressure to break the system down . 
  as an example of that i often use the increasingly strong movement for the privatization of governmentally-built infrastructure . 
  the privatization of profits and the socialization of losses . 
  capitalism 's goal is simply one : the maximization of ( short term ) profits . 
  the abuses of present and past present self-described `` communist '' states are reality but they are also to be analized under an objective lens , were those policies actually in line with the socialist ideology ? 
  in many examples they were and are not , as the extreme example of north korea shows the country is still divided in classes , socialism and communism are words used only demagogically while the ruling class is wholly composed by demagogic kleptocrats . 
  on the other hand does capitalism really have less blood into his hands ? 
  before strong regulations were applied the robber barons were litteraly printing money with the blood of labour , starvation and sickness of the workers for someone else 's gain was a reality under the capitalistic system . 
  capitalism is built on the foundations of blood and bones of working people . 
  capitalism is inherently exploitative , socialism is inherently egalitarian . 
  while both words can be used by demagogues to mean different things their original definition and original ideals still stay strong . 
  true socialism may be an utopia , i give you that , it may never be applicable in it 's ideal conception . 
  however it 's something to strive towards . 
  pure capitalism never was and never will be such a goal . 
  ps : if you want to talk about this for longer , i 'll be glad to do so but if you would be so kind please let 's move the rest to pms , i do n't want to go too much off-topic . 
  i am indeed a communist , or if you want to use the pc term a libertarian-socialist . 
  however i think that it needs a lot of fundational work before to be feasible ( automation etc ) therefore i go the more statist route , at the moment . 
  simply from an egalitarian prospective i see this immigration issue a complete sham , it drains human capital from the countries which need it the most ( the developping ones ) and perpetrates the exploitation of both the immigrants and the populace of where the immigrants end up to be exploited . 
  however i want to be ** very clear ** , in my view the problem are n't the immigrants but whoever encourages the immigration itself , there is an incalculable ammount of profit behind this illegal behaviour of which the immigrants are also victims . 
  note : people are n't inherently anything , desperate people will do desperate things to survive ( crimes ) i find the idea of `` they are coming here with the express purpose of being leeches '' completely absurd , it 's simply something the extreme majority of humans do n't actually think about . 
  human trafikers , ngos , illegal employers , neoliberals , imperialists . 
  this is 21st century slavery , pure and simple . 
  thanks , as a socialist ( the radical left kind ) i hold a similar opinion from a different point of view . 
  people are getting illegaly imported ( human trafficking ) to be exploited from various illegal organization and/or by getting illegally `` employed '' , a kind of employment close to slavery . 
  furthermore it helps the fat cats with their race to the bottom , so much cheap desperate labour is avaliable that it brings down the wage of whole sections of population . 
  legal residents have to `` work in black ( willingly giving up most of their benefits ) '' as we say it in italy because there is an unfair ammount of competition . 
  furthermore the people who immigrate here in europe for economic reasons are often encouraged to do so on false pretenses and end up more desperate here than they would have been by calling for change in their home country . 
  to be clear , i 'm all for supporing people from war torn countries , but it has to be done in a fair , transparent , humane way . 
  it has ** nothing ** to do with nationalism , it is a rethoric which is abused by nationalists and they deserve bashing for extremizing and misinterpreting the issue , however it is an actual issue . 
  going arround in circles without ever accompishing anything actually useful . 
  it 's apt , just i do n't know if in a poetic or an ironic way .
