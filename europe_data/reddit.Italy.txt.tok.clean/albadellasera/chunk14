  again we are talking about the french here . 
  years of battles between our governments and eu institutions . 
  but we all know that some animals are more equal than others . 
  we are talking of the french here is exactly :  if by `` nationalism '' you mean `` an extreme form of patriotism marked by a feeling of superiority over other countries '', 
  in this case they will be one screwed fincantieri can look elsewhere and their shipyard will be probably bought for pennies by the dutch or germans in a couple of years . 
  it 's just nationalism pure and simple dear . 
  that 's it . 
    the 2006 world cup final should have been a triumph for italians , but all people remember now is the iconic french soccer captain zinedine zidane headbutting an opponent in the last minutes . 
  absolute bullshit . 
  it is a pathetic excuse because at the same time they were proposing joint military projects . 
  who does that if you are afraid that your intel would end up in chinese hands ? 
  then why insult us by claiming we will pass intel to chinese ? 
  * pure disgust *, 
  was it really necessary to bring in soccer in such serious argument ? 
  of who the koreans ? 
  since it 's not like the french own it currently . 
  becouse you know we are chinese spies / s, 
  it 's already just not refugees oil and gas are a way more important concern than those desperate guys . 
  libya is a key point in our energetic security . 
  and also a lot of public call centres :( i used to love it as a child now i ca n't listen to it anymore . 
  and not only for you :(, 
  we got 64 % under hollande dear . 
  and fincantieri can pull itself out . 
  one reason more for us to refuse this deal since why should we give you access to our military projects since : a. 
  you often hurted our interests in the last few years b. 
  we get very little in return and yes i use we since fincantieri is public company, 
  it was buyed at the auctions and a deal was made with the french government and the representation of the workers unions . 
  and now you are reopening the party by asking more that was asked to the koreans in exchange of vague promises of common military projects . 
  the reality is that either macron has a parallel buyer waiting that want to help or is taking a very high gamble since fincantieri will go on pretty well without this deal . 
   and it seems that fincantieri was not able to guarantee that licences or classified information would n't transit to their chinese associates . 
  and exactly how giving 50 % of the control to the french government will somehow prevent fincantieri associates to get to that kind of info ? 
  and if you guys are so worried over security why are you proposing in exchange common military projects ? 
  it 's not the kind of things you do if you are worried of losing intel ... 
  no problem , 
  yes but the deal with finmeccanica was signed under the hollande presidency and was approved by it as well from the korean owners of course . 
  macron is trying to reopen an already closed deal . 
  this is the point of the issue . 
  they already lost it finmeccanica buyed it from the koreans and the previous deal was approved by the previous french government . 
  [ [ viavaldi 's ** primavera ** ] ] ( https://youtu.be/5eaxcioiy2w ) dear consumer you have been calling the european commission we are busy at the moment please stay in line . 
  thank you !, 
  [ [ viavaldi 's ** primavera ** ] ] ( https://youtu.be/5eaxcioiy2w ) [ line fells ], 
  if it was why hollande with us and whatever sold it to the koreans did n't pretended the same ? 
  and if they ca n't pay what is next ? 
  prison for debts ? 
  to give a full picture fincantieri is one of the biggest companies in its sector the french company is bankrupt and the deal was already closed . 
  it 's a blatant case of state aid but yet `` curiously '' i do n't ear any condemnation from the eu so far . 
   as an italian , are you disapointed in the lack of commitment of italy on that affair ? 
  angry is more like it . 
   if so , is it because of the monopolistic behaviour of france or the reaction of the italian government on the matter ? 
  both . 
  for you certain for us way less . 
  enjoy your new oil fields i guess . 
    they are the one who created this mess in the first place   why did n't you stop them ? 
  libya had close relations to italy , both historical and economic . 
  you let the french bomb them , now your friends are dead , and your new friends do n't control the country but only a small corner of it . 
  a.we are not a permanent member of the security council b. 
  we ca n't fight offensive wars abroad for a thing called ww2   ( like it was easy while dealing with a failed state which is not the case of spain and marocco )   it 's not as if relations with spain and marocco are so well , the two having been involved in military operations against one another and claiming each others land while bickering over a disputed former spanish dependency currently occupied by morocco . 
  want to trade that with trying to bribe tons of competing tribes ? 
    is for economic interest . 
  to be specific oil and gas . 
  and who control most of this sector right now there ? 
    is that control worth the existential crisis you 're putting on the continent ? 
  europe put herself on a corner . 
  that said yes it is all the way if is that is the choice that spare us from becoming a russian colony . 
  how you very well enlightened . 
  the reason why we want the french the fuck out of libya aside the fact that they are the one who created this mess in the first place is that they are not there for charity or because we ca n't get the things done ( like it was easy while dealing with a failed state which is not the case of spain and marocco ) is for economic interest . 
  to be specific oil and gas . 
  and who control most of this sector right now there ? 
  if the eastern europeans were smart they will also oppose this move instead of lecturing us . 
  why ? 
  because if total gets their hands on eni plants we will get even closer to the russians for a long list of reason starting from the fact that we use gas to produce most of our electricity . 
  was it possible we will but now is n't . 
  france is too far away to have a real problem and spain has a deal with marocco . 
  and now with this recent french `` gift '' the already scarce possibilities are zero . 
  and the austrian idea of lampedusa is simply ludicrous . 
  no their nice pm said that the border will be closed if we do n't keep all the migrants in lampedusa . 
  setting aside that keeping thousands of people on that rock is simply impossible . 
  but even if it was is none of their business how we move non-austrian citizens on our soil . 
  plain and simple . 
  `` alfano [ our foreign m. ] bowed to the austrians '' was the literal front page title of a right wing newspaper next day and was also the thought of many italians ( even progressive ones ) while earing the news . 
  you are welcome i guess . 
  however interesting is not the way i will define it . 
  between the total isolation with the migrant crisis , austria trying to meddle in our internal affairs , orban 's morality lessons and now this : the feeling of national humiliation is great and united with the aftershock of massive crisis and a shift to the right of the whole political spectrum there is the recepy for trouble to put really mildly . 
  frankly considering our history i am scared . 
  really scared . 
  i hope that i am wrong but i have a huge bad feeling . 
  that they are going to transform libya in their puppet state screwing us in the ass with sand . 
  and that yet again an eu leader as pissed on our head . 
  in a more polite way of course . 
  another week like this and we will be out of the eu and probably also nato in five , seven years max . 
  upset is a mild way to define it . 
  gomorra is in neapolitan ( different language ) is actually subtitled in italy as well . 
  probably so . 
  but they should really learn a thing or two by the valdostani who menaged to keep their peculiar culture and have a similar autonomy yet they are not so secluded between themselves . 
  i have a few friends from south tyrol thanks to the fact that i did my bachelor in trento and they are from all sides of italian speakers , german speakers , a ladino and an half italian half german speaker and they all agree that one great problem that there inside the area is lack of communication between people . 
  they are not only secluded between themselves but also between the rest of the country . 
  frankly the only times they get on the media is when something really ludicrous appens up there and/or they complain about something . 
  which i would lie if i said that this did n't hurt their reputation . 
  they have been projected by the same guy who built the foresta verticale . 
   but then who will eat the cats ?
