  there is also a possible 3rd option something like the case of albenia ( where we do the the air policing together with greece ) or slovenia ( us + hungary ) . 
  well the eu has tough rules on founds if they apply them properly we will probably avoid some of the usual wastes . 
  we are usually good at that check recent pictures from assisi or gemona you would n't belive that both had been badly hit by earthquakes . 
  yes but it will have a devastating effect vaccines are more criticised than ever and saying that science is not important in the establishment of proof not only undermine science yet again but also undurmine the process of collection of evidence . 
  i belive that this verdict is a shame and will be used by antivaxxers all over for their propaganda . 
  it 's like if i could sue nike if during jogging i had broken my leg !, 
  i had common bathrooms in school from elementary s. to university and i do n't see the reason for all the fuss that has been done on the subject . 
  frankly the only problem i see is that some of you boys tend to shoot out of the wc . 
  i do n't want to live in a desert to satisfy dutch sexual fantasies !, 
  i had read the report for last year and to quantify the level of bullshit in it i 'll just say the according to them gay marriage is constitutionally illigal here except our constitutional court established that it is n't almost 10 years ago . 
  keep your dirty hands off the med !, 
   surely locals ' view about their own condition , demonym and toponym does n't matter , does it ? 
  metters when is the point in question . 
  in the case of why the title was written that way it does n't . 
  are you slow ? 
  we are also sanding waterbombers to you . 
  keep safe * fratelli * !, 
  not all europe pretended not to see we : sent waterbombers and we are going to do this time again . 
    provincial division is perceived as secondary   such impression - in this case - is wrong , then . 
  if you 're still in doubt , ask locals . 
  i was talking about people from ** outside ** the region dear . 
    saying directly the province is too informal . 
    not in this case given that i ) trento and bolzano/bozen are the only * autonomous provinces * of italy and ii ) there are differences in language , cultural heritage and belongingness -- hence the provincial autonomies . 
  as i said i belive 4 times already the provincial division is perceived as secondary and therefore secondarily stated b. 
  nobody is ever going to use the words provincia autonoma di bolzano/trento unless is an official document or a conversation about the status of the autonomy d. are you trying to teach me how my native language works ? 
  idk man i mean the american ones are not a bit too much decorated ? 
  maybe ours are too sober by when i went to the us i found their plates a bit excessive . 
  i meant that trentino alone in a semi-formal sentence is sloppy unless is necessary to be specific . 
  saying that giovanni is trentino means that is from the province aka is specific because is part of identity while for describing a location the region is the way to go usually saying directly the province is too informal . 
  i belive that you missed my point i never said that trentino is the region or that altoatesini is not the main way ( not the only tho ) to call s.tyroleans in my native language i just said that writing that torbole is in trentino - s.t. 
  is perfectly understandable since we italians see the country first and foremost divided by ** regions ** not provinces and what is the translation to english ?

    i just said that italians are not used to say them separately   because they refer to the * region * . 
  trentino is * not * the region . 
  oh really ? 
  i belive you have missed my point i never said that torbole is not in trentino , i just said that describing were a city or in this case a town people here would more likely place them by region hence why op wrote trentino-s.t. 
  and not just trentino . 
   addendum : in fact , someone who is from alto adige is called * altoatesino * in italian . 
  i know . 
  i always found the word incredibly ugly sounding beside i usually use sud tirolesi per rispetto to local sensibilities and my ear ones . 
  and i never found a person that did n't understand that i was talking about altoatesini .
