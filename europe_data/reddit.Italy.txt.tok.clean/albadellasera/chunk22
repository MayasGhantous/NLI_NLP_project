  and i never found a person that did n't understand that i was talking about altoatesini . 
    i just said that italians are not used to say them separately   because they refer to the * region * . 
  trentino is * not * the region . 
  oh really ?

  i am perfectly aware that a.a. / s t. is the province and that trentino a.a. / s.t. 
  is the region thank you very much . 
  i just said that italians are not used to say them separately unless talking about something specific . 
  we see our country divided first and foremost in regions from our point of wiew the fact that the two are autonomous provinces is secondary to the fact that they belong to a region with special status . 
  so frankly i fail to see where the misconception lies frankly . 
  i love read from which country the cars are while walking in front of them while they are parked .
