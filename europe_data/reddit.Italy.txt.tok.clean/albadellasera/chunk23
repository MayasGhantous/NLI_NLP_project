  be surprised that someone has driven from poland to italy , feel the pain for all the poor drivers that end up behind the dutch car on the road across the mountains ... 
  yes like this [ one ] ( https://www.google.it/search?client=ms-android-samsung&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=363&amp;site=webhp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=m5dfwf79fcjtu7pxpege&amp;q=sticker+macchina+lettera+i&amp;oq=sticker+macchina+lettera+i&amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-img.3...7383.13595.0.13858.11.11.0.0.0.0.731.2085.5j2j1j0j1j0j1.10.0....0...1.1j4.64.mobile-gws-img..1.1.729...0j35i39k1.lab87_83pki#tbm=isch&amp;q=sticker+macchina+italia&amp;imgrc=vxmn3o6ajzisrm: ), 
  and trentini would never consider themselves south tyroleans actually by first hand experience calling them as such is a good way to annoy them . 
  that said they are in the same administrative region and usally written together . 
  for us is rare to write or call them separately unless talking about something really specific and in our eyes it would heve been a bit sloppy had he just wrote trentino . 
  ** tl ; dr ** italians use trentino alto adige 90 % of the time . 
  btw on a historical prospective is ironic that an austrian highlights the cultural separation between trentino and s.t. 
  since the a.h. empire tried to deny for a long time . 
  talking about trentino was actually a good way to attract negative attention by the authorities . 
  i love the eu plates but i am kinda nostalgic of the i sticker on the back of my dad 's car when i was a little girl . 
  so many memories ... 
  the economy is growing and as accelerated recently however it could do better the problem is that the debt do n't leave much space for investment and as for the us let 's see how it goes with the fiat disel gate . 
  that said time will see which one is right , have a good night , 
  i repeat they have increased production and personal over and over . 
  they would not leave because : - they have to much to hide and our government know where the `` corpses '' are buried - as the recent sue from the german government at eu level has showed they need a government that will protect them and neither the dutch nor the brits are going to do that - we are by far their biggest consumer base and since how many money we have being giving to keep afloat fiat over the years and since their cars are not particularly good either really pissing of the only people that really buys their shit is not a benefit for them . 
  they have been listed in wall street long time ago . 
  end they are listed in milan as well . 
  if tomorrow i put a picture from malcesine that is in veneto would you be quiet ? 
  you know that most of the machinery and the components for made in germany products are made in italy ? 
  they enlarged the production in the last few years the netherlands are just their tax haven of choice . 
  somebody has the results from last year ? 
  it would be nice to compare them . 
  even there !? 
  in which part of the lake you 're ? 
   poland probably wants a unification . 
  we can give them the inhabitants but the land is ours :p, 
  and in corn fields . 
  only if you do n't have anything better in your life . 
  but you really have to be awful at every fucking tread that involve , even remotely , italy ? 
  because it makes you look like a sad loser fyi . 
  i absolutely agree with you . 
  we will complain anyway . 
  trust me . 
  there is a reason why one of our most popular says is * piove !, 
  * which can be translated more or less as `` it rains !, 
  government of thieves !, 
  oh we know , a real italian would never glorify the country for anything good . 
  if i remember correctly you can only be deprived of citizenship if you fight for an enemy country or if your adoption get nullified ( and you have another c. ) . 
  however i read this stuff long time ago but anyway moving to a friendly country and being dumb are n't usually causes of lost citizenship . 
  yep but just packing and moving across the border would not have allowed them to indulge in drama . 
  and s. tyroleans loves it . 
  ah bonus point : the leader of this group of let 's say concerned citizens has compared the new law to nazi 's experiments and declared : `` we wo n't poison our children '' . 
  yes really . 
  so you will lose against a coalition of northern italy cities ? 
  not the scariest threat i ever heard honestly , 
  no especially at those levels, 
  ciao ,  there was a saying in the 80 . 
   if we took trieste we would have to go shopping all the way to monfalcone . 
  :p my mom is from trieste and she told me often than when se was little in the square near the channel was filled with stands who only sold jeans . 
  i actually moved to trieste a couple of month ago and i am impressed on how much has improved in the last few years . 
  something i did n't noticed fully in the rapid visit that i used to do once a year . 
   p.s.s : i think gorizia/nova gorica border is an excellent example on how two countries can peacefully coexist . 
   in berlin you had the wall during the cold war , here you had a border that locals could freely cross . 
  yea i like how we menaged to keep the subterranean tensions down for the most part . 
  in gorizia people had lived with houses in two countries for decades in peace and not many places can boast the same . 
  we should be proud of it . 
  here in italy has been offered freely for boys to in the last few years . 
  also geothermal energy thanks to volcanos and eolic on the islands . 
  plausible to me it sounds like something the minculpop ( the italian ministry of propaganda ) could come up . 
  boys are healthy carriers so when it comes to heard immunity vaccinate boys is only reasonable . 
   teach that to your kids while growing up and they 'll learn how to properly drink and not get wasted for the sake of getting wasted , and instead will enjoy alcohol properly . 
  this . 
  when i was 14 y.o. 
  my father allowed me to drink a bit at dinner when i was at his house and told me : `` never ever drink with an empty stomach '' . 
  no it has ** nothing ** to do with bribes . 
  and it 's only an opinion by the cassation which from time to time loves to play the dalai lama . 
  an other court would have to decide and this opinion not only infuriated basically the entire country but also most judges . 
  the pathetic thing is that he was put on the european watch list and the brits where also warned by our intelligence but yet they tried for a bit yesterday to claim we had n't told anything . 
  we drink little and while eating . 
  and we actually look down upon you northern europeans for getting shitfaced during weekends : for us is drunkards stuff . 
  getting wasted is really frowned upon here . 
  like we did for decades while fighting internal terrorism and organised crime : accept minor restrictions of your freedom , educate those who might be at risk of falling into it ( and if it comes to it taking away their children ) and the general population to reject them , select your targets instead of doing billions of biographies and punish harshly who you get . 
  but above all accepting the fact that you 're going to lose some battle but if you go down to their abysmal level you 're going to lose since you 're playing on their field . 
  i am not saying we are perfect or we do not struggle in doing this but i belive is the best way to keep the ghosts of the past where they should stay : there . 
  if she uses sentences like : - win and we 'll win !, 
  - clean the swamps !, 
  - better living one day as a lion than 100 as a sheep try to convince every socialist , jewish , jw , communist or christian democrat friend you may have to escape with you and then ... ** run fools !, 
  yes the pleb is insulting humanity as whole claming that may is one of us !, 
  if they are sick and old yes . 
  but not in this kind of cases it 's disgusting that it 's even being considered imo . 
  and someone told me here yesterday that saying that slogans like strong and stable have a fascist vibe was over the top . 
  right . 
  i have a better idea instead that slashing human rights why you guys do n't take down a notch the arrogance and try to follow up the tips others have given you . 
  maybe it will work better than having a terror attack , claim that you were n't warned and then while ending up shitfaced , because you where indeed warned , propose stasi like lagislation . 
   did they send the signal through an encrypted channel ? 
  do you think they should have bought a page on the daily mail instead ?

  well if russian witches can fly in mortars ... 
  according to the italian press our intelligence had repeatedly signalled the guy to the british intelligence . 
  sh\u00e4uble is going to do the test flights ? 
  and maybe even some hoover , 
  or more simply the fondamentalistic nature of protestantism does n't allow what most of catholics do this days : call yourself as such while doing nothing of catholicism preach and do a lot of what it forbids . 
  that 's way you guys killed of the repubblica romana in 1848 ?!, 
  you the lovers of republican freedom ?!, 
  shame !, 
  and deprive ourselves of the fun of angry sanmarinesi claming to having been invaded by an italian ambulance ? 
  no way !, 
  you 're welcome , 
  look up the slogans of mininculpop the official propaganda ministry of the fascist era and you will find out that strong and stable would fit in well . 
  and may is not the worst in coping those kind of slogan trump let 's clean the swamp is * literally * a mussolini 's slogan,
