  for the rest of europe i can believe you but here hotel rooms have to have one by law . 
  two wrong do n't make a right, 
  ticinesi on our * autostrade * tend to behave like they are on the set of fast and furious . 
  if i see someone going 200 km/h signalling with the lights to pass the plate is usually from ticino . 
  the situation is so bad that the society that handles our highways had go to collection agency for all the money that ticinesi owed them . 
  and the motivations that came out were nuts things like stay on the ass of cars with [ telepass ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/telepass ) for not paying the toll . 
  you see portugal for us your like that cusin that you see twice a year for cristhmass and easter , that you kinda like but you do n't know well . 
   and ya the ticinese do n't seem to like italians much , but that 's one canton of 26 . 
  and we do n't like their drivers so i guess is fair ... 
  such voucher already exist ( and i personally belive they should not since their compatibility with the constitution is dubious at best ) but do not cover all the tuition . 
  beside , if it was for me we will return to the old system which did n't allow unvaccinated children in any school and since education is mandatory you ended up with the social services at your door . 
  the role of the state is to protect the weakest in this case people who ca n't get vaccinated or children whose parents belive every bullshit the read on fb . 
  if you do not receive public founding , yes . 
  damn never write before coffee, 
  yes the ^ a for feminine is used in italian as well . 
  and we also use roman numerals for writing ordinals ( especially with centuries ) i.e xv secolo = the 15th century edit : fixed, 
  well the bank in the picture is in verona ( i am from there ) but i agree you should definitely visit rome , 
  i guess i am spoiled since growing up i passed frequently in front of a bank where you could see [ this ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=domus+romana+banca+verona&amp;client=ms-android-samsung&amp;site=webhp&amp;prmd=minv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjn_sktzlxtahugjywkhfyzcwqq_auiccgc&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=512#imgrc=jmv66z44jhdnqm: ) looking down from the windows on the street , 
  it was n't that special there where basically two small furnaces one biside the other and whole thing was about 1.5 m long and 40 cm high . 
  edit : words, 
  tried to find something i will check better later, 
  in the middle of my high school gym there was a piece of glass floor that allow to see the roman glass factory below ... 
  me too, 
  you 're welcome neighbour , 
  how long are you gon na stay in verona ? 
  do you want any tips ? 
  v . it is my home town . 
  not really, 
  some not all . 
  those were n't gift at all they were just thefts . 
  you guys lost the napoleonic wars . 
  and in fact according to the congress of vienna you should have given back those artworks . 
  look up napoleon looting . 
  the fact that napoleon 's troops stole every art work the could up their hands on is not exactly a mistery that of course does n't include la gioconda wich was actually bought . 
  imo the best are the guy 's from sweden , slovenia and greece are the best looking ones . 
  link : http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5379/496/1600/europe.0.jpg, 
  yep i also noticed that elsewhere taste way better ( and cost less ) . 
  pasta all ` amatriciana, 
  a danger for my country . 
  my ex is a perfect example of this : blond hair , blue eyes and 1.90 m tall . 
  i jokingly nicknamed him * vichingo * ( viking ) for this . 
  it 's a stereotype born in the us and popularised by their media . 
  an idea born by the fact that italian americans are mostly the grand children of southerners . 
  20 % of population is naturally blonde and in some regions like veneto ( the region of venice ) the percentage is higher . 
  and blu eyes as well are common . 
  an american girl asked me if she should cover her hair while visiting venice . 
  according to her she risked to be molested because according to her we italians we are not used to see blond hair . 
  france : they get food snobbery switzerland : good chocolate and clocks austria : sacher slovenia : they are the ideal quite neighbour so quite that we often forget the exist . 
  probably our best neighbour all considering san marino : huge amusement when periodically they complain to be invaded by ambulances vatican city : * erm *, 
  the fact you got upvoted show once again that jokes that would be unacceptable about others become fair game with us . 
  it will be sad if it was n't disgusting . 
  yeah when the government trough enel said that they wanted to create a fiber network all the private companies started doing what the have n't done for years : invest . 
  i will definitely avoid ** you ** that 's scure . 
  and a tip : learn how to detect irony . 
  it 's not hard do n't worry dear . 
  how do you know that we do n't complain about austria ? 
  what do you need google for when you can learn how to learn how to read maps and avoid your highways all together ? 
  be careful with all that salt or your green country will turn yellow, 
  not in english who does n't have a distinction between ti voglio bene ( i feel affection for you ) the sort of i love you you will say to a parent or friend and ti amo ( i love you as i am ** in ** love with you ), 
  andata , 
  you guys from the uk are not scared of the mere thought of eating rabbit ? 
  as long you do n't call it pizza is fine . 
  but polenta + plus rabbit sauce remain the best . 
   sanctions do n't really work . 
  they have n't worked in cuba , they have n't worked in iran , they do n't work in russia . 
  what they do in these r\u00e9gimes is give leaders an opportunity to paint the picture of a demonic enemy on the wall , pulling the country together . 
  you can add to your list pre-ww2 italy since the sections for over the war in ethiopia . 
  and why it end up always that why ? 
  because people do n't care that much of international community but cares if their living standards drop . 
  good since i already use krk  actually i will be there this afternoon , 
  on which part ? 
   we have a solid relationship with italy , but i feel like there is still a passive-aggressive distrust on both sides . 
  there is no reason for our relationship not to be even better than neutral , but the people still observe each other with squinty eyes . 
  i might be wrong , but that 's my impression . 
  i think that the distrust is mostly on your side guys , really . 
  we actually like you quite a lot . 
  is it offensive or not for croats if i use idk fiume instead of rijeka while talking ? 
  you can only buy regional train tickets few days prior online , anyway you can buy them directly at the station since is a regional price stay the same and they never get overbooked just overcrowded . 
  i am probably the only person in italy who has been fined for it . 
  it is a record i could have lived without . 
  not that much anymore was more a 90s thing . 
  and the second generation has integrated so well that idk if using second generation to define them has even sense . 
  i would not put the albenians in that category anymore . 
  they integrated well especially the second generation . 
   i 've always wondered if the police suddenly started caring , would italians respect their authority ? 
  we do they just are not enough . 
  and that 's the key as is showed by the appalling behaviour on our roads by swiss and germans tourists . 
  also systems like tutor and the point based driving licence have definitely improved the situation in the last few years . 
  this idea that we are a bunch of anarchists by nature is frankly offensive . 
  we learned from last time . 
  beside inter-ethinic persecution is n't a sign of integration in the balkans ? 
  can we have our compatriots back ? 
  unfortunately not :( . 
  however it was fun for the first 5 minutes max then it became torture ... 
  i took the train verona-bolzano for 5 years and i have seen enough to testify that they are n't definitely not cleaner nor quieter . 
  the s.t. 
  class who sung osteria numero 2 for an hour completely out of tone and with a thick german accent which made it sound even worse will remain in my nightmares ... 
  i could still hear them even while listening metal in my earphones ... 
   ( sometimes ) south tyrol . 
  really ?
