  that said good synthesis . 
  we never took down the pope we annexed most of his territory yes due to his refusal to accept any kind of compromise . 
  we are more culturally catholic than strongly catholic if you want to see a strongly catholic cauntry go to poland ( just to give you an example we had the strongest communist party in w. europe so much for a supposedly super catholic cauntry ) . 
  and we always had a love-hate relationship with the curch wich in some moment of our history became more evident like the unification era wich was characterised by a strong anticlericalism . 
  ** now this is like a suuuper synthetic version of a really complicate story if you want to learn really something at least read the viki pages about : ** - pope pio ix - the 1848 roman republic - breach of porta pia - the roman question - the patti lateranensi and you will be barely scratching the surface of the complicated relationship of italy and the curch . 
  no thanks we already had a fascist ruler . 
   does your country do it ? 
  i just remembered amanda knox ( whom i do n't trust as far as i could throw ) who was called to be tried after being found innocent . 
  no matter how much the american press love to claim otherwise the knox case was n't double jeopardy it is just that the italian system works differently than the american one . 
  let 's start with the basics how this type of trial works here . 
  there is the accused , the accuser and the judge or judges wich acts as the neural third . 
  in the eyes of the law the accused and accuser are considered as ** equal ** therefore they both have the right to ask to appeal in the 90 days after the verdicts and no particular motivation is required . 
  there is first the appeal at the appeal curt and then the supreme curt that can only judge over interpretation of the law and not the facts of the trial and can nullify the trial of the appeal curt if believes that the law as been misinterpreted ( wich is what appened in the k. case ) . 
  ** all this three levels of judgment are considered part of the same process ** . 
  wich is way the prosecutor today ca n't start a new knox trial because he had is 3 degree of appeal and failed to prove that her and his boyfriend were guilty . 
  ** starting a trial now would be double jeopardy ** . 
  edit : missing words, 
  it is annoying . 
  however is nothing in comparison to how we are usally described by certain american redditors : as tribe of bigoted racist sexual perverts unable to organise anything whose only goal in life is to scam tourists and get bribes . 
  you just grow a thick skin and stop caring about ignorants . 
  what really breach my defenses is when italo-americans glorify organised crime or worse say that we do the same that really angers me . 
  yes , however less than in the past . 
  italy here . 
  here is going quite well actually . 
  we are one of the top cauntries when it comes to solar in part thanks to incentives , in part thanks to the high energy prices that make solar convenient and in part thanks to new local regulations for home renovations . 
  and it keeps booming . 
  we are ten in wind energy and we surpassed a couple of years ago the eu target for italy on green energy for 2020 . 
  and we are ranked 2nd on pair with japan on energetic efficiency . 
  and italy, 
  italy here . 
  i did n't wanted to answer at first but after reading the cringy polish comment i feel obliged to try . 
  note : it 's in insanely complicated argument and still quite divisive so i will do my best but it will by no way perfect . 
  where to start ? 
  ok let 's see the difference between the two ok fascism was an authoritarian regime that lasted in power for about 20 y. nazism was a totalitarian regime that lasted way less . 
  the fact that was authoritarian means that albeit repressed albeit hidden the regime always had still some pluralism and ergo dissent always remained under the surface as for time the fact that fascism lasted so long means that from the pension system to the civil code traces ramain to this day in the shape of the state . 
  now let 's go to the end of the war . 
  after the armistice north-central italy gets invaded by the german army and the puppet state also known as repubblica di sal\u00f2 gets created . 
  a number of partisans brigates emerge start fight against both g.army and the fascist of sal\u00f2 . 
  in practice a civil war explode however it took us decades to admit this . 
  the war is ended the cristian democrats have won the first republican election ( in an election strongly manipulated by us and uk ) alcide de gasperi become pm and the italian communist party while losing the election is clearly the strongest in western europe . 
  de gasperi , who used to be persecuted by fascism , find himself at lead of a country a step away from collapse : 70 % of railways and main roads destroyed , cholera and the calories consume per capita below the abysmal level of 1918 . 
  he decided that the cauntry could not stand other instability and declared a general amnesty . 
  act in wich was probably supported by us and uk that already decided not to hold an italian nuremberg trial in fear that would reinforce the communist party and therefore had given all the evidence to our government ( documents that will reappear only casually in the 90s ) . 
  the whole fascism story was minimised for a few decades and in school the rhetoric was we where all on the side of the partisans and the entire idea of an italian civil war was confined to the 2 extreme side of the political spectrum . 
  in the 70s things start to change authoritarianism in school and society gets accused and a more honest review of the f.era start to emerge and at the beginning of the 80s the idea of the civil war become mainstream . 
  today fascism get studied mostly in his internal aspect from why it rose to minutiae like the change lira-pound passing for the policies of italianization . 
  on one side yes we are more relaxed that germans on certain aspects yes we are sorry for what our grandpa generation did and we do n't want it to appen again but we find the idea that someone born in the 90s may feel personally responsible redicoulos , and we never tried to hide fascist books and staff maybe even just for the fact that it will require to destroy ton of staff including 2 entire cities . 
  on the other side the question of how we see the war is still an open wound we all have a grandpa or grandma on 1 side of the civil war and sometimes both and it 's the reason why we find discussion about the period about as pleasant and easy as taking a dive in a pool filled of crocodiles . 
  italy real catholic : old people and wirdos non practising catholic : middle age people and young southerners waldensis : our protestants jw : annoying mormons : american missionaries other protestants : they exist orthodox : romanian immigrants, 
  and italian tv have or used to have a lot of spanish tv series like paso adelante o f\u00edsica y qu\u00edmica . 
  cesare ( caesar ) or tito ( titus ) probably . 
  i sometimes get confused for german , never got offended just i had to ask for another menu if i was in a restaurant since i do n't speak german . 
  inches for things like screens ( and often there is written beside the cm mesure ) . 
  the only time that i saw an italian pre-metric measure was a scale in italian miles on a xviii c. map . 
  you 're welcome , 
  riva is nice and it can be visited quickly . 
  nearby limone e malcesine are beautiful lake town . 
  in malcesine if you go make sure to visit the garden of the palazzo dei capitani ( beautiful and free ) were the venician governor used to live and if you are not scared of highs visit the castle the sight from the tower is great . 
  inland i suggest you to visit the cities of trento and rovereto , you can reach them both by public bus from riva . 
  rovereto is a small town the city centre is nice to see and host the museo della grande guerra wich is the biggest ww1 museum in italy , also the mart the museum of modern art and casa de pero ( an hause-museum of a local futurist artist are worth a visit ) . 
  in trento the duomo is worth a visit were it was held the council of trento that started the controreformation , the buonconsiglio castle is beautiful ( make sure if you go to visit the tower were there is the 4 season fresco ) and if you like old planes visit the museo caproni and for kids is great the muse the new museum of nature designed by renzo piano . 
  if you want to know anything more feel free to ask . 
  wich part of the lake ? 
  the famous mediterranean ocean of course xd, 
  no i do n't think that will cost you anything but you will probably be `` molested '' yes . 
  so from wich part are you ? 
  if it was better for her to cover her hair when visiting venice because she was told that since italian blond women do n't exist ( according to her expert ) she would surely be molested . 
  every time i think about it i facepalm . 
  exactly . 
  the books are beautifully written rant disguised as a religious opera . 
  wich is particularly evident in the 3 political chants wich are the 6th chant of each book : in the one in hell he talks about florence , the one in purgatory is about italy and the one paradise is about europe . 
  he also put quite a few important people still alive at the time in hell . 
  we the land of camplainers ? 
  xd the greatest masterpiece of our literature is a three book long complaint in verse about what the author did n't like about florence/italy/europe of is time . 
  the first thing that came to my mind thinking of italy is resilience why might complain a lot , often have the shit at our neck but one way or another we will always find a way to save ourselves . 
  it 's at handling day to day stuff that we really suck . 
  thanks for your detailed and painstaking report of your american permanence on italian soil, 
   i get that internet is private companies , but sorry dude ? 
  that 's still infrastructure . 
  which depends from private companies not from the state and depends from lack of demand and not on corruption so you remain out of topic  you got me in the vat . 
  ( http://www.vatlive.com/vat-rates/european-vat-rates/ ) 22 percent is still pretty fucking ridiculous compared to other countries , especially since you were just whining how there 's no money to fix the roads . 
  vat do n't go to municipalities goes to the central government and in part to the eu . 
  local authorities fix roads . 
   i 'm sure it 's legal to let uncle mario build your house since , like i said , there 's little infrastructure to prevent people from making unsafe living conditions . 
  as i said if you think that your hause is unsafe check and denunce to the police do n't do claims on reddit . 
   and lastly , your recycling center `` solution '' still does n't change the fact that your government ca n't get the trash guys to be dependable . 
  can you quote me a single case of trash mismanagement of trash in friuli or veneto mr american soldier ? 
   i 'm sorry your feelings are hurt , they are not , frankly you made me laugh when you said of unreported accidents while in reality a lot of accidents are really insurance scams . 
  frankly between us 2 you look like the one of hurted feelings . 
   but i 'm not going to pretend like italy is a dream land where everything runs like clockwork . 
  have i ever claimed that ? 
  i do n't think so . 
   there are so many roads , excluding the autostrada , that are in dire need of repair , wich is due the fact that local aministration have little money right now . 
  not corruption . 
   there 's huge disparity between internet speeds experienced by driving 15 kilometers away from any large city . 
  but 4mbps is n't bad i guess , i can stream a movie . 
  wich is to private companies and lack of demand the link with corruption is exactly ? 
   sometimes , the trash pickup does n't even come . 
  did i mention the 22 % value added tax for any luxury items ? 
  when i say luxury item , i mean food .
