  scure lots of statues are naked , but how many napoleon naked statues exist ? 
  well i admit that they look way shorter in that picture than what they are . 
  26 floors and 18 floors actually . 
  if the french are interested we should still have some buonaparte . 
  if you want to read this way is your choice [ shrug ] . 
  never said that italians are perfect or that i was never embarassed by the behaviour of other italians while travelling . 
  i just illustrated a couple of examples which i encounter while i live in my city . 
  it 's given that we talk about annoying minorities that exist nevertheless . 
  their chocolate is worth killing for, 
   gbied . 
  which stands for ? 
  they are an evident and annoying minority that seems convinced that if you are on vacation everyone around them as to be either on holyday like them or to be their serf . 
  and us a result they ruin also the reputation of others of the same country since no one remembers the 50 nice guys but the one asshole . 
  yep, 
  it 's not the language , as you might have noticed i speak english , is the attitude that some of your tourist have . 
  i do n't work in the tourist business so i do n't have any obligation therefore if i help you is out of kindness and i expect to be treated properly . 
  i do n't have a problem with german tourists who do n't speak english i just smile srugh and move on with my life . 
  look i grown up in one of the most turistic cities in italy and let me share some wisdom that i acquired over the years : if you aspect respect by all foreigners that are on a short visit to your county do n't hold your breath . 
  they would say offensive stuff about your country/compatriots in front of you ( i almost got beaten up by a group of english for answering back ) . 
  treat you like in a condescending way or like you are their servant only for your nationality ( yes germans i 'm looking at you ) . 
  end overall treat the place like if it was disney land bloking sidewalks without moving when you ask to pass , driving at 30 km/h on a 80 km/h road just to admire the panorama ignoring the fact that maybe there are people who need to go to work/school/live a life behind them . 
  my 0,02 $ edit : missing words, 
  until you guys fought his way in ... 
  you 're welcome , 
  have you ever tried risotto with amarone ? 
  it 's great !, 
  he is fixed with the idea that we are bad at everything : just ignore him . 
  it 's the evil mediterranean influence is well known that we spend all euromoney in wine and whores and this are the malevolent results !, 
  homophobia way less imo but yes we a lot to to improve our record with transphobia, 
  the two go hand in hand . 
  yes but we still have vatican city in the middle of our capital and one of the oldest population in the world for the cards that we have is not a bad result mediocre maybe and it can be ( and should ) improved of curse . 
  but constantly thinking the worst of ourselves ( especially in the long list of occasions when is false ) not only does n't fix anything but makes things worse . 
  it 's not the first time either for instance we allowed abortion on request sooner than the germans . 
  us should really stop hating ourselves . 
  in a protestant mentality cauntry wich means absorbing a certain kind of world wiew . 
  like i grown up in atheist family i ca n't escape totally the catholic mentality thanks to the society i grow up into . 
  and yes it has much to do with the old protestant vs catholic match . 
  most of the kind of rhetoric we saw in the last few years is nothing else that weber 's protestantism and the spirit of capitalism in modern souce . 
  it 's the underlying attitude . 
  and it is so common that is almost pathetic . 
  and your speech emerge in defending sword high the duch tax evasion scam wich is nothing else that legalised teft from other cauntries using the so they can keep those minimal level jobs wich as a defence is ludicrous btw . 
  the classic protestant mentality hipocrisy : if catholics use deceitful tricks then is the proof of their weak morals and their `` love for spending money on women and wine '' but if is done by someone from a pure ~ ~ protestant ~ ~ ^ northern cauntry then it become right by definition because god is with us and therefore everything we do is moral and right . 
  it 's what you get by placing germans at top of the naming comitee : they are not the most creative bunch . 
  depends on how restrictive you want to be the options are : - the social war - the lombard kingdom - the 13th century - the napoleonic wars the more popular answer is usually the third . 
  [ hope that google translator did n't mess too much ], 
  thanks , former province !, 
  156 years ago the kingdom of italy was born . 
  yes and no , hungarians patriots where often percived as brothers in arms . 
  never step foot in biella our your never going to get out !, 
  why not the andorran coast with those huge cliffs !, 
  biella is the most dangerous . 
  well : - it 's in the ugliest place on earth ( brussels ) - it 's made in circles - people are forced to do routine pilgrimages ( to strasburg ) - it 's full of people who say they hate it but somehow seem unable to leave ( farage & co. ) add it all together : ** wake up sheeps ** !! 11 !, 
    says women are stupid and should be paid less    does n't get paid because says stupid stuff   consistency !, 
  or how my literature teacher would have called it a [ * contrappasso dantesco * ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/contrapasso ), 
  makes sense . 
  if we could just legalise it ... * sigh *, 
  mistery solved then . 
  then why so up north ? 
  i mean assuming that is albenian stuff why then it did n't wash up in apulia . 
  unless there were going to some less controlled port since transporting weed between albania and apulia is kinda predictable or currents just push the weed on the shore of ragusa/dubrovnik . 
  you missed the guy joke , google sergio leone . 
  it is a one day promotion not a constant thing therefore is as legal as granting free access to couples on valentines day . 
  we can discuss if it should be done the same for mens on international men day and i would agree with you but as being strictly temporary is no different to any other commercial promotion and as such is perfectly legal . 
  the key is the limited time space is going to last if it was permanent it would be definitely be illigal and discriminatory but being only on 8/3 is not . 
   in fact , in books depiction of sack of rome , the german mercenaries did it for lutheran faith , whereas spanish mercenaries did it for the opportunity to loot and rape . 
  so stealing and destroying catholics ' stuff is bad as long you 're also catholic if you 're protestant then it became a moral act ? 
  i wonder how it justify it ... 
   the law does n't care if it is only one day of the year . 
  if a law says that you ca n't discriminate based on gender than you ca n't discriminate based on gender even on one day . 
  and espacially not the state . 
  depends how much space a cauntry leaves in its lagislation to commercial promotions targeting specific groups and it varies hugely . 
   but i think somebody would have to sue first . 
  somebody should care and nobody does . 
  if it was all days of the year then it would be discriminatory but is one day and a day dedicated historically to women btw , it is in many way more a promotion than a policy . 
  and contrary to what the article make it appear is not a new story for years local administrations have put to 0 or 1 $ access to museums or other locations on 8/03 , it 's good advertising and attracts money since women tend to go with husbands/sons/boyfriends ... 
  the state is the owner of the museums and can decide who , when , how much or if someone has to pay . 
  therefore public museums can be free for women on march 8th , for everyone on the first sunday of every month etc. 
  and for the same reason can decide that children/students/retired pay less . 
  true . 
  i had both the best and worst espresso of my life in croatia . 
  it 's possible i guess idk much about the evolution of romanian sorry :(, 
   also on an unrelated note , the romans loved to bathe . 
  pot calling the kettle black dear ? 
  the romans were already killing them in day to day speech especially seems the same forms for different cases caused confusion after the confluence of locative in ablative . 
  then the passing time and the decline of education caused the overlap between nominative and accusative with the victory of the last one ( who later lost its final - m ) you end up with an italian word : i.e. 
  latin nominative mons -  l. accusative montem -  italian monte, 
  carlo magno actually  carlo grosso seems the name of a footballer or a porn actor ... 
  true . but you 're not forced to pay for anything . 
  or just look for a * spiaggia libera *, 
  here in italy as well . 
  yep but was basically a spin-off . 
  do n't you agree ? 
  well we all have to contribute to a cleaner world , 
  good you are already participating at the effort !, 
  keep going !, 
  yep and you all belong to us how does it feels ^ altissimo ^ adige ~ ~ north tyrol ~ ~ ? 
  after all machiavelli was one of us ... 
    biggest organised crime groups claim to have being founded by 3 knights from toledo  actually that 's a myth ... that 's why i used the word ** claim **  and south-italy a mess because of their people ... no . 
  south italy is behind the rest of the country for a long series of particular historical events one of which is undoubtedly the borbons and their idea that uncultured people would not rebel . 
  well , after all , all that copper does n't steal itself  ...
