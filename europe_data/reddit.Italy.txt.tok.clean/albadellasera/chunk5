  once i said that if could produce electricity from our pessimism we could power the planet . 
  maybe we should work on that ... 
  no problem , 
  i do n't think so more often than not is exaggerate and is an easy excuse to do n't fix what does n't work . 
  i do n't belive we are the best but i do n't believe we are the worst either ( differently by quite a few of my compatriots ) . 
  well all our three biggest organised crime groups claim to have being founded by 3 knights from toledo ... beside the bourbons did such a good work that when we took over sicily had 90 % illiteracy . 
  how ? 
  you see there are cauntries who believe to be the best ( and they are n't ) and some who do the exact opposite . 
  we belong to the second group . 
  our self-hatred strikes again ... 
  we have an holy terror of changing the constitution due to the fact that mussolini never eliminated our previous constitution but just modified the shit out of it . 
  plus if you make only one question for a complex reform you 're masochistic . 
  and if you make a referendum about yourself like he did you 're suicidal . 
  the result was the conclusion of a series of bad consideration on renzi 's side . 
  actually the acceleration has been in the last 2 quarters . 
  and we grew more than the what was thought we will . 
   same over here in north tyrol . 
  we 've got loads of south tyrolians coming over to study in innsbruck ( and i mean loads ) . 
  between those you actually have a few italian speakers btw or so i heard . 
   neither of them considers themselves as italian or think south tyrol is italy . 
  but the same logic that applies to you , applies here as well . 
  south tyrol is a complicated place in international studies is often considered a success and maybe considered ulster or basque cauntry it is . 
  but in comparison to aosta valley or fvg or sardinia not really which have similar situation and statutes is not . 
  and coming from another minority trough mom side i can easily make comparisons , just the fact that the province refuse to recognize the existence of mixed children ( even if the eldest have been born in the early 80s more or less ) is a sign . 
  while especially in places like merano o bolzano intermixing is going on in the valleys way less . 
  in part because there is little political will at a local level to change this as there is almost like the idea that if the region becomes less problematic it will lose funds wich if is true is the most idiotic thing i ever heard since those who put into question s.t. 
  special status is becouse progress seem to always happen really slowly there i never heard for instance put into question aosta valley status . 
  that said identifying yourself with your area instead than with the country as hole is an italian classic s.t. 
  are definitely not a special flower in this and by far . 
  things have been slowly improving in the last decades and as the memory of fascism becomes more opaque i believe that huge step forward can be made especially since in the cauntry as a whole there is a growing sensibility to regional lenguages . 
  sorry for the wall of text :(, 
  while those in my university have a decent one that is the place selection i guess . 
  plus there is the factor that even in bolzano there is a solid 30 % of german speakers for an italian speaker is way harder to live isolated in his own community . 
  and also the german test that italians and ladini speakers ( who tend to be good speakers of both ) have to go trough is universally considered way harder than italian one . 
  all italian speakers have to study ( standard ) german and all german speakers have to study italian in south tyrol . 
  the ironic thing is that we call it togliattigrad in italian . 
  that makes sense i guess thanks . 
  someone should go and check if he/she is ok after all that solitude ;(, 
  i wonder if that 0.12 of ladini in glurns is one people like one people who moved away . 
  no but i have sardinian friends like you , 
  the most french is not aosta tho ? 
  well is literally the only place in the region where italian speakers are the majority so technically is not that wrong ... 
  we are all continentali after all , 
  yep we need to find ways to make this kind of issues unimportant uderwise things like south tyrol that have many equivalents around the continent may very well destroy what it has been built . 
  i do n't like how the eu in now but if do n't find a vay to fix it the alternative may be terrible . 
  well in my home town we still have a few sonds from the period in which we where under you that are n't exactly complimentary so i guess is fair xd let 's just hope that the times in which this things where more serious than a meme never come back . 
  so it 's a bit like when we joke to take back fiume when croatia beat us in football ? 
  or more serious than that ? 
  mah they have a lot of befit that under the austrian government i doubt they could ever have . 
  and my university friends from there does n't seem particularly inclined to join you but i realise that people that study in an italian lenguage university may not be the best sample ... 
  scure i heard it here on reddit but your almost-president declarations does n't make it sound like an issue of the past honestly ... 
  well considering that most of the original population ( 11.000 of 44.000 ) was either expelled or left ( see the vespri nizzardi ) and more that 150 years are passed is not surprising at all ... 
  sorry i have seen it said seriously by austrians to many times to actually classify it as a joke first plus humor in written text is harder to catch . 
  colours , shape of the hauses ... 
  actually if you live in south tyrol for getting any work as an employee is mandatory to have at least a b2 of german so please let 's quit this bullshit that german speakers have to learn italian while not the opposite . 
  and the italian test for german speakers is notoriously way easier . 
  here we go again . 
  when the republic of austria has ever controlled south tyrol ? 
  or are you going to claim all the former territories of the empire?i am sure all your neighbours would be thrilled ... 
  you where convinced that german was n't used anymore in south tyrol or italian ? 
  i know that there is this belief that we are still trying to erase south tyrolean culture like in 40s but jesus ... 
  mah i only had problems once with a very old person . 
  i never notice any sign of annoyance in any other case . 
  the only problem is sometimes the level that , like the level of italians speakers living there with german , is sometimes low . 
  you know being more critical does n't mean embrace your opinions necessarily plus as you said the english version has obviously less articles . 
  i will answer to your four rants only once here with a : why do n't you go spit your sense of superiority in the face of someone who actually cares ? 
  just read my other post in this tread . 
  you know how to read right ? 
  just leave him alone . 
  look at his profile discuss using reason with him would not lead you anywhere . 
  and yet you came out with a completely wrong analysis biside by saying it you advocated a competence you clearly do n't have . 
   no backstabbing please !, 
  not this shit again . 
  we have to keep close relationship with the us and russia becouse we had been treated in the ue as everyone shoes carpet for years . 
  we can take one for the team but not all for the team . 
  if other european cauntries keep treating our issues as below those of the doorman we will look elsewhere . 
  becouse frankly we are fed up of taking hits without even a pinch of gratitude from our european relatives . 
  who on the other hand are very good at passing our successes and ideas as their own like the recent migrant deal with libya . 
  and this narrative that we are backstabbing bitches only faithful to money . 
  his not only offensive and false but also ignorant and shortsighted . 
  what we should for you then ? 
  it was our connection with usa that helped us with the recent migrant deal with libya not certain our eu allies that for most of the time either ignored us treating us with disdain or like france simply obstacled us anyway it could . 
  gentiloni is actually going against most of the ue cauntries that would want harsh relations with the us . 
  like he opposed the same for years as a foreign minister with russia . 
  going against all your neighbours to protect your cauntry interest is the opposite of spineless . 
   having lived in italy for a while you are clearly a world renowned expert then / s, 
   i think [ this ] ( http://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/attachments/side_a_rainbow_europe_map_2016_a3_small.pdf ) explains it . 
  that ? 
  lol really lol a rapport that between many errors over the italian situation it says that our constitution ban gay marriage while the ** the italian constitutional curt ruled exactly the opposite years ago ** . 
  base your beliefs over credible suorces !, 
  edit : if buy those parts you mean the south look wich are the only two regions who had a gay governor . 
  for your time sake i will suggest you start looking from the ** deep south ** . 
  edit 2 : family day is really seen as small minority of loud wirdos even by practising catholic . 
  and when there was the family day to oppose gay marriage exactly one week before there was way bigger manifestations in 20 italian city who got 0 attention by the foreign press becouse i guess progressive italians do n't sell . 
  while those fuckers of f.d. 
  had a meeting just in rome and they did n't even menaged to fill the bloody square and you know that your protest failed when even bringing people from all over the cauntry you still ca n't beat the numbers of a tiziano ferro concert . 
  let 's not forget that italy has the third biggest economy of the eurozone and the second biggest manufacturing sector after germany . 
  this narrative that we live of agriculture and turism is becoming annoying . 
  it is from a youtube channel since we do n't have , afaik , a real late show there have been attempts in the past but the format never had much success . 
  thanks for remembering me the beauty of my cauntry,
