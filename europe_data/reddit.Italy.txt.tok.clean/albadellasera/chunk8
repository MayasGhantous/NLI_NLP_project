  and that false news like the vaccines & autism crap is beyond things like the recent meningitis problem . 
  you are quoting a classific that attributes to us the trial over the vatileaks scandal wich belongs to the vatican , right ? 
  go fuck yourself, 
  and yourself recognise the a.e. 
  as your precursor culturally as for instance is evident in cases like just to quote one case the last piece of the new year concert . 
  scure it would be great if one such place existed and we are working with the libyans to obtain that however at the present it does n't and keeping accusing us would not solve anything only create exasperation . 
  we do n't hate you and we like your country . 
  however austria and northern italy have a complicated past . 
  calling someone from the north an austrian can be a bad move if you get the right person . 
   there 's nothing ` decent ' about traficking/trading vulnerable humans and pushing them into death or harm . 
  letting them drown is much better right . 
  becouse this is the alternative dear . 
  unless you think that we are pushing them out of africa lol . 
  law . 
  human decency . 
  absence of real other choices . 
  frankly i 'm tired of the shit we have reciving over migrants always blamed if we did or did n't and you duch have been have been among the worst in this . 
  so please shut up before doing again crap insinuation thanks to an article that is as refined investigation as a bar speech . 
   how misguided to you have to be to hand over investigation to same institution that 's providing safe harbor to this monster ? 
  wait . 
  nobody is handing over anything . 
  the police is having their own investigation and ca n't nor want handing over anything . 
  the scandal in the scandal is that the curch new already and ` forgot ' to tell it as they should have done they are just covering their ass with this story of the internal investigation . 
    it quoted city mayor paolo tonin as saying : ** `` they are also trying to protect him from the clamour of this story that has now gone national . '' ** again the curch is trying to protect him not the state wich was evident in the original sentence wich they have cut to do the usual implication of bigoted italians always ready to protect the curch and mistreat women . 
  shit journalism at his finest . 
  only in very biased articles . 
   step # 1 should be arresting ( and hopefully jailing for a long-long time ) the members of ngos that bring over people from libyan and international waters to italy face a political shit storm . 
  not that i 'm against it but we will compared to putin by day 1 and frankly the condemnation by the european court of justice will will be there pretty soon . 
   step # 2 should be announcing a `` no assistance '' policy towards anyone drowning outside of the southern italian waters ^ sighs ^ exasperated ^ for ^ having ^ to ^ repeat ^ this ^ again it 's . 
  a.crime.and . a.pretty.bad.precedent.in.international.law  step # 3 should involve putting anyone found crossing over the sea border in handcuffs and shipping them over to libya you mean the stateless place where the only thing that keps our people safe and the gas and oil in our pipes is the expensive benevolence of the local tribes . 
  good idea fucking up dawn there even more !, 
  / s president sarcozy is that you ? 
  good year !, 
  hoping that will be more ( ? ), 
  than the one before ? 
  for italian newspapers : la repubblica ( c. left ) il corriere ( central lining ) la stampa ( central right ), 
  so far is great !, 
  since we are in veneto probably a lot of blasphemies . 
  no it goes on since the city origins . 
  when socialist meet noting good comes out nothing good comes out . 
  w. shauble 2016  years he was president : 1994 -- 1995 , 2001 -- 2005 , 2005 -- 2006 and 2008 -- 2011 so more than 5 years ago . 
  nothing justifies redicoulos attacks from the last 5 years . 
  math is not an opinion . 
  besides at least he could claim that he was elected while i could not say the same for the main offender mr-i-don ` t-have-an-high-school-diploma also know as martin shoulz . 
  beheaded in the last few years . 
  now there is some fights between the young generations since the leadership is in prison . 
  apparently, 
  more than 5 years ago ? 
  plus if you cover a public position part of your job requirement is acting in a more diplomatic way that a spinster hausewife . 
  [ found the data ] ( https://www.google.it/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://www.interno.gov.it/sites/default/files/modulistica/xiii_relazione_persone_scomparse.pdf&amp;ved=0ahukewisgudouptrahxjdsakhrcrdcq4chawcdcwaq&amp;usg=afqjcnfgjxlkhnwd3h3u2sgfyilgulzgnw&amp;sig2=j7tvfy1f4pacjv3zrt1_ba ) the region with more disappeared persons is latium , most of people are found in less that a year , only the 1,8 % disappeared for crime related causes . 
  well if it makes you feel better probably if it was an italy map we would probably like ourselves the least . 
  that said stop supporting after and you 'll get a lot of points just for that . 
  we have been doing well on that sector especially thanks the recent boom of solar ( we are second : fear germany we are coming ! ), 
  and makes sense for us to invest a lot on renovables we are too dependent on imports . 
  i suggest you to read [ this ] ( https://www.google.it/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://documenti.camera.it/leg17/dossier/pdf/ap0028.pdf&amp;ved=0ahukewiove7xp5trahveasakhwi_afyqfggamaa&amp;usg=afqjcneihxieujqrklzklzrjhkpa6ty2uw&amp;sig2=gh2w8z-2k_znzoq2plw2pw ) since you 're italian we should really talk more about the things that works in this cauntry . 
  i opened up a tread on the topic . 
  us girls have to be united , 
  if de and fr are compact about something we disagree on we seriously risk the awkward role of the candle . 
  that way we need to stop stomping each other feet and start collaborate with spain . 
  why ? 
  bloking minority vote . 
  imo it 's mostly libia . 
  i ( strongly ) suspect that those points went dawn a lot in the last few years . 
  scure there always been a couple of jokes about you and the family rivalry but they are really small things . 
  glad to know so , 
   next year , as the uk will definitively leave the union , italy 's role is going to be more important and without the trust in the other members , it 's going to be interesting . 
  the problem is that if we do n't get the spanish to play with us we risk to be marginalised wich is my great fear . 
  we really need a strong med axis based on few common shared key points . 
  does really surprise you ? 
  we have no grudges with americans , russian and chinese . 
  while we are pissed with the french over libia ( and we often consider them arrogant ) and as for the germans deep down we never really liked them even well before the crisis and they reciprocated often . 
  this is clearly imo how do you see it ? 
  it used to be 1 of the highest . 
  then libya , the migrant crisis ( for wich we sounded alarms for 10 years at least ) , the sanctions against russia , the economic crisis and a lot of disdain and disrespect from eu top leaders appened . 
  in synthesis : there is no worst fury in hell than a betrayed lover . 
  bad map as usual does n't include the commies of central italy and sardinia is wrong better map [ here ] ( https://i.imgur.com/3xmrztx.png ) . 
  because the cartographer is bulgarian and tought that berlusconi 's villa was the first thing that italians think about sardinia when in reality the real stereotype is something along the line of beautiful island populated by sheep `` lovers '' . 
  if a extremist party in a local election get 10 % while at a national level get 0,1 then maybe in the area should be done a serious reflection . 
  [ as for the ss is an historical fact that recruitment in s.t. 
  happened in huge numbers and beliving that all of them went to south america it 's naive . 
  ] ( https://www.google.it/amp/altoadige.gelocal.it/tempo-libero/2015/10/29/news/sudtirolesi-nelle-ss-ecco-il-libro-verita-1.12354678/amp/ ) and also the main escape route for former nazis passed from s.t. 
  then to down to vatican city and finally get concluded in south america . 
  and it is understandable in a way you ended up between 2 fire in the worst moment of history . 
  what i found sometimes annoying is that some of you tend to act like you were the only minority molested by fascism and you were n't by a long shot . 
  the unified autonomous region as more to do with de gasperi desire to give autonomy to his trentino than to any persecutory intention imo . 
  cruciani and a casa pound moron ? 
  you really know the avarage italian / s btw a ss t-shirt in south tyrol ? 
  how many real ss took refuge in your province after the war and lived peacefully hidden by the local population ? 
  using your same level whataboutism one could interpret it as a signal of integration . 
   `` italianization '' was a mussolini thing , and yes , it involved s.t. 
  but it was a general thing of that lunatic that affected the entire territory . 
  oh yes my mother family is from another linguistic minority and their surname as been italianized as well . 
  it is a bit annoying that south tyroleans get painted of the only poor victims of mussolini `` cultural '' policy they were n't by a long shot . 
  assuming that one such thing as an etnic italian exist wich * spoiler allert * it probably does n't . 
  italian is who has an italian citizenship beside that our cauntry vary so much culturally , liguistically ( yes s.t. 
  are not by far the only linguistic minority and frankly nor they are the more numerous they are just the more famous ) and historically that defining the characteristics that * the italian * should have is impossible . 
  the concept of nation-state is fairly young , for most part builded at art , and has provoked way more harm than good . 
  maybe it 's time to admit that the spirit of the people is and was a dangerous fantasy and move on ? 
  borders in europe are more often than not accidents of history and making everyone happy would provoke the balkanisation of the entire continent . 
  lol if you wanted to insinuate the idea the tyroleans are mistreated for their native lenguage taking out la zanzara was shooting yourself in the foot the only people they have not insulted yet in that program so far is probably some uncontacted tribe in the amazon forest .
