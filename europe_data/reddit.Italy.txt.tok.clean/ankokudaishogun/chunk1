every adult ( 18 + years old ) can vote , in italy . 
  it 's a right . 
  and you need to be 18 + to get a driving license . 
  therefore , every uber driver and possible driver , as well all those fed up with taxi drivers , can vote and they are more than the taxi drivers -, 
  i 'm always surprised how the cellphone services , internet included , are not horribly shit in italy compared to rest of europe and especially compared to the `` modern and advanced '' nations like germany . 
  stop posting and call a taxi , then !, 
  actually uber drivers vote , too . 
  it is a non-news , at least for most people . 
  it does . 
  currently it 's a `` patchwork of bilateral accords '' but they want a `` comprehensive treaty '' . 
  basically , streamline and clean up the agreements . 
  i , too , want to know, 
  even the right in italy is relatively lefty . 
  that said , m5s is fastly becoming fascist ( leader personality cult , inner circle , etc ) , at least at national level . 
  i _ think _ local sections are still relatively independent, 
  a good example is the m5s in italy , which specifically makes a propaganda point of not being left or right . 
  nope , we were the ones taking it to its full conclusion . 
  you guys had to get an immigrate just to copy us . 
  if you want to both break the market and lose the next elections ... 
  actually , the license from the cities are free . 
  but it 's not illegal to trade them among privates . 
  because there is a limited number of licenses around , the private value rises a lot . 
  nope , they did n't lobby for the licenses . 
  they were an idea of the government . 
  taxists just want to keep the licensing status quo . 
  it 's different . 
  ca n't do that : italian taxi licenses are in the free market . 
  ferrero already uses sustainable palm oil . 
  they made a point of it . 
  i would say the `` wages & salaries '' should be the net amount of money the employed gets , while `` other costs '' should cover everything he does n't get but the employer has to pay, 
  i find unlikely the eu would accept a `` transit period '' of fom . 
  surely , not one of just a couple of year . 
  how the hell is italian `` other costs '' so low ? 
  taxes , healthcare , etc weight something like 40 % !, 
  italy does n't really needs a motto ... and we 'd never manage to decide on one , either . 
  great against thieves and kidnappers, 
  it might be a goose, 
  alternatively , it might start with `` durante '' instead of `` con '' , depending on context, 
  italians , french , spaniards ... 
  not really -, 
  basically , we are paying decades of our politicians not doing anything . 
  our pension system should have been reformed at least twenty years earlier , for example . 
  i thought there might have been a problem with the translation of the questions . 
  i did check the question in italian and they are correctly translated , by the way -, 
  vatican city is officially status civitatis vatican\u00e6 . 
  their official language is latin , after all . 
  probably , but that 's the public perception . 
  in the latest years there has been an effort to make a distinction between `` thieves & beggars '' zingari and `` just nomadic '' rom , but the most visible and in contact with the public communities are the `` thieves & beggars '' ones , with the `` normal people '' ones being relatively invisible because , well , they are normal people , if relatively closed to the outside . 
  which results in the over-representation of thieves & beggars overlapping with everything sinti , roma or in general nomadic . 
  even the romanian immigrates got involved , with people occasionally confounding them with the romas . 
  `` black '' is not not an ethnic group . 
  it 's a phenotype . 
  the reason you have to not call yourselves your ethnic is because waaaaaay too many gypsys ruining your reputation . 
  ( or , viceversa : `` normal people '' romas being exceptions so uncommon they are irrelevant to the public perception ), 
  calvinists are quite fundamentalists themselves , but yeah . 
  in italy `` christian '' is interpreted as `` catholic '' unless otherwise specified . 
  which makes sens when 80 % of your population is catholic . 
  i expect similar results in other countries with a one-sided majority of a single denomination . 
  yes , but `` roma '' in italy is synonym with the worst ones . 
  this depends a lot on how the question is asked . 
  basically , a `` roma with a normal legit job '' is not perceived as a roma ( zingaro or rom in italian ) in italy . 
  the rom appellation is applied only to the nomadic people , the worst of them being called zingari ( though this distinction is variably applied depending on the place ) . 
  if you have a `` normal legit job '' you stop being a rom \\ zingaro and become just `` italian '' , `` romanian '' or whatever nationality you have . 
  what is the champion case , and what is the exact question asked in the local language ? 
  maybe it 's a matter of catholic vs orthodox ? 
  or the way the question is asked suggest `` serious practising christian '' ? 
  i 'm not exactly sure about the percentage , but i believe `` white people '' are still the overwhelming majority ( as in +70 % ) of the eu population . 
  `` eire '' is not `` ireland '' in irish ? 
  well , til . 
   the eu would n't accept us , because our deficit would be too high after independence . 
  eu would n't accept you automatically , you would had to pass the same steps as everybody else . 
  not in italy . 
  i 'm unconvinced of bundling together those three . 
  does `` recreation '' includes sports ? 
   he is a very competent politician which is usually quite uncommon in italy . 
  our are mostly chumps , or very competent at anything not minister-ing . 
  but those who are in fact competent are usually hyper-competent . 
  complementary question : why do n't european boys like gender studies ? 
  sadly , all those teenage mothers are a problem we never tried to really resolve . 
  except all trams . 
  they are orange to be seen among the homogeneous grey generated by smog , mist and people using grey paint to hide the dirty of their homes \\ cars better in the fog . 
  depending on the law , it would require the is being acknowledged as an actual state . 
  the last one, 
  given we 're still paying fuel taxes on the war on ethiopia ... 
  [ carrefour di cremona ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xbl3ywd.jpg ) , right today . 
  i blame late hour for having missed when the discussion went from eggs to chickens, 
  iirc pretty much all eu has `` urgent care = free '' , so i think getting on a plane for any eu country and checking at the local hospital might have been the smartest choice . 
  yeah , once in a while you do learn something from the french . 
  pretty much same thing in italy , too . 
  and , if necessary , your doctor can write up a urgent request so you do n't need to wait the normal time for not-urgent specialist visits - if you do n't want to wait , you go to a private specialist and pay up . 
  i think the most expensive rx i 've seen was around 150 $ for a bilateral thorax , just to put things in perspective . 
  also , there are many private specialists who have agreements with the state so one does n't pay the full price . 
  and you get a chronic disorder \\ illness ? 
  your prescribed drugs are free . 
  in italy they send you a doctor when you call sick , to make sure you are actually sick . 
  i wonder if a plane ticket to europe would have costed him less than whatever he thought he would have been paying the usa hospital ... 
  psychos , all of them . 
   recook it after a long while . 
  re-cook eggs ? 
  after a long while ?
