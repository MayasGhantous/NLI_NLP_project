it helped , but you know how offended we can get regarding food and football . 
  * `` hey france , it 's england . 
  do have something to do in the next century ? 
  i was planning a re-match . 
  i 'm not even joking , it 's probably because of football/soccer . 
  we 're still mad for the loss in the final at euro 2000 . 
  edit to myself : wooosh, 
  i 'm curious about how effective this * boar-voting system * is . 
  i hope it 's more effective than the old * humans-only * one that led to disasters . 
  ca n't wait to import it as well !, 
  i 'm always bummed by the people that * do n't * clap when the pilot lands . 
  i could 've died !, 
   no taxes !, 
  governments do n't need them , they print trillions of dollars a day !, 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  yes , and our first single would be `` you 're wrong '' !, 
  i support both the death penalty and the abortion . 
  now we need someone that support neither of them ( it should be easy to find one ) then we can start a band !, 
  we need a cool name though . 
  came here especially for this , thanks . 
   gorilla warfare now i ca n't stop thinking about it . 
  well , i did n't know how to put it in english . 
   carrying a shoulder bag full of books about african culture , ** diokhane ** ibrahima has come to the centre of lecce [ ... ] seriously ?!? 
  for our non-italian brothers : his name in italian is the worst blasphemy against god . 
  the point here is that the title suggests that this issue is causing a turmoil in italy ( read * `` fueling tension '' * ) , when none of the major news is covering this story at all . 
  i just checked those sites and the news is n't even on the front page . 
  you 're right that some media are covering the story but they 're mostly local news ( bari.repubblica ) or school world dedicated news ( corriere/scuola ) . 
  as an italian i 'm totally okay with an islamic university , as long as the courses are in italian or english and that everyone can enroll . 
  in italy we do n't believe that the region of molise actually exists . 
  here 's a fully legitimate [ satellite photo ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/nonciclopedia/images/e/e7/molise.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090127153017 ) . 
  we call this phenomenon * molis n't * . 
  yes i 've been there and it 's just beautiful . 
  the `` city '' is a [ hilltop village ] ( https://www.toscanainside.com/files/images/discover/toscana/borghi/monteriggioni/11.panorama.jpg ) , you can freely go walking over the walls and the view is breathtaking . 
  the city is also one of the stops among the [ via francigena ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/via_francigena ) ( [ map ] ( http://www.ramblingtorome.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/cartinavf-e.101.jpg ) ) , the old pilgrimage road that connects rome with other christians ' holy sites . 
  i 've been there the year after ac2 was released and the locals still had no idea why there 's a sudden increase in the afflux of tourists . 
  but these are the stats that really matters . 
  leave those economic stats to those uncivilized barbarians . 
  yeah , i just did some math and i eat around 90 kg per year . 
  surprisingly , no . 
  which is quite funny since in italy we still call dubrovnik as ragusa ( or * ragusa di dalmazia * ) . 
  according to the wiki the italian ragusa was originally called * hybla heraia * by the romans , but was then renamed * rogos * ( meaning `` barn '' ) by the byzantines . 
  when the muslims conquered sicily they renamed the city in * rakkusa * ( meaning `` famous place where an event took place '' ) . 
  then the normans came and renamed it * ragusia * . 
  meanwhile dubrovnik was originally intended to be named * lau * ( meaning `` the cliff '' , since its inhabitant were called * lausaioi * , meaning `` whose who live on the cliff '' ) . 
  then a series of mistranslations changed the city name in * raugia * , then in * rachusa * , then finally in * ragusa * . 
  from personal experience . 
  while most of the comments are from people living in europe the vast majority of the visitors ( mostly lurkers ) are from america . 
  i 'm just saying this because it 's quite clear to me that op made a lot of research on the places in all of his posts and it would right to expose them to the widest audience possible . 
  anyway the thread is doing fine so it 's possible i 'm just wrong lol . 
  op if you want more visibility i advise you to post in the afternoon when it 's day on the other side of the world as well . 
  that 's better . 
  wait , no jokes on the italians ? 
  i do n't feel welcome !, 
  as always good job op !, 
  though imho it would be cool to alternate between northern and southern regions , just for variety sake . 
  as for veneto one thing you will never hear on the tv or anywhere else is that they are obsessed with the * bestemmie * , meaning direct and mostly heavy insults to god . 
  one would think there are only so many ways to insult something or someone , but it seems that the veneti can craft a new one all the times . 
  they basically use them as conjunction words between two phrases and they do it in the most nonchalantic way possible . 
  a friend on mine once told me that removing the bestemmie from a veneto would deprive them of all their lexicon . 
  and the best is yet to come !, 
  yep , ready to be depressed again in the afternoon . 
  they probably mean in the game `` fifa '' . 
  username checks out . 
  it was the coat of arms of our king before we became a republic . 
  go buddhist for that sweet heir designation and culture points boost . 
  unrelated but are orthodox priests required to have a beard ? 
  it dawned to me that i 've never seen a shaved orthodox priest . 
  wait mexico , do n't think we 've forgiven you after [ the 2010 cultural heritage cook-off ] ( http://i.imgur.com/erquq4s.png ) . 
  you would be surprised by how many active catholic girls are willing to go with `` the alternative '' to not `` commit sin '' . 
  i would watch a reality show following this guy as he travels around the world . 
  ok i probably would n't watch it but i would watch the recap from time to time . 
  [ this article ] ( http://theconversation.com/italys-looming-referendum-is-giving-pm-matteo-renzi-sleepless-nights-63844 ) is quite on point . 
  i blame google for that . 
   we 'll have to see if he still keeps it up after the referendum if he 's still around after the referendum . 
  i 'll probably vote yes ( for the constitutional reform to pass ) but imo renzi will be demolished . 
  there 's too much misinformation going around , it reminds me of the brexit campaign . 
  the funny thing is that i 'm trying to listen to the various `` experts '' about the reasons to vote no , and they 're all saying * `` the reform could be better '' * . 
  no shit , sherlock . 
  of course a costitutional reform that should deprive half of our ~ ~ jurisdictive ~ ~ political system of any meaningful power * needs * some sort of compromise , especially given that the house that will be removed * has * to pass the reform before the referendum . 
  here 's the english subtitled trailer for the curious : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3al1pbx09a, 
  italy make some great comic movies , from the old * `` fantozzi '' * to the superbs * `` aldo , giovanni and giacomo '' * to checco 's movies . 
  * `` tre uomini e una gamba '' * , * `` cos\u00ec \u00e8 la vita '' * and other movies made by aldo , giovanni e giacomo are marsterpieces of the genre . 
  too bad they were never dubbed/translated in english because imo they would translate very well . 
  i saw the movie last winter when it came out , it 's quite understandable all around . 
  i do n't remember most of the jokes so i ca n't say if they would translate well into other languages . 
  i remember i was in switzerland ( the italian side ) when the movie was coming out and there were posters everywhere , the movie was really hyped even if they do n't have the * `` safe jobs '' * culture . 
  the movie is set around 2010 , during mario monti 's technical government aka die hard spending restrictions . 
  italian legends have it that public employes jobs are safe jobs , because it 's really hard to fire them . 
  the spending review proved this myth is not entirely true . 
  the protagonist works as a provincial bureaucrat for the hunt , portraied as excessively useless in the movie , and is excessively worshipped by his family because of his job . 
  the spending review tried to fire him but he clinged to his `` safe job '' and refused any deal . 
  so they sent him around where he was needed , from the north of italy to norway . 
  it 's quite a good movie if they manage to translate the puns and give the main character a decent voice . 
  you have not read the novels have you ? 
  minor spoilers ahead : after being separated from geralt and co. she is teleported on the other side of nilfgaard where she joins a famous band of brigands . 
  they steal from everyone , kill everyone . 
  she starts regularly assuming drugs ( fisstech ) and starts a lesbian relation with another member of the band . 
  this is kinda a philosophical question . 
  what defines a witcher ? 
  the mutations ?
