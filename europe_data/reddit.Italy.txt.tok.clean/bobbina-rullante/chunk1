to be honest i agree . 
  if i recall correctly there were 7 million people in london as recently as 2 or 3 years ago and there 's now over 8 million ? 
  i do n't know how the city is going to be able to cope with that . 
  my plan is to move somewhere north in ~ 5 years anyway . 
  i 'm actually one of those immigrants making it worse . 
  true but i do n't have an umbrella . 
  my shitty one was destroyed by the wind last week and i 'm still waiting for a good one from amazon :d, 
  unfortunately it 's supposed to rain tomorrow :(, 
  thanks for those . 
  so far the only true sanctuary of peace i have found in london is holland park . 
  people even seem to talk as quietly as possible there , it 's great . 
  greenwich park is nice too but there 's usually a bit more people there , still good though and the view is awesome . 
  i will try to visit either richmond park or hampstead heath tomorrow if the weather allows it . 
   so did half of london . 
  seriously , i ca n't even cross the tower bridge anymore on the weekends . 
  what 's a man to do to find some peace in london ? 
  apparently they are, 
  do n't let my polish coworkers hear that, 
  finally some good news . 
  learn javascript . 
  learn angularjs . 
  move to london and make shitloads of money . 
  we all know how * that * is possible, 
  romania and the uk also have better growth rates, 
  you might enjoy the following : / r/europecirclejerk / r/yurop, 
   loud , uncouth and friendly only if you 're from the north ( you think that about romans ), 
  a little late to the party , but this masterpiece just came to my mind : [ peter fox - alles neu ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd0a2plmsva ) - germany, 
  til freestyler is a finnish song, 
  [ rock ode to joy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_gq_avh1wq ), 
  all norwegian airlines flights have wifi . 
  i was skyping during my last flight . 
  pretty awesome, 
   also relatively corrupt free society with a high level of trust between people have made it easy to conduct business . 
  i hate you guys, 
  semi-ot : why are sweden and denmark so rich ? 
  does n't that mean that poor people in the uk are * really * poor if the average is lower than the irish ? 
  wtf is germany . 
  edit : and poor northern ireland, 
  there are [ hundreds ] ( http://londonist.com/the-best-food-and-drink-in-london ) of good to excellent restaurants in london , it 's your fault for eating in pubs or at mcdonald 's . 
  i went to [ this ] ( http://www.amicimiei.co.uk/ ) italian restaurant yesterday with my ( italian ) father and grandfather and they were surprised by how good the food was . 
  there is also [ amazing ] ( http://boroughmarket.org.uk/ ) [ street ] ( http://www.maltby.st/ ) [ food ] ( http://www.greenwichmarketlondon.com/food-and-drink ) [ everywhere ] ( http://www.realfoodfestival.co.uk/market/ ) . 
  there are good sandwich shops all over . 
  there is china town . 
  there is an endless choice of [ breakfast and tea places ] ( http://www.albioncaff.co.uk/ ) . 
  seriously where the fuck did you eat for 3 weeks . 
  i still wonder why the finns kill themselves so much, 
  i do n't think i could bring myself to eat that for a 1000 euros . 
  not saying it 's not delicious , i just could n't do it, 
  well americans probably do n't even know portugal is a country, 
   they were drunk as often as not , vomit everywhere they went , they ca n't stop littering and jumping off balconies so basically , like teenagers from any other country, 
   it 's perfectly possible to live in a densely populated area and be bored but less likely . 
  if you live in [ bod\u00f8 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bod%c3%b8 ) boredom is pretty much guaranteed , imho, 
   there 's no option ok , i agree that 's a problem , but it 's sort of unrelated to the fact that my grandparents need dubbing, 
  my parents and grandparents do n't speak english , they need dubbing . 
  why is that stupid ? 
   out of curiosity , do you see the economic argument for independence in northern italy as any different from that of catalonia ? 
  i 'm failing to grasp what your point is, 
  what the fuck, 
  richest part of spain wants to be independent from the rest of spain . 
  what 's creepy about that ? 
  i do n't know , what does it say ? 
  i 'm saving more money than i could ever save in italy . 
  i worked for a year in italy and i was sharing a flat with 3 other people . 
  here i 'm sharing a flat with 2 people and i 'm saving as much as i was * making * in italy every month . 
  plus i just got a raise and i 'm confident i can get another one pretty soon , while over there i would have had the same salary for years . 
  what should i do ? 
  which probably means you make more than me :d, 
  i know top 20 % is not that high up , but consider what that means . 
  at least 80 % of people in london have absolutely no chance of every buying a house . 
  i 'm among the top 20 % earners in the uk , top 10 % in my age bracket , and i 'll * never * be able to buy a house in london, 
  lol number 75, 
  what does it matter who wrote the article ? 
  yeah , actually austria is one of my favourite countries in the world and i found a company in vienna ~ 1.5 years ago willing to hire non german-speaking people . 
  at the moment i 'm fine in london though , i 'm just at the beginning of my career ( 2 years ) and there are lots of opportunities here . 
  losing my job in vienna would be much more of a problem than here , i think . 
  maybe in a few years i 'll look for something outside of london , probably in austria or switzerland . 
   ( i 've had offers for 500 + gbp ) contracting ? 
  where do you live ? 
  as a developer i really do n't have any other options i think , with not speaking another language and all . 
  well , i 'm fairly confident i could speak it decently after a year or so , hopefully, 
  good to know i have my options open, 
  if only i knew german . . 
   but you certainly pay a lot more for things like rent and transportation compared to the rest of the uk . 
  you also easily make 80k in that industry, 
  i wish everyone would read this so they could shut up forever about it . 
   actually it 's pretty much the same frequency holy shit , you are right . 
  we had 12 governments in the last 20 years , you had 7 . 
  good job !, 
  ok sorry , missed that . 
  my original comment still stands , i still consider it insane that 100k people will be entering a country of less than 10 million people in just one year, 
   i would consider anyone who runs a coward not worthy of my help . 
  what 's boq 's idea ? 
  this ? 
   the entire system of asylum ( and immigration , too ) must be reformed . 
  sounds pretty generic . 
   seriously , how often do french ministers and prime ministers resign ? 
  you 're confusing france with italy, 
  good times . 
  the economy still was n't shit and ferrari was winning formula 1 all the time . 
  i like the melody of your anthem , but the lyrics are a bit ridiculous , sorry :(,
