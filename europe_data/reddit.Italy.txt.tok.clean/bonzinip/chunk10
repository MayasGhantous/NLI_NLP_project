   mega pensions for the rich you have to complain with those who created laws that allow them . 
  i 'm pretty sure that cutting on pensions once you have acquired the right to them would be against the constitution . 
  in fact , cutting on _ future _ mega pensions for the rich is something monti did , by eliminating the computation of pensions based on the average wage from the last 10 years . 
  i agree that everything else you said would be nice , but you do not change the mentality of 60 million people ( with respect to corruption + tax evasion ) in 2 weeks like he had to when he was elected , and finding waste is a monumental job of its own . 
  he 's getting there . 
  i was expecting more , but then i also have hardly ever seen so much being attempted in the last 20 years . 
  the only attempt at reformation that i remember , in fact , is bersani 's reforms in 2006-2007 . 
  it 's possible , but it 's expensive because the current line does n't fit modern train engines well . 
  if you want to go from a to d via b and c , and b-c does n't let you use a high-speed train , you have to go low-speed all the way . 
  you can not switch engines midway . 
  this is just a technical remark , i do n't mean it to be in favor or against the tav . 
    mps could have said `` no '' and then we would have had elections . 
    in your worldview , governments become roman-style imperators - but that is not how a republic with democratic principles work . 
  governments need laws passed to do anything , and laws are passed by the parliament . 
  parliamentary republics work by a delicate balancing of powers between the government and the parliament . 
  parliaments are free to say no , but they need to withstand the consequences . 
    and according to the italian constitution   we both know this was not a stab at the italian government . 
  you can interpret it in many ways . 
  you could take it as a stab at people who call the italian government `` illegitimate '' , for example . 
  first , the government may not be elected by the people , but still it is nominated by those that were elected . 
  mps could have said `` no '' and then we would have had elections . 
  second , monti heads the executive branch and european policy can be executive or legislative matter , on a case by case basis . 
  and according to the italian constitution , even though executive matter has to go through the parliament , he can say `` either this or i go home and you have to fix the mess yourself '' . 
  so all he 's stating is his constitutional prerogatives , basically . 
  i 've no idea if other countries have something similar . 
  italy does not have immunity from prosecution , only from jail and it is subject to confirmation vote from half of the members of the house ( i.e. 
  the default is you go to jail , even though it happens rarely ) . 
  yeah , 50 % +1 vote for stripping immunity is too low , makes it useless and even dangerous . 
  no , but the parliament can vote on keeping them out of jail with 50 % +1 vote from the other members of the house , which i think is the worst of both worlds . 
  either you 're being oppressed , then you deserve immunity , or you do n't , then you deserve jail . 
  i think immunity with 2/3 majority would be better than this . 
  the italian president of the republic is immune , but can be impeached by the parliament for treason and for violating the constitution . 
  berlusconi passed a law that granted him ( and the presidents of the two houses ) freezing of the trial , i.e. 
  effectively immunity , but it was later repealed as inconstitutional . 
  add ukraine too . 
  how often have you heard of accusations of `` corruption '' being used to block political opposition ? 
  it 's not . 
  immunity per se is a good thing ; like all good things it can be used in wrong ways . 
  [ you have a pretty europe-centric view ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_and_anthropogenic_disasters_by_death_toll ) . 
  curious about who 's the 1st . 
  funny , i thought i was for ireland originally . 
  you nailed it . 
  citations please ? 
  have you read mine ? 
  parma : sure , we 'll see . 
  genoa : you do n't need to win to appear on tv interviews and trigger the wrath of your leader . 
  sure ? 
  note i did n't say _ at _ i said _ after _ . 
  parma : [ after a month he still had n't built the city council ] ( http://www.corriere.it/politica/12_giugno_22/giunta-slow-pizzarotti_5fc18f3a-bc2a-11e1-9b58-5a664080906b.shtml ) . 
  [ every other nomination he made was vetoed by grillo or his spin doctor ] ( http://qn.quotidiano.net/primo_piano/2012/05/25/718188-parma_grillo_contro_pizzarotti.shtml ) , [ and they even managed to find legal quibbles so that the mayor would have to obey vetoes ] ( http://www.unita.it/italia/pizzarotti-trova-il-cavillo-br-per-obbedire-al-diktat-di-grillo-1.417223 ) . 
  genoa : after seeing him butchered on tv interviews , [ grillo prohibited tv appearances to every candidate of his ] ( http://www.ilsecoloxix.it/p/speciali/2012/05/11/aphhrxuc-editto_contro_rivolta.shtml ) . 
  before you say `` what about those who were elected in small cities '' , they were just making a `` lista civica '' and using grillo 's name to get votes . 
  and anyway you can not use them to probe what would happen in parliament . 
  what has he _ ever _ said that is _ not _ populist ? 
  ( just like di pietro , fwiw ) . 
  his candidates have been a farce after the last elections . 
  i know , `` we '' referred to the other 50 million voters in my own country . 
  yes , and we did n't vote three times for berlusconi . 
  local bankruptcy is not a good thing , but has nothing to do with state debt . 
   our anthem is a total joke . 
  i sincerely hope you do n't understand the lyrics , they 're so dumb they hurt . 
  why ? 
  they are very hard to understand , and perhaps they sound a bit bombastic now , but they were not a joke in the context where they were written ( i.e. 
  the unification of italy ) . 
  because if you have oil you can afford having higher debt ( you know your gdp is on solid grounds ) . 
  i think you can make the trigger arbitrarily light in some states . 
   if the market 's had just left them alone , instead of trying to bleed them dry , we would n't hear about them at all . 
  i agree , but i think that the eu could have handled that alone ( it did until 2008 , when we were paying record-low interests and going from 120 % to 103 % ) . 
  the stability and growth pact criteria were bullshit , the eu knew it and that 's why they let italy enter the euro . 
  the overall debt ( private + public ) of italy was much better than most other european countries , including some with the best debt/gdp ratios . 
  the problem is that _ now _ rating agencies judge eu countries ( but not the us ) based exclusively on the one parameter that maastricht chose , so italy has to pay very high interests and risks a downward spiral . 
  but it was n't always like this , italy had a < 0.4 % spread in 2008 . 
  0.72 % * 30 years of fertility = 21.1 % , roughly adds up . 
  some politicians in italy try to make it a topic , sometimes even more than the catholic church itself , but they largely fail . 
  well , the money may make it worthwhile to invest the time ... 
  in czech republic it was really easy : get temporary insurance for vin , pay insurance find garage who could check , take the car there , bring the papers and certificate of residence , get taxed  , pay tax , get license plate , get final insurance for plate . 
  the only hard part was getting a certificate of residence , but i needed it anyway for other bureaucracy . 
  insurance may be cheaper in your destination country . 
  there is a reason for this . 
  people actually used to buy the cars abroad for export purposes so they do n't pay vat , get a temporary plate for the car , and then drive them through the borders with the temporary plate ( the illegal part is that they should have declared the car at the border and paid italian vat there ) . 
  because the car did have a plate , they could then import the car and save ~ 20 % of the price . 
  so now italy asks you to pay vat on imported cars if you have had it for less than 6 months or it has less than 6000 km . 
  i guess new regulation could also fix this problem . 
  italy -  czech republic : 150 euros , only a few days needed ( the real bottleneck was getting a certificate of residence , which took 2-3 weeks but is unrelated to car bureaucracy ) . 
  czech republic -  italy : 400 euros , took more or less a month , and it was even more complex than moving to czech republic despite i barely spoke czech and i 'm a native italian . 
  and that was only because the car had been already registered in italy , otherwise it would have cost even more ... 
  same for delaware , btw . 
  but you 're not a journalist , are you ? 
  heh , at least this one [ exists ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicosia,_sicily ) . 
  [ bluvertigo ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0ut9bhy0_s ), 
  funny , i assumed _ you _ were american until the last paragraph . 
  not because what you are saying is false ; however , in europe , in most cases i hear `` communism '' when people mean socialism . 
  i rarely if ever hear `` socialism '' , but when i do i hear it to mean social liberalism or social democracy here , too ( for example in the european socialist party ) . 
  in other words , scotland has been ruling england since elizabeth i died , and scots have n't realized that in 300 years ? 
  italy _ is _ in trouble , but 3-year bond rates got down by 0.8 % since last month , and that happened exactly yesterday . 
  10-year bonds are more or less the same as when monti 's government started , on the other hand they used to be lower than 3-year bonds ( which means deep shit , not just deep trouble ) and now they are n't . 
  since the last downgrade , the pension system was reformed and more proposals will be put forth in ten days . 
  a two-notch downgrade really seems bullshit to me . 
  yes , russia is the only one you mentioned not under the schengen visa , iirc . 
  even switzerland is .
