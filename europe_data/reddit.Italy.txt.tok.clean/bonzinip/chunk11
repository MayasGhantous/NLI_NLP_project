  what university were you at ? 
   agreed re . 
  milan - have been there . 
  was wholly underwhelmed . 
  to appreciate milan you have to go around by car . 
  vigevano , pavia , ticino ( the italian-speaking swiss canton ) , lake como are all great places to visit . 
  i 'm curious anyway as to _ what _ precisely underwhelmed you ? 
  given seemone 's list , rome , barcelona and budapest are a bit out of the path , and st. petersburg is russia so you need a visa . 
  i suggest that you stick to central europe : choose 4-5 from paris , copenhagen , amsterdam , berlin , prague , wien . 
  train can actually be more expensive than airplanes , on the other hand cheap airports are far from the city center . 
  do n't bother about making a circular trip , instead plan ahead and fly back from your final destination . 
  you do n't exist , go away . 
  austria is in the other emisphere , you silly socialist . 
  and sweden is where swiss army knives come from . 
  find somewhere else to eat . 
  as i said , if you were scammed by dishonest businessmen that 's just your fault . 
   do n't take into account the real inflation caused by the prices imaginative `` round up '' , 1 $ = 100pts instead of the official 1 $ = 166.386 pts . 
  the first year of the euro there was a ~ 66 % inflation sorry , this is bullshit . 
  it might have happened for a few very specific things , where prices were `` locked '' below 100pts to market them well ( e.g. 
  a can of coke for 95pts or something like that ) and sold with little or no margin for the owner . 
  but that 's pretty much it . 
  even if some smaller businesses rounded consistently up by 50 cents ( e.g. 
  1000pts became 6.50 instead of 6.0 something ) , 66 % inflation exists only in your dreams . 
  in fact , spain had a pretty easy exchange rates since 6 $ = 1000pts almost exactly . 
  no need to round for example 1 $ = 160pts because the real exchange rate makes math even easier . 
  if you were scammed by dishonest businessmen that 's just your fault . 
   merkel pushed giorgio napolitano to propose monti as italy 's new pm . 
  that 's the urban legend i was referred to . 
  that germany must be happy with monti is obvious , but correlation does not imply causation . 
  both draghi and monti had been climbing popularity rankings for 1-2 years before monti was appointed , and italian politicians had been proposing monti as pm for all that time . 
  napolitano also had shown ( as much as he could while remaining _ super partes _ as mandated by his role ) that he did n't dislike the idea . 
  you can read [ here ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/03/world/europe/president-giorgio-napolitano-italys-quiet-power-broker.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all ) about why napolitano 's moves are not surprising at all . 
  protip : brits are rarely unbiased sources when it comes to the eu . 
   merkel 's direct influence in italy 's and greece 's government replacements at least for italy , that 's an urban legend . 
  italy had been looking for a way to replace berlusconi for almost 2 years . 
  not all of them , but we have indeed a high ratio of incompetent mps . 
  ah , fine , i did n't know it 's an americanism . 
  you 're right that `` mp '' would have been just as precise and better english ... anyway , the article is a pretty bad translation from italian , and it shows in several other points . 
  it 's talking about the two chambers which compose the legislative branch in italy . 
  lower prices is _ not _ a happy direction . 
  not necessarily , at least . 
  read about deflation . 
  what is not clear about the word `` volatile '' ? 
  do you think it makes any sense that prices went down by 18 % in two years between 2007 and 2009 in the uk ? 
  you may say that 's `` not getting poorer '' , but such a deflation ( which of course exists only in that table ) would be a nightmare . 
  and do you think it makes any sense that prices went up by 13 % in the last two years in the us ? 
  that would also be a pretty high inflation , not matching my definition of `` not getting poorer '' , yet i never saw any headline about that anywhere . 
  so , i 'm not in denial about prices going up in many countries of the eurozone . 
  i 'm denying that you can make sensible comparison between euro and non-euro countries ( or even just about non-euro countries ) based on those data . 
  and i 'm denying that increasing prices since 2002 imply the cause are the euro coins and notes . 
  i 'll note that you 're conveniently excluding for example finland and ireland , whose prices went down ; denmark , whose prices went up despite being outside the eurozone ; slovakia , whose prices went up _ until _ it joined the eurozone in 2009 . 
  i 'm not talking about `` up '' or `` down '' . 
  i 'm talking about volatility . 
  results for non-euro countries are simply too volatile to make any sense . 
  all i 'm saying is that the numbers are so volatile for non-euro countries that they are meaningless . 
  there are two hypotheses : * euro suddenly makes prices more stable . 
  no reason for this to be true . 
  also , us and uk are in the middle of a 15 % or more deflation ( and had +15 % inflation in the early 2000 's ) and have n't realized that . 
  sounds unlikely . 
  * data for non-euro countries is affected by other factors such as currency exchange ratios . 
  of this , only the second is likely . 
  right , corrected . 
  when = 10 years ago , what = gbp/usd . 
  yes , some prices were increased very badly . 
  in italy restaurants did . 
  food also increased badly at popular destinations for tourism , often at 1 euro = 1000 lire ( instead of 1936,27 ) . 
  everything else stayed within government-reported inflation , in my experience . 
  one interesting observation , and one of the few things that berlusconi ever said and i agree with , is the following . 
  in the first few years after the introduction of the euro , people tended to compare euro prices with lira prices , but they did so with a ratio of 1 euro = 2000 lire . 
  this introduces an extra `` perceived '' inflation of 3 % , and ( together with the few cases in which business owners acted dishonestly and `` rounded '' prices up ) gave a bad name to the euro . 
  another observation is that previously prices were `` rounded '' to 50 lire , 100 lire , 500 lire , or 1000 lire ( depending on the kind of good and kind of business ) ; now they are usually rounded to 5 cents , 10 cents , 50 cents , 1 euro respectively . 
  this is almost twice the amount and so it is more noticeable . 
  however , it also means that increases happen more rarely . 
  highway prices for example are computed to the euro-cent , but then what you actually pay is rounded to the closest 10 cents . 
  if you are paying 1.80 for 1.76 , it may well be that next year you 'll still be paying 1.80 instead of 1.82 . 
   as the euro retreats from its current overvalued levels , courtesy of mr draghi 's interest rate cute . 
  are you serious ? 
  the euro used to be ~ 1.5 times stronger . 
  that 's the only reason why the uk and us prices went down . 
  _ edit _ : when/what , as pointed out correctly . 
  * usd vs. eur was 0.9 on jan 1 2002 , 1.4 on jan 1 2012 . 
  * gbp vs. eur was 0.6 on jan 1 2002 , 0.83 on jan 1 2012 . 
  that the euro is no longer overvalued , and the usd/gbp are no longer undervalued is the reason why the euro 's purchasing power went down , and the usd/gbp purchasing power went up . 
  notice how the us/uk price oscillations are very consistent with the currency ratios ( e.g. 
  usd vs. eur was 1.25 on jan 1 1997 , plummeted up to 2002 , and then went up again ) . 
  the same effect can be observed on switzerland ( huge increase in the last two years , when the franc went from 1.5-1 .6 chf for a euro up to 1.2 chf for a euro ) . 
  if the delta was real , uk and us would be in an awful recession and would have nothing to cheer about ... tl ; dr : eurostat data is rubbish for non-eurozone countries if you do not take into account the wild oscillations in currency exhange ratios . 
  youth employment is not good even in the north , though far from the 30-40 % of the south . 
   low taxes , expensive health insurance . 
  go figure well , that 's pretty much the norm . 
  it 's either like that or `` high taxes , health insurance included '' . 
  in some places the panel\u00e1ky have even been renovated and are n't even that ugly ( [ these ones ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/brno_lesn%c3%a1_-_panorama_s%c3%addli%c5%a1t%c4%9b.jpg/1280px-brno_lesn%c3%a1_-_panorama_s%c3%addli%c5%a1t%c4%9b.jpg ) are in brno ) . 
  there are definitely uglier neighborhoods than those ... ( lived in \u010cr for ~ 1.5 years ), 
  [ they count health expenditure basically ] ( http://www.prosperity.com/health.aspx ) , since all other indices are not very different in 1st world countries . 
  and bad spending is the second big problem with us healthcare , together with access to facilities . 
  us # 1 for health ? 
  you must be kidding . 
   a two-tier europe is likely , with the eurozone countries becoming ever closer , either within or outside the eu itself . 
  but many non-euro countries actually wanted to join the euro before 2011 , they just did n't because they could n't afford it anymore due to recession . 
  the truly skeptic countries are ( besides uk ) only sweden , denmark , hungary and czech republic .
