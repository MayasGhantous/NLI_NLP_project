  certainly most of the left-wing voters very much see a government with grillo as a lesser evil compared to one with berlusconi . 
  the unknown-unreliable compared to the known-unreliable . 
   italians realise that they are being propped up by other countries are they ? 
  if we have absolutely zero problems renewing our debt , it 's because investors actually believe that the risk connected to our debt is in practice lower than what the interest rates say . 
  i 'm all for fixing things , but understand that other countries are benefitting just as much from our awful state of things . 
   so , apart from the last 20 years , you have tried hard ? 
  we absolutely have n't , before the last 20 years . 
  the reason why the euro is a good thing for italy , is because we can not anymore believe that we can go from one devaluation to the next . 
  but berlusconi was not prime minister for all of the last 20 years and [ we did improve the debt/gbp rate from 1996 to 2001 and from 2006 to 2008 ] ( http://www.cnb.cz/miranda2/export/sites/www.cnb.cz/en/monetary_policy/inflation_reports/2011/2011_iii/boxes_and_annexes/zoi_iii_2011_box_iii_gr_1_a.gif ) . 
  when berlusconi was at the opposition . 
   so , they did n't buy the bonds that the article said they bought ? 
  the article said the ecb said they _ could _ buy bonds . 
  no one ever bought any italian bonds to save our asses . 
   italy ca n't put its head in the sand anymore , which sounds like you want to do . 
  no , i just want to put things straight . 
    italy has never participated into any of the stability mechanisms . 
    you are supposed to i mean esm and efsf . 
  we never requested help . 
  ( participated was indeed not the best choice of words ) . 
   for example , you should n't have a debt of more than 60 % of gdp . 
  yes , and except during berlusconi 's governments we tried hard to reduce our debt/gdp ratio . 
  italy has agreed to have no deficit in 2013 ( way below maastricht 's 3 % ) . 
  also , it has a very large public debt but a very small private debt . 
   and yes , are you not aware of the fact that the ecb has gone out and defended the italian interest rate ? 
  never with money . 
  just promising to do that was enough to put speculation to rest . 
   who do you think guarantee that people will eventually get their money ? 
  the italian tax payers ? 
  or , other countries tax payers ? 
  even the _ need _ for this is just speculation . 
  so far , italy has paid for greece 's debt even though italian banks had virtually no greek debt , unlike for example german banks . 
  italy has always been , and still is , a net payer to the eu . 
  besides , it is even possible that buying italian bonds will pay itself off , unless italy defaults , because buying bonds will raise their price . 
  promised low taxes . 
   mafia is really the true power there not really true , but it can buy the poorest people ( and the south is poorer ) , which in turn helps electing corrupted politicians . 
   the only reason the italian interest rate is n't going through the roof is that the ecb _ could _ buy italian bonds . 
  italy has never participated into any of the stability mechanisms . 
  it 's not really about the media . 
  it 's simply that some people will vote for anyone who is not in the left . 
  this was the function of the christian democracy until 1994 , now it 's done by berlusconi 's party . 
  it 's the 10-15 % of the population that can swing the elections one direction or the other . 
  the same thing does n't really happen on the left . 
  the most biased electors there may choose to abstain , for example , or to vote for more radical parties ( to some extent you can count grillo among them ) . 
  we can talk about the fries . 
  also mussels and quick . 
  no problem , bbc makes the same mistake . 
  fwiw , it 's not illegal wiretapping . 
  it 's leaking and publishing of a legal wiretap . 
  no , and the statute of limitations is kicking in next september . 
   it is no secret that their current and former leader were communists and if they say anything else it is a lie . 
  i do n't see any problem with _ having been _ a communist . 
  having seen your ideals fail ( and quite spectacularly ) teaches you a pretty harsh lesson . 
  it forces you to understand what was the good thing that brought you to communism and re-elaborate that one value in a completely different way . 
  also , having been _ this _ tied to the soviet union ( there was even a town in russia named togliatti ) makes it easier to see the changes that happened and analyze how they came about . 
   i thought we were speaking about pci . 
  the successor had a hammer and sickle and just dropped the name of communist because socialist is a lot more moderate . 
  yes , we did . 
  `` they '' in `` they participated in the international '' is the pci , sorry for the confusion . 
  to sum up , the communist party was a real communist party , and initially ( at least until the invasion of hungary , as you pointed out ) the official line was that of moscow . 
  later on , however , it was not following moscow blindly -- while remaining _ the _ communist party , and as such getting funding from moscow . 
  the party that bersani grew in had already started rescinding links with moscow ( which took ~ 15 years , plus 15 more until the sickle and hammer disappeared ) . 
  no successor of the pci ever called itself `` socialist '' . 
  they are part of the european socialist party , but that 's it . 
   does n't fvg generally vote right wing parties ? 
  yes , but that 's mostly because many die-hard fascists were sent to `` colonize '' istria and then kicked back into friuli after the war . 
  because they were not socialist , there was an italian socialist party and it died of corruption in the 90s . 
  they participated in the international , and were more and more often against moscow starting in 1969 . 
  but yes , it 's very well known that pci got funding from moscow . 
  everybody else got funding from washington , and also help putting bombs just before elections if a victory of the pci was possible ( portella della ginestra , piazza fontana , bologna ) . 
  what would you expect with the strongest communist party of the western world , and bordering a socialist ( though non-warsaw-pact ) country such as yugoslavia ? 
  socialist parties were typically anti-soviet . 
  communist parties were not , especially those that participated in the international . 
   of course they have to advertise themselves so more people would vote for them ( especially because of the communist terror ) , this is what all communist parties in europe have done . 
  you 're confusing _ socialist _ parties with _ communist _ parties . 
   the point i 'm making is that their name shows that they are taking distance from the left past so why should one not vote them because of their pci past ? 
  in fact , after the renaming of pci to pds ( democratic left party ) in 1991 , a minority faction split into a party that kept the `` communist '' name . 
  it started with ~ 8 % of the votes . 
  it has now removed the reference to communism in the name , and is now around 3 % . 
   also as far as i have understood the current president giorgio napolitano initially defended the soviet invasion of hungary . 
  and he said he regretted that , and was [ among the first ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meliorism_%28politics%29 ) to move the pci towards european socialism . 
  also , that 's almost 60 years ago . 
  the party was unanymous in opposing the invasion of czechoslowakia . 
   `` the democratic party '' does a very bad job at describing its political ideology and its political stance . 
  they are part of the european socialist party and agree with that party on most stances . 
   i have a hard time buying that . 
  imagine if alleanza nazionale would use the eagle and claim they were not fascists but conservatives . 
  alleanza nazionale did n't keep the eagle because the fascist party is illegal in italy . 
  no party with the eagle existed in italy after ww2 . 
  but alleanza nazionale used the fire which was the logo of the msi ( post-ww2 fascist-in-all-but-the-name party ) . 
  compare [ this ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=movimento+sociale+italiano+-+destra+nazionale&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=bsn&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:unofficial&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=gqgxuzlrb-le4qsqpybg&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=584 ) and [ this ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=alleanza+nazionale&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=km2&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:unofficial&amp;channel=fflb&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=_acxuylhosivswadiocwbw&amp;ved=0ceuqsaq&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=584 ) . 
  no , because the left is disappointing them . 
  except that bersani 's party includes the former catholic leftists , and did more reforms and is arguably more liberal than the center-right . 
  the current party does not have anything to do with communism . 
  in fact , it had moved away from the soviet union since 1969 ( when bersani was 18 ) , and in the 70s they strongly opposed the communist terrorists we had in italy ( brigate rosse ) and soviet invasion of afghanistan . 
  the current president of the republic comes from that party too . 
  the italian communist party was dissolved around 1991 . 
  the sickle and hammer remained in the logo to `` help '' voters of the former pci find the new one . 
  my choice is ringhio gattuso . 
  sorry that was indeed unclear . 
  they vote together , and the votes are summed .
