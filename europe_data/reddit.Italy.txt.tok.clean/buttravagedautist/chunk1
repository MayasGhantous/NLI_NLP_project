the moderator team really hates russia , that much is certain . 
  and you can push the boogeyman narrative for the price of a joke . 
  brilliantly done . 
  what a joke . 
  do n't tell me : you wear a helmet when you ride your bike . 
  any justification for your prognostic ? 
  you know what you have to do uk : [ vote leave ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxsqaxx_ao0 ) , ok ? 
  the perfunctory , shoehorned denigration was a mix between cringe worthy and hilarious : `` these people are peacefully demonstrating !, 
  can you believe that ? 
  so * sinister * . '', 
  yes , yes . 
  i must read the whole surah . 
  and if i do that , you then demand that no , the hadith commentary is also necessary . 
  sooner or later , i must have a phd . 
  in islamic theology , otherwise whatever passage i quote does n't count for shit . 
  you 're not the first apologist i get to talk to , so i 'm jaded enough to simply not care to try to convince you . 
  just know that millions of your own fellow muslims disagree with you . 
  you think they 're wrong ? 
  argue with them instead : i 'm not the one who 's fostering a community that condones blowing non-believing people up . 
  you 're clutching at straws . 
  i can recommend you something that 's a whole lot better : peer reviewed scientific articles . 
  * the ( in ) compatibility of diversity and sense of community * [ pdf ] ( https://www.msu.edu/~zpneal/publications/neal-diversitysoc.pdf ) from the abstract :  community psychologists are interested in creating contexts that promote both respect for diversity and sense of community . 
  however , recent theoretical and empirical work has uncovered a community-diversity dialectic wherein the contextual conditions that foster respect for diversity often run in opposition to those that foster sense of community . 
  more specifically , within neighborhoods , residential integration provides opportunities for intergroup contact that are necessary to promote respect for diversity but may prevent the formation of dense interpersonal networks that are necessary to promote sense of community . 
  * ethnic diversity and social trust : evidence from the micro-context * [ pdf ] ( http://politicalscience.ku.dk/staff/academic_staff/?pure=files%2f130251172%2fdinesen_s_nderskov_ethnic_diversity_and_social_trust_forthcoming_asr.pdf ) excerpt from the abstract :  in this paper we argue that residential exposure to ethnic diversity reduces social trust . 
  [ ... ] the results show that ethnic diversity in the micro-context affects trust negatively , while the effect vanishes in larger contextual units . 
  this supports the conjecture that interethnic exposure underlies the negative relationship between ethnic diversity in residential contexts and social trust . 
   i read the holy quaran two or more times every year and i ca n't find anything about harming innocent creatures you are a liar . 
  surah 2 , from verse 191 : `` and slay them wherever ye find them , and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out , for persecution is worse than slaughter . 
  and fight not with them at the inviolable place of worship until they first attack you there , but if they attack you ( there ) then slay them . 
  ** such is the reward of disbelievers . 
  there is still a lot of censorship here . 
  the mod team just does it in a much more prompt and smarter way now . 
  another sociopath who dreams of controlling everything and offers flimsy , transparent excuses for it . 
  sorry to break it to you , but not all opinions are equally valid , buddy . 
  wasting money is the government 's favourite pastime . 
  `` wasting '' money on high traffic websites like reddit , in particular , is very useful to the managerial elite . 
  ever read [ chomsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manufacturing_consent ) ? 
  it seems like there is a consensus on reddit that the russian government , for example , pays people to push a favourable view of its policy on reddit . 
  i have very little doubt that it does . 
  why would other governments abstain from such a practice ? 
  because they told you they wont ? 
  dream on . 
  so you believe that too many black children are being born . 
  how is that not racist ? 
  because `` everyone '' will tell me the same thing ? 
  well , yeah , the world is full of racists , so they would probably say that , would n't they ? 
  [ whipping people and flipping tables ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cleansing_of_the_temple ) is within the realm of possibilities . 
  do you believe that there are too many black children being born or not ? 
  no , only brain-dead racists will tell you that . 
  ah , so you 're one of those maniacs who advocate for the extinction of the human race to [ `` save '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w33hrc1a6c ) the planet . 
  totally next level . 
  so the less [ african children ] ( http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/world-fertility-rate-map.png ) are born , the better ? 
  what are you , some sort of subtle racist ? 
  sure , but anti-natalism is a fringe opinion . 
  there are a whole lot more people who would want to have children but can not ( due to various problems that range from infertility to their economical status ) than people who downright would not want to have children . 
  it 's not that at all . 
  those old farts are simply the most numerous cohort , which gives them the political clout to suck the life out of everyone else . 
  we have the same problem here . 
  excellent . 
  our plan for world domination continues apace , one glass at a time !, 
  and yet you condone ethnic cleansing . 
  those countries are usually ruled by tyrants who care about their own skin and fortune above everything else in the world though . 
  same thing , they can be `` persuaded '' . 
  it 's not morally impossible either . 
  obviously not . 
  look , i am familiar with this tactic , with trying to paint anyone who takes notice of your shilling business as a tinfoil-hat wearing lunatic , so try something else . 
  yes , i already caught on that you 're one of those people who think that only intentions , not results , matter . 
  sayings like `` the road to hell is paved with good intentions '' were made exactly for people like you . 
  good day . 
  no , unlike you , i am not a shill . 
  i know i 'm wasting my time responding to a shill ( do you get paid to post , btw ? ), 
  but there was no brutal crack down on protests , just retaliation against an attempted false flag from saudi led insurgents ( the middle east is dirty business indeed ) which was billed as a crack-down by certain news outlets in the west ( including here , in italy ) because it was convenient to the u.s. department of state . 
  the leaked hillary clinton emails confirm this . 
  also , what does the past of the family have to do with anything ? 
  ever heard of `` white flight '' ? 
  if you think there is such a think as a repercussion free , peaceful mass resettlement of different peoples , then you are historically illiterate . 
  that you do not think it is `` scary '' , does not actually make it any less so . 
  it 's only a testament to your own ignorance , and nothing else . 
  protest ! = civil war , mr. shill . 
  by signing an alliance treaty , how else . 
  that does not mean that the treaty will also be , in fact , enforced . 
  history is littered with examples of this , hence the above distinction being relevant . 
  do you have any more questions with obvious answers ? 
  is the independent unique somehow in that regard ? 
  same question to you : why do you condone [ ethnic cleansing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_cleansing ) ? 
   if latvia suddenly became majority german would that be so bad ? 
  why do you condone ethnic cleansing ? 
   the main reason the civil war started was because assad is a brutal dictator . 
  yeah right . 
  and i am napoleon bonaparte . 
  welcome to the club . 
  you need to learn the difference between `` de jure '' and `` de facto '' . 
  the latter is a lot more relevant . 
  there is not a single non-biased mass-media outlet . 
  not one . 
  every news corporation is owned by one special interests group or another . 
  that the mass-media is neutral is one of the biggest myths in existence . 
  but it is politically correct to notice this bias in some cases , and politically incorrect to notice it in others . 
  you 're either a troll or an ignorant buffoon .
