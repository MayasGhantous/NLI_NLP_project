  on the contrary , we are one of the most self deprecating , most prone to auto-commiseration countries in europe [ 1 ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2013/05/what-europeans-think-each-other ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2012/05/29/chapter-4-views-of-eu-countries-and-leaders/ ) , [ 3 ] ( https://i.imgur.com/sebiqjk.png ), 
  prove you wrong about what ? 
  do i have to remind you that your country back in the 70s and the 80s was crippled by unemployment , high inflation and economic decline ? 
  you , in a couple of decades , passed from the richest nation in europe to the fourth richest , after germany , france and italy . 
  then we experienced stagnation and still are , while you started to grow faster and faster and , as some analysts say , you 're actually in your way to return to the first position . 
  what i want to say with this is that `` what comes around goes around '' . 
  maybe today we are a `` struggling '' country like greece or portugal ( not true ) but that does n't mean that we can have a comeback like you did . 
  so do n't act so superior you deluded twat , 'cause you are n't . 
   and ( as a german/austrian ) i fully support your views . 
  i do n't know , for me it 's kind of a deluded way of thinking that sometimes keeps us from improving . 
  still it 's flattering to see your own efforts praised by someone else , so thanks mate . 
  exactly that . 
  you hit the point , mate . 
  reading my previous post i realised that i was n't clear enough about the fact that italians , even unconsciously , think that italy belongs to the same tier of france , the uk and exceptionally germany . 
  of course i know that in europe people have a very different perception of my country and its economy . 
   it 's an english expression , i thought that you being on an english language website would understand it . 
  it 's not hard to understand your expression , rather what you wanted to communicate by it , but since you came out of the blue with that , without even putting it into some sort of context , i did n't know how to interpret it . 
   your arrogance and sense of entitlement are staggering . 
  in this very sentence you showed yours , good job . 
  anyhow , i wo n't even bother trying to confute your statement since , as we say in italy : `` by washing a donkey 's head you only waste time , water and soap '' . 
  try to figure out what that expression means . 
  what does that even mean ? 
   italy is not in any higher league , only in your mind . 
  can you read ? 
  i was n't saying that for me spain belongs to an inferior league , but that in italy that 's the general thought . 
  [ here you are btw ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:ita:fra:esp&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_kd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ita:fra:esp:deu:gbr&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ), 
  i know . 
  we are to you ( and to france ) what spain is to us . 
   italy 's gdp per capita has always been closer to the spanish than to the french or german . 
  that 's not true , as other users have pointed out before me . 
   you have no clue how a central bank works or what it 's supposed to do . 
  vabb\u00e9 se lo dici tu ...  you ca n't do it because you do n't have a central bank that makes 100 % sure that your debt is safe . 
  yet german debt is considered safe while ours is n't . 
  if it were as you said then why is there a different perception between our debt and germany 's debt ? 
   why did you completly ignored my point about the safety of public debt ? 
  better to ignore it instead of talking about such a touchy subject , i see  . 
  it 's indeed safer if it 's state owned but it still represents a burden that most of the times becomes unsustainable . 
  look at japan , for almost two decades they have seen a stagnant economy with an increase of the already high public debt . 
  today they still have to deal with this enormous debt that has n't ceased to grow and that has inhibited its governments space of maneuver . 
   once again , your tangent about corruption and mafia is completely pointless . 
  it has always been there , we ca n't solve it if we do n't have money , we ca n't make the situation better if we ca n't invest in ourselves thanks to stupid eu rules . 
  better cut police budget though ... again , the very fact that they have always been there is self explanatory of the current situation . 
  corruption , concussion , extortions , money laundering are way more problematic to our economy than the eu or the lira/euro change would have ever been . 
   what other countries are you talking about ? 
  i see countries that get helped by the ecb and countries that do n't . 
  guess who are the one having it the worst now ? 
  france , germany , the netherlands and even spain have higher foreign investments in gdp percentage than italy has . 
   in fact , i have mad respect for all the people who engineered such a cool scam . 
  best scam of the 21st century up until now if you ask me . 
  when you have and already high public debt and a stagnant economy it 's not only obvious but rather lapalissian that you can not fully respond to an economic crisis , like the one that hit us in 2009 , by increasing the spendings and stimulating the economy , as we should have were n't the debt to enormously high . 
  again , you can blame prodi as much as you want , it does n't change the fact that craxi and berlusconi destroyed our capabilities of dealing with this crisis . 
  corruption is not exclusive of italy , yet it costs us 60 billion euros , more than in germany , france , the uk and spain . 
  organised crime is not exclusive of italy , yet with money laundering alone mafias make up 10 % of our gdp with 118 billion euros affecting tremendously the development capabilities of southern italy . 
  even if the divide has always been there does n't mean that it has a lesser impact on our current situation . 
  the same it 's true for the work market . 
  why do other countries not suffer of our chronical lack of investments if they have no sovereignty , too then ? 
  yes he did , wheter you aknowledge that or not . 
  of course it was merkel 's fault . 
  do n't forget those damn commies . 
  they are always to blame too ... 
  you have to consider though that italy used to compete with france and uk in the early 90s , ( actually we [ surpassed the uk in 1987 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/il_sorpasso_ ( economics ) ) ) while spain was still far behind . 
  nowadays it 's still automatic to think of italy as a country in the same league of that of france , uk or even germany , even if we have been left behind for two decades now , while considering spain to belong to an inferior league . 
  yeah , as if the beginning of the italian economic decline ca n't be attributed to craxi 's governments ( huge increase of public debt ) and then to berlusconi 's rise to power , whose governments were all characterised by low gdp growth if not plain stagnation . 
  our economic problems , in the late 80s as much as today , are the effect of : corruption , mafias , north-south disparity , rigid work market , lack of investments . 
  you can blame prodi as much as you want , but at least he tried to reduce the public debt . 
  about the euro , have a read of this [ article about the 1936.27 lira/euro change ] ( http://www.linkiesta.it/it/blog-post/2011/11/24/il-cambio-lira-euro-sbagliato-a-chi-dice-una-panzana-simile-raccontate/3022/ ) . 
  not exactly . 
  nowadays many old southerner ladies wear [ this sort of veil ] ( http://sicilyweb.com/foto/dilisidugo/18.jpg ) , especially if in widowhood . 
   while southern italy was a feudalist unified kingdom far from the core of europe . 
  i 'm sorry but that 's not entirely correct . 
  it 's true that northern and c. italy were amongst the richest regions of europe , both economically and culturally , but southern italy was not that far behind , especially sicily . 
  as a matter of fact , during the arab occupation , the island was the most developed territory of western europe after al andalus and it maintained its prominence in europe until 1282 with the sicilian vespers . 
  southern italy was so developed in the middle ages that its kings were for two centuries , specifically from the xii to the xiv century , the richest in europe and for that reason the most important families of that time ( hauteville , hohenstaufen , anjou and valois , trast\u00e1mara ) fought each other for its control . 
  the real turnaround was the expulsion of the jewish population in 1492 , which meant the collapse of the economy due to the destruction of the bank system ( both in spain and in s.i. 
  ) , at the time ran by jews . 
  so , if anything , the south began to lose its economic momentum in the early stages of modern history and not in the middle ages as it 's commonly believed . 
  in substance though , the outcome remains the same : the south is significantly less developed than northern italy socially , economically and even culturally . 
  a real shame and a waste of an enormous potential for its own development and for that of the entire country . 
  nevah !, 
  to gain something you have to lose something . 
  soon the swiss cows will march in rome !, 
   step 2 : surrender \u0ca0_\u0ca0 italy shall never surrender ^ she ^ might ^ switch ^ side ^ though, 
  well fuck me if this is not a diplomatic insult casus belli !, 
  come on renzi improve our prestige by declaring war on those cheese makers and get a shitload of money from 'em . 
  with our mighty army nothing can go wrong , i 'm sure of it . 
  watch this [ prank video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmkqma-rhvy ) from naples and scroll down the comments . 
  most italians found it easier to understand the english subtitles than the dialect used in the video . 
  actually i 'm from abruzzo ( born and bred ) and as far as i can tell everybody here eats fish on christmas eve . 
  we do n't have the `` feast of seven fishes '' anymore but we still stick with the catholic tradition of avoiding meat . 
  i thought it was common throughout italy , even in the north . 
  since now i 'm curious , can you tell me what do you eat on * vigilia di natale * ? 
  according to italian newspaper la stampa , during the same period of time , european economy has seen a 46 % growth , crisis included . 
  that 's how we do !, 
  how are roads , car and drivers aspects of ones culture ? 
  what does it even mean ? 
  it means that i respect the cultural legacy of the catholic faith even though i do n't believe in god . 
  for instance i 'm all for the progressive secularisation of italian society , but at the same time i 'd like for us to preserve a lot of aspects of our religiosity that have been with us for centuries , if not millennia , and that contributed to define the italian culture itself . 
  i 'm thinking for example about `` festa dei serpari '' of cocullo , which is a religious celebration that has its origins in the cult of the italic goddess angitia ( 26-27 centuries ago ) , but i can also think about via crucis or about italian superstitions , nativity traditions and so on . 
  i 'm a culturally catholic atheist . 
   furthermore , there are countries like italy , which 's south has a unique and not european culture what ?
