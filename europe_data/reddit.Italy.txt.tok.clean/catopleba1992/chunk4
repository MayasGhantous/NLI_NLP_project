  i 've nothing against naples and palermo , it 's just that they 're amongst the poorest cities in italy , while turin was one of the richest not too long ago . 
  turin worse than palermo and barely better than naples ?!, 
  that 's a real shocker !, 
  i knew it was hit hard by the crisis , but i never would have imagined it to be in such a bad shape . 
  i do n't know what to expect , actually . 
  i think milan 's score would be more similar to that of bologna rather than that of turin , but i 'm not entirely sure . 
  on one hand you have turin , which is for sure cheaper ( both in rents and cost of living ) and greener than the lombard capital ( although milan does have quite a few green areas ) but on the other hand milan offers more job opportunities , it 's better run , its public transportation works better and the city is overall cleaner than turin . 
  our constitution explicitly says that `` italy is one and indivisible '' so it 's literally impossible for sicily to secede and become independent . 
  besides , there is n't really a push for independence in sicily like there is for example in sardinia , where people really wish for their island to become an independent country in a distant future . 
  thank you !, 
  just curious , how similar are turkish and azerbaijani ? 
  e dissociati . 
  ribadisco . 
  just banter . 
  i 'm actually rather fond of france and french people . 
  of course i speak for myself . 
  you 're free to write your own opinion on this matter . 
  he was such an incompetent twat . 
  we perceive you to be a more successful version of ourselves ( even if we do n't like to admit it ) , being france more influent , richer and , overall , more functional than italy . 
  then we compete with you in : cuisine , wines , art and so on , which for sure does n't help . 
  it 's not hatred . 
  we consider you to be our biggest rivals because we both stand out in the same fields of expertise : cuisine , wines , art , music , fashion , architecture and so on . 
  other than that it 's just banter . 
  what a tool he was !, 
  yes , i ca n't think of any instances where we booed their anthem . 
  other than in football we do n't really have a rivalry with germany , while we do with france ( even if it 's one sided ) . 
  absolutely . 
  because france and germany are italy 's biggest rivals . 
  we 're especially not fond of those damn frenchies . 
   since red hair has no genetic roots in the italy of yore , i would speculate that it was a common way to denominate barbarians . 
  hardly so , after all there were even roman names which meant `` red haired '' , like * fulvius * or * rufus * . 
  in italy surnames started being used around the xi century , well after the barbaric invasions had taken place . 
  these surnames were usually : patronymics ( de crescenzo , d'antonio etc. 
  ) , related to one 's profession ( ferrari , fabbri etc. 
  ) , related to one 's place of origin ( lombardo , veronesi etc. 
  ) , related to one 's physical appearence ( rossi , bruni etc. 
  i would say that abruzzo it 's undeservedly overlooked : you have [ costa dei trabocchi ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=pescasseroli&amp;hl=it&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewic7edrlk3oahvcnrqkhzbzajkq_auibygc#hl=it&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=costa+dei+trabocchi ) , [ punta aderci ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=pescasseroli&amp;hl=it&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewic7edrlk3oahvcnrqkhzbzajkq_auibygc#hl=it&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=punta+aderci ) , [ gran sasso ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=gran+sasso&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjomlh4mk3oahwe7xqkhf_2bdkq_auibygc ) and [ majella ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=majella&amp;hl=it&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjx7regma3oahwkqbqkhyxrcoeq_auibygc ) all within a 70 kilometers radius . 
  abruzzo is also the region with the highest percentage of protected territory of the whole europe , hosting three of the most important national parks of the country . 
  specifically i think that the [ abruzzo national park ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parco_nazionale_d%27abruzzo,_lazio_e_molise ) is well worth a visit . 
  it 's the second oldest national park of the country , but it 's probably the most important one thanks to its pivotal role in the preservation of many endangered species . 
  it hosts in fact the largest population of brown bears of the country , being the only place where the [ marsican brown bear ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=orso+bruno+marsicano&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewih0mnnkk3oahug8rqkhvy1cuqq_auibigb ) never went extinct ; it also hosts the [ apennine chamois ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=orso+bruno+marsicano&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewih0mnnkk3oahug8rqkhvy1cuqq_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=camoscio+d%27abruzzo ) , which , just like the marsican bear , survived only within the borders of this park ; then it sheltered some of the last packs of italian wolves helping them grow again and expand throughout the whole peninsula ; finally it hosts roe deers , red deers , boars and many more species . 
  in its boundaries there are also many hidden jems , like the [ barrea lake ] ( http://www.abruzzocitta.it/foto/lagobarrea11g.jpg ) , the [ camosciara ] ( http://www.parcoabruzzo.it/fotogallery/923_4_pnalm.jpeg ) , the little villages of [ scanno ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=la+camosciara&amp;hl=it&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewitzktrk63oahxbvhqkhxuyclaq_auibygc#hl=it&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=scanno ) and [ pescasseroli ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=pescasseroli&amp;hl=it&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewic7edrlk3oahvcnrqkhzbzajkq_auibygc ) and many more things . 
  edit : wrong link, 
  kingdom of the two sicilies for the win !, 
  i 'm gon na eat a croissant , now . 
  yes it can be problematic . 
  it helps , though , that most of the times those very elderlies live within the area they were born in , so they are somewhat able to communicate in broken italian in most public offices . 
  as far as my grandparents are concerned , my parents take care of every bureaucratic stuff . 
  were n't my parents ( and my aunts and uncles ) around , my grandparents would probably be lost . 
  well , it is possible * per se * to teach them as a faculative subject , but the only times they actually tried to do so , like in sicily or in lombardy , people started to complain because public money were being wasted into dialects that children could learn at home . 
  the problem is that , at home , most of those children are not exposed to dialect since it `` worsens one 's italian '' , thus they neither start to learn it at school nor at home . 
  as far as i know they are only teaching `` dialect '' in friuli since a ) their language is recognised by the state and b ) they are a `` regione a statuto speciale '' ( in other words they have means and benefits that other regions do n't have ) . 
  not even in sardinia they are implementing a full scale teaching of sardinian !, 
  the attitude towards dialects has definitely changed over the course of the past thirty - twenty years . 
  people are now starting to appreciate the value of these languages more and more , probably because they 're dying and they are going to be replaced by italian . 
  as far as i know there are n't any serious attempts to revive the dialects though , because , after all , except for sardinian and friulian they are not recognised by the state and so they ca n't be taught in school nor used in public offices . 
  still , the common misconception that speaking dialect it 's just for ignorants and peasants is sadly quite widespread whithin the country , among all generations . 
  [ this is a video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7se4lkifqpm ) from my home region , abruzzo . 
  if you were to read the comments , the most common ones would be : `` was anybody able to understand at least a word in this video ? 
  '' , `` what language are they speaking ? 
  '' , `` i did n't understand jack shit '' , and so on . 
  now , it 's true that the fact that they are old makes it more difficult to fully understand what they say , but it also shows just how different the various dialects can be . 
  those two elderlies probably can only speak abruzzese ( like my grandparents ) and probably they only have a passive knowledge of italian . 
  we , younger generations , are their exact opposite . 
   do you think regional dialects are more respected/liked there than in places like piedmont ? 
  you have to consider that veneto , sicily , sardinia and the south in general were until recently regions of emigration , while piedmont , lombardy and emilia-romagna were - and still are - regions of immigration . 
  this has helped the dialects of the former regions to hold and resist the advance of italian because there was no need for a `` lingua franca '' among their inhabitants . 
  the same can not be said for piedmont ( or lombardy or emilia for that matter ) : when the immigrants from southern italy arrived in those regions , they were forced to use italian in order to be understood by the locals and viceversa . 
  as the years went by the languages of piedmont ( piedmontese but also occitan , lombard , ligurian ) were gradually replaced by italian in almost every situation , formal or informal . 
  today only in rural villages people can * actually * speak piedmontese . 
  on the other hand in veneto the dialect was preserved and it 's still widely used , even in public offices ( not in school though ) . 
  the same holds true for southern italy . 
  then , as you already speculated , the regional identity in veneto is way stronger than the piedmontese one and that surely helped them to preserve their language . 
   they are basically all languages from the same subfamilies which make them almost mutually intelligible with one another . 
  i 'm sorry but that 's absolutely not true . 
  in italy the romance languages are divided into : ** gallo-italic ** group ( lombard , piedmontese , emilian , romagnol , ligurian and arguably venetian ) and ** rhaeto-romance ** group ( ladin and friulan ) which belong to the subfamilies of western romance languages along with french , spanish and so on ; ** italo-romance ** group ( italian , central italian , neapolitan , sicilian ) which belongs to the subfamily of italo-dalmatian languages along with romanian ; ** southern ** group with just sardinian . 
  languages within the same group are somewhat intellegible , but languages which belong to different groups are as intellegible as any other two romance languages . 
  sardinian is no more similar to italian than french is , furthermore it is arguably more akin to spanish than to italian . 
  edit : i misspelt rhaeto-romance, 
  i do n't speak german , so i 've no idea what this article is talking about , but when in doubt [ fuck germany ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tys9jqeoe9y ) ^ since ^ yesterday ^ i ^ hate ^ you ^ all, 
  still awful , though . 
  btw you deserved to win , good luck against iceland ( fuck you france ) ^ and ^ fuck ^ you ^ too ^ germany, 
  that would have been terrible indeed , but hey whatcha gon na do ?!, 
  with germany though , fuck me , it was fantastic to be their nightmare , their nemesis . 
  fuck they 'd never beaten us in a tournament and now this !, 
  i would have much preferred to lose against spain . 
  the finns drink milk with dinner ... 
   it is absolutely better than anything we had in the past exactly . 
  just think about the fact that we were , not only able to prevent any conflicts between our countries , but also to make them collaborate with each other and eventually to become friends !, 
  look at france and germany , they fought for almost a millenium ( i 'm also considering the hre ) yet now they 're the best of friends , unimaginable just 70 years ago ; or look at hungary and romania collaborate and work together despite centuries of hatred ; and the list goes on and on . 
  and we 're all richer than we were before , too !, 
  founding members for the win !, 
  absolutely . 
  the eu is more than a mere economic organisation , it is ( or it should be ) a big family of nations which share the same cultural background , the same history but especially the same values . 
  we should n't dismiss what we 've accomplished thus far nor we should create barriers among us . 
  i knew we could count on our little sister albania < 3, 
   and who the hell wants to join an italian block ? 
   france will play bad cop germany will play good cop . 
  guess we 'll be the cop who brings the coffee, 
  heh , it 's hard to say as it mostly depends on one 's own political affiliation .
