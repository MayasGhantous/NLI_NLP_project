   he 's like the most hated italian prime minister ever . 
  by no means i am a renzi 's supporter but come on that 's simply untrue . 
  craxi , berlusconi , andreotti and even monti are far more despised than he is by a great margin . 
  yes but they are only the means through which people can feed their need of extremism not the source itself . 
  the source is generally social and economical marginalisation , political instability and poverty , as the bruxelles 's and paris 's attacks showed us . 
  of course books that are pervaded by racial or religious hatred should , when possible , be ostracised and kept out of public reach but banning them does n't solve anything . 
  if i 'm driven by low instincts , whether i follow the jihadist cause or the racist cause or the nazi cause , i might still end up doing something terrible according to the cause i chose to follow . 
  we should address the situations which cause extremisms , not the means ( racial theories , islamist books ) which give them a form . 
  absolutely . 
  modern readers must be provided with a well editorialised edition of the book to fully understand its content and to put it into perspective . 
  i do n't know this particular edition of the book , though , so i ca n't comment about the way the subject was dealt with . 
  i know that you were n't talking about the quran , i was just doing a * reductio ad absurdum * . 
  i 'm refuting your statement that jihadist literature creates terrorists or that `` mein kampf '' creates nazis out of nowhere . 
  if i am inclined to believe in certain ideologies , whether i get access to first hand sources or not does n't change anything . 
  those who are prone to be manipulated will be manipulated no matter what , or at least that 's what i think . 
  as i said :  if someone wants to absorb jihadists ' absurd ramblings and make them his own , a ban wo n't prevent it from happening . 
  reading the quran wo n't make you a terrorist , just like reading the bible does n't make you a crusader . 
  only simple minds can be plagiarised just by reading some `` controversial '' materials . 
  if they want to be manipulated into becoming terrorists ( or nazis ) , no ban can prevent them from doing so . 
   it 's about the newspaper which is giving it away as an extra where is the problem in that ? 
  in the very article you posted it 's explained the newspaper point of view :  the daily is publishing volumes exploring third reich history and defended its decision in its saturday edition by arguing that reading `` mein kampf '' is the `` true antidote to the toxins of national socialism . '', 
  and i must say , even though il giornale is a shitty newspaper , i can not but agree with them in this particular circumstance . 
  everyone should read `` mein kampf '' in order to understand hitler and thus nazism , since they both played a pivotal role in world history , even if that means giving the book away for free . 
  i much prefer for children in school to study the aberration of hitler 's ideas from the source itself because this way anyone can see by himself , with no filter , just how skewed was his vision of the world . 
  i ca n't see the problem here . 
  we should n't demonise nor ban a book just because it was written by a controversial figure . 
  i 've personally read `` mein kampf '' ( or at least i tried to , but i did n't succeed in finishing it ) yet i was n't a nazi before reading it nor i 've become a nazi after . 
  if someone wants to absorb hitler 's absurd ramblings and make them his own , a ban wo n't prevent it from happening . 
  i know that this question of yours may only be a rethorical one , nonetheless i want to give you a brief explanation that possibly might make people understand italians ' choice to vote for this clown of a president . 
  first we have to analyse the conditions in which the political berlusconi was born and the events that got him elected in the first place in 1994 . 
  the early '90s in italy were a very problematic period to say the least . 
  in 1992 the `` tangentopoli '' scandal bursted out , which involved all the major parties of the country : the democratic christians , the socialists ( which at the time were in the government ) , the communists , the liberal party and which revolved around a huge system of corruption , bribery and concussion . 
  this scandal was of such a magnitude that the political scene of the country basically collapsed : the dc , the s.p. , the c.p. , the l.p. could n't survive the public outrage and by 1994 they had all ceased to exist . 
  it was the end of the first republic and the beginning of the second republic . 
  contemporary to tangentopoli there was the so called period of the * stragi di mafia * ( mafia massacres ) . 
  on the 30th of january 1992 in fact , during the so called maxiprocesso , the supreme court sentenced definitively cosa nostra 's bosses and affiliates ( captured or * in absentia * ) to a total of 2665 years of imprisonment . 
  this sentence , of course unacceptable for tot\u00f2 riina ( cosa nostra boss of the bosses ) , brought to a long list of homicides , whose victims were : complicit politicians , the very magistrates who made the maxiprocesso possible ( falcone and borsellino ) and even regular folks whose guilt was to be in the wrong place at the wrong time ( mafiosos used to put bombs near churches and public squares ) , leaving the entire country in shock and despair for the faith of sicily and of italy itself . 
  finally the late 80s and the early 90s coincided with the start of italian economic decline , which resulted in an economic recession and a raise of public debt from the 80 % in1984 to 120 % in 1994 . 
  the state and the parties had proven to be incapable yet again . 
  in all of this berlusconi thrived : successfully he took advantage of the situation and by promising to reform the politics , to deal with the mafia and to improve our economic output and by using his media empire , he won italians ' approval adn assured for himself the pm 's office . 
  obviously he did nothing of what he had promised and even when the first trials started to be launched against him , his swarm of * aficionados * kept voting and supporting him , because again he had the means ( his tv stations ) to convince them of his innocence . 
  the rest is sadly history . 
  yep !, 
  she was clearly trying to read it , [ she must have forgotten how to do it properly ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouubuohtrf4 ), 
  barely . 
  i 'll keep an eye on you . . 
  filthy barbarians !, 
  be careful , those of you who 'll answer affirmatively to this question will end up on italy 's enemies list . 
  yeah , what the hell is suecia ? 
  and what about alemania , is it like some sort of beer-induced mania ?

  they ca n't for sure . 
  still , ours was a fair attempt to educate the ignorant masses who live beyond the sacred borders of abruzzo .

  hei we can also win food war , you silly greek !, 
  like russian , but with words that i 'm able to understand . 
  honestly i ca n't spot any differences between the rhythm of romanian and that of any of the slavic languages . 
  thank you . 
  that was very informative !, 
   you should check out the undertones if you like the derry accent . 
  thank you , i most certainly will . 
  i find the derry accent to be the most characteristic of all ( even though the uvular `` r '' around south kilkenny was interesting too ) , particularly the way they pronounce some words , like they do with * car * `` kjar '' or * out * `` oyt '' .

   m\u00e9lanchon is a communist and of a party always in opposition . 
  hamon a centre left of a party that has had the responsibility of governing . 
  it would be hard to find a common positioning . 
  eh , i guess it would . 
  i thought that , eventually , they would have been able to find a common ground to make an alliance . 
   macron is not part of the left at all . 
  he is centrist . 
  i know . 
  he seems to be the kind of politician who could be considered a liberal ( american definition ) in the us and a centrist in europe . 
  that 's the reason why i called him a `` liberal \u00e0 l'americaine '' . 
  thank you . 
  was n't there a talk of a possible hamon-m\u00e9lenchon alliance a few days back ? 
  would the left not prefer one of the two over macron , which seems to be more of a liberal * \u00e0 l'americaine * ? 
  it 's highly unlikely that le pen will be able to win in the second round of the elections . 
  of course one can never know but , according to recent polls , in the second round macron should lead le pen by 22 points , while fillon should do the same by 17 points . 
  btw , clinton won the popular vote and the polls were not that far off from the actual results of the elections . 
  sicily , lombardy , liguria , piedmont , emilia-romagna , tuscany , campania all have separatist movements yet none of these regions is shown on the map . 
  thank you , good sir , for making me spill tea on my laptop . 
  jean-marie 's fn and marine 's fn are two very different beasts . 
  while marine 's fn certainly qualifies as a populist far-right movement , it has also abandoned the demi-fascist and anti-semitic positions it used to have under jean-marie 's leadership . 
  in other words , deeming it necessary to become president , marine has decided to normalise the party and bring it to more `` mainstream '' positions common to many right wing parties , euro-skepticism and anti-islamism being the most apparent , while at the same time rejecting the extremist stances which used to be ingrained in the fn rhetorics under her father 's leadership . 
  so , comparing the 2002 election results with the probable outcome of this election is not entirely fair , in my opinion . 
  well the country itself did n't exist as an independent entity until the second half of the 19th century , so by your logic we should also consider anyone born before 1861 to be a `` foreigner '' . 
  fact is , a common culture spanning from the alps to sicily existed since the time of the communes ( if not before ) , this even though the peninsula was not united under one government until much later . 
  corsica , in particular , was very influenced by tuscan culture and language and its people were more similar to those living on the mainland than sardinians are even today !, 
  napoleon 's childhood hero , pasquale paoli , had this to say :  we are corsicans by birth and sentiment , but first of all we feel italian by language , origins , customs , traditions ; and italians are all brothers and united in the face of history and in the face of god . 
  this to show that they themselves felt italian even though a country called italy did not exist . 
  this kind of comments never gets tiresome . . 
  kim jong-un , obviously . 
  nor should be forgotten the price paid by belarus , which lost 25 % of its whole population , or ukraine ( 16 % ) , or latvia , armenia and lithuania ( 13 % each ) etc etc. 
  that of the soviet republics was a common effort . 
  consider that at the beginning of the war , the soviets had more warplanes , more men and more armoured vehicles than germany by a large margin . 
  had stalin not dismissed his generals ' concerns about an imminent german invasion , then it 's very possible that the soviet death toll would have been significantly smaller .
