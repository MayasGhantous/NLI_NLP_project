  sadly , though , the unreadiness of the soviet high command and stalin 's stubbornness and foolishness paved the way for in the destruction of the 50 % of their air forces and the annihilation of most of the mechanised regiments of the western districts in just four days . 
  i did not think about gypsies , actually . 
  conflating romanians with rromani might be the only possible reason which could explain that answer , 'cause otherwise it 's just plain stupid . 
  romanians work their asses off like few other people in italy . 
  they 're a very hard working bunch . 
  so not too different from abruzzo . 
  we even have our own stone face to worship , the [ sleeping beauty ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=gran+sasso+bella+addormentata&amp;hl=it&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewjvpe-c3plsahurk8akhq3maisq_auibigb#imgrc=kxo8i859plr-um: ) ( aka gran sasso ) . 
  least hardworking romania ?!, 
  wtf, 
  so , how is new hampshire ? 
  i do n't see how what has happened in greece is applicable to italy and italians . 
  as i said , we had various reforms which had already raised the pension age to 60/65 in 1992 . 
  i 'm not questioning whether it was right or wrong for the dutch people to protest over these reforms , i 'm questioning your claims about italians protesting over an increase of the pensionable age from 54 to 60 , which is something that has never happened . 
  true that . 
   adding this to free health care and free college and the much more wholesome school lunches they also noted , an an american , i was super impressed . 
  college in italy is not free . 
  public universities ' fees depend on income and can be as low as 0 $ per year ( if you 're in the lowest bracket ) and as high as 2000/2500 $ per year . 
  private universities are obviously more costly , with fees as high as 10000 $ per year . 
  as for school lunches , people with lower incomes have their lunch costs totally or partially covered by the state . 
   to then see a news report about greek or ** italian riots ** where the protestors carry banners that call brussels a dictatorship and that makes them slaves . 
  the reason ? 
  because their pension age was raised from like 54 ( !!!!! ), 
  when was that ? 
  in italy the pension age was raised to 60 for women and 65 for men in ** 1992 ** !, 
  before 2004 one could retire at 58 with 37 years of contributions ; then , that year , we had the maroni reform which raised the age to 60 . 
  then in 2011 it was raised again to 65 !, 
  where the hell did you take the 54 figure from ? 
  so it 's a challenge !, 
  nah , that 'd be a very short-sighted decision in my opinion . 
  i 'd rather go to some small islands in the mediterranean sea . 
  cres ( croatia ) or skyros ( greece ) would be ideal for the purpose : they 're large enough to provide arable land and pastures for the livestock , they 're scarcely populated ( around three thousand people each ) which means there 'd be few zombies to deal with and , finally , they can not be reached without ships or boats . 
  once you 're there you can live your life unscathed . 
  ps mont saint michel is amazing . 
  he does n't even need to wear a peruke !, 
  wow that 's crazy !, 
  in turin the base price is 310 $ . 
  students pay 175 $ while elderly people over 65 pay 140 - 155 -217 $ depending on their incomes . 
  no , we use the capital letter only with proper nouns such as * roma * , * italia * , * paesi bassi * . 
  adjectives and adjectival nouns such as * romano * , * italiano * , * olandese * are written in lowercase . 
   vassal of a vassal in other words , a * vavasour * . 
  at least we europeans should use the correct terminology for the brightest period of our history . 
  all hail the emperor !, 
   is the 8000 dialects true ? 
  they 're considering each * comune * ( municipality ) to have its own distinct dialect , so in a sense it 's true . 
  however , neighbouring communes can also have very similar if not identical dialects ( this is especially true near bigger towns or cities ) so the number might be significantly smaller . 
   how much of those are at least somewhat understandable to e.g. 
  someone from rome ? 
  dialects from latium and tuscany are the most understandable for someone from rome ( and for other italians ) ; then follow the dialects of the central regions of umbria and marche . 
  dialects from other regions are not easily understandable for a monolingual italian , this without previous exposure . 
  probably , for a roman , neapolitan ( south ) is easier to understand than bolognese ( north ) , being the former more similar to central dialects than the latter , still the extent to which said roman would understand neapolitan is generally low , meaning that he would only understand the general gist of the discourse . 
  basically it 'd be like hearing someone speak spanish or brazilian portuguese . 
  * lenguages * , * loosers * . 
  oh , come on guys ... 
  thank you !, 
  thank you !, 
  sweet . 
  so , i guess only the constitutional court will be able to repeal the decree , right ? 
  can he refuse to sign the bill ( or has he already signed it ) ? 
  i do n't know if in romania it works the same as in italy , but here the president can veto a bill if he deems it unconstitutional , in which case the parliament is compelled to discuss and modify it . 
  can this still happen ? 
  every president ought to seek the best for his country and the people he represents , but that should not come at the expenses of other countries nor it should come through the use of strength . 
  if what trump wanted to achieve were just having fairer deals for the us and better relationships with his allies , then i would n't have anything against that , but using this tone and imposing his diktats on others is not the right way to do it . 
   i think the message is mostly directed at america 's frenemies . 
  places like pakistan , saudi araba , and egypt that get lots of assistance from the us while undermining american interests . 
  are we sure , though ? 
  are we sure it does n't extend to those allies who do n't align to the american foreign policy ? 
  for example , recently at his meeting with the cia , when speaking about iraq , he 's said : `` we should 've kept the oil . 
  but maybe we 'll have another chance . '', 
  what if america wanted to pass a resolution which allowed a new intervention in iraq and some european countries were to vote nay ? 
  would they also be included in the list of bad countries ? 
   `` our goal with the administration is to show value at the u.n. and ** the way that we 'll show value is to show our strength ** , show our voice , have the backs of our allies and make sure that our allies have our back as well . '', 
  good posturing there . 
   `` for those that do n't have our back , we 're taking names , we will make points to respond to that accordingly . '', 
  nice to see allies resorting to threats and intimidations in order to get what they want . 
  does trump really expect us to bow down and obey like chinese eunuchs at the emperor 's court ? 
   as for the others , their life , so far as they knew , was as it had always been . 
  they were generally hungry , they slept on straw , they drank from the pool , they laboured in the fields ; in winter they were troubled by the cold , and in summer by the flies . 
  sometimes the older ones among them racked their dim memories and tried to determine whether in the early days of the rebellion , when jones 's expulsion was still recent , things had been better or worse than now . 
  they could not remember . 
  there was nothing with which they could compare their present lives : they had nothing to go upon except squealer 's lists of figures , which invariably demonstrated that everything was getting better and better . 
  the animals found the problem insoluble ; in any case , they had little time for speculating on such things now . 
  only old benjamin professed to remember every detail of his long life and to know that things never had been , nor ever could be much better or much worse -- hunger , hardship , and disappointment being , so he said , the unalterable law of life . 
   and yet the animals never gave up hope . 
  more , they never lost , even for an instant , their sense of honour and privilege in being members of animal farm . 
  they were still the only farm in the whole county -- in all england ! -- owned and operated by animals . 
  not one of them , not even the youngest , not even the newcomers who had been brought from farms ten or twenty miles away , ever ceased to marvel at that . 
  ehm , austria-hungary , germany and italy formed the triple * alliance * ( hence the collective name of * allies * ) . 
  france , russia and the uk formed the triple * entente * . 
  we joined the entente not the alliance in ww1 . 
   if you would have joined us then ww1 would had been won easy . 
  italy was not self-sufficient neither in raw materials nor in food supplies . 
  besides it was impossible for italy to invade france from the western alps and to significantly alleviate the pressure on the western front . 
   hitler would be only a sergeant and no ww2 and no anti-semite shit . 
  impossible to say . 
   naval warfare changed a lot back then . 
  royal navy or not a unified continent with german lead tech would have easily defeated both usa and russia . 
  yet both ah and germany were blockaded and lost the war due to low supplies and food shortages among both the army and the civil population . 
  italy would have been affected aswell . 
  the entente on the other hand could rely on a stronger navy and immense supplies coming from their colonies as well as from foreign commercial partners ( america , argentina ) , which were instead not able to refurnish the allies due to the forementioned blockade . 
   usa wanted no wars after their bloody civil war .
