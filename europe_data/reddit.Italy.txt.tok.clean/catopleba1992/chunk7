  germany should have avoided sinking ships in the atlantic and suggesting mexico to declare war on america , then . 
  it 's buffoon . 
  [ this is buffon ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=buffon&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiws-74pn7rahvhcpokhbkwcvqq_auibygc ), 
   italy would have had more of a short-term rather than long-term impact . 
  exactly . 
  not only italy was hugely dependant on british coal , but it was also not agriculturally self-sufficient and had to import huge amounts of wheat and other cereals from abroad . 
  were italy entering the war alongside the allies , it would have surely experienced a blockade early on in the conflict , since the * regia marina * was no match for the royal navy and this would have caused a supplies shortage for the men fighting at the front as well as a deficiency of raw materials essential for the war industry . 
  all in all , i do n't think italy joining the allies would have changed the course of the war significantly . 
  he was indeed . 
  it 's also worth noting that the austrian chief of staff , conrad von h\u00f6tzendorf , advocated a preventive attack against italy in 1908 , when the cities of messina and reggio calabria had been struck by a destructive earthquake and then again in 1911 while italy was at war with the ottoman empire . 
  both his pleas were rejected by the emperor . 
  that 's the po valley , the most densely populated area of the country . 
  it only covers the 12,5 % of italy 's territory , yet 15 million people ( 25 % of the country 's population ) live there . 
  plus it 's an agricultural powerhouse so there is little room left for trees and forests . 
  yeah , that too . 
  a lot of them are `` low quality '' forests . 
  land abandonment and urbanisation have had the effect of causing a great expansion of the forested land with the downside of having an extremely high density of trees per square meter , which increases the risk of fires and the spread of tree diseases . 
  on top of that , high tree densities are detrimental for biodiversity of plants and animals , since the fastest growing tree species tend to expand at the expenses of the other species : the underbush is particularly affected by this . 
  matteo salvini , leader of the northern league . 
  guess they are . 
  same with antwerp for belgium . 
  at the same time , though , 65 % of americans think that the right to bear arms exists so that they can protect themselves from their own government . 
  in italian most of the times we do n't trill our * r * s ; instead , we pronounce them like the * t * s in `` butter '' ( american pronunciation ) . 
  so , if you 're american ( or an english native speaker of any sort ) , most of the times you should n't have problem dealing with the italian `` r '' . 
  for instance , in `` trono '' ( throne ) and `` drone '' ( drone ) , the * r * is an alveolar flap , not a trill . 
  we do make a trill when we have words ending with an * r * ( `` amar '' , to love ) or words with double * r * s , ( `` carro '' , chariot ) , but even then you can simply pronounce it like a flap ( you would n't sound native , but it would be less cacophonic than an english rhotic `` r '' ) . 
  in spanish they trill their `` r `` s much more than us , but even then you can work on your alveolar flap . 
  the problem is not berlusconi , but rather brunetta , gasparri , santanch\u00e8 , romani who do n't seem to like him that much . 
  in order for parisi to take the lead in forza italia , there must be a repulisti within the party which should not end with berlusconi 's departure but should also include his inner circle ( the clique of above ) . 
  i think he 's doomed to fail either way . 
  starting a political movement on his own will be a real challenge ( he does n't have tv stations and he does n't use populist rethorics , so he 'll probably have scarce appeal to the masses and the medias ) and becoming the leader of fi will be as challenging . 
   if i had to name parisi as something , i would call him liberal . 
  yeah , you 're probably right . 
  liberal , for parisi , is the most suited term . 
   he 's the only decent politician left within the center right . 
  i thoroughly agree with you . 
  he seems a rather decent fella and i honestly do n't know why he decided to align with berlusconi a while ago . 
  i really hope he 'll be able to create a new political platform for moderates , away from silvio 's influence and hostile to salvini . 
  i doubt he will be able to achieve such a goal , though . 
  it was in october , on * porta a porta * . 
   boschi had a debate against salvini i decided to avoid that like the plague . 
  since the outcome of this referendum is tightly linked with the fate of the current government , most of debates on tv and public discussions have n't been exceptionally informative or impartial . 
  public discussions ( in the likes of university assemblies ) in particular have been extremely biased and with an extremely partial point of view . 
  the tv debates i 've watched have been reasonably informative and reasonably focused on the ups/downs of the reform ( personal opinion ) , but many were just awful . 
  the ones i watched were renzi ( our pm ) - zagrebelsky ( the ex president of the constitutional court ) and boschi ( the minister who `` wrote '' the reform ) - parisi ( a conservative politician ) . 
  m5s and lega nord have opted for fearmongering and shitshows . 
  ahahahahahaa right . 
  and with that comment you 've just proven that you 're too . 
  cheers !, 
  yes , 15000 euros per migrant is nothing worthy of note ... 
  nor is worthy of note the political backlash that such a policy would 've caused in the international community and among our european partners . 
  it `` got ruined '' by americans , not by the left . 
  liberal in europe refers to centrists like macron . 
  only in the us the term liberal is used when speaking about the left . 
  why is greece green when the word shown on the map is * \u03b1\u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 * ? 
  it does happen mostly in the south , but op implied that it had happened only because it was the south , which is bullshit . 
  well , a ten point drop in popularity in one month is a rather big `` achievement '' , but i think you 're right . 
  it 's almost physiological to lose support as time goes by after an election . 
  we should wait and see how things will be a year or so from now . 
  come at me bro, 
  they offered us tea at the grand baazar even though we had not bought anything , which was very cool , and in a few other shops , but we generally bought it . 
  i was on holiday so i could n't make it myself , but there were plenty of \u00e7ay vendors on the streets selling cups of tea . 
  no wonder you drink so much tea , \u00e7ay is the shit . 
  when i visited istanbul i bought an average of four cups of tea per day . 
  if i could buy \u00e7ay here , i 'd drink it all day . 
  your coffee was awful , though . 
  ahaha thank you . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/economia/2016/10/10/news/economia_immigrati_pil-149285846/#tabella%20confronto ) . 
  if you can not read italian i can translate the most important passages of the article . 
  lots and lots of moroccans , tunisians , albanians arrived by boat , which * is * illegal and i 'm not condoning that at all . 
  i 'm simply disproving the notion that foreigners do n't contribute to our economy , which is complete bollocks . 
  unfortunately i 've got no data to show how many moroccans or tunisians , who 've arrived here illegally , were able to stay here and contribute to our economic output . 
  how does that apply to italy ? 
  our foreign population absorbs only the 1,75 % of italy 's expenses but they contribute far more than that . 
  lol, 
   these foreigners that account for 9,1 % of business activities are not north african or middle eastern illegal migrants nope . 
  12 % of those activities are run by moroccans which are by far the nationality with the highest number of entrepreneurs even though they represent only the 8,7 % of the foreign population . 
  even then he would be wrong , considering the fact that moroccans , tunisians and egyptians are three of the five most `` business oriented '' foreign nationalities in italy ( the other two are chinese and albanians ) . 
  in italy there are 500000 activities run by foreigners , moroccans alone run 60000 of those activities ( 12 % ) even though they represent only the 8,7 % of our foreign population . 
  and yet foreigners , who represent only the 8,3 % of the total population , account for the 8,8 % of the country 's gdp ; 9,1 % of business activities are run by foreigners , with 96 billions of value added yearly ; 8,7 % of irpef is covered by foreigners and foreigners alone pay 11 billion euros in social security contributions . 
  all of this despite the fact that foreigners are paid less than italians to do the same job . 
  but yeah , they are totally an economic burden for us . 
  of those countries only turkey and russia can be considered authoritarian regimes . 
  the hungarian government likes to talk big but it 's still far from being an authoritarian regime . 
  in turkey and russia journalists and political opponents are arrested or killed , lots of websites are banned or blocked , medias are censored or tightly controlled by the government . 
  none of this happens in brazil , czechia or hungary . 
  we lack ghettoes like molenbeek or the french banlieues , and for this reason kids born from foreign parents are brought up just like any other italian kid . 
  and although self-segregation is a very important matter to address , as we 've seen with the recent surge of terrorist attacks , it * must * not be the driving factor when discussing all issues correlated with immigration , such as that of citizenship . 
  because there are people who choose not to adapt to the culture and costumes of the country they 're living in , doesnt ' mean that other people , who instead live and abide by the rules of that nation , should be stripped of their sacrosant rights like citizenship . 
  even more so when they were born and grew up in said country !, 
  you 're referring to the same guy ( me ) . 
  what higher standards ? 
  how can you get more italian when you 're raised in the country speaking its language and consuming its media ( tv , radio , newspapers ) , educated in its schools , surrounded by its culture and its traditions ?!, 
  what else do you need to be considered citizen of a nation ? 
   miserable citizenship amendment what 's miserable about it ? 
  so a kid born , raised and educated in italy should not be granted citizenship ? 
  because we already tried that and we were fined by the european court of human rights when we sent migrants back to libya ... 
  yeah , speak for yourself . 
  you so edgy . 
  i would n't be so sure .
