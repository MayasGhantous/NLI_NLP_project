  if some parallels can be drawn between turks and russians , then i think sanctions could potentially exacerbate the situation and make erdo\u011fan 's supporters even more oblivious to reality . 
  instilling an us vs them mentality in less educated people , which i gather are his staunchest supporters , is easier than people might think . 
  belgium is the only correct answer . 
  ehm , last time we sent migrants back to libya we were fined by the european court of human rights and we were obliged to pay each one of them 15000 euros . 
  if we send them back we get fined , if we do n't we 're `` running a ferry-service for migrants '' . 
  what the hell should we do ? 
  a very insightful dissection on your part , pal . 
  friulian , ladin and slovene in the northeast , franco-proven\u00e7al in the northwest ( and apulia ) . 
  there is also croatian in molise , occitan in piedmont and calabria , catalan in sardinia but they 're all spoken by just a handful of people . 
  anyway , unintelligibility with italian should not be the main requirement when it comes to the recognition of the `` dialects '' of italy as standalone languages . 
  yeah , corsican is fairly close to medieval tuscan . 
  as a matter of fact , i think that it 's easier for us to understand corsican than many other dialects spoken in italy . 
  i would still call it a language , though . 
   some 15000 children were schooled in breton in 2013  corsican is mandatory for primary-school students but optional for secondary-school students . 
  still better than italy . 
  did i say that ? 
  i said that we should not stop helping people in fear that some of them might do fucked up things . 
  how can this be controversial ? 
   life of one refugee is worth the lives of ten poles i doubt she actually said that , but since i do n't speak polish i can not say whether you 're telling the truth or not . 
   its good deal to accept 7000 of them because even if there would be 1 terrorist who would blow him up its not big deal because the rest 6999 should not be suicidal and you find this unreasonable ? 
  so we should stop helping people in need because some of them might be terrorists ? 
  he speaks italian with a ( fake ) sicilian accent . 
  it was like this even before 1946 . 
  when italy was still a kingdom , we had 59 different governments in just 61 years ( 1861-1922 ) , and 65 governments in 85 years ( 1861-1946 ) ( mussolini 's government lasted 21 years ) . 
  we 've always worked this way . 
  bar the part about european liberties and values , this video reads like a mussolini 's speech to be honest . 
  especially the civilizing mission thing sounds eerily similar to fascist rhetorics . 
  i really do n't understand if this video was meant to be taken seriously or not . 
  hope it was n't . 
  ehm , i obviously knew romanian was a romance language , i just did not think i could understand much of it , especially when spoken . 
  maybe a few words here and there , but not entire sentences . 
  the fact that two languages are related does n't say much about mutual intelligibility . 
  for example , of the main romance languages , french is the closest there is to italian , yet when spoken it is almost unintelligible to us . 
  til i can understand some romanian . 
  but a sense of germanness already existed in all german states when frederick ii was alive , so it 's fair to consider him as such . 
  `` italian '' as a cultural and linguistic concept , instead , came to be more than a thousand years after caesar 's death so it 's not really the same thing . 
  he was a roman , though . 
  well he was a great general and a fervent revolutionary but i do n't think he can be considered a great conqueror . 
  i do n't think we even have a great conqueror . . 
   speaking some actual italian dialect , like florentine or romanesco or venetian first of all , neither florentine nor romanesco are * actual * dialects of italian , let alone venetian as it is n't even clear if it belongs to the italo-dalmatian group ( like italian ) or to the gallo-italic group of romance languages . 
  second of all , speaking with an accent and speaking a dialect are two different things . 
  i very much doubt that people were able to ** speak ** romanesco or venetian after a couple of months spent in rome or venice . 
  [ antonio razzi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhdu6ggfj5g ) for sure . 
  he 's an idiot who barely speaks italian and who thinks that north korea is where it 's at , with its clean streets and its love for the dear leader . 
  he 's also convinced that he can prevent a nuclear war between n.k. 
  and the us because he 's `` friend '' with kim jong un . 
  we used to but nowadays i 'd say no , mostly due to our own faults . 
   wanting annexation to austria , where they would loose their special status as an autonomous region , but you know , `` m-muh germanic heritage '' but they 're austrians for fuck 's sake !, 
  so , since they have special privileges they should just accept the fact that they 're part of a country they 've nothing in common with ? 
  yeah , i do n't understand why for us it 's so hard to accept that different people have different tastes and that some of them might prefer italian-like food over authentic italian food . 
  but we eat pizza with our bare hands . . 
  anyway , i 've spent quite some time in the us and i can see why some people might prefer american pizza over ours : more toppings , a lot more cheese , stronger flavours etc. 
  i think ours is way better , but having actually tried american style pizza i 'm fine with some people preferring that style of pizza over ours . 
   nonetheless the invention of pizza is typically attributed to italian diaspora in nyc , during the immigration wave at the turn of the 20th century . 
  do n't know if you 're joking or you 're being serious . 
  am abruzzese , for us `` central southern '' works just fine . 
  personally , i call myself * meridionale * in the north , but * centrale * in the south . 
  that 's not a stereotype . 
  it 's reality . 
  that it 's common for a husbands to hit his wife . 
  do n't know if this stereotype is common in europe , though , but it definitely was in the us . 
  also , that all italians have dark hair and olive skin . 
  even in sicily that is not true ( plenty of blondes and redheads ) . 
  calvino is very fun to read . 
  if you can find an english version , i 'd suggest `` i nostri antenati '' ( * our ancestors * ) or `` il sentiero dei nidi di ragno '' ( * the path to the nest of spiders * ) . 
  the agnelli family , which owns fiat/fca as well as juventus fc , is by far the most famous . 
  come on now , [ berlusconi was quite attractive when he was young ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=berlusconi+giovane&amp;hl=it&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjt3ztwlfdtahwcb5okhunkbsoq_auibigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638#imgrc=gnvd9mj8qdmxim: ),

  the battle lasts only a couple of hours per day , sadly . 
  there are no real men left on this world today !, 
  in ivrea , piedmont , they have the traditional [ battle of the oranges ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqm4j-mqje0 ) , in which people from different neighbourhoods of the town throw oranges at each others for three consecutive days until one team is declared winner . 
  do n't worry , i really do think that your version works better , 
  yeah i agree , it does work better . 
  fuck me , that works way better . 
  btw , the original one goes like this : * \u00e8 des minute chi sun piemunteis e gi\u00e0 sti napuli rumpu el bale * . 
  incest , i 'd guess . 
  ahaha i know . 
  a neapolitan family wants to become piedmontese . 
  one day they read on a newspaper that , in order to become piedmontese , one must swim across the po river from one bank to another . 
  full of hope , they leave naples and once arrived to their destination , knowing what to do , they start to cross the river . 
  first goes the father . 
  the crossing is hard , but once on the other bank of the river , he already feels different : he wants to work , he wants to be honest , he does not want to live at the expenses of others and , most of all , he does n't want to steal anymore . 
  thrilled with joy , he exhorts his wife to join him . 
  his wife starts to swim . 
  for her the crossing is harder , but with a lot of effort she manages to reach her husband on the other bank . 
  like him she now wants to work , be honest and does not want to steal or live at the expenses of others anymore . 
  they both then tell their son to join them . 
  he starts swimming , but the crossing for him is even harder . 
  the current is too strong for his forces and he is too young to cross the river all alone . 
  fearing for his own safety , he starts to call his father for help : - * dad please help me , i can not do it alone * . 
  but the father ignores him , so the son goes again : - * dad , please , help me . 
  i need your help * . 
  no response whatsoever . 
  the son tries again : - * daddy please , i 'm begging you , help me !, 
  * at this point the father , red with anger , says to his wife : - * you see ?!, 
  i 've been piedmontese for less than ten minutes and there is already a neapolitan asking me for something !, 
  * edit : better ending , as suggested by / u/ilarea, 
  the roman accent is also `` funny '' but it gets quite tiring after a while . 
  italian is basically the same across the country .
