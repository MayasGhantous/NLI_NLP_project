i 'm sorry to say it but i think this ban is actually very reasonable when it concerns other customers being around . 
  it 's part of the integration process . 
  when you migrate to another country you kinda have to lose a bit of your identity on the other hand i really do n't understand why they ca n't speak polish during their break . 
  maybe they do n't want segregation among their ethnically different workers ? 
  i do n't know . 
  fuck cold . 
  climate change ftw . 
  i do n't know . 
  that same quote could be a good argument for the elitists/oligarchs . 
  they 're a minority as well , as minority is only a mathematical definition . 
  but what your concept of truth orbits around ( justice , compassion , tolerance , moderation , reason and sustainability ) are very subjective matters . 
  so even by your own definiton there 's basically no one truth , only my truth , your truth and so on . 
  we only have facts and for every fact there 's thousand interpretations and thus truths each one tailored around the speaker 's interests and views . 
  that 's why i totally ditch the word truth ( especially in politics ) and i 'm very suspicious on any politician that claims to be the bearer of truth . 
  facts on the other hand are sterile and are the only true starting point for everything . 
  anything else beyond that is superstructure , even my own values which i deem true for myself only . 
  i 'd like to know where you read that the truth rests with kierkegaard ... btw there 's no truth , only interests . 
  each one , or even better each group , tries to advocate for their own interests . 
  so this so-called truth is conveniently defined as achieving the goals of the majority . 
  it 's just because you do n't know him . 
  the only true pro-europe force actually left in italy . 
  italy ca n't just give them any official permission , cause this law comes from an international treaty ( dublin treaty i guess ) . 
  instead people pretend not to see migrants or asylum seekers ( which are basically the same thing until they ask for asylum ) travelling across italy towards germany/sweden . 
  did you really have to go all the way to britain to find a weirdo ? 
  i 'd like to know which country it is . 
  they teach french anywhere ?? 
  til, 
  who are these people you 're talking about ? 
  they do n't exist , you 're lying . 
  most of them are economic migrants . 
  true  the people that would qualify for refugee status do n't have the resources to make the trip . 
  not true . 
  i do n't know maybe because italy is the 4th economy of europe and the 3rd of the eurozone right after germany and france . 
  and the benelux , well it 's the benelux ... 
  ok , good toknow . 
  it also says that italy in pigs was often replaced by ireland in the early 2000 's . 
  maybe that 's where my confusion comes from . 
  that 's the point . 
  we 're part of the piigs but not the pigs which does not include italy . 
   she has stated that she 's personally `` uncomfortable '' with adoption rights but if she 's serious about equal treatment in front of the law she has to eliminate that difference that 's exactly my point . 
  she wants everyone to compliment her for completing the marathon even though she stopped 200 meters before the finish line . 
  you do n't want to complete the course ? 
  fine , but do n't expect everyone 's so dumb to say you did . 
  because that piece of discrimination is still there whether she considers it such or not . 
  but at the same time she does n't want to be viewed as `` bad '' or `` backwards '' . 
  she wants it all . 
   she stated that she is willing to eliminate all legal differences between civil partnerships and marriages and wants to guarantee equal treatment , so that would obviously include adoption rights . 
  really ? 
  i find it hard to believe that she supports adoption from same-sex couples since she 's always opposed it explicitly . 
  for sure she does n't say she supports adoption in this interview where she only speaks about tax legislation and vaguely about discrimination in general . 
  if she took such a step forward it would need to be said clearly . 
  i 'm not talking about semantics alone . 
  civil partnership does n't grant the same rights as marriage . 
  there 's a difference between the two which accounts for the discrimination . 
  it 's ok if she wants to keep it this way but she ca n't be both progressive and conservative . 
  you either want equality or not . 
  there 's no such thing as semi-equality . 
  * discrimination is treatment or consideration of , or making a distinction in favor of or against , a person or thing based on the group , class , or category to which that person or thing belongs rather than on individual merit . 
  * so making a difference at some point that is based on a category alone ( in this case gender ) is a discrimination . 
  unfortunately ( or fortunately ) there 's a difference between marriage and civil parternships in germany which makes them not legally equal . 
  for example if two individuals fulfill the requirements to adopt except for their gender then you have a discrimination . 
  there 's no actual reason behind it and someone simply decided so according to their principles which supposedly reflect the majority of the voters . 
  merkel agrees with it , thus merkel discriminates . 
  it 's fair , but please do n't come running and say you do n't discriminate . 
   ' i do n't want discrimination ... but i make a difference at some point ' tune in next week when angela finds out that discrimination actually means * making a difference at some point * if you have certain beliefs at least own up to them . 
  germoney dindu nuffins !!!, 
  don shoot, 
  and that 's fine , but how ... how did the deaf basketball team catch it at the event ? 
  if you know what i mean . 
   i want to be able to point to my finger at a single person when shit goes wrong ( and ** that person to not automatically be merkel ** ) i 'm sorry but that last bit is n't feasible . 
  moon kebab , best kebab . 
  typical christian trying to belittle muslim accomplishments . 
  ok . much worse than i had anticipated . 
  pasta !!, 
  if only european rules had n't been carved into stone by god almighty himself !, 
  well , i guess we got ta roll with it . 
  - the * green-blue * languages are the ** western romance group ** . 
  - the * purplish-sandy * languages make up the ** eastern romance group ** . 
  so basically you can see how the split happens in italy where northern italy & the isle of sardinia belong to the western branch while all the rest from tuscany ( included ) downwards is eastern along with romanian . 
  the main difference between the two groups being how they form their plural . 
  western chose the plural marker - s while eastern prefers the plural marker `` change final vowel '' . 
  there are also other differences/similarities like shared vocabulary and so on but as a rule of thumb the more similar the colour the more related two languages are to one another . 
  geography comes in handy here because these regional languages tend to turn into one another in a sort of dialectal continuum . 
  so it 's clear why romanian is the most isolated from its sister languages . 
  in fact middle and southern italian languages is more intelligible with its western counterparts than with romanian despite being grouped with romanian in the eastern branch . 
  to sum it up , relationships among languages are more intricate and three-dimensional than any map or tree-like graph could ever suggest . 
  tomorrow , merkel has announced a referendum where the european people will decide if - wait a sec ... 
  6 months ? 
  more like 5 years . 
  yeah , best place in eastern italy . 
  `` plants '', 
  she hijacked an italian news reporter as well yesterday . 
  and saw her on tv harassing varoufakis this morning too , while he was laughing his ass off . 
  10/10 would shag . 
  77 % of the money to `` save greece '' actually went to french and german banks , and this money ultimately came from european tax-payers . 
  greece should also be thankful that this usury scam was done through a union and finance so no tanks or airstrikes were needed . 
  they let them in knowing that they cheated . 
  it 's not like they did n't manage to catch them , they deliberately chose not to because it was much more convenient . 
  god , i hope not . 
  everyone knew about them cheating and let them in anyway .
