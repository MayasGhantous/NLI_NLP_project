  role-playing 's never been as old . 
   the weakest being the one that lied it self into the eu in the first place . 
  yeah , and everybody else knew and gladly let them in so i guess we 've got more than one liar in the house . 
  also you do realise how profitable , both economically and politically , it is to have someone constantly in debt paying you back the interests . 
  german and french banks know this all too well and have been also very pleased to receive support from eu to cover their exposure on greece . 
  there 's some games one can play in greece but not in lithuania , every playground is different and brings different joys to the player . 
   as long as it would be better than the alternative for finland i ' l agree on that to some degree . 
  the issue here is that since the euro was created a unification was the only way not to fuck it all up . 
  complaining now about being too close to eachother and sharing too much of the pain is nonsensical . 
   besides on this referendum greece rejected the rules given by the euro area , so what are you talking about when you say `` european union thing is getting ridiculous . '' ? 
  for a bunch of reasons really . 
  but in this particular case it 's that there 's little left of the union in the european union . 
  you can live by these rules given by the euro area for as long as you want but would you keep doing it just for the sake of respecting even if they were wrong and bound to make everything collapse ? 
  german really has a word for everything . 
   i sincerely hope that the last few months bring to light the need to advance further the european project . 
  yeah i 'm sure a little bit more of austerity will do the trick ... 
   and that uniformity to me speaks of union really ? 
  chopping off the weakest link at the first chance ? 
  how long before someone else shows some kind of problem like mass immigration from the sea , or a noisy neighbour like russia for instance ? 
  how long before it 's you to get sandfucked in the butt in the next round ? 
  every european country is using the others as a meat shield , nothing more . 
  i say beware of these `` allies '' . 
   a referendum among the european people or among the politicians of the individual countries ? 
  from wikipedia : a referendum is a direct vote in which ** an entire electorate ** is asked to vote on a particular proposal, 
  nope . 
  try and run a referendum on lending money to greece right now . 
  not a single country would approve of it . 
   so i guess unified europe to you means common responsibility for debt . 
  well that 's a no then for me too . 
  i 'd like to know why people thought that a single currency would 've lasted long without unifying debt , the job market , tax system and so on . 
  you either go all the way or it 'll fall apart eventually . 
  this european union thing is getting ridiculous . 
  we 're a bunch of back-stabbing motherfuckers who 're waiting to screw each other over for as long as possible . 
  in the last few months i went from being pro-eu to anti-eu , and not because of how it was built but because we 'll never overcome our different interests not in our lifetime . 
  yeah i know , i was just getting the chat going  the moment when the switch happens both the new employee and the early retiree feel great but as soon as you upscale it , extend to a fairly big chunk of the population and keep it going for a few years you 'll be in for a huge breakdown ... 
   to create job positions ? 
  that 's a common misconception . 
  with early retirement you 're not actually * creating * anything , more like recycling . 
  thus it 's merely an optical illusion so to speak . 
  only investments are able to create new jobs . 
  we are founding members of eu ... 
  we can still make it if we take a hold of merkel 's change in her pocket !, 
   i have a hard time seeing republicans trying to cater to immigrant voters . 
  but they will cater to ethnic minorities eventually . 
  american demographics is rapidly changing . 
  if i 'm not mistaken 2009 was the first year where 51 % of newborn babies were in fact non-white or white + another race . 
  no , no , no hear this . 
  this will be way worse , like ` the 2nd world war 2 ', 
  note to self : watch more danish comedies . 
  yeah , but the rest of the world does . 
  well you 're british though since you live in one of the two british isles . 
  edit : * british *  adjective british ( comparative more british , superlative most british ) : - of britain ( ** meaning the british isles ** ) - of the united kingdom . 
  - of the commonwealth of nations , or the british empire . 
  ( historical ) of the ancient inhabitants of the southern part of britain ; brythonic . 
  - of british english . 
  said charlie hebdo 's editorial staff ... 
  it 's really surprising to hear considering finland 's stand on european economic issues lately . 
  katainen gets called a ` hawk ' here in italy for his strict views . 
   so a person can not change the ideals they believe in ? 
  i believe there 's a reason these fighters are coming back yeah , either that or they come back to carry out some terrorist attack . 
  they effectively joined a state that supports the annihilation of western countries ( at least that 's what they 'd love to see ) . 
  isis is an enemy and we ca n't be oblivious to that . 
  as an irish yourself you most likely have a very unique pronunciation of the th sounds anyway . 
  but even then , you should hear a big difference when you say the th in * think * versus * that * . 
  frankly italy is n't exactly looking at estonia or latvia when it comes to easing the burden of immigration/refugees ... 
  but if you lump together all of eastern europe it 's different . 
  without going as far as eastern europe , france has had the same reaction . 
  that is n't how they phrased it obviously . 
  diplomats do n't talk like that . 
  they basically said that they 're already taking care of `` ukrainian refugees '' when asked about mediterranean immigration these days . 
   and how exactly is pulling back sanctions against putin going to help ? 
  help ? 
  who said it 's going to help ? 
  renzi specifically said that if europe wants to leave italy alone , italy `` will hurt europe '' . 
   besides , i do n't think anyone in eastern europe is saying it 's not their problem yep they said so . 
  but renzi 's move , whatever that is , will hurt more france , germany , austria and europe in general . 
  not longer than month ago on eu summit everyone agreed there needed to be a redistribution of refugees or something now one by one all the countries have turned their back and said no thanks . 
   if italy wanted help to find , intercept and turn back the boats , i 'm sure all countries would pitch in willingly . 
  they might not be willing to participate in the current insane policy of accepting and even aiding all migrants to reach europe . 
  everyone 's being shady and hypocritical about it , italy included . 
  even in the media we do n't make a clear distinction between refugees and illegal migrants . 
  i 'm sure a little bit of shock therapy might help clear the air of everyone 's bullshit and make everyone realise that whatever we do about immigration it must be done together . 
  do we want to expel the illegal immigrants ? 
  let 's do it through european measures without having to resort to to each country 's legislation which is tedious , long , and costly . 
  moreover i 'm sick of europe that lectures , and sanctions italy about immigration and then places tanks on the italian border to prevent the immigrants to enter their country . 
  eastern europe . 
   you are obviously some sort of troll , who claimed earlier today that foreigners in sweden are more against immigration than swedes you 're not very familiar with hyperbole , are n't you ? 
   those who voted for the green-reds in september 2014 probably did n't know that the local folkets hus in rinkeby , an immigrant ghetto in stockholm , would cancel a meeting about islam in june 2015 . 
  i was n't referring to this particular event but to the general attitude in sweden . 
  the mindset , the political correctness is well known to swedes and apparently most agree with it . 
  they chose to put aside a bit of their own identity to make room for integration and this is the kind of thing that happens everyday little by little and in the small things of life . 
  sometimes it 's newsworthy sometimes it 's not . 
  now , if you did n't see it coming it 's your own problem but it was obvious . 
  integration comes with a little price to pay , like everything in life and sweden seems willing to take the bill . 
   why do you have an italian flair when you 're american ? 
  do n't you dare insult me with such a filthy slur . 
   no , that 's not how it works does n't it ? 
  well teach me then . 
  exactly , if that tickles their fancy it 's fine . 
  it 's not my thing but it 's fine .
