  guys , guys slow down a little bit . 
  ** this is all speculation ** and renzi still has n't unveiled his plan-b if europe completely turns its back to italy . 
  rumor has it ** italy might even pull back the sanctions against russia and putin ** . 
  this would be a huge blow to europe especially at this particular time . 
  eastern europe says mediterranean immigration is not their problem ? 
  then putin is n't italy 's problem . 
  i do n't know if all these rumors are just rumors or are being leaked by the government itself . 
  all i know is it 's gon na be `` fun '' to watch . 
   speech on democracy and freedom of religion halted oh the irony !, 
  btw as i understand it the social democrats and the greens were elected by the swedes . 
  thus the swedes agree with how things are going . 
  i would n't ever support such policies but who am i to judge the swedes on their democratic choices ? 
  if this is the way they want it then let them have it . 
  everya organizationa goesa througha rougha patchesa buta thea eua willa seea througha . 
  i thought i could lend a hand so here 's a translation into italian . 
  no need to thank me . 
  oh thanks for the automatically * \u00fcbersetzed * article . 
   some of them come from ` safe ' countries , all of them have already finished the asylum process in italy . 
  really ? 
  they finished the asylum process in italy ???? 
  that 's an accomplishment for us . 
  you know , on average it takes 2 years for authorities to determine whether an asylum seeker is effectively a refugee or just an illegal immigrant and then do nothing about it in either case . 
  proud moment for my country right now . 
   it is pretty much nonsense to construe a right to stay in hamburg out of the western engagement in libya ( which germany didnt even take part in ) . 
  i could n't make any sense of what that guy was saying ( sorry , not good with accents and sound quality is bad ! ), 
  so i trust you with the information about the rights he claims to have . 
  anyway these people are n't even libyan , they come from countries below the sahara so i do n't know why western engagement in overthrowing gaddaffi would have anything with their right to live anywhere in europe , granted they 're not refugees from nigeria or something . 
  i 'm not your bro , dawg . 
  i see you become less talkative when presented with proof . 
  that 's good . 
  but you still seem to be unable to follow up on finer reasoning such as political far-sightedness and international relations which have nothing to do with morality but everything to do with france being politically blind and recklessly causing awful consequences for everyone . 
  i agree with you 100 % . 
  i 'm really fond of languages and dutch is a particularly * gezellige * one . 
  i would hate to see languages disappear . 
  however languages influence each other all the time and often receive buttload of words and expression in situations of bilingualism ( think middle english and old norman french ) but then only a small part of it eventually sticks . 
  language contact is a language 's evolutionary process just as natural as time passing by . 
  and i take it for granted that you 're not resentful for speaking modern dutch instead of old dutch . 
  so dope , bruh !, 
  * swag *, 
  lol in sweden you find more people against immigration among immigrants than among native swedes  anyway the attitude towards immigration is n't an on-off switch where you 're either in favour or against no matter what . 
  it 's more of a spectrum and even among the lefties , especially the older ones , you 'll find those who wo n't go beyond a certain limit . 
  obviously this reasoning does n't include the extreme left . 
  likewise the centre-right often has a generally positive attitude towards immigration such as in italy . 
  more immigrants = more people noticing and having an opinion about it . 
  that 's all , and it concerns europe not only as a subreddit but also as a continent . 
  maybe you have n't realised this because you live in croatia and ( i suppose ? ), 
  you have n't been hit by the migrants and refugees wave . 
  this is just an assumption based solely on your flair though . 
   yeah sure , totally rewrite the chronology of events that are only 4 years old , nobody will call you out for that . 
  if only the internet had a way to save the chronology of the events through the news articles that were written at that time ... [ here ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/hillarys-war-how-conviction-replaced-skepticism-in-libya-intervention/2011/10/28/giqahgs7wm_story.html ) how hilary clinton talks about berlusconi being mad about france 's decision to unilaterally attack libya . 
  he even threatened to not lend italian basis for the no-fly zone and accused sarkozy of overriding un maybe it was n't important news in your country but this is common knowledge in italy because we saw the situation unfold before our eyes . 
  this is a 2011 article about how berlusconi was at the theater celebrating 150 years since italy 's unification . 
  sorry it 's in italian and could n't find any english source but it says how italy 's major representatives were reached by the news that france would 've attacked libya the next day no matter what . 
   not what happened . 
  france and the uk did n't take libya 's oil . 
  it was only air strikes . 
  no presence on the ground , read the article . 
  that 's exactly what happened . 
  maybe you should read a bit more than a wikipedia article before you 're so sure about something and french total got a big advantage in the aftermath of the revolution and later lost it . 
  the fact that france did n't ultimately succeed in its goal makes sarkozy look even more stupid because he caused this mess for nothing . 
   link your sources . 
  moreover , the libyan situation is not worse than before the operation at all . 
  here 's for you a source from der spiegel from february 2011 where [ some italian representatives predict the future ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/libyan-crisis-italy-warns-of-a-new-wave-of-immigrants-to-europe-a-747459.html ) . 
  this is just one excerpt from it : `` italian ministers now warn that if his libyan government collapses , people will flow across the mediterranean : a ` biblical exodus ' '' moreover europe 's initial involvement was a no-fly zone and italy repeatedly warned the allies not to abruptly overthrow gaddafi during the following days . 
   the libyan situation is not worse than before the operation at all . 
  wow this is the final token that shows you do n't have the slightest idea of what you 're talking about . 
  - libya today does n't exist anymore as a state , - it is nobody 's land where there 's one internationally recognized government that barely controls its patch of land , - another newborn government in another city that aims to eradicate the first one , - about 130 tribes that claim their own rights to power and land - islamic fundamentalism has never thrived more in libya - isis affiliates control and profit on the migrants ships to italy and europe . 
  but yeah situation is not worse < this is sarcasm by the way . 
   yeah sure , they warned and then immediatly bombed the country . 
  they 're really committed to their opinions !, 
   france warned about iraq and did france bombed iraq ? 
  no they stayed out of it . 
  because if you know a retarded guy that you can not stop , you at least join in to try and influence the course of the events , maybe limit the damage rather than turn your head the other way . 
  italy had economic interests in libya and france saw a chance to get a slice of the cake through `` unorthodox means '' . 
  italy wanted to defend its interest and , as the source i linked to you proves , knew beforehand that the aftermath of the bullshit arab spring/gaddafi overthrowing would have been nothing but chaos and migrants ships from everywhere and italy would have been the first ( but not the last ) one to pay the consequences . 
   total got kicked out of the country yeah now , you 're right but total was the first major international oil company to ramp up production in the aftermath of the uprising . 
  the fact that france did n't ultimately succeed in its plan does n't mean they did n't try , actually it makes sarkozy look even worse . 
  france decided overnight to attack libya and as the airplanes already took off italy had to decide whether to join along and thus have a chance to defend its interest in libya or watch from afar and let france and england split the loot among themselves ... italy warned against eliminating gaddafi because chaos would 've ensued soon after but no one listened and fast forward ... guess who was right ? 
   italy is a grown up country able to makes its own decision . 
  so is france and just like any other grown up it should 've owned up to its own mistakes . 
  i thought we all had learnt that the approach of `` remove dictator , install democracy and leave asap '' did n't work , but no . 
  so it 's just a coincidence that france used their military prowess only on libya 's dictator and now has good deals for that sweet , sweet libyan oil ... 
  but i 'm sure france is going to liberate many other countries without oil anytime now . 
  it 's neither * viewed * or * perceived * at all . 
   the two are inextricably linked , and the fact that they are inextricably linked is precisely the reason why we ca n't just send back every boat that comes over the sea . 
  what about those who do not apply for asylum at all ? 
  or what about those who go through the process but are then denied the status ? 
  the emergency at sea is one thing , but once they 've been long rescued , they 've been on our soil for 1-2 years and they 're not refugees that 's illegal immigration with no ambiguity whatsoever . 
  frankly if italy only had to deal with boats full of deserving asylum seekers we would n't be facing such a crisis . 
  only about 20 ' 000 people got asylum in italy . 
  we could take care of them pretty easily on our own , but then politics and the electorate have all the right to discuss and then decide how strict they want to be when it comes to illegal immigrants ( months , years after they 've been rescued at sea ) . 
  expulsion is a valid option cause no international regulation prevents that . 
  and also they should decide on how severely expulsion should be enforced , if that 's the case because their 's many shades of strictness on that regard . 
  that 's why / u/maestroni 's referendum proposal has nothing to do with refugees by itself . 
   in order for you to be an illegal migrant you 'd have to be in the country illegally , it 's not illegal to seek asylum those who apply for asylum are not many among immigrants , and even less are those who are granted such a status . 
   why would you need to have a referendum on something that 's already illegal , unless you wanted it to be legal ? 
  it 's not only about declaring it illegal but the policy a country adopts on how to treat illegal immigration : what are the measures that ought to be enforced once said immigrant is proven to be illegal ( that is he 's not applied or he 's been denied asylum ) ? 
  do we want a strict regulation or one that is looser ? 
  the answer varies from country to country and it 's up the people/representatives to come up with what they feel more comfortable with . 
  a referendum is one of the democratic tools that could clear the air on the issue .
