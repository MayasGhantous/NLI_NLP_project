  uk/ca/us / au/nz all belong to a different way of thinking they have their common language and so on . 
  basically the same things / u/trucidator pointed out . 
  the turks have a lot in common with the balkans and by extension with the rest of europe but as i said i do n't consider them to be actually europeans for the same reasons as you provided . 
  you 're one of those filthy apples . 
  god i hate apples like you . 
  finally someone said it . 
  imho turkey is more european than the uk , and i do n't even consider turkey to be * truly * europe . 
  the uk should just stop the teasing and the eu should end a marriage of convenience that was never meant to be . 
  oranges should stay with oranges and apples with apples . 
  too many flags i do n't recognize . 
   i used to say `` could of '' when i was younger well , kids i can understand because as you said could have can be reduced to sound exactly like could of . 
   `` brought '' instead of `` bought '' . 
  sometimes it happened to me too but i do n't about everyone else . 
  although it 's a different kind of mistake like a slip of the tongue , is n't it ? 
  do n't be rude guys . 
  he came all the way here to earth just so he could learn what a smile is . 
   if someone says `` could of '' the correction is not necessary because only native speakers make that mistake not necessary ? 
  really ? 
  from my point of view anyone who thinks they can `` of '' something should be reminded that they 're the reason why humanity is falling apart . 
   a mistake like writing `` independant '' is worth correcting in my opinion . 
  if i wrote something like that my automatic spell check would instantly point it out . 
  so pretty useless for those like me . 
   correcting grammar mistakes , especially when people use the wrong tense , seems pretty useful . 
  yeah , corrections on grammar , syntax and advanced word usage would be awesome however . 
  it 's cool and all as long as it does n't come to correcting someone who says `` gotcha ! '', 
  with `` i suppose it should be written down as * i got you * , sir '' . 
  * sami lesbian wheelchair parents . 
   / r/europe should be better than that . 
  excuse me , who decided that ? 
  can you be any more slytherin than than ? 
  it gets more and more current if anything . 
  [ it 's really nothing to worry about ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1ee465_copy-of-simpsons-soviet-union_fun ) ... 
  as if we needed an announcement to find out that water is wet . 
  wow , so the netherlands does have mountains !, 
  great , now you can explain them in spanish that you 're not a latino and spain is n't mexico . 
  you probably missed my sarcasm  i thought my comment was douchbaggy enough to make it obvious but apparently it 's just too real ... 
  exactly . 
  non-vote is the only option for a true intelligent lefty . 
  because no existing party could ever match the keenness of my mind . 
   i would n't trust eu military that juncker was talking about recently as i am afraid germany and italy would be just deeply concerned and talk about peace plan when baltics are being invaded . 
  you just hit the spot right there . 
  a single military could only work for a single united country . 
  until the interests of a single member become the interests of the whole union/country there 's no point in setting up a single army which would be invariably shaped around the interests of the strongest within the union . 
  so first make a united states of europe or another federation of some kind or whatever and then we 'll talk military more thoroughly . 
  in a way that 's exactly what happened with the euro . 
  it 's not in italy but i ca n't help it : ladies and gentlemen let me introduce you to [ fucking , austria . ], 
  - said the sad troll ... 
  maybe you would have if you looked at their cellphones instead of staring at their bulge . 
  at least i 'm not a 100 % verified pedophile like yourself though . 
   i think all politicians are big fat liers trying to line their pockets wow , that 's bleak . 
  but i ca n't blame you for thinking that . 
  the key word here is * probably * . 
  and * probably * does n't get you to jail . 
   are they even legal migrants ? 
  i do n't know about those immigrants who did that to / u/cieloroto in particular but i can safely say that italian laws have almost no effect against illegal immigration . 
  in 2013 only 0.9 % of illegals in italy were expelled . 
  on the other hand however there 's also us italians to blame . 
  lawmakers/police is way too tolerant of these behaviours . 
  unlicensed vendors can freely roam the most popular sites in big cities with little to no hassle by officers . 
  also because officers have no effective means to contrast them other than dispatch them until they come back again . 
   silly question but how is what they do legal ? 
  what they did to / u/cieloroto is perfectly legal even if an officer sees it . 
  the officer can only do something if the offended person formally asks for help against the scammer . 
  obviously tourists are more easy to target because they feel disoriented when such a thing happens to them in a foreign country . 
  i know that because they showed this scam on tv a couple days ago and interviewed the officers who stood there and did nothing . 
  btw i do n't mean to say that immigrants are the only ones who commit crimes in italy obviously . 
  but some of them have surely found a fertile land in italy where they 're less bothered . 
   it 's the one thing that made him somewhat likable to me  lol i 'm kinda puzzled right now . 
  nope . 
  [ that is an impersonator ] ( http://www.sosia.biz/files/immagini/1193325017-berlusconi%202.jpg ) . 
  this same guy also did stuff like that like picking his nose . 
  the low quality of the videos/picturs coupled with the fact that foreigners are n't very familiar with berlusconi 's face can easily trick you . 
  however these skits have never fooled anybody in italy . 
  we know berlusconi 's face all too well ... 
  yeah , ukraine is basically * europe 's homeland * . 
  i 'm having a hard time understanding how the fuck this guy is still a free man . 
  here i am . 
  the thing is that you do n't go to jail just for being lame . 
  that said , he * probably * did some sketchy stuff as an entrepreneur ( * cough * mafia * cough * ) before going into politics . 
  that 's not him , though . 
  sinks are for hands . 
  bidets are for dicks . 
  one should n't mix the two up . 
   how aggressive the ` street vendors ' and like 99 % of them is not even italian ( north-western africans and middle easterners ) . 
  they mostly target tourists like you . 
  we have it in italy as well . 
  soap is said to be a gaulish invention . 
  or at least they made it popular . 
  you should n't completely rule out the possibility that it 's actually growing day by day like a living being . 
  that 's what everyone thinks . 
  but we 'll be doing it anyway cause russians do n't expect it by now , and we be like `` gotcha ! '', 
  you knew it !, 
  that pencil mustache was a dead giveaway !!, 
  we 're gon na go out with austria and take over russia instead . 
  do n't even bother leaving a message on our answering machines saying you 're sorry . 
  being young and catholic nowadays is * mostly * like joining a facebook group : you say you 're part of it but after doing that you completely forget about it and live your life independently . 
  i think you mistook poland for africa . 
  people will use condoms even if they 're catholic , whether a pope says it or not . 
  sadly enough his opinion as the head of eu commission weighs just a little bit more than any of us guys ' comments here on reddit . 
  a daydream , nothing more .
