  renzi 's salaries is low because he is not a mp, 
   since it 's a european project , it 's unlikely to ever succeed i would n't say that : tornato , eurofighter , the freench-italian ships , the german-italian u-212 , nh-90 . . 
  i 'm from italy and i would like to move to sweden, 
  ( 1 % : if they give me a lot of money ... ) i do n't like driving ( hell i hate having a car !, 
  ) , i like our social system ( school and healthcare ) . 
  i think what suit me best would be germany or scandinavia so ... *, 
  in italy we use them to make some money http://museocanova.it/, 
  he can change is name to o'bama , and run for another 2 , then barry obama , then barry o'bama , barrack obama + o'bama and ... well you see where i am going . 
  oh yeah , idaho , oregon and washington are kind my `` if i have to move out i want to go live there '' states . 
  but i also have a weird fetish for albuquerque : desert and yet people with jacket . 
  that is our way to silently conquer europe . 
  if you are interested you can visit the dam . 
  we - italy - had a deal with ghaddafi but then sarko and his pal dodgy dave were masturbating together and decided to ask barry o'bama and hillary hoe to help them gain some oil . 
  and now we have to deal with this shit again . 
  right now the only flag there is up there is the one that belongs to the old france . 
  majani , for the `` cremino fiat '' caffarel : `` gianduiotto '' and also the '' [ cioccolato di modica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cioccolato_di_modica ) '',

  looks like the campaign map of the great [ medieval total war ] ( http://media.moddb.com/cache/images/games/1/1/130/thumb_620x2000/medieval_total_war_campaign.jpg ) . 
  when you have spain that comes out with nothing after the fuentes thing i do believe they are entitled to cry out about cospiracy . 
  sounds like a good deal to me . 
  since thet do n't consider themself spanish are they going to grant citizenship to all the non-spanish ? 
  where do i apply ? 
  so they are going to secede , create a border , an army , a real functioning sovereign government , a currency . 
  and the next day they are going to apply to join the eu wich means adopt euro , no border , no real autonomy on laws and regulation and if they join the nato their new army will have co military excercise with the spanish and be a member of the multinational brigade based in spain . 
  i guess they truly like to be independent . 
  been in kuopio for 6 months ( 01-06/2010 ) for the erasmus program . 
  it was awesome . 
  it 's quite good at the moment except for the fact that there is battlestar galactica but not stargate . 
  the problem was that russia took only 2-3 weeks for the mobilization of their army instead of the 6 weeks . 
  well we did n't have a de gaulle figure after the wwii so we are stuck with your fourth constitution . 
  i 'm still pissed that tolstoj did n't get it . 
  in this era where work is considered a commodity there is not such things as `` loyalty '' . 
  and yet to be a really good doctor you do n't need to go to harvard . 
  they can make you sign whatever they want bur `` ubi maior minor cessat '', 
  well , trump and brexit will male us unite even more , that is the positive thing, 
  is clinton going to prison now ? 
  well now you really ca n't say anything about berlusconi anymore , can you ? 
  and to think about the scotus nominations ... 
  we should start a `` marriage proposals '' exchange tread, 
  western europe have dealt with russia since the 16th century . 
  also in treviso : [ fontana ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/3c/30/44/fontana-delle-tette.jpg ) delle [ tette ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/2d/5c/7c/fontana-delle-tette.jpg ),

  [ roman bridge ] ( http://2.citynews-trevisotoday.stgy.ovh/~media/horizontal-mid/10728020141313/ponte-romano-conegliano-2.jpg ),

  [ asiago ] ( http://www.veneto.eu/resource/resolver?resourceid=20f70a95-dbb2-4d40-9d3b-caf08ee7b008/asiago-dop ), 
  berlusconi was electrd by the people as member of the parliament not as prime minister . 
  then was nominated prime minister by the president and confermed with a vote by both chambers . 
  this is what our constitition put in place . 
  do n't listen to this idiot . 
  we have never elected pur prime minister , we are a parliament republic therefore we elect only the parliamen members, 
  well in italy they ca n't have referendum for leaving , they will have to win a majority in the parliament . 
   there will be riots and instability in the country old people screaming nimby is quite normal ... 
  they can vote out the uk from the council ( therefore no more veto power ) and start to pass all the shit uk does n't want and the uk has to accept them . 
  well , he called it . 
  and unlimited seasons of downton abbey .

   would it mean that post-wwii reconstruction was a mistake and the americans should have just did to their enemies what rome did to carthage ? 
  which was their first plan : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allied_plans_for_german_industry_after_world_war_ii https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_report_on_germany https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morgenthau_plan,
