and politecnico di torino in engineering . 
  are n't there any constitutional warranties about this ? 
  edit : found this : https://es.wikisource.org/wiki/constituci%c3%b3n_espa%c3%b1ola_de_1978:_03  art\u00edculo 20 . 
  lol i was mostly confused by the fact that you actually quoted me :p anyway thanks for giving me an anecdote to lmao to , and for showing me that i 'm not the only one welcoming them ( been feeling very alone on this lately ... ), 
   after all the crap immigrants go through you want to throw the military at them ? 
  did i say i want to throw the military at them ???? 
  no , i did n't and i do n't want to . 
  are you replying to the comment you wanted to reply to ? 
   i am glad you are not a law maker so am i. 
   no matter how much you cry and bark on here the immigrants will always seek a better place to live not crying and not barking . 
  i just said immigration is not a problem . 
  did that sound racist ? 
  sounds all the opposite to me . 
   i , for one , welcome them and wish them the best . 
  me too . 
  i 'm happy after all the hunger and war they can find here a place to live peacefully . 
  that 's why i do n't want them to be accused of things they have n't done , i do n't want them to be called names and i do n't want them excluded from education , health and jobs . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3goymt/delete_the_mega_thread/cu064hn did i ever said i do n't want them to come ? 
  no , i did n't . 
  i think you 're either misinterpreting my comments , or ... 
  i do n't know what to think . 
  thanks for calling me extremely stupid . 
  now i refuse to debunk the rest even though i have sources . 
  go talk to the mirror . 
   sure , that 's why it was voted the biggest problem in europe ... 
  so the fact that it was * voted * a problem makes it a real problem . 
  nice way of reasoning . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/argumentum_ad_populum  what right to they have to education and health in our countries ? 
  they have contributed absolutely nothing to our standard of living , yet want to profit from it for free . 
  the same that i had when i was a kid and did n't have a job nor payed any taxes . 
   immigration is the biggest problem europe has ever faced no . 
  it 's not even a problem . 
   needs to be talked about . 
  talk about it ? 
  accuse innocent people with stereotype-based unverified claims ? 
  call them names ? 
  insist on denying access to education , health and jobs ? 
  mods please do something about it ... yeah something like a megathread you can keep your eyes on . 
  i never said they 're the only ones , 
   p.s. 
  once you finished with your corruption , could you come here too ? 
  most of our politicians would be scared shitless if this happened . 
  now [ this ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=65&amp;c=ro&amp;l=en ) is what i call impressive . 
  i had been noticing this a few years ago , and i 'm glad to see i 'm not the only one who appreciates them . 
  they 've been hit hard by the 2009-2010 crisis , but luckily they are recovering . 
  still an important mention , the average growth rate they kept in the 2004-2008 period is higher than the german miracle of the '50s , the italian boom of the '60s and the spanish rise of the '90s . 
  in the past 15 years their gdp has more than tripled . 
  it 's not the same . 
  at the times you could conquer milan and venice but still trade with florence and genoa who would n't say a word . 
  there was n't a common customs policy . 
  today if you offend , say , poland , then you lose access to the german , french , italian , spanish markets and so on . 
  this is more or less the same reasoning that most italian intellectuals did in the mid xix century . 
  and unity did make us stronger . 
  you do n't seem to be aware of the big difference that the euro has made in the financial market . 
  in the past 15 years , how many people have bought homes benefiting from reduced interest rates ? 
  how many businesses have made investments and got into debts at low interest rates ? 
  how much would they be affected if interest rates rose back to pre-euro levels ? 
  has grillo calculated this ? 
  c'mon , he does n't even know it 'd have an impact ... 
  estonia can into nordic . 
  not very clear from the picture but ... is that a train door and a diagram of the stations ? 
  i mean , are they taking this thing in the metro ? 
  these blokes have made their choice . 
  let me guess : china !, 
  my former neighbors used to fry fish every day . 
  since they could n't stand the smell in their apartment , they used to open the door to let air circulate ... and this way it got into the building 's corridor . 
  i know your pain . 
  luckily i do n't live there anymore , but now the new tenant most likely will report them to the authorities . 
  and they deserve jail imo . 
  i mentioned the onion because it 's funny , italy has a long standing fame of using a lot of garlic in the kitchen ( though we are almost the exact opposite today ) . 
  would post this to / r/nottheonion if it were in english :p, 
  english translation restaurants without a chimney , neighbors constantly in the kitchen : after the court of last resort ruling on the olfactory disruption in condominiums there is growing protest for bad odors . 
  a million cases every year between neighbors taken to the court . 
  do you love spicy food , garlic , strong scents and passion for pots and pans gets you from dawn to dusk ? 
  be careful because , without knowing it , you might find yourself committing a crime and having to pay damages to your neighbors who are exasperated by your culinary skills . 
  in recent days , in fact , the court of last resort through the 14467/2017 ruling has condemned for the first time a family for `` olfactory disruptions '' , framed in new offense to `` throw dangerous things . '', 
  a ruling comes after continuous protests by inhabitants of a building in monfalcone for emission of fumes , odors and loud noises from the kitchen of an apartment on the ground floor . 
  edit : vocabulary, 
  that makes more sense . 
  there are soooo many italians living abroad and it 's still less than the germans , english and dutch ? 
  i thought the eu 's official position was strongly against backdoors ... https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5i5md4/european_security_agency_comes_out_strongly/ wtf is in the minds of these folks ? 
  the result is predictable like the winter : hackers ( and dishonest europol employees ) will steal all your nude pics , but terrorism is not going to be prevented nor stopped . 
  uhm ... bosnia ? 
  that 's just the spirit rising into the heavens . 
  [ the body is underwater ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/62cedv/europe_is_beautiful/ ) . 
  rip uk . 
  we 're pessimistic by our very own nature . 
  we 're even [ worse than the french ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5gfaez/what_the_world_worries_about_country_comparison/das5wkf/?context=3 ) from that point of view . 
  i 'm pretty sure the italian media will never say a word . 
  so we 've decreased our debt-to-gdp ratio by 2.8 % . 
  not bad at all . 
  what does the italian media say about this ? 
  have n't seen a single article about it : - /, 
  they even distribute back to nl ;p, 
  this is actually scary . 
  he might come to the eu . 
  somebody please convince him that america is great . 
  if they stay in the eu , get out of the pound sterling and need a currency to use ... this might technically be the euro in great britain . 
  ( at least a part of it ), 
   what could go wrong ?
