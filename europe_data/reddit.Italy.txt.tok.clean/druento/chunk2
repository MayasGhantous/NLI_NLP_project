  `` nothing , of course . '', 
  * smiles to the cameras . 
  moves the red stripe from the dutch flag to the bottom . 
  time for you to get a flag with a cross . 
  yes , science does mistakes and scientific sources can be questioned , but not like that . 
  you must either provide more authoritative sources , or write them yourself with ** substantial ** evidence . 
  those authors did look at police reports and official incarceration rates . 
   apply their conclusion to situation they most likely are not fit by occam 's razor , you should give enough good reasons to think it can not be applied . 
  your argument is like saying `` physics were tested on earth , they wo n't work on mars '' . 
  again , you need ** reputable ** sources for that , not just speculation . 
  when the current situation , in which minority is majority in prisons and unemployment . 
  that argument has been brought up continuously by racists for over 100 years and it 's been debunked a million times . 
  i wo n't waste my precious time explaining it , google it , though the explanation is quite obvious . 
   unable to read at face value you 're underestimating my ability to read and comprehend a text ? 
   you yourself are unable to read at face value did you include the word `` yourself '' ? 
  are you saying that to me ? 
  that 's a personal attack . 
  sorry , i have to block your replies from my inbox after you 've said this . 
  ( remember that using multiple accounts to circumvent restrictions is against reddit rules ) . 
  i said that just because i wanted to see you questioning a scientific source without any more authoritative sources , just speculation . 
  if science did not convince you then nothing can , but by doing that you did convince me that populism = superstition ( more than i already was ) . 
   oh i 'm well aware that by mocking you the debate wo n't really progress then you should avoid it . 
  it only triggers ( negatively ) emotional responses which do n't really help . 
   just as comparing trains to politics has little power convincing anyone . 
  you did n't get the point . 
  * a populist politician took a superstitious political position regarding trains . 
  * just like grillo 's party did by taking the vaccines thing to the ministry of health and the chemtrails thing to the ministry of agriculture . 
  the point was that populists are superstitious . 
   and in regards to protectionist policies asking this to me is useless because , as i said , i 'm no economist . 
  but i 've read a million articles saying that banning them wo n't improve our economy . 
  have you tried / r/askeconomics as suggested ? 
   in regards to crime rates increasing citing a tabloid . 
  yeah there are a million newspaper articles also in italy saying the same thing , but scientific sources say the opposite . 
  http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0049089x05000104  after controlling for a host of demographic and economic characteristics , we find that immigration does not increase crime rates , and some aspects of immigration lessen crime in metropolitan areas . 
  https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-abstract/56/3/447/1707591/exploring-the-connection-between-immigration-and  historical and contemporary research finds that at the individual level , immigrants are not more inclined to commit crime than the native born . 
   findings support the argument that immigration lowers violent crime rates, 
   first you argument that they wo n't deliver , did i ? 
  no , i did n't . 
  i only said they do what people want to hear but not what they want to achieve . 
  that 's equivalent to saying that they do what they promised but it does n't work . 
   oh and so because orange is colored like orange trump is fascist ? 
  did i say that ? 
  no , i did n't . 
  that way of discussing is not gon na take us anywhere . 
  i was actually comparing the trains thing to immigration . 
   please explain how her approach would n't work . 
  trump and le pen promise to keep immigrants out and that gives people the illusion that they will have more jobs , better salaries and lower crime rates . 
  actually the protectionist approach has already been shown to cripple the economy ( 1930 's ) . 
  that 's how people 's jobs are lost , already existing salaries may be protected by law from decreasing but the very few offers for new jobs are low , so that 's how an average salary decreases , and crime rate rises whenever the economy is doing bad . 
  i 'm not the right person to explain the details on how economy is crippled because i 'm not an economist , but you can try / r/askeconomics / . 
  from [ a thread in that subreddit ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/askeconomics/comments/5p5lpe/is_there_even_one_economist_in_here_that_thinks/ ) :  there 's literally not a single member of the panel who thinks trump 's plan will help middle class americans . 
  this is basically as unanimous as you get in economics . 
  and that 's how trump 's plan wo n't work . 
  even worse : she will do what she promised , but it wo n't work . 
  just like opposing high speed trains wo n't save our lives because there is no danger in the first place . 
  i never thought about that as a system , just as a poll . 
  it 'd be interesting to see how a country works with a negative voting system . 
  `` anyone but this candidate '' . 
  ( did n't say good to live in . 
  just interesting to see . ), 
  he stands for whatever polls say it 's popular at the moment . 
  he changes positions faster than the speed of light . 
  he 's a threat to democracy imo because of the way he manages the party : whoever dares to question him is kicked out . 
  it 's not a defined ideology , things are `` right '' or `` wrong '' just because he says so . 
  interesting read : `` hitler , the germans and the final solution '' by ian kershaw . 
  one of the things he analyzes is the capability of a political movement to reproduce itself . 
  for instance , after stalin 's death , comunism in russia went on and the regime was basically the same because there was a defined ideology behind it . 
  but nazism did not go on without hitler and fascism did not go on without mussolini . 
  reasoning by this logic , m5s ( grillo 's party ) would be nothing if there were no grillo . 
  it is a bad thing because populists do what people want to hear , but not what they want to achieve . 
  so they end up governing by myths and supersitions . 
  example : in susa valley , close to turin , they are digging a tunnel in the alps for high speed trains . 
  people believe that radioactive asbestos will be thrown into the atmosphere and kill us all . 
  studies have shown this is not the case . 
  turin 's mayor , a member of grillo 's party , is opposing high speed trains . 
  good , it means she 's likely to lose in the second round . 
  kudos for france 's ballottage system . 
  when populism rises to this level , polls should not only be asking `` who will you vote '' but also `` who would you never ever ever vote '' . 
  people like le pen , wilders , hofer and grillo would be much higher in the second . 
  t 's ok , canada will become a member state sooner or later . 
  shhh ... ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ the ^ ^ guy ^ ^ who ^ ^ actually ^ ^ does n't ^ ^ have ^ ^ a ^ ^ facebook ^ ^ profile . 
   i 'm afraid we are destined to see our privacy shrink ever more . 
  a big problem under this point of view is that disagreeing with the privacy policy of companies basically cuts you off every online service . 
  thus we 're forced to accept unacceptable conditions . 
  under directive 95/46/ec , organizations have to request your consent in order to collect , store and use your data . 
  if they want to disclose it to third parties , it requires a separate specific consent . 
  and another separate consent to export your data to non-eu countries that do n't guarantee the same privacy conditions as the eu . 
  in the us your data belongs to the organizations that have it and they can do whatever they want with it . 
  our governments may not care much , but the laws are there . 
  under the privacy shield , the us are considered as eu-equivalent so your data can be exported there without special consent , but most europeans are not happy about this ( nsa , fisa , etc ) . 
  i agree that improving the deals with the us should be the priority right now . 
  i know a few brits who 've been working in italy for a while . 
  not long ago they said in whatsapp groups :  having a long and difficult day at work . 
  go for coffee , there 's no fresh coffee so i use instant ( for the first time in years ) . 
  as i make it it smells like meat or something . 
  i drink it and it makes me feel sick as well as tired . 
  fuck you italy and france for making me appreciate good coffee . 
   literally took one sip and i felt ill . 
  i tried a second and it made me gag a little .
