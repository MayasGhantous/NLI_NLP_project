  seeing it in these terms , i would have totally chosen national interests like coal . 
  [ a showerthought  it 's funny to compare this to italy 's second war of independence . 
  piedmont had an alliance with france against the austrian empire , which was occupying most of northern italy . 
  but the agreement was merely defensive , it would have only been valid in case of an austrian offensive . 
  what did we do ? 
  mob the austrians until we were `` attacked '' . 
  in fact most men in napoleon iii 's court advised him against acting . 
  had the austrians done a similar thing , italy 's role in wwi would have been totally different . 
  you 've made very interesting comments in this thread . 
  would you mind expanding a couple of points ? 
   ww1 was the last struggle of the old aristocracy to remain relevant in an increasingly industralized world . 
  it is often said that the xx century as historians conceive it started in 1919 because of all the transformations of the economical structure of society . 
  is that what your quote means ? 
   i think this is the main reason italy started ww2 so poorly prepared . 
  hitler had the power to shape up germany , mussolini did not . 
  i remember having read about this . 
  mussolini had agreed with hitler that the war would have started in 1942 . 
  but on 1939 hitler was ready ( and willing ) to invade poland , and dropped the facts about wwi on the face of the italian minister of foreign affairs , which kinda forced him to agree immediately . 
  then he returned to rome and talked to mussolini about this , they agreed that they had no choice but to join germany in the early attack . 
  are you saying that , even if he had been given time until 1942 to get ready , italy would still have been unprepared ? 
  many companies had already announced that they 'd move their headquarters to continental europe . 
  theresa may promised to lower the corporate tax to prevent that from happening . 
  i 've seen some articles saying the uk will become a fiscal haven . 
  if it really happens it 'll suck for everyone . 
  i 'm mostly worried because of the north-south difference . 
  as an italian atheist it kinda makes me cringe . 
  but that 's how they really see us . 
  i had read about the testicles thing before . 
  this is where the modern terms `` testify '' and `` testimony '' come from . 
  funny that today in italy touching our balls has assumed the opposite meaning , we touch them when someone talks about a disease or a disgrace and we do n't want it to happen . 
  btw please keep posting these things , i love them . 
  ok , no doubt it was him . 
  him alone ? 
  the evidence against him was his id found in the truck , right ? 
  not much the police can do when someone opens fire against them , he had to be shot . 
  my concern is that the dead do n't talk , so the police ca n't know if he planned/did this alone , or find any links to a terrorist cell/network . 
  anecdotes are not more valid than speculation . 
  awkward is not the same as right winger ( or non-left winger generally speaking ) . 
  and the stereotype of the awkward engineer is subject to [ confirmation bias ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confirmation_bias ) . 
  do you have any statistics at hand or are you just speculating ? 
  am engineer . 
  am left winger . 
  you should probably also mention that the minister of education was caught : she had pretended to have a university degree , actually she only completed high school . 
  she claims that her experience in managing the labor union can help her in her in managing the ministry . 
  edit : adding source ( in italian ) . 
  sorry for this late comment but i was interested in the part about caligula . 
  is it possible that the horse-consul thing was just a metaphor targeted a human consul by comparing his intelligence to that of an animal ? 
  and we modern silly people are taking it literally ... ? 
  can we take a deep breath now ? 
  ... what do you mean not yet ?

  that 's still a lot of visibility . 
  the past few days in turin , when i looked out of the window in the office and i could only see pure whiteness . 
  which in turn is an adaptation of schiller 's ode to joy . 
   america without guns kek, 
   matteo renzi 's economic reforms have been insignificant , apart from a smallish labour reform package . 
  seriously m8 ? 
  `` smallish labour reform '' ? 
  that was the most controversial law i 've seen in my short existence !, 
  itt : people arguing that willing to have `` fewer moroccans '' is n't necessarily racist . 
  several comments are asking for a source . 
  it 's not needed because , as op pointed out , he did n't say `` illegal immigrants '' , `` students '' , `` temporary workers '' - he referred to a * nationality * instead . 
  that 's xenophobia ** by definition ** . 
  you may insist on the difference between xenophobia and racism , but that 's totally irrelevant because neither can be tolerated . 
  ibt chose a somewhat misleading title . 
  of course this is a great step in this area of research , but we 're still decades away . 
  the * magnetic field * has the expected shape and it has been measured with unprecedented accuracy . 
  but it 's not * operating * yet , and :  the stellarator is still not capable enough to generate more energy that it needs to run -- and is unlikely to become more efficient anytime soon, 
  i got 3 remarks : 1 ) the disparities between northern and southern italy are quite evident here . 
  i had read that the per-capita gdp in the north is significantly higher than the eu average ... ... but higher than the netherlands ? 
  sounds too good to be true . 
  something wrong with the data ? 
  2 ) germany had serious troubles after the reunification , and unemployment rose to 20 % . 
  they gradually reduced it and now they 're at 4 % . 
  but the disparities between the east and west are still visible . 
  wtf ? 
  3 ) baltic states are doing visibly better than other former soviet union members . 
  thumbs up . 
  in fact , i believe large metropolitan areas like london , paris or milan would be much lighter if the cost of housing were taken into account . 
   that would n't be if you were n't in the euro . 
  this is exactly what i doubt . 
  i have very good reasons to think that without the euro , the international crisis would have hit us ** much harder ** than it actually did . 
  why do i think that ? 
  because of the benefit that industries got from the low interest rates . 
   sure , interest rates are low that 's what happens in a recession . 
  in our case it 's not because of the recession . 
  in 2007 it was n't a recession and still they were much lower . 
  it is because the euro is much more stable than the lira . 
  we 're definitely not stupid . 
  right now i 'm buying a home and getting a mortgage with 2.6 % interest rate . 
  you may argue these small numbers are a temporary thing due to the ecb 's monetary policy , but in 2006/2007 it never got higher than 5.5 % . 
  before the euro it was 14 % if you were lucky , 20 % if you were not . 
  for the same loan amount and same duration the monthly payment would be more than twice as high . 
  this also means a lot for industries that need to borrow to carry on their investments , which in turn means a lot for jobs and salaries . 
  in fact there was a perceivable decrease in unemployment in the first few years of the euro . 
  when the crisis exploded it grew a lot , but now it 's decreasing again . 
  interest rates also mean a lot for a state that has a big public debt . 
   its the leadership who decides and `` betrays '' the interests of the base and people . 
  your view is correct , but what i meant is that he treats party members as betrayers ( and kicks them away ) just because they have their own ideas . 
   no one can simply `` own '' a party .
