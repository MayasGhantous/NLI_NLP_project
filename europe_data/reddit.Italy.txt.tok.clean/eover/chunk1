seems like it grows more where the sun shines the most, 
  i prefer the lack of faces of dead people too . 
  as if the greatness of a nation was made of seven artists , scientists or politicians . 
  the monuments instead are ok , imho, 
  very nice , and colorful, 
  on italian euro coins the arts theme is carried on . 
  edit : nice thoughs anyway, 
  consider that perception and real intentions are two different topics . 
  i personally think it should be absolutely and only decided by brits with a referendum-like vote - yes or no - . 
  eu should n't let uk do whatever it wants in various topics . 
  ( imho ), 
  please try your best to stop ukip from pushing uk against ue . 
  i got the ita flair here , but i would really identify myself as a member of a united europe . 
  but stop a moment and think about it : most of all those italians coming back in a couple years , a social impulse to italian job market . 
  too much offer , lowering incomes . 
  so the government should lower the pension age to help a turnover . 
  if it all works good , it would put the ok guys on the top places : meritocracy combined with generational shuffle . 
  it could work . 
  ok , but that cited racist usage is more applied in the usa than in europe . 
  damn , [ things like this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxmvpxqgtse ) have never * happened in europe , not for racist reasons . 
  ( and that is not the only case ), 
   look who 's b ** l ** ack edit : sorry, 
   it 's the same in the us no , it 's only in the us, 
  the square coliseum 's really good . 
  fun fact is almost no tourists visit the eur area in rome , which is very comfortable and nicer than the centre , for example , to romans . 
  and / r/italy, 
  it does n't really matter , as bomb warheads are propelled now , gravity does n't really play a role anymore . 
  they have got a 380 to 600 kilometres range . 
  it does n't really matter if these airplanes were n't flying over any eu or nato country as the kh-20 - possibly nuclear - missile that these planes could carry has got a [ 380 to 600 kilometres operational range ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kh-20 ) . 
  airspaces should mean something . 
  if violed , and , after intimidation , not leaved , those and any other airplanes would have been fired down , imho . 
  spain can paella, 
  penna means pen in italian , 
  where would latin and esperanto be on the map ? 
  ( would latin be linked to families other than romance one ? ), 
  ( would esperanto be linked to all of them ? ), 
   the term is nowadays currently used for every kind of segregation segregation ? 
  not letting in without-ticket people , who on porpouse worsen a public service ? 
  ( also , roma people usually do n't pay any tax , and are often helped with welfare benefits )  due to ethnic prejudices . 
  well , due to a state-of-the-fact situation in a small town , created by some well known residents in that one roma camp . 
  although , i agree with others in saying the best solution would be put an officer onboard . 
   `` apartheid not linked to racial prejudices but rather illegal behaviour . '', 
  actually , the term is used in linking this event to the well known racist-based bus story of past usa ; gramellini is a journalist , he wanted to create this kind of sensationalism . 
  i honestly think that public domain datas must be made public to the 40 % of italy 's ( elder ) population which do not have internet accessibility . 
  though this is a politic pretext . 
  it 's truely another level of disgust, 
  ** and my axe !, 
  yeee , first in something !, 
  . . ouch, 
  or go east ... 
  old british humor, 
  what 's the logic of having more than 500 ? 
  where is love ? 
  [ pizza al gorgonzola ] ( http://www.pizzeriaitalia1234.de/bildersk/pizzagorgonzola.jpg ), 
  it would be 50 % + -10 % . 
  the peast was spred everywhere by european armies ' soldiers . 
  it 's known . 
  here we are again . 
  the italian one is soccer centered . 
  ironic . 
  in italy , i think you are counted as unemployed if you are registered as it at the employment agency . 
  this makes all the students and the `` off the books '' work inglobed in the statistics . 
  and a lot of sudents are registered for occasional recluement opportunities , and a lot of off the books in italy . 
  may i ask you where - sector and place - to find a job ? 
  i 'm studying math , i am able to program in c , c++ , and java . 
  languages : italian and english . 
  i bet this is caused by coffee machines efficiency , maybe . 
  can anyone post a typical finnish coffe and explain how it is done please ? 
  italian home-made coffe is usually done with [ these ] ( http://caffeamodomio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/bialetti-moka-express-1-kopje.jpg ) and it 's neither a real espresso nor [ this ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ize6p3612xw/ty_yhhazwgi/aaaaaaaaaeq/rw5zhkbix9s/s1600/cd84b7b330055d0ec18115e28b83b74a.jpg ) long . 
  yes, 
  italy was well aware of the immigrant crisis , years before europe woke up . 
  too many times europe turned away from italy 's problems . 
  italy is a net contributor to eu project , really dissatisfied of its investment . 
  eu often does n't understand italian priorities . 
  and that 's all . 
  they do n't row against nor the same way . 
  edit : italy was pushing for immigrant quotas before this summer crisis . 
  it did n't arrive to european medias untill too late . 
  well , so did august for dracma, 
  yeah , same energy sources,

  [ italian cheesy reply [ nsfw ] ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqp7wxunm5g ), 
  you know , many but not enough, 
  yes they are projections . 
  but there was a main change in italian public debt 's politic : programmed reduction , as he showed you in that image . 
  that graphic also says that without italian help to eu , imf stability programs and greece mess ( and russian cuts ) , italy would have remained in 120 % range ... 
  so , if international market do n't speculate too much , helped by ecb pspp , it 's not going to sink the boat . 
  you make me sad ... like ... who says debt must be re-paid ? 
  luxury toaster right here btw , our public debt is mostly kept by citizens , 60 % ish, 
  i think we have payed enough for greece 's too high life style * reg\u00e0 ci si becca a ferragosto a santorini *, 
  at least try, 
  italy should imho do : - continue saving lifes from the illegal trafficking , fight criminals - make identification centers work in time - not letting anybody spread accross the country or europe - repatriate non refugies , or imprison them until they cooperate for rempatrying : italy should show it is a closed door for african economic migrants . 
  europe should do : - pay equally for it, 
  not really , for me . 
  but stereotypes have a true face . 
  my principal difficulties were false friends , pronounciation misunderstanding and frasal verbs . 
  italy approved the sanctions . 
  italy lost billions in those sanctions . 
  if russia attacks , italy is called to intervene under nato pact , the only serious deterrent betwen a russian baltic republics , poland and whathnot . 
  italy gives this for free to eastern eu .
