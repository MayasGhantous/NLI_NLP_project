  3 hours exactly, 
  til the l rule has ancient origins, 
  color correction master we got here, 
  are there good beaches nearly ? 
  the methodology is written below the map . 
  either they are approximating given some secondary data , therefore the anomaly , or it is confirmed nights in b & b and hotels . 
  36 % of italians travelling once a year is bullshit . 
  lol , the data set does not include travels to property second houses . 
  that are majority of italian travels . 
  if [ that roman expedition ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_teutoburg_forest ) did n't fail , everything in history would have been different . 
  i went there top season and the city is so big it 's not overcrowded , everything is efficient . 
  it is efficient thanks to taxes on sales . 
  less people , less money , less taxes . 
  and i know tourism cities . 
  yes , the lorry weighted 108 tons ; we have that video because the flagged cracks were being evaluated that day , although the street was not closed yet . 
  the prices of existing hotels ' rooms would go up . 
  it benefits hotels . 
  but less tourists does not benefit the city . 
  the bridge was raised to be ~ ~ repaired ~ ~ raised , the temporary structure failed . 
  last time the bridge was flagged but an authorization for a huge weight special trasport was given . 
  it has been a human error both times . 
  carry some data to claim something next time . 
   still have n't managed to get the a3 sorted out completed two monts ago . 
  english press , i know . 
  active italian users are way less than 1200 anyway . 
  [ google ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=french+absinthe+drinkers&amp;client=ms-android-lge&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=518&amp;prmd=isvn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewin6u3k2ansahwkprokhdnlbswq_auibygb ), 
  we have had it in italy too . 
  rex was better , though . 
  i think she will loose first one , and win 51-49 % the second , 
  that 's a reference to those french absinthe drinkers paints, 
  yeah , apparently she reconquered rome 's territories ; gallia next / s, 
  where did i deny it was the standard practise ? 
  wages werelinked to it . 
   inauspicious this is what i said . 
  life was better in that system . 
  that 's what matters . 
  italy surpassed great britain power in that system . 
  i 'm actively pro european advancements , but euro is a mistake for italian people ; you are just blaming italy for things you do n't know , like 99 % of foreigners always do . 
  it makes me boil my blood . 
  it keeps my connationals irate more and more about you `` friendly allies '' . 
  this shitty stereotypically inaccurate blaming behaviour leads to nationalisms and wars , just study hystory after you completed euro effects on italian youth chapter . 
  it seems to me that you are talking out of your ass with your inauspicious perpetual devaluation hypothesis , history contradicts your words . 
  the fixed currency has had a terrible effect to italy , it is a fact . 
  now , you can say italy might not exit the eurozone , and i would agree with you , depending on what are my interests , either in capital saving or wage improvements . 
  the refinancement of the public debt in non-exchangeable currency bonds is still in process , therefore there are not `` real costs '' apart from marginal up to 30 % devaluation of lira to euro and consequent inflation but 0 % unemployment , +20 % workforce ( that in theory create a big economic growth , counteracting inflation ) . 
  phoenix checks out, 
  a fact is a fact that does not imply anything per s\u00e9 . 
  a statistical study has shown that italy could put in work 7-10 % more people to align with the european average . 
  if this could be made possible , italians would have a gdp increase of 2 % for ten years . 
  facts . 
  political interests have created the current under employment rates . 
  the simple factor nobody ever considers , 10 million italians tomorrow [ could simply start working .

  ml 5,3 - 5,6 - 5,4 between 10,30 and 11,30 cet . 
  centered in the appennini mountains between lazio and abruzzo , lightly felt in rome . 
   in the ocean of many other similar cases that have already determined a sociopolitical question . 
  no , they could have done nothing . 
  the blame would have gone to who autorized the profit making business in the location . 
  3000 euro a month to pay a way out of criticism is a joke . 
  nobody is really hungry in rome because mense already exist . 
  i think that ` italian trains ' is like a meme in netherlands . 
  our old and new trains are really good actually . 
  italy and france , in addition to have been the moral and factual creators of the eu , they have been very optimistic for long decades . 
  what in the last ten years has happened and european missing answers have made us change our opinion . 
  it 's a binary choice . 
  the fact is that 1000 burgers a week is a pr marketing bullshit . 
  people rightfully are even more angry at their arrogance in wasting the city 's beauty or class while pretending they are doing something good . 
  the problem , as always , is not the single episode , but the moral precedent it establishes ( the vatican agreeing with it ) in the ocean of many other similar cases that have already determined a sociopolitical question . 
  yeah , an index that in 6 hours and with 0 upvotes reddit link has changed . 
  rostrum, 
  i found italy ^ top ^ center, 
  do you really care more that a new politician chose badly people to work with , people who already worked for ages in the positions , or that last administrations left the actual state of things ? 
  you are carrying in rome because media want you to . 
  you have to understand this . 
  ( what is this if not propaganda ? ), 
  falling in the rabbit 's hole : 1 . the christmass tree was adjusted : shitty press job . 
  2 . the lies have been invented by the propaganda . 
  incoherencies , yes . 
  nothing illegal . 
  such lies would not change things like the other parties have done in the complete shadow in the past , orders of magnitude worse : shitty press job . 
  3 . rampant corruption : are you talking about last administrations ? 
  mafia capitale and even all the other scandals facts happened years ago . 
  no shit there is corruption . 
  who has to fight it , he should do it everynow . 
  but the strumentalization is evident : shitty press job . 
  i live in rome , and i know shit very well , romans did and do . 
  if romans would vote again for another party other than pd or pdl , would you believe the media are reporting post truth shit ? 
  i tell you they would . 
  no , just watch tonight 's public main station tg1 to realize who you are defending, 
  you have n't seen italian media in the last months , or even today , to say this . 
  media political propaganda anti m5s in the country has reached laughable proportions .
