  let 's the germans take the clocks , the frech the food , they need it , and us the banks , given that money is already ours . 
  the point is , everybody feels european , but nobody wants `` others '' to administrate his interests . 
  states stamp money . 
  you also have n't studied history very well . 
  ... keep ignoring penal code, 
   and so ? 
  does this make him less of a criminal ? 
  this phrase shows you lack law knowledge . 
  you already sentenced him before judicial process . 
  even if he was found guilty in the end , he had perfect curriculum for the role . 
  whoever would have the mayor chosen would have been called in a trial . 
   yes ours are criminals but yours are too first , you are ignoring reality , the condition conventional politics has carried things untill today . 
  second , penal responsability is personal , you ignorant . 
  m5s rejects whoever is found guilty . 
  other parties have let people stay on their chairs . 
  i 'm no grillino , for the record . 
  when an economy is doomed a nation has no choice than make a war . 
  fuck this logic , nobody wants a war . 
  if peace with russia is re gained , everybody is safe . 
  your mother moans , italy asks principles not to be trashed . 
  italy has put effort in the european project for 50 years . 
  italy has made germany united again possible , eastern europe has never lived so well thanks to italy too . 
  that is not truth and italians are not stupid , you might be asserting this . 
  american imperialism ? 
  i do n't like most of them and their ideas , but the other three parties make me vomit . 
  the other three parties have carried us down here where we are . 
  the two people who are under investigations are two top administrative workers , the crimes were or were not committed under previous political guidance . 
  this comes after half of the past administration has been incriminated in what has been called mafia capitale , before this new mayor plebiscitary election by romans . 
  the fact that is contested to marra , which was already in a high position in the administration of the capitolino hill , has happened 3 years ago . 
  the same politicians that created the power strains that carried the city to the actual state , they are now incoherently criticizing the new government not being able to destroy the connections with the past . 
  again , it 's a political battle in which the accusation bases are foggy .

  you can watch [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/7rgwks2uawy ), 
  yes . 
  people think in absolute integer numbers all the time . 
  from the other year , it 's 1 ) private boats that have to answer if emergency is called and they are near 2 ) international ngo boats that [ literally ferry ] ( https://youtu.be/7rgwks2uawy ) between the two coasts 3 ) trident assigned european navies ' boats that go rescue these people 12 miles from lybia . 
  italy has nothing to do with this massive immigration , other countries have , no immigrant want to rest in italy . 
  it 's curious as the latest west european countries that decriminalized it , then legalized gay marriages first . 
   other types of ** partershit ** neologisms, 
  italy was one of the firsts to decriminalize homosexuality , though . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/4yu50c/decriminalization_of_homosexuality_in_europe/ ) ... therefore , is the rest of europe , apart from france and poland , lazy ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  italy has never been bailed out . 
  italy was a bigger economy than the uk . 
  currently it is the third in the euro area . 
  it is a net contributor to the union . 
  that 's the simplicistic version . 
  it 's debatable as the pact was a defensive one and austria attacked serbia knowing the war would have become continental . 
  before the start , though , both berlin and wien knew italy had no sufficient food and relyed on british commerce to sustain the population , that it would have not taken their part in it . 
  some times after the beginning , turmoils carried us in , nationalistic interests prevaled . 
  the alps front war was won by the italians , as if austria would n't have signed the armistice , the army would have marched towards defenseless wien . 
  because our grandfathers won a war to secure the borders in the alps . 
  there are two ways between to choose : either solve italy 's problems or italy will solve them itself . 
  italeave is not a matter of if , but when . 
  have a grand tour, 
  context is that in italy many businesses born because government decided to pay 35 euro , per day per head , to bed and feed immigrants . 
  pocket money has been 2,50 all this time . 
  many reports showed shady practices in these contracts . 
  it 's no news nor scandal many private ships have been rescuing wreckages off or in lybian waters for years . 
  whatever government will result from next political election , they are going to resolve things first . 
  it 's impossible to submit a euro exit without crisis in the short period . 
  though many studies confirm italy might be better off without it in the long term . 
  higher than the 5 days average now, 
  such as healthcare ; transports ; utilieties ; infrastructures in general ; streets themselves ; factories ; ports ; refineries or extractions ; everything ? 
  there will be abuses and untill then the government will be able to change your next to home natural reserve in a mine with the excuse `` it 's for national interests '' . 
  50 million people win over 10 everytime , right ? 
  - no , since 9th vote , 50 % +1 votes decide the pdr . 
  also , the corte cost . 
  will be direct representation of the first party . 
  - the powers given to the national government over the regional ones will mean many abuses . 
  - the fear is that given the vote nobody will be able to touch the new text , and many political scientists think it wo n't be changed untill a major scandal . 
  - all the fears on sales and \u00e9lite privileges are motivated by history . 
  - it appears you have read only partial propaganda or you have well read the changes and not been able to understand consequences . 
  in practice : - election of corte costituzionale and presidente della rep. 
  thanks to a always-changeable electoral law . 
  these two organs will be emanation of the first party , not of the first coalition . 
  always . 
  a party that takes control will be able to rest there forever thanks to our propaganda situation . 
  - the government will be able to sell everything it wants to multinationals , concede to create , yes , but to be slave . 
  - more powerful governance = less workers ' rights and more banks ' interests . 
  are you going to be ok with this in exchange of 1 % gdp growth ? 
  - wo n't be able to re modify the contitution in theory everything is good for stability , then you realize parties do n't work for people 's needs since forever . 
  this is the most scary bill of my life , in theory , obviously , facts wo n't express themselves in the short term . 
  anyway he will be forced to . 
  the great question is if a technical government will take place or not in 2017 . 
   how to say this gently ...  here 's a report from the [ italian national institute of statistics ] ( http://www.istat.it/it/files/2016/07/fattori-di-rischio_salute_def.pdf?title=fattori+di+rischio+per+la+salute++-+26%2flug%2f2016+-+testo+integrale.pdf ) with data collected in 2015 , which states that 9.8 % of people older than 18 are obese . 
   ** edit : ** i also found the [ swiss federal statistics office 's obesity report ] ( http://www4.ti.ch/fileadmin/dss/dsp/upvs/pdf/indicatori/comportamenti/obesita.pdf ) from 2012 regarding ticino , which reports 9.7 % of adults as obese ( page 3 ) , far from who 's 19.3 % . 
   imho this map is made up . 
  credit to u/davidebaldini, 
  none of the 1800000 italians around the world who voted has been ever polled . 
  the debate has risen as a bigger percentage of foreigners has voted than average , after `` yes '' campaign sent a advertisement letter utilizing a ministerial * but reserved list of addresses . 
  exactly . 
  then , who should be elected , someone who goes against majority 's interests ? 
   improved economic situation the one 3 years of renzi 's governance have offered ? 
  please . 
  do you know the numbers of italy 's lack of work ? 
  do you know that italy has been declining from 6th world economy to a place where the avg wage is so low people ca n't sustain themselves ?
