  are you kidding me ? 
  renzi divided italians to remain in power . 
  this constitutional reform will not be managed to be modified for 30 years keeping political caste in their armchairs keep doing elite 's interests . 
  please stop here . 
  you called `` again '' a democratic process a `` populist revolt '' . 
  you are again setting `` what would be better '' which rests a relative concept , in terms of different interests . 
  in yesterday 's [ la7 piazzapulita 's opening ] ( http://www.la7.it/piazzapulita/rivedila7/piazzapulita-lascia-o-raddoppia-puntata-01122016-02-12-2016-199501 ) , the m5s leading exponent summarized up their positions and plans . 
  i do n't know how to express this concept in english , they are inherently populist in the sense that they are the only party in italy representing the common people at the moment . 
  ( edit : not demagogist , property of all italian parties ) these fear mongerings resemble same fears that ( media ) accompained trumps victory or brexit vote . 
   pure luck respected security procedures, 
  if there 's a accountable person for this , it 's renzi 's `` i will resign '' . 
  therefore you are citing just another plus of voting no , from a protester 's perspective . 
  if you are comparing a democratically elected m5s governance to arab springs , then you are out of your mind . 
  the funds should be equally distributed, 
  it 's not like the prime minister has the presidente della repubblica 's power to call elections . 
  renzi might not resign , that 's how far he can push . 
  there is very little market for 25 mq apartments in italy and other countries because of `` staying at home longer '' when young and sigle . 
  and economic reasons , eg lower median wages than other states . 
  therefore lower rents . 
  the picture would be different in 60mq 's case . 
  hug of death, 
  yes , economically speaking , either lower the profits or compensate with `` national pride '' sales . 
  in today 's cars and tech manufacturing , automatization has already taken most of the work anyway . 
  it does n't seem a wise investment unless factory work would be paid way less than european counterparts , or automatization would take most of the job . 
  i would n't worry too much , in close future living outside urban areas will be seriously more appreciated . 
  the problem of this reform is that it does n't reform for the better in any way . 
  it does not address none of these problems singularly , not changing in any way for the better . 
  it 's vague , and meantime complicated , because it 's written badly and because to face any of these questions there will be needed specific laws . 
  changing this way means nothing to me , and i 'm sure it will carry bad things for my country in the short and long time . 
  you can disagree on this , but on 4th of december i vote on the reform , not for next parliament . 
  the constitution reform does not give back to the parliament the capability to make laws against today 's problem that is that laws are made by the government . 
  less deputies , in part chosen more locally , will ease mafiaish corruption of them . 
  costs reduction could take place in other forms , they simply voted no to that multiple times . 
  many public services that nowadays do work well and do not press on public balance anymore will be given back to the state , that with lack of coordination will for sure worsen them . 
  moreover it wo n't be possible to spend less consistently , same personnel will work , only conditions and practices would become harder . 
  the reforms italy demands are others , for example it should shock fellow europeans that civil justice simply does not work anymore in less than 8 years . 
  in addition to this , renzi himself has shipwrecked his career , the no will win to make him go home . 
  but around what percentile of wage goes into taxes in spain ? 
  rome is shit to daily live in . 
  bad public transports and traffic/chaos . 
  high cost of life , and general inefficiencies , compared to italian cities average . 
  beautiful environment in free time though . 
  imho of an outsider , only the queen can stop it at this point . 
  i can see what populists there are in italian politics , though no major party is anti-eu . 
  italy can fall into a anti euro currency for rational reasons next year , but no plan has been made yet . 
  great ski slopes, 
  yes , but it 's not like that outside top touristic center and season . 
  it probably remains one of the most beautiful cities in the world to visit if you do n't go in summer . 
  it 's full of art . 
  but it literally stays afloat with that income , because otherwise , withouth maintenance , palaces would collapse . 
  therefore this statistics is stupid, 
  well , our politicians do their best to make rich way richer while normal people get poor and do nothing , what outcome would you expect ? 
  i would read a good article about this theme , detailed with well researched wide economic figures . 
  this explains the nine non-euro countries . 
  even if it was * just * french , spaniards and italians , it would be a concern . 
  off course i do n't know 180 million people . 
  in italy every word from germany is called a berlin diktat . 
  you are the one who can not see . 
  do n't believe me then . 
  i do n't know . 
  i 'm certainly no international politics expert , but i 'm sure a big part of europe wo n't trust germany 's proposals until the political layout has changed into something not seen as a unwanted dictator anymore . 
  absolutely , i meant germans should change in order to get better paneuropean relationships, 
  let 's see what happens up to january , though europeans do n't like merkel , germany should change imo . 
  he created this uncertainty when he said exactly these words some months ago . 
  sea ? 
  the title is a false statement, 
  in the lead years many people died for terrorism . 
  being recognizable in public is a principle that every italian agrees and identifies on . 
  the person in question was asked to leave or to show the face . 
  she refused , therefore law was applied as it would have been applied to anyone . 
  same with italy , and the name is even spelled wrong, 
  time for porsche to pay for that abomination, 
  they call it tax holland, 
  there 's a 1:250 ( costantine time ) model made under mussolini , now stored in the roman civilization museum in the eur district , that you can virtually visit [ here ] ( https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/collection/museo-della-civilta-romana?projectid=art-project ) . 
  [ pic ] ( http://imgur.com/zxkjg3j.jpg ) , [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2notkd/awesome_model_of_ancient_rome/?ref=search_posts ) . 
  that map shows the vastity and modernity of the ethernal city , unparalleled for a millennium , but to appreciate the importance of all the structures present , you should follow a good guided tour . 
  anyway , [ video ] ( http://vimeo.com/32038695 ) . 
  it seems like you do n't know that there is a step between normal pasteurized and uht , which is microfiltration . 
  it tastes like the normal one , and it must be refrigerated , but it lasts a lot longer , 15 days . 
  yeah , but it 's two methods to manage the same thing . 
  or are houses going down and being rebuilt in germany ? 
  they are not , the property is owned by fewer people than it is in other countries , where `` the family '' is the centre of the society , instead of the individual . 
  i know first handedly the downsides of this , but generally rents are really low now and many think there could be a house bubble popping sometime soon . 
  it 's not going to happen , because the population really believes in putting the money into property . 
  therefore they spend less and economy is shit . 
  but still, 
  i know, 
  in reality average ** wealth ** of italians is much higher than german , because of distributed accumulated property value . 
  it 's the ** product ** that is higher there . 
  except black market, 
  schr\u00f6dinger military, 
  no , some sources like the annual study on drugs to the parliament shows a 32 % have tried it . 
  op 's source says 29.3 . 
  sincerity appreciated, 
  mostly normal people who also regularly consume and give it to friends for special price . 
  but a big part ends into street sales , which is almost totally composed by immigrants . 
  op try to get more shades into next map ; an example : italy has 29.3 , while france has 30.6 , and denmark 36.5 . 
  quite misleading . 
  then propose a alternative to tap water that does not make it worse . 
  i never drank bottled , and i 'm sure it 's psychological for the most part , but somewhere it is needed .
