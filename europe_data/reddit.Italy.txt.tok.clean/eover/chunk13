  i was saying that just because it is good for you , it may seem odd , but tastes really bad for others . 
  and by the way , waters in worst italian places usually are a lot better than other tap waters in europe , by far . 
  fyi , todays no roman call it any of that, 
  lemonated water is shit to italian taste , just fyi . 
  now we need a math_distance map edit : i mean this : | x-y |, 
  there 's a big hypocrisy around these showings of openness . 
  many of those countries that today are progressive , untill two decades ago were really oppressive . 
  while there are countries that still have n't made the step but have being progressive by habit or neutral by law since hundred years . 
  i 'm strongly angry with mine , that reached a compromise but could n't fully commit into * current year * . 
  but i laugh at this rights showing , reached with thousands of castrations or years of prison untill the years i was born , in specific other countries .

  [ stelvio pass ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/stelvio_pass ) , the second highest paved in the alps at 2757 meters above sea , famous for summer skiing , bike racing tappa at the giro d'italia , wonderful road to drive .

  nazism includes many other ideologies other than the concepts of nationalism and socialism . 
  you should ask more context to excerpt if he refers to that past political party . 
  a national socialist he declared to be does n't make him a nazist per s\u00e9 . 
  his political view does n't deny him the confrontation ability on a economic question either . 
  his personal ideology is far from being worse than 17 billion euros stolen from a nation . 
  that is not the worst part . 
  the italian government garanteed full cover to some titles arbitrarily . 
  it turns out that many big investors are not going to loose that much , while the taxpayers offer ~ ~ champagne ~ ~ prosecco . 
  this is hilarious , terrific, 
  like , drone a usb key onboard and wait, 
  if they 're going to nationalise the failings , they should nationalise the banks . 
  lenght contest, 
  as far as tourist traps go, 
  not cervino , though, 
  those big banks steal from everybody to give to the rich, 
  i 'm just objectively analyzing . 
  there 's a big difference between 100 % rate and less of a dozen a year in the whole country 's fights . 
  there are lecit jobs more dangerous . 
  interesting point . 
  though , one could argue mafia organization could be compared to a state without recognition instead of a ideology . 
  moreover while western states are currently open and active about fighting terrorism , italy is not de facto doing so with its problem . 
  therefore , what i wanted to say from the start , is that joining a organization that could only carry advantages is not the same of joining a ideology that wants you to die for it .

  italian coast guard was doing search and rescue under specific rules of engagement . 
  as european triton , frontex mission is doing right now . 
  it 's the ngos that await smugglers 18 km from the coast . 
  if it was the case , i bet other countries that were fucked once would search revenge by making from this a political countermove . 
  top 3 eu capitals and why ? 
  no doubt nato would bomb the shit out of any mobilization on nato soil , even using nukes . 
  a counter strategic attack is unlikely because nobody wants a full scale , ergo to die himself . 
  the bluff would be over . 
  on the other hand , nato could never leave a single own country to be taken . 
  so nothing of the above will ever happen . 
  there 's better wars to be fought . 
  . . name 's on point, 
  no , church 's proprieties on italian soil do not retain the same status as the vatican . 
  they fall under special jurisdiction , you find everything in the patti lateranensi and following reviews, 
  should n't we remember from history classes that self-determination denial is a major cause of what led to ww2 ? 
  catalan people has the right to fight for their freedom as much as spain has the right to fight back . 
  that carries to war . 
  you like gilfs ? 
  as if cinemas will ever be the same as before, 
  the rich or the people ? 
  45k + 10/20k irregular soldiers for italian page, 
  damn , i get to know of a fire i can see from my window on r/europe before than in person . 
  the wind blows in the opposite direction , i guess . 
  edit : it 's a junkyard near battistini metroa station ; fyi , do n't get accomodation there if you come visiting rome . 
  richs becoming richer at the expense of middle class , accusing immigrants, 
  that 's called azzurro , not blue , in italian , this is why these people did n't understand, 
  [ we do n't like small statues ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/parco_di_pratolino%2c_appennino_del_giambologna_01.jpg ), 
  i personally prefer that to a crying kid . 
  source ? 
  i would like to see the total number of cars pro capite ( p.s. 
  i do n't understand why other languages use the formula `` per capita '' , while the latin form is `` pro capite '' because it is used in the singular form ), 
  it 's treason , then, 
   central italy 75 % aeneid by virgil confirmed, 
  got ta know the physics to prepare for when shit hits the fan, 
  hopefully this hits the mass media and gets stopped . 
  this witch hunt is bullshit , partially : a order of magnitude higher number of cases is caused by old diesels still circulating and by unregulated wood , pellet and coal burning in domestic/urban stoves . 
  ah , the old good e ^ -1 = 36,8 %, 
  it 's complex , but firstly i see paris/rest of france conflict symbolism skyrocketing here . 
  short circuit, 
  did you know venice is building a multi billion dam against 3 metres tides ? 
  well rome is similar on some days of december . 
  i believe we have more wind most days than paris , but less rain . 
  moreover , it sucks they stop all 4 years old cars , while most of the toxic particles are made by stupidly-not-banned pellet stoves and hawayan-set heating systems . 
  i know for sure italians are going for greece in august, 
  you hear me , legal accusations in vote campaign are boomerangs, 
  what do you think european arms should do about the red spots ? 
  a ) nothing b ) pay local businesses for infrastructure c ) make jobs for european services d ) else, 
  if you do n't understand it then you are the stupid, 
  today 's pools ca n't predict what will politically happen in these 14 days . 
  they are surveying what people would vote today . 
  i doubt it . 
  the * common men 's patriot * novella will have a chance , wo n't go as reported by today 's pools , close 50-50 . 
  rationally , fillon 's votes will go to lepen , as much as country citizens wo n't vote for macron . 
  as much as leftists ones . 
  i would like to know your opinion on which of nations ' banknotes and coins were more ** artisticly ** appreciated in the past , what do you think about them now and how 's the euro in comparison . 
  here some ( feel free to add the others in comments ) : - [ french franc ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_franc ) - [ italian lira ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_lira ) - [ english pound ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pound_sterling ) - [ deutsche mark ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsche_mark ) - [ czech koruna ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_koruna ) - [ spanish peseta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peseta ) - [ irish pound ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_pound ) - [ polish zloty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_z%c5%82oty ) - [ greek drachma ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_drachma ) - [ euro ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euro ), 
  english throughout , spanish in the middle school , though many choose french , little choose german . 
  latin , but it is a separate thing . 
  trenitalia.com you should be able there to check the trains avaiable . 
  imho it 's a long trip . 
  moreover , unless it rains a lot , lake bracciano is quite in a drought atm . 
  on the summer beaches and in the gyms, 
  0 untill i want them .
