  if italy could redirect that 1 % of gdp istantly , it could afford to build a lot of missing things . 
  btw , you know , our economy is stagnant since 1990s . 
   this is going to make things politically interesting in italy lmao !, 
  there is a choice to make . 
  this invasion could carry italy xor ue to different scenarios : - ue intervenes : concentration camps . 
  ghettos at best . 
  problem under control . 
  ue common plan to resist and face the problem in civil manners ( not done in recent years ) . 
  - problem not solved : high corruption , high crime rates , black work , exploitation , social problems , racism rise etc. 
  welfare et similia extra costs . 
  fascists elected . 
  more civil constrast . 
  consequences : italy abandons ue and ez and goes back to sovereignty . 
  declares war to unrecognized lybia 's governments , sinks those `` warships '' . 
  - mix of above . 
  main eu problem : - if italy is left alone with this mess , it will choose the second path , i assure you , italians ' anger unite as nothing else . 
  in my opinion , he has already chosen . 
  greece people chose him to choose . 
  european states has already given greece money impossible to be payable back . 
  greece has to exit eurozone at this point . 
  young generations are and will be the most unfortunate ones . 
  but as history tells , second war generation is the one that carried europe up where it is . 
  do you know what you are talking about ? 
  so much false information . 
  italy 's economic train ended with the euro . 
  before , it could use devaluation as a powerful weapon . 
  italy did not receive helps with the debt crisis . 
  it 's probably the country that has lost the most with the single currency . 
  i think that two lemons , some legumes and three potatoes a week can save his life without beeing expensive, 
  said that , there 's plenty of 30.000 $ cars , but people got poorer , so majority of car models are cheap . 
  an audi a3 is 25.000 $ , i think it 's considered a good quality-durable car, 
  there 's a range , i 'd say 10-15 k $ is low end , 15-20 k $ middle , 20-25k $ is ok for a familiar or good quality , 25k $ + is considered upper class, 
  italian middle-class cars are 15k $ - ish, 
  stupid feet-made laws , political guilt . 
  seen with todays eyes , pensioners owe trillions to tomorrow workers , mainly accumuled by public debt , less taxes payed , less contributes given , low pension maturation years , higher than payed services taken , tl ; dr wrong math done in the past . 
  in general , what 's the point in accusing this politic maneuver at this point ? 
  if this is non costitutional , then italy 's in bankruptcy because noone is willing to raise taxes to communism levels . 
  fuck the in-law-corrupt-system . 
  to give a lecture key , future pensions are calculated to be half today ones , at least more equally distributed . 
  ^ italians ^ are ^ evenly ^ ^ fucked, 
  actually , for a large part of unemployed people , italy is not giving unemployed benefits , neither actual assistance in jobs finding , as said previously by quirite . 
  the first is comprehensible , the second 's a shame .

  they also profit by their children , i do n't like that . 
  collectivity gives them everything to live , and they make crimes noone ever pays for .

  a big italian company has started changing common plan to include a 2 euro fee/day if you use anything from another country . 
  a bail out policy , which will make them earn a lot , which is a theft , probably a fraud , and eventually something will be fined .

  though , not beeing born yesterday , we know many things already . 
  first of all who will benefit of it and who will loose rights . 
  who has already shaped the outcomes . 
  that parts of the agreement will be shady as fuck . 
  that political propaganda will direct votes . 
  that europe as a whole will benefit much less than north america , economically speaking , just comparing the market dimentions , the workforce/cost difference and other matters and factors . 
  the immense power big businesses will have over governments in unfair tribunals . 
  it would have meant german and french for the most , and partly dutch , italian , and spanish banks to default too . 
  either that or the governements should have saved them . 
  they opted for saving them through the lovely greek drama show , various billions were spent to save europe , not greece , which now can leave with a big middle finger raised to its youth . 
  that crown has a jesus christ cross nail in it , was held by costantine , first roman christian emperor , was the crown of the holy roman empire for centuries , and later the crown of the reign of italy . 
  it 's not just some work of metallurgy . 
  also , europe is full of equally beautiful medieval bibles and codexes . 
  btw , it 's not a competition . 
  ireland can have sweet dreams tonight . 
   medieval europe 's greatest treasure ? 
   no , for me edit : spelling,
