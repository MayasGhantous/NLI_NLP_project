  well , we love you too < 3, 
  fuck you too macedonia , as when i was a child i could n't tell the difference between a country and a fruit salad . 
   the italians granted permission for the drones to be used only defensively , to protect u.s. special-operations horses in libya , the officials said . 
  is the point, 
  no , but polish thunder sounds epic, 
   grom its the name of an ice cream franchise in italy, 
   second best food item ever made after pizza , right ? 
  yeah , maybe bread, 
  never found that key, 
  ctrl, 
  \u00c0 noobs, 
   when tested with a warm engine . 
  no shit , sherlock . 
  / s anyway , the article does n't say which engine is under investigation , i presume it 's the 1.3 multijet ii 95cv , one of the best diesel engines in europe , also very little . 
  which is tuned for euro 6 omologation . 
  so , do or do not make good pollution tests , but do n't complain if the car behave differently in other kind of tests . 
  also , how important is it if a new car does not respect these low standards , if out there there are millions of cars and veicles more polluting ? 
  * shadow queen * sounds better, 
  we do eat [ these bigne ' ] ( http://imalbum.aufeminin.com/album/d20090302/389259_z5oowsslwume1dxaujss7y8fzyaghy_bign-di-san-giuseppe-j_h084150_l.jpg ) too . 
  thanks , sorry for specific terms and inaccuracy , just wanted to give an idea . 
  i was referring especially to the last case : recapitalization of banks . 
  something that many states did some years ago , if i recall correctly , an economical statal gift . 
  neither italy use that instrument , nor italy did ask or receive enormous borrowings from bce at agevoled interest rate . 
  anyway , new laws were made recently , on top of which the bail-in of currentists over 100k $ for banks passivities . 
  italian banks use to register the passivities not as frequently as in other systems , so they now had to write off all the insolvencies . 
  some banks failed . 
  so italian government wanted to let these private banks to create a bad bank , something that could be possible a year ago , and was used countless times eveywhere . 
  no , italy can not . 
  at the end , after a month of diplomacy , and i ca n't imagine what blackmailing under the table , europe has given an ok . take this case , multiply for ten times a year since at least 2008 . 
  i do think it 's media 's fault for dramatization of political debates , anyway european union does not work for italy at the moment . 
  major cases i can remember are : north and south stream case ; eurobond ; russia sanctions ; intervention in libya by france , uk , usa to move aside italian influence ; immigration ; flexibility on every front ; allies support on speculation on italian debt ; its the same story everytime singular interests come before italian ones , everybody take them . 
  italians do not support anymore this thief 's attitude . 
  problems carry other problems , the recession could have been surpassed in a year ; more cooperation , and better friends choosing methods are the keys . 
  well , he made some real points , differently from the article . 
  everything can be fixed with adequate effort . 
  though one must ask himself if it 's easier to build something new instead . 
  although gdp is going towards +1,6 % this year , italian economy has not recovered its pre crisis wealth level . 
  workers rights and banks ethics have raised more concerns recently . 
  even if unemployment is at 11 something , its the young unemployment at 45 % which i fear . 
  government seems to be spineless on serious concerns . 
  most attentions last years were given to funds , state companies , richness taxation , but nothing , nothing has been done to this front . 
  young generations are literally depressed by future perspectives . 
  no work , no emancipation from own family , even when married , no kids as government does not incentives that too , no pensions . 
  possible default as international speculators attack italian firms and public debt renovation is behind the corner , finally . 
  italy 's spleet on civil rights too . 
  at the moment the law going through parliament is going to introduce the `` civil unions '' beside marriage . 
  child adoptions for gay couples are far from being introduced , even the stepchild adoption , which would circumnavigate this point , as surrogacy is available in foreign countries . 
  foreign policy has always been dealt badly . 
  most interests are now on libya , for eni profits . 
  finally , italy 's sentiment towards europe is negative with a negative outlook too . 
  continuous double standards and senseless pedantic authority have left a sign on italian dream of a united europe . 
  i 'd say this is mostly true , but : in sports centers ' changing rooms , nudity is accepted , and it is really ignored , both ways , both genders ' ones , distinctly . 
  at seaside , a lot of women uncover the tits to sunbath uniformly . 
  it 's also accepted , and i think not against laws , if not locally ; although , complete nudity is not accepted out of special beaches . 
  also , unfortunatelly it 's never the beautiful youngs , among whom there 's more pudity . 
  projected films and meetings between authorities followed in 29-30/01 / 2016 . 
  what if i dont want to be poisoned ? 
  allegedly , this is not science nor research, 
  therefore either you were from where mafia rules or you are in bad faith, 
  me neither , center . 
  also i think this thing anglosphere calls corruption ( these threads ) is not the corruption i consider present here , applicable to most of italy . 
  the corruption i hate is the bribe to earn many public money as payment for a shitty work private businesses pay . 
  and i admit this shit happens a lot , as the only explaination to facts . 
  then there 's the mafias , another world . 
  it 's a bluff , sienna does n't exist, 
  it is doing it now , after 10 years of german dictatorship on the matter . 
  now that , not doing so , italy would have gone bankrupt . 
  are you blind or condescending ? 
  after 6 years since the crisis in other states, 
  we too, 
  you are right , though you 'll agree most people who live in not southern urban zones have left dialects behind . 
  so , generally talking half italians do not know a dialect . 
  i dont know , most of countryside still speak them . 
  elder people speak them . 
  and most of small cities speak them too . 
  but most people live in cities , or has left family , there every dialect is already dead . 
  apart from italian , - everyone can speak it - elder people know the dialects ; new generations do not so much , even if the cadence in their speak is strong , in most cases , in fact it 's easy to deteminate the macroregion of origin of someone listening to his italian . 
  instead , given some exception , it is difficult to understand something of a dialect speech , even within the same region . 
  this really varies from * understanding the meaning * to * some words * to * nothing * . 
  for comparison , it is to me easier to understand spanish than southern or nortern dialects , i 'm roman btw .

  * i know , totally joking there . 
  although usa still performs this militar imperialism for economical and political influence reasons . 
  nato has terminated its birth accomplishments . 
  it would have been time for something else since 25 years ago . 
  diplomacy , especially when concernig russia , should outscore bellic warnings and blackmailings et similia . 
  something more useful to both continents could be established instead . 
  * invading, 
  not today, 
  remainder, 
  this would increase disparities inside europe . 
  also , will it be good for the people of cheap labour nations or western europe ? 
  and ho good will it be for small and medium-sized businesses ? 
  italy ~ ~ stronk ~ ~ high, 
  this is very right , though not complete : as we get to know foreign realities we criticize them too . 
  we are very keen to criticism ...
