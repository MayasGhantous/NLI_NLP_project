  idiots ' mother 's always pregnant ... 
  implying oil is exchanged in pounds, 
  yesterday i saw a mother gypsy with two little children of hers walking on the emergency lane of a motorway, 
  apparently [ plastic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polypropylene ) thanks to [ giulio natta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giulio_natta ), 
  ... and your shitty cheap condoms, 
  due to technical problems italian economic miracle has been shut down . 
  we apologise for the wait . 
  use your free time to go walking outside , contemplating sunny mountains . 
  it will eventually restart back soon . 
  my old friend ... 
  `` 3 migrants and 1 polar bear walk into a bar ... the barman promptly take the gun and shoots thrice '' ; `` how rude !, 
  '' , `` cruent ... '' , `` so much violence '' , `` monster ! '' . 
  `` see !? 
  nobody cares of the migrants ! '', 
   italy and strategic thinking do n't really go together i quitely disagree on this ; i find italy to come out of any crisis winning its chances . 
  i think italy just used the `` we were a great power '' jolly , here . 
  these foreign affairs ' minister words are basically meaningless at the moment , he just wanted to reunite the bigs of europe on top priority eu problems , without other member disagreement words . 
  it 's not unknown that east countries do not accept migrant compromises , uk warfare thematics , nordic russian policy . 
  the topic is clear : eu future politics . 
  and the key is a central block leader on the matters in order to do relevant actions as a whole organism . 
   gallo translates to cock in english , fyi, 
   sweetbread strictly regional, 
  we use butter too !, 
  money ai n't it all, 
  instead of spending 4 months in prison ? 
  yes ? 
  i bet on albania admission to the eu for christmas, 
  actually , recently they changed their mind into exit euro only . 
  italian constitution prohibits referendums on international treaties . 
  and it 's more than uncertain they will a ) get elected b ) exit something . 
  the euro . 
  italy has lost the most in europe from adopting the euro . 
  not entirely euro 's fault , mostly italy 's fault , but fact is some politicians revived the idea italy would do better off the eurozone . 
  now , renzi does n't want to loose the referendum , he should leave in case , therefore he made up agry tones with bruxelles to enfavour electors . 
  my bad , by democratic i meant more proportional , while i intended the party would have a majority through both houses , not only the deputates chamber , which is the central question . 
  also , pools may fail , given yesterday 's example , and undecided may decide for the vote . 
  m5s would make coalitions because they need them , after the vote , therefore they would not change the elctoral law now . 
  these are my opinions . 
  tell me what is false from what i 've written , maybe we 'll discuss those points, 
  italy is difficult to govern because as every government takes its place , it goes full ape mind and gifts capitalistic interests with either procurements or laws . 
  centralization of powers from regions , included in this constitutional reform , will let the state to sell off people 's infrastructure to multinationals . 
  renzi has already made excessive work reforms , wages and rights have been lowering under decence limits . 
  renzi made an electoral reform months ago to give himself power in next government , now that he can not win he wants it to be changed . 
  it 's not true m5s would not receive enough votes through a democratic vote . 
  renzi will try , already has , to call `` stupid '' people who vote for the ** no ** , it did n't work well on america , and it wo n't work here . 
  ** yes ** could win only in case of opposition 's autogoals . 
  you say to choose wisely , but can change be change without a change , though ? 
  political parties either adapt or die , there is no in-between way . 
  requests find representative leaders , it 's natural . 
  after ww2 , europe had to be something , money were spent towards a future . 
  today , it 's simply unacceptable the state of some european states . 
  lack of political effectiveness in pursuing people 's needs . 
  it all goes againt some basic principles , tied in our culture . 
  a father would help the son even if he would have wasted everything . 
  our problems are no distant to american greatness request . 
  make america grain again, 
  i do n't think europe has ever showed to be pussies to anybody, 
  on the other hand , some neighbourhoods in palermo seem come from right out of a war . 
  my opinion is it would have been a weaker pattern , leaning towards hillary in extremes , neutral for the most . 
  the researcher took the major 3 states in europe , missing out the 4th , 5th , 6th for example , and actively chose nordic countries . 
  i wonder if a pattern would have risen if he had chosen top 3 plus italy , spain , poland and benelux instead . 
  the walking debt ^ save ^ us,

  good job op, 
  i play online with maybe overreacting but very rational and friendly russians . 
  meeting with other humans do change your misconceptions on them . 
  internet has made geo-blocked meetings a reality . 
  corrected to 5,9, 
  do you believe majority of your friends would sacrifice trade for less working europeans in the country ? 
  or are `` refugees '' the problem ? 
  of course , english press, 
  at least italians have understandable pronunciation ; ), 
  proficient people usuallly study more in general and find work at home . 
  emigrants are usually less skilled people . 
  calculating by rate . 
  is n't a third of the population quite young ? 
  young italians do reach a good english proficiency level . 
  and a higher number of people than you expect do work using basic english too , in tourism ir in exports . 
  instead , basically every old person except graduates never learned it , just beacause they teached latin and french at their time . 
  34 % seems right to me . 
  they should have been banned in trafficated city centres . 
  therefore banned from busses too , as they constitute a higher risk for people . 
  but a euro 6 diesel emissions are orders of magnitude lower than euro 2 diesels , and cities have been more polluted than today for decades . 
  so it does not make sense to ban euro  4 diesels now imho . 
  better invest in metropolitan clean public transports . 
  it says `` a nation of poets , artists , heroes , saints , thinkers , scientists , sealers , and migrants '' . 
  the building was made under mussolini and it 's a work of art imho . 
  the official name is italian civilization and work building . 
  but romans refer to it as [ squared colosseum ] ( https://www.google.it/search?q=colosseo+quadrato&amp;client=ms-android-lge&amp;prmd=minv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj-of7gue7pahveuhqkhzpscn4q_auiccgc&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=518&amp;dpr=4 ) . 
  gran fuga, 
  in r/italy there are two kind of communists, 
  i read it [ here ] ( http://www.jeeprenegadeforum.com/forum/33-engines-discussion/6009-engine-1-4-multiair2.html#/topics/6009?_k=8zrg9u ) !, 
  ( search for netherlands ) people like trolling , i suppose . 
  it 's because the moment they strike they get fired, 
  is it true you ca n't drive 4x4 vehicles in netherland ? 
  and was never bailed out, 
  they should n't be able to expell any european even without residency, 
  i remember our class doing this 20 years ago . 
  toilet paper and soap are the only things that have always been missing . 
  they , respectively , will be forced to stand aside at one moment .
