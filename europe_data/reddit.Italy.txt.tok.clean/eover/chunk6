  sure !, 
  you are in italy , in rome , near oranges ' garden , you can look through that door that hides a palace with garden from malta 's knights order , then you see the san peter basilica dome , the vatican . 
  and in between there 's still italy . 
  [ really ] ( http://i.imgur.com/avmb6rk.jpg ) , [ good ] ( http://pelagios.org/maps/greco-roman/ ) [ engineers ] ( https://www.google.it/maps/place/fiumicino+rm/@41.7817899,12.266045,14z/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x1325f8688f0ce393:0x4094f9ab23a7e50 ), 
  you can look at three different states from [ this lock in rome ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/9ojy1yrjvb/?taken-at=402382692\\ ) ), 
  for who ? 
  conflict of interests live personification . 
  wow , you just have to start an activity in italy then, 
  [ s\u00ec ] ( https://youtu.be/jf-wiwpkdxi ), 
  it 's a thermostatic valve . 
  it closes the hot water coming in the unit when a temperature of the air is reached . 
  like : 1 = 10c 3 = 17c 4 = 20c 5 = 22c you have to find the general thermostat to activate the system though , or to do it manually at the boiler , otherwise those valves do nothing . 
  you are a cunt, 
  you can have it if you really want to - disney, 
  why would you want canned food if you have a year wide supply of everything ? 
  hope they are scarse , because india is going to use them soon . 
  which is cheaper ? 
   international spotlight do you think italy or rome need the olympics for this ? 
  because i imagine you could make a touristic propaganda for decades in the whole world with 10 billion euro , creating work , you know , what our republic is not ensuring . 
  or just a 10 billion mess, 
  successful in everything but economically . 
  in the same way it would have been in rome . 
  you have to admit and accept something before you can learn and grow better, 
  great leaders have the habit of hosting olympic games, 
  the malfunctioning system is peculiar to the whole peninsula , though in rome it has reached unbelievable levels , but everyday life keeps going . 
   what makes the city so difficult to manage ? 
  [ even with a debt of 12 billion ] ( http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2016-04-06/roma-debito-pregresso-quota-12-miliardi-064018.shtml?uuid=acldy01c ) , city services are scarce at best . 
  lack of money is the cause of all . 
  but why are money missing ? 
  money have always been mismanaged , obviously . 
  how ? 
  some think of lack of competence , some think of mafiaish procurements . 
  occam razor . 
  trasparency has always lacked , it 's not even been a appliable concept on the matter for people untill today . 
  balances have always been hidden . 
  last mayor , who was getting improvements on the corruption layers , was kicked off by his own party , the pd , the national government 's one . 
  he openly said the reasons behind . 
  m5s has been elected by a enormous majority pointing to trasparency and operatization of the system ; in 3 months it has been attacked by all the parties and there has not been a day rome 's question was n't on [ national news on the media ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/4fmewv/2016_world_press_freedom_index_1581x969/ ) . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** money and corruption, 
  let 's start , you get us watches , deal ? 
   but the problem has grown so bad that early this summer , videos circulated of children playing by counting the dozens of rats surrounding roman garbage bins . 
  although it 's unacceptable , that the problem has grown is an invention of the politicized media . 
  i 'm roman and rome had way worse garbage problems before last differentiation program in the last fove years . 
  also , i remember of rats around my school , years ago and that was no problem at all for administration apparently . 
  rome 's announced disaster , in many imaginary ways is a media construct . 
  he 's obviously worried by the illegal immigrants situation, 
  it is eu 's choice because we all think that uk would prefer to get other privileges and remain in at this point . 
  the majority of the emissions is caused by old cars and trucks . 
  the solution would be to ban those . 
  you do n't know shit about italian university system . 
  are you even italian ? 
  taxes for public universities , which is the norm for everyone except some privileged , are between 2500 and 3000 euro a year . 
  if your family income is certified low enough , your taxes are lowered too . 
  extremely low incomes receive free money bag too for books and accomodation . 
  usually a room in a flat is between 200 and 400 euro a month , depending on the city and location . 
  even though teachers competence is highly respected , the system is harsh , really disincetive people from completing . 
  we have a ~ 50 % abandon rate as a result . 
  if you read the study , then you 'll find they did n't make the worst engines as euro5 standard . 
  ( though in the article that image is taken ... ) . 
  though , i believe for a cost-benefit reason , they have not implemented a fine-of-the-art apf system . 
  so , in real life conditions , even if their cars are able to pass the euro6 tests , to garantee longevity to their systems , at some circumstances the fluids circumvent the system , therefore being more dirty , relatively . 
  because we all know that a bigger engine makes bigger exaust volume , right ? 
  or have we forgotten that ? 
  just remember that there is no union . 
  then you will see it is not the union that bends , but yourself . 
  yeah , blue in florence , milan and north east would have crushed with the agenda, 
  of course those are righteous points . 
  given that policy , though , eu then should deny access to the common market to multinationals based in a country that has a lower than average corporate taxation . 
  problem solved . 
  media are objectively against her in the way as `` macchina del fango '' is cited in encyclopedias , not since the investigation was released , days ago , but since the start , about themes that were not her governance 's fault , but obviously about pre-existing mafia governed structures . 
  political knots that are unknown to us took place for the resignation en mass . 
  is this index of incompetency ? 
  yes . 
  though , are media insisting this new party to be dirty ? 
  yes . 
  is that a political agenda ? 
  media have a lot of betrayed responsability , though : you can not deny as raggi was elected `` scandalo qua , spazzatura di la ' , stipendio su , raggi gi\u00fa '' was an anthem chored by the media 24h/24 . 
  i also said mafiaish , which is different . 
  i noted the economically incongruent situation that is rome , which is explained by the mafiaish corruption in * appalti * , which is not * en par * anywhere else . 
  you , denying it , make your position hilarious . 
  because of democracy , she does, 
  i 'm from rome and even though i 'm not happy with her management , i 'm happy my money are not going to mafiaish services ' businesses or disappearing now , as it has happened for decades with usual parties ' administrations . 
  rome , the capital , with the highest budget though the worst services in the country . 
  rome has billions in debts too , ( who has created those ? 
  ) , has shitty services for missing funds and pd candidate supported the 2024 olympic candidation , which would have ended with even more debts . 
  now it furtunately will be withdrawed . 
  now , traditional parties have a strong power on media , and since she was elected with a extreme margin , they have pushed for scandals and public sensationalism , because they want to make her fail because of all the mafiaish businesses that would not operate otherwise . 
  edit : lol at the downvotes , people who do n't live here do n't understand why romans voted ** 67 % ** in favour of raggi, 
  you have n't been to rome in a while , have n't you ? 
  we italians mostly shit at home . 
  public restrooms mostly are seen as dirty , useful for emergencies . 
  ilol 'd, 
  thank you for this translation . 
  a very interesting german-view article on international politics . 
  a message for the government : young italians would like to work to earn money . 
  a russian gives , a russian takes,

  i 'm usually against censorship and i would understand the choice against it , although this is bad journalism , earning on a disaster , yelling falsenesses and bad faith opinions , clickbaiting with a offensive title . 
  i feel insulted by this title . 
  who is the guardian to define lax a law code ?
