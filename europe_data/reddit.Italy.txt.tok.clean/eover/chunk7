  this article is voluntarily salty . 
  i ask ~ ~ the mods to remove this thread ~ ~ users to downvote the thread if you think this journalism is shit . 
  firstly , most of collapsed buildings were old . 
  secondly , the collapsed school , public building , had a anti-sismic adjustment some years ago , and collapsed nonetheless . 
  thirdly , the anti sismic criteria are not lax . 
  criminals who do n't respect law are criminals . 
  low employment is our best resource for growth , optimistic point for italy . 
  it 's the english maze : the advantage in manipulating international audience with biased journalism . 
  #spaghetti aglio , olio , peperoncino the italian `` what to eat if you have little time or little energy '' . 
  a * piatto di pasta * that unifies all the * belpaese * . 
  ** ingredients ** - spaghetti ( barilla no. 5 or no. 11 as dimensions , no thinner nor larger ) , 100g each ( 80g if you have a complete second afterwards , even 120g each if hungry ) ; - extra virgin oil ; - garlic ; - powdered chilli ; - grated grana padano or parmiggiano ; ** how to ** - boil some water , add a little handful of salt , less if less water e.g. 
  for 1 person . 
  the pasta must not taste salty at the end , neither must be insipid . 
  better less than too much anyway ; - when boiling put the pasta in ; - in another little pan put around 3 spoons of oil for person ; - peel the garlic , put it in the oil ; the temperature must not rise , let the garlic have a hot bath , and stop it ; - put in some chilli , turn the heat off ; remove the garlic . 
  - after some minutes , around 2/3 of the time written on the box , take a spaghetto and taste if it 's cooked . 
  if not , repeat after a minute , and again . 
  we italians like it * al dente * , meaning at the center of the piece of pasta it 's still not cooked completely , and it keeps its shape when pushed . 
  - drain it , put it in the plates , add the oil and mix it . 
  ( alternatively , mix it all in the pan and then serve it . 
  anyway , you have to hurry up doing this , otherwise it 'll get cold ) . 
  - put grated grana * a piacere * on each plate : #buon appetito !,

  who 's right ? 
  leaver britain european collapse agenda or renzi 's personal giournalists ' propaganda ? 
  i 'm not sure i 'd call zara or geox shoes `` high-end , '' but it is a damning article nonetheless . 
  i do n't think this kind of scandal will affect any of the shoes or brands that are popular , however , because the same practices have been carried for decades in every sector . 
  let 's be serious : renzi has talked of the reasons of the meeting and i 'll try to summarize them here . 
  source : [ repubblica ] ( http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2016/08/21/news/scalfari_renzi_manifesto_europeo_ventotene-146352548/ ) the main abstract topic : spinelli 's project for a united europe under a federation of states . 
  due to ` many things ' this is not a possible way . 
  let 's talk about focal action points : - financial and economics european minister or its alternatives ( more powers to x , to y ) . 
  strong action powers to him/them . 
  - eurobonds . 
  some kind of , debts and credits : eurozone must become the centre of europe , open to any other state of the eu . 
  ( if the trio will be united for this , they may succed into its approvation by the 27 ) . 
  - eu armed forces batallions ' formation . 
  ( possible north african intervention ) . 
  - strong unification of suthern states , between : por , spa , fra , ita , gre . 
  common interest : mediterranean sea policy . 
  - italy 's political problems for renzi with october 's referendum ( and newly approved yet now terrible for pd election law `` italicum '' ) . 
  - - italy 's problem : growth ; renzi and padoan ( ita economy minister ) should have already prepared something but they hesitate . 
  tl ; dr : they want to discuss in advance between them the problems and solutions , before meeting alltogheter with eu members in september . 
  why have n't anybody made a total medals/athletes sent ? 
  yeah , sure . 
  we should connect the two somehow, 
  ... it 's a feature edit : definitely not expecting this , thank you kind stranger !, 
  if you account in that non-occupied people do live somehow , and that quite a lot of transactions are not registered , eg . 
  street markets , therefore not reported , then you can see under the table italian gdp is somewhat big . 
  it has been said that this practice is what made italy stand up with the bigs in the last half century . 
  as i remember , a estimation was added to national accounting in the last years , as other european states already did . 
   the % in this map is relative to the population as a whole , not just the employed one . 
  i understand the arguments behind , but this choice alters comparison , because there is differences of 10 % in ` working people class ' . 
  best time to invest was ten years ago . 
  next best time to invest is today . 
  i 'm in that percentage , i suppose . 
  i would love a more equal taxation that encouraged entrepreneurship and better administration , even better civil law system . 
  political matters that i like to hope will fix themselves with time . 
  though , i 'm generally happy with my country . 
  and i do n't know anybody who would change country if not for necessity ( eg : scientists have a bad time as little public and non-existent private research funds ) . 
  if you consider productivity as money/time and consider italy 's gdp has stagnated in these years , then you can actually make hypothesis , all of which do not imply causation . 
  italy has accumulated wealth . 
  it 's bad distributed though , italian society is family based , parents are more rich . 
  economy has been stagnant practically for 20 years . 
  this means young people do not have enough money ( they will get them when their parents die ) . 
  so my conclusion is , if you are over 40 years old , for all the other reasons , italy 's one of the best places to live . 
  not otherwise . 
  nobody expects spanish inquisition, 
   somebody else allowed the asylum seekers to enter the schengen zone . 
  here 's passing the buck as usual . 
  not single governments nor states 's fault . 
  it 's top ten european politicians in the council 's responsability , as far as european border is european . 
  will time heal this problem too ? 
  if history is written by the winners , you can not argue press and media are written by propaganda . 
  sources are out there , they are opinionists ' hypothesis on reported `` facts '' . 
  dark humor matters, 
  lol , how many italians aged less than 50 have you met in your life ? 
  this statement is pretentious , because the majority of younger italian generations can speak english . 
  black ops, 
  you are right , the only mean other than not let them take the nukes , it 's not to concede turkey to use them . 
  nato may approve a sudden intervention to destroy them . 
  if the madman ever decides to . . 
  you misspelled world, 
   in terms of health , the usa is better than ... what do you mean ? 
  from a guy born in sarajevo, 
  you can either be cooperative or do n't be, 
  zola !!!, 
  you win ( germany ), 
  so snob, 
  shortly , situation is stagnant . 
  but , margins of growth are enourmous in a decade with a change in governance . 
  strictly , italy has the least percentile of people who work . 
  do n't hear all the people and articles claiming the fall , they are brexit propaganda . 
  does it make sense to call italy europe 's next crisis ? 
  looking rationally at the single problem , it does n't . 
  this is already a month-old problem that has already been solved by finance ministers past weeks . 
  the political question is still not closed for reasons , the game is played internally and internationally . 
  all the comments of interested people on these pages are more adequate than mines at factually blaming alarmistic trash . 
  your car gets a flat tire : holy jesus , it 's not a crisis . 
  a fact is worrying though : english language articles have tried to set fire in europe since the failing vote . 
  massive, 
  also , merkel is driving it,
