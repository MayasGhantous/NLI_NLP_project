  verdoon, 
  ... portugal wins, 
  in 2017 italy has obtained a seat at un council, 
  corruption and black market infices the statistics and the public finances , therefore the labour rights and the services , but not the economy . 
  spain accumulated public and private debt in the decade , to nicely face the crisis . 
  it 's now a good time for their growth and the first thing they should think about should be repaying the debt . 
  with mismanagement of this question they could end as my country , blackmailed by big brothers . 
  better than a week ago, 
  it 's not as fucked up as the 42 trillion derivatives in deutsche bank assets portfolio, 
  if they think italians will let to be troikaed they are wrong , i think we would be happier with euro shipwreck and divorce from the common currency . 
  a thing that is not said out loud is that italy sent 80 billion to bail out principally french and german banks from greek fall some years ago . 
  a political precedent for italy ( the third euro economy , and the third net supporter of the eu ) is nothing against a trillion economic crisis . 
  who cares if the b plan is a some type of bail out states kept doing untill 2 years ago . 
  let 's fuck up badly italian public debt , let 's italians pay for it . 
  yes , this is what happened tree years ago , europe kept watching . 
  now that stability was found , let 's create instability with no plan b. italian government is probably going to change before next winter , then we will speak again of pacts that does not carry benefit for italy . 
  this behavior is against european integration , but has europe understood italy has not grown since it joined euro currency ? 
  and it still is now the third power in this europe without common team logic , things are going to change , italy is going to put vetoes very soon . 
  i do n't deny the euro currency referendum to be into the political debate , and the map is right showing it is not , by now , going to happen, 
  a not binding referendum is not provided as an option by this constitution source : article 75 of italian constitution ( ** my accentuation ** ) ** e ` indetto referendum popolare ** [ cfr . 
  art . 
  art . 
  art . 
  art . 
  [ ... ] the referendum is for abrogation of laws or acts that have law value , it is not permitted the referendum for a authorization to ratify an international traty . 
  `` ratify '' meaning is debatable but in the end [ it 's approval ] ( http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/ratifica/ ), 
  a referendum on the matter is prohibited by italian constitution . 
  the political debate is carried by populistic parties at opposition to gain consensus . 
  you can not defend yourself from your inside, 
  the plan for defence of northern italy from ussr , in case of a land attack through trieste , was to bomb the enemy troops and places midway with little atomic tactical bombs , thus placing an artificial obstacle to invasion . 
  just saying, 
  yeah if you forget the chaos he ~ ~ wanted ~ ~ succeded to get in libya, 
  quitaly, 
  spain can not into gevernment atm, 
  though this will be imposed, 
  `` wow that 's one hell of expesive camera which has just broken '' `` 637 billion euros '' `` what '', 
  the new electoral law called italicum was published on the 6th of may 2015 when renzi already was prime minister , he was a promoter of this . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_electoral_law the usual the guardian garbage, 
  better incompetent than corrupt , for me . 
  was marino corrupted ? 
  absolutely not . 
  his people ? 
  absolutely not . 
  was he shot down because of touched economic interests ? 
  yes for sure . 
  giachetti and his people can be good as you want , but they are supported by pd , which means they would reestablish old economical friendships . 
  i 'm pissed of the old waste of money to friends system . 
  and i think many are , so the case will be closed tomorrow and we 'll see in some years . 
  you are confusing topics . 
  this thread is about rome 's mayor , which will be determined in 3 hours between pd or m5s . 
  i obviously was referring to it . 
  i am roman and i now prefer a `` bad '' mayor who would publish economic data ( obscure since the spqr ) to a `` good '' mayor who owes favors to his party which has trashed the city in last three years . 
  if past macroeconomics has teached us something , it 's that things totally change in ten years , for the best or the worst . 
  one big variable we can suppose will count soon is oil price , the other one is brexit or bremain , one other greek future , etc. , ( european soccer results too ), 
  my point was debt to gdp has been stational and since months government can not higher the structural spending , therefore the debt can not be increased by law . 
  i will update with a recent graph , which i was searching for . 
  update : pdf file technical showing comparison on european public debts , https://www.bancaditalia.it/pubblicazioni/finanza-pubblica-ue/2016-finanza-pubblica-ue/suppl_30_16.pdf italian ( public debt ) / gdp history at page 12, 
  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/dept.svg edit : oops , it is old, 
  what can i say ? 
  it 's better to try the unknown rather than vote for mafiaish decennial relationships, 
  this is not true , even though debt/gdp is as high as 132 % , it 's been historically high but it 's now stable since years , since last 2011 global speculation over it , and it 's programmed to lower down , due to a new change in constitution . 
  interest rates have never been so low too , which means the debt `` price '' is lowering year by year . 
  it 's also one of the most self detened public debts , meaning debtors are mostly nationals , and finally private debt rate is one of the lowest in europe , meaning the state could higher taxes to compensate without broking banks . 
  wait , how does this differ from any other party ? 
  the famous pact , contract they invented has been considered unlawful a while ago . 
  the free mandate principle apply to the mayor as a representative of the people , here , therefore no pact should be imposed to a democraticly elected mayor , who could govern for the best as he/she believes . 
  rome is fucked with the m5s because of the pd national government . 
  otherwise m5s has showed good menagement in local administration . 
  rome 's politics have showed so much corrupted that the biggest italian city has probably the worst services inthe country , which is illogical , though it has become `` normality '' for most people . 
  meanwhile msf and other ngos ' boats , with this explicit intention , carry migrants from lybia national waters to italian ports , interfering with political will , increasing the flow and reasing the death count . 
  i 'm just pointing out the variance issue that must be accounted for extrapolating conclusions out of this statistics . 
  good job on the method , though imho you needed more data . 
  have you weighted the values by number of active nationality voters ? 
  does n't the german map look strange ? 
  oh gosh , history should teach . 
  italy is trying hard to appear neutral to the central block just to change side for the best at midpoint . 
  they already have arms, 
  finally the euro tunnel makes sense, 
  we europeans , also / s, 
  obviously we 'll take infrastructure back, 
  before west invades you, 
  they should ban diesels to entry cities , though it 's very stupid to ban them for other uses, 
  are you john snow ? 
  it seems you know very little about italy . 
  did you hear media 's news on italy in berlusconi times ? 
  outer italian media ? 
  it seems the case . 
  the approximation of those pieces of news to reality was embarassing . 
  italian economy is moved by forces as much powerful as in other western countries , even less than those in france , and others . 
  ` statalization ' of corruptness is how i call lobbies methods formly lawful in some countries . 
  the same countries that proudly show dark green in this new study , not based on perception , but still . 
  italian national sport is not soccer : it 's actually self deprecation . 
  this quietly explain itself all the ` statistics ' that should account for that . 
  southern italy is not corrupted in the way westerners think about corruption . 
  it seems like normal italian practices are bad considered abroad , in regards to administration and public security forces in particular . 
  there is no such corruption at the base of the pyramid of things in italy . 
  the only corruption everybody knows it 's there is public competition announcements and public structures favoritisms . 
  i showed you the italian corruption panoramica, 
  so a part of the italian migration compact which has been proposed months ago ? 
  thanks merkel,
