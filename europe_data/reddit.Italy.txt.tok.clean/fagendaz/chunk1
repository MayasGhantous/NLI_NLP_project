it 's an american brand . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.newbalance.com/ ) their site, 
   we 'll have a nice pineapple pizza stand near the pool beware : this is an official declaration of war !, 
  i was commenting the map . 
  but in my country we mainly think of arabs because they are the most diffused muslim minority, 
  we hate muslims , do n't we ? 
  i really like the authenticity of the guy 's surprise when he says `` holy sh * t are you kidding me ?! '', 
  you have an eagle eye :d, 
  i can try to explain you how they work in my own country ( italy ) . 
  here the two houses have the exact same role , but they 're elected by different censi ( you can elect the chamber of deputies since the age of 18 , but have to wait until you 're 25 in order to elect the senate ) . 
  they tend to be part of a democratic counterweight system since every bill has to be approved first by the chamber of deputies , and then by the senate . 
  if the senate rejects the bill , it has to return to the chamber in order to be revised ; this goes on until both chambers express favorable vote by the strict majority of their members ( 50 % + 1 vote ) . 
  we call it , with a total lack of fantasy , * the ping pong between the two chambers * , because sometimes bills go through this process several times . 
  can not give more upvotes, 
  you missed an / s, 
  but they also have long life expectancy : the benefits of a better healthcare system . 
  you win . 
   in italy those views would n't get him far he could always join forza nuova or casapound . 
  omfg , what have you made me discover !, 
  nice point !, 
  i never got to think of those events in that way !, 
  open google type coup press send, 
   and for those who think mussolini gained power because people voted him [ such ignorance in this thread ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/legge_acerbo ), 
   mussolini rised to power with a coup [ ma anche no ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/legge_acerbo ) , my friend , 
   do they want us to be sad that hitler and moussolini lost ? 
  those kind of people mistake the defeat of nazi-fascist r\u00e9gimes for the defeat of the whole nation , so , yeah , they technically want us to be sad . 
   those were n't fun times but trains were departing on time , do n't forget . 
   anything that goes wrong in a capitalist country is the result of individual failure or cronyism , never of the system . 
  this . 
  also , inps !, 
  why do always people forget about inps ? 
  * when he was in charge ... *, 
  my favourite languages are german , catalan and my own which is , you guessed it , italian, 
  abbiategrasso - `` have fat '' ( literal imperative ), 
  mostly methane but old condos still have a centralized gas oil fueled system . 
  you meant * let-ah-me go !, 
  thank you , mate !, 
  omg that 's one of the funniest accents i 've ever heard !!, 
  ( please do n't be offended ), 
  here 's the same , dude !, 
  italians just do n't understand that * the h matters * and i can not point it out without them saying * that 's just a detail *, 
  believe me or not , i was definitely waiting for someone to mention that :d here , take my upvote, 
  i think we have a pretty funny accent too ... when we get to speak at an acceptable level of course, 
   `` wow , they are white people '' are you white ?!, 
  o_o ( / s , of course ), 
  oh , do n't worry : we hate your wine too . 
  technically illegal , but ok if you include the definition `` fascists of the third millennium '' . 
  monday !, 
   maybe after that people will start to care . 
  naaaaa , they 'll continue caring exclusively about soccer . 
  france !, 
  they think they have the best wine , cheese and food ... and we generously let them believe it . 
  switzerland , please . 
  ( although the racism towards us would intensify a lot eheh ), 
  may be obvious for us , but not for our german friend , 
  we have many police enforcements . 
  the main three are polizia di stato ( literally state 's police ) , which responds to the ministry of intern ; arma dei carabinieri , which is a military department and thus responds to the ministry of defense ; local police , which responds to the municipality . 
  omg that was amazing . 
  i would also add veneto . 
   i do n't remember if we study lincoln and slavery . 
  it depends on the professor , although it 's not in the program . 
  left-wing : [ comrade berlinguer ] ( https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/enrico_berlinguer ), 
   give him his finger and he will grab your whole arm . 
  we say the exact same phrase here . 
  the difference is that they * had no choice * in the change of the economic system and its rules ; but we * had many chances * of chosing our leaders and we always ended up with poor choices whose consequences were to , government after government , ruin the welfare system and worsen our public debt while avoiding making public investments at the same time . 
  they switched from assassinations to corrupting public institutions . 
  were i live , in the north , it is common for them to infiltrate ( we literally use this word ) in public contests for the allocation of building contracts . 
   getting rid of the mafia would be a good idea , but no one wants to do it :( ehm ... i think that 's a more complicated problem than you think , fellow citizen . 
  first you should teach people to refuse the mafia logic , it 's first a cultural issue and then an enforcement issue . 
  you ca n't win if you do n't start to reward courage . 
  many people that rebel to the mafia logic are left alone from the state . 
  it 's very improper to reduce the whole problem to * no one wants to do it * . 
   extensive cycling infrastructure i think the whole europe envies your cycling infrastructure !, 
  of course it depends on how much alcohol your body can process . 
  i drink mostly beer outside and wine at home . 
  a night of beers would mean 4 pints , 5 $ per pint = 20 $ . 
  if i wished some cocktails i 'd just drink 2 pints of beer ( = 10 $ ) and 1 strong cocktail or 2 soft cocktails ( 6-8 $ each ) . 
  therefore it would be around 18-26 $ . 
  counter-proposal : let 's become allies and fight together against france !, 
  indeed i was implying that stereotype is ... * delicious *, 
   on some issues i might be with the right while on others with the ~ ~ left ~ ~ center-right ftfy, 
   swedish ** democrats **  nazism wtf ?!? 
  til two beautiful archaic english words . 
  thanks !, 
   i 'd be pretty shocked to meet someone like that in sweden . 
  guess catholicism is n't very diffused there , is n't it ? 
   `` stupid shit associated with religion '' ( such as being too sure of his views ) lol . 
  you can be passionate and/or stupid even if you are n't religious . 
   what would your reaction be like if somebody ( young ) told you that they go to church every single week ? 
  i would n't react . 
  they just want to be consistent to their beliefs , i guess . 
  in general , i try to be respectful of everyone 's beliefs if i do n't know them very well and always consider their own point of view before entering in some conversation about serious subjects . 
   would you treat or think about this person any differently ? 
  well , it depends . 
  knowing someone 's opinion about abortion and birth control really changes my perception of that particular person . 
  if they had a different opinion than mine ( on this particular subject ) , i 'd just avoid talking about it again . 
  there 's no way to conciliate opposite views , especially if they originate from religion . 
   italians : ice cream and pizza restaurants . 
  who would be the most qualified to make great ice cream and pizza , if not italians ? 
  someone thinks the italian region of [ molise ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molise ) does not exist .
