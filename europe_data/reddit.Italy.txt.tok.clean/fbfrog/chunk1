oh believe me , this is just the beginning . 
  meh , going to amsterdam to smoke pot is so '90s . 
   the point is that right now greece and italy are austere enough to manage their expenses but the interest rate payments are what is bringing them down . 
  nobody yet has made ** the ** obvious comment , omg, 
  they 'll be percieved as natives , or tourists at worst since they 'll have money , papers etc. 
  they might even have the bonus of speaking native english . 
  i think you 're staying out of italy if you know what 's good for you economically-wise , but for academic curiosity yeah , racism is pretty high in some places , although all it takes sometimes is nice dressing and behaving like a `` good person '' , since immigrants here are more often than not illegals who are smuggled through the coasts etc. 
  no , i think it 's incredibly tasteless to joke about nazism , of course they do n't have a plan . 
  congratulations to you too , `` lol italians '', 
  dem white socks . 
  aryan socks , actually . 
  ... , he said , from his nice comfy chair . 
  wow , 14 upvotes on `` everything is going according to plan '' . 
  i saw this like 4 years ago on facebook , it 's crap , it 's stereotypes , and our breakfasts are legendary ( just like all our food of course ) . 
  nice video shared by a eu flag flair . 
  well i 'm happy knowing that scots are level headed and wo n't do any crazy things to get independence . 
  impressive !, 
  we should make a reddit propaganda poster in the style of the american 50s , `` when you downvote , commies win '', 
  yes , i second both of your comments , and i add that if you dare think about this for a second i 'll use my english skills to help godfathers from south italy and usa spread their culture and customs all over the washed out and tasteless european union so you 'll finally learn some proper manners . 
  reddit is fucking horrible as usual , say something out of the hivemind and they downvote you for no goddamn reason . 
  anyway yes , all those things above i 've seen them and know them , and i live in the north . 
  it 's obvious they 're gon na hide that , and as far as the staff being `` friendly '' that has nothing to do with anything . 
  you 're forgetting - a pretty chance of getting illnesses due to the wonderful nhs , including `` cancer '' ( yes , that 's right , cancer ) - enabling state money to go to some thief - being judged like the scum of the earth if you do something `` horrible '' like getting a tattoo or an std ( even if you 're a perfectly healthy person etc ) and a couple of others i forgot because it 's been a while since i left that horrible world behind . 
  giving blood ** is ** indeed wonderful , do n't get me wrong ( do it kids !, 
  ) , it 's italy that ruins everything it touches . 
  do n't remind me of that too :(, 
  uhm ... yes . 
  i fail to see the connection here , but i 'm always against human extincion , 
  and sadly the smartest comment is found sitting here . 
  yes , if we go down this line people should ask italy payments for enslaving the known world back in the days of the roman empire , lol . 
  people ** always ** have killed one another , the 20th century `` only '' intensified this because of the technology . 
  what 's wrong with education today , i still wonder . 
  on one hand , yes . 
  on the other , do n't we have a burden as white men ? 
  it has n't , it 's called `` chatting '' ? 
  jeez, 
  jesus , is europe that much property of a. merkel ? 
  thanks , i know that , 
   it all started when mr. berluscone , king of the italy lol no but seriously , as long as `` italy '' means `` berlusconi '' we might as well talk about pizza . 
  i 'm not here to be an idiotic nationalist , italy is a banana republic , but berlusconi and his `` ministers '' are a joke , period . 
  ah , i see that now . 
  look whatever makes you feel righteous is good for you , what do you want me to say . 
  there 's clearly no team play , no global view on these matters , plus too much nationalism . 
  we must look silly to americans . 
  and this is hurting the economy as a whole , thank you for pointing this out . 
  but yeah team play is impossible in europe , americans know this very well, 
  italians are and will be italians , yet if you replace 20 years with a berlusconi with 20 years with a monti you ca n't deny things would 've been radically different . 
  how nice that you 're quoting word for word , it totally does n't mean you 're being brainwashed . 
  oh well , `` south is lazy '' and all that , whatever makes you feel happy i guess, 
  and here i am arguing with an italian again , apparently i ca n't learn my lessons . 
  anyway  your berlusconi-source-of-all-evils theory lol . 
  let 's just say that if italy had somebody competent for a change in the last 20 years things would n't be so ruined . 
  it 's not what he did , it 's also what he did not . 
   that 's how it came off in the local finnish media there 's your problem ? 
  the media sucks here too , and when it comes to eu politics nothings sells better than nationalism usually . 
   on top of that we now have monti throwing thinly veiled threats . 
  lol what is this the godfather ? 
  look , this may be a geniune case of divide et impera , and things are not this simple anyway . 
  i find it really hard to think monti really went and `` threatened '' the northern countries , not only because it 's stupid but because it makes no sense - what can italy possibly be doing , send waves of pizzas ? 
   two-faced charlatans blaming others for their own mistakes lol , you 're not serious are you . 
  i hope somebody else abroad understands the intricate situation monti has to deal with . 
  and for the record ** no ** , monti 's not blaming anyone for italy 's situation , read the goddamn article . 
  is this advanced trolling ? 
  oh come on . 
  economic recession aside , berlusconi hit italy in almost every way . 
  it 's stupid to deny it . 
  that 's a [ major national issue ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u86salencos ) , yes , but we 're talking about how national monuments are compared to penises here : why the *** leaning *** tower of pisa ? 
  ah yes , the salerno-reggio calabria is legendary . 
  people have been talking and will be talking about this for decades . 
  blue1 _ 's comment explains the technical details pretty well . 
  of course everyone knows of that highway , but what can private citizens do , especially in the south with their mentality . 
  finally we have a technical government in office that is trying to straighten things up and this is of course going to cost right now but is gon na be good on the long run . 
  about the payment per se , mafias are stronger than ever and a public payment will only be seen as a victory medal , if anything . 
  no real solutions have been found to this plague , multinational companies stay away from the relatively cheap italian labour force because of this and they go on their own pretty well abroad . 
  perhaps the long term answer to this lies in the delegation of power at an european level where it might be more difficult for them to be `` connected '' but things do n't look good on that side . 
  omg ** this ** . 
  leave brazil out of it and we ( by which i mean mostly italy , of course ) are the world 's champions !, 
  as an italian i 'd like to ask about the pisa tower . 
  not the size , but ... you know ... 
  shut up flanders . 
  * i know , i 'm sorry , i could n't help it . 
  no seriously , stop drinking propaganda it 's unpleasant to read . 
  i 'm sorry , what ? 
  is trolling invented / best done in the us by any chance ? 
   i 'm sure america has some history . 
  they just killed everybody and brought in slaves ftfy, 
  5 out 5 of ours are on the centre-right , what a surprise . 
  there we go !, 
  i was worried i got off without a warning this time . 
  you rock man !, 
  link to this please ? 
  ok i see your point , got anything to tell to an italian ? 
  now why would you go and insult cyprus like that . 
  how is the dear leader these days ? 
  pff , you do n't get to play this game . 
  get back to your first world country and first world politicians . 
  no no it 's called `` italy '' , get your facts straight !, 
  [ here you go ] ( http://nanobotswillenslaveusall.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/north-korea-best-korea.jpg?w=400&amp;h=294 ), 
  you certainly deserve an upvote , but a question like that i could only answer like [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns_roi0iizw ), 
  perhaps , yes .
