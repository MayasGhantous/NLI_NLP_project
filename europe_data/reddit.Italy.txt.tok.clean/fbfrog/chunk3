  thank god the far left has been banished from the italian parliament !, 
  might be the only good thing berlusconi did . 
  ca n't wait for those old morons to die . 
  that 's poor trolling , you can do better . 
  apply yourself, 
   fuck them . 
  bring on the rainbow and the vaccines !, 
  :p could you stop by italy and bring some rainbows ? 
  it 's not `` gender policing '' omg . 
  replace `` pussy '' with `` weak '' then . 
  still discriminating ? 
   this is the first time i 've heard of reddit having left-wing biases in the european sense of the word . 
  well reddit is left-wing biased in america , just different names because they have a different left , not a big difference . 
  what i hate so much is the bias itself , which can only work against the common good . 
  about internet points , if you 're so worried about losing them it means you 're a pussy ... and , if you ask me , a teenage leftwing idiot , 
  1 ) what is the minimum voting age in germany ? 
  2 ) are you insane or f * cking insane ? 
  3 ) do you even realize what this means ? 
  not just for your great nation but for europe ? 
  actually i was trolling you, 
  fight the powaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 
  from what i hear , in the us it 's east vs west, 
  it 's late and i 'm just passing by , but i 'll upvote this just for the title . 
  `` waving a big stick '' . 
  you sure know how to spell subtle things do you , 
  oh come on , do n't feed the troll, 
  so you think monti would openly spout prejudices ? 
  it 's lost in translation . 
  what monti said is `` italy good , not going to be like greece '' . 
  being a cultured person he tried to say it in a more elegant way : italy evaded the drift in the economical direction of greece ( i.e. 
  defaults , etc ) . 
  it 's not monti 's fault that greece is geographically south-east of italy , is it ? 
  i know we had berlusconi but now our government is polite and civilized as any other european one . 
  i also notice at the bottom that the article is translated using an english wine glossary . 
  any more prejudices ? 
  i 'm stroking my italian mustacchio right now . 
  what can i say : historical events happen , but people do n't change ? 
  venezia used to be a good trade republic back in the days , very politically progressive as well, 
  veneto has the highest total pil of any region in the whole country . 
  best as usual :p, 
  there are many , many names for that of course  spinello is the official but `` cannone '' is also widely used, 
  thanks, 
  not that it matters but  basically its about tradition , anti-globalization , anti-immigration , socially conservative . 
  that 's fascism right there . 
  that being said no , i do n't know much about the french far right . 
  i feel it 's more like my neighbour who defends his `` liberty '' to kill me . 
   and we also have been selling canons to them in that time lol in italian `` cannons '' = `` joints '', 
   tbh i think if you move to a country you should integrate whether you are european or middle eastern . 
  why i agree absolutely , these people act like it 's their home country and send as much money as possible back , not contributing to the economy like a native citizen and going directly against western standards of living . 
  it 's then obvious that people ask themselves `` if you love your country so much , why do n't you just stay there ? '', 
  still i do n't think electing the far right is going to get anywhere ... 
  is n't this dangerously high ? 
  the italian fascist party is no more and it never got over 5 % , despite having mussolini 's niece in it . 
  i 'm feeling this is basically all about immigration from former french colonies , people who do n't integrate and are radical muslims . 
  is that it ? 
  which brings me to ask : is there a broad support to far right in france ? 
  i mean if he advertises to the far right so much it means there must be a broad demographic for this . 
  is n't this a bit scary ? 
  in 2012 , no less ? 
  no it was a `` i 'm saying good luck because everything else would be bad '', 
  hm , sounds like what happened in italy when the garden gnome came to power , more or less . 
  it 's hard for a political party to be `` for the people '' since the berlin wall came down , money is the god for every soul and there 's no `` class identity '' anymore . 
  the latter two were maybe bought to you by propaganda . 
  as for uncle sam , let 's brace ourselves . 
  he 's still a thousand times better than the alternative . 
  may i ask then who voted for them and why ? 
  in english `` the hunger '' is called `` the munchies '' . 
  of course , i know this because i study english ** so hard ** man . 
  you all act like this is `` news '' . 
  even in the 80 's there were corporations that were richer than most countries . 
  maybe not so in the technological sector , but still . 
  again not in the `` news '' , literally speaking , is the traditional liberal-school thought that private economic powers should n't be that big ( corporated ) or make alliances . 
  that 's the spirit that bought bill gates , just to name a person , to trial . 
  i also think disney is still the biggest one of all , although i may be wrong . 
   ** perhaps ** germans take a different stance on these things . 
  also italy was invaded . 
  also italians are different from germans . 
  also italy is deeply catholic . 
  also ever heard of this `` mafia '' . 
  * perhaps * germans take a different stance on these things . 
  i 'm not an expert , i never said i was . 
  it 's f * ucking complex . 
  grab a history book . 
  and of course i 'm generalizing , human beings are n't made in factories all the same . 
  also italy never had a centralized state like all other european countries . 
  france for example , used to be a monarchy where you could n't vote but you were a subject of the king etc , all french shared a common identity . 
  same goes for the british , and so on . 
  the italian peninsula on the other hand used to be a mixture of different monarchies , republics , the church had its state ... it 's complex . 
  i do n't even think the `` why '' matters , unless you 're looking for a racist explaination, 
  i only watched the first half minute and i think it does , answer the question :  it 's a shame in ** civilized ** 2012 ... in athens , where ** civilization ** was born ... 
  there you have it . 
  un-civilized places borrow too much money without even thinking of paying it back , are corrupted , do n't have a minimum sense of common good , think of themselves `` cunning '' while they really are exploited by organized international criminals ... you get the picture . 
  it 's basically what happens in italy , where also civilization was born ( well , sort of ) . 
  but that happened thousands of years ago and much history happened since then in both countries . 
  so until they approach this in a ** civilized ** manner , everything is useless . 
  yes , even the savage bursts of generosity or the women crying in the streets . 
  trust me i know what i 'm talking about , i live here . 
  it 's not that people are `` all good '' or `` all bad '' , it 's the lack of organization and common accepted rules . 
  even charities often end up hurting the general population , and people still think the pope is some sort of angel sent down from god to do good while there 's an ocean of proof that the catholic church is a big criminal organization . 
  i could go on all day , but i think i made my point , and also suggested what really should be done .
