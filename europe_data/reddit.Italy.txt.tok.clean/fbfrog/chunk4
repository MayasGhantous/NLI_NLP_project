  any other measure is temporary . 
  somebody 's been trying [ the diplomatic approach ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/world/europe/14vatican.html ) , let 's hope it all goes for the best ... 
  yes technically the vatican is its own state ( an absolute monarchy of course ) but the thing is , they plant all kinds of businesses in italy and can afford to have lower prices since they do n't pay a single $ in taxes . 
  this includes hospitals ... also the relations between the church and the state are regulated by [ a set of laws ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lateran_treaty ) made by ... wait for it ... 
  ( sigh ) classic hypocrisy of course , but they are a financial power and they have such an influence on the average moron 's mind that they can do a lot of funny things like launder money for the mafia , cheat the even basic taxes thanks to berlusconi ... you know , `` because jesus '' . 
  things however seem to be getting better , millimeter by millimeter : apparently people in that ~ ~ organization ~ ~ church complain about the lack of ~ ~ mental grip ~ ~ faith so maybe this thing will end someday . 
  it will always be too damn late tho ... 
  his taxes sure do n't ... 
  i 'll let the comment above prove everything i 've said about greeks being stupid , uncivilized , blaming the government they elected and so forth . 
  oh and absolutely , 10 years a perfectly reasonable time for greece to get up , they will have eaten so much public funds . 
  lol oh and btw yes , i 've travelled pretty much all the old europe and i 'm glad there 's greece to be such an ugly trashcan of human and material waste , you make italy look slightly better in comparison . 
  thanks !, 
  or , you know , have a techincal government like the one italy 's having . 
  having a government from another country really does sound too humiliating , even for them . 
  well , i agree with the rest of the post , of course being the scum they are they 'll never thank anyone . 
  if only there was a way to kick them out of the union , let them default by their own without bleeding the public funds . 
  then they could get their act together , or come work in the eu provided they take rehabilitations class , like prison inmates should . 
  because that 's what they are , thieves and cheaters , from the very beginning of their entrance in the eu . 
  as i 've stated above i 'm no fan of italy but we 've tried and tried to enter the eu and now to set things as straight as possible . 
  and believe me , there 's no such thing as `` italian pride '' these days , except maybe the hopeless wastelands in the south . 
  hm , tell you what : they start admitting they ruined the country all by themselves and that the eu is helping them , and i 'll stop being a dick about it : deal ? 
   europe is giving money to greece , not taking it . 
  usual try at distorting the logic , nothing new . 
   i ca n't help but to think that they ca n't comprehend the situation they are in . 
  if they had some brains , they would n't be in this mess to begin with . 
  no , they do n't understand anything . 
   are they not self aware ? 
  no , of course . 
   the greeks brought this situation unto themselves [ ... ] should n't be in the position to demonize the feeding hand . 
  they should n't but taking money and then demonizing the hand makes it easier for greeks , so it looks like they do n't have any debts with anyone . 
  you know what the sad part is ? 
  they 'll probably get away with this . 
  i feel sorry for germany and all the northern europe countries that they give away so much money while working hard and obeying the laws . 
  oh well , i hope the evil , corrupt , and essentially satan politicians will be more mature with this and make sure greece pays . 
  and stays in line . 
  for that matter i also hope italy goes in line , monti is gradually trying to do so at least . 
  yeah , come to think of it , nobody 's burning down rome so that makes us `` more civilized '' than greeks . 
  sad lol ... 
  if only you retards would visit greece for a single week . 
  not you makedon , the `` oh my god poor greeks '' naives . 
  sanity is what most people are and think , it 's reddit that induces white knight syndromes that are pathetic to the limits . 
  oh , and they all care ** so ** much about imaginary internet points they 're willing to do anything to grab them . 
  my god . 
   it 's not like their government was oppressing them . 
  i agree . 
  the same type of reasoning you find in italy : no matter how democratically elected the government is , it 's all their fault and their fault only . 
  this is clearly talk from people who do n't act as citizens and only think of politics ( `` that kinda stuff '' ) once in a while : does n't it look childish and uncivilized ? 
  they steal from the government for years without remorse : does n't it look scum ? 
  does anything the greeks do look like they 're able to run a country ? 
  not only politicians ( who , again , are elected ** by the people !, 
  ** ) run the country but honest citizens who look after the public thing , pay taxes because it 's right and not because they have to , and so on . 
  flobin , we agree . 
  and everybody thinks like that . 
  it 's that simple , really . 
  it 's just that saying the greeks are dumbasses is n't acceptable so they come up with all kinds of excuses and they agree ... on the internet , in public . 
  behind closed doors , it 's a totally different story . 
  personally i 've travelled just enough to see that there are no magic tricks or mystical implications in this kind of things . 
  this is n't advanced physics : pay your taxes , be a good boy and do n't spend all day thinking how you could steal money and you 'll be fine . 
   we ca n't save ourself without saving greece , that 's the point . 
  maybe so , but that does n't change what i 've said . 
   ** the greeks have been spending more than they 've earned for decades . 
  ** who cares if somebody profited from that . 
  they enjoyed the sweet life because they 're `` smarter '' and now have the brilliant idea of burning down athens . 
  and somehow , somebody thinks it 's the politicians ' fault !, 
  are you all joking me ? 
   blaming yourself or the others it 's not very useful or mature without thinking and working to a real solution again , not the goddamn point . 
  but fair enough , you want a real solution ? 
  teach greeks to be responsible , that stealing is wrong and you should pay back if you steal . 
  you know , 10 year old stuff . 
  of course , same goes for italians . 
  economics talk , lol . 
  thanks , you make me feel better . 
  as a person , a citizen of italy and of the glorious european union . 
  and no , no punishment for nobody . 
  let 's give the greeks some more unlimited cash , seems the right thing to do : are n't they poor ? 
  now i 'm off to see what celebrities are doing , and will watch the latest julia roberts movie . 
  care to join sweetie ? 
  finally , somebody with a grain of salt and some balls to say this !, 
   is n't a government a representation of the people ? 
  absolutely ; it 's a rule of the majority , so it represents what ** most ** of the population thinks . 
  everywhere , at least where the elections are n't a joke . 
   italians voted in freaking berlusconi more than once . 
  do they deserve to be humiliated for that ? 
  well , maybe not every single one of them personally , but they voted for him . 
  that 's pretty much it . 
  the same moronic sub-humans who voted for `` uncle '' benito voted for uncle silvio because he was a `` real man '' ( argh ) and most importantly , they did n't want to carry the burden of being citizens . 
  either that or the trash in naples is sent by the gods above . 
  btw they voted berlusconi ** four ** times , should anybody else need `` proof '' ( lol ) . 
  germans also had a pretty ... controversial figure in charge at the time but look at them : they clearly understood the lesson , they teach it their children and are a model of democracy and efficiency for the planet . 
  hard to believe hitler and mussolini shaked hands , right ? 
  that 's all i have to say for the italian populace . 
  am i italian ? 
  100 % , yes . 
  are all italian stupid pathetic dumbasses ? 
  no , but there are enough so we do n't get the economic and political machine working to decent standards . 
  is this post original ? 
  not by a long shot . 
  rarely truth is new or shocking . 
  so , about greece : why does everyone keep saying they 're nothig but uncivilized scum with child brains who ca n't even run a country ? 
  because they are , and any other `` humanitarian '' explaination can go fuck itself .
