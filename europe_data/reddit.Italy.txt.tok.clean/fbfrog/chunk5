  of course there are honest and educated greeks but this is politics , ** numbers ** count . 
  yeah yeah enough with this bullshit . 
  greece fucking ** deserves ** to be humiliated , along with italy . 
  there , i said it . 
  being italian , i wonder what your politically correct replies will be , or will you just downvote me . 
  [ boo hoo hoo ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/228/703/first-world-problems-ii.jpg ) . 
  sounds like our head of state . 
  it 's basically somebody who has a 7 year mandate , once for lifetime , is in charge of the army ( well the constitution is old ) and most importantly is there to make sure the real government does n't get too stupid . 
  like a parent , if you will . 
  our current president napolitano played a difficult part when berlusconi was governing , as he tried to make italy look decent . 
  why thank you !, 
  expect full support to acta from italian `` politicians '' . 
  it 's a surprise if italians can read in the first place , and television (  80 % of the populace 's only source of infos ) is full of anti-internet propaganda because it ca n't be regimented like the television channels of don silvio . 
  i know , i know , trust me i have it worse than you living here . 
  all the best, 
  yeeeah ... 
  i 've read all the comments and seen all the maps ... does this have actual real implications or is it just academic curiosity ? 
  i do n't know exactly where 's the line between science and `` omg that 's racist '' . 
  _________________________________________ as a joke , is there a website where you can order an attractive wife with all genetic datas displayed ? 
  that 'd be cool . 
  or a genetic consultant that tells me how to breed more efficiently ? 
  disregard the `` best school '' or `` better company '' , `` better genes '' is the real step ahead . 
  i 'm thinking of the future of my children [ even years before they 're born ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mastermind ) . 
  and if they turn out bad i can always keep the reciept and blame the manufacturer . 
  i 'm sorry , i should n't drink . 
  blame the [ genes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jeans ) . 
  omg offended !, 
  i mean that it 's one of the most well adjusted countries in this planet where people sure are n't forced to leave to find work . 
  so sorry , you had doubts !, 
  omg !!, 
  i 'd like to officially apologize to the fine people of denmark lol, 
  but that 's like saying germany has exploited immigrants since the end of ww2 !, 
  have an upvote . 
  this day and age , do ** not ** make fun of places without work . 
  ** not ever . 
  ** especially coming from denmark . 
  also apparently we need to hear it from cnn , because you know it 's not like we have news in europe . 
  maybe so , still a strong statement from the prime minister . 
  like a taxi driver `` it 's ok , i 'm drunk get in '' also really , how hard is this law to understand . 
  if israel would just stop to interfere with world affairs , we would be better off . 
  we all want our promised land, 
  we need to see through the smoke , not shout what people want to hear !, 
  exactly . 
  also how can people not miss the fact that `` no pirates yes to copyright yeah to legality '' can become a full internet censorship in the blink of an eye ? 
  bootlegging goes back to when we had vhs and cassette recorders people ; this is not , and never has been , an issue of downloading an mp3 . 
  wake the fuck up jesus christ, 
  - generally agree with the comment on pity : when bashing europe is their last resource you know they 've gone not only full retard but full broke ( and it sure was n't the walfare state 's fault and they ca n't even see through this huge logical gap , they had their chances now they 're a lost cause ) . 
  - cut all ties with them financially and they 'll be begging at our ** closed ** doorstep - official ultimatum on the uk on where they stand , enough of this blatant hypocrisy . 
  either 100 % european union with our currency and everything or get out . 
  - solidarity among eu countries to generally reinforce the union as well as our mutual feelings ( enough with the past it 's 2012 already ) . 
  - grab some popcorn and mercilessly watch the show, 
  ~ ~ i 'll cook dinner , buy some candles and put some mus ~ ~ fuck it , i 'm out , 
  that depends : will you comfort me when i feel sad and lonely , on those long winter nights ? 
  ok , i will . 
  - greetings from a pigs country, 
  `` i stand corrected '' , then . 
  in my defense the whole world scratches its head and wishes for a babelfish when talking to you . 
  let 's not get sentimental here  your explaination fully appreciated !, 
  oh right , i knew about the expression but did n't make the leap . 
  thanks !, 
  it says a lot that you take this seriously , `` omg '' . 
  sorry i do n't understand , you mean the fight is pointless ? 
  the ** real ** problem is that whenever israel is accused of something , even if you have tons of proof , they -- - hitler - hitler - hitler before you can say anything else . 
  very useful tactic , a huge play on the average moron 's emotions . 
  then they can go back doing whatever they want , you do n't want to be an antisemite do you ?!? 
  but that 's another ( sad ) story . 
  getting back to this stupidity , '' * anti-semitism is deep-rooted in germany * '' . 
  ** the fuck does that even mean ? 
  ** do they have a thermometer ? 
  a `` jewhating meter '' ? 
  my-cousin-once-told-me-so ? 
  hence my comment earlier on the popcorn : this is 0 % news and 100,00 % drama because the british need to talk bad about some other country before tea time . 
  like anybody really cares about this in the times we 're living in , stop posting these tabloids toilet paper . 
  but i do \u2665 drama lol, 
  how about your neighbours that you call `` pigs '' show up as a legion like the good old days . 
  you know , when my ancestors discovered an island they would call * britannia * ? 
  then we can see if harry potter stands a chance . 
  i 'll even concede your first attempt at spellcasting , then we 'll * take it from there * ... 
  then how dare you `` quiet '' me if you only live in a small isolated house ? 
  this is [ / r/europe ] ( / r/europe ) so i can tell you to [ getoffmylawn ] ( http://0.tqn.com/d/politicalhumor/1/0/g/z/1/mccain_get_off_lawn.jpg ) . 
  god i wish i had popcorn and something that tells me when/if this hits . 
  they do n't make drama that good in movies anymore . 
  a translation for those who read quickly :  it depends , we can play it both ways because we can rely on the us so we play the eu card but only when it suits us, 
  they may be fewer but i appreciate a thousand times more the european `` lulz '' over the americans . 
  perhaps because i relate a bit more . 
  100 % agree ; also italy is trying to get things in line and while it will never be a scandinavian country , if we manage to stay on this `` hard '' path the whole european union will be better , each single citizen . 
  what i 'd ask santa claus , for the good of the whole eu , is politicians in line who do their job instead of populism , corruption etc, 
  yeah , s&p downgraded pigs mostly . 
  nordic countries will keep on being fine i suppose . 
  hungary is being downgraded and there are conflicts brewing in the balkan area , another article where drama  news, 
   america has the best schools in the world . 
  not sure if trolling or & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; x 1000000000, 
  i even forgot about that !, 
  well that proves the point , if * psyops * can convince people to be afraid of tap water they can make you think anything , provided you are ignorant enough : they 're bashing the education system to a point people will soon believe only the bible and that science is evil ; for some reasons they want them so ignorant that a new dark ages is being created with incredible speed . 
  more points in favour of cutting off any link with the us , i guess . 
  i think that given the situation right now we should realize that europe is a special , unique place in the world , where you can have `` capitalism '' ( whatever it is ) and not die because you ca n't afford medical care . 
  not to mention culture and basically the birthplace of the west , among other things . 
  from that we should forget the past , become europeans at heart and really start working on our problems , of which we have plenty , but at least they 're worth solving : even if the us solve their strictly * economical * problems they 're always going to be a brainwashed brutal dollarocracy where the elite sends their children to study here . 
  nah , just your standard brainwashing . 
  give me enough media powers i 'll convince people that water kills you in a few months .
