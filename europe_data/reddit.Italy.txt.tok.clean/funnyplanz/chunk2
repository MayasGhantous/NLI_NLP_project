   italy is not taking so much out of the eu structural funds anymore so you were wrong , good . 
  edit : actually , went and found italy 's contribution to the eu budget from 2004 to 2007 . 
  italy has always been the third or fourth largest contributor to the european budget . 
  you can fuck right off with the `` anymore '' part - we never got free money pouring into our wallets donated by the long-suffering german tax-payer . 
  the money was badly administered , that 's for sure , but we ** never got free money from you ** . 
  you can get off your sanctimonious soapbox . 
   if we change our laws ( assuming that is legally possible ) to stop admitting asylum-seekers , what keeps any prosperous country within the eu from changing the laws to stop poor , jobless eu citizens from other eu states to come in ? 
  well , easy : they 'd have to get out of the union . 
  the whole point of this shitshow called eu is to facilitate the movement of goods and people inside the union 's borders . 
  if a country wants to be in total control of its immigration flows , that 's a sovereign country 's prerogative ; they 'd just have to fuck off . 
  i do n't really see the point of this question ? 
   but explain to me how they can come in legally , but refugees who are entitled to as well ca n't . 
  listen , you have every right to say italians/greeks/spaniards are just the same as refugees . 
  what you 're damn hard trying to imply is that migrants from middle eastern , north african or asian countries are comparable to migrants from southern europe , and that migration from both sets of native regions poses the same issues . 
  that kind of willful ignorance is laughable and cute . 
  apart from the sheer numbers , since i doubt there 's 1 million/year of southern europeans coming today to germany with only the clothes on their backs , the circumstances are wildly different , and that 's evident to anybody in possession of a working pair of eyes and half a brain . 
  these new migrants are only going to be a drain on your social system for quite some time , no way around it . 
  hopefully you know that 2/3 of them are barely literate - good luck with that . ^ ( wait , maybe you do think only two thirds of italians or spaniards are literate !, 
  after all italy is only `` supposedly '' a first world country lol ) . 
  or does germany have 500.00-600 .000 vacant jobs lying around that are easily doable by people who do n't speak german and maybe have only a cursory knowledge of the latin alphabet ? 
  so you 'll have to provide free housing ( that the migrant poor eu citizens do n't get , btw ) and full benefits for years , while 1 ) trying to give this new population - 70 % men - some kind of education ( in the case of most afghans refugees , that actually means teaching them to read and write ) , since we all agree that education is key to integration , and 2 ) trying to make them integrate into german society and make them accept western values and culture ; all the while hoping that they wo n't integrate into shady parallel communities instead ; all the while having to support the inevitable boatload of children , who in twenty or thirty years might very well turn on your society ( see what 's happening in france and the uk right now , what with the growing support for extremism ) . 
  yes - internal eu migration is definitely the same as refugee migration from muslim-majority countries . ^ / s, 
  lol mate your anger issues are showing . 
  the fact that italy has its own widespread problems is in no way relevant to the discussion at hand . 
  if that 's making you salty , you are more than welcome to open a thread to discuss italy 's failures , if you are you so inclined . 
  go on , vent all the frustration in your little heart . 
  just remember that italy is still putting more in the total eu budget than it is taking out - in 2013 we were the fourth largest contributors . 
  maybe your idiotic anger would be better directed at eastern european countries , or say , spain , greece , portugal , ireland , etc - countries that do get money `` pouring '' into them . 
  nor do italy ( and france ) get any rebates , unlike , say , germany . 
  not to mention that germany has been actually benefitting from the existence of weaker countries in the eu - but that is another really , really long story . 
  yeah , your analogy is mind-numbingly dumb . 
  now , pray tell , how does the fact that italy 's got large internal unemployment related to the topic at hand - which is that 90 % of your sweet refugees are gon na be unemployed or unemployable for quite some time ? 
  pretty standard tbh . 
  of course , it 's more like $ 2000/month because there 's most utilities factored in . 
  actually i think the city is ` pretty affordable ' on the upper end , if that makes any sense . 
  a friend of mine is renting a stunning loft in the heart of the city center , about 180 sq m i 'd guess + a beautiful terrace with a great view and she pays about $ 3200 ( split with another friend ) . 
  that 's good money but i would have guessed more upon seeing the flat and location . 
  that same flat in rome would have cost $ 5000 at least . 
  porta venezia . 
  it 's a nice neighbourhood in the city center , and my flat is quite nice in an old turn-of-the-century building . 
  still , comparing rents , it does n't get much lower than $ 500 monthly for a room + utilities if you want to be reasonably close to the city/not live in the unsafe run-down parts of the suburbs . 
  this city ( well , this country ) is expensive . 
  * weeps quietly *, 
  that 's not nearly enough to live on in italy . 
  what 's your city because i want to move there !, 
  my rent + utilities only is $ 600 in milan ( and i share this apartment with other 3 people ) . 
  that 's milan of course , but even in less glamorous places you 'd maybe , just maybe , get by with $ 850 . 
  certainly not fully support yourself and have a comfortable life . 
  i am italian . 
  i do feel some warm fuzzy kinship with other european folks on the basis of so much shared history ( even the bad and tragic history ) but it 's completely independent from the actual european union . 
  i 'm getting more anti-eu by the day but my european identity is pretty strong . 
  yeah basically . 
  guess they 're all in the us by now . 
  what the heck are you talking about ? 
  left-wingers in italy are n't just communists of course , although the far-leftists definitely are . 
  communist is n't a dirty word you know . 
  music to my half-colombian ears lel, 
  you 're disgusting , congrats, 
   which is why we have to try to reduce the influx before our limits are reached which means acknowledging the fundamental failure of the blindly humanitarian movement . 
  what it all boils down to is : `` we 're doing this for humanity , but since it 's apparent that doing it #forhumanity becomes problematic on a massive scale and on the long term , we 're going to try everything we can to stop you before you can reach us , exploit our humanitarian law and become a burden for us . '', 
  imo , this means that the idealism behind the usual humanitarian/free borders mumbo jumbo is hollow , or better : not really prepared to live up to itself unto the bitter end . 
  which is natural !, 
  and right . 
  but still . 
  i 'm not anti-idealism tbh ( i think it 's good for a society to have a percentage of idealists and dreamers ) but there 's a certain hypocrisy in making blanket statements like `` we have to accept the refugees into our own homes because they 're humans and that trumps all '' and then trying to figure out how to make sure less of them reach our borders , like bribing turkey into stopping them before they cross over . 
  that being said , thanks for the nice chat !, 
  nope . 
  in my country tumblr has basically no influence on the popular culture . 
  our far left is just clinging onto old marxist buzzwords and dreams , not realising that they 're tragically anachronistic , and some post-modern mumbo jumbo . 
   partly . 
  yes , there is a factual limit . 
  but no , this is entirely different to setting a random number of people that you are willing to take in . 
  if one is to accept a factual limit then the nice idealism of `` we 're doing this for humanity '' is bull . 
  doing things for humanity boils down to `` we must help other human beings because they 're human beings '' , a moral imperative that acknowledges no bounds . 
  either you ( general you ) sacrifice for humanity for humanity 's sake only , or you 're just using the humanitarian rhetoric to feel good until it is no longer convenient . 
  if germany were to get one million migrants per year for five years , i think at the end of year 5 most would eschew the #forhumanity song and dance and look more closely at the associated costs ( which are not only economic ) of doing stuff ` for humanity ' . 
  sweden is basically getting there . 
  agree on the fact that many countries hide behind their lack of resources . 
   not even germany can cope with continuous influx of millions of people a year thank you , exactly . 
  which means that humanitarian concerns do have a limit and are n't as universal as they 're purported to be . 
  the heart bleeds until a certain point , then logical objective reasoning kicks in - especially in those countries that do n't have the resources to handle the migrant crisis as germany . 
  i agree that we have to wait and see . 
  i do think things are going to change but the influx is unlikely to slow down before 2017 and who knows how this conflict is going to play out . 
  your whole post basically boils down to the `` we brought this upon ourselves '' old hat . 
  so , now that we have acknowledged this ( and really , it is reasonable ) , what do we do ? 
   whether or not the syrian refugees are already highly skilled or not does n't actually effect the overall argument of whether we should allow them to take refuge in our own countries or not i think there 's a point where humanitarian concerns need to be considered against economic and social concerns . 
  there 's 60 million people displaced by war in the world right now . 
  i bet at least 50 % of them would love to live in europe and enjoy our nice way of life . 
  but if 30 million people decided to seek asylum here , i think many humanitarian souls would begin to see how objectivity is needed alongside idealism . 
  truth is the old banal `` we ca n't let everybody in '' . 
  we have n't reached the breaking point yet , of course - far from it tbh . 
  but pure idealism is bullshit . 
  you 're just assuming that the refugee stop will be over by the time 2016 comes . 
  this conflict and associated turmoil is gon na last for years . 
  eu official predictions were 3 million refugees total for the whole of europe by 2017 , but if germany alone is looking at 1 million just in 2015 , i think numbers are gon na be way higher ; not even counting family reunification and the fact that many ( most ? ), 
  asylum seekers stay even after their request is refused . 
  you 're making things simpler and more straight-forward than they are . 
  maybe there 's some miscommunication going on between us . 
  i think we agree on the fact that there is a big problem staring at us right in the face . 
  what i meant to say is that the fact that syrians are marginally more educated than afghans does n't mean too much for us ( meaning europeans ) - we 'll still have to subsidise these refugees/migrants/whathaveyou for years , while we wait for them to get or complete their education ( in the case of syrians ) and literally learn to read and write and then get said education ( in the case of afghans ) ** and also ** try and integrate in our societies and accept our values .
