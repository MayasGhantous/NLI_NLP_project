  lmao i 'm not even left anymore also yes i 'm very smart ty, 
  well that would be a weird law . 
  `` yeah you can be naked in public but only if you stand up and never sit/touch stuff with your genital/ass area '', 
  do n't forget that they 'll get the chance to get thoroughly radicalised in prison by some rogue jail imam :d, 
  it 's so poignant, 
  oh god . 
  chemical peels at home . 
  really ? 
  starting from the fact that most of them ( thankfully ) are not powerful enough to do significant healing , anybody who 's reading , ** do n't do chemical peels at home ** , especially not those that are labelled as professional level . 
  the risk of permanent damage is ** very high ** in the hands of people who have no medical level training . 
  my mother has treated tens if not hundreds of people who have fucked up entire skin patches thanks to diy . 
  what the fuck . 
  also the difference between healthy tan and sunburn is very slight for many skin types , it only can take minutes of over-exposure and the effects only show a few hours later oftentimes . 
  anyway do as you please but do n't tell people they can do chemical peels at home ffs . 
  `` trigger you '' lmao you 're such a moron . 
  i 'm against current refugee policies as much as you seems to be but i have n't gone full retard , unlike you . 
  it 's impossible to discuss with people who just are n't able to get any nuance . 
  these procedures are ** not ** affordable by everyone , especially if multiple areas are to be treated like decolletage , neck and face . 
  also , there are other places that show significant sun damage , such as hands . 
  also , not everybody is comfortable with the most aggressive procedures . 
  also , extensive sun damage is not always 100 % erasable , marketing notwithstanding . 
  also results last as long as you take religious care of your skin after the procedure , or the damage will start piling on again . 
  my mother is a dermatologist and makes a pretty penny thanks to it . 
  anyway , extensive tanning may be pleasant for some but it is not healthy . 
  more needs to be done to raise awareness about the risks of sun exposure and i 'm not sure that `` but you can erase it with laser ! '', 
  is the best way to go about it . 
  this comment is bizarre . 
  1 ) the surreality of a first date over drinks where the conversation turns to traumatic experiences like gang rape 2 ) the specificity of `` nine iraqis '' ( had they been nine germans i guess the experience would have been kinda better ? ), 
  3 ) the hilariousness of `` and yet , she deserves love just like all of us do '' - what , is somebody arguing that a woman who was raped does n't deserve love ? 
  prolonged sun damage is never fully reversible , and there are possible side effects to most cosmetic procedures . 
  also , not everybody can afford this kind of stuff , especially the more sophisticated procedures . 
  that 's talking about the vanity aspect . 
  then there 's also the health aspect - all tanning raises your risk of a variety of skin ( and also eye ) cancers , and sunscreen is n't a guaranteed defence ( more like 50-70 % less chance of developing skin cancer than someone who does n't use it ) . 
   in case they decide not to move and just sit at home and mope and be scared of their husbands and fathers then it means they are n't worthy of western freedoms in the first place . 
  that 's not very generous is it ? 
  these women could potentially face beatings , or worse , if they decided to go to the beach dressed as western women . 
  idk , i do n't feel like shitting on them if they just do n't have it in them to stick it to the man . 
  i feel very bad for these women . 
  `` the nine iraqi men arrested in vienna and two other provinces over the weekend are aged between 21 and 47 years and deny any wrongdoing , a police spokesman said . 
  all have either applied for , or been granted , asylum . '', 
  yeah fuck that shit , i 100 % agree , but i 'm afraid this just wo n't help the women at all . 
  are we sure they 're all going to go `` ah ok , imma wear a bikini to the beach then '' ? 
  i think it 's more likely they just wo n't go at all . 
  hah i feel strongly about this because my mother is a dermatologist . 
  whatever the reason for spending the summer roasting in the sun , the fact remains that it 's incredibly harmful to the skin , especially for northern fair skins . 
  wrt women ( who are traditionally more preoccupied with beauty matters ) , prolonged sun exposure at peak hours is not only unadvisable from a health standpoint but , even with sun cream , brings about wrinkles , sun spots and a general deterioration of skin quality . 
  of course it 's not immediately evident but it becomes more and more apparent after age 30 . 
  this is why generally asian women retain much better skin and for longer than european women . 
  many of them have also extremely anal skincare routines and the best of skincare innovation comes from korea and japan . 
  of course in the end everybody gets ugly , so take it as you want . 
  it 's not that asian women stay home in the dark , they just put on a shitload of sun cream and some use parasols . 
  roasting in the sun for 3 months every year is n't necessary for good mental health . 
  a woman wearing a burkini is n't imposing you shit tho ? 
  how does one woman 's choice of swimwear interfere with your freedom to dress as you please ? 
  joke 's on the west though because the sun destroys the skin af, 
  i 'd argue that i do n't want to sit on the same subway seat some guy sat on with his bare ass but that 's just me maybe, 
  well , this at least is pretty honest . 
  hijab at least is optional - most muslim countries do n't require that women cover their heads and/or faces . 
  but i ca n't see any fundie muslim man telling his wife `` ok , you can go to the beach wearing this one-piece suit that shows your hair and also your neck , arms , legs and crotch , no problems '' . 
  what is going to happen is more likely going to be that women will just give up on going to the beach or will simply go all dressed up as usual without being able to bathe . 
  actually what is more likely to happen will be that nobody will care and they 'll just go to the next town 's beach because i ca n't see this becoming a national law . 
  actually , this probably would have been more useful if it was a nation wide ban . 
  at least in that case all muslim household would have to deal with the fact that either you show some skin or you can stay home . 
  would still be on the fascist side of things but i guess it would achieve at least * something * instead of this inconsequential stuff . 
  are you arguing that anybody who comes to europe should adopt our culture * tout court * with no space for cultural differences ? 
  are we going to ban , say , people speaking arabic in public , because our culture dictates speaking euro languages and people may be perturbed by the sound of a semite language ? 
  the swimsuit you just linked to would never be ok for a muslim woman , but also for an orthodox jewish , fundie christian , obese & insecure woman , etc. 
  look i 'm the first one who does n't like islam and thinks muslims should rethink a lot of things about their faith ( and also stop flooding the continent ) but the fact remains that i do n't see how this ban is in any way useful . 
  this is only going to marginalise some already marginalised women and achieve fuck all . 
  personally , i 'm much more offended by some old guy with a flabby gut wearing speedos than by a muslim woman tending to her children in a burkini . 
  have we arrived to the point that western society in the summertime = women 's breasts + stomach + arms + legs on full display and anybody who just does n't feel comfortable with that ( be they muslims , orthodox jews , devout christians , overweight women , etc. ), 
  just needs to stay home or comply ? 
  and what would that be ? 
  currently mainstream swimwear for women is made up of bikinis , more or less skimpy one-pieces ( 2/3 of them with deep necklines ) or tankinis ( bottom panties + more or less skimpy top ) . 
  devout muslim women can not display their crotch or their legs , or their stomach , or their cleavage , and if they wear hijab , they can not display their hair . 
  any of the three options above would be skimpy swimwear for them . 
  so logically they should wear some kind of wetsuit or a leggings + top combo with a head covering of some sort . 
  which is exactly what the burkini is . 
   the only reason they are is because of the retarded christian laws which ban them being exposed in public . 
  that might be the origin , but today , even my atheist ass just does n't want to see people 's genitalia in public places . 
  also , public nudity would offend the sensibilities of not only christians , but also muslims , jews , sikhs , hindu etc etc. 
  there are nudist beaches where everybody can disrobe as they please . 
   i do n't think it should be illegal to have sex in public either . 
  i would n't do it personally but if someone else does then who gives a fuck ? 
  its not like they are harming you in any way . 
  a couple fucking next to me at the beach ? 
  no thanks . 
  i 'll call the police on their asses . 
  the act offends both my eyes and ears ( especially when you get the screaming banshees ) , so it does harm me by lowering my enjoyment of the public space . 
  i can only go to the beach to enjoy the sea , they have 1001 private places they could fuck at . 
   i do n't think `` it offends muh sensibilities '' is a good enough reason to make something illegal . 
  i think it is , if it offends a majority of individual people 's sensibilities . 
  i just do n't want to see sex organs , bodily functions or sexual acts and practices ( fetish roleplaying included ) in the public space . 
  edit :  the same can not be said for nudity laws . 
  this is also wrong because one could certainly argue that touching places that have been touched by bare genitalia/anuses could constitute a health hazard , e.g. 
  a seat in a fast food or subway train . 
  i think the name burkini just does n't help . 
  people hear `` burk - '' and freak out . 
  it should be called hijabi swimwear or something . 
  yes but gut and man tits are not as inherently sexual and private as the actual * genitalia * .
