  wars cost money , and a lot of people gains from blood . 
  you do n't realize that attacking an eu country would mean an embargo from the [ most important countries russia has tradings with ( germany , netherlands , italy , poland , etc ) ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/rus/ ) . 
  it would be a suicide for them . 
  i do n't have feelings of * hate * nor * love * about geopolitics . 
  us , china and russia are big guys , they need to keep their colossal , money draining system working and in order to do so they need to ensure a good flow of primary resources . 
  i may be childish but i really think that the reason why the us is involved that syrian clusterfuck war is because they want to see that [ gas pipeline from qatar to turkey built ] ( http://www.mintpressnews.com/migrant-crisis-syria-war-fueled-by-competing-gas-pipelines/209294/ ) . 
  and the reason why russia is also in that is the exact opposite : they want to keep their gas-exporting supremacy over europe . 
  ( keep in mind this is my point of view , and i do n't want to convince anybody about that ) . 
  by the way , we europeans would still keep paying the same price ( or maybe more ) for that gas , so why would we care ? 
  russia had reasons to attack ukraine which i do n't really care to discuss , but can anybody explain to me why would russia threaten to attack europe ( and as europe i 'm referring to the 28 member states ) ? 
  well at least it would give a meaning to all of those guys dead and the 2 trillion dollars spent on the last war . 
  if you see it as a war for `` freedom and democracy '' , it was an utter failure . 
  so ukraine is now part of the eu ? 
  did n't know ... 
   china like russia , threatens those countries with a similar system of government and values china and russia , * like the us * , threaten those countries that have valuable resources and that are not able to properly fight back . 
  i thought that all of this `` we 're the good guys '' excuse was already over . 
  apart from the fact that there is no actual need to have an historical background for secession , i was just stating where lega nord took its roots . 
  i could n't agree with you more about nobody giving a fuck . 
  with all the economic interests russia has in europe , it 's very unlikely it would make any kind of threat to it . 
  anyway , more soldiers in the us bases means more money to all the buisnesses around it , so ... i 'm fine with it . 
  not really , no, 
  lega nord takes its lineage from the union of [ lega lombarda e veronese ] ( http://www.vittorininet.it/supporto/multimedia/comunimedievali/cartina2.jpg ) . 
  the `` whole north '' shares some common history and has been a more than real entity during the war against the hre . 
  this `` second sharia society '' issue can not be controlled by the law . 
  muslims will do it with or without the approval of western restrictions . 
  banning sharia courts is not the point . 
  make muslims stop to appeal to it is the point . 
  educate them with western values and send away the integralists is the point . 
  it says in the article that many muslim women feel the need to get a religious divorce , after the legal one . 
  c ) take the kid to a court of demented old people who , according to `` laws '' written by some other dude 2000 years ago , declares the kid guilty and unworthy . 
  i 'll take it as a compliment . 
  [ although we 're not so ill-equipped in the `` war '' department at the moment . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_military_expenditures ), 
  have you ever been to pompeii ? 
  15 y.o. 
  me loved that place . 
  given that turkey knows where its fucking air space ends, 
  i think it 's supposed to make the inhabitants feel protected more than anything else . 
  well he may not be from our nation , but he sure is from our country , as he was born in rome . 
  besides , why greeks can claim pericles as their own , macedons alexander , or mongolians gengis khan and we can not claim our roman ancestors ? 
  the [ roman * provincia italica * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_italy#augustan_organization ) has roughly the same borders we have now . 
  you may argue about traianus being italian , as he was born in spain , but it still would be a feeble argument . 
  good italy you 're not the last one for once . 
  have a cookie . 
  as an european myself , i disagree with the most of the things you listed . 
  i ca n't elaborate a counter-argument right now , but wanted to let you know it, 
  oh no now i want to know the real punchline !, 
  but ... but i love spanish people :(, 
  i 'd say much more than 50 %, 
  i do n't know why , actually . 
  ablative is the less used form , still 90 % of the italian words are almost the same as their latin ablative counterparts ( * pons * being a perfect example here , * recens * as well ) . 
  wondering who could be the `` foreigners '' on that upper left corner . 
  raiders from iceland maybe ? 
  a-hem actually it comes from the hablative `` ponte '' . 
  medieval latin used all the words in hablative form , because people were ignorant and did n't know how to properly decline words . 
  to get this reaction , i reckon somebody said they did n't * like * pasta at all ... 
  as a piedmontese myself , i have to disagree . 
  sicilian cuisine overshadows our bollito and fritto misto by a good measure . 
  but nobody beats us when we talk about wines . 
  i hope you do n't ask questions like this in everyday life then , because you really sound like a dick . 
  `` a couple '' my ass . 
   in students of hight school and universety get subsedised prices in theatre , museums ext. 
  that already happens in italy . 
   also why do we want our youth going to hevy metal concerts ? 
  there is a selected number of events for which the bonus can be used , you can not choose * any * concert you want . 
  presumably there wo n't be metal concerts in the cultural palette . 
   and why do you need money to go to a national park ? 
  i do n't know of national parks that have an entrance fee , but sometimes excursions or other kind of activities have a cost . 
  i suppose the bonus is for that . 
  i do n't know what you tried to prove , but you failed nonetheless, 
  `` finland starting the drills for snowball warfare in ten days '', 
  foreigners always say it like it is something to be ashamed of . 
  i do n't care , i like our system . 
  coming back from uni dead tired and find a hot plate of spaghetti with homemade pesto for dinner is good enough for me . 
   the leadership needs to manufacture crises to keep the general public from noticing how they 're being shafted . 
  is n't it what 's going on here in europe as well ? 
  `` look at those evil ruskis ! '', 
  i could pose you the same question . 
  why are so many people so naive to actually believe russia would want war with its most valuable trade partner ? 
  do n't get dragged away by the public acrithical hysteria . 
  russia stands no chance in an offensive war against the european union and putin knows it well . 
  that makes no sense at all . 
  the winter war started in another era , with different ideals and when expansionistic/colonial wars happened on a daily basis . 
  declaring war on finland would mean that all the nato countries would , to say the least , shut off commerce with russia , which would economically destroy it in a month or two . 
  it 's all hypothetical . 
  notice how all the phrases are `` would '' `` could '' `` may '' . 
  there 's no prove . 
  a serious newspaper reports things when it has proves that they 're really happening , otherwise it 's just propaganda . 
  you 're finnish . 
  tell me : what kind of resources has your country to offer that russia wants * so bad * that it would declare war on half the world to obtain it ? 
  because people believing in a russian invasion of finland are also stupid enough to believe that they would need to buy properties there . 
  `` i 'm planning on invading this country , but first , let me give it some money , for teh lulz '', 
  that 's better than helping the us killing civilians for their own gain . 
  but it 's even better than smiling at the us while jerking off putin under the table like your government is doing ... so shut up about consistency , because you really have none . 
   italia is absolutely known for its consistency germany had a non-aggression pact with the ussr and then stabbed its back attacking it during ww2 ... talk about consistency . 
  sorry , not going to accept * any * kind of shit regarding recent history coming from a german, 
  this is even worse than the `` google autocomplete '' data gathering . 
  anyway . 
  it was about time that my country would get the due recognition for its goddamned kiwi production , or mongolia for , you know , being best at * velociraptors * . 
  idiots in my city kept putting them on a single street lamp until it fell over .
