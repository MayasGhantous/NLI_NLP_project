they have families there . 
  why do n't steal their money then our military is stronger so obviously everything we do is acceptable . 
  the human traffickers did , you are basically admitting that you have the same moral of a human trafficker . 
  so let me get this straight you propose to abandon people in the middle of the sea on a sinking ship ? 
  because north african countries will obviously let you do that . 
  it 's not racist it 's just stupid . 
  [ amnesty : australian officials paid people smugglers ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/10/amnesty-australian-officials-paid-people-smugglers-151028230421588.html ), 
  [ not really ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/australian_immigration_detention_facilities#controversy ), 
  and if someone try to stop you ? 
  where they receive full medical attention with the ok of the local government unlike libya, 
  so if someone need urgent medical attention he should be left to die if i understand you right when you say you do n't care about them ? 
  so plese repeat to me what would you do if someone try to stop you and if there is some medical emergency . 
  you say drop them in a random port i explained why it is n't possible nor right and the you responded saying i want to help zimbabwean kids while never addressing my point . 
  so you admit you have no solution then ahahahah, 
  i will point out that you have n't addresed any one of them , while you are resorting to use slippery slope more and more . 
  serious objection are not fact but massive slippery slope are ? 
  australia put them in camp with awful condition in an isolated island in the pacific , we do not have similar island and we have much more migrants.do you have some actually realizable proposal ? 
  the inhabitants of the port ? 
  the local independent militia ? 
  and the children on board do they have responsabilites ? 
  what happen if someone need intense medical care ? 
  so you admit that your solution does n't make sense ? 
  who 's responsible does n't matter this is the reality of the situation . 
  so you take people and drop in some random port ? 
  and if someone try to stop you ? 
  if there is some medical emergency ? 
  and bring them to who ? 
  the non existing libyan government ? 
  you are right we should let the drown, 
  i 'm the only one who see the problem in giving the state the power of deciding what is culturally acceptable and what not ? 
  she is right again, 
  well she is right, 
  why do n't judge the individual then ? 
  well it 's not like eritrea is much better, 
  no because there were no proof at all, 
  because there is nothing to answer we do n't tm decide how many decide to get here, 
  a political choice rendered inevitable by economical reality, 
  many jew are going to germany instead [ http://zwst.org/cms/documents/383/de_de/zwst_mitgliederstatistik_1955-1985.pdf] ( http://zwst.org/cms/documents/383/de_de/zwst_mitgliederstatistik_1955-1985.pdf ), 
  yes until you have proof of the countrary i will, 
  i mean if they did n't recive welfare they would be forced to resort to crime, 
  i mean this happened only 3 months ago [ thirty nine year old gay man attacked on a train in berlin , the attackers were polish . 
  is purposefully exaggerating the number until its in realistic and stop having sense, 
  it 's impossible for such number of african refugee to go to germany beacause there are n't so many refugee and the large majority of them stay in africa, 
  even if we did n't help them they will simply try to reach the coast, 
  but are n't violent crimes diminishing in western europe ? 
  yes and ? 
  fuck other people if they do n't come here ? 
  patrolling a border cost much more manpower than simply let them come here by plaine with their papers already checked , and your solution still ignore tha non-enforciability of a closed sea border, 
  why people alwais exagerate when i explain the reality of the situation alwais `` you obviously want gorillions of people to come to europe2 always the same exagerated bullshit, 
  the traffickers will simply use better boat and try to reach the coast like they did before , probably more dead because a longer crossing means more risk, 
  yes risk killing thousand people for the lulz, 
  it 's not that he did n't have enough proof he literally did n't have any, 
  i mean lybia ports are surely not safe, 
  you are just saying some mulsim want to conquer the west you must proof that all muslim immigrating to the west want that it 's a much more difficult thing to prove i must say, 
  putting them in camp with terrible conditions and them try to hide that by banning journalist ? 
  we barely have 18 % of all world refugee while being one of the richest part of the globe, 
  yes clearly refugee and the ottoman empire are the same thing lol, 
  so you have no proof that a plan exist or that migrant come to europe to act that way ? 
  s how can you say that muslim adhere to declaration of those so called islamics leader ? 
  are you saying that all muslim are terrorist and follow their plan ? 
  `` islamic leaders '' prove that you do n't know a shit about islam it dose n't have a unified clergy , `` terorist '' is not a good source to know what would people do and i really really want you to point to the part of the koran where there is a detailed plan for the colonization of europe or proof of the existance of this mythic no-go zone, 
  i still do n't see armed man forcing me in reservation , panting refugee but even migrant as a foreign army with intent of conquest is stupid at best, 
  well i welcome them so it 's not unwelcome,

  but the number of illegals coming from mexico ad been deceiving for decades, 
  i 'm waiting, 
  are you seeing armed muslims troop forcing christian kids in madras ? 
  lol, 
  like 20 % of israel population is arab muslim lol, 
  i mean you made the original claim that it was an invasion present you your proof, 
  i mean you consider their immigration policies good and the rest bad only beacuse you like the immigration one and not the other , it 's not an objective position for example i consider all their postition bad on immigration and in other subject, 
  so your solution dose n't work ? 
  at least mine would save thousand of life and cost many less resource, 
  so the position ** you ** like are n't nutcase but those you do n't are ? 
  is n't it a bit egocentric ? 
  well but how would a wall help people with legitimate cliam to asylium ? 
  or people who quite easily climb over the wall ? 
  and how do you propose to build a wall in the middle of the mediterranean sea ? 
  yes fuck human rigths lol, 
  well you 're analysis is wrong our standard for asylium are rather stric and even then i do n't known how you can think that all of africa population will come here, 
  well yes it takes year but following my idea we will reduce significatl the people arriving and with more resource ( by having to handle less people ) it should be much easier ; and there are way to know from were a person come even without document for example by the languge they speak, 
  the didd n't choose to stay in lybia they ** must ** pass througt lybia to get here and please inform yourself the civil war is far from over tha country is still divided in vaious territory controlled by 2 different government but in reality very autonomus, 
  yes but the problem is what is the populus , populist politician say that the people are with him but how we can say it 's true ? 
  should n't the fact that they continue to lose election prove otherwise ? 
  i 'm sorry if i offended you i did n't know you too faced similar opprssion and violation of human rigth in you daily life, 
  the influx by boat like i said the statistic ca n't show that, 
  yes but what you know of the opinio of the average joe ? 
  how can you be so sure it is in accord with you , and event then `` these people '' are many times people of the same country so the are part of the populace too, 
  yes but why ? 
  i mean you surely do n't know even 0,001 % of all european citzien personally why must they be valued more ? 
  thaks i prefer to not change human righths they are part of the european value that many here think must be defended, 
  maybe beacuse that position ** is ** nutcase firebrand ? 
  i mean with do n't have dictators and similar shit because we respect human rigth and one of these human rigth is the rigth to asylium, 
  well yes but if they have limited resource is the most logical choice, 
  so data and expert are useless and we should base every political decision on personal feeling ? 
  so feels  real, 
  no the famili do n't take the same path they come by plane once the asylium claim is accepted, 
  it 's not the same trip if they accept the asylium claim they can safely come by plane, 
  the fist if the man complete the crossing they are safe if the do n't the can send the other man in the family , and you must consider tha many time young man are focefully conscipted in militia so taking the crossing is a way to escape that,
