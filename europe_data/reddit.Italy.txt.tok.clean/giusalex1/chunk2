  do you have a source ? 
  so whats the difference ? 
  well i 'm speaking for the country who would sign the accord for those who will not the solution is the same economic sanction and diplotic pressure until they accept . 
  and if they `` loose '' their passport ? 
  the same we do know follow the legal process and investigate their origin but with many less people to handle and so with a speedier process, 
  well yes to prevent a crime you have to have proof that a crime exist, 
  i think it should take people that make an asiylium claim in an embassy or on it 's territory that is ruled true under after an investigation, 
  are you saying that the starting situation of poland and guinea were the same and they faced similar ways of occupation ? 
  man it 's rather sad, 
  i mean why should i trust you on the opinion of the average citzien ? 
  only because you have an opinion dose n't mean everyone is in accord with you and the election prove just that, 
  small in what ? 
  we are clearly more rich and have more resource with wich take care of them, 
  first if they are ngo by definition they are n't a business second i do n't know how saving people from drowing harm asylium seekers, 
  well you proposed to stop doing that, 
  are you really comparing youre situation with people oppressed in guinea ? 
  i mean not to offend i do n't know you 're personal experiece, 
  oh jesus i 'm dealing with one of you `` only white people are really people '' lot . 
  i 'm open to engaging further, 
  no we take 17 % of all the refugee worldwide, 
  so you 're morality extend to only european geographic limits ? 
  well reciving asylium by embassy is more improbable and take more time than taking the dinghy if i was oppressed or in fear of my life i would easily take the second option . 
  but in general i 'm in accord with you , asking and reciveng asylium in an embassy should be made easier and faster, 
  so spaniards are ** our ** people but others are not ? 
  why ? 
  and with the video what is exactly the problem ? 
  are there to many brown people for your taste ? 
  well yes in france , netherland and austria the populist opposition lost, 
  well is easy for you to say you do n't live in similar condition, 
  well if it 's more probable for me to survive and we have limited resource and by succeding i can take them here safely , well yes it 's the most rationale choice, 
  by subjecting them to the standard asylium claim process and we have to take because the rigth to asylium is enshrined in europen law, 
  i do n't know iff all of them are refugee but without investigating their claim how could we know ? 
  only 17 % off all refugee worldwide are in europe [ http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html] ( http://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html ), 
  subjective experience is no good basis to build policy i trust expert and data dirven policy more, 
  well no like i said before you do n't have to come from a country in war to have a legitemely claim to asylium, 
  why seriosly why ? 
  we still take a tiny percentage of refugee worldwide if some of them come to us whats the problem ? 
  well i colud talk of european value and common morality but it 's clear you do n't care about that, 
  but young men are the most probable to complete the crossing alive, 
  take a look in the field of many field in the south and you will see you 're irregular migrant working, 
  and risk their life on a very dangerous journey ? 
  why it 's not like you actually have to be under fire to be oppressed, 
  well good luck pay with the clothing they own and proving they were aware of what would happen, 
  well with the year the family come by plane when the man recive the asylium status so obviosly this statistic ca n't show that, 
  i mean if you were prosecuted in guinea where you would prefer to claim asylium in mali ? 
  lol, 
  well they are doing it many of them immediatly ask for asylium when they land obvisly some of them are not legit but you ca n't know without investigating every case, 
  well if they make it the family can travel safely by plane probably and the cost of the crossing is rather steep it 's simply more logical, 
  i do n't understand why everytime i call someone on they error they alwais rely on exageration like europe taking all the poor in the world ? 
  is it a bit of a dumb move we clearly arent we actually take a small percentage of refugee worldwide, 
  have you considered you cold be the naive one ? 
  it 's obviously not against european wishes if party against it continue to lose, 
  well le pen lost, 
  i mean far rigth party continue to lose it 's obvious european are not saying no lol, 
  i mean they surely have better data and people with better qualification than you, 
  i mean i like it so i do n't understand why do you speak in my name, 
  i mean it 's probable they have more qualification on the subject than you ? 
  it 's not like there are n't legitimate reason to escape from there and claim asylium [ human rights in guinea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_in_guinea ), 
  i mean the fact that people of bangladesh are using it dose n't mean that the other are not possible refugee , and even then you do n't actually have to come from a warzone to be refugee you just have to be persecuted , and even more the refugee allocated to poland would probably be all syrians, 
  i mean if you as a family wanted someone to take the crossing who would you send ? 
  obviously the young man, 
  some of them do go back and there are many economist that agree that immigration is good for the economy . 
  if we have an accord with the origin country repatriating the one who do n't have secrity reason for escaping would be much easier and we will have to handle many less people ; if you can come safily by plane why risking thousand of money and your life by coming by boat ? 
  nobody is asking for that the number is not even remotely similar why everyone have to exageratee so much ? 
  everytime billion quadrillion gorillion , in europe we have a comparatevely minor percentage of all the refugee worldwide, 
  lol i 'm sure you have better understanding of history that some people with a degree . 
  are you asking if having proof of something is important to legally prosecute someone ? 
  lol, 
  from the little that i can understand from the google translation of the article the have very little political influence, 
  i mean children obviosly dose n't know and is simply to belive that many are not well informed of any of the condition of the travel ; refugee status is a human right everibody have the right to ask for it, 
  yes it automatic death penalty for people that have n't done no harm, 
  yes but many stays and work i know many who work were i live . 
  well they can surely make more with the infrastracture and stable istituion we have of what they could made at home and then many help their home country develop by sending money home and taking with them knowledge and know-how when they come back, 
  yes and the rational way is to make legally migrating easier, 
  so if you saw a man helpless on the road after a an accident he caused you would let him die ? 
  and even then it 's probable many of them dose n't know what will happen certanly not children, 
  it 's not if there are n't more realistic solution that do n't comrend letting thousand die horrible death, 
  well a larger percentage of them dided during crossing back then it was n't really a better situation even before, 
  or they want to save people, 
  anf if they did n't help them some of them would drown and thay then would disembrak on shore like they did before solving nothing, 
  i think these number are way of tha number of african migrants in europe is not even in the ten of millions, 
  my suggestion is to find accord with nation of origin of economic migrant and make legally migrating from these lace much easier this way nobody other than refugee would ever come by boat, 
  and if a wall could bebuilt in italy they would start passing by a path with less control and so on , migration in a global economic system is to be expected, 
  it still dosent seem a good justification for letting thousand drown, 
  but they do n't work in fact many people are still coming, 
  well youd od n't seem fazed by the possible death of thousand of peoples and your ready to consider their death acceptable so i do n't know what to say really, 
  yes but there are no proof that this ever happened and even then if the ongs do n't know the origin of the money how could they be responsible ? 
  ** some of them ** are unhappy about ** some part ** of the treatment they recive it 's quite different from saying a large majority of them dose n't want to stay, 
  so if i were to kill you or your family you wo n't have problem with it i mean you are animal by your admission , i should n't have problem doing it ? 
  they will simply reach the shore like they did years before, 
  in the sense that you shift the problem to other people yes , if it was possible and you walled the entire border they will simply climb over it or find other way in it 's simply economics, 
  you ca n't move them to place were thir safety is no guarenteed and in case of medical emergency you still have to take them to hospital, 
  yes comparing people to animal will surely help keeping your conscience clean, 
  they are paid by willingly donors like me and their budget are public by law, 
  so let them drown ? 
  yes but still the border are n't really open immigrating legally from many of these country in europe is rather difficult, 
  yes beacuse there were other way in , migrants follow the path of least resistance obviously, 
  are you suggesting that was the reaction of romans ? 
  lol, 
  man it 's really realy stupid to even compare similar things just the idea of confronting the roman empire with modern europe is idiotic .
