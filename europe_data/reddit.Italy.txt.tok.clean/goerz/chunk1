so beautiful , it could have easily rivalled prague or vienna . 
  http://www.inflation.eu/inflation-rates/italy/historic-inflation/cpi-inflation-italy.aspx since 1996 , about the same as after the euro . 
  in the early '90s it was around 4-5 % . 
  nobody complains about deflation here . 
  only taxes and inflation . 
  we only convert the price into the old currency when blaming the euro for the price increases . 
  let me rephrase that for you : berlusconi ** allegedly ** called angela merkel an unfuckable lard-ass ** in a private conversation ** . 
  this is very different from what the czech president did in a public radio address . 
  it would have an impact on everyone , not just the banks . 
  hundreds of thousands of civil servants , police , doctors , etc. 
  would be without pay . 
  all payments from the public sector would stop , internal demand would collapse and , since italy should also get out of the euro , all imported goods , especially oil and gas , would become very expensive . 
  brb going to withdraw all my savings from the bank . 
  i once took the [ fl\u00e5m railway ] ( http://www.lonelyplanet.com/norway/oslo/travel-tips-and-articles/76243 ) from bergen and it was well worth it . 
  i live next to the slovenian border . 
  they do n't teach us slovenian in italian schools , if you want to learn it you need to attend a school where all the activities are carried out in slovenian , which is not an option if you do n't already speak slovenian at home . 
  in the last years italian families have begun sending their children to slovenian-speaking kindergartens ( to the dismay of slovenian parents , who see their schools overflown with children who do n't speak slovenian ) , but the kids usually forget the slovenian language once they grow up . 
  this lack of slovenian language courses is a deliberate policy that keeps the two ethnicities separated . 
  it also gives the slovenian minority in italy the monopoly on the slovenian language , and thus a competitive advantage when accessing jobs for which being bilingual is a requirement . 
  i can walk into slovenia from my house . 
  for me peculiarities mainly involve the selective shopping ( e.g. 
  groceries , gasoline and tobacco in slovenia , clothes in italy ) , and the possibility of eating out much more often than i normally could in italy , because of the ample selection of affordable restaurants in slovenia . 
  we do n't really care of how you say `` calcio '' in english . 
  over the span of several years : new york , washington dc , philadelphia , amish country in pennsylvania , boston , los angeles , san francisco , las vegas , new orleans , denver , other smaller cities ( grand junction , moab , a village on a bayou in louisiana , and others i do n't remember . . ) , and several parks : monument valley , grand canyon , arches , zion , bryce , natural bridges , mesa verde , rocky mountain , colorado state monument ... 
  agreed . 
  5 trips to the us so far , and counting . 
  wine is cheaper than water here , 
  there are no restrictions of any kind on alcoholic beverages in italian universities . 
  the comments are civilized in comparison to what 's going on in some italian facebook groups . 
  i read it on the rai ( italy 's national broadcaster ) website , but i could n't find any source in english other than the one i posted . 
  i got lost in the woods in the alps once , to find my way out i followed a stream that i knew would have led me to my destination , eventually . 
  no big deal . 
  surprised ? 
  you can have great food everywhere in europe ( and elsewhere ) , but i 'm partial to italian cuisine , for its variety ( if you think we only eat pasta and pizza , think again ) and affordability . 
  i think that sicily has one of the most interesting cuisines in italy . 
  austria : when i see bell towers with [ onion-shaped roofs ] ( http://us.123rf.com/450wm/buurserstraat386/buurserstraat3861209/buurserstraat386120900001/15238847-a-typical-austrian-church-bell-tower-with-onion-shaped-roof.jpg ) i feel at home . 
  lol, 
  why ? 
  because of the crowds ? 
  `` mestre '' and `` lovely '' are two words that i did n't think could be included in the same sentence . 
  i do n't know avramopoulos , i hope he 'll do better than malmstr\u00f6m , who is still there , but at least she 's been moved from home affairs to trade . 
  i 've just found out that my leaf blower uses 2500w . 
  i think i 'm going to use it more sparingly from now on . 
  i love colorado , i 'd settle nicely there . 
  according to the article , 100,000 immigrants landed in italy in 2014 only , a number that well exceeds the capacity of italy 's detention centers . 
  many immigrants manage to escape controls and reach other european countries . 
  if this trend continues , i think border controls within the eu will be reinstated soon . 
  when i 'm abroad i always identify as italian . 
  north-eastern italy , close to austria and slovenia . 
  [ am i late to the party ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3hkjcxl.png ) i 've just realized that i probably have seen more of the us than of europe . 
  the importance of the battle of the teutoburg forest has been overplayed by german nationalists since the 19th century . 
  the germans were massacred by the legions in several instances in the centuries that followed the battle , often in short-range incursions over the border aimed at keeping the local germanic population under control , although no attempt to extend the roman empire over the rhine was attempted . 
  according to the british historian peter heather , the rhine was a much more practical boundary for the roman empire than any other river in germania . 
  arminius , the germanic leader at the battle of teutoburg , was eventually defeated , and rome tried to control germania east of the rhine and north of the danube indirectly , by appointing client kings . 
  my credit cards have a chip , but i 'm never requested to enter a pin in italy , i just sign . 
  i also remember signing my credit card receipts in london last year . 
  it looks like i 'd better find out what my pin numbers are . 
  in which countries is this the norm ? 
  polito is n't the only university in italy . 
  other universities have introduced degrees taught entirely in english , without much drama . 
  centesimi , often shortened to cent . 
  indeed : [ quietly , and rather politely , britain is getting a gun lobby ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21602236-quietly-and-rather-politely-britain-getting-gun-lobby-armed-robbery?fsrc=scn/fb/wl/pe/armedrobbery ) . 
  there 's no language all of us understand in europe . 
  [ what makes you think that people watch american movies and tv series in english ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nzwzythsni ), 
   yes they do . 
  not as many as in the us , but that is just a blatant lie . 
  for some reasons , british media often ignore the fact that not all european countries have adopted the same draconian gun laws they have in the uk . 
  having said that , us media do have an influence in terms of gun culture here : those who own a .44 magnum revolver usually do it because of the dirty harry movies , pump-action shotguns are usually bought by people who grew up playing first-person shooters , etc. 
  and i 've seen more guns in the italian tv series `` romanzo criminale '' than in any american movie !, 
  the part about kids pretending to play guns is just preposterous , though . 
   can it have something to do with the fact that everybody understands english , and that the market for english language media is a lot bigger than for other european languages ? 
  this does n't explain the success of american movies and tv series in those european countries where all media are dubbed in the local language . 
  it 's a lot of money , but you 're giving your children an extra opportunity in life . 
  i 'd do the same for my children , if i could give them us citizenship . 
  the few times i had to report a minor crime , i went to the carabinieri because their office hours are longer ( their stations are usually open till late in the night , because they live there ) , and because i felt like it . 
  in small towns and rural areas only the carabinieri are present , but in larger towns you can actually choose between the two . 
  carabinieri and polizia are often in competition with each other . 
  i 'd choose , among the topics that are closer to your interests , the class that requires the most effort . 
  this way you 'll learn how to study and you 'll be ready to take university-level courses , even if you change the field of study . 
  the detention camps are overflowing and there are newspaper reports about the immigrant being allowed to leave . 
  a friend of mine is military police and he was sent to guard one of these camps once and he told me they received orders not to stop them if they wanted to leave . 
  most of them want to go to france or germany . 
  if you think that all those immigrants are staying in italy , think again . 
  they are just too many to handle for the small coastal villages in sicily , so the authorities are quietly letting them go . 
  i usually buy the 1-year vignette for slovenia ( i live nearby ) , but a 1-day vignette for tourists would be nice . 
  it 's expensive , but not slower : frequent users have a remote paying device . 
  but i was referring to the fact that there 's no short-term vignette ( 1 day ) for tourist just passing by . 
  i hate vignettes so much , they 're designed to screw the tourist . 
  i agree . 
  i probably just replied to the wrong comment , 
  sometimes there are people like this . 
  i remember a photographer from my hometown who claimed in the '80s that the virgin mary appeared to him on the shores of a river . 
  he managed to gather some followers and i believe they even built a small chapel in the place where this `` miracle '' happened . 
  but i 'm not aware of anyone currently having national fame for things like these . 
  in italy covering your face in public is forbidden by law ( carnevale and halloween are exceptions ) . 
  did n't know about the song . 
  lol , you 're right with `` dixi ''  `` ragazze '' is indeed correct in italian , but in the dialect spoken in trieste they 're called `` mule '' .
