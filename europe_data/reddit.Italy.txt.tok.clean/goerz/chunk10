  his death caused grief and consternation in the whole europe , but the promise to ban firearms from the battlefields because of their cruelty was not maintained . 
  guess i should move to poland then . 
  i found out i know nothing of those ep political groups . 
  nowhere and never in italy is still daylight at 11pm , maybe your 're thinking of the arctic circle . 
  what about the husband of a doctor , or of a mayor ? 
  would he be called `` herr doktorin '' or `` herr b\u00fcrgermeisterin '' ? 
  we have it in italy too . 
  we have guns in europe too . 
  i certainly do . 
  the map seems legit , but the ethnic group labels do n't , and should be taken with a grain of salt . 
  the y-dna distribution in europe however is well known ; see for example this [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_history_of_europe ) on the genetic history of europe , that relies on the studies of cavalli-sforza and other reputable scientists . 
  the map also shows all northern italy annexed to germany after the 1943 armistice , while in reality hitler reinstated mussolini as head of the repubblica sociale italiana , arguably a puppet state , but still formally separated from germany . 
  the only areas annexed to the third reich were the alpenvorland ( s\u00fcditrol , trentino , and belluno ) and the adriatisches k\u00fcstenland ( gorizia , trieste , istria and dalmatia ) . 
  ... and about the double-entry bookkeeping system . 
  from what i gather , yes , finland has been relatively isolated in genetic terms during its history , and the genetic markers of finland 's population have been extensively studied for this very reason . 
  r1a1a : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:r1a1a_distribution.png, 
  i would n't give too much credit to the ethnic groups labels reported in the map : they may indicate where the different haplogroups are prevalent today , but nothing more . 
  ethnic groups are genetically mixed , and have been for thousands of years : have a look at this table : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/y-dna_haplogroups_by_ethnic_group, 
  i wonder what the next 1000 years will look like . 
  only a genetic test could tell . 
  for example : https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/, 
  people belonging to the same y-dna haplogroup descend from the same male ancestor ( they are genetic `` cousins '' ) , who lived tens of thousands of years ago . 
  y-dna markers are only transmitted from father to son ; the different haplogroups represent different mutation in the dna . 
  the map you are looking at is helpful for understanding human prehistoric migrations in europe . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_y-chromosome_dna_haplogroup http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_history_of_europe, 
  haplogroup distribution in europe precedes by many thousands of years the formation of ethnic groups as we know them today . 
  i 'm r1a `` carpathian cluster '' , according to the genographic test i took . 
  i also have a surname of germanic origins , so i guess my paternal line came to italy during one of the barbarian invasions , possibly with the langobards . 
  they should be detained and deported . 
  it 's amazing to think that humans were already in great britain 40,000 years ago , before or during the ice age . 
  then they were pushed south by the advancing glaciers , but eventually , when the ice retreated , they went back , 25,000 years later . 
  [ emanuele filiberto di savoia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emanuele_filiberto,_prince_of_venice_and_piedmont ) , heir of the last king of italy , is a tv star . 
  i did n't realize there were so many supermarket enthusiasts out there . 
  since you are curious , here 's the [ history of cooperative operative di trieste , istria e friuli , founded in trieste in 1903 ] ( http://www.coopts.it/identita/storia.html ) . 
  the one i have here is locally owned . 
  famila ( selex ) , interspar , coop ( a local chain ) . 
  lidl for detergents and other home cleaning products . 
  i d\u00f2n ' t know , i sho\u00f9ld ch\u00e9ck whether w\u00e8 act\u00f9ally have a sm\u00e0ller \u00e0lphab\u00e8t than the engl\u00ecsh language .

  the device and services division of nokia has been generating losses for three years now , and this certainly had an impact in the determination of the selling price . 
  i 'm not sure i get your point , but i was referring to my direct paternal line . 
  usa , for a semester during my phd . 
  in my case , the growth has been of 25cm in little more than a century : great-great-grandfather ( born 1865 ) : 165cm . 
  great-grandfather ( born 1895 ) : 167cm . 
  grandfather ( born 1922 ) : 174cm . 
  father ( born 1945 ) : 180cm . 
  same in italy : the hotels send your data to the police . 
  anti-terrorism law from the '70s . 
  i should have said contemporary architecture . 
  i can walk into slovenia from my home in italy . 
  during slovenia 's short war of independence in 1991 , i could hear gunshots and explosions from my house . 
  i do most of my shopping there : food , fuel , clothing , etc. 
  i even bought my car there , and i have it serviced regularly . 
  slovenia is currently suffering an economic crisis , its major banks are in trouble and unemployment is a serious problem . 
  slovenia resembles austria in its order and efficiency . 
  slovenians often complain about their ruling elite , but i think this is a tract not exclusive to them . 
  ugly modern architecture . 
  the map only reports haplotype i. 
  is this a y-dna haplotype ? 
  if so , the map hardly measures race . 
  indeed i can only speak for the north . 
  i 've never tried it , but i was told it is a medium quality wine . 
  it 's common in wine shops around italy . 
  the [ white cross in the red shield ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/flag_of_italy_%281861-1946%29_crowned.svg ) is the symbol of the savoia , italy 's royal family from 1861 to 1946 . 
  it was removed from the flag in 1946 . 
  we also have two variants for maritime use , which both include the four flags of the main italian [ maritime republics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maritime_republics ) of the middle age ( venice , genoa , pisa , and amalfi ) . 
  [ this one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/civil_ensign_of_italy.svg ) is used by civilian ships , while [ this other one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/naval_ensign_of_italy.svg ) is used by the italian navy ( marina militare ) . 
  note how , in the civilian flag , st. mark 's winged lion , the symbol of venice , is showing an open book , that always reads in latin ( not in the flag though ) : `` pax tibi marce , evangelista meus '' ( peace to you mark , my evangelist ) . 
  the military flag instead has a lion placing his foot on a closed book , and wielding a sword . 
  this iconography follows the old venetian tradition of placing a sculpture of a lion in such a pose over the entrance of military outposts . 
  the venetians in fact did n't think it was appropriate to show the word `` pax '' to their enemies . 
  i did n't realize italian authorities were performing police activities in albania . 
  the left ( democratic party ) is terrified by the idea of new elections . 
  moreover , new coalitions seem unlikely , given the unwillingness of grillo 's `` 5 stars '' party to form any alliance with either the democratic party or berlusconi 's people of freedom party . 
  what credibility ? 
  i do n't understand either , but you ca n't deny that there are some who would probably keep voting for him even after his death . 
  i 'm not sure silvio berlusconi would want her daughter marina to hold such a prominent position in the party , exposed to the attacks of the judiciary : it would put their media empire at risk . 
  also , she lacks her father 's charisma . 
  i agree , the fact that the tourist was american is not that important . 
  they should have highlighted instead how fragile and endangered our artistic heritage is . 
  some newspapers tried to play the `` ugly american '' card claiming that said tourist was intent to `` high five '' the 700-year old statue , but i have n't found any proof of this in the newsreels . 
  of course , but the authorities probably have some estimations of the number of illegal immigrants , that 's why i was wondering whether they were included in the numbers reported on the map . 
  do the percentages also include illegal immigrants ? 
  they are just a few ( only 3 currently , over an assembly of 315 senators , other 3 died recently ) , and they are normally nominated at a very advanced age ( monti is an exception ) . 
  they rarely make a difference , although in some cases their votes are important when margins are thin . 
  they are sometimes toughtful enough not to vote in some delicate matters , recognizing their quasi-ceremonial role , but not always . 
  the senate is italy 's upper house of the parliament . 
  a senator for life is a permanent member of this assembly , with the same rights as any other senator . 
  the president of the republic has the power to appoint senators for life persons who distinguished themselves in several fields ( scientists , industrialists , etc. ) . 
  all former presidents of the republic are senators for life by right . 
  monti was appointed just before he was named prime minister , allegedly as a condition he posed to accept the job . 
  in case you did n't know , the original teflon don was the american mobster john gotti . 
  monti was never liked by italians , and he resents this . 
  he currently is a senator for life , and leads a small party that performed poorly at the last elections . 
  i think that the causes for his downfall are to be found in both the reasons you mentioned : he increased taxes , but did n't manage to improve the country 's competitiveness or to hit out at the many powerful lobbies we have . 
  at last an informed article about berlusconi , after all that `` teflon don '' bullshit . 
  impressive . 
  can you just get the meaning even without knowing the friulan language , or were you already familiar with the lyrics ? 
  for those who are interested , it 's the beginning of a song in friulan called `` stelutis alpinis '' ( lit . 
  the edelweiss flowers .
