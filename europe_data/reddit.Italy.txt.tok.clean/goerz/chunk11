  if you come up here in the mountains where they buried me there is a place full of edelweiss flowers : it was drenched in my blood . 
  who knows where attila 's descendants are ? 
  it 'd be fascinating to find out . 
  the [ hungarian invasions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_invasions_of_europe ) in northern italy in the 10th century led to the depopulation of the countryside , as people took refuge in fortified cities . 
  * known as pannonia in ancient times . 
  * their language is not indo-european , but ugro-finnic , brought by a population that arrived in hungary in the 8th or 9th century ad . 
  the genetic make-up of modern-day hungarians , however , is not different from that of their neighbors , meaning that the new rulers where an elite that imposed their customs on a larger pre-existing population ( not unlike the romans used to do , btw ) . 
  * attila is a common given name , and i gather that attila the hun is considered a national hero in hungary . 
  this leaves italians ( i ca n't tell for other nationalities ) perplexed , because they are still taught in school that attila was `` the scourge of god '' , an arch-villain whose name was incorporated in scary folktales up to the late 19th century . 
  * goulash is hungary 's best known dish and it is served in restaurants throughout the former austro-hungarian empire . 
  * budapest is europe 's porn capital . 
  who says we are young and tech-savvy ? 
  i am neither . 
  anyway , i used pgp to encrypt my email in the late '90s , but the only other person i knew who shared my interest in encryption was my brother , and we did n't have much to say to each other . 
  so i gave up . 
  i think that whoever was presidente del consiglio dei ministri ( prime minister ) has the right to be called `` presidente '' for the rest of their life . 
  they sometimes address d'alema the same way . 
  i own a leaf-blower , but i use it in reverse , as a vacuum cleaner ( leaves are sucked into a bag ) . 
  it 's easier than raking . 
  my impression is that the eu actively tries to be as boring as possible in everything it does . 
  logos , ads , communication in general : it all seems designed to bore you to death . 
  not really . 
  italian americans still celebrate columbus day . 
  and yet we still have so many streets and piazzas in our cities named after this butcher . 
  only recently the city of udine ( where cadorna 's headquarters where comfortably located during the war ) decided to rename a street that was named after him . 
  an ancestor of mine was among the 100,000 pows who died of starvation because of italy 's policy not to send them any humanitarian help , while all the other countries took care of their prisoners abroad . 
  the leniency is in consideration of his old age . 
  but you should also consider that priebke is used as a political pawn by the extreme right , which has always attributed the final responsibility of the massacre ( in which priebke was involved ) to the resistance fighters who killed the 33 german soldiers , thus causing the german retaliation . 
  so he has several supporters that help him out , especially his lawyer . 
  yes , for the past week . 
  not a lot of shootings , really . 
  when mobsters kill each other , the news barely reports it . 
  homicides in the family , however , are reported with great emphasis , especially when women are killed . 
  the media have even coined a new term , `` femminicidio '' ( murder of a woman ) . 
  do you want something funny ?

  in italy i still use checks for large purchases (  $ 2000 ) , the last time a year ago , when i bought some furniture . 
  indeed we have very few black citizens . 
  no , i have a paper id card . 
  but i do have a smart card issued by the regional health service , that i can use to access some online services ( manage my doctor appointments , see the drugs i have bought , see my vaccinations , etc. 
  in italiano vuol dire `` penso che scrivano queste cose solo per rincretinire la gente '' , in inglese `` i think they write this stuff only to confound people '' . 
  good luck speaking english in italy . 
  this map shows the detention centers for illegal immigrants in italy : http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:cie_in_italia.svg as far as i know , only illegal immigrants are detained in these camps in italy ; they often revolt , setting fire to mattresses , etc. , and the revolts must be quelled by the police . 
  italy : i was aware that the quality of my english education at school was sub-standard , because my teachers ( all non-native speakers ) had an awful pronunciation and only taught us literature , so when i started college i decided to do something about it . 
  back then ( 1990 ) there were no dvds , no internet , no dual audio tracks on tv , so i subscribed to time magazine and started reading ( initially with the help of a dictionary ) . 
  moreover , there was a tv station broadcasting cnn newscasts late at night , so i took the habit of setting the timer on my video recorder and of reviewing the news the day after . 
  a few years later the first vhs tapes with english language movies ( with english subtitles ) appeared , for educational purposes only : every single movie and tv show was and still is entirely dubbed into italian . 
  i bought and watched about 30 movies , but i still remember the first one i saw : `` scent of a woman '' , with al pacino . 
  the effort of watching these movies in the original language was so intense that i invariably ended up with a powerful headache . 
  then i bought the longman english grammar and i studied it cover to cover , discovering the nuances of the english verbal tenses ( for example , i did n't realize the english language had a subjunctive mood ) . 
  in the mid - '90s the internet arrived , and with it the first bbs and newsgroups ; thanks to them i learned a lot of colloquialisms that i could n't have otherwise known without actually travelling to an english speaking country . 
  my english language skills are now essential on my workplace and i benefited enormously from my fluency in reading and speaking english . 
  tl ; dr : i 'm self-taught, 
  * european commission , european parliament , and nato headquartered in brussels . 
  * they have an atom-shaped building . 
  * they speak french and ... dutch ? 
  * belgians seem to be the favourite butt of the joke for the dutch . 
  * chocolate , waffles , and trappist beer . 
  * they went on for more than a year without a government . 
  i 'd like to visit , eventually , i 'm particularly attracted by bruges and ghent . 
  i agree . 
  in italy the difference between `` rom '' or `` gypsies '' or `` nomads '' and romanians is very clear . 
  it changes that the title of this post has been incorrectly editorialized . 
   weapons , weapons everywhere . 
  unitil a couple of years ago there were seven gun shops in san marino , which is an overabundant supply for a country of just 25,000 people , even if you consider that hunting is popular in the area . 
  and then there are softair shops , crossbow shops , etc. 
  now several gun shops have closed , some because of the crisis , some others because they took italian gun laws too lightly and had to face legal consequences ( one owner was arrested at the beginning of the year when he entered italy ) . 
  no , i 'm arguing that bribing a policeman is as common in italy as it is in the uk . 
  shadow economy means hiring workers in black , or not getting an invoice from your plumber or your dentist ; it has nothing to do with bribing policemen . 
  the restaurant is actually very good . 
  `` ghetto '' is the name in italy for neighborhoods where the jewish population was confined during the night ( the original ghetto is in venice ) , and some neighborhoods bear this name even today . 
  funny , i 'm an average italian and i would n't know where to find this information either . 
  i 'm under the impression that your statement is not supported by any evidence , but it is just based on hearsay and prejudices . 
  * independent republic on a mountain ( mount titano ) overlooking the adriatic coast in italy . 
  * about 25,000 inhabitants . 
  as a non-citizen , you can get permanent residence only if you are hired by a local or open a business there and hire local residents . 
  * two captains elected every six months ~ ~ run the government ~ ~ are heads of state . 
  * italians go shopping there for electronics , cars , clothes , guns and fireworks . 
  in the past the price difference was substantial , now less so . 
  many shops have gone out of business in the last 5 years . 
  * fuel and tobacco prices are the same as in italy , thanks to an agreement with the italian government . 
  however , san marino citizens get an income tax rebate that offsets the higher excise taxes paid on such items . 
  * very low income tax . 
  they do n't have vat , but a `` monophase '' sales tax .
