  * plenty of banks , involved in shady business . 
  big money laundering center , but badly hit by several legal and judicial initiatives by italy . 
  * very popular with russian tourists . 
  * restaurants used to be great value for money , if you avoided the city center on top of the mountain . 
  nowadays the food is still great , but the prices have increased . 
  * all city center shops sell tourist crap . 
  only restaurant worth visiting in the center is `` ai lavoratori '' . 
  * they have weird museums ( e.g. , a torture museum ) , most seem tourist traps . 
  * they do n't have an airport and the country is landlocked , so you can only enter san marino by passing through italy . 
  * beautiful view from the top of mount titano . 
  the surroundings are very beautiful ( but they are in italy though ) . 
  here is a [ picture ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/14032658@n07/4508843881/in/set-72157620856914970 ) a took a couple of years ago * best day trip from san marino : [ fortress of san leo . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fortress_of_san_leo ), 
  is bribing policemen so common in the uk ? 
  weird . 
  no , thank you . 
  it is n't difficult getting to florence by train , high speed trains travelling to rome stop there . 
  maybe because they sell more cigarettes than rolling and pipe tobacco combined . 
  italy : i use an online bank , ing direct , and i do n't pay any fee for transferring money within the eu , nor for my bank account . 
  other banks would typically charge $ 1 for a transfer . 
  does n't he risk being arrested in germany if he speaks his mind ? 
  well , that puts everything in a different perspective . 
  thanks , i was n't thinking of this specific incident , but since you wrote that `` in france you do n't shoot at people '' , i thought that self-defense was n't recognized at all . 
  i 'm convinced that shooting someone in self defense is the second worst thing that can happen to you . 
  first is being killed by attacker . 
  is the concept of legitimate self-defense completely unrecognized by the french law ? 
  the title of the article is n't enticing , but the story is worth reading . 
  50 plainclothes cops storm a house in the middle of the night and put a woman and her 6-year old daughter on a private plane to kazakhstan , on request of that country 's oligarch . 
  yet finland is among the top in europe in the [ number of cars per capita ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_vehicles_per_capita ) . 
  i find it surprising that in a rich and prosperous place like finland cars are a luxury . 
  political correctness does n't exist in italy . 
  those who are racist or xenophobic are going to inform you directly of their positions on the matter . 
  ** italy ** nothing , i 'm on vacation . 
  well , i guess i can provide a short and incomplete report from the beach , after all : * italy 's high court ( cassazione ) is expected to issue a verdict on july 30 regarding one of berlusconi 's trials , involving tax fraud ( nothing to do with the rubygate trial ) . 
  this the third and last trial , so the verdict is going to be final . 
  berlusconi and his supporters claim that this has been handled at light speed by the court , in contrast with the usual sluggishness of italian justice . 
  a verdict has to been issued by september because of the statute of limitations , and in august italy essentially shuts down for vacations ( at least the courtrooms do ) . 
  in case of conviction , expect consequences on the letta government . 
  * an international intrigue involving kazakhstan has emerged : italy , on request of kazhak officials , repatriated the wife and daughter of a kazakh dissident , thus exposing them to risk of retaliation . 
  now the minister of the interior , alfano , who is berlusconi 's number 2 in his party , claims he was n't informed about the matter . 
  this is difficult to believe , and the opposition wants to see some heads rolling . 
  to put things in perspective , berlusconi is a good friend of the kazakh regime . 
  * senator roberto calderoli , an important representative of the anti-immigration party lega nord and vice-president of the senate , compared in a public speech the likes of the congolese-born minister for integration , kyenge , to those of an orangutan . 
  kyenge has been constantly under fire from the lega nord since proposing that the children of immigrants should be granted italian citizenship , if born in italy . 
  * a man in naples shot his daughter 's boyfriend because he did n't approve of their relationship . 
  i listen to fm radio every day , virgin radio for rock music and radio24 for financial news and politics . 
  italy this is my personal experience , may be outdated : emphasized : ancient romans , italian unification ( [ risorgimento ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_unification ) ) omitted : mussolini , fascism , wwii and beyond . 
  thanks , i stand corrected . 
  for reasons i can not completely fathom , i love denmark . 
  i had always dreamed to visit it , and when i married , i spent my honeymoon there . 
  no planning , my wife and i just drove all the way to denmark and toured the country for a dozen of days . 
  so the following could be a little biased . 
  * copenhagen has an interesting architecture , a lively compact city center , good shops and restaurants , and great museums . 
  it 's probably my favorite european capital . 
  but i think that tivoli gardens are overrated . 
  * outside copenhagen , i especially enjoyed ribe , aarhus , and skagen . 
  * skagen was famous in the 19th century for the brightness of its light , and it attracted many painters , who created the skagen school . 
  the most important is [ p.s. 
  i bought several prints of the skagen painters and they still hang in my home and in my office . 
  * in skagen you can observe [ two seas colliding ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biwjhyc-pye ) , the skagerrak and the kattegat , a rather unusual sight . 
  * the jutland coast is windy and it has moving sand dunes . 
  one famously buried an old church , so that only the belltower is now visible : [ the tilsandede kirke ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/den_tilsandede_kirke_i_skagen_2007_ubt.jpeg ) * famous danes include 17th century king christian iv , the philosopher kierkegaard , the author hans christian andersen , the physicist niels bohr , and the film director lars von trier . 
  edit : i forgot the 19th century sculptor thorvaldsen , the museum dedicated to him in copenhagen is impressive . 
  * egeskov castle is one of europe 's finest and best preserved fortified residences , and [ the setting is breathtaking ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/egeskov_slot_spejling_edit_2.jpg ) . 
  * helsing\u00f8r castle , of hamlet 's fame , is interesting but a little empty . 
  rosenborg castle and the royal treasure in copenhagen are also a must see . 
  * danish pipe makers are renowned for their craftsmanship , and their briar smoking pipes command premium prices . 
  * danish history is turbulent , and danish monarchs used to rule on norway , greenland , and part of sweden . 
  the dialect spoken in the swedish region of sk\u00e5ne is still closer to danish than to swedish . 
  denmark also had colonies in africa and possibly elsewhere . 
  * i had a danish friend once ; he does n't talk to me anymore and i do n't know why . 
  damn , i smoke and i 'm not thin , i must do it wrong . 
  it 's funny how the italians are at the same time the least active and the second thinnest population . 
  italy is actually less violent than the majority of european countries . 
  our newspapers however love to report crime news . 
  they could have solved the problem the italian way : issue them an id and send them to france and germany . 
  this would be the most sensible solution , but in reality nobody wants to be downsized and there 's a lot of resistance . 
   interesting . 
  how do people feel about this ? 
  i think that feelings are contradictory . 
  on one hand , there 's the clear perception that the provinces as administrative entities are too expensive , given the limited powers they have ; on the other hand , people do n't like to be grouped with their neighbors , given the centuries-old localism that is one of italy 's main characteristics . 
  in the past 20 years , however , the number of provinces has increased , with a duplication of structures ( electoral bodies , presidents , staffs , etc. ), 
  that many perceive as impossible to afford with today 's budget constrains . 
   did i understand the article correctly . 
  is the `` bouncer '' romanian-speaking as well ? 
  yes , the bouncer is a romanian-speaking churchgoer . 
  beggars in general are no problem , but in this case they are described as excessively aggressive . 
  ** italy ** * unemployment hit record high levels since 1977 : 12.2 % ( 38.5 % for 15-24-year old ) . 
  * according to british newspaper * the guardian * , italy is one of several european countries that helped the nsa collecting personal data . 
  the government has remained silent on the issue so far . 
  * the government is debating on how to remove imu , a property tax . 
  the abolition of imu on italians ' primary homes has been one of berlusconi 's most important electoral promises . 
  * a decree issued by the monti government in 2012 , regarding the regrouping of several of italy 's more than 100 `` provinces '' , in an effort to cut government spending , has been declared illegitimate by a high court . 
  the government then announced a constitutional reform to reduce the number of provinces .
