  you have a point . 
  i think that for english speaking people it 's different . 
  incidentally , i feel more at home in the usa than in the uk , because of america 's cultural influence . 
  the best way of feeling european is to travel outside of europe , and meeting other europeans . 
  then you realize that you have more in common with them than you 've ever thought . 
   the bells ring at noon to commemorate the siege of belgrade in 1456 , where john hunyadi defeated the ottomans . 
  a little-known fact is that the bells ring at noon every day in italy to commemorate the [ battle of lepanto ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_lepanto ) in 1571 , where a coalition of catholic states defeated an ottoman fleet . 
  * long history , played an important role in wwi in the disgregation of the austrian empire . 
  * strong cultural and political links with russia . 
  * within yugoslavia , serbia was the dominant entity . 
  * in the '90s serbia was famous for its war criminals . 
  milosevic was depicted in the western media as a sort of evil dictator , and serbia was perceived as just a step above other traditional `` rogue '' nations , such as iraq and north korea . 
  * the only european country so far bombed by nato planes . 
  * a rather known serb in italy is [ `` ivan the terrible '' ] ( http://tg24.sky.it/static/contentimages/original/sezioni/tg24/mondo/2010/10/13/ivan_serbia_italia_11.jpg ) , a hooligan who created havoc during a soccer match between italy and serbia in 2010 . 
  * according to an acquaintance of mine , who is very familiar with belgrade for business reasons , the city offers its best opportunities to lone male visitors . 
  that 's all , i admit i do n't know much about serbia . 
  italian , english , and french . 
  then there is a page with the translation of all terms in 22 other european languages . 
  i would n't trust this source , il fatto is garbage . 
  i understand them too , because of movies and tv . 
  but , apart from a few that are indeed common all over the nation , i definitely do n't see all of them used on a regular basis around me . 
  these gestures seem mostly specific to rome . 
  a branch of my family has originated from there and bears the name of a croatian island , krk ( cherso in italian ) . 
  croatia has a wonderful nature , both on the coast and in the inside . 
  i used to go with my parents to istria every sunday in the '80s to eat inexpensive seafood . 
  spent many summers there , including during the war years . 
  croatia 's currency is the kuna , but many people prefer to open bank accounts in euro . 
  beautiful villages ; the cities instead are sometimes a little grim . 
  great food , if you stay away from the large hotels on the coast . 
  kra\u0161 sweets dotted my childhood . 
  ice cream in croatia instead sucks ( imho ) . 
  i 'm going on vacation there this summer ( again ) . 
  i 'm so glad you joined , it really is an historic day .

  * new revelations about the kidnapping and murder of italian prime minister aldo moro in 1978 by the red brigades , a political terrorist organization : a member of the bomb squad who first arrived at the car containing the body of moro has just published a book where he states that the car was found an hour before the official phone call from the red brigades , and that the then minister of interior , francesco cossiga , arrived there well before the official chronicles of the day say .

  i 'm one of the few eccentrics that switch to english when watching dvds or satellite tv . 
  i 'm essentially self-taught . 
  i studied it in junior high school , and then for two years in high school , but i just learnt the grammar , and i did n't have a working knowledge of the language . 
  then at the university i decided i had to do something , so i subscribed to time magazine and started reading . 
  this was before the internet , and before we had dvds and satellite tv , so actually hearing spoken english in italy was close to impossible . 
  i now use english everyday on the workplace , written and spoken , and i am a fluent speaker ( at least that 's what native speakers tell me ) . 
  since i spent some time in the us , i have an american accent , and i still find british english more difficult to understand than american english . 
  i agree that it would be desirable , but unfortunately the reality is different . 
  i invite you not to make assumptions about other people 's opinions on the basis on their nationality . 
   i 'm pretty sure that all mep 's should speak and understand english . 
  that 's a highly unrealistic assumption . 
  it 's the address of the printer : 1749 venice st. , bologna . 
  no doubt about it . 
  1749 is not a year , it 's just part of the address of the printer , a certain manfredo manfredi , 1749 venice st. , bologna . 
  no , in italy we have 113 . 
  no idea , but the text says `` why is this nation , alone among others , almost despised ? 
  it is n't ignorant '' . 
  there is an excellent translation [ in this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1gw1sf/can_anyone_provide_some_historical_context_to_the/caojp99 ) . 
  no need to be a pretentious asshole , it 's all taken from corriere.it . 
  i did n't know tiramis\u00f9 was from treviso . 
  so deliciously unhealthy . 
  i 'm very well informed , to be honest . 
  i keep track of all the week 's crimes , but you are free to post interesting stuff , if you want . 
  it 's not like i 'm the official news anchor of r/europe . 
  and i forgot to mention that a `` carabiniere '' shot his wife with his ordnance handgun and then killed himself ... a few days ago i was surprised to learn , however , [ that the uk has a higher homicide rate than italy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate ) . 
  ** italy ** * german-born sport minister josefa idem , an olympic canoeist , went under fire when it emerged she did n't pay the property tax on one of her properties .

  * a city council member in padua , belonging to the anti-immigration party northern league , called for ms. kyenge , the congolese-born minister of integration , to be raped so that she could `` understand '' what victims felt .

  * the government is pondering whether increasing the vat tax from 21 % to 22 % , giving execution to a law introduced by the previous monti government . 
  berlusconi 's party , that is part of the government , is very vocal against any increase in taxes and it is threatening the survival of the government itself in case the vat rate is increased . 
  berlusconi claimed that the eu is `` powerless '' against italy even if we violate the stability pact .
