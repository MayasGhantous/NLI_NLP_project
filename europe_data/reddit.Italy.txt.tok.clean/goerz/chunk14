  * 77 persons involved in printing counterfeited euro notes were arrested . 
  * a landlord who evicted his tenant threatening him with a pistol was arrested near rome . 
  wonderful , i love it . 
  we eat it as a `` primo piatto '' ( first dish ) , instead of pasta , usually followed by a meat dish . 
  this dish originated from austria and it is known , with some variants , in several parts of central europe . 
  recipe ( in english ) : http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/mario-batali/plum-gnocchi-gnocchi-di-susine-recipe/index.html, 
  ** italy ** best : food , cities , art , history , natural landscapes ... quality of life in general worst : bureaucracy , inept politicians who write laws impossible to apply , vested interests that nobody seems willing to challenge , economic decline . 
  `` mula '' has the same meaning in italian it has in spanish ; only in the dialects of trieste and istria it means `` girl '' ( and `` mulo '' means boy ) . 
  it generates some funny misunderstandings with italians from other regions , 
  it 's a variant of venetian , it is spoken by the italian-speaking minority in istria . 
  it is also almost identical to the dialect spoken in trieste . 
  agree , but she does n't sing in spanish , she sings in istrian-venetian dialect ( my dialect btw ) . 
  `` la mula de parenzo '' ( the girl from pore\u010d ) is a classic in the trieste area : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fazo8ger_xu, 
  in northeastern italy : `` schei '' ( money ) is widely used in veneto , from the german word `` scheidem\u00fcnze '' , which was written on austrian coins . 
  `` bezzi '' is also used , it 's an old venetian coin . 
  then we have `` palanche '' , another old coin . 
  despite the euro , the old `` lira '' is still alive in some expressions ( i do n't have a lira , it 's not worth a lira , etc. . ) . 
  goran bregovic is also well known in italy . 
  not that many people in italy own guns , i read that it is just about 10-15 % of the population ( i 'm one of them ) . 
  the catholic church is a force to be reckoned with here . 
  i can only speak for italy : immigration , the economy , taxes , unemployment , stem cell research , gay marriage , immigration . 
  did i mention immigration already ? 
   i know that it does not sound well - due to environmental and traffic jam reasons our culture is moving away from cars , cars are not cool anymore really ? 
  i must be totally disconnected from the prevailing opinion then . 
  i drive everywhere . 
  usa = evil, 
  thank you , i 'll think i 'll go then !, 
  i 'll even get over the fact that i 'll have to pay the dreaded slovenian vinjeta ... 
  so , is the article truthful ? 
  after reading it , i 'm intrigued by the baroque festival in vara\u017edin , it seems to me it could make for a very nice weekend trip . 
  glad to hear that you liked my hometown !, 
  i 'm not sure about the graveyard you 're talking about , could it be gorizia 's cemetery ? 
  it 's just out of town . 
  almost all cemeteries in italy have cypress trees . 
  dublin is a beatiful city , but it surprised me for being a little low-key for a nation 's capital . 
  a guinness in dublin tastes better than anywhere else . 
  most of the country is rural ( ? ), 
  beautiful romantic coast with ruins and castles . 
  low taxation . 
  used to have a strong economy , badly hit by the sovereign debt crisis . 
  a hub for investment funds and other financial firms . 
  mass emigration to the us in the past . 
  an history of famine and oppression . 
  strongly catholic , even more than italy or spain . 
  associated with the color green . 
  there is an official irish language , along with english . 
  lots of music came out of ireland in the last 30 years . 
  also , lots of writers , both old and recent . 
  germany is n't twice as large as italy , having 80 millions inhabitants versus italy 's 60 millions . 
  homicide rate is indeed slightly higher in italy than in germany , but the difference is not dramatic : 690 homicides per year in germany ( rate of 0.8 ) versus 529 in italy ( rate of 0.9 ) . 
  both countries have a lower homicide rate than the majority of other european countries , including france , finland , portugal , greece , and the uk .

  maybe they did n't want the paramedics to save the wounded 's man life . 
  i did n't find a plausible explanation in the news . 
  that basically sums up our newscasts . 
  also , i might have skipped a couple of accidents and suicides . 
  ** italy ** a a man wounded another with a knife during a traffic dispute in a rough neighborhood in rome . 
  the father of the victim , travelling with his son , shot the attacker in the head with his pistol . 
  when the ambulance arrived , an angry mob attacked the paramedics ( it 's not clear whether the attackers were relatives of the wounded or of the murdered man ) ; a paramedic had his shoulder dislocated . 
  a janitor at an elementary school in sicily shot and killed a teacher with his pistol , allegedly over an unresponded love . 
  a woman in naples was killed by a century old pine tree falling over her car . 
  a man in foligno killed her girlfriend with a knife on the street , then committed suicide on the spot . 
  a florist in naples set himself on fire in the city hall , protesting for a negated permit . 
  he then threw himself out of a window , killing himself . 
  a young woman was found in coma in a trash bag . 
  his lover was later arrested for attempted murder . 
  a 21-year old american student in rome fell to his death into the bank of the river tiber , probably because of drunkenness . 
  a top brass of the secret services was arrested for allegedly subtracting $ 10 million of funds from the ministry of the interior . 
  italian prisons are overcrowded ; the government is thinking of reducing every inmate 's sentence by six months , in order to ease the strain on the prison facilities . 
  the weather was unseasonably cold until a couple of days ago . 
  it is now too hot . 
  i do n't see gay couples to be allowed to adopt children anytime in our lifetime in italy , it 's still a highly controversial topic here . 
  gay marriage is less controversial , so maybe within the next decade we 'll have some sort of officially recognized civil union for gay couples . 
  i bet the word `` marriage '' will never be used , though . 
  the good ones were already taken . 
  slovenians ( and other people from yugoslavia in general ) were free to travel abroad during the cold war , because their country was one of the `` non-aligned '' , meaning they did n't side neither with the usa , nor with ussr . 
  as i understand your father lived in czechoslovakia . 
  could he travel freely to austria ? 
  i remember in the '80s , living on the italian-yugoslavian border , there were many escapes of citizens of warsaw pact countries . 
  for example , my family hosted for a few days a young man from bratislava who escaped through the yugoslavian border ( my grandparents found him taking cover in a telephone booth and brought him home ) . 
  he told us he was allowed to travel to yugoslavia , but not to western countries . 
  coming from italy , this does n't seem very odd to me , 
  my ancestors were subjects of the austrian empire , my great-grandfather ( an ethnic italian from istria ) fought for austria 's kuk kriegsmarine during wwi , he was a sailor on the `` herzherzog franz ferdinand '' . 
  the italian provinces of bolzano , trento , trieste and gorizia still use the austrian land register system , that differs from the one used in the rest of italy . 
  austria is a wonderful tourist destination , i especially love carinthia . 
  vienna is one of europe 's most beautiful cities , loaded with culture and history . 
  in general , austria seems to me a wonderful place to live in , with a strong economy , a great nature , and a lively culture . 
  as an outside observer , i could n't think of any negative aspects about austria . 
  exactly , and it 's not even hot currently in italy , we are having an unusually cold june . 
  it 's shocking that an outside temperature of 21c is high enough to kill a child in a car . 
  you mean the elections ? 
  we do n't have the results yet . 
  it 's been a busy week in ** italy ** : * a gas station owner was shot and killed in pesaro on monday in an attempted robbery ; today the police arrested two suspects , one was an employee of the victim ; * a man forgot his 2-year old son in his car and went to work . 
  the child died because of the heat . 
  * an italian soldier was killed in afghanistan by a bomb thrown in his armored car by an 11-year old . 
  * a bar owner near turin was shot and killed in his bar in an attempted robbery . 
  * a man involved in criminal activities in the past was killed by a gunshot to his head out of his home near milan . 
  * a 18-month boy was killed by the family dogs in his home . 
  * a troubled 17-year old went to his school wearing camouflage and carrying a shotgun . 
  he did n't shoot , claiming he was going to commit suicide and that he did n't want to harm anyone else .
