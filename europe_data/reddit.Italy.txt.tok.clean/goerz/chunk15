  i did the fl\u00e5m railway and it was amazing , worth every penny . 
  i know very little , so let 's see what i can remember . 
  their language is a mix of arabic and sicilian , judging by how it sounds . 
  most people are catholic . 
  english is also an official language , i think , but the reasons are hazy to me . 
  during wwii it was a british stronghold in the middle of the mediterranean , which resisted despite intense air bombing by german and italian forces . 
  at one point , however , there were only three working fighter planes on the island , renamed faith , hope , and charity . 
  i do n't think a land invasion during wwii was ever attempted , also because the island is heavily fortified . 
  they are home to a religious warrior order created during the crusades , the maltese knights , still in existence , as far as i know ( minus the warrior part ) . 
  from the pictures i have seen , there is a wonderful rocky coastline , especially in the island of gozo . 
  their economy is based on fishing , agriculture , and ... ? 
  i 'm not sure what else they do . 
  all those words are derived from ancient greek , with the exception of chemistry , which probably has an arabic origin . 
   also , afaik , the italians do n't vote on who 's going to occupy what seats in the government , but rather a party 's spokesperson who may or not be lying about what his party 's going to do once elected and what kind of people they are . 
  there are over 250 types of bread in italy , with a lot of regional variations . 
  for example : [ bread of altamura , puglia ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/pane_altamura.jpg ) [ sicilian bread ] ( http://www.panificiofratellipugliese.it/images/pane_05_big.jpg ) [ piadina ( flatbread ) romagnola ] ( http://www.albertobarbazza.it/ricette/images/piadina_romagnola.jpg ) [ sardinian `` carasau '' bread ] ( http://www.examiner.com/images/blog/exid15944/images/pane-carasau1.jpg ) [ rye bread ] ( http://machetiseimangiato.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/pane-segale_alveoli.jpg ) [ grissini ( breadstick ) ] ( http://farm1.static.flickr.com/58/165460334_05367420e3_o.jpg ) [ maize bread ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hlc20lhnwyk/tzeog_ftxii/aaaaaaaabwu/eo0wmixdsau/s1600/dsc04078.jpg ) [ chestnut bread ] ( http://www.greenme.it/images/stories/animali/pane-di-castagne.jpg ) [ rosetta ] ( http://www.online-news.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/rosetta.jpg ) [ francese  ] ( http://cdn.gingerandtomato.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/baguette-c.jpg ), 
  some historical tidbits i can recall : the ottoman empire was europe 's archenemy for a long time , but in the battle of lepanto in 1571 a coalition of catholic states defeated a large ottoman fleet . 
  the turks later in history went as far as to vienna , but they were eventually defeated . 
  they were known for their cruelty and for the extravagant tortures they inflicted to their prisoners . 
  as a side note , in the 1600s the city of graz , in austria , decided to build a large arsenal where to amass a large quantity of armor and weapons , in order to contrast a possible turkish attack . 
  the turks never came , and the arsenal is still standing in its pristine condition , fully equipped with wonderful 17th century weaponry . 
  modern day turkey has large population and a large army . 
  army generals play an important role in national politics , and so do muslim politicians . 
  it has a large gun industry , producing some reasonably priced shotguns and rifles ( i 'm considering getting an hatsan shotgun myself ) . 
  turkey is also famous for [ meerschaum pipes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meerschaum ) , wonderfully shaped by skilled artisans . 
  turkey is an important nato member , and the americans would like to see turkey admitted into the european union . 
  europeans are generally less inclined , because turkey is large , poor , and muslim . 
  edit : in italian we say `` to speak turkish '' as for `` to speak gibberish '' ( we also have a more up to date version : `` to speak arab '' ) . 
  also , someone who `` smokes like a turk '' is a heavy cigarette chain smoker . 
  some activists in italy 's democratic party who want to change the way the party has been led so far call themselves `` young turks '' . 
  finally , the historical exclamation `` mamma li turchi !, 
  '' , meaning `` mom the turks have arrived ! '', 
  suggests imminent danger , since the enemy is at the door . 
  edit2 : when the ottoman empire conquered constantinople in the 15th century , a lot of scholars fled to italy , bringing with them the knowledge of ancient greek , thus sparking renaissance humanism , which led to a splendid period for the arts in italy . 
  indeed , i hope i 'll have more pleasant news for you next week . 
  no , i think he suspected she had another boyfriend . 
  the most horrifying aspect of this crime is that the boyfriend , after stabbing the girl , wounding her , went fetching the gasoline and returned to her after an hour or so , burning her alive in cold blood . 
  he was arrested almost immediately , and an angry mob surrounded the police station where he was detained , chanting `` leave him to us !, 
  ** italy ** * three men shot and killed in rome in the same day , in three different occasions . 
  reasons are unclear , maybe something to do with the criminal underworld . 
  * a 17-year boy in calabria stabbed and then burned alive with gasoline his 16-year old girlfriend over matters of jealousy . 
  * grillo 's 5 star movement suffered a serious setback in sunday 's local elections . 
  * a headless woman 's corpse found in the water in venice . 
  she 's not been identified yet . 
  outside of the largest cities , public transportation is not very good in italy . 
  you often need a car to get to work . 
  i definitely do . 
  people also tweet in languages other than english . 
  i eat rabbit once a week on average . 
  i did n't realize it was n't common . 
  i confess i do n't know much . 
  their language is similar to finnish . 
  i remember battle scenes on the news when they became independent ( or were they from some otherbbaltic state ? ) . 
  they were an important military industrial center , later converted to civilian productions . 
  i own a pair of estonian-made hi-fi audes loudspeaker , and i 'm very happy with them . 
  stellar quality at an affordable price . 
  they were not in finance , but maybe i was just unlucky . 
  they were otherwise perfectly likable persons . 
  anyway , even when people did n't tell me outright how much they made , money was always a hot discussion topic . 
  i understand not everybody eats horse meat , but rabbit ? 
  i thought everybody loved rabbits . 
  you are right , i guess you can find those varieties only in supermarkets that carry wines from south tirol ( it 's the norm in my area ) . 
  we might not have many cereals , but italian supermarkets have long aisles devoted to pasta , and a large selection of wines and spirits . 
  i 'm not aware of any similar campaign in italy , but we usually include fresh seasonal vegetables and fruit in our diet anyway , as a habit . 
  of course things could improve , and in fact there was a half-assed campaign in schools last year , aimed at giving pupils fruit a day , as a snack . 
  the quality of the fruit , however , was abysmal . 
  we do the same in italy , special lines , lasting several hours , just for immigrants wanting to apply for a residence permit . 
  i ca n't believe it 's not done on purpose . 
  the current lack of liberalisation in the job market in southern europe is very beneficial to me ( i ca n't be fired ) and very detrimental to you ( you ca n't be hired ) . 
  it is saddening that you advocate even less liberalisation , against your own interests . 
  german toilets are designed to make you spend some quality time with your turds . 
  also , in typical german fastidiousness , these toilets allow you to closely inspect your stool for any sign of disease . 
  i lived in the usa for a short time and , although i was n't completely unprepared , some things still stroke me as odd . 
  1 ) in large cities , some shops are open 24 hours a day . 
  bookshops are open until late in the night , and they let people read their books and magazines . 
  2 ) coffee shops in bookshops ( this was new for me in the '90s ) 3 ) in new york city , university conferences were sometimes held at odd times ( 8am , 1pm ... ) , and refreshments were often served . 
  as a penniless student , it was a good chance to get a free meal . 
  4 ) i was carded in pubs , but i was always let in even if i did n't have any id with me . 
  5 ) homeless people 6 ) drive-thru atms 7 ) people eating and drinking while walking in large cities . 
  8 ) students eating and drinking in the classroom at the university ( in some places it 's forbidden though ) . 
  9 ) drinking coffee with your meal at lunch . 
  10 ) you ca n't drink alcohol on the street ( unless you 're in new orleans ) . 
  i finally understood why people in american movies always kept their booze bottles in brown paper bags . 
  11 ) people were surprisingly warm and welcoming . 
  12 ) adults wearing shorts as soon as the temperature rises above freezing ( this was in colorado ) . 
  13 ) tipping 14 ) all rental cars are auto shift . 
  i had to ask the rental car attendant how to drive them . 
  15 ) people are quite direct when talking about money . 
  i encountered a few people boasting a bit too much about their earnings . 
  banning olive oil jugs is so much easier than tackling real problems . 
   a better solution would be to quit letting refugees into italy in the case of the refugees from libya , that was little italy could do , short of sinking their ships . 
  they just landed in italy 's southernmost sicilian island .
